 9,But in several cities the yen to share New York's festivities has reached mass proportions. Near Los Angeles in the city of Newport Beach 1500 people are expected to gather at the Newporter Resort where the unveiling of the renovated Statue of Liberty will be monitored on 30 television sets including 10 with large screens. In Dallas and in Boston's City Hall Plaza as well giant outdoor televisions will show the event. Miamian Is ExpectantHuge numbers of people of course will be on hand in New York including Mary Murphy a 66-year-old Miamian whose hometown is planning nothing much for the holiday. She won first prize for the slogan ''Liberty is in all of us'' in the city-sponsored ''Search for Liberty'' contest one of many contests around the country that offered a trip to New York as the grand prize.''I really love New York'' she said adding that she and her sister will spend July 4 aboard the Spirit of Miami the tall ship that will represent her city in New York Harbor. ''I still don't believe I'm going to have a front row seat at this historical event.''For many around the country Independence Day weekend will include athletic competition. On July 6 more than 1000 men and women are expected to participate in the Liberty-to-Liberty Triathlon a 107-mile swimming bicycling and running race from Liberty State Park in New Jersey to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. Before they climb into the Hudson River at the start of the race the athletes will sing the national anthem and when they cross the finish line they will by met by Mayor W. Wilson Goode.''If you can't beat New York you can join them'' said Dianne L. Semingson Philadelphia's official promoter. Events Around the NationIn a similar test of endurance 24 marathoners from Houston have been running toward New York since June 22. If all goes as planned the last of the runners who have run continuously in relay teams will reach the George Washington Bridge July 3.In Detroit where Independence Day is celebrated with Canada Day which is July 1 residents of two nations will participate in a tug-of-war on July 2 yanking opposite ends of a rope that will stretch 2350 feet across the Detroit River. And in the choppy waters of the San Francisco Bay the architects of two yachts both computer-designed will stage a runoff to determine which one the U.S.A. or the R-1 will be entered in the trials for the 1987 America's Cup race in Australia.One thing there may be less of than usual is fireworks. Rising insurance premiums and growing public awareness about the dangers of fireworks have caused many towns to forfeit their displays particularly in the Southwest where dry hot weather has increased the threat of fire. In Sierra Vista Ariz. for example the Rotary Club canceled its annual show when it could not raise the money for liability coverage. The cost would have been $2 million.

 9,Sematech the ambitious industry research consortium designed to restore the ability of the American semiconductor industry to compete with the Japanese is having difficulties finding a chief executive.The consortium has been trying to hire an experienced executive from one of its member companies. But the companies are reluctant to part with key personnel and have made it attractive for the executives to stay. This difficulty is viewed as an indication that the 14 member companies are less inclined to share their manpower for the common good than has been publicly proclaimed.''Sematech will suffer if we don't get someone in soon'' said Robert N. Noyce vice chairman of the Intel Corporation and a member of a three-member committee charged with finding a chief executive. Pentagon AnnoyedThe inability of the industry to find a leader for its much touted research consortium is frustrating the Department of Defense which is underwriting half of the cost and impeding planning for the project Government and industry officials said.

 9,So powerful has television become in the West that it has supplanted poster art as the major tool of mass persuasion. True many European political parties still produce marvelous posters and American groups that can't afford television spots still rely on posters. But nowadays works such as the 1968 peace dove that Ben Shahn did for the Eugene McCarthy Presidential campaign seem designed less to win mass support than to warm the hearts of the already faithful.Those with fond memories of such posters will have a chance to see some fine examples this weekend when the New York Poster Postcard and Photograph show at the New York Sheraton features an exhibition of propaganda art.Moving Tales of the WarTwo of the most moving posters in the display put together by the Chisholm Prats Gallery are creations of Mr. Shahn. One depicts a hooded man against a brick wall about to be shot. The headline reads ''This is Nazi Brutality'' and superimposed on the picture is type from a Western Union wire reporting the slaughter of an entire village by the Nazis. A second shows a group of French workers their arms over their heads reading a Vichy decree requiring everyone to work for the war effort. The faces are a frightening mixture of impassivity and fear. The message on top - ''We French workers warn you ... defeat means slavery starvation and death'' - is almost unnecessary. But you get the point.The choice of the Chisholm Prats gallery to put together the show is fortunate since Lucas Prats one of the partners in the Greenwich Village concern has assembled an extraordinary collection of Spanish Civil War posters. As George Orwell noted Republican-controlled Spain was always awash in posters. They were the major medium of communication between the leftist-led Government its often violently competitive factions and their following of poor and often illiterate workers and peasants.

 9,For Ben Feder the Clinton campaign has been a bonanza. Mr. Feder is a pioneer Hudson Valley vintner. Since 1977 he has made a crisp dry white wine from the seyval blanc grape. Mr. Feder's estate is in Clinton Corners N.Y. and his label says Clinton Vineyards.By late October Mr. Feder usually has 700 cases of vintage-dated still wine in stock and 150 of nonvintage sparkling wine. But today his inventory has shrunk to 95 and 25 respectively. With the election approaching Democrats thirsty for more than the White House have rung the winery's phone off the hook.He could have sold every bottle during the Democratic Convention. But he kept some just in case Clinton headquarters called from Little Rock. "If there's an inauguration I'll need 750 to 1000 cases " he said. "I'm beating my brains out trying to figure out what to do."Mr. Feder's 1991 vintage was the best since 1984. With one eye he is watching his 1992 seyval evolve in tanks. With the other he's watching the tightening polls and wondering if the bubbles in the Democrats' champagne will go flat Tuesday night.
 9,Will Deutsche Bank's $10.1 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust be the big banking merger that actually melds vastly different cultures titanic egos and far-flung businesses?Luckily for Bankers Trust shareholders they need not wait around to find out. Because the deal is for cash rather than shares of Deutsche Bank Bankers Trust shareholders can take the money and run.And it is a tidy sum. According to the terms of the deal announced yesterday shareholders in Bankers Trust will receive $93 a share in cash for a stock that was trading at about $62 a share two weeks ago. When the market swooned in early October the shares had fallen to $49.1875 from the April high of $136.4375.Deutsche Bank's price for Bankers Trust is equivalent to 2.3 times the book value of Bankers Trust and 15.8 times consensus earnings estimates for 1999 of $5.90 a share. The premium to book value is in line with the average price to book value -- 2.4 times -- that investors are now paying for shares of five big United States investment firms.

 0,Out-of-towners traveling to New York City specifically to commit suicide have accounted for 5.3 percent of city suicides and more than 10 percent of all Manhattan suicides since 1990 according to a new research study. The two highest concentrations of such suicides took place near the George Washington Bridge in Upper Manhattan and in the Midtown tourism district which includes Times Square the Empire State Building and other skyscrapers and most of the city’s major hotels.Nonresidents committed 21 to 40 suicides in each of those two areas from 1990 to 2004 according to the study which is to be presented on Monday to the American Public Health Association at its annual meeting in Washington. The research paper [pdf] “Suicide Tourism in Manhattan New York City 1990–2004” appears in the November/December issue of The Journal of Urban Health.“These data suggest that there are individuals who travel to a distant location and take their lives” said David Vlahov director of the Center for Urban Epidemiologic Studies at the New York Academy of Medicine which released the study today. (The report’s use of the provocative phrase “suicide tourism” caught the attention of The Daily News this morning.)The academy which publishes the urban health journal called the study the “first known effort to document the number and characteristics of individuals who travel substantial distances to commit suicide.” The lead author is Charles Gross who is affiliated with the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University and the clinical psychology program at the City University of New York Graduate Center.Researchers from the academy and other institutions reviewed by hand records of all suicides in New York City from 1990 to 2004 poring over files in the office of the city’s chief medical examiner which is responsible for assessing all unnatural deaths in the city.Suicide is considered a major and preventable public health problem. In the United States suicide is the 11th leading cause of death accounting for for 32439 deaths in 2004 according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Anyone in a suicidal crisis is urged to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).The new study suggests that some people may “seek the opportunity for suicide outside their proximal environment and often in well-known places.”Between 1990 and 2004 there were a total of 7634 suicides in New York City: 94.7 percent were committed by city residents and 5.3 percent (or 407) by nonresidents. Of the 407 nonresident suicides 274 occurred in Manhattan accounting for more than 10 percent of all the suicides in Manhattan.The most common methods of suicide for the Manhattan nonresidents were: jumping (from a tall place) hanging overdose drowning and firearms. The most common locations included hotels and commercial buildings followed by outside locations like bridges parks and streets.In a statement Dr. Vlahov said he hoped his research would assist with suicide prevention efforts. “As with locations such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the Eiffel Tower that are repeatedly used for suicide certain locales in Manhattan and other urban areas may require further prevention efforts such as greater public awareness surveillance available hot line phones and suicide barriers” he said.In a phone interview today Dr. Herbert Hendin a psychiatrist and a leading authority on suicides said the phenomenon of “hot spots” for suicide has been well documented. (In October 2003 for example The New Yorker published an extensive article about the large number of suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge.)Dr. Hendin the president and medical director of Suicide Prevention International said there is a commonly held but incorrect view that suicide barriers are ineffective because people will find a way to kill themselves anyway. In fact he said barriers have been shown to be effective; physical deterrents have often dissuaded people who wanted to kill themselves in prominent locations to attract publicity.Dr. Hendin who helped found the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention did raise some caveats about the new study — particularly its title and the use of the term “suicide tourism.”“I think that’s silly because that implies they came here to be tourists and somehow were unhappy here” he said. “It’s a terribly unhelpful title.”Dr. Hendin also said that the term “nonresidents” needed clarification. He noted that many people live in the city’s suburbs and work in Manhattan; should such people properly be considered nonresidents? Also he said there is not much comparative research that would show whether the proportion of out-of-town suicides in New York City is higher than in other places.Nonetheless the new study does present interesting details for mental health experts. Nonresidents who committed suicide tended to be younger than their resident counterparts: 47.5 percent of nonresident suicides were committed by people under the age of 35 (compared with 29.4 percent among suicides of city residents in Manhattan) and only 2.6 percent of nonresident suicides were committed by people over 75 years old (compared with 10.9 percent among residents).Nonresident suicide subjects also tended to be more often white or Asian than resident suicides and less often black or Hispanic. Male victims accounted for nearly 80 percent of nonresident suicides in Manhattan compared with 70 percent of suicides among residents.Of the nonresident suicides 59.5 percent were committed in locations coded by the chief medical examiner’s office as “other inside” such as hotels and other nonresidential interiors; 25.5 percent were committed in outside locations such as parks streets and bridges. Among suicides of city residents in Manhattan the vast majority (75.1 percent) occurred inside a home.
 0,Where Mr. Clarke is the high priest of sci-fi's faith in the human intellect manifest in technology Mr. Ballard and the others regard technology as a dangerous extension of human psychopathology. Thus in "Crash" the automobile is a tool for sex and self-destruction. In "High-Rise" and the more recent "Cocaine Nights" and "Super-Cannes" the globally replicated blandness of modern cities highways and airports is the environment of a new totalitarianism that is he says here "docile and subservient and all the more threatening for that." "The New Totalitarians come forward" he writes "smiling obsequiously like head waiters in third-rate Indian restaurants and assuring us that everything is for our benefit."Technology not only threatens but also disappoints. Mr. Ballard is almost cruel on the collapse of the space age. Rockets "belong to the age of the 19th century along with the huge steam engines. It's brute-force ballistic technology that has nothing to do with what people recognize as the characteristic technology of this century: microprocessors microwave data links -- everything that goes in the world at the speed of an electron."Worse the space race made for lousy television. "The suspicion dawned that Outer Space might be -- dare one say it -- boring. Having expended all these billions of dollars on getting to the Moon we found on our arrival that there wasn't very much to do there."Mr. Ballard saw the World Trade Center attack as a kind of brutal intrusion of the imminent future into the present. "The attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 was a brave attempt to free America from the 20th Century" he opines. "The deaths were tragic but otherwise it was a meaningless act." And in another passage: "The horrific newsreels are effectively the greatest disaster movie to date. My fear is that in due course the 'remake' of 9/11 with the ultimate in special effects will inspire Americans to more than revenge."He is not usually so callous. In 2001 he remarked: "Americans are highly moralistic and any kind of moral ambiguity irritates them. As a result they completely fail to understand themselves which is one of their strengths." And this feels like inescapable truth: "The president of the United States bears about as much relationship to the real business of running America as does Colonel Sanders to the business of frying chicken."

 9,''It's so much beyond any expectation'' said an ebullient Mr. Trump who had said that he had hoped to just break even or turn a modest profit of about $100000. ''This is a little different ending than most city stories.''Mr. Stern agreed that the rink was ''enormously successful.'' Record AdmissionsBut the Trump Organization still has a lot of negotiating to do with the city if it is to continue to operate the rink. Mr. Gliedman said the two sides are far apart on some key aspects of the proposed concession contract such as its duration and the fate of the Lasker Rink in Central Park near 103d Street.The Trump Organization has asked for a 10-year agreement Mr. Gliedman said and the city has offered one for 4 years.Mr. Stern declined yesterday to discuss the negotiations. ''We have a lot of negotiating to do'' he said.Mr. Trump took over the project in June 1986 after two city studies had concluded that the renovation was a failure. The city agreed to allow Mr. Trump to take over the project with both agreeing that all profits would go to public works projects and charities suggested by city officials and approved by Mr. Trump.The project was completed two and a half months ahead of schedule and cost about $750000 less than the $3 million that it was budgeted for.Mr. Stern said the profits came from an unexpectedly high turnout in the winter. He said that about 225000 people bought the $4.50 admission tickets to the rink as of March 24. Mr. Gliedman said the Trump Organization believes an additional 25000 people used the rink from March 24 to Monday.
 0,BEIRUT Lebanon — Iranian officials reacted with unified irritation on Thursday to the Trump administration’s decision to sanction Iran’s foreign minister calling the move petty and provocative — further evidence they said of Washington’s insincerity when it talks of peace.The foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif an American-educated diplomat who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal that President Trump rejected last year is one of Iran’s best-known leaders and perhaps its most effective in making his country’s case to the West. The sanctions imposed on Wednesday could make it more difficult to engage in the new diplomacy that Mr. Trump says he wants.With Iran and the United States locked for months on the brink of armed conflict Iran’s leaders are often viewed as split between hard-liners who urge confrontation and moderates like Mr. Zarif who support diplomacy.But Western analysts see the punishment of Mr. Zarif as the latest in a series of signs that the Trump administration is itself deeply divided over the right approach to Iran — and that despite Mr. Trump’s insistence that he wants to negotiate his most hawkish advisers are not interested in diplomacy.

 9,Indeed the nonprofit institutions traditionally relied on for incubating transfer hits -- Lincoln Center Theater the Joseph Papp Public Theater the Manhattan Theater Club -- all failed to deliver. So did a dazzling assembly of some of this country's finest playwrights. Ms. Wasserstein's ''American Daughter'' Craig Lucas's ''God's Heart'' Christopher Durang's ''Sex and Longing'' and Lanford Wilson's ''Sympathetic Magic'' were muddled disappointments.Yet if these plays were to different degrees failures they were noble failures hamstrung by nothing less than their desire to tackle big subjects. The problem was that each wore its themes (politics and sex politics and gender politics and cosmology) like bumper stickers without connecting them to any persuasive sense of character or situation. Granted the theater of polemics if invested with enough outrage can occasionally flare entertainingly as a sustained rant. Witness Jonathan Reynolds's fiery if long-winded diatribe against political correctness ''Stonewall Jackson's House.'' But it usually takes more than a Shavian debate especially without Shavian vitality to hold our emotions.Consider the Vineyard Theater's ''How I Learned to Drive'' one of only two not-for-profit productions to make a commercial transfer. (It is now at the Century Theater Center.) In it Ms. Vogel embraces a subject child molestation that has been too tidily and too often rehashed in best sellers and TV movies and turns it into a seductive memory play that startles at every turn undermining easy assumptions in both form and content. Under Mark Brokaw's deceptively light-handed direction with terrific performances by David Morse and Mary-Louise Parker the production gives the illusion of coming to troubled life before your eyes. Gracefully stylized it also generates a sense of spontaneity that never lets its audience become too comfortable.That is what one asks of the theater of course and what no other medium can provide. In a world increasingly dominated by replicated distancing images theater exists unconditionally in the present tense and at its best appears to invent itself on the spot. Again the formula for creating such magic isn't easily broken down.Who would have thought for example that 19th-century courtroom transcripts generously laced with academic and contemporary journalistic commentary could be edited and shaped into something as sensationally involving as Moises Kaufman's ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde''? Mr. Kaufman both the writer and director of the play (the other nonprofit commercial transfer this time to the Minetta Lane) has created a work as artificial and mannered as a Wildean epigram. Yet within minutes of the first scene you have accepted its terms; you have already learned to think in other words in the original theatrical language that Mr. Kaufman has devised.Wilde himself (Michael Emerson in a career-making performance) effectively loses his case when the artistic frame through which he sees and presents life slips. Because Mr. Kaufman expertly holds onto his stylistic frame which locates the protagonist both in time and in history he allows us to experience Wilde's real pain all the more acutely. A Wildean paradox in itself its use achieves an effect of which both film and written fiction are incapable.''The Waste Land'' T. S. Eliot's recondite generation-defining poem of 1922 seemed to be another most unlikely candidate for theatrical adaptation. Yet the brilliant Irish actress Fiona Shaw in a one-woman show directed by Deborah Warner brought a specific emotional clarity to the work that never stooped to literal explanations. The result was astonishingly affecting.
 9,The Bethlehem Steel Corporation stung by sharply lower steel prices and higher operating costs said yesterday that its third-quarter net income dropped 78 percent. Bethlehem the nation's second-largest steel company also said the level of shipments dropped 6 percent for the quarter.Bethlehem like other leading steel makers was hurt by the widespread price discounting in the industry in the quarter as previously announced price increases failed to stick.The company reported net income of $10.1 million or 5 cents a share compared with $46.9 million or 53 cents a share in the 1989 period. Sales for the quarter declined 4.7 percent to $1.21 billion from $1.27 billion. The third quarter of 1989 included $105 million in charges for restructuring and reducing the size of two of its operations.While price discounting has affected the earnings of several other steel companies Bethlehem has been particularly vulnerable because it has few operations outside of steel. Also Bethlehem is the only big producer that has no joint ventures with foreign steel companies. Underlying Problems

 0,Chris Trotman/Getty ImagesThe transcript of Juergen Klinsmann’s introductory news conference on Monday reads like “War and Peace” but we’ve pulled out some of the big picture ideas that were discussed. The complete transcript is available at ussoccer.com.Klinsmann on the state of the team:“I don’t think there is anything wrong with the team. They lost a Gold Cup final against a very very good Mexico team that over the last couple of years became one of the top 10 teams in the world and have a lot of talent. When you come into a situation like this you analyze every individual player the team itself and the program which I’ll have the chance to do during the next couple of weeks to see how I can develop them further. You build on what was built before and if you look back on the past 20 years in this country a lot has been built.”On his coaching philosophy:“Having played abroad in different countries Italy France and Germany I have my own ideas for the program. And I will step by step introduce the ideas that I have always double checking if it suits the American game. I’m not coming in here to be the European guy. I’ve lived here for 13 years so I think I know a lot about certain issues. But I think you can also be proud of what you’ve achieved over the last few years where soccer is now.”On soccer in the United States:“I deeply believe that soccer in a certain way reflects the culture of a country. Having studied the U.S. culture over the last 13 years it’s quite a challenge. You have such a melting pot in this country with so many different opinions and ideas floating around there. Every coach obviously has his own ideas and then you have the whole challenge of youth soccer in this country being based on a very different model than anywhere else in the world. Your educational system is completely different than the rest of the world. One of my challenges will be to find a way to define how a U.S. team should represent its country. What should be the style of play? Is it more proactive and aggressive a forward-thinking style of play? Or is it more reacting style of play? That comes with the players that you have at your disposal but also the people that you are surrounded with and the people that have an opinion in this country like the media like coaches. There’s such a wealth of knowledge in this country.”On settling on a particular style and building from the grass roots up:“If you talk about Brazil you know how Brazil plays. You know about Argentina you know about Italy. They sit back and wait for one mistake and if you do they’re going to kill you. We defined that with Germany in 2004 which was a very difficult process but we worked through that process and now it’s settled that style of play. Your opinion is important. College coaches’ opinions are important. Youth coaches’ opinions are important. Everyone is involved in that process players as well. I’m looking forward to a lot of talks.”On his roster for the Aug. 10 game against Mexico which will be announced Wednesday:“I spoke to about five six players over the weekend. We were extremely busy to get this whole thing organized and get officially ready to work and move forward towards the Mexico game. I spoke to five or six players and I will call the rest tomorrow.”On building a coaching staff:“I won’t confirm a full time staff over the next couple of months because I want to see what’s out there. There are a lot of good highly qualified coaches in the U.S. that I might not know. I need to talk to people and understand what’s out there. We’ll talk to a lot of M.L.S. coaches and get their perspective and see who I can invite as guest coaches guest assistant coaches. I won’t come in and say this is my staff.”“I had a great conversation with Claudio Reyna and I want Claudio very close to me in terms of helping him in his new role as a Technical Director for Youth Development at the Federation. He will always be a part of the staff and he will sit with us coaches at the table so I can tell him how I look at the game and how I can be of help to him. I spoke to Tab Ramos. I want his perspective and I want his information about what’s coming through in the Under-20 and U-17 level even if I have seen some of those games already and I kind of already know most of the players from watching them but I will take my time.” “One of the fascinating topics we will have over the next months and years is what people can we work with on a global basis? That doesn’t mean you bring in an assistant coach from Europe just to have an assistant coach from Europe but maybe you have some people in Europe that help to work with the U.S. Soccer Federation and they live in Europe. You have the case that probably two thirds of your squad of the best 20 players are in Europe so maybe a thought is ‘Should we have somebody in Europe to oversee those players so I don’t have to fly back and forth every weekend?’ ”On growing better American players:“What is really missing compared to the leading soccer nations around the world the first 10 to 12 nations around the world is the amount of time kids play the game. If you have a kid that plays in Mexico 20 hours a week and maybe 4 hours of organized soccer but 16 hours of unorganized soccer just banging the ball around in the neighborhood but if he gets up to 20 hours it doesn’t matter how he plays it with his dad or with his buddies in the street this will show later on with his technical abilities with his passing with his instinct on the field and all those things and I think that’s certainly an area where a lot of work is ahead of us.”On the expectations for the U.S. team:“Expectations are always based on what was built over the last 10-15 years. When you coach Germany the expectations are to be in the final. Other than the final the country is not happy. I think expectations here certainly are different because of how the game grew in the last 10-20 years. I think a quarterfinal is already huge. I think going through the group stage is really really important and then going to the knockout stage where anything is possible. But obviously you want to improve you want to get better you want to be better than the last World Cup and the World Cup before but you can’t promise anything because once you’re in the knockout stage anything can happen.”U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati on the reasons he has long pursued Klinsmann:“Juergen’s experience both as a player and coach and as a resident of this country – and I think all three of those are important – we think are huge assets. The latter solves whatever we think about having an international coach and whether they’ll know America and know the difference between Duke (University) and the Portland Timbers and all the things that are specific to the U.S. like the role of education geography and so on.”Gulati on his past negotiations with Klinsmann:“Between [Juergen and I] there has never been an issue of control. I think that’s a bit of a red herring. Juergen’s comments previously were about being able to incorporate that onto a piece of paper. The understanding that we’ve had about moving forward and collaborating quite frankly has been pretty clear for many years.”Klinsmann again:“I reached a comfort level with Sunil where I really think it’s not about a paper anymore.”Most of the U.S. players have been silent since their statements thanking the departing Bob Bradley but here’s one one from Landon Donovan on Klinsmann via ESPN.com’s Scott French:“I have the benefit of having played under Juergen a little bit [while on loan in early 2009] at Bayern Munich and I think one of his biggest attributes is just his positive energy and I think he brings real excitement and good energy and I think that’s going to be really helpful for our guys.”Corner kick: Did you like what you heard from Klinsmann on Monday? Or how about this: Are you willing to trade disappointment in the short term (read: 2014) for progress and a stronger foundation built around some of the developmental ideas he laid out on Monday?

 9,Pat Robertson's well-heeled Presidential campaign adjusted its financial course again today by agreeing to accept $4.5 million in Federal matching funds. But it pledged to put the money in escrow while Mr. Robertson decides whether to keep it or try to give it back.Mr. Robertson the former television minister has raised $11 million and is eligible for the additional $4.5 million in matching money. He had asked the Federal Election Commission to delay dispensing the matching money for 30 days while he decided whether to accept it.However the Robertson campaign today withdrew the request and on Monday will receive the $4.5 million from the United States Treasury.Mr. Robertson's campaign manager R. Marc Nuttle said that the campaign ''plans to segregate the funds'' while deciding ''whether to seek an advisory opinion from the F.E.C. about the possibility of giving the money back to the American taxpayers without incurring any liabilities.''
 9,Why do they do it? Why do real-estate developers and other big business interests in New York contribute to political campaigns contribute so generously that their largess can still stun the uninitiated? (And sometimes the initiated.) The question is as fundamental as such matters get in politics. The answers are as recent hearings before a state panel demonstrated not so simple.For two days a glittery roster of developers the newest category of New York City celebrity testified before the State Commission on Government Integrity to explain under oath why they give money to public officials especially members of the city's powerful Board of Estimate -Mayor Koch Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin City Council President Andrew J. Stein and the five borough presidents.They touched on everything from the idealistic to the cynical from civic responsibility to fondness for a candidate (and sometimes the candidate's rival too). Some testified that they contributed on the advice of their public relations consultant and still others said they were afraid of retaliation if they did not make contributions.The one interpretation that none provided and all rejected was the most negative and seemingly the most plausible: They give to get. It certainly looks that way. Consider the following cases:* Robert Pressman executive vice president of Barneys New York the retail company testified that the Pressman family corporations contributed $5000 to the Bronx Democratic Committee in January 1985; $10000 to City Council President Andrew J. Stein on March 8 1985 and $20000 to Mr. Koch on April 28. Campaign records show another $5000 contribution to the Mayor in May. It was on Feb. 28 1985 that the Board of Estimate approved a plan for Barney's expansion. The contributions and the power of each board member to vote on the plan had ''nothing to do with each other'' Mr. Pressman testified.

 9,The Mets staged their first full workout of spring training today and delivered some theater to their new audience on Florida's Gold Coast. Dwight Gooden pitched batting practice for the first time and fired the heater past sluggers like Gary Carter and Darryl Strawberry.It was a bit of old magic in a new setting and while it didn't count in anybody's batting or pitching records it did startle the fans and the players. This was a no-nonsense Gooden revving up for the first time this spring for the first time since he lost his bid for a raise in salary arbitration and took a $100000 cut instead.''He was overpowering'' Strawberry said. ''He looks a lot stronger this year. The way he threw today I'd have to say he's throwing more like the year when he won the Cy Young Award.''''I didn't think he was going to be throwing that hard the first time out but he was popping it'' Strawberry said. ''A lot of people asked me is he throwing hard? I said step in and see for yourself.'' Fastball 'Three Weeks Away'

 9,''The question is how far will the reader want to go'' Mr. Straus said. ''The answer I think is far not only because of his reputation but because of his writing persona his style.''The first version of ''August 1914'' was published in Russian while Mr. Solzhenitsyn was still in the Soviet Union. After his exile in 1974 when he was doing research at the Hoover Institution in California he came across new material about Czar Nicholas and his Prime Minister Pyotr A. Stolypin whose correspondence is in the Hoover archives.Much of the revised book's new material deals with Stolypin an imposing figure regarded by many historians as Russia's last best hope for reform - mainly agricultural reform - when the czarist regime was swinging violently between war and revolution.The book offers a dramatic account of Stolypin's assassination in Kiev in September 1911 told from different perspectives including that of the assassin Dmitri Bogrov a young Jewish anarchist who had also been a police informer.When they were first published in Russian by the Y.M.C.A. press in Paris in 1983 these new chapters sparked arguments about Mr. Solzhenitsyn's views on history his brand of Russian nationalism and his penchant for a strong reforming autocracy as contrasted to what he describes as the irresponsible opinions of liberal ''society.'' His unabashed idolization of Stolypin - described as almost saintly in his selfless devotion to Russia the Russian Orthodox Church and the monarchy - was seen by some critics as evidence that Mr. Solzhenitsyn's version of history was too biased to be credible.Some historians dismiss these views as irrelevant. ''A lot of 'War and Peace' was not history either'' said Alexander Riazanovsky a professor of Russian history at the University of Pennsylvania ''but I think Mr. Solzhenitsyn tends to capture more than just history.'' Besides he added ''what account of the Russian Revolution is not opinionated?''Adam Ulam director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University praised Mr. Solzhenitsyn's ''truly astounding'' capacity to digest historical material. ''He has his point of view which is legitimate if obviously partisan because it is enormously well researched'' Mr. Ulam said. ''At a certain point he ceases to be a novelist and becomes a chronicler.''
 9,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students examine where one develops his or her views about health and ways in which teen-agers exhibit these influences focusing particularly on the rising trend of anabolic steroid use in teen-age girls. Students then participate in either developing and analyzing a survey of the student body regarding health and views of fitness or researching and designing an informational pamphlet containing information regarding steroid use and its dangerous effects both which will be distributed to the student body.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes plus homeworkObjectives:Students will:1. Identify and describe a famous person who demonstrates the student’s ideal image of health the attributes this person possesses that illustrate his or her health and the ways in which the media presents this person.2. Develop definitions of health parameters for what is healthy and unhealthy in terms of physical appearance a list of where we develop our ideas of health analysis of methods people use to alter their bodies and the safety of these methods and ways in which people can attain physical health.3. Examine the rising trend of steroid use in teen-age girls the development of one’s perceptions of health the role of various industries in affecting these perceptions and ways in which one can healthfully attain good fitness and well-being by reading and discussing “Steroid Use by Teen-Age Girls Is Rising.”4. Participate in either developing and analyzing a survey of the student body regarding health and views of fitness or researching and designing an informational pamphlet containing information regarding steroid use and its dangerous effects both which will be distributed to the student body.Resources / Materials:-student journals-paper-pens/pencils-classroom blackboards-copies of “Steroid Use by Teen-Age Girls Is Rising” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: Students respond to the following questions in their journals (written on the board prior to class):-What famous person would you say demonstrates the ideal image of health to you?-List attributes that this person has that illustrate his or her health.-How is this person presented in the media?Students then share their answers. The teacher should list physical attributes on the board and keep a tally of how often each attribute is listed. Then discuss why these attributes are considered healthy and whether or not it is realistic for the majority of Americans to attain such attributes.2. Students work in small groups to respond to the following questions:–Without the aid of a dictionary define health.–What do you consider healthy-looking and why?–What do you consider unhealthy-looking and why?–Specifically from where do we develop our ideas of health? Are any of these ideas inaccurate and if so which ones?–What methods do people use to alter their bodies? In what way can each of these methods be dangerous either physically or mentally to the person using such methods?–How does one attain physical health?Students then share and discuss their answers with the class.3. Read and discuss “Steroid Use by Teen-Age Girls Is Rising” focusing on the following questions:a. Why might the trend in anabolic steroid use in teen-age girls be rising?b. What might influence girls to use anabolic steroids in comparison to the reasons why boys may be influenced use them?c. Why do athletes like Mark McGwire use steroids or steroid-like substances when their results are so disputed and may be dangerous?d. What do anabolic steroids do to the human body?e. Why might past teaching methods aimed at warning students of the dangers of steroid use have been ineffective?f. What is meant by the phrase “reverse anorexia” in this article?g. What non-physical effects has steroid use lead to as discussed in the article?h. Why might peer education about steroid use be an effective method of teaching students about the dangers of steroids?i. Do you agree with the final statement that “unless young people are taught to know where and how to draw the line to know that it’s not right to try to win at all costs they’re not going to listen when you tell them steroids put their lives at risk for the glory of winning”? Why or why not? What in our society encourages the notion that winning particularly in athletic competition is important?4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Divide students into two groups. One group will develop a survey to be distributed to the student body regarding health and views of fitness and the other group will design an informational pamphlet containing information regarding steroid use and its dangerous effects which will also be distributed to the student body. Because the groups are working on such different products facilitate each group providing them with the following guidance:SURVEY GROUP: Students in this group will design a survey to be distributed to the student body responded to anonymously and analyzed by group members. Students will then produce a handout with the results and evaluation of survey results. The survey should focus on the health and fitness issues discussed in the featured article and in class (views of what is considered “healthy” and “unhealthy” influences on individuals’ views about health ways that people “alter” their bodies and the use of steroids). To make the survey most statistically accurate survey questions should ask students to answer with responses such as “always sometimes never” or to rank views about health in order of importance. Students should also include a question about the respondent’s gender and a question about whether or not the respondent participates in athletic activities. Distribute surveys to as many members of the student body as possible (perhaps by distributing them to homeroom teachers and asking that these teachers return completed surveys to the class’s teacher’s mailbox). Then calculate and discuss the results and create a handout for the student body that includes this information. The handout should then be distributed to the student body.PAMPHLET GROUP: Students in this group will use research information as the basis for an informational pamphlet to be distributed to the student body. Students should include at least the following in their pamphlet: a definition of “steroid” an explanation of what steroids do to the human body a discussion of why steroid use is hazardous and a list of related resources (books magazine or newspaper articles and Web sites) where students can learn more about steroid use. The pamphlet should then be distributed to the student body.Further Questions for Discussion:–Who might young athletes view as ideal pictures of physical health and why?–What are anabolic steroids and how do they affect the human body? What debate is there with regards to their effectiveness?–For what reasons do you think that the rate of the use of anabolic steroids in high school athletes has risen so dramatically in recent years?–What teaching methods would be effective in relaying to students the dangers of using steroids?–In what ways do the health supplement industry seem to support the use of performance-enhancing drugs?–Why might good performance in athletics be more important than overall or future health to young athletes?–Do athletes have a responsibility to serve as role models to children and why?–In what ways can one maintain physical health without resorting to potentially dangerous body enhancement techniques?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on journal entry response participation in small and large group class discussions and thorough and thoughtful creation and distribution of a school-wide survey and informational pamphlet about steroid use and overall health.Vocabulary:stardom psychological anabolic steroids anorexia anonymous unabated precursor perception inducing unequivocal synthetic prevention congregate injectables preoccupation compulsion dysmorphism excessive defective diuretic vascularExtension Activities:1. Research and create an informational poster describing how steroids affect the human body.2. Create public information posters about the ideals of beauty and health in American society the use of drugs to enhance athletic performance and other often unhealthy techniques used to alter one’s body. Hang posters in visible areas of the school.3. Role-play different scenarios dealing with steroid use and other “personal image” health issues (such as eating disorders or excessive exercise). Ask students to portray various individuals encountering different situations such as being told by a friend that he or she is taking steroids or has an eating disorder. After each scenario is played out discuss as a class the impact of actions and reactions in these situations.4. Write a letter to Mark McGwire or another athlete who has admitted to using steroids to enhance his or her performance. In your letter include your views about steroids and their effects as well as how you feel the public is affected by the use of steroids and other drugs by public figures such as athletes.5. Create magazine or television advertisements (videotaped and shown to the class) that would serve to convince students not to use steroids or other dangerous methods to alter one’s body.6. Examine the intensive training of athletes particularly young world-class amateur and professional athletes in order to prepare for competitions. What training is required in different sports? What limits are imposed on these training techniques?7. Monitor television ads over the course of a week and keep a log of commercials dealing with health and physical beauty. What persuasive techniques do these ads use? To what results do the companies allude?Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research the history of drugs used in athletics in the United States. What legislation has been passed to control body-enhancing drugs by sports figures and others?Fine Arts- Study paintings and other art forms from past centuries focusing on images of beauty in women. Compare those images to the images commonly seen in American culture today.Global Studies- Learn about the methods to attain physical beauty and health common in other countries. How do some of these methods reflect other aspects of the culture such as religion?-Research instances of drugs used by professional athletes in other countries and the consequences both physical and legal that those drugs had on the individuals’ careers.Mathematics- Calculate what Barbie G.I. Joe and other dolls or action figures would really look like if they were life-sized. Students take measurements of the dolls’ body parts from different angles determine the correct ratios if Barbie were 5’7″ and G.I. Joe were 6’0″ and calculate the doll measurements into life-size based on the ratios computed. Students can also draw out these life-sized dolls on a long strip of butcher paper. Results are extremely humorous! How do these types of toys represent an unrealistic “ideal” of what males and females should look like? How do these ideals transfer to thechildren who play with these toys?Teaching with The Times- Create a bulletin board or scrapbook of New York Times articles photographs and advertisements that focus on what is viewed as “beautiful” in American society. For each article picture or ad included describe how “beauty” is discussed in the item and analyze the positive or negative effects that this may have on children adults men and women.Other Information on the Web:The Federal Drug Administration Web site (//www.fda.gov) offers numerous reports and articles about the use and effects of steroids in humans.The National Institute on Drug Abuse (//www.nida.nih.gov/) supports over 85 percent of the world’s research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction and addresses the most fundamental and essential questions about drug abuse ranging from the molecule to managed care and from DNA to community outreach research.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Health Standard 2- Knows environmental and external factors that affect individual and community health.

 0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students explore rules of conduct in a political body first drafting rules that apply to their classroom then adapting them to political actions in Congress.Author(s):Elyse Fischer The New York Times Learning NetworkJavaid Khan The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:In this lesson students will:1. Discover challenges to civil discussions.2. Examine the issue of incivility in the U.S. Congress through reading and discussion of “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill.”3. Carefully consider their class rules based on models and experience. Synthesize their research and experience by creating a new set of class rules.4. Apply their research by amending their class rules for Congress.Resources / Materials:–classroom board–pens/pencils–paper–computers with Internet access–four index cards–tape–copies of “The Importance of Rules” from Thomas Jefferson’s A Manual of Parliamentary Practice ( //www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm) (one for each student)–poster board–markers (enough for students to share)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to the students’ arrival in class arrange the desks in a circle (if space allows). Label four index cards each with one of the following instructions: “Agree with me” “Disagree with me” “Ignore me” and “Interrupt me or tell me to be quiet.”As students enter the room ask for four volunteers to take part in an exercise in civics and civility. Tape a labeled index card to each volunteer’s forehead or back so that he or she cannot read the label. Make sure that everyone else in the class as well as the other discussion participants can read each card. Ask the students to sit in the circle with the volunteers in the center. (If you do not have room for a circle the volunteers may sit in the front of the room.) Explain to the four volunteers that they are going to plan a class party (alternatively you can have them plan a homework assignment based on whatever you are studying). Ask them to begin discussing their plans with one caveat – they must adhere to the instructions printed on their classmates’ cards. The rest of the class observes the discussion.After a few minutes ask the students to remove their cards and sit down. Facilitate a short whole class discussion using the prompts below:–How difficult was it for the volunteers to make plans? Why?–What would have helped them make plans?–How did the roles the participants were assigned to play effect the discussion?–Does everyone need to know “the rules” before a discussion can begin?–If we had rules for this discussion such as “No Interrupting” how would the discussion have been different?–How do we make sure that people follow the rules that we set up?2. As a class read and discuss “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill” using the following questions:a. What did Harry Reid (D-NV) say about the Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN)?b. Why did Mr. Reid make such a remark?c. How does political scientist Ross Baker believe that Congress is a “mirror image of the American people”?d. What is the atmosphere described in the House and Senate?e. About what legislation were Democratic leaders “shut out” of talks?f. According to scholars who study Congress why are Americans worse for such partisan behavior?g. To what sort of procedural tactics are both parties resorting?h. Why do the “spectacles” described in the article lower the public’s opinion of Congress as an institution? How is this reflected?i. What historical examples of “unpleasantness” are cited in the article?j. How do the Jeffersonian rules attempt to keep civility in the Congress?k. Why are cross-party friendships increasingly rare?l. What steps has the House taken to address the incivility?m. Senator Olympia Snowe a moderate Republican from Maine is “deeply” concerned. What has she said about the partisanship in Congress?n. Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) are both see “hopeful signs.” Cite examples from the article that “things aren’t as bad as they seem.”o. Does Ross Baker the political scientist agree with Senators Frist and Schumer?3. After reading and discussing “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill” divide students into small groups. In their groups ask the students to reflect upon the Warm-Up exercise. In addition have students look at the existing House rules for debate and decorum ( //www.house.gov/rules/house_rules_text.htm) or Thomas Jefferson’s A Manual of Parliamentary Practice – “The Importance of Rules”( //www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm). Using their own experiences as well as the written models to guide them students examine and amend the class’s existing rules for discussion or draft their own class discussion rules. All rules should attempt to ensure civility upon enforcement. With their rules students must include a respectful method of enforcement.4. WRAP UP/HOWEWORK: Students continue to draft or amend class discussion rules. Either on a poster or in a letter to their members students then amend their class rules for the needs of Congress. Allow students to present both sets of rules in a future class.Further Questions for Discussion:–Does having rules ensure people will obey them? Why or why not–Can rules make people civil? Do they help? Explain.–How might incivility get in the way of important discussions or debate?–How do you react when others are not listening to you? How do you feel when people are being rude?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on thoughtful participation in both whole-class and small group discussions and carefully considered rules for both the class and Congress.Vocabulary:chamber civility pique amateur transcend partisanship initiatives procedural tactic filibuster inflames evicted recriminations righteous replete Pecksniff sniveling abolitionist impugn disparage censured bare-knuckles retreat centrist.Extension Activities:1. Many schools employ an honor code. What is an honor code? Does it ensure civility? Do you believe that your school should employ an honor code? Why or why not? Write an editorial for your school newspaper.2. “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill” refers to two important pieces of legislative initiatives: the Medicare prescription drug measure and the energy bill. Research one of the initiatives. In a report indicate what the measure is supposed to do the major arguments both for and against some of the “partisan compromises” in the initiative how members voted and what procedures both Republicans and Democrats used for or against passage.3. Look at “A Manual for Parliamentary Practice” by Thomas Jefferson. Imagine that you have been asked to re-write one section for today’s Congress. Using clear and concise language “translate” a section of Jefferson’s manual.4. Examine partisanship and the role that it plays in your state and municipal leadership. On a chart indicate the political affiliations of your state and municipal leadership. Find an example of an issue on which state and/or municipal leaders were divided by party. Find an example of an issue in which leaders worked across parties.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research and report upon an incident of partisan conflict in Congress. For instance you may report upon the caning of Senator Charles Sumner or the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy.Fine Arts- Look at a selection of political cartoons online [such as those at The New York Times cartoon page (www.nytimes.com/pages/cartoons/) or at Daryl Cagle’s site (//cagle.slate.msn.com/)] Draw a political cartoon that reflects the incivility in the U.S. Congress. Alternatively you may decide to interpret a cartoon about bipartisanship.Global Studies- The United States is not alone in incivility among its leaders. Research the procedures that another representative democracy uses to keep its elected officials “civil.”Media Studies- Do you think that televising debate in Congress has made it more partisan and volatile? Does conflict make for better coverage? Watch political news for a few days. Keep a journal of what you watch. At the end of week decide whether the news would have been equally as compelling (or not) if political conflicts and squabbles remained untelevised.Other Information on the Web:The Official Web site of the Library of Congress (//thomas.loc.gov/) provides access to government databases and information on congressional activity with schedules and transcripts from some of the congressional hearings.Congress.org ( //congress.org/congressorg/home/) provides details on current issues and is a place to research Congressional voting records.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8United States History Standard 8- Understands the institutions and practices of government created during the Revolution and how these elements were revised between 1787 and 1815 to create the foundation of the American political system based on the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

 0,Those who get as much of a jolt from money as they do from caffeine can find both at the new ING Direct cafe at 45 East 49th Street. Instead of bank tellers behind bulletproof glass there are baristas behind the counter in the company's bright orange cafe. The same person can show customers how to open a bank account or apply for a loan online while dispensing one of the best cups of coffee around. The coffee comes from Peet's the popular Bay Area roaster known for its dark full-bodied beans. It's $1.50 for a cup of coffee; espresso-based drinks range from $1.75 to $3.50. Open an account and the coffee is on the house. ING Direct the North American affiliate of a Dutch bank also has Internet-linked bank-cafes in Europe Australia and Canada. The branch here sells Peet's beans at $9.95 to $12.95 a pound and it's the only place you'll find them in New York City.

 9,To the Editor:''A Verdict on the Vincennes'' (editorial Aug. 4) questions the adequacy of the detection equipment aboard the cruiser Vincennes despite the Navy's opinion that there were no problems with it. This points to the real cause of the tragedy in the Persian Gulf.The Vincennes has been described as a billion-dollar ship with the world's most advanced electronic equipment. If all that this high-tech gear can do is confuse the crew and let it come to numerous false conclusions and make wrong decisions then obviously this gear is not as sophisticated as the Navy thinks it is.The purpose of the investigations and post-mortems should be to prevent recurrence of such disasters. Begin that by investigating the soundness of the Navy's equipment requirements and the contractors' degree of compliance not the crew's state of mind. HERMAN LEIBOWITZ Bayside Queens Aug. 18 1988
 0,In contrast to Syria's previous belligerent statements about the need for an immediate end to the American occupation of Iraq however Mr. Assad softened his country's position. Asked how he felt about having 100000 American soldiers as his newest neighbors he sounded almost resigned.''The problem is not whether you have one American soldier or a million American soldiers on your borders'' he said. ''And the problem is not whether they are going to stay one year or 10 years. The problem is whether the U.S. is going to become a power for achieving turbulence in the region instead of being an element of stability.''Mr. Assad acknowledged that it was up to the Iraqis to decide on the opportune moment for the United States to withdraw but said democracy could not be achieved at gunpoint. ''I think the solution in Iraq is to allow the Iraqis to write their own constitution and to elect their own government'' he said.In those remarks the Syrian president joined the unusual chorus of Arab leaders calling for measures in Iraq that often do not exist in their own countries. Although there is an official political opposition here it is largely toothless. The Baath Party and various police agencies run the country with rigorous controls against dissent and much of the economy is state controlled.Mr. Assad ruled out the deployment of Syrian troops as part of any peacekeeping force in Iraq saying that given decades of friction between the countries a Syrian contingent would probably be unacceptable to the Iraqis.The American invasion at first seemed to give Syria a case of the jitters. On the day that the United States Army brought the statue of Saddam Hussein crashing down in Baghdad Syrian television broadcast a long documentary about Islamic architecture. On the streets of Damascus at the time Syrians could be heard whispering jokes about knocking over their own statues or at least winning greater freedom.Mr. Assad conceded that some of his fellow citizens might have considered the upheaval in Iraq contagious but said any idea of Iraq as a model for change was fading beneath the grim reality of daily violence.
 0,FRIDAY PUZZLE — Well that was fun. Ori Brian is back and he offers us a Friday that experienced solvers might find fairly easy but there are enough speed bumps to slow you down a bit.Don’t race through this one. Take the time to enjoy the crunchy entries; those stacks in the northeast and southwest are great as are the long Down entries. And even the slightly shorter entries in the west and east are fun. O.K. I pretty much liked the whole thing.Tricky Clues1A: I had OPEN before BITE for “Dentist’s instruction” but TOM THUMB at 3D helped a lot.5A: Brilliant clue. “Drawing that nobody wants” had my brain working overtime. What kind of drawing could the clue be hinting at? The answer is the drawing of the SHORT STRAW. That’s hilarious.15A: “Stirs” can be a verb or a noun so which one should we pick? There is no four-letter word I can think of that describes the physical act of stirring so let’s try a noun answer. “Stirs” can also be fights or dust-ups. The answer to this clue is ADOS.
 0,Richard Perry/The New York TimesTHURSDAY’S PUZZLE — I don’t remember the last time I saw a quip theme in a New York Times puzzle mostly because Will Shortz generally doesn’t run them. Today however he makes an exception for Stu Ockman who is also making his debut. I asked Mr. Shortz why quip themes run so rarely and he responded:“Generally speaking quip themes are not as interesting as more traditional themes because they give the solver only one “Aha!” (usually at the end) whereas a traditional theme provides a little punch with each entry. Therefore for a quip or quote theme to be worth devoting an entire puzzle to the “Aha!” needs to be really big such as by being very funny or very interesting. Most quips and quotes just don’t have that big a punch. Also it’s really hard to get quips and quotes that appeal to a broad range of solvers. A quip that’s funny to one solver probably won’t be funny to someone else. I think quip and quote themes are worth running once in a while as with [Mr. Ockman’s] puzzle for variety’s sake — just not too often.”Mr. Ockman quotes the philosopher Confucius in his grid and I personally couldn’t agree more with the quote. We learn many things in life — especially from crossword puzzles am I right? — but the older we get it seems the more we realize how little we actually know. Don’t even get me started on trying to remember where I put my car keys.I was surprised to see that the nice long Down 15s — IN ALL LIKELIHOOD and BEETHOVEN’S NINTH — were not first-timers and I wasn’t partial to the partial A LET at 61 Across. I’m not even sure what a let really is in tennis and I sure didn’t like it as a partial fill-in-the-blank.All in all however this was a nice debut.Some parents in China are embracing the return of Confucian philosophy as a means of educating their children:But you knew I’d have to include this as well even though Confucius was thoughtlessly left out:Let’s meet Mr. Ockman:Constructor’s NotesIf I don’t succeed in embarrassing myself with my first puzzle (be gentle Rex) I’ll surely succeed with these constructor notes. I’m a civil engineer in real life and I’ve always found constructing things to be an enjoyable challenge. I started solving crossword puzzles in sixth grade and New York Times crosswords a year later. So when Adam Perl a longtime friend and college classmate mentioned that his crossword would be in The New York Times on Thursday (at the very end of a long phone call) I started to research crossword construction on the Web. Soon armed with a trial version of Crossword Compiler I submitted my first puzzle to Will on Christmas Day 2010. And the rest is history! In case you’re still reading that particular puzzle has never appeared in The New York Times. But I’ve learned a lot from Will’s suggestions and Adam is the best crossword mentor in upstate New York (it was Adam’s 16th New York Times crossword). Thanks Will and especially thanks Adam! I couldn’t have done it without you two. In my first dozen puzzles I tried three with what I thought were great quotes. “They have miscalculated me as a leader” a George W. Bush malapropism sadly (depending on your political point of view) did not make the cut. “I made a killing on Wall Street a few years ago. shot my broker” by Groucho Marx was rejected with a note that The New York Times almost never runs quip-themed puzzles. Finally scouring the Internet for suitable material I stumbled on the Confucius quote featured in tomorrow’s puzzle. Hope you enjoy it.Your thoughts?
 9,To the Sports Editor:I was shocked and surprised by "Steinbrenner Lashes Out at Lack of Fans in Stands" (The Times Sept. 29). If Steinbrenner spent as much time trying to please fans as he does trying to get his name in the papers there would be huge crowds at Yankee Stadium. Part of the problem is with Major League Baseball which allows Steinbrenner (against its own rules) to be an absentee owner in Tampa Fla. He's not a New Yorker. He can't even sit with fans in his home stadium because they would boo him out of his seat. If he wants to go to New Jersey fine. Just leave the Yankees behind. BILL WOLFSTHAL New York

 9,The Xoma Corporation a biotechnology company based in Berkeley Calif. said today that its chairman Steven C. Mendell had resigned to become president and chief executive of Prizm Pharmaceuticals Inc. in San Diego. Mr. Mendell will join Prizm a privately held company in mid-May.At Xoma Mr. Mendell 51 will be succeeded by John L. Castello 57 who joined the company as president and chief executive last year. Mr. Mendell who joined Xoma in 1984 previously held those titles. The company's founder Patrick J. Scannon 45 continues as vice chairman of scientific and medical affairs.Xoma shares closed today at $7.50 down 12.5 cents in Nasdaq trading. Move Was ExpectedMr. Mendell's departure had been expected since Mr. Castello joined the company. Xoma shares have been depressed since the Food and Drug Administration declined last spring to approve the company's flagship drug E-5 for the treatment of sepsis an often fatal bacterial infection. The drug showed effectiveness only in a subgroup of patients that could not be readily identified in advance.In a telephone interview Mr. Mendell said that his move was part of a plan initiated two years ago. At that time Xoma began its search for a seasoned pharmaceutical executive to manage the company as its first products approached the market.

 9,To the Editor:Re "Invite In the Rich? PEN Is Pondering" (Arts pages Jan. 24): The measures being considered are more to attract expertise than money. Like many not-for-profits we face a tightening budget. We retain foundation support and long-term support from the publishing industry.Our concern is to strengthen our programs promoting freedom of the written word literacy and literature. Hence the proposals to introduce nonmembers onto our board; they would bring breadth of experience both financial and professional and would be a resource for expanding our financial base.You portray a board deeply divided. A preliminary poll on the proposed changes indicated that 80 percent of board members favor them. We are confident we have the imagination and experience to surmount our fiscal difficulties and to bring our work forward.PAMELA MCCORDUCK Vice Pres. PEN American Center New York Jan. 29 1996
 9,So this is how it is done.It took the Jets less than three hours today to accomplish what they had done once in the last 642 days -- win a football game in the regular season.And quite a season opener it was for the team and for its new head coach Bill Parcells. In trouncing the Seahawks by 41-3 the Jets put together a quality performance they had not demonstrated since a tantalizing stretch with some outstanding teams in the mid-1980's.Indeed they had scored this many points on opening day just twice before and had never won their opening game so decisively. Quarterback Neil O'Donnell was near tears as he held a football and described for his brother and sister-in-law who had a stillborn baby last week how he was ''bringing this one home for you.''O'Donnell threw for a career-high five touchdowns -- two each to Wayne Chrebet and Jeff Graham one for good measure to Kyle Brady -- and in a commanding performance connected on 18 of 25 passes for 270 yards.

 0,Later this week a who’s who of the mergers and acquisitions world will troop down to New Orleans where Tulane University Law School will be holding its Corporate Law Institute. The event which formally starts Thursday will mark the 20th anniversary of an annual gathering that regularly draws the nation’s most prominent deal lawyers.Flipping through the brochure one is struck by just how much things have changed in the few short months since it was first distributed. But the events of the last year still loom large. Below 10 of the burning issues that I hope will be discussed later this week.1. Is it time to retire the Williams Act? The Williams Act is 40 years old this year and many of its provisions governing tender offers are outdated set up for a time before the poison pill when companies lacked takeover defenses. For example given the existence of a poison pill and a target’s ability to cap a bidder’s acquisitions of shares is it even necessary to retain the all-holders/best price rule?2. Conversely when will the Securities and Exchange Commission get back in the takeover regulation business? The S.E.C. has been a relatively quiescent regulator of takeovers since its heyday in the 1980s apparently content to let Delaware be the king. The last real substantive S.E.C. review of merger regulation was back in 1983. (Marty Lipton was on that panel also.) This has left us with a federal takeover code that is outdated — see point 1 — and sometimes makes little sense. For example is there any reason to not put mergers and tender offers on full parity? And why is it that the Delaware courts now appear to be the primary regulators of fairness opinion disclosure? It would be nice if the S.E.C. could at least fix these issues and harmonize its regulation with the last twenty years of Delaware’s decisions.3. Are special-purpose acquisition companies a boon — or the next calamity waiting to happen? In particular — and since this is a takeover conference — I’m interested in the issues that are likely to arise in the coming wave of SPAC takeovers. Will significant SPAC shareholders attempt to hold up acquisitions and extort additional consideration by their ability to vote no on acquisitions and force a liquidation of the vehicle? What happens when the trading price of a SPAC is actually below the liquidation value in such circumstances? And who is still buying these things anyway?4.What is the likely future structure of private equity transactions? Are we going to see a continued wholesale shift to single-tier reverse termination fee deals with no possibility of specific performance? This appears to be the trend right now but what will happen once the market perks up again and strategic bidders compete for deals? In this regard it would be nice to get some comment from the Delaware judges on what they think about the availability of specific performance in a cash deal under Delaware law in the face of party language to that effect.5. When will the S.E.C. finally reform its cross-border rules? Eight years after their promulgation the S.E.C. exemptions for cross-border transactions are still unworkable.6. What should we do about sovereign wealth funds? This was the hot-button issue three issues back before Bear Stearns; the Clear Channel litigation and its implications for bank-sponsor lending relationships; and the possible restructuring of the financial regulatory framework. But the question remains: Is more regulation of sovereign wealth funds a necessity or an economic burden? And does Treasury’s recent one-page voluntary statement of principles with Dubai and Singapore on these funds mean anything at all? The background issue here is whether the national security review process is currently effective and not overburdensome in light of inter alia CFIUS’s blocking of the 3Com transaction. Or perhaps it is not strict enough and should apply to noncontrolling transactions such as the recent slew of investment bank sovereign wealth investments.7. Are hedge funds the future of mergers? As hedge funds become increasingly activist investors how will they affect the structuring and completion of takeovers? Are the cries of short-termism correct — or even relevant?8. Do we need to rethink the terms of debt financing arrangements? Given the blow-up in the Clear Channel litigation should sponsors and other borrowers firm up terms in financing commitment letters and fill the uncertainty over what the “customary” language requirement means?

 0,An international gathering of Christian counselors here is undertaking an ambitious idea: reduce divorce among church members by training 100000 married couples over the next five years to be ''marriage mentors'' for people getting married or working to keep their marriages going.The idea written as a brief statement called ''Commitment to Building Healthy Marriages'' has been printed on a poster and mounted on an easel so it can be endorsed by those attending the meeting of the American Association of Christian Counselors. Among the first to sign was the Rev. Jerry Falwell whose Liberty University has just begun a doctoral program in pastoral and professional counseling.''It is clear that the breakdown of the family -- 50 percent-plus divorce rate -- bleeds over into the Christian community'' Mr. Falwell said in an interview.Indeed a recent survey by the Barna Research Group a market research firm in Ventura Calif. found that born-again Christians were about as likely to divorce as other Americans. Lately too news articles have reported that divorce rates in some Bible Belt states are the nation's highest.

 0,What is the moral justification “for you to play what is essentially a game of Russian roulette” with someone’s life? It’s a brutal question posed by a journalist against the breathtaking backdrop of Mount Everest. It’s also one that nags at you throughout “Sherpa” an exceptionally absorbing documentary.Jennifer Peedom the director and her team went to Nepal in 2014 to document the climbing season and observe the Sherpa leader Phurba Tashi who was to hike to the summit of Mount Everest for a record 22nd time. While they were on the mountain a gigantic ice block crashed onto one of the routes killing 16 Sherpas.Several days later foreign climbers (who pay upward of $100000 each) wanted to continue their trek. Many Sherpas demanded that the season be canceled to honor the dead. That dispute lies at the heart of the film.Sherpas (though that name is synonymous with mountain guides it denotes their ethnic group) have long been viewed as smiling servants. Yet in recent years they’ve become more educated and aware of the meager rewards they receive for taking immense risks.

 0,Aired Friday night on NBC: Happy Leap Year! This is February 29th. How about that? In fact when President Bush heard that he said “Remember turn your clocks ahead one year everybody.”In a press conference today President Bushannounced America is not headed into a recession especially if you own an oil company.High gas prices leave a bad taste in people’s mouths. Have you noticed that? That’s mostly from the siphoning but still it’s a horror.In fact gas is so expensive in LA now when you call 911 they ask you to meet the ambulance halfway.Yesterday President Bush said that last year an intelligence gap opened up. Last year? Gee didn’t that open up about 2001 right after the inauguration?Just 48 hours after Homeland Security officials told Congress a 28-mile long virtual fence along the U.S.-Mexican border was working they now say it will be delayed three years because they can’t get the video surveillance to work. Isn’t that amazing? Do you realize Homeland Security has less video surveillance than the New England Patriots.And in movie news the movie “Panic Room 2″ is now in development. The whole thing’s going to be filmed at Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters.And more problems with John McCain. The New York Times is now saying there is a question as to whether McCain is eligible to become president because he was born in Panama. See his parents were in the military so he was born in Panama. In fact the reason they moved away from Panama the building of the canal was keeping the young John McCain up.Now I don’t want to say McCain is old but yesterday he accidentally got on the wrong bus ended up taking a gambling junket to Atlantic City.See everyone is so concerned now where all the candidates were born. You know McCain was born on a military base in Panama Hillary was born outside Chicago and if you believe the media Barack Obama was born in a manger.

 9,''There were a number of obstacles that were deliberately placed in our path by the Government'' he said.''We have clear evidence that Government agents intimidated the population in the sense of going out and warning people not to talk to us systematically interrogating people who did talk to us and in some cases making direct threats to people who they knew had given information to us.''Demonstrations were organized against us in various cities including the capital. In some case we have direct evidence of Government involvement in what they referred to as spontaneous demonstrations.''The team met the most serious protests in Mbandaka a town in western Congo where refugees had fled to escape pursuers from the east. Mr. Brody was one of those threatened.''We had interviewed priests who were eyewitnesses to the massacre of innocent civilians in Mbandaka'' he said today. ''The reason the Government was always trying to keep us away from Mbandaka is that most of the other incidents occurred far away out in the middle of the jungle. The only witnesses were the refugees themselves who then scattered to the four winds.''In Mbandaka you had Rwandese and Congolese troops massacring people in front of the populace. There are hundreds of potential eyewitnesses.''The investigation was ill-fated from its inception more than a year ago when the United Nations Human Rights Commission asked its special monitor for what was then Zaire Roberto Garreton of Chile to look into charges that massacres had taken place during Mr. Kabila's military advance late in 1996 on the Government of Mobutu Sese Seko.

 0,PhotoAdministrivial Will Shortz Sighting! Sorry for the short notice but Will Shortz will be interviewed at 3:30 p.m. Eastern today on MSNBC about competitive crossword solving because there’s not enough competition going on in sports today.SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — An unusual looking mirror-symmetry grid isn’t it? It turns out there are reasons for that and when the hurly-burly’s done hopefully you will see all the great things in this puzzle too.I was very excited when I cracked this grid. I recently went to see the actor Alan Cumming in a nearly one-man performance of “THE SCOTTISH PLAY” (Ssshh … don’t say “MACBETH” if you’re backstage at a performance of Shakespeare’s tragedy. It’s bad luck.) and was bowled over by his ability to play almost all the parts by himself. Not only that but this adaptation of the play placed him in the psych ward of a hospital after having been brought in by the police for having committed a brutal crime. Very haunting!Speaking of haunting how about that weapon in the middle of this puzzle by Dick Shlakman (who appears to be making his debut) and Jeff Chen? You didn’t miss it did you? Take your writing implement of choice and connect the circled letters which just happen to spell out MACBETH (ssshh!).Ah there is a dagger you see before you the handle toward your hand. Worry not that there appears to be BLOOD dripping from it at 100 Down. If you’d like to see the answer key that was made specially for this puzzle you can click here to see it in all its gory I mean glory.And take a moment to enjoy the really delicious entries some having to do with the play some not. I loved MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS KNOCK KNOCK WHO’S THERE DURAN DURAN ONE FELL SWOOP A CHARMED LIFE WHAT’S DONE IS DONE BANDOLERO TOODLE-OO KAHUNA and of course THE SCOTTISH PLAY.I get the feeling although I can’t confirm it that the cluing was made a bit easier today but I’m not sure why that would be since the trick to the puzzle is mainly visual. It doesn’t really matter; it’s a lovely puzzle with great fill and I smiled all the way through it.Let’s hear from Mr. Shlakman and Mr. Chen:Constructor NotesJ.C.: Thus continues the saga of “JEFF VS. DAN on Jeff’s own puzzles.” My solving time: 6:39. You’ll find Dan’s time (and that of the other speedsters posted at Dan’s blog. Curious to see how badly he beat me this time. It’s been over 30 puzzles now and I still haven’t won. Heck sometimes I don’t even come within a factor of two! Very fun collaborating with Dick on his big debut. He came up with the idea and I helped him refine it. I actually didn’t do that much. The credit should go to him. It’s tough to come up with clever ideas for a New York Times Sunday puzzle. Ah the gridwork. Not as much of a challenge as I’ve encountered in some other constructions but a toughie nonetheless. There are only six themers but incorporating the dagger with the MACBETH letters made it tricky forcing us to deploy our black squares quicker than we had desired. This left big open spaces in the NW and NE and without those cheater squares (the two stair patterns at the top of the grid) it looked pretty hopeless. We debated whether EXERCISERS was legitimate eventually deciding it was KOSHER and were glad that it allowed the snazzy BANDOLERO and LITERATI to work. The other tricky spot sort of sneaked up on us. Because of the word count limitations (140 max) we had to incorporate a few long across answers IONE SKYE notably. It’s a nice entry in itself but boy did it cause problems. Because it crossed three theme answers there weren’t many options there besides IONE SKYE and once that was fixed into place KIEL was the best we could do at that spot. Now I’m a huge fan of James Bond villains and Jaws in particular but even I don’t like having to remember who played him. And having OHO OOH OH I UH OH … that’s my fault. Sometimes at a certain point (in this case maybe 50 attempts) you’ve done your best. Ah well as with most constructions there will be compromises. I had a great time working on this with Dick and I welcome anyone who’s interested in collaborating (Read: allowing me to ride on your coattails as I politely shoot down all your ideas until something fun emerges) to contact me at jeffchen1972 (at) gmail.com. D.S.: If the byline for co-constructors was set in type reflecting the respective contributions of each my name would be in 8-point pica type and Jeff’s in 20-point BOLDED and italicized. I am very different from most who construct puzzles accepted by The New York Times. At age 74 words and wordplay continue to delight me but trivia does not for I will forget it 5 minutes after I learn it. I have already forgotten every movie star and character name in Star Wars never saw a Hobbit movie and know not of any pop music title performer or album after the 1960s; I have often argued there was no pop music after the 60s. I do not attempt any crosswords or other puzzles except the Sunday New York Times and it takes me close to an entire day to get near finishing one. When I discover the theme and theme words and other fun fill that is not a proper noun I consider the puzzle successfully solved. Notwithstanding this lack of both crossword completion skill and practice it has been a dream (or a bucket list item) to see my name attached to a Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle. (I think it is the same syndrome that causes me to enjoy writing poetry but not reading it.) I had many theme ideas (none architectural) and no ability whatsoever to take the next step. One Sunday in checking my many unfilled answers at Rex Parker’s blog I saw a comment from Jeff volunteering to work with “noobies”. My initial response was to send Jeff an idea for a puzzle involving homophones and a lengthy list of potential theme answers. That effort ultimately led to the co-construction of a puzzle containing homophones as the theme answers submitted to and accepted by Will for a Wednesday publication but it has not yet been published. (Would that constitute foreplay if this is my maiden appearance?) During the course of working with that puzzle Jeff taught me the most basic of New York Times crossword construction requirements to wit: that theme answers need to be internally very consistent and “tight” (a comment I have heard from Jeff as he has with considerable grace declined to co-author virtually every other idea I have submitted to him!) and that the fill must be neat and clean and interesting with as little reliance on “crosswordese” as possible. My original idea and theme word selections for this puzzle centered on well-known expressions first introduced into the English language by Shakespeare. Not “tight enough” opined my new mentor. He suggested we try for such theme content from one play only. He also authored the idea of using Macbeth and working in as the reveal clue the reference to the superstition against mentioning the play’s name (which was the subject of a marvelous Canadian television series called “Slings and Arrows” season 2 also shown in the U.S. on Sundance). In our division of labor we collaborated and contributed equally on the selection of the Macbeth quotes Jeff did the grid and virtually all of the fill and I took the lead in and supplied much of the clues. Will of course had much to say about the clues. (I am reminded of Justice Jackson’s aphorism about the Supreme Court: “We are not final because we are infallible but we are infallible only because we are final.”) Jeff and I are curious about whether the extent of the clue-editing is average or more or less than average. Perhaps Will will enlighten us.And when we all meet again in thunder lightning or in rain it will be time for the Monday puzzle.Here’s a clip of Alan Cumming in The National Shakespeare Company’s presentation of … well you know:Your thoughts?

 9,The divided people of Korea have good reason to celebrate the old year along with the new. The withdrawal of all U.S. nuclear arms from South Korea made the peninsula nuclear-free. Now a potentially far-reaching agreement between the Governments of the South and the North could keep it that way.Yesterday's accord reaffirms the commitment of the two Governments undertaken in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty not to acquire nuclear arms. And it goes two critical steps further: It commits North Korea not to construct facilities for reprocessing nuclear material and it opens the way to on-site inspection by the South of a suspect facility in the North.The agreement thus provides a script for defusing nuclear fears on the peninsula. One: Washington assures Pyongyang that it has indeed withdrawn all nuclear arms from the peninsula and resumes pulling out troops. Two: Pyongyang signs the safeguards accord that allows access by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Three: Seoul calls off Team Spirit the joint military exercises it conducts annually with the U.S.And then most important of all Pyongyang faithfully implements the key provisions of yesterday's accord by accepting inspection of its suspected reprocessing plant at Yongbyon -- and if necessary by halting construction. These steps will speed the reconciliation of North and South help create ties between the U.S. and North Korea and assure a peaceful new year for all Koreans.

 9,Big-time college sports recruiters have long found a rich source of talent in community colleges. Now after a decade of decline in black enrollment and graduation rates academic recruiters at four-year schools are finding that community colleges may also be a source of academic talent. It's a trend that deserves encouragement; creditably the Ford Foundation is offering some.The foundation last week announced a $1.2 million grant to help 25 urban community colleges and an equal number of four-year institutions develop partnerships to guide black and other minority group students through the transfer process and to bachelor's degrees.In 1986 according to the American Council on Education 43 percent of all black students in higher education were in two-year schools. By comparison only 36 percent of whites were. If it were not for the existence of historically black four-year colleges the proportion of blacks in two-year institutions would undoubtedly have been higher.In one sense this heavy minority presence in community colleges is good. It indicates the schools are what they were intended to be: providers of a cheap easily accessible foothold on a college degree.

 0,WASHINGTON — A cinco meses de la cumbre de la ONU donde se buscará forjar un acuerdo histórico para reducir las emisiones que causan el calentamiento climático se empiezan a vislumbrar señales significativas de progreso.China el mayor productor de gases de efecto invernadero en el mundo presentó un plan de 16 páginas ante las Naciones Unidas el 30 de junio en el cual detalla cómo planea cambiar su economía para reducir las emisiones de combustibles fósiles para el 2030. El mismo día Dilma Rousseff presidenta de Brasil país que está entre los 10 principales emisores de carbono y el Presidente Obama anunciaron en Washington que sus naciones habían acordado ampliar drásticamente la generación de electricidad con fuentes renovables.Pero cada vez es más evidente que las acciones por parte de estos y otros países no serán suficientes para evitar un aumento de la temperatura atmosférica de 2 grados Celsius o 36 grados Fahrenheit. Cuando se llegue a ese momento dicen los científicos el planeta estará condenado a un futuro de tormentas extremas sequías escasez de alimentos y agua y aumentos en el nivel del mar.Según lo acordado en la cumbre climática de las Naciones Unidas en Perú el pasado diciembre cada país debe presentar un plan para reducir las emisiones de carbono antes de la cumbre de diciembre en París. Los planes de las naciones formarán el núcleo del nuevo acuerdo.Corea del Sur Serbia e Islandia también presentaron sus planes para reducir las emisiones recientemente uniéndose a los 40 o más países que ya lo habían hecho incluyendo Canadá México Rusia Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea.En un anuncio conjunto por Brasil y los Estados Unidos los dos países se comprometieron a incrementar el uso de energía eólica solar y geotérmica para que represente el 20 por ciento de la producción eléctrica de cada país en 2030 lo que duplicaría la generación de energía a partir de fuentes renovables en Brasil y la triplicaría en Estados Unidos. Brasil también se comprometió a recuperar unos 30 millones de acres de selva amazónica un área aproximadamente del tamaño de Honduras.“Después del progreso alcanzado durante mis viajes a China y la India queda demostrado que las principales economías del mundo pueden comenzar a trascender algunas de las viejas divisiones y trabajar conjuntamente para enfrentar el desafío común algo en lo que tenemos que trabajar para nuestras generaciones futuras” dijo Obama quien ha impulsado a otros países a firmar un acuerdo sobre el cambio climático.Los expertos en política climática destacaron la importancia del plan de China. Estados Unidos y China los principales emisores de gases de efecto invernadero del mundo siempre han sido considerados como los mayores obstáculos para llegar a un acuerdo global significativo. Eso cambió en noviembre pasado cuando Obama y el Presidente Xi Jinping anunciaron conjuntamente que Estados Unidos reduciría sus emisiones hasta en un 28 por ciento desde los niveles de 2005 para el año 2025 mientras que las emisiones de China podrían alcanzar su punto máximo y luego declinar a más tardar en 2030.En marzo Obama presentó un plan ante las Naciones Unidas que detalla cómo Estados Unidos alcanzarán su objetivo. El plan dice que lo harían principalmente a través de la promulgación de regulaciones de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental sobre las emisiones de automóviles camiones y plantas eléctricas.El plan de China incluye un amplio compromiso para desligar el crecimiento económico del uso de los combustibles fósiles y un movimiento para reducir su intensidad de carbono (la cantidad del contaminante generado por cada punto de crecimiento económico) en un 60 o 65 por ciento respecto a los niveles de 2005 para el año 2030. Asimismo expuso los planes para desarrollar un sistema nacional de topes y comercio un programa en el que las empresas deben pagar permisos para contaminar y pueden comprar y vender dichos permisos entre sí.Brasil a pesar de su reciente anuncio aún no ha presentado su plan climático a las Naciones Unidas al igual que otras economías importantes como la India y Japón. En todo caso los expertos dicen que lo más probable es que sus planes no serán lo suficientemente robustos para frenar los efectos nocivos del cambio climático.Negociadores de las Naciones Unidas dicen que ahora ven el acuerdo de París como el primer paso en un proceso de varios años en que los países impulsarán políticas climáticas nacionales y se reunirán regularmente para lograr planes más estrictos.

 0,Lady Gaga did not so much arrive at the Venice Film Festival this August as she floated into it a platinum Aphrodite borne on the waves black stilettos skimming the sea foam. Which is to say she took a water taxi.An image of her zooming across the canal — perched precariously on the side of the lacquered motorboat in a little black dress her legs elegantly entwined her hair shaped into three victory rolls like a crown of croissants holding a single red rose in one hand and blowing kisses with the other — immediately became a meme. Of course she couldn’t just walk up to the premiere of “A Star Is Born” the first feature film in which she has a leading role playing the titular supernova. Walking is for rubes. Sailing on the other hand is timeless. It is an activity for sirens of both the mythological and screen persuasions. It is also joyfully unapologetically hammy: high camp on the high seas a playful pastiche of all the celebrity cruisers who came before. In mere hours several internet sleuths began to post pictures of Gaga on the boat along with photos of classic Hollywood stars including Marilyn Monroe in a one-piece black bathing suit. The next day Gaga and Bradley Cooper her director and co-star arrived hand in hand to a screening; she was wearing a swingy white dress the kind made for walking over subway grates. The wink was complete.We could have seen this coming. Lady Gaga is our pop laureate of the grand entrance our patron saint of operatic ingress. She has never in a decade of global fame been content to simply appear in a room; she has to plummet into it shimmying down a cable like a diamond-encrusted spider. Or she hobbles in a fembot on fake crutches a high-fashion Tiny Tim. Before performing at the 2011 Grammys she claimed to have slept in an oversize translucent egg for 72 hours so that when she finally emerged she could feel that she had experienced total “creative embryonic incubation.” For the first decade of her career she was often at least seminude when descending every staircase. In her younger more tenderized years she trotted into the MTV Video Music Awards in a now-infamous gown and snow boots made of raw beef not just a sight gag but a full-on olfactory happening abattoir fabulous. Gaga once described herself as “a show with no intermission” but it might be more accurate to view her career as a glorious series of overtures; her curtain is always rising. This is why her water ride in Venice elicited such collective delight in the form of vigorous retweeting. She may now be a serious actress but she hasn’t lost her sense of play.When I met Lady Gaga on a hazy afternoon a few days after her Venice tour at her house so high up in the Hollywood Hills that I broke through the fog line before I reached it she was still in full Marilyn mode. Her duckling-blond hair was molded into a halo around her face. Her lips were matte red slightly overdrawn an enthusiastic valentine. She was wearing the same towering patent-leather stilettos from the boat and a brown tiger-print wiggle dress a midcentury silhouette favored by celluloid bombshells that vacuum-seals the calves into place. Her earrings obsidian chandelier dangles heavy as hood ornaments cast prismatic shadows on her clavicle and seemed to threaten the general integrity of her otherwise regal posture.Having seen “A Star Is Born” the day before in which Gaga gives a notably stripped down unbleached performance I was slightly jarred as I watched her shuffle through her house (which also happened to have been the house of the avant-garde rocker Frank Zappa before she bought it from his family trust in 2016) in a full face and spike heels. In the film her character Ally starts off makeup-free a frustrated waitress with mud-puddle hair (Gaga’s natural hue) who long ago abandoned her songwriting dreams and has settled for crooning live covers one night a week at a drag bar the only woman on the bill. One night Bradley Cooper as the shambling alcoholic rock star Jackson Maine stumbles into the bar looking for a nightcap and instead discovers a muse — he is bewitched by her performance of “La Vie en Rose” in an Edith Piaf costume complete with thin eyebrows fashioned from electrical tape.[Read our review of “A Star Is Born.”]Later that night Jackson asks Ally why she doesn’t pursue a music career. She tells him that she tried she really did. She just couldn’t find any industry types who could get past her face. They loved the way she sounded hated the way she looked. Hearing this Jackson reaches out with a single finger and traces the contours of her nose. While this is on its own an erotic gesture it is Ally’s reaction that makes the scene: She just breathes as he gently outlines the organ she feels worst about. It’s an arresting moment in which she seems both receptive and completely assured.Now as we toured her house Gaga was as opaque as Ally is transparent. She spoke carefully in a breathy tone as if she were in an active séance with an old movie star whose press agent advised her to remain enigmatic and demure. She showed me a bizarre bathroom where she had found a bed over the shower; she gestured delicately at her backyard announcing: “Some beautiful lemon trees. It’s a nice place to come and just create.” When we got into the studio she tiptoed through the cavernous live room pointing out a grand piano in a voice so quiet I could barely hear her. We made our way to a small alcove with whitewashed walls and 20-foot ceilings which looked like the storage room of an art museum — an echo chamber she explained. I asked about the acoustics in part because it seemed the polite thing to do but in part because I was trying to open any conversational tap I could find. Whether she was feeling legitimately shy or was simply method-acting as a restrained ingénue she had yet to speak at full volume.Suddenly she broke into song. A cappella unprompted voce forte her arms flung out to full wingspan her head tossed back to bare her throat. She was singing the chorus of “Shallow” the song she co-wrote for “A Star Is Born” that has become the de facto theme song for the movie. It is sung at the cathartic apex of the trailer (which has been viewed almost 10 million times on YouTube) — the moment when Ally reluctantly steps onto an arena stage for the first time to sing with Jackson. Gaga plays this moment with incredible restraint; it’s hard to imagine her not wanting to storm a stage but she really sells it. Ally has been down for so long that she hesitates not fully believing that this is her shot. But then something shifts. She straightens her shoulders struts out to the microphone and sends her voice soaring over the crowd.In the echo chamber the words of the song ricocheted shaking the room: “I’m off the deep end! Watch as I dive in! I’ll never meet the ground!” When Gaga sings her whole body vibrates. She clenches her fists squeezes her eyes shut.She may now be a serious actress but she hasn’t lost her sense of play. Marilyn Minter for The New York TimesAfter she finished belting Gaga looked beatific almost giddy having answered my banal question with undeniable certainty. The acoustics in here we agreed were very good.The title of “A Star Is Born” is misleading and always has been. It implies spontaneous generation Athena popping fully formed out of Zeus’ forehead. In reality it is a story about hard work about the grueling machinations behind celebrity. In each version of the film fame can destroy (by enabling addiction or worsening self-destructive behaviors) but it can also be a sacred rite; it anoints the truly worthy with laurels and fragrant oils no matter how aquiline her nose. The narrative takes a nobody and brings her together with a fading legend. He falls in love with her and her artistic potential and thrusts her straight into the crucible of mass popularity. It is a love story as unshakably perennial as “Romeo and Juliet” except slightly less crushing because only the man is doomed and the leading lady gets to walk away from her tragedy triumphant her suffering noble her name in neon lights.“A Star Is Born” has never really been a film about an unknown actress shooting across the screen like a rare comet. Instead from the very beginning it has always been a film about an already superfamous woman shooting a movie. That’s the real reason the franchise works: It comes with a built-in insurance policy. In 1937 when Janet Gaynor stepped into the role of the farm girl Esther Blodgett in the first version (which was itself a remix of a 1932 drama called “What Price Hollywood?”) she was making a comeback but she had been a box-office titan of the silent era the first woman to ever win an Academy Award for acting. Judy Garland who tackled Esther in 1954 (a studio executive quickly changes her name to Vicki Lester in the film) was a household name at 17 no longer a vaudevillian striver but a minted studio girl kept on a steady infusion of amphetamines and barbiturates and praise. In 1976 Barbra Streisand whose character’s name was Esther Hoffman (we have to believe she goes from mieskeit to swan) was already an Oscar winner for playing Fanny Brice and fresh off another nomination for “The Way We Were.” These actresses were all at least a decade into their careers and they used the material less as a coming-out party and more as a victory lap. Of course the Esthers would succeed; their real-life counterparts had already pushed through every obstacle.This is why the lead role is so alluring to divas who want to explore the boundaries of their fame and what they had to endure to lasso it. These actresses in drag as younger versions of themselves get to wrestle with their flaws and air out their darkest fears. But we don’t fear for them not really because we know how the story turns out. Garland who always felt so intimidated by the leggy army of MGM blondes that she spent her life making self-deprecating jokes fashioned herself into the world’s most beloved brunette. Streisand whose line “Hello gorgeous” was soaking in wry irony turned a prominent bridge into a locus of desire.Gaga’s innate New York City toughness brings a different flavor to the role than her predecessors. Where Janet Gaynor plays the starlet as pure and cornfed Garland plays her as a plucky troubadour in pert ribbon bow ties and Streisand plays her as a wisecracking prima donna in colorful ponchos (hey it was the ’70s) Gaga’s Ally is more world-weary and knowing. She is the kind of woman who gets into fistfights who alternately sasses and fusses over her father (Andrew Dice Clay) a chauffeur who once had showbiz aspirations himself but never had a lucky break. When Cooper offered Gaga the role he told her that “this is what it would be like if you were 31 and had never made it” and she readily embodies the ferocious hunger of the would-be famous. She’s no innocent when she walks onstage to sing. She knows exactly what to do and exactly what this will mean for her career. She’s ready to go.Ally’s journey is not about a singer developing her talent — that’s already there. It is about finding her way toward an aesthetic once she has the world’s attention. She dyes her hair Tang orange begins working with a choreographer and sings springy pop songs about butts all of which she does without wavering even when Jackson drunkenly criticizes her for being inauthentic. Some viewers may read a rock-versus-pop hierarchy into Ally’s transformations — that she is more “real” when she is harmonizing with Jackson’s twangy melodies or sitting at her piano — but Gaga’s onscreen mastery over both genres is a pre-emptive rebuttal to what is essentially a gendered bias. What “A Star Is Born” makes clear about Lady Gaga is that she possesses the dexterity to make whatever kind of music she likes.Cooper told me that he cast Gaga after seeing her perform “La Vie en Rose” at a cancer benefit. The very next day he drove to her Malibu home to test their chemistry. They bonded right away about their families (both East Coast both Italian) and ate spaghetti on her porch. “She was completely illuminated by the sun” he said. “So charismatic. I thought inside my head Oh gosh. If she is like this on film if that’s the worst case scenario that she’s this present on film the movie will work.”It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when Lady Gaga the international superstar was born. Past a certain level of fame the origin stories of pop artists begin to tilt into the mythological. “I have a nerve inside of me to do this” Gaga said sitting on a swivel chair in her basement studio when I asked what drives her. She kept her legs crossed at the ankles and her spine rod-straight with her shell-pink nails gingerly intertwined in her lap as if she were practicing to meet Queen Elizabeth (side note: When Gaga did meet the queen after performing in the Royal Variety Show in 2009 she curtsied while wearing a floor-length puff-sleeved dress made entirely of slick red latex). “And I have no idea where it comes from except that it might come from God. No one knows.”What she does know is that at some point she felt free: to drop her birth name (Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta) to turn herself into an event to keep shedding old skins.She insists the performance is the reality. Marilyn Minter for The New York TimesLady Gaga’s early career was a study in this invitational freedom: Look how free I am look how free you could be. This is what she was selling at 21 with her platinum oversize hairbows and gigantic sunglasses and skyscraper shoulder pads. This is the realization that led her after growing up on the Upper West Side attending a private Catholic girls’ school and studying piano minuets to move downtown in 2004 first to study theater arts at N.Y.U. (she dropped out during sophomore year) and then to sing in grungy bars on the Lower East Side while she sent her demos to record labels. She read Andy Warhol’s books and realized that what most people want when they dream of fame is not necessarily wealth or power but limitlessness: the ability to change. So many artists start out gritty and homegrown but calcify into hardened personae over time; when Lady Gaga adopted her new name (sometime around 2006 most likely from a Queen song) she decided to flip the formula. What if she began with the character and the character was the physical embodiment of flux? What if she never wore the same outfit twice or gave an interview out of costume or claimed to be a paragon of creative authenticity?Gaga’s debut album “The Fame” (quickly reissued with extra songs as “The Fame Monster”) came out in August 2008 a season of optimism and political overhaul when young people were ready to accept jangly pop hooks from a chimerical sprite who told them they could continually redefine themselves. Her first recordings may not have been too deep — “Poker Face” still her second-biggest single to date after “Just Dance” is an ode to mirrored surfaces to remaining willfully inscrutable — but they were catchy (she changed the way an entire generation hears the phrase “ooh la la”) and their agile lightness was intentional. Much of her early music was thumping and linear: big synths big hooks the beats clinking together like a wristful of silver bangles. The music was a tool for propagating her radiant image which was continually surprising to behold.When Gaga first emerged onto the pop scene she was a phenomenon — a kooky amalgam of New York club-kid toughness art-school experimentation record-label grooming classical vocal training and bona fide radio hits. She clearly took her cues from previous incarnations of major pop stardom (David Bowie’s amphibious glam Madonna’s blond ambition Michael Jackson’s dual love of sparkles and precision) but she was even more focused than her predecessors on the live event on the coup de théâtre. She started pushing boundaries and stopped wearing pants; she became a walking billboard for avant-garde fashion (Alexander McQueen’s ankle-bending hoof heels a jacket covered in felt Kermit the Frogs several gowns made of human hair that meat dress) a fact that served to make every other artist at the time who wasn’t rolling around onstage in a pool of fake blood seem frankly dull.Gaga’s initial obsession with masquerade predicted the double lives we all live now our simultaneous existences as living breathing people and disembodied avatars. But instead of seeing those identities as segmented — the real person the facade — she put forth the concept that it’s possible and ultimately adaptive in a fractured world to try to free yourself from old boundaries. You can be an insider and an outsider at the same time a human and an alien. All that is solid melts into Gaga. If this seems paradoxical it is; but the paradox is where Gaga shines. Postmodern double truths are her milieu.She started calling herself a monster not just to embrace a kind of outré bizarreness that had mainly been the province of male pop icons like Bowie or Prince but also because she was monstrous a pop creation that devoured the zeitgeist and then gleefully regurgitated it. She mock-hanged herself with a noose onstage she dreamed up a hat filled with live cockroaches she sucked on a rosary in the “Alejandro” video she hired a “vomit artist” to spew lime-green milk on her outfit at South by Southwest she delivered an awards-show speech as her male alter-ego Jo Calderone. Her whole project was a Technicolor dream ballet a gauzy hallucination. And it sold records (over 27 million worldwide) and won awards (six Grammys).“I do keep transforming into a new shell of me” she told me. “So sure there is an acting component to what I do or a showbiz component to what I do. But the word ‘acting’ it’s hard for me to talk about in that way because ‘acting’ to me almost implies faking it.” She insisted to me that all her iterations form an unbroken line that the performance is the reality.Gaga has over the last decade arguably moved the entire pop apparatus toward forceful weirdness. Her influence is everywhere — she opened the doors for more female hitmakers to be cheekily bizarre (Miley Cyrus grinding on a wrecking ball Katy Perry with her sniper-rifle bra filled with whipped cream Sia living under her wig even St. Vincent’s indie Fritz Lang affect) — but as a result Gaga’s early maximalism began to feel less vital to the cultural conversation. In 2011 Adele’s “21” cemented a new austerity in pop; all she had to do to sell 11 million records was stand in one place and sing plaintively about heartbreak.So Gaga swerved again and again and again. She made a jazz record with Tony Bennett. She made a crunchier heavy-metallish album called “Artpop” that mostly failed to connect with the public at least on the large Gagagian scale she was used to (it sold fewer than a million copies). When she turned 30 she released a more minimalist fifth record called “Joanne” after an aunt who died young of complications from lupus. She promoted the album in ripped T-shirts and a plain pink felt hat. She toured dive bars before the arenas. She also released the Netflix documentary “Gaga: Five Foot Two” a vérité glimpse into her daily life as she prepped for the 2017 Super Bowl produced and promoted “Joanne” and spoke openly about the debilitating pain caused by her fibromyalgia (something she had been dealing with privately for years). The documentary presents Gaga with a striking lack of vanity. She appears on camera with dirty hair and a bare face. This is Gaga the Vulnerable Gaga the Sensitive Soul.That film ends with her performance at the Super Bowl where she sang all the karaoke staples of her back catalog — “Bad Romance” “Telephone” even “Just Dance” — with gusto in a sequined bodysuit thrusting through the jangly disco beats of “Born This Way” in high-heel boots surrounded by an army of dancers in iridescent capes. It was a blistering set a Greatest Hits Cardio Workout and a truly impressive display of her cultural dominance. But it also felt elegiac as if it belonged to a different era when Gaga was giving stump speeches about overturning “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” and the song became an anthem of the fight for gay marriage on a national scale. In recent years queer culture has become more anti-institutional less about normalizing and more about resisting norms. In a way Gaga’s galactic fame which once gave her such a huge platform as an advocate for equality became a liability when the conversation became more intimate and nuanced. Pop is not entirely post-spectacle (Beyoncé’s recent Coachella performance was a multiact extravaganza) but it is evolving into a less bombastic space. It is getting more raw smaller. And Gaga is doing the same.Two artists explore the idea of transformation. Video by Marilyn MinterShe has not given up on the power of an audacious live show (this winter she will put on a pyrotechnic Las Vegas residency called “Enigma”) but in making “A Star Is Born” she is entering into a softer conversation with the public — about talent about ambition about her own trajectory. Ally is the most human of all of Gaga’s creations and offering her to us — her fear her loyalty her shattered heart after tragedy — is a different kind of gamble than stepping out in front of millions dressed like a holographic Muppet. She is in essence making exploratory autofiction on a grand scale even as she is playing yet another character.Lady Gaga bought Frank Zappa’s eccentric woodland estate not as a place to live while in Los Angeles — she already has a Mediterranean-style villa on an isolated craggy cliffside in Malibu for that — but as a work retreat the new nerve center of her countless creative pursuits. She wants to paint here write music here (she told me that currently she is feverishly writing songs on a white piano upstairs; literally on the surface of the piano with a black Sharpie) and plan her Vegas spectacular from here with her production team like a war council plotting some dazzling siege. In her recording studio after her “Shallows” serenade Gaga played me five tracks from the coming film soundtrack. As the music blasted she began to loosen up — this was her turf her major contribution to the film. She lip-synced to her own songs from her swivel chair looking straight into my eyes and drawing me insistently into her joy.The studio is her sanctuary and one of the main reasons she felt she had to have the property. She is also working to preserve as many of the home’s oddities as possible: the vintage submarine doors with thick portholes a giant dragon mural the library floor painted to look like a lily pond. She told me she loves the house’s “intricate chaos.”Gaga is an auction shopper — she likes to acquire iconic objects created by iconic personalities — and as I toured Zappa’s house it occurred to me that we were standing in a giant collector’s item of sorts an 8000-square-foot twig in the magpie’s nest of pop cultural artifacts that she has been building for a decade. In 2012 she purchased 55 items from Michael Jackson’s private archive including his leather “Bad” jacket and a crystal glove. That same year she bought an eggshell silk Alexander McQueen gown from the collection of the British fashion maven Daphne Guinness. In 2016 for her Dive Bar Tour in support of “Joanne” Gaga rolled up to a show in Elvis’s pink 1955 Cadillac Fleetwood (she was just borrowing it).Perhaps this collector’s impulse is what she absorbed from her early study of Warhol. Gaga is an artist of accrual of remixing and reimagination of pulling her heroes into her gravitational orbit. She once told an interviewer that her “whole career is a tribute to David Bowie” but her career is really a tribute to all the different ways a person can be monstrously famous: She wants to wear every costume live out every type of stardom to its maximalist extreme.If she was going to be a movie star she couldn’t just step into a role or a film that no one had ever heard of — she wanted to waltz into a lineage. When she was younger she told me she used to watch “The Wizard of Oz” over and over convinced that Judy Garland was the greatest entertainer alive. “Judy I just think she’s tremendous” she told me. “There’s a vulnerability behind her eyes the way she speaks she has big features. I just always wanted to be like her. It’s as simple as that.” And now she is standing on the very same stage.Earlier in the afternoon she showed me a room that was empty save for a gigantic photograph of her own face at least 15 feet across in a gilded frame. “It was a gift from Bradley” she said. “It’s the last frame of the movie. Do you know the scene?”I did know it. It is the moment when Ally is standing on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium — where Garland shot her final scene — in an ice blue evening gown singing a homage to her late husband. She starts out timid and drained of expression explaining to the audience that she is going to sing the last song that Jackson wrote for her and that maybe with their support she can get through it. But as the ballad goes on her voice swells and becomes an avalanche. It’s a bravura performance in extreme close-up a sort of symphonic summoning of every woman who has played the part. Gaga channels both the way Garland sang (wounded tonally bright barely holding it together) and the way Streisand did (forceful sweeping with a diffident jutting of the jaw). But Gaga adds something of her own: a sensual earthy confidence like gasoline in her veins.When she finishes a single elephant tear rolls down her face. Magically the moment somehow avoids bathos — the tear feels truly earned. After watching her perform this scene I felt elated by what Gaga managed to do not just for her character but for herself. You desperately want to know what her future holds after the curtain falls.I asked Gaga later what we can expect from her next phase. Of course there’s Vegas and a new record on the way and she’s reading piles of scripts. But she really didn’t want to discuss any of that. Instead she just smiled enigmatically. “Oh” she sighed. “I’m just shape-shifting again.”

 0,Republicans are well-positioned to win control of the House of Representatives in tomorrow’s elections and quite possibly to achieve the largest gain made by either party in a Congressional election since World War II.Our forecasting model which is based on a consensus of indicators including generic ballot polling polling of local districts expert forecasts and fund-raising data now predicts an average Republican gain of 54 seats (up one from 53 seats in last night’s forecast) and a median Republican gain of 55 seats. These figures would exceed the 52 seats that Republicans won from Democrats in the 1994 midterms.Moreover given the exceptionally large number of seats in play the Republicans’ gains could be significantly higher; they have better than a one-in-three chance of winning at least 60 seats a one-in-six chance of winning at least 70 seats and have some realistic chance of a gain exceeding 80 seats according to the model.However the same factors that could provide Republicans with extraordinarily large gains if their turnout is strong tomorrow could also cut against them if Democrats turn out in greater numbers than expected or if the polling has underestimated the Democrats’ standing.Of the projected Republican gains many are tenuous. If we allocate all 435 seats to the leader projected by our model — no matter how slim the margin — Republicans would net a gain of 59 seats. In 15 of these 59 seats however the Republican is projected to win by fewer than 2 points. It is likely that Republicans will lose at least some of these — which is why the model forecasts an average gain of 54-55 seats rather than 59 when looking at the seats on a probabilistic basis. If they lost all of them however their gains would be merely 44 seats which would put the Democrats within striking distance of retaining the House. And if Democrats beat their projected margins by about 3 points across the board they would be about even-money to keep control of the House.Such broad-based errors have occurred before in midterm elections. In 1998 essentially all key indicators predicted significant Republican gains but they actually lost 5 seats to the Democrats. In 1994 on the other hand many indicators pointed toward a total Republican gain of 20-30 seats when they in fact netted 52 from Democrats.Our model thinks there is a 16 percent chance of a polling and forecasting error large enough to allow Democrats to keep control of the House; this figure is unchanged from earlier this week.Still absent such a mistake Republicans will have much to celebrate. They are favorites to pick up seats in essentially all regions of the country with the possible exception of the Pacific Coast. Longtime Democratic incumbents like John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota are likely to lose their seats and others like Raúl M. Grijalva and James L. Oberstar now have a 25-30 percent chance of doing so according to the model. Some other Democratic incumbents like Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio appear to be considerably safer but could fall in a wave that exceeded 70 seats.We do not perceive any particularly dramatic nationwide movement toward one or another party in the closing days of the election. There is certainly no evidence in the polling that Democrats have closed their deficit with Republicans but claims that Republicans have expanded their margin are also tenuous as generic ballot trends have been roughly flat since Labor Day.However it has become abundantly clear that few if any Democrats will be spared a serious challenge from Republicans and recent polling has suggested that some who had seemed to be relatively safe — particularly in states like New Mexico Iowa Maine and Rhode Island where gubernatorial races have broken against Democrats — may in fact be quite vulnerable. It is possible and perhaps somewhat likely that a few Democrats in districts that have received little polling and little attention will fall. As a slight counterpoint to this districts containing Republican incumbents some of which might ordinarily be vulnerable have also received little attention from pollsters and Democrats could win a few of these even if they are having a fairly poor night over all.This will more likely than not be the final FiveThirtyEight House forecast of the 2010 cycle but we anticipate re-running the numbers if significant new polling data becomes available overnight.
 9,One factor that could help ease the market's reaction is that the prime rate increase simply follows the rise in other rates that has occurred recently in reaction to the decline in the dollar's value and the trade friction between the United States and Japan.Yesterday the two nations seemed to be trying to smooth over their differences. The United States trade representative Clayton K. Yeutter said the stock market on Monday overreacted to a decision by the United States to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese electronics and computer products. Big Board Composite Up 1.33Such talk helped alleviate some of Wall Street's concerns sending the New York Stock Exchange composite index up 1.33 points yesterday to 165.89 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 2.50 to 291.70.The average share gained 34 cents on the Big Board where advancing issues outnumbered losers by an impressive 993 to 591.Volume slipped however to 171.8 million shares yesterday from 208.4 million on Monday an indication market analysts say that investors were not fully comfortable with getting back into the action.That discomfort as it turned out may have been fortunate. At the close of business yesterday and right before the Citibank action stock index options contracts were trading at lower than normal.For example the premium on the S.&P. 500 index option contract which expires in June gained 0.80 point on the day while the cash index was up 2.50 points. That alone market experts say indicates that program traders will be selling stocks and buying these options at today's opening a development that could exacerbate any reaction to the rise in the prime rate.

 0,I nominate Kate Moore the protagonist of Chris Pavone’s sizzling thriller THE PARIS DIVERSION (Crown $27) for patron saint of working wives and mothers everywhere. Kate is the on-call parent of two rambunctious young boys Ben and Jake the problem-solving wife of a high-risk husband Dexter and the boss of the Paris substation of a clandestine American spy operation. On top of all that she’s expected to be the perfect expat mom a cut above those other expat wives with their “aggressive parenting fanatical nesting competitive entertaining.” It’s almost a relief when a suicide bomber strapped with explosives turns up at the Place Vendôme and gives Kate an excuse to get out of the house and back into the game.Pavone strikes a somber note here observing that Paris hasn’t been the same since the carnage at Charlie Hebdo in 2015. “There’s a general foreboding in the air” he explains. “There is no such thing as safety for anyone anywhere. Not anymore.” For Kate the new sign of the times is the sight of armored personnel carriers rolling down the Champs-Élysées.The novel’s carefully layered plot takes readers from the offices of a multinational company where a master of industry is planning a dicey corporate merger to a filthy alley where one hired killer confronts another. But at the heart of the story is the domestic drama playing out between Kate and Dexter. Distracted by worries about losing her job Kate fails to notice her husband’s increasingly reckless activities in the stock market. For his part Dexter has been lying to Kate about how deeply he’s gone into the market and where his investment money came from. Both characters are so realistically drawn that their quarrels sound unscripted. But Pavone takes great pains with all his characters from the stuffed-shirt C.E.O. who’s so full of himself that he doesn’t realize he’s been kidnapped to the unhappy suicide bomber who volunteered for a mission but didn’t understand it would involve blowing himself up.♦Isaiah Coleridge an intimidating presence in Laird Barron’s BLACK MOUNTAIN (Putnam $26) used to be a hit man for the mob.

(“Asking a professional how many people he’s dusted is discourteous.”) Nowadays Coleridge still works for the mob but as a fully licensed private eye operating out of a pretty hamlet in the Hudson Valley.
 0,Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.In addition to the domestic challenge it presented the fledgling Confederacy posed a foreign policy dilemma for Abraham Lincoln’s administration. The Confederacy hoped to use its position as a crucial source of cotton to secure recognition from foreign powers and boost its legitimacy and it sent commissioners abroad to sway other countries into supporting its cause.In response Secretary of State William Seward threatened war against European countries who interfered in America’s domestic conflict. But the administration wasn’t the only branch to enter the foreign-policy fray: In July 1861 Representative Samuel Sullivan Cox a Democrat from Ohio submitted a resolution calling on Lincoln to share with the House “all correspondence with the English French Spanish and other Governments with reference to the right of blockade privateering and the recognition of the so-called confederate States.” It passed with bipartisan ease as did two more similar resolutions submitted during the following weeks.Lincoln hardly welcomed such extensive oversight; on July 25 the same day that Representative Timothy Howe a Republican from Wisconsin submitted the third of the resolutions the president sent word to the House that the “correspondence called for” would not be forthcoming at that time. The reason for the delay is unclear: of the three resolutions Cox’s mentioned that the correspondence could be submitted “at the beginning of the next session of Congress” and the administration appears to have taken that as an opportunity to wait as long as feasible to release the documents.Eventually however Lincoln complied. In doing so he not only provided his contemporaries and future Americans with an almost real-time detailed look into the daily operations of the country’s foreign policy apparatus in crisis but he set a precedent for State Department transparency that is still followed today.Because the resolutions passed with little or no discussion we have little direct evidence for what Congress was thinking at the time. But we can infer a few things from the broader context. For one such requests were hardly unprecedented: throughout the early republic the legislature had asked for (and the executive branch had supplied) diplomatic instructions and dispatches related to treaties boundary disputes and other foreign affairs. And of course the war made foreign policy an especially touchy subject; by examining the correspondence Congress surely hoped to see that Seward was instructing ministers to appropriately defend American interests and that the ministers were faithfully carrying out the instructions.After months of delay Lincoln finally complied with the resolutions. On Dec. 3 1861 as the second session of the 37th Congress got underway Lincoln sent a message to both houses of Congress. The “message” portion of this communication was quite brief but attached to it was correspondence between the United States and its ministers abroad bound together in one volume (you can read the volume here).Lincoln’s missive opened with a short discussion of foreign relations before turning to other domestic matters. He characterized the Confederate effort to gain recognition from foreign governments as sputtering and unsuccessful noting “the disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected.” After dismissing Confederate diplomatic efforts Lincoln announced that he had submitted the requested correspondence and he hoped that those who read it would see that his administration had “practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign powers averting causes of irritation; and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor.”There followed 425 pages of correspondence between the government and its diplomatic ministers abroad (the United States would not have proper “ambassadors” until 1893). After printing a series of general circulars the volume reproduced material regarding 24 countries: not only the major European powers but most of Latin America and even Egypt the Hawaiian Islands and Japan.The material wasn’t for Congress alone; the White House released it to the public as well. For those who could not get their hands on the volume itself copies of its contents traveled quickly up and down the coast published in newspapers.By perusing the documents Americans could see how the Union defended its interests in countries large and small near and far. Obviously staving off Confederate agents was a key task for America’s ministers. Seward wrote to Carl Schurz the minister to Spain that preventing the Confederacy from gaining recognition was “your chief duty and no more important one was ever devolved by the United States upon any representative whom they have sent abroad.”Even in countries of lesser importance ministers were urged to be on the watch. Although Seward did not believe that the Confederates would attempt to gain recognition immediately from Denmark he wrote to his representative there that “political action even of the more commanding or more active States is influenced by a general opinion that is formed imperceptibly in all parts of the Eastern continent. Every representative of the United States in Europe has therefore a responsibility to see that no effort on his part is wanting to make that opinion just so far as the true position of affairs is in his own country is concerned.”Representatives abroad had an important public relations role to play particularly when news traveled slowly across the Atlantic Ocean and rumors were rife. Seward’s instructions encouraged ministers to not let discouraging news from America cloud foreigners’ perceptions of the war effort. After the First Battle of Bull Run in a letter marked “confidential” he wrote to Charles Francis Adams the minister in London that “you will hear of a reverse of our arms in Virginia” and encouraged him to think little of it. “The vigor of the government will be increased and the ultimate result will be a triumph of the Constitution” Seward wrote. “Do not be misled by panic reports of danger apprehended for the capital.” Seward likewise wrote to William Lewis Dayton in France that “treason was emboldened by its partial success at Manassas but the Union now grows manifestly stronger every day.” Foreigners could get their news from any number of sources and ministers had to stand ready to put a positive spin on events.The volume also exposed domestic readers to the administration’s frustration with the willingness of the British to treat the Confederates as belligerents. This step granted the Confederates some credibility even if it fell short of the full recognition they desired. In these documents Northern readers could see unbiased proof that this action did not go without protest. Adams proclaimed to the British that the Americans were “irritated” by the British treatment of Confederates as belligerents.Slavery is mentioned throughout the volume although at this point in the war the rhetoric was more about the dangers of the political power of Southern slaveholders than the virtues of emancipation. Slavery certainly got credit for causing the war. Seward wrote to Dayton in France that “the attempted revolution is simply causeless. It is indeed equally without a reason and without an object unless it be one arising out of the subject of slavery.” Seward instructed the representative in Russia that although slavery had existed in all the states at the time of the American Revolution “it was expected that under the operation of moral social and political influences then existing the practice of slavery would soon cease.” The “cause” of the rebellion was the fact that the slave states having suffered defeat at the polls in 1860 “took an appeal from the verdict of the people rendered through the ballot-box to the sword and organized a revolution with civil war.”Related Disunion Highlights Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. See the Highlights »The decision to release the material won glowing reviews. The Baltimore Sun reported on Dec. 9 that the correspondence was “receiving that close attention from persons skilled in diplomacy and public law which belongs to its distinguished source and the magnitude of the subject in question.” The Keene New Hampshire Sentinel reported that “in the whole of this correspondence the Secretary of State exhibits marked ability as a statesman and diplomatist.”By January 1862 the correspondence had reached the West Coast; the San Francisco Bulletin reported that the diplomatic correspondence was “quite voluminous” and “highly interesting.” Seward again came in for praise; his “high-toned” and “courteous” messages were “as nearly perfect models of diplomatic correspondence as are to be found on the pages of modern history.” The correspondence with Adams and Dayton “have swept to the winds all the aspersions of those who have accused him of favoring a timid and wavering policy in dealing with the rebels.” The volume attracted attention from abroad as well; shortly after its release Lord Richard Lyons British minister to the United States sent a copy to Lord John Russell the British foreign minister.What can we learn from this volume of foreign affairs documentation released as the first year of the war drew to a close? First it represents what the Lincoln administration wanted the American public to know about foreign affairs (as distinct from telling us in the modern day everything we might like to know about diplomacy during the Civil War). Judging by the newspaper response Americans were pleased with how the federal government was acting. Publishing the documentation also exposed British and French actions toward the Confederates which helped Americans direct their ire toward those two countries.Second the publication of the volume demonstrates the balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches during the mid-19th century: although the executive branch bore responsibility for foreign policy the legislative branch could wield significant power by demanding to see copies of the documentation.Perhaps most importantly the volume illustrates an early attempt at government openness — and given the exigencies of wartime a surprisingly forthright one. The summer resolutions requesting the documents made an allowance for Lincoln’s assessment of the “public interest” in determining which documents not to submit to Congress and we have no way of knowing what type of selection policy was in place. At the same time the resolutions make clear that Congress expected to receive something. Indeed diplomatic correspondence was released to Congress on an ad hoc basis throughout the early republic; but that it was still done in a moment of clear crisis demonstrates that Lincoln’s administration saw the value in getting the correspondence in the public’s hands.There is a final consequence which no one in 1861 could likely have foretold: The State Department continues to publish edited collections of foreign affairs documentation 150 years later. Although the Foreign Relations of the United States series does not release documents as rapidly as Lincoln did and so has become a historical look at American foreign relations rather than a contemporary publication of documents the release of the volume in 1861 set a landmark democratic precedent: that the American government must on a regular basis keep the public informed about its foreign policy operations.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Sources: Congressional Globe; Howard Jones “Blue and Gray Diplomacy: A History of Confederate Foreign Relations”; Roy Basler ed. “Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln” Vol. IV; Message of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the Commencement of the Second Session of the 37th Congress.“Aaron W.

 0,“Craft has always been art’s poor relation. I imagine because it’s functional and people sometimes don’t like to see the value in something you can use as much as something you can put on a wall” says Catherine Lock co-founder of the New Craftsmen a unique space in London dedicated to selling and promoting the work of small-scale British artisans. “I see craft as art we can live with in a real way.” After working as a product developer at the popular English home décor chain Habitat and for the British Council promoting local designers of all sorts at home and abroad Lock spotted a gap in the market for a business that sold handmade works such as ceramics and textiles in the elevated curated manner of an art gallery. In 2012 the then-39-year-old toured the U.K. for five months searching every remote corner of the country for hidden talent — a pair of potters from the isolated wilds of Wales a furniture maker from the misty forests of Kent a textile designer working in the smallest of studios in East London — to sell in a temporary space she secured in London’s Mayfair neighborhood. “I went where the wind took me. One artist would tell me about another” says Lock. “I was hunting for objects but it also ended up being a journey into my own culture. What I’m doing is as much about what goes on our shelves as the stories of the people making these wonderful things.”Lock and her two partners have since moved into a permanent brick-and-mortar space in north Mayfair and launched an e-commerce website that provides bios for each artisan images of the studio spaces they work from and most importantly a carefully edited selection of their work. In May they revamped the store to include a studio space where interior designers and individuals can meet with any maker in the New Craftsmen stable to collaborate on custom projects. It can also be used as a spot for an artist to work on a piece that will be sold at the store. “My commercial background helps me advise our makers on which pieces will be successful without sacrificing the authenticity” says Lock. “We want to help them focus the spirit of their work.”

 0,The word famiglia in a food store's name can be problematic. Named to suggest a homemade quality to the food it sells (perhaps even using nonna's recipe) a famiglia store runs the risk of criticism if it fails to deliver authentic food. But if the food is good -- or better yet excellent as it is at Mia Famiglia in Millburn -- a famiglia store is the go-to place when you need to cater your own family gatherings (but don't think anyone will believe you when you try to pass off the food as a family recipe).Mia Famiglia is the rare Italian store in that it actually resembles a store you could find in Italy. Or as owner Emanuele Licitra puts it "When people from Italy come in here they say 'I feel like I'm home'." That's probably because they recognize many brands as what they have in their cupboards.Take the Strianese tomatoes. You've probably never heard of Strianese but as Mr. Licitra explains you may want to try them not only because they are less expensive than San Marzano tomatoes (which he also sells) but because these dark tomatoes taste the way tomatoes used to 40 years ago. Some highlights of the hard-to-find imports include squid-ink spaghetti 12-year-old balsamic vinegar truffle cream and jumbo baccala. Mr. Licitra and his wife Sharon also make sausage (loaded with fennel) and age cheese on-site. Prices for the groceries vary but are moderate.But the main draw at least on a workday is the sandwich bar which features a daily special of panini focaccia and frittata. Mia Famiglia's signature sandwich is the eggplant wedge with lightly fried eggplant that's been marinated in balsamic vinegar and is topped with smoked mozzarella roasted peppers and arugula ($4.50). The bread is a dream and you can't go wrong if that's all you order perhaps with one topping such as the marinated artichoke hearts. Add a cup of the homemade soup of the day ($2.50) and you'll have the perfect lunch.KELLY FEENEYMia Famiglia (formerly Tony and Angela's) 277 Main Street Millburn; (973) 467-5740.

 0,Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie Mr. Reilly the Glaxo executive was led in handcuffs into a small courtroom in the city of Changsha in central China in September 2014. With security guards behind him he stood alongside four other senior Glaxo executives as a judge read the charges.“The defendant company GSKCI is guilty of bribing nongovernment personnel and will be fined 3 billion yuan” the judge Wu Jixiang said sternly referring to Glaxo’s Chinese name. The company and the executives having confessed were given relatively light sentences the court said.Mark Reilly was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to be expelled from China.After handing down that sentence the judge turned to Mr. Reilly.“Do you obey the court’s verdict? Do you appeal?” he asked.Mr. Reilly said that he would not challenge the verdict. Because he was swiftly deported he will not serve prison time in China.Glaxo is still trying to clean up the mess.In China Glaxo has promised to overhaul its operations and has put in place stricter compliance procedures. The company has changed the way its sales force is compensated and has eliminated the use of outside travel agencies.Glaxo has also tightened oversight of expenses and cash advances areas central to the case. Employees must now send in photographs of the guests and food to verify that the meetings took place.And in August 2015 Glaxo tried to make amends by rehiring Ms. Shi an acknowledgment that the company had erred in firing an employee suspected of being a whistle-blower.

 0,Readers respond to David Brooks’s Dec. 1 column “The Age of Skepticism“:Maureen Scott Kansas City Mo.: I feel obligated to respond to the following portion of your latest column in the context of the Great Depression: “As the Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman has observed Americans begin social reforms when they are feeling confident not when they are weary and insecure.”At the depths of the Depression social reforms took priority . . . To say that the nation was feeling confident at that time would be a misnomer. It took the overwhelming will of a strong leader Roosevelt to keep on message about the positive nature of our nation to set reforms in motion.What we lack right now as a nation is a strong leader who we can rally around. I see no such persons in our political parties that are ready to step up to this challenge to overcome partisan politics and do what is necessary for the future of this nation. THAT is what makes me weary and insecure. We need another Lincoln to overcome the divides and remind us what this country was founded upon.Ted Brown San Francisco: Your essay today provides an interesting bookend to your piece on the unappreciated heroism of our troops.The common theme in both it seems to me is one I’ve seen in a lot of political writing in the past 10 years. In different ways for instance both E.J. Dionne and Christopher Lasch have discussed the retreat of Americans from responsibilities outside of their own property lines their own private circle of concerns. Is it any wonder that the exurbs are a popular attractive residence destinations for millions of Americans? A place where the evils of the world like poverty and disease and war are kept at bay or at least vicariously experienced through violent video games a place where personal dreams and ambitions are fostered without much care for civic or patriotic sentiments and habits.What should our government do given these circumstances? I think in part this willed personal isolation explains the appeal of current conservative politics to so many Americans — the idea that governance is somehow a problem not an essential part and positive good of any civilization. In a subtle way it’s an easy step to see civic obligations and patriotic sacrifice as part of the evils of government. After all don’t such sensibilities force us to connect with our political institutions? And this is why this administration has failed in its leadership it has neither asked nor inspired the majority of Americans to commit to the war on terrorism or in day-to-day terms to drive an economy car instead of an S.U.V. because we need to save our resources to win this war.Michael Koplow Woburn Mass.: It is not as bad as you suggest. It is a question of leadership in this country and as you well know but seldom state our leaders in Washington under this administration are woefully unqualified to manage the country’s affairs.Why not state the obvious reason for such skepticism in the U.S. the incompetence of the current administration. If we get capable leadership the public’s skepticism will evaporate.Paul Corning San Francisco: One of the most significant social changes in my lifetime happened with the transition to Ronald Reagan’s presidency.If I remember correctly it happened not at a time when Americans were feeling confident but at a point of near despair over our economy and our power in the world. Reagan’s reforms pale in comparison to FDR’s which were larger and were attempted during far more difficult times.It is pain and fear that encourages us to change. Unfortunately we probably have a lot of both ahead before we get serious about change.Steven Campbell Oakland Calif.: While I agree with Mr. Brooks that we are living in a time when the American people view their government with equal measures of skepticism and cynicism I am once again disturbed by his unwillingness to put much of the blame where it belongs — the Republican Party.While I agree that the Democratic Party is far from blameless the Republicans have practically made cynicism their political strategy. After 9/11 President Bush had the opportunity to put his money where his mouth was and actually be the uniter he claimed to be. Unfortunately he instead squandered national unity and resolve on partisan political goals putting party before country.When politicians clear cut trees in the name of healthy forests or weaken air pollution controls and call it clear skies is it any wonder that the American people are cynical?Tim Potter Oceanside Calif.: You are right on the money when you say that the American public is skeptical about the U.S. government’s ability especially this Bush administration to ‘solve the deep problems that are rooted in history and culture.’This skepticism was cured on Vietnam and Watergate. I disagree that it leads or will lead to passivity. If a person is let down enough by a situation or others long enough they figure out eventually that they can not rely on that situation or persons and that they need to take matters into their own hands. The most successful people throughout history have not waited for anyone to give them permission to realize their dreams.I submit that what is happening now is a new awakening where people are seeing behind the veil of illusion that government as it is now solves our problems initiates change or meaningfully effect our lives.Albert Sayers Pound Ridge N.Y.: There is one component you missed in your essay about cynicism and that is honesty. I have heard you over and over again say that how we got into the war is over and how we are going to go forward is what matters and so let’s go.Yes We need to move forward. But people understand when they have been deceived and that is how they feel now. They know there were no W.M.D.’s especially nuclear ones that scared us all to death. They know the occupation was bungled but they hear the administration saying the insurgents are in their last throes. If the administration did not lie about W.M.D. and it was the intelligence that was bad they want to know why the president gave the head of the C.I.A. a medal! . . . It just does not add up.On Sunday Sen. Warner said the president should have a fireside chat like Roosevelt did. What made those chats work is that when he told you what was going to happen and why the facts unfolded to support his statements. That builds trust. Misleading the people leads to cynicism.Lastly when you treat people who disagree with you . . . with contempt you are in fact saying you have contempt for the system that gives them their voice in the first place. . .
 9,THE passing of the Bush Administration and the likely demise of its regulation-diluting Council on Competitiveness are generally considered good news for companies in the environmental business analysts say. Although they caution that the coming Clinton Administration is not likely to fulfill all of the promises made on the campaign trail mainly because of economic constraints analysts say the Government's tone will shift in favor of environmental projects."We are clearly going to see more enforcement of regulations in the new Administration more hazardous waste cleanup and maybe more funding for waste water plants" said Vishnu Swarup an analyst at Prudential Securities Research. The industry has been weak for the last two years as a result of the economic recession and lax regulation he said.Grant Ferrier editor of the newsletter Environmental Business Journal said growth in the environmental industry slowed sharply in the 1990's after gaining at a 20 percent annual rate for most of the 1980's. Growth slowed to 10 percent in 1990 and 2 percent last year he said.Now the San Diego-based publication is projecting a return to higher growth in an industry that ranges from garbage collectors to high-tech engineering and consulting firms. Total revenues in the industry are expected to grow to $174 billion by 1996 from about $120 billion currently. That is $28 billion more than the Environment Business Journal estimates the industry would have generated in revenue if the Bush Administration's policies had continued for four more years.

 9,Yonkers SchoolsCancel RecessYonkers public school students got a lesson in brinksmanship last week from the City Council and the school board which have been fighting over a $12 million gap in the school budget. The council promised to provide the money last summer but with the fiscal year half over and no additional money in sight school officials decided two weeks ago to force the issue.The board voted to shut all 32 schools for three weeks this month and to lay off 49 teachers and 89 other school employees in February.At a meeting the next day the City Council reaffirmed its pledge to add the $12 million to the $88 million school budget but then voted to appropriate only $2 million. Council members who said the schools had enough money to remain open until at least April then voted to raise their own salaries by $2600 or 16 percent.Facing threatened lawsuits to keep schools open officials of the city which came close to default in July last week reached an accord: Council members again pledged to close the gap and school officials promised that classes would resume as scheduled this week at the end of the Christmas vacation. Mayor Angelo R. Martinelli said $3 million would come from Federal revenue- sharing money auctions of city property and parking fines; plans for finding the remaining $9 million were vague he said although the city may look for a state loan.
 9,Back where Wayne Radloff lived long before he enrolled at the University of Georgia some of the people might have a difficult time understanding what he is doing this week.There is usually silliness surrounding a championship football game in England where Radloff spent the first 10 years of his life. But there football is a sport played with a round ball and with no need for layer upon layer of protective equipment. And although a British football club's followers may overwhelm a city for a game there are few invasions in the world that can compare to the one that travels from Georgia to New Orleans this time of year in which grown men and women otherwise respectable citizens fill streets restaurants and hotel lobbies with their cries:Dawgs! Sic 'em! Woof-woof-woof-woof-woof! Radloff the Georgia center and captain and the only senior starter on the offensive line that helped Herschel Walker win the Heisman Trophy spent nearly half his life in London and Ipswich as a child in a United States Air Force family.H e will play against Penn State tonight in the Sugar Bowl game with the nation's top ranking at stake. Radloff will play a game that may not seem very logical where he was born because the game requires that the linemen most necessary to helping the players that move the ball are rewarded with the worst view of the results of their effort.''A lot of times'' Radloff said ''you can't see a thing and the fans are screaming and Herschel's down in the end zone. You can't see it when Herschel breaks three or four tackles especially in a pile. It's really probably a bad seat.''

On Wednesday Mr. Villazón’s managers said that the tenor needed surgery as soon as possible to remove a cyst from his vocal cords.

Trump promised as a presidential candidate to do — or to weaken the nation’s commitment under the deal to reducing greenhouse gases while remaining in the accord.The provision at issue Article 4.11 states that a nation “may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition.” The question is whether the ability to “adjust” is like a ratchet allowing progress only in one direction — upward — or if it permits a country to weaken its commitment without violating the terms of the deal.The fight within the White House over what to do about the Paris deal has been going on for months. One side led by the president’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Scott Pruitt the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has argued that the language of the provision does not allow nations to weaken their commitments. They urge the president to withdraw entirely from the Paris deal.

 9,The evolution from the 1991's (too young and probably not too promising) through the 1990's (just beginning to open up) and the 1989's (already delicious) speaks well of these wines. At the same time there is a certain heaviness (this may be unfair; I've been drinking Pauillacs) and an absence -- or at least a shortage -- of elegance. Rustic is a word that comes to mind. (This too may be unfair; I've also been drinking Leoville-Barton.)Of course these wines are expected to be rounder and softer than their austere cousins in the Medoc; don't they call neighboring Pomerol the Burgundy of Bordeaux? These Fronsacs readily equal some fairly well known St.-Emilions.The Expression group includes chateaus from the two Fronsac appellations Canon-Fronsac which has a reputation for slightly better wines and Fronsac itself which surrounds Canon-Fronsac. Barrabaque Cassagne Haut-Canon Mazeris-Bellevue and Moulin-Pey-Labrie are in Canon-Fronsac. In this group they showed no better and no worse than the Fronsac wines.Expression de Fronsac is only a part of what the appellation has to order. There are more than 100 chateaus in the little Fronsac towns of Saillans St.-Michel St.-Aignan and Fronsac itself some of them better known than those in the Expression group. Canon Moueix Canon de Brem La Dauphine Haut-Laroque La Fleur Canon and La Riviere are names that turn up from time to time. All these properties are owned or managed by the Moueix family.While Fronsac wines are not well known in the United States they sell well in the Low Countries and Germany. Many of the small chateaus have thriving mail-order businesses supplying the same customers every year. To some extent this market isolates them from the larger Bordeaux market which has stagnated in recent years despite excellent vintages.Prices are dropping fast in France and it's likely that considerable amounts of good Bordeaux will come on the market soon at attractive prices. To compete lesser-known areas like Fronsac if they don't pull out of the market entirely will have to offer very good values. There could be some interesting Fronsacs in your future. The near future. TASTINGS Pedroncelli Merlot Sonoma County Calif. 1989; about $10.The Pedroncellis have been making good moderately priced wines in the Dry Creek region of Sonoma County for 90 years and they have always given good value. They use their own grapes and grapes purchased from neighbors and growers to the east in the Alexander Valley. The wines are rarely blockbusters but then no one wants to drink big intense wines every day. This delightful merlot is a good example of the Pedroncelli style: it isn't out to make a statement. The different varietal characteristics between merlot and cabernet sauvignon are much less pronounced in California than in Europe or on Long Island. But this wine is clearly a merlot. It has a degree of mellowness and roundness that one looks for in merlots from St.-Emilion and the other communes east of Bordeaux where the merlot grape flourishes. It even resembles some of the easy-drinking merlots from northern Italy. It is a full-flavored wine meant to go with casual meals and meant for drinking now.

 9,To the Editor:Re ''A Turbulent Trade Meeting'' (editorial Nov. 28): The World Trade Organization's anti-environmental rulings have gone far beyond only insisting that ''laws not discriminate against foreign suppliers.'' W.T.O. panels held to be illegal standards protecting sea turtles and dolphins from both foreign and domestic fishing fleets on the ground that the standards should not uniformly regulate the process of catching fish. The W.T.O. also disapproved a European ban on hormone-fed beef on scientific grounds.If the W.T.O. discourages effective efforts to address major international and domestic environmental problems in the long run it may undermine prosperity rather than promote it.DAVID M.

 9,''Break It Down'' Lydia Davis's new collection of fiction just out from Farrar Straus & Giroux gives us 34 stories in 177 pages. Half a dozen of these ''stories'' are no more than a page - or a paragraph - long. The one called ''Safe Love'' reads in its entirety:''She was in love with her son's pediatrician. Alone out in the country - could anyone blame her.''There was an element of grand passion in this love. It was also a safe thing. The man was on the other side of a barrier. Between him and her: the child on the examining table the office itself the staff his wife her husband his stethoscope his beard her breasts his glasses her glasses etc.''As part of a larger narrative collage this fragment might help shed light on certain characters or a situation. And alone it might serve as a good idea for a story even a good idea for a good story. As it stands however it's nothing but an unrealized sketch a free-floating bit of prose. Why then one wonders did Ms. Davis - who elsewhere in ''Break It Down'' demonstrates a gift for narrative complexity an ability to capture and orchestrate emotional nuances -choose to include such flimsy pieces in this volume?The thing is Ms. Davis is hardly alone in publishing the sort of fragments that writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald used to relegate to their notebooks. Michelangelo Antonioni's new book for instance consists entirely of what he calls ''nuclei'' - that is scenarios for possible films. Some of the entries in ''That Bowling Alley on the Tiber'' sound like newspaper clippings describing heavily ironic events (i.e. some people go on a crocodile hunt and are subsequently eaten by their would-be prey); others are nothing but perfunctory descriptions of vaguely ominous landscapes.In a sense such ''stories'' represent another dead end reached by the Minimalism so popular in the last decade. Spareness of expression a willful refusal to impute motive or interpret character an inability or unwillingness to use the conventions of traditional narrative - all were initially strategies invoked by writers to portray the alienation experienced by a generation. And they were strategies that mirrored in their very form the post-60's sense of discontinuity and flux. In the hands of such writers as Raymond Carver and Ann Beattie this approach could result in tightly controlled works of considerable emotional power; but at its worst it dwindles into a grudging fiction in which the white space between the words and lines seeps into - and subsumes - the actual stories.

 0,CORTLAND N.Y. — The more time that Rex Ryan spends in front of the cameras the more it becomes clear that should this whole coaching thing not pan out he would make one heck of a stand-up comedian.I like to watch the other reporters when Ryan cracks jokes. Sometimes they hold their stomachs to stifle laughter. Other times they try to bottle that laughter but fail miserably nearly falling off their chairs.I wrote about Ryan – and the contrast in styles with Eric Mangini the former coach – for an article that is online and will run in Sunday’s paper. Regardless the jokes just keep on coming. What follows are a few excerpts from Ryan’s latest stand-up routine er news conference held on Saturday morning. A news conference that started it should be noted with Ryan jogging to the podium and pronouncing he was getting his “jog on.”On the first scuffle of training camp between offensive tackle Damien Woody and defensive end Shaun Ellis on Saturday morning:A: That’s one that nobody would break up. Like Guys just keep fighting until you die.On what safety Jim Leonhard looks like without pads on:A: I told both him and (Danny) Woodhead that my kid is playing for Summit High School and that if there is a conflict they need to play for us and not Summit. They were having to do both I think (laughs). They look like they can be in high school.On Day II of his diet:A: Why’d you bring that up (laughing)? Let me tell you this – the vegetable part of it way worse than I even thought. We should have a bonus cup for anybody who would like to give it a shot. I’m not kidding. We can put one here. You guys can see it. (The color) is hard to describe it (looks) like rust (laughs). I plugged in my nose to drink it. It’s absolutely brutal. But hey I’m hanging in there. It’s Day Two so we’ll see.On Kris Jenkins’s calf injury:A: (It will be) a few days for Jenkins. (He will) definitely miss the special teams practice (laughing). I don’t think we’re going to have Jenkins long snap today (laughs).Comedy aside Ryan addressed several more newsy topics. Kellen Clemens looked as sharp as a Marine’s sword early during the morning practice including on a deep ball he floated to receiver Jerricho Cotchery in double coverage for a gain of about 50 yards. But Clemens tempered that excitement with two more interceptions giving him three total picks in the first three practices.“You see that he’s got a really good grasp of this system” Ryan said. “This is his fourth year. When you talk about the difference right now with him and Mark Sanchez is out there going through it learning a little bit where Clemens knows it. He has a great grasp of it and makes very few mistakes with his checks.”Clemens outperformed Sanchez on Saturday although it’s impossible to say that one quarterback leads the other after two days.Sanchez worked with the second team had several passes batted down and when the second-team offensive line came off the field after one series guard Stanley Daniels announced to his fellow linemen within earshot of reporters that “he doesn’t have his cadence down.” Daniels was presumably talking about the quarterback.Sanchez did struggle with his cadence in the off-season – he even practiced by shouting in front of his mirror at a hotel – but Ryan said later he had improved. That said one of the Jets biggest problems so far according to Ryan was too many false-start penalties. And cadence is one part of that.“That’s what we have to learn from offensively – don’t put yourself in a hole” Ryan said speaking specifically about the penalties. “We talked about this earlier about how if you have to beat us physically this is going to be a tough football team to beat. We can’t have those mistakes.”Both of Clemens’s interceptions landed in the hands of Leonhard nicknamed White Lightning by his former teammates in Baltimore. Ryan said that Leonhard disguises coverages as well as anyone in the N.F.L. other than his former Ravens teammate Ed Reed.On the injury front nose tackle Kris Jenkins limped off the field during the morning practice with a calf injury. Jenkins will miss some practice time probably less than a week and said: “It’s nothing serious. I won’t skip a beat.” Woodhead missed practice in the morning after a hit knocked him woozy on Friday but he returned in the afternoon wearing a red no-contact jersey.The rookie running back Shonn Greene did not have an injury during practice but he did absorb a vicious and legal blow from linebacker Bryan Thomas. Ryan called this Greene’s “welcome to the N.F.L. moment.”Ryan also said that he wanted the Jets to increase the tempo of practice and there was a noticeable difference between the Saturday and Friday sessions.

 0,We said it here back in December and even though they still haven’t won the Stanley Cup yet against a Penguins team with enormous potential we’ll say it again anyway: the Detroit Red Wings are the gold standard for all of hockey.The Wings were great from the start and except for a stretch in February when they were hit hard by injuries great the whole season long. And they were great in the way they have been for the last several years: by placing a heavy emphasis on winning the regular-season championship and by playing a clean game that shunned fighting.That we should see such a team ascend to the summit of hockey is such a fresh hopeful sign and exactly what the game needs the year after the Stanley Cup victory of the Red Wings’ moral opposites — the cynical fight-instigating Anaheim Ducks with their enormous penalty totals and derision of the Presidents’ Trophy as a useless prize. Because of the Ducks we got this year’s brawling and suspension-ridden Flyers and the fight-happy Calgary Flames and the refusal of NHL clubs to draft Europeans because of “character questions.”If the Red Wings hoist the Stanley Cup in the next handful of days they will have repudiated all of those choices and perhaps shown the way to a better game. Maybe their victory will have the same effect as the Canadiens’ sweep of Philadelphia in the 1976 cup final which helped quell the epidemic of senseless violence brought on by those Flyers and ushered in an era of freer-flowing hockey in its place.Maybe a Wings’ victory will mean that next season NHL teams will actually try to win the regular-season championship — so that if you pay a fortune for a ticket in December you’ll actually see teams giving 100 percent. And maybe those teams instead of starting fights will stick to playing hockey. And maybe finally at long last the voices of reaction will cease their old tired reflexive whine about European softness.Or maybe not. Maybe some retrograde outfit like the Ducks or Flyers will win in 2009 and wipe out the advances the Wings have brought to the NHL this year. But no matter what happens then and no matter what happens Monday night or later in the week one thing remains unchanged: The Detroit Red Wings have given hockey fans an amazing season one that all of us have been lucky to witness.Doing the Double: If the Wings do indeed prevail a fourth time against Pittsburgh they’ll be the 10th team since 1980 to accomplish the utmost feat in a single campaign: winning both the regular-season crown and the Stanley Cup. That 1979-80 season was the year the NHL absorbed 4 WHA sides and expanded to 21 clubs over all and the first season when 16 teams made the playoffs.This is the current roll call of double champions:1981 Islanders1982 Islanders1984 Edmonton1987 Edmonton1989 Calgary1994 Rangers1999 Dallas*2001 Colorado2002 Detroit
 9,Israel conducted an aerial bombardment tonight of what it said were four Hezbollah guerrilla strongholds deep inside Lebanon stung into action by a week of attacks that culminated in the killing of a general and three other Israelis in southern Lebanon earlier today.The air strikes took the conflict away from the Israeli-Lebanon border and into the heart of Lebanon risking an escalation of ping-pong attacks between the Israeli Army and the guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Party of God or Hezbollah.The heavy bombing ended a day of intense conflict in the low-level war in southern Lebanon beginning with unsuccessful rocket attacks on northern Israel. The final catalyst for their attack Israeli officials said was a roadside bomb this morning that killed the four Israelis including Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein 36 who became the highest-ranking officer to die in southern Lebanon in 16 years.A journalist Ilan Roeh 32 of Voice of Israel radio was also among those killed. He was accompanying the general to ''see things up close'' said his boss Shalom Oren.

 9,''Mr. Schroder said they will have a special board meeting next week when they will discuss the problems of the Bondi painting'' he said. ''He said he thought the case should be investigated thoroughly but at the same time he said that the Austrian Gallery's records showed there was nothing wrong.'' The conversation took place before Mr. Korte was aware of the Reif claim.And late yesterday Mr. Schroder also telephoned Constance Lowenthal the director of the Commission for Art Recovery of the World Jewish Congress the panel of which Mr. Lauder is chairman. The commission might get involved she said although it does not go into business until mid-January and Mr. Schroder has asked Ms. Lowenthal to support the Leopold Foundation's effort in finding out the truth about the Bondi painting's ownership.''These cases have moved to the top of our priority lists'' Ms. Lowenthal said.She said that she had not yet seen any paperwork on the Reifs' claim but was reviewing the Bondi family's documentation ''with a view to determining our course of action and it is voluminous and complex.'' Mr. Lauder she said declined to comment until the commission had taken a position on the cases.Of the two cases Mrs. Bondi's has the more thorough documentation. After the war she tried many times from her home in London to reclaim ''Wally.'' Although she never filed a lawsuit seeking its return she wrote many letters to lawyers in Vienna and she sought help from Otto Kallir a Viennese dealer who also fled the Nazis and who owned the Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan. Dr. Kallir who compiled catalogues raisonnes of Schiele's works in 1930 and 1966 offered to serve as a witness to her ownership of the painting letters from the 1960's show.Mrs. Bondi also asked for help in retrieving ''Wally'' from Dr. Leopold who had come to London in search of works by Schiele Gustav Klimt and other artists. In return she promised to help find drawings and other works by Schiele for him in London where she owned St. George's Gallery. Dr. Leopold ignored her pleas for the return of ''Wally.''''The problem was she trusted Leopold'' said Ruth Rozanek a niece of Mrs. Bondi who lives in Bellevue Wash. ''There were financial constrictions that didn't allow her to sue. But she should have sued.''
 0,After another wild polling ride in Michigan it is time for a reflection on just how accurate primary and caucus polls have been — both in an absolute sense and as compared with past years. This discussion of course also has implications for the FiveThirtyEight forecast model which is based upon the polls.The short version: the polls have been reasonably good in the last few days before the election. Not perfect by any means — worse than general election polling typically is for example. But no worse and probably somewhat better than in past primaries.In densely polled states — that term importantly would disqualify Colorado — there haven’t been any huge surprises on Election Day itself. If you think it counts as a surprise that Mitt Romney won Michigan by three points when polls showed a rough tie or that Rick Santorum narrowly won Iowa when he was a couple of points back you don’t have a realistic conception of how reliable primary and caucus polling is.On the other hand the polls have been pretty awful at most points prior to about three days before the election seeing surges and momentum shifts that often dissipated.The chart below tracks the error in the polls and compares it to the number of days in advance of the election that they were conducted. The error is measured by looking at how much the polls missed the final margin between the top two candidates. For example if Newt Gingrich beat Mitt Romney by 12 points in South Carolina and the poll called for Mr. Gingrich to win by 5 points instead that would count as a 7-point error. And if the poll had forcasted Mr. Romney to win the state by 5 points instead it would represent a 17-point error.Only the candidates who actually finished in the top two are considered. If an Iowa poll had Mr. Romney in first Ron Paul in second and Rick Santorum in third this method looks only at the difference it showed between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum ignoring the value it had for Mr. Paul. (This is the same technique that I use to calculate my pollster ratings.)On average a poll conducted on the day just before the election has missed the final margin between the candidates by about 4 percentage points. That is reasonably good; the comparable statistic for state polls in presidential general elections is something like 2 or 3 points and primaries and caucuses are much more challenging to poll.However the errors have increased significantly the further you go out. Polls conducted just three days before the primary have missed by an average of about 7 points and those conducted a week out have missed by about 10.And the whole period from about one week to two weeks before the primary has been a disaster with an average miss of about 12 points. That’s just the average not even the worst of it; quite a few polls especially in Florida and South Carolina missed by 20 or more points.Things oddly actually get a bit better when you go further back than that. Polls conducted a month before the primary have missed by an average of about 9 points — actually a bit better than those only a week or so in advance.This could just be a fluke — this looks like a ton of data but almost all of it is from about six states some of which voted at the same time as one another and were subject to the same currents of momentum.With that said if you see a sudden shift in the momentum in a state it’s at least worth considering what the polls had said about the state beforehand. The momentum shifts — at least as measured by the polls — have been very significant in this race and unlike anything we have seen routinely in the past. The problem is that sometimes that momentum has been a false alarm with the polls soon reverting back to form. The exception has been momentum swings in the final few days of the campaign; those usually have held up and have been reflected in the actual results.The FiveThirtyEight forecast model as you might expect has been affected by these quirks. Unlike most of our other forecasting products which tend to blend polls with various types of economic or demographic data our primary forecasts look at polls and polls alone. In fact they double-down on them: the program is designed to place a heavy emphasis on the most recent polls and tries to infer what momentum exists in the race and extrapolate that forward.If you look at how the FiveThirtyEight forecasts have performed on Election Day itself they’ve done pretty well. On average they’ve missed the final margin between the top two candidates by 2.8 points so far.(Note: I exclude Nevada from the calculation although the forecast there was pretty good because we issued that prediction only a day or two before the state voted. We did not issue forecasts thankfully for Minnesota Colorado or Maine since the polling there was thin to nonexistent.)The 2.8-point miss is a fair bit better than how individual polls have done: it is useful to take an average of different surveys on the chance that their errors will cancel out. In addition to taking a simple average however the FiveThirtyEight model also does some more complicated stuff. It weights the polls differently based on their past accuracy and their sample size for instance although in practice this makes very little difference. What does distinguish the FiveThirtyEight model is that it is very aggressive about trying to determine the momentum or trend in the race.This has served the model well on Election Day. By comparison the Real Clear Politics forecasts — which use a perfectly sensible but simpler and more conservative approach — have missed by an average of 4.4 points. Most of the difference comes from Iowa and South Carolina states where there was a very late momentum swing that the FiveThirtyEight model captured more fully.However this aggressive approach has decidedly not paid dividends at earlier periods in these contests when the model made big bets on what turned out to be false starts. On average the forecasts we published one week before each election missed the final margin by an average of 13.8 points.Most of this is just because the polling itself has been inaccurate but the simpler approach used by Real Clear Politics average has done slightly better missing by an average of 12.9 points instead.In addition to comparing the FiveThirtyEight model with its competition however it is also worth looking at the standards it sets for itself. It does not claim to be all that accurate — but is it accurate about how inaccurate it is? (Although this might sound ridiculous it is precisely the kind of thing that forecasters in fields ranging from economics to climate change need to spend more time thinking about.)Our current forecast in Ohio is that Mr. Romney will get 31 percent of the vote there. But the confidence interval attached to the forecast (which represents 90 percent of the possible outcomes) is wide: it ran from 17 points to 42 points. The reason these intervals are so wide is simply because they are built from historical data and this isn’t the first year that polls in primaries and caucuses have missed the mark.What’s been unusual however is the way in which these errors have been related to the timing of the election. In the past polls have gotten somewhat more accurate as we’ve approached Election Day but the improvement has been gradual. This year the polls have gone from quite bad to quite good almost literally overnight — typically about three days before the election.The next chart provides a clear demonstration of this. It compares the actual error in the FiveThirtyEight model at points in time ranging to 25 days before the election against what the model thinks the error should be based on the historical data. Less technically it compares the error in primary polls this year with that of past election cycles.For instance the model is supposed to miss the final margin by about 6 points when it issues a forecast on Election Day. The actual error — 2.8 points — has been much less than that.That’s a good thing right? Well maybe. It probably makes my life easier. In the short term however it is probably just good luck. And in the long term it could imply that the forecasts are underconfident — that the confidence intervals we publish are too wide and reflect more uncertainty about the outcome than there really is.You would have just the opposite discussion of course if you looked at the forecasts we have issued 7 to 14 days in advance. Not only have they been inaccurate but they have been even less accurate than claimed — and we don’t claim they are very accurate to begin with!But this too arguably reflects a certain amount of “luck” (bad luck in this case). Over the whole 25-day period the forecasts have been pretty well-calibrated: it’s just that the “hits” have tended to be concentrated on election night itself and the misses have peaked a week or two beforehand.This need not be so abstract a discussion however. Can we come up with a better explanation than “luck” to describe what we are seeing in the polls?If I had to use a word to describe the behavior of Republican voters so far in this race it would be this one: indifferent. Their preferences between the various candidates have been very weak shifting after seemingly every debate primary and news cycle. Many Republican voters like two or more candidates equally well — or at least see two or more of them as being less bad than the others.To be sure it may also be that the polls are exaggerating this tendency. Most polls now and especially automated polls have very low response rates only getting a small fraction of the people they call to stay on the phone. This may bias the polls in favor of candidates whose voters are most excited about the race on that particular evening. If you called a Rick Santorum supporter the day after Mr. Santorum won Minnesota and Colorado he would probably be giddy and pleased to talk to you — whereas a Mitt Romney supporter would have been despondent and hung up the phone.It is of course a good thing for a candidate to have enthusiastic supporters. But their voters need to be excited at the right time: on Election Day. Thus this tendency to pick up on the most excited supporters may be a boon to pollsters immediately before an election but can make the polls buggy beforehand.I doubt this accounts for all or even most of the momentum shifts we are seeing much of which is probably real but I suspect it accounts for some of it. As I’ve mentioned previously I’d be especially cautious about polls conducted in the 24 or 48 hours after a candidate achieves a big “win” in a primary or in a debate especially if it is an automated survey.And if you’re a Republican voter who does have a favorite candidate I’d be even more cautious. If I were a Mitt Romney supporter for instance I’m not sure I’d be “rooting” for polls that showed Mr. Romney ahead in Ohio right now — something we have not seen yet but may see soon. That could set up exaggerated expectations for Mr. Romney in a state that is ultimately pretty tough for him and where his polls have usually lagged behind his national averages. Then if Mr. Romney goes on to lose the state — and we have seen a number of states revert to the mean implied by their demographics as the election draws near — he could be viewed as “blowing” the lead when he never had a firm grasp on it to begin with.Of course Mr. Romney benefited from this very pattern in Michigan a state where he had a dominant position in the polls until the final two weeks and an underwhelming win looked like a triumph.But if the pattern continues to repeat itself — polls alter and exaggerate expectations for a candidate leading to inevitable disappointment when he does not live up to them — we may see the see-saw patterns of momentum continue in the race.We’re going to continue publishing our forecasts — they are as useful a way to summarize the polls as anything else — but please regard them with caution and remember that those wide confidence intervals are there for a reason.
 0,“Pretty Woman” a musical adaptation of the 1990 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts will close in August after a year on Broadway the show announced Wednesday.With music and lyrics by the pop songwriters Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance the production was the latest effort to retool a hit movie for the stage. The show was capitalized for up to $17 million according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission but after a strong start the box office fell off considerably; the musical grossed $538552 for the week ending June 30 — only 39 percent of its potentia l.In a season that also included the adaptations of the movies “Beetlejuice” and “Tootsie” “Pretty Woman” which Jerry Mitchell directed was harshly reviewed and didn’t pick up any Tony Award nominations. At the time of its Aug. 18 closing it will have played 27 previews and 421 regular performances.From the start the musical faced an especially knotty challenge: how to modernize the movie’s male-savior plot for a post-#MeToo audience. Could Vivian the hooker with a heart of gold played by Ms. Roberts in the film be the savior this time around? Despite the feminist gloss the show still “hewed suffocatingly close to the film’s story gags and dialogue” Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The New York Times.
 9,Moody's Investors Service assigned a B2 rating yesterday to the preferred equity redemption culmulative stock or Percs of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation and it placed the $1.9 billion issue on its review list with the possibility of an upgrade.The Standard & Poor's Corporation meanwhile gave the issue a BB- rating and also said it would consider an upgrade.Moody's said the Percs had "strong equity characteristics" and noted that RJR Nabisco had stated that it hoped to exchange common stock for preferred.Moody's also said it wondered whether "this infusion of equity represents an enduring change in the orientation towards financial risk on the part of RJR Nabisco's management." RJR Nabisco has a large amount of high-interest debt outstanding.

 0,The 2008 Democratic primary battle between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton which concludes Tuesday with contests in Montana and South Dakota has developed such a reliable story line that pundits can recite it in their sleep.The first black and first woman with solid chances to win the White House have split the Democratic Party nearly in half with his coalition of young voters affluent liberals and blacks against her coalition of women older voters Hispanics and working-class whites. Mr. Obama appears on track to a narrow nomination victory if he can win over just a small fraction of the roughly 200 superdelegates who remain undecided.VideoBut that numbing familiarity cannot obscure what makes this nomination fight so singular. In its cost duration competitiveness and breadth of citizen involvement it stands alone in the history of American presidential politics.“We’ve had higher rates of participation not just by voting but by volunteering and giving than any other” said Michael J. Malbin executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute and a onetime Congressional aide to Dick Cheney when he was a congressman. “And there’s nothing that’s remotely close.”Read More …

 9,A United Airlines Boeing 767 carrying 116 people went into a dive to avoid a collision with a small plane passing within 100 feet of the smaller craft according to a report received by the Federal Aviation Administration.The 108 passengers and eight crew members aboard Flight 76 from Long Beach Municipal Airport to Chicago were not injured in the incident which occurred at 7:33 A.M. Sunday said Elly Brekke a spokeswoman for the agency.She said that the United pilot told the F.A.A. that he saw the single-engine Cessna in front of his aircraft so he dived to avoid it passing within 100 feet of the smaller craft Ms. Brekke said.Air traffic controllers advised the United pilot of the light plane's position but Ms. Brekke said she was not sure what role the warning played in avoiding a collision. The mishap occurred about five and a half miles southwest of the airport.

 9,PATERSON N.J. Jan. 1— When the Labor Department designated this city and sur irounding Bergen and Passaic Counties as an area of “sub stantial” unemployment this week it came as no surprise to Frank Kaster.Shifting from foot‐to‐foot waiting stolidly for the long line in which he was standing to inch its way up to the claims counter at the United States Employment Service office here Mr. Kaster explained how he had been out of work for “about nine or 10 weeks.”Though single he found it “rough” to live on an unem ployment insurance check of $69 a week and was puzzled as to why he had been laid off after eight years on the job at the Heller Candy Company.“I used to bring the stuff up on the elevator” he said “and I got laid off with a lot of other people. They never told us anything.”
 9,According to Mr. Greenwald Tatra's management desperate for sales after its market collapsed in Russia agreed to send 2500 trucks or more than half last year's production to Libya. The trucks were sent but the $52 million for them never arrived. With the help of lawyers most have been retrieved from points in Europe where they were sent before they would have gone to Libya."The company got ripped off bad" Mr. Rutherford said. "But we've got approximately 2000 back and we spiffed them up. We've moved about a thousand of them."More difficult for Mr. Greenwald and his partners are the deeper problems common to many manufacturers in the post-Communist era. Productivity is poor a combination of too many workers and apathetic work habits bred by the old system. And while labor is comparatively cheap -- most Tatra workers earn under $200 a month -- Mr. Greenwald said this advantage would not last."We do need to get on with improved productivity and quality" he said. 1666 Workers DismissedTo that end the company dismissed 1666 workers last month. Three years ago it had 14000 employees or one for every truck produced. Now it has 9000.To get what he needs from suppliers Mr. Greenwald has had to negotiate with Czech banks for $25 million so Tatra could pay its bills. Once the suppliers start shipping Mr. Greenwald said he is confident they will gradually shift to the more efficient just-in-time system of delivery a side benefit from a recent investment by Volkswagen A.G. Germany's largest auto maker in the giant Skoda automobile plant 40 miles northeast of Prague.Already he said Volkswagen is working with Czech suppliers on just-in-time delivery the system conceived by the Japanese and now common in Western auto plants. In contrast to the Communist way just-in-time delivery lets parts arrive at a plant as needed rather than in huge orders that build inventory. Motivation a ChallengePerhaps most challenging of all to the Americans will be motivating Czech workers and management many of whom seem battered by years of Communism and the last three years of an unsuccessful transition.

 0,When Matt Damon did his Brett Kavanaugh imitation on “Saturday Night Live” you could tell that he nailed it before he said a word. It was all about the face — that sneering rage-filled scowl. Kavanaugh didn’t sound like a judge at his Senate hearing last week  let alone a potential Supreme Court justice; he didn’t even manage to look like one.But then again Lindsey Graham who went through the hearing with pretty much the same expression on his face didn’t look much like a senator either.There have been many studies of the forces driving Trump support and in particular the rage that is so pervasive a feature of the MAGA movement. What Thursday’s hearing drove home however was that white male rage isn’t restricted to blue-collar guys in diners. It’s also present among people who’ve done very well in life’s lottery whom you would normally consider very much part of the elite.In other words hatred can go along with high income and all too often does.At this point there’s overwhelming evidence against the “economic anxiety” hypothesis — the notion that people voted for Donald Trump because they had been hurt by globalization. In fact people who were doing well financially were just as likely to support Trump as people who were doing badly.

 0,As a special treat for readers of The Moment the power gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin writes about new exhibitions in Paris.Yesterday night was the opening of the “La Louvre – Paris” exhibition by Gelitin the four-man art collective at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (ARC). The Museum was packed. A fashiony and artsy crowd was hanging out at the entrance and inside the museum.The group known as Gelitin from Vienna took over an entire floor of the museum. They filled the space that the museum gave them with more than 3000 artworks from big installations to small pieces exhibited from the floor to ceiling. Broken walls toilets photographs of men half naked piles of chairs pipes stuffed animals real birds — this is the world of Gelitin. A whole room is filled with paintings made with modeling clay: a re-visitation of masterpieces referencing Paris: La Joconde (Leonardo da Vinci) etc. See above.A large band of artistic friends took part in the creation of some works. After being overwhelmed by the vision of all these works (paintings sculptures installation drawings knitting works photos.) I started to detect the smell of caramel and cheese which were used to make some of the works on display. Cheese like caramel was coated on to a sculpture: the smell was very strong as the room was getting warmer and full of visitors.The world of Gelitin could be defined as an enormous extravagant chaotic and proliferating universe. It is difficult to describe the work with a few adjectives. I am very enthusiastic with this exhibition and its dynamic colorful unpredictable and unique in its style. I was leaving the museum while a band was performing in front of an extravagant and flamboyant crowd.“La Louvre – Paris” Musée de la ville de Paris exhibition on view from March 1st to April 20th 2008.
 0,Some restaurants stand at unusual culinary crossroads. Metropol stands at an unusual cartographical one.It faces the intersection of two numbered streets that sound to the uninitiated as if they should be parallel to each other and about a quarter mile apart. But West Fourth and West 10th do indeed meet an asterisklike exception to Manhattan's usually tidy grid an anomaly that happens to be Metropol's address.The restaurant itself represents a more typical convergence.It's part bistro part brasserie those terms and genres being so thoroughly confused and conflated in New York these days. Globe-shaped lighting fixtures dangle from a pressed tin ceiling. A distressed mirror dominates one broad wall.To those vintage flourishes Metropol weds the semiotics of a certain kind and era of downtown Manhattan cool. There are enormous black-and-white photographs of Edie Sedgwick Andy Warhol Nico. There's a thick cover of darkness.

 9,When mothers in the United States Sweden and Russia nuzzle their infants and croon baby talk they are giving their babies a lot more than tender loving care scientists have found. The women are producing highly exaggerated speech sounds that provide the basis for all subsequent learning of that language.Baby talk is much more important than people realize said Dr. Patricia Kuhl chairwoman of speech and hearing sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle and the lead author of a new report on the university of ''parentese'' -- the sing-song exaggerated speech pattern that people use when talking to infants.''Parentese has a melody to it'' Dr. Kuhl said. ''And inside this melody is a tutorial for the baby which contains exceptionally well-formed versions of the building blocks of language.''In a study published today in the journal Science Dr. Kuhl and her colleagues found that mothers in the the three countries stretched out or exaggerated the pronunciation of three primary vowels when speaking to their infants -- ''ee'' ''ah'' and ''oo'' -- which are common to every spoken language in the world. This vowel stretching tunes the infant's brain to the widest possible range of vowel sounds Dr. Kuhl said. As the baby learns the vowels of its mother tongue the ability to hear subtle vowel distinctions in other languages is gradually lost.
 0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this two-part lesson students first examine the United States electoral college system and understand it as it applies to the 2004 presidential election. They then learn about the twelve battleground states in this year’s election and predict election results.Author(s):Annissa Hambouz The New York Times Learning NetworkYasmin Chin Eisenhauer The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: Two one-hour class periodsObjectives:Students will:1. Express their understanding of the United States electoral process including the electoral college.2. Learn about the battleground states in the 2004 presidential election and the significance of their electoral votes by reading and discussing the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line.”3. Develop an informative pamphlet on the history function and controversy of the electoral college system.4. Investigate the political traditions history and potential impact of each of the twelve battleground states in the 2004 election by reading and discussing state-specific articles from The New York Times.5. Make election predictions for the battleground states as well as a general prediction for the election based on their battleground state predictions; compare predictions to the final election results.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils-paper-student journals-copies of the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041101monday.html (one per student)-resources on American electoral politics such as civics or government textbooks and encyclopedias-computers with Internet access-copies of each of the following articles (enough of each for 1/6 of the students):ArkansasColoradoFloridaIowaMichiganMinnesotaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoOhioPennsylvaniaWisconsinActivities / Procedures:DAY ONE: UNDERSTANDING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt written on the board prior to class: “How are the President and Vice President of the United States elected? Jot down everything that you know about the process.” Allow students a few minutes to write and then have them share their responses briefly with the class. Depending on the level of the class students’ responses may range in understanding from popular votes to explaining the electoral college system. If students are unfamiliar with the electoral college be sure to define it. Discuss the following as a class: What do students know about the relationship between popular votes and electoral votes? How did this topic come up in the 2000 presidential election? What might be some of the benefits of the electoral college? Why might some perceive it as unfair? What is a battleground (or swing) state and how are they related to the electoral college and the candidates’ campaigns?2. As a class read and discuss the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line” (found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041101monday.html) using the following questions:a. How many states does the article refer to as “hard-fought”? What does this mean?b. What have the candidates done to campaign in these pivotal states?c. How many electoral votes are needed for a presidential candidate to win the election?d. How many electoral votes does each of the battleground states mentioned in the article have?e. Why might Ohio be considered a particularly important battleground state according to the article?f. What might pose a threat to John Kerry’s candidacy in Minnesota according to the article?g. How might the 2004 election prove to be more of a legal controversy than the 2000 election according to the article?3. Explain to students they will be working in groups to create parts of a class-wide pamphlet about the United States presidential and vice presidential electoral process to inform students their age who might not be familiar with the electoral college system. Divide the class into four groups and assign each one of the following topics to cover in the pamphlet (written on the board or copied on a handout for easier student access):GROUP ONE: HOW THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WORKS This group explains the difference between popular votes and electoral votes how electors are allotted to each state how electors are appointed and how and when electors cast their votes.GROUP TWO: HISTORY OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group examines the electoral college’s origins how the electoral process differs from the Constitutional Convention’s 1787 plan; Article II Section I of the Constitution; the 12th and 23rd Amendments to the Constitution; and disputed elections throughout history.GROUP THREE: THE DEBATE OVER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group addresses the controversy of the “winner take all” system arguments to abolish the college as well as arguments to defend the system.GROUP FOUR: THE FUTURE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group investigates proposals to reform the electoral college including direct elections proportional representation and the “national bonus plan” and the likelihood for abolition of or alteration to the system in the future.Using all available classroom resources groups research their pamphlet topics. Students should be sure to make note of the bibliographical information of the sources they use. Once groups have completed their research each group should type its section of the pamphlet in a predetermined font and font size. Each group’s section should take up approximately one column of a tri-fold pamphlet. Create the class pamphlet by folding a paper into thirds. The front of the pamphlet may be designed by a student. The next four columns should include the four groups’ works. The final column should provide bibliographical information. Completed pamphlets should be copied and distributed in a future class. (They may also be made available to other students.)4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Each student should view The New York Times 2004 Election Guide Interactive Graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/) which allows one to view a voter map of the United States geographically by number of electoral votes and by battleground status. (If home Internet access is not available the maps may be printed out and distributed to students). Using the information from the maps each student creates a chart listing the states deemed battleground states in the left column with the other columns detailing the number of electoral votes each state receives its current status as leaning toward one of the bipartisan candidates or as an unclear or swing state and the party for which state voted in the 2000 election. Then each student should write a journal entry analyzing how the information on these maps might be used to predict the outcome of the election.DAY TWO: BATTLEGROUND STATES AND PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class create the chart assigned for homework on the board and fill in only the names of the twelve battleground states (Arkansas Colorado Florida Iowa Michigan Minnesota Nevada New Hampshire New Mexico Ohio Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Leave the columns under the headings “Number of Electoral Votes” “Current Status” and “Party Voted for in 2000 Election” blank. When students enter class assign each a blank to fill in on the chart using the data they compiled for homework. Once the classroom board chart is complete have students compare it to their homework charts for discrepancies and then discuss their responses to the homework journal assignement.2. Divide class into six groups and assign each group two battleground states and their corresponding New York Times articles:ArkansasColoradoFloridaIowaMichiganMinnesotaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoOhioPennsylvaniaWisconsinEach group should read and discuss each of its two articles aloud and answer the following questions after reading each article (written on the board for easier student access):-What makes this a “battleground state” in the 2004 election?-What is this state’s particular political history or tradition?-What information provided in this article might provide a clue to which candidate might receive this state’s electoral votes?-Based on the predictors in the article how do you think this state will vote on November 2 2004?After groups have read their assigned articles and answered the questions on each state the class should reconvene to fill in a final column added onto the battleground states chart on the board titled “Prediction.” Each group should provide their prediction with a brief explanation. Based on the groups’ predictions for the twelve battleground states and the Interactive Graphic maps’ predictions for the other 38 states whom does the class predict will be the winner of the November 2 2004 election?3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students should follow the televised election coverage and evaluate whether the predictions for their assigned battleground states were accurate. In their journals students should analyze why their predictions were right or wrong as well as their reactions to the election results.Further Questions for Discussion:-In your opinion should the electoral college system be preserved abolished or changed? Why?-How did the 2000 election change the way Americans view the electoral system?-Do you think the Osama bin Laden tape mentioned in the article will have an impact on the election? If so how? If not why not?-Why do you think so many of the so-called “swing” states are in the Midwest?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on journal responses contributions to the class electoral college pamphlet participation in group discussions well-informed battleground state and election predictions and thoughtful response to the outcome of the 2004 election.Vocabulary:intensity tinglingly deployed stump furor trending conservatism wooing troika third-party hairbreadth treacherousExtension Activities:1. In the 2004 Election Guide interactive graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/) The New York Times addresses the “Nader Factor” or those states where Independent and Reform parties candidate Ralph Nader has been included on or blocked from the ballot. Research the controversy and litigation around Mr. Nader’s candidacy and write an article for your school’s newspaper about his role in the race for the White House.2. On November 6 2001 U.S. Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) introduced three new pieces of electoral reform legislation to the House of Representatives. Investigate these bills and create a chart tracing the progress of each from its introduction to the present time. Then offer your opinion about each of these bills.3. With terms such as “battleground” and “the ground war” as examples from the American political vocabulary brainstorm as many war metaphors as you can. Compile the list into glossary of war metaphors (which can be expanded upon using different themes such as sports or nature) with definitions and examples of usage for each.4. Using the 2000 election as an example create mock television news coverage for the other instances in United States history in which the electoral college votes differed from the popular votes. Had television existed in those times what issues or controversies surrounding the elections of 1824 1876 and 1888 would have made the news?5. During election week read The New York Times every day and analyze its balance of coverage of the candidates. Alternately create a headline timeline of articles related to a specific theme such as a specific candidate candidates’ views of one another key issues voting trends or personal reactions to the election. (To order The New York Times for your classroom click here.)Interdisciplinary Connections:Economics- How much did each candidate in the 2004 election spend on his campaign?

 0,“One franc” Mr. Aznavour said. “After that I was able to tell my friends I was better paid than Piaf.”In 1958 the French government lifted a longstanding ban on allowing some of Mr. Aznavour’s more explicit songs — like “Après l’Amour” which recounts the aftermath of an episode of lovemaking — on the radio. “I was the first to write about social issues like homosexuality” Mr. Aznavour told The Times in 2006 referring to his 1972 song “What Makes a Man?” “I find real subjects and translate them into song.”He returned to New York in 1963 and rented Carnegie Hall where he performed to a packed house. (Among those in the audience was Bob Dylan who later said it was one of the greatest live performances he had ever witnessed.) A triumphant world tour followed.Thereafter the United States became a second home. Mr. Aznavour performed all over the country often with Liza Minnelli. He became a fixture in Las Vegas for a time and there married Ulla Thorsell a former model in 1967. She was his third wife.Mr. Aznavour had six children. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.As a child Mr. Aznavour watched his father go broke feeding penniless Armenian refugees in his restaurant. As his fame grew he became a spokesman and fund-raiser for the Armenian cause. He organized help worldwide after an earthquake killed 45000 people in Armenia in 1988. And when the country broke away from the crumbling Soviet Union in 1991 it made him an unofficial ambassador. He displayed the Corps Diplomatique plaque on his car as proudly as he wore the French Legion of Honor ribbon in his lapel.
 9,The Pentagon is seeking civilian advice on how to use new tests that screen blood for exposure to acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS officials said today.The request is raising concern among some homosexual rights organizations that say the armed services might use the test to try to identify homosexuals and remove them from military service.But the Pentagon's health affairs office which requested the evaluation said today that it was not considering any proposal to screen all recruits or all those in the services. David Newhall 3d principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for health affairs said the evaluation of the tests was ''absolutely not'' intended as a device to identify homosexuals in the service.Defense Department policy declares ''Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.'' Thus individuals can be discharged for homosexual activity or for an admission of homosexuality.

 0,"Chris was the core of this house -- everybody looked up to him" said Firefighter Mark Klinger who had worked with Firefighter Engeldrum for the last five years."An excellent firefighter a good father a good friend" Firefighter Klinger added. "That's all I can say."Firefighter Engeldrum had completed his service with the National Guard but re-enlisted. He did so his colleagues said in outrage at the Sept. 11 attack. "It had an effect on him" said Lt. Brian Horton of Ladder Company 61. "His country was attacked he was a soldier and he wanted to defend it."Firefighter Engeldrum is survived by his wife Sharon and his two sons: Sean 18 and Royce 16. Royce's birthday fire officials said was the day his father died.The firefighter last spoke with his family the night before Thanksgiving."He was glad to hear my voice" Mrs. Engeldrum recalled. "He was tired. He couldn't talk. He was going out on a mission. He just called to see if everything was O.K. here."At City Hall Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised Firefighter Engeldrum for having served not only in the Fire Department but also in the Police Department. "Christian Engeldrum spent his life protecting the people of this city and protecting democracy" the mayor said. "As a firefighter a police officer and a decorated member of our military there was no risk he wasn't willing to take for his fellow New Yorkers and his fellow Americans."Thirty city firefighters are on active duty overseas.

 9,In the 1980's a new generation of Chinese film makers won international respect for works that were innovative and visually stunning among them "Ju Dou" which was nominated for an Academy Award this year. But this summer's movies particularly three that are strongly backed by the Government and the army have a Maoist tinge that apparently is the wave of the future in Chinese arts at least as long as the present leaders are in power.The most important of the movies is Part 1 of "Decisive Battles" probably the costliest film ever made by a Chinese studio. Parts 2 and 3 are to come out later this year. The trilogy depicting battles in 1948 and 1949 that let the Communists take power is said to be the pet project of China's 84-year-old President Yang Shangkun. Not surprisingly Mr. Yang is a dashing young man in the movie. 125000 ExtrasPart 1 is three and a half hours of battle scenes interspersed with glowing portrayals of most of China's present leaders. There are no compelling characters but there are a lot of non-compelling ones: the Army provided 125000 soldiers for battles scenes. The trilogy is believed to have cost the Army more than $15 million -- reportedly more than all the 100 other films that China produces annually.A shorter summer epic is "Kaitian Pidi" which was officially translated as "An Epoch-Making Event" but which translates more literally as "The Creation of the Heavens and the Earth." The topic is the Communist Genesis: the forming of the Chinese Communist Party.The third of the trio is "Mao Zedong and His Son" which deals with Mao's grief when he lost his son to an American air raid in the Korean War. The film is unusual in that it portrays Mao as a human rather than a god. Though it is clearly propaganda with anti-American overtones it leaves many Chinese in tears. For all his unchallenged political power Mao is unable to break the news of his son's death to the son's wife.

 9,Some Metropolitan Opera subscribers saw red when they received their subscription renewal notices last week. Prices for most of the Met's 3800 seats were raised the customary few dollars roughly 6 percent. But some seats in the orchestra section -- about 100 for each performance said Joseph Volpe the company's general director -- have had their prices more than doubled as the section has been reconfigured.One irate subscriber who paid $513 for a nine-opera series this year was billed $1053 for the same seat next season. Another who over the last 20 years has gradually improved his seats within his price range discovered that the seats he has held the last few seasons have been redefined.As Mr. Volpe explained it the seats in the orchestra section under the balconies both on the sides and at the back have always been discounted because the overhang intrudes on the view of the top of the proscenium (though not of the stage). But in the last three years the Met has been whittling away at the discounted section. Borderline seats from which the view is not blocked are now considered prime orchestra seats.Next season those seats will be $100 on weeknights $117 on Saturdays. The seats under the side overhangs and just behind the prime orchestra section will be $70 on weeknights and $80 on Saturdays and those at the back of the house will be $55 and $60. The least expensive balcony seats will go for $13 on subscription.

 9,Even before ABC's mini-series ''Amerika'' had begun production powerful foes were trying to keep it off the air. In 1985 the Kremlin warned ABC's Moscow bureau of possible reprisals if the show ran.Earlier this year United Nations officials criticized the seven-part series which is scheduled to begin Feb. 15 for portraying corrupt international peacekeeping forces joining the K.G.B. in a takeover of the United States. A number of religious and disarmament organizations have also opposed the series while Reed Irvine of the conservative group Accuracy in Media complained it made the Soviet occupiers seem too nice.Perhaps the biggest blow came last week when the Chrysler Corporation decided that its commercials keyed to the theme ''The Pride is Back - Born in America'' were inappropriate for a series about Soviet conquest. After viewing six hours of it Chrysler's chairman Lee A. Iacocca decided to cancel about $7 million worth of commercials.Chrysler was the largest sponsor but ABC officials vowed that the show would go on. Meanwhile the Soviets who have denounced ''Amerika'' as ''psychological warfare'' are offering to buy it for Soviet television apparently as an example of American propaganda.
 9,Got that?It is the Republican-turned-Democrat vs. the Democrat-turned-Republican in heavily Republican Suffolk County and even Mr. Bianchi and Ms. Mazzarelli acknowledge that their campaigns are known less for the issues than for political intrigue.Ms. Mazzarelli calls Mr. Bianchi a hologram and a puppet. Mr. Bianchi says his challenger is an opportunist. Advertisements by the Republican State Committee say ''Vote No on Debra Mazzarelli'' without ever mentioning that Mr. Bianchi is its man.''I'm a Democrat with a little 'd' not a New York City D'' Mr. Bianchi said in a telephone interview from his home in Bellport. ''My voting record is not that different not that far off from the Republican positions.''Ms. Mazzarelli of Patchogue is a former telephone union worker who was picked in 1994 by John Powell the Republican county leader to challenge Mr. Bianchi. With the powerful Republican apparatus behind her the previously unknown Ms. Mazzarelli sent Mr. Bianchi back to tend to his orchids.Now after being re-elected in 1996 as a Republican she faces her first challenge as a Democrat.''The Republican Party has been influenced by the extreme right'' she said of her decision to jump ship to the Democrats. ''The litmus test for a good Republican is being anti-choice and I couldn't go for that. The Republican Party is not standing up for women or working-class people.''

 0,A separate lawsuit was filed last year against Exxon Mobil by Riverkeeper for violation of the federal environmental laws and City Councilmen David Yassky of Brooklyn and Eric Gioia of Queens who represent the communities along Newtown Creek expect to join it. But Mr. Gioia said last week said he wanted more exploratory holes drilled on the Queens side of Newtown Creek to help determine if more homeowners should seek legal action."The toxins from this spill have had a half-century to seep under the creek degrade our waterways and ruin our land" Mr. Gioia said. "We need to do everything possible to ensure our residents are safe and sound from this looming environmental threat."Brian Dunphy a spokesman for Exxon Mobil said in a statement that company officials are "disappointed in the legal actions that have been initiated against our remediation activities at our former Brooklyn refinery and terminal site. We believe the assertions made by Riverkeeper and others are unfounded."Mr. Dunphy also said the company does not believe there are any "health or safety impacts" resulting from the spill which the company believes is far enough underground that local residents and businesses are not affected.Many Greenpoint residents however have mixed feelings about the lawsuits.Some say they have little faith that yet more legal action -- Exxon Mobil has been under a self-initiated consent order with the state Department of Environmental Conservation since 1990 -- will have any effect and state and local agencies have not intervened in the matter so far. Some are skeptical of the California-based Girardi & Keese noting that the law firm is not local and questioning its motives. And others are concerned that the new lawsuit and its attendant publicity will sink home prices that have been rising rapidly during the last few years."I'm not convinced that it's the right thing to do" said Helen Wus who lives over the spill but says she will not join the lawsuit. "What's going to happen inevitably is it's going to devalue our property. If I knew 20 years ago when I bought this house that there was so much oil under this house I would not have bought it."Not all Greenpoint residents are worried however. Adam LaTempa who lives on Apollo Street said he was not aware of the lawsuit and did not think his neighbors were preoccupied with Riverkeeper's findings.
 9,CARNEGIE HALL 1960 At 17 I came to New York. The dormitory Was higher than most buildings I'd ever Been in. I ate in a coffee shop Where people never looked at you Went on a tour of Bellevue Because it was a place like Lindy's Or the Metropolitan Museum of Art So legendary that being there was magic. Some New York kids I met said "Let's go to Carnegie Hall." From Standing Room We looked down at the Philharmonic And their TV-star conductor jumping Up and down on his podium all creating Wonderful noise that filled the place And vibrated to the roots of my hair. The things you could take for granted in New York! -- LEWIS GARDNERON one of those frequent rainy April mornings Rose E. Baker of Woodlawn N.Y. is dashing to work wearing her nurse's whites. Glancing down the subway stairs she sees copper-colored water swirling at the bottom step. She hesitates for a moment or two considering whether to suffer wet feet all day or to retreat. Just then a man in high rubber boots approaches her."Do you want a lift?" he asks.At first Ms. Baker does not quite understand his question. But then the fellow turns his back bends over and says "Hop up!" She does and rides piggy-back all the way to the turnstile.Delighted to have dry feet but embarrassed nevertheless she thanks him profusely. He nods and moves on to the second flight of stairs. When Ms. Baker peers down she sees still more flood waters and her subway Sir Raleigh waiting on the bottom step.
 0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students learn about the dangers of various geographical locations and the threat they pose to humans and other living things.Author(s):Rachel Klein The New York Times Learning NetworkJavaid Khan The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Hypothesize how the whales in the picture accompanying the New York Times article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts” became beached.2. Learn about why pilot whales were recently beached at Cape Cod by reading and discussing the article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts.”3. Consider the features of Cape Cod that make it dangerous for the whales; in groups research dangerous geographical locations; brainstorm newspaper front pages on occurances at these locations.4. Individually contribute to their groups’ front pages; assemble and display front pages.Resources / Materials:-large photograph or transparency of beached whales from the New York Times article that accompanies this lesson-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts” (one per student)-research materials about dangerous places around the world (encyclopedias geography textbooks computers with Internet access)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: On an overhead project the image that accompanies the New York Times article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts”. Students respond to the following journal prompt (written on the board prior to class): “How do you think these whales ended up on the beach?” After giving students a few minutes to make their hypotheses have some students share their ideas with the class. Write hypotheses on the classroom board so that students can later compare their ideas to the explanations in the article.2. As a class read and discuss the article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts” focusing on the following questions:a. What happened at Cape Cod on July 30 2002? What event followed the next day?b. What did veterinarians begin to do once they decided that the whales would not make it back to the ocean?c. What is “the curse” of Cape Cod?d. What noise informed rescuers that the whales were heading back to sea?e. What was the beach like where the whales were first beached? What was the second beach like?f. What bothered David Brand about the rescue effort?g. What were some of the physical signs that the whales were dying?3. On the board write the phrase “The Curse of Cape Cod.” Using the article as a reference create a list as a class of the geographical features that make Cape Cod a dangerous place for whales. After listing these features divide the class into groups of three or four assigning each group another famous geographical location that has a “curse” (meaning that it is difficult to navigate or traverse and poses a danger to humans and/or animals). Locations may include The Bermuda Triangle the Afghan hills Siberia Antarctica Mount Everest and Death Valley. Each group researches their assigned location in order to answer the following questions (written on the board for easier student access):–What are the geographical peculiarities that make this location dangerous? (E.g. terrain physical shape climate location relative to other places)–What famous event(s) has/have happened there that illustrate(s) these dangers? (The event may focus on the danger posed by the location to either animals or humans or both.)Each group then brainstorms a newspaper front page that contains specific information about the dangers of this location a story about a dangerous event or events that occurred at this location and pictures of the location itself and the events. Groups should include at least as many articles as there are students in the group and should also include creative additions to the page such as an advertisement for a vacation to this location or a timeline of other historic events at this location. Prior to the end of class groups should divide the work among members assigning each member a specific task for homework.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: At home students complete their portions of the newspaper page. In a later class groups should assemble their pages. Finished newspaper pages can be displayed in the classroom.Further Questions for Discussion:–What would you do if you saw a beached whale? WWhat would you do?–How do you feel about the practice of writing “dead” on the whales?–Do you think that euthanizing the whales was the right thing to do? What other action do you think could have been taken and what do you think the results would have been?–Have you ever had a pet die? How did in make you feel?–Would you travel to a dangerous place? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on completion of journal participation in class and group discussions participation in group research and completion of newspaper front page.Vocabulary:scores euthanize peninsula sonar marooned voracious Samaritans phalanx douse brigade lesionsExtension Activities:1. Learn about international laws regarding the hunting and killing of exotic or endangered animals for human consumption. Are some animals forbidden in some countries but permitted in others? When did these laws come into effect? What has been the effect on the animals protected by the laws? Write an article for your school or local paper to heighten community awareness of this issue.2. Stage a class debate on the topic of animal euthanasia. How is it different from human euthanasia? Do humans have the right to decide when an animal should die? How should this point be determined?3. Research the various types and sizes of whale populations throughout the world. Create a map charting each population. Also include information on the risks posed to the different populations such as climate hunting and disease.4. Write a short story entitled “The Curse of Cape Cod” (or another famous location). In your story focus on how the location itself affects the people and other living things there leading to disastrous results.Interdisciplinary Connections:Global Studies- Learn about the ways that different cultures prepare their dead. What rites and rituals are performed? What physical signs are provided to show that a person has passed on? How are bodies buried or otherwise treated? Write a paper about the cultural practices you find most interesting.Social Studies- The article cites the whales’ “follow the leader” social structure as a reason for the mass beaching at Cape Cod. Create a documentary about adolescent human “follow the leader” social structure and the dangers that can ensue. You might even experiment with making the documentary in the style of a nature film representing the human subjects as “animals.”Science- Learn about another species whose behavior sometimes works against its own survival such as lemmings or salmon. Create a poster illustrating how this behavior works and why this species engages in it.Technology- Create a Web site featuring the location you researched in the main activity. Include pictures interactive sections (e.g. “Navigate a plane through the Bermuda Triangle”) and other interesting information.Other Information on the Web:Cape Cod Stranding Network (//www.capecodstranding.net/) offers information about how to get involved related links and recent cases.International Fund for Animal Welfare (//www.ifaw.org) promotes and ensures the just and kind treatment of animals as sentient beings.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Geography Standard 7- Knows the physical processes that shape patterns on Earth’s surface.

 9,After the Federal agents finished their intensive search after the Ted Koppel town meeting after the small army of reporters had gone and without a single television camera left to record the event the women here did what they always do when someone is in trouble: they put on a fund-raising supper.It was held tonight at the Lamotte Township Fire Hall as such suppers usually are but this time it was not for anyone they knew. It was for the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing.In the past week similar fund-raisers have undoubtedly been organized in thousands of small towns across America. But Decker a conservative Republican area about 100 miles north of Detroit in Michigan's rural "thumb" region and has one post office one bar and 90 people is not just another sleepy small community anymore. It is the place where James and Terry Nichols who are being held as material witnesses in the Oklahoma City bombing are accused of conspiring to make explosives with Timothy McVeigh the primary suspect in the blast in Oklahoma City.In its own way the fund-raising supper tells more about places like Decker than all the television specials and the camera crews that have flooded the area since Federal agents blocked off the Nichols farm and began searching for explosives. If there were members of paramilitary groups present they didn't call attention to themselves. There were quite a few farmers dressed in work clothes who had driven through high winds and a cold rain.

 0,India's economy continued to be one of the fastest growing in the world swelling 8.2 percent in the year ended in March the country's most rapid pace of growth in a decade and a half.''The economy grew a shade lower than our expectations but still outperformed every economy other than China's'' said Mahesh Vyas chief executive of the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy an independent research group based in Mumbai.In the most recent quarter the economy slowed to a pace of 8.2 percent in a year-over-year comparison from the 10.5 percent rate posted in the previous quarter.Mr. Vyas and other experts said they expected the rapid growth to continue this year aided by the booming services and industrial sectors.
 0,Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ramon Vazquez had two homers and seven runs batted in apiece for the Rangers. Amazingly they were the team’s Nos. 8 and 9 hitters and finished the season with only 11 and eight homers.“Tonight there were some balls thrown across the plate and we put them in play” Manager Ron Washington told The Associated Press in the understatement of the century.As for the Rangers’ bullpen Wes Littleton came in for the final three innings and earned … a save? Yes in the rare cases when a pitcher finishes a game throwing three or more innings he is eligible for a save no matter what the game’s margin. Even Jose Reyes could probably have earned that one.Horrifyingly the O’s had to come back and play a second game of a doubleheader just after. They lost that one too 9-7.

 9,Trying to Save a NephewWhile Dying of AIDS'A Not So Quiet Nocturne'Vineyard TheaterIn ''A Not So Quiet Nocturne'' by Jaye Austin Williams a deaf woman who has lost her husband and a baby daughter to AIDS and is herself dying of the disease decides that her great project before she dies is to save a teen-age nephew from the drugs and violence of the streets. And in the Onyx Theater Company's production Michelle Banks with the simplest gestures and statements creates a character of almost unbearable emotional power.This company which specializes in theater by the deaf and presents plays in combinations of sign language and speech continues to set very high standards for innovation in making the whole range of human expression as available in silence as it is in voices.For this play which the author directs it needs all the ingenuity it can muster. Ms. Austin-Williams apparently cannot bear to leave out any detail of the life of any character and there are many. As both author and director she also seems to approach the story thinking of movies more than plays. There are more than 40 short scenes in less than two hours with blackouts every two minutes or so while stagehands shift large objects around in the shadows. It is like having furniture movers constantly interrupting an intense emotional confrontation.So it is a tribute to this large and buoyant cast that the play's central idea -- that life's richest times are brief and quiet -- comes through so memorably.

Yesterday Folger the nation's second largest roaster after the General Foods Corporation trimmed 20 cents from the wholesale price to $3.98 a pound.Folger which is a division of the Procter & Gamble Company became the first major roaster to roll back the price since a July 1975 frost destroyed three‐quarters of Brazil's crop with its first cut of 25 cents a pound on May 12. Before the cut the price was at an all‐time record level of $4.46 a pound.The drop in Folger's list price reflected “declines in imported green coffee prices during the past several weeks” a Folger spokesman said. In White Plains a spokesman for the General Foods Corporation denied reports that the company planned to cut coffee prices.Lockheed Forms UnitThe Lockheed Aircraft Corporation said it formed a new subsidiary the Lockheed Finance Corporation to assist customers in arranging credit for Lockheed products.

 9,FROM the mid-1970's to the mid-80's museum exhibitions of corporate art collections were nearly commonplace. But they are rare today and it is not because business has lost interest in the subject.Far from it. In the last decade the number of companies acquiring art has gone from 300 to about 1200 according to the Directory of Corporate Art Collections.Still it seems that more corporations are keeping their art at home for the edification of their employees and for visiting clients. Whatever the reasons -- and no doubt the growing cost of insurance is one of them -- they have not deterred the 13 companies represented in "Corporations Collect I" at the Morris Museum.The most venerable lender is the chemicals manufacturer Ciba-Geigy which began acquiring in 1959 and now owns about 600 works. Initiated 10 years later the holdings of the Prudential Insurance Company now total more than 11000 items; the Chemical Bank has gathered 2000 pieces gathered over the same period. And in 20 years A.T.& T. has amassed 3500 works. As collectors the remaining corporations are Johnny-come-latelies but Schering-Plough and Nabisco maintain galleries that display New Jersey artists.
 9,Off scree this red-blooded American hero seems no larger than life -5-foot-10-inches and 167 pounds. But oh is he in shape. He said he spends three hours every morning working out with his stunt men in a gymnasium in his home in Rolling Hills Estates Calif. ''to maintain a certain youthful appearance.'' The workouts have not been in vain judging from the impressive figure he cuts in tight blue jeans and a red plaid cowboy shirt. He has longish blond hair with a fringe of bangs flopping over his forehead a blond mustache and a blond beard. Underneath all the hair he bears a somewhat craggy resemblance to Robert Redford.Why does he think he's become so popular with audiences? ''Well my films do deal with certain positive things'' he said. ''The endings are always positive. I think a lot of people are tired of depressing boring films. I think they like to feel good at the end of a film. One of the biggest thrills of my life came when I went to a theater to see 'Missing in Action' and all the people stood up and applauded at the end. That's when my character brings some P.O.W.'s he's just rescued to a conference in Saigon where the politicians are saying there aren't any more prisoners of war.''Talk like that brings forth memories of John Wayne anbd Charles Bronson as well as Sylvester Stallone as Rambo. Asked if he's as patriotic as the characters he has played Mr. Norris crosses his left foot shod in a gray ostrich-skin cowboy boot over his right knee and replies: ''I am a conservative a real flag waver a big Ronald Reagan fan. I'm not so much a Republican or Democrat; I go more for the man himself. Ronald Reagan says what he thinks he's not afraid to speak his mind even if he may be unpopular. I want a strong leader and he is a strong leader. And ever since he has been in office there has been a more positive patriotic feeling in this country.''Mr. Norris said he thought there was a big difference between ''Missing in Action'' and Mr. Stallone's recent ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' in which Rambo also rescues some prisoners of war. ''I'm not quite as anti-Government as Rambo is'' he said. ''When the helicopter comes to rescue Rambo and the American M.I.A. and then leaves them stranded I found that unrealistic. There is not an American pilot alive who would leave them there. They'd have to shoot me to stop me from picking them up because I'd be dead inside if I didn't.''He added that he had made ''Missing in Action'' and its sequel ''Missing in Action 2: The Beginning'' as a tribute to his younger brother Wieland who died in Vietnam in 1970 while leading a squad of soldiers on patrol in the jungle. ''Vietnam was a tragic mistake'' he said. ''If you don't want to win the battle don't get involved.''Mr. Norris born Carlos Ray Norris said he grew up under the influence of the movies of John Wayne whom he regarded as his ''substitute father'' after his own Cherokee father an alcoholic left the family's home in Ryan Okla. when he was 10. His Irish-English mother later moved the family of three boys to Torrance Calif.
 0,Just over two weeks ago the Devils’ season appeared to be unraveling.After losing at home to the Islanders 1-0 on Nov. 16 the Devils were in the Atlantic Division basement with a 7-10-2 record. They had scored only 42 goals in their first 19 games — an average of 2.2 a game — and had lost three straight games as Martin Brodeur was attempting to notch his 500th career victory. (Listen as Marty discusses his milestone here.)I had watched the Rangers defeat the Devils at the new arena in Newark on Nov. 14 in a way I had never seen — with patience and opportunistic scoring formerly a Devils trademark! With Scott Gomez and Brian Rafalski lost to free agency and with Brodeur another year older and possibly a little slower it was getting easy to believe that the Devils were a team in decline and looking at a season that was only going to get worse.So what happened? After shutting out the Canadiens 4-0 Friday the Devils had won their sixth game in a row and were only four points out of first place in the division!While six games does not make a season it is clear that this team cannot be counted out. Brodeur has been in net for all six games allowing only seven goals and recording two shutouts. Zach Parise (7 goals 6 assists) and Brian Gionta (5 goals 5 assists) along with Jamie Langenbrunner (9 assists) have given a huge lift to an offense that has scored 22 goals during the six-game streak.Were you one of the ones ready to count out the Devils? Do you think they will continue to improve as the season goes on? Will they win another division title?

 0,Ending a conflict over the fate of a forest rich in both wood and wildlife loggers biologists and the government of Gabon have agreed to keep bulldozers and chain saws out of a 1900-square-mile reserve with the highest density of large mammals ever recorded in a tropical rain forest.The deal includes a slight redrawing of the boundaries of Gabon's Lope Reserve subtracting 400 square miles of land on the southeastern flank that holds the richest stands of valuable okoume trees and adding about 200 square miles of previously unprotected terrain that includes remote upland forests that have only rarely if ever felt the footfall of a human.Several biologists working in the region say the net loss of land is worth it. The area opened to logging had been farmed less than 200 years ago and so is relatively recent growth. In contrast they say the newly protected area which was to have been cut by Malaysian and French companies is a priceless reservoir of biological riches that is thought to have been essentially undisturbed for the last 10000 years.More important they say the agreement -- signed last month by the country's major logging companies the government and a variety of private environmental groups -- finally brings meaning to the word reserve with the government and loggers committing for the first time never to violate the new boundaries.

 0,Kevin SpragueThere are some people you feel can never surprise you you know them so well. You’ve spent hours in their company you know all their little habits you even hear what they’re going to say before they say it. And then every so often (and it could be the 20th encounter) one of them does something that knocks you for a loop and you think “I never really knew you at all.”I’m talking about Hedda and Hamlet Nora and Blanche even the child-murdering Richard. These are figures from classical theater who show up with numbing regularity in the life of a drama critic. (I feel like I’ve hung out more with Hamlet than I have with my closest friends in recent years.)Mostly they hew true to anticipated form albeit with varying degrees of polish and depth. But just once in a while an actor or actress will shake your preconceptions to the core. That’s when it’s time bring out an adjective that’s been so overused it’s nearly lost its value: revelatory. Because what these performers do is make you see the familiar in new ways.These reflections are occasioned most immediately by Shakespeare & Company’s production of “Richard III” starring John Douglas Thompson in Lenox Mass. I’ve seen at least a dozen Richards in my life some of them highly accomplished and quite different from one another. But I’ve never seen one with less noticeable psychological shading than that of Mr. Thompson and I mean that as a compliment.A richly emotional leading man in “Othello” and “The Emperor Jones” in recent years Mr. Thompson could certainly deliver a textbook-sharp version of a psychologically maimed Richard. But the boldness of his performance lies in his choosing to play the crookback king as someone who never lets his consciousness get the better of him. He lives as it were in the moment in an exceedingly bloody and dangerous time. Self-reflection (and especially conscience) can make a man hesitate and hesitation is suicide in the warring divided England of “Richard III.”Ever-moving and ever-unregarding Mr. Thompson was in a sense history incarnate. (In his refusal to court self-awareness he also reminded me of many a super-successful professional I’ve known. Don’t ever believe anyone who says nice guys finish first.) And “Richard III” as above all a history play suddenly made fresh sense to me.In my tenure as a chief theater critic at the Times Janet McTeer was probably the first performer to make me rethink a classic character altogether. In 1996 Ms. McTeer came to Broadway as Nora in Anthony Page’s production of Ibsen’s “Doll’s House.” On the surface she didn’t fit the part at all. She’s a tall commanding even muscular woman someone you might like to have on your pick-up basketball team. In other words she’s nobody’s doll.Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesAnd that was exactly why she was such a real and heartbreaking Nora. There was nothing of the child-like geisha bride about her. She had to assume the role like a costume that didn’t fit even bending her knees so that this Nora could appear shorter than her husband when he kissed her. Her Nora in other words was behaving unnaturally but she had convinced herself and everyone else that this was the way she was meant to be. Ibsen’s notions of social roles that confine people had never seemed clearer or more viscerally felt.Another ostensibly miscast actor was Simon Russell Beale in the title role of “Hamlet.” I grew up with visions of the melancholy Dane as the coolest guy on campus: handsome long-haired rebellious and of course always dressed in black — the beatnik (or hippie or punk) that all the girls swooned for. Mr. Russell Beale does not fit anyone’s idea of a romantic cooler-than-thou brooder. He’s short chubby round-faced and middle-aged well before middle age with no obvious attributes of leading-man glamour.But in John Caird’s production for the Royal Shakespeare Company (which I saw a few times at the beginning of this century) Mr. Russell Beale became as close to a definitive Hamlet as I’m ever likely to see. (First runner-up: Mark Rylance another less-than-obvious candidate.) That’s because he registers thought more transparently and intricately than any actor of his generation. And every one of those “words words words” that Hamlet speaks visibly connected to not just an idea but also an instinctive emotion in this prince’s mind.For once I was able to follow Hamlet all the way through his long journey of vacillations and convolutions of character. By the end he had achieved a marveling but credible acceptance of who he was and how he had got there. I wept for him not because he was a classic tragic paradigm but because he had become something like a close friend. Or maybe even closer. I don’t think I was the only person who left that performance thinking “Hamlet c’est moi.”The list of other performances that fall into this category is short (and it should be). They include Cate Blanchett’s Blanche in “A Streetcar Named Desire” Kate Burton’s Hedda Gabler and Lauren Ambrose’s Juliet. They aren’t necessarily among the very greatest performances I’ve ever seen (though Mr. Russell Beale’s Hamlet and Ms. Blanchett’s Blanche qualify in that respect too).Sometimes a deeply felt classical reading is the best of all as in Christopher Plummer’s ravishing King Lear. But I reserve a special chamber of my memory for those actors and actresses who made me look anew at old acquaintances. So I imagine do you and I’m eager to hear your examples.
 9,The New Jersey Nets issued their first and only formal punishment of Coach John Calipari today giving him a letter of reprimand for his profane ethnic insult of a reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark.The Nets' chairman Henry Taub and the team president Michael Rowe met with Calipari the coach and director of basketball operations for two hours this morning during which the incident was discussed and the letter delivered. It was the club's first official action since the incident on March 20 when Calipari using a profanity called Garcia a ''Mexican idiot.''However the team did not impose an additional fine on Calipari. Last week Calipari was fined a record $25000 by Commissioner David Stern a move that may have been prompted by the Nets' inaction. The team's handling of the incident has been the subject of widespread criticism in the news media. ''We met today and everyone was very frank and honest'' Calipari said after practice today. ''It was fair. I embarrassed the organization. But I think they understand who I am and what I'm all about. A lot of things were discussed. But obviously this last week's events were stressed a lot.''During the meeting there was no apparent move to force Calipari to relinquish some of his power and control that he asked for and received when he signed a five-year $15 million deal with the Nets in June. Someone close to the situation said the matter had been discussed among some of the owners but there was little the organization could do to take back any of the control they had given him in his contract. ''Management reviewed possible courses of action that were left to be taken''

 0,To the Editor:Despite the crushing defeat suffered by rebel forces at the Battle of Long Island (news article Aug. 25) New York City was nonetheless home to many important victories on the road to independence and freedom.Historians have long attributed the principle of freedom of the press in America to the victorious trial of John Peter Zenger owner of The New York Weekly Journal in 1735 for ''seditious libels'' against the state.In 1770 two months before the Boston Massacre American blood was spilled on John Street in the Battle of Golden Hill when citizens and the Sons of Liberty battled British troops.And until World War I New Yorkers celebrated Evacuation Day every year to commemorate the British departure from the city at the end of the Revolution.

 9,Dr. Crew said he would appeal yesterday's ruling as he will the one handed down on April 23 when Justice Douglas E. McKeon of State Supreme Court in the Bronx ruled that Dr. Crew had exceeded his authority in suspending members of District 7.As a practical matter there will be no immediate effect from yesterday's ruling. Members of both boards remain locked out of their offices pending Dr. Crew's appeal and regardless of the suspensions board members can run for re-election next Tuesday which several are doing. While the two rulings were parallel in the sense that both held that Dr. Crew had gone beyond the powers of his office in suspending the boards in February they were strikingly different in tone.In last week's decision Justice McKeon said that the Chancellor had hurt some innocent people when he removed all nine board members in District 7 and that Dr. Crew seemed to have been motivated more by a television program exploring political activities in the district than by the plight of the district's 15000 children.In yesterday's decision on District 9 Justice Crispino hinted strongly that his ruling might have been different if Dr. Crew had submitted to him a just-completed report on corruption in District 9 and he suggested that the report could be a basis for future action against the board.Justice Crispino focused on Carmelo Saez Jr. the president of the nine-member District 9 board who has been repeatedly accused of corruptly using his position and presiding over the district as though it were his political fief.

 9,AS channel surfers glide through the airwaves of Storer Cable of New Haven they might see "Men's Christian Basketball" "Islamic Insights" or "Melting Fishbowl" a local arts program. Other options include "Live Pet of the Week" "Underground News" "American Atheist News" and "Healthy Child Happy Child."This offbeat range of public access television shows is broadcast by Citizens TV or CTV on Channels 29 and 33. Today it is adding a third public access channel on 28 as a result of rebuilding its system. The three channels provide public access educational and governmental programming 24 hours a day seven days a week. All their programs are produced by amateurs with training provided by CTV; the production staff is all volunteer.The New Haven public access operation has been underwritten since 1989 by Storer Cable as part of a refranchising agreement. While all 24 cable franchises provide public access operations only Storer and TCI Cablevision of Central Connecticut have sophisticated independent studios said Beryl M. Lyons a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Utility Control the state agency that oversees cable television systems.More of the remaining cable franchises will probably be providing similar operations as their original franchising agreements expire Ms. Lyons said. "As these companies come up for franchise renewals one of the things that we look at very closely is their commitment to public access" she said. "We're looking at it more and more and making certain that the companies are putting their commitment there." Dollars Related to Size of Franchise

 9,HONDA ACCORD EX V6 Honda's bread-and-butter midsize car just keeps getting better. Like the boomers who've been buying it for more than 20 years it has matured and expanded trading youthful exuberance for staid middle age.The latest sixth-generation Accord introduced last fall is significant in many ways: It is longer taller significantly roomier and more powerful than the previous car. This Accord was designed specifically for American tastes and it is built only in Ohio with 97 percent of its parts American-made. The coupe and the sedan share virtually no exterior parts except their headlights. And the number of components was reduced by 15 percent keeping prices in check.While the ultraconservative lines of the Accord sedan were drawn in Japan the coupe's somewhat more liberal styling sprang from Honda's Ohio development center. The front end is generic Honda (which these days looks a lot like generic Toyota) and a flowing roof line tapers back toward the most daring feature a high back end with a huge bumper and a fender-to-fender reflective panel that evokes the NSX from Acura Honda's luxury division.Engines have long been Honda's forte and the company has outdone itself again. The four-cylinder power plant has been reworked and enlarged from 2.2 to 2.3 liters. Because of its variable valve timing -- a complex bit of magic with which the opening of the intake valves changes based on the engine speed for optimal combustion -- it is peppy superefficient and so clean that the car qualifies as a low-emission vehicle in all 50 states. Indeed the EX model sold in California is the first gas-powered car to meet stricter ultra-low-emission standards.The four-cylinder ought to please most people but the power-hungry have an alternative: a new 3-liter 200-horsepower V6 that also has variable valve timing -- a first for a V6. It idles in silence and accelerates with silky easy athleticism. But put your foot down and it revs freely to 6000 r.p.m. and beyond. Alas the four-speed automatic -- a good smooth one to be sure -- only flirts with the engine's capabilities and a five-speed manual doesn't come with the V6.Of course Honda knows that sporty-car types will look instead to the Prelude and that style mavens will consider the Acura CL -- a car that shares much with the Accord coupe including its engines. If this oh-so-mainstream coupe has a distinct lack of personality it is partly by design.No complaints though about the way it drives or rides. The handling was stable and predictable even in driving rain and severe winds but the suspension would rather comfort your backside than hug the curves. And while the Accord rides rather well there was enough wind hum -- granted during a spell of nasty windy weather -- that it seemed incongruous in the opulent cabin.

 9,In 1971 a group called the Beginning of the End had its only hit with "Funky Nassau" a mixture of funk and Bahamian junkanoo the drum-driven music of street parades. Two decades later the Baha Men Bahamians from Brooklyn have revived both the song and the idea. The album the group plans to release in September is called "Junkanoo" (Atlantic) but the music the Baha Men played on Thursday night at S.O.B.'s might better have been called "funkanoo."On the stage was the Baha Men's funk band half -- guitars keyboard bass drums -- while other band members playing junkanoo drums (with Sterno torches inside) and shaking cowbells strutted on the dance floor; the band members wore bright tropical colors and fancifully decorated straw hats. But while funk and junkanoo share a heavy downbeat the band's hybrid songs leaned toward funk with Nehemiah Hield's lead vocals sliding in Stevie Wonder style and the band switching between major-key junkanoo vamps and modal funk. The Baha Men's lyrics are tourist fare full of beaches and coconut drinks but the words are mostly pretexts for danceable rhythms.The Baha Men are a good funk band looking back to the early-1970's efforts of Mr. Wonder Parliament and others. But the junkanoo rhythm section that could make the music distinctive was largely a visual effect until as a finale the band paraded off stage across the dance floor. Then the bumptious jaunty junkanoo rhythm finally surfaced.The Baha Men are to perform tomorrow at 3 P.M. with the soca singer Superblue at the Central Park Summerstage Rumsey Field mid-park at 72d Street.
 0,Still wherever Lopez goes he is never far from a disquisition on humanity’s merciless ways. Rising from his bed one night in the tropical heat of Isla Santa Cruz in the Galápagos he walks alone (a frequent habit that makes for some of the book’s best bits) to the beach and watches a group of brown pelicans asleep on the bay. The birds’ vulnerability — “oblivious just now to all that is hidden and potentially threatening in the lightless world we share” — leads his train of thought to Spanish conquistadores releasing vicious dogs on Indians and from there to the European bankers who underwrote the slave trade in West Africa and on to the present horrors of Boko Haram. It’s all ultimately in the service of pondering the roots of barbarism and how we ignore the barbarism unfolding in our own society at our peril.Image Clearcutting near Highway 30 in Oregon. Credit... Leah Nash for The New York Times[ Read our round-up of recent books about climate change. ]Strangely though these relentless reminders of egregious acts don’t diminish the appeal of seeing the world through Lopez’s eyes. His reverence for exploring every corner of the world even the sites of its most shameful histories is infectious. Rarely does Lopez decline an offer of adventure no matter how potentially grueling the trip might be. Traveling he writes “turns the mind toward a consideration of context and releases it from the dictatorship of absolute truths about humanity. It helps one understand that all people do not want to be on the same road.”Lopez’s journeys often start in ways that make you shake your head. (More than a few trips begin with a banal sentence like: “In the austral fall of 1987 I was traveling through Namibia with a few people.” You know as one does.) One night he reads a paper in the scientific journal Nature about the discovery of some 4.27-billion-year-old zircon crystals in remote Western Australia. He immediately emails the researchers about visiting the field site — because he just happens to be headed to Perth soon “en route from Zimbabwe to the Northern Territory.”The scientists initially ignore his request. But he persists and several years later he’s finally on his way to the Jack Hills. He flies from the United States to Sydney and then goes by train to Perth persuading the engineers to let him ride in the locomotive. One day crossing the vast Nullarbor Plain “the train suddenly ran into a wall of water” a drenching rainstorm. When the weather clears a double rainbow appears. And then a mob of kangaroos arrives over a hundred of them leaping across the plain. “The sight of it was so exhilarating the three of us in the cab nodded an affirmation to one another. Whatever was wild and lyrical in the timeless world we were in the middle of it now.”Lopez proceeds in a rented four-wheel drive to a sheep-ranching outpost where a geologist has arranged lodging 120 miles from the nearest town “on an unsigned dirt track.” When he arrives the rancher and his daughter have “a meat pie in the oven and he wanted to know whether I took milk with my tea.” One day as Lopez is heading out to the geology site the rancher offers him a rifle and asks if he’d mind shooting any wild goats he encounters. Lopez declines. But through evening chats on the veranda the two men form a bond; the rancher ultimately visits Lopez at home in Oregon. This knack for making friends in the most unlikely places resonates long after you turn the last page. “Are we not bound” he asks “to learn how to speak with each other?”Had we mastered that skill 30-odd years ago would we be where we find ourselves today grappling with violent xenophobia while forests incinerate oceans rise and acidify magnificent organisms everywhere fade away? Where will we be three decades on if we don’t take heed? There is still time though not as much as there once was to shape what’s coming.

 9,She was 11 when the New York City Ballet production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" came to Los Angeles. She was cast as a bug. Standing on stage gazing up at company principals like Edward Villella Arthur Mitchell and Suzanne Farrell she became infatuated with dance. Five years later Ms. Watts came to New York to study at the School of American Ballet. She was nearly expelled for defying every rule -- often missing class cavalierly showing up late -- penchants that might have precluded a dancing career were it not for Balanchine who saw the potential in the skinny rebellious girl with the broad shoulders amazing extensions and powerful jump."Balanchine made me dance" she now says."Don't be reverent about my ballets; just dance" he would tell her.So she danced and sometimes even she was pleased with her performance. "There are nights when you are lucky enough to tap into something about yourself that you are unaware of and can't possibly control" Ms. Watts says "and somehow at that moment other people can view it or sense it or feel it."Yet she never relinquished her defiance. She was outspoken undiplomatic possessed of great intelligence and a greater ability to charm and offend. Capable of warm generosity or a rudeness that could verge on cruelty she was given to extremes of emotion that inspired extremes of approval and disapproval from others. As the years went by she established herself on stage and off as a fiercely commanding presence whose preferred attire was a baseball cap and an oversize T-shirt a controversial figure who was never what ballerinas are supposed to be. "I guess that ballerinas are supposed to be quiet" she says.Nothing made her more controversial than her long relationship with Peter Martins with whom she lived worked and fought bitterly often in public. The union began in 1969 when she was 16 and he was a 23-year-old principal dancer with City Ballet and continued into the 1980's when he became the company's artistic director. "We grew up together" is how they both tended to put it. And they stayed tied in ways that suggest that certain bonds run long and deep and are difficult to sever."As a dancer Heather was wiry and weird and didn't dance in a usual fashion" Mr. Martins recalls. "She could do classical things lyrical things. You couldn't categorize her."
 0,Doug Mills/The New York TimesOMAHA — A man entered the CenturyLink Center on Sunday morning in a T-shirt with “Torres 41” stenciled on the back. Presumably the shirt was 4 years old and referred to the swimmer Dara Torres’s age at the 2008 United States Olympic Trials since the 1 had been crossed out and replaced by a handwritten 2 then subsequently crossed out for a 3 and then a 4 and then a 5.The shirt had room for more numerals but the 45-year-old Torres declared months ago there would be no more comebacks. After surgery on her right shoulder following the 2008 Beijing Games and reconstructive left knee surgery in 2009 Torres will devote herself to other fitness pursuits once she has concluded this bid to make a sixth Olympic swim team which would extend her American record.Torres is swimming only one event here at the Olympic Trials the 50-meter freestyle and cheers greeted her when she strolled onto the pool deck for preliminaries and semifinals on Sunday.In the preliminaries Torres made up ground in the last 20 meters to finish second in the heat and fifth over all in 25.00 seconds. Torres came back to swim 24.80 in the semifinals third fastest behind Jessica Hardy (24.56) and Christine Magnuson (24.72). The final is Monday night and Torres must finish first or second to make the team.“It wasn’t all I’ve got” she said. “I went a little faster than I hoped but going faster is always a good thing. I’m ecstatic.”By the way: Torres is 20 years older than Hardy and 18 years older than Magnuson. And none of the other finalists were alive when Torres swam at her first Olympics in 1984.Four years ago Torres stunned the swimming world by winning the 50 and 100 freestyles at the Trials. Even more remarkably as the oldest swimmer ever to race at the Olympics she overcame a painful shoulder to take silver in the 50 free. She set an American record that still stands 24.07 seconds while finishing just behind Britta Steffen of Germany. Torres added two silvers in relays to give her 12 Olympic medals tying Jenny Thompson for the most by an American woman. Natalie Coughlin has 11.Now the shoulder is better but the knee remains troublesome. It hurts to kick Torres said so she surfaces earlier than other swimmers and relies on her upper-body strength to pull her through. Torres said her coach Bruno Darzi told her to use her legs more in the semifinal to make sure she advanced.“It’s much tougher this time around” Torres said. “People were saying I was middle-aged when I was 41. I’m really middle-aged now.”And because of her age Torres said her body can’t recover from hard swims the way it used to. That’s why she didn’t double up in the 100 free an event with three times the chance of going to London. The top six in the 100 free qualify because it feeds the 4×100 free relay with the fifth- and sixth-place finishers handling preliminaries for the bigger names.Entering the 100 and the 50 would have meant two swims a day for three straight days which Torres considered too demanding.“I know people say there are six places on the team in the 100” Torres said. “But I have a hard time swimming twice in a day let alone three times in two days. It’s much better for me to go for the 50 even though the chances aren’t as great.”Hardy the 100 freestyle champion swam next to Torres in the preliminaries and the semifinals.“It’s really fun racing Dara” Hardy said. “She’s an inspiration for me. Just seeing her in such great shape at that age she’s in better shape than all of us out there.”Torres’s continued defiance of the calendar inspired a reporter to ask 40-year-old Janet Evans who emerged from a 14-year retirement to swim the 400 and 800 here but never advanced out of the preliminaries whether she should have tried shorter races.“I cannot swim a 200 and a 100 and a 50. Are you kidding me?” Evans said sweetly and with a smile. “So I never thought of that. I can’t sprint to save my life. I wish I could but I can’t.”

And representatives of the Orthodox Union the leading organization that certifies kosher products said that while the pictures were not pretty they did not make the case that the slaughterhouse had violated kosher law.The plant is the country's largest producer of meat certified as glatt kosher the highest standard for cleanliness under kosher law. ("Glatt" means smooth or free of the lung blemishes that might indicate disease.) Employing 600 people and selling under the popular Aaron's Best brand it is the only American plant allowed to export to Israel.

 9,The new ''Mikado'' - which will shortly be seen in Los Angeles with Dudley Moore in Mr. Idle's place - startled the British press and public by throwing out the usual Japanese trappings in favor of a British hotel lobby of the late 1920's complete with a monochromaticaly dressed cast straight out of a Marx Brothers film. Mr. Miller's aim was to bring Gilbert's burlesque of English manners closer to our time by changing the setting to something more recognizable to modern audiences. Detractors thought the change just as arbitrary and gimmicky as Mr. Miller's ''Rigoletto'' resetting in New York's Little Italy another production done for the E.N.O. and others pointed out that the spectacle of japonaiserie was part of the thrill of ''The Mikado'' whether in 1885 or a century later.On the recording the sets and costumes are immaterial and those seeking any revisionist reading of Gilbert's lyrics or Sullivan's score will find very few changes. They will find just over an hour of music left untouched and sung nicely and a new set of lyrics for Ko-Ko's ''little list'' song. These written by Mr. Idle and Mr. Miller (and published by Kay-Gee-Bee Music) attempt a mild offensiveness in the Monty Python mode. During his lifetime Gilbert sanctioned encore verses - written by himself - and it might have been a good idea to have let Mr. Idle do the originals first. (In performance there is a new overture of no great interest which has not been included here.) Of the singers I enjoyed Felicity Palmer as Katisha; some may find Bonaventura Bottone's Nanki-Poo just too-too in its exaggerated 1920's musical-comedy tone. By releasing only highlights the original British record company seems to have judged that the public would want just a souvenir of this picturesque production rather than a musically complete version.The new ''Ruddigore'' is a different matter being more complete than any previous version of the operetta. In the days that followed the badly received premiere of that operetta Gilbert and Sullivan made quite a few cuts and changes mostly in the problematic second act in which a chorus of ghosts not only step out of their picture frames but marry the female chorus at the work's conclusion. This distasteful finale was replaced (although one of the dead baronets still teams up with his former sweetheart) and the offending ''y'' in ''Ruddygore'' was changed to an ''i'' at a time when ''ruddy'' or ''bloody'' were too much for family audiences.In spite of these alterations a respectable eight-month London run and various tours the operetta sank into a ghostly oblivion. When it finally was revived in London in 1921 two D'Oyly Carte musical directors had made numerous ''improvements'' on Sullivan's original manuscript and another Malcolm Sargent added his own thoughts a few seasons later.Surprisingly many of these emendations improved ''Ruddigore'' - the 1920's overture (like the original not arranged by Sullivan) is more exciting the ghost scene is thrillingly condensed discarding a dull dead march and some weary choral responses as well as two attempts at a patter song right after the ghost scene that were simply ineffective. On the other hand certain cuts restored in this recording are delightful particularly the original finale (''When a Man Has Been a Naughty Baronet'') missing second verses and the charming love duet in Act I (''The Battle's Roar Is Over''). One also gets to hear the melodrame in Act II involving a dagger but this would have been more effective with the dialogue it is supposed to accompany.

 0,IN the first five months of this year companies with speculative credit ratings issued a huge amount of debt. But lately it has become harder to find enthusiastic buyers of their junk bonds.Through May the volume of new high-yield or junk bonds was up 53 percent compared with the corresponding period of 2002 according to Thomson Financial. And May has been one of the busiest months ever with $17.8 billion of such bonds sold.Seeking yields higher than the meager rates offered on safer bonds investors piled into junk-bond mutual funds. But recent data suggests that redemptions from such funds are rising.Bruce H. Monrad the chairman of Northeast Investors Trust in Boston with $1.8 billion under management most of it in high-yield bonds talked last week about the junk-bond market. Following are excerpts from the conversation:Q. According to Moody's Investors Service the default rate on corporate bonds stood at 5.8 percent for the 12 months ended April 30. That's down from 11.5 percent for the year ended Jan. 1 2002. Are fundamental conditions positive for high-yield bonds?

 9,Reversing years of declining support United Way of Tri-State will report today that it raised $103 million in the last year up 4.5 percent over the previous year after adjusting for inflation the first real increase in this decade.The growth is the first since United Way of America was rocked by a scandal six years ago that sent its president to prison for stealing charity funds and the local United Ways saw their support drop. Donations have also suffered from downsizing at major corporations slow wage growth and less interest in giving to health and human services agencies.Even with the increase contributions by the 137 large companies and their workers in the New York metropolitan region that give through Tri-State is still 15 percent below the 1991-92 figure when pledges totaled $121.4 million adjusted for inflation as are all figures reported here.The increase in pledges should translate into small increases in allocations in the next 12 months to many of the health and human services agencies that depend on United Way for support. Typically about 6 percent of pledges are not fulfilled often because people switch jobs.
 9,Hugh Rodham's supporters in Miami had been promising that he would be a fresh face in Florida politics. But even they might not have realized just how fresh.The voting records of the Dade County Supervisor of Elections Office show that Mr. Rodham Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother who began his bid this week for the Democratic nomination to the United States Senate registered to vote in the state only in December 1991 -- in time to cast a ballot for his brother-in-law Bill Clinton in the 1992 Presidential race.Even though Mr. Rodham had been a Dade County resident and government employee for 13 years he had not registered before that according to records examined in Miami today by the New York Times Regional Newspapers. He said he did not remember ever voting for President or state offices before 1992 because he was part of the "lethargy and apathy that presented itself in the 60's and 70's" and that he has now awakened to "the chance to change in the 90's." 'Didn't See the Need for It'That would mean that Mr. Rodham the assistant public defender in Dade County who has said of his potential Republican opponent Senator Connie Mack that "there should be a hue and cry throughout the land for his scalp" did not vote against Mr. Mack when the conservative Republican ran for Senate in 1988.

 0,''The tickets are worth what they're worth'' said John Pleasants Ticketmaster's president and chief executive. ''If somebody wants to charge $50 for a ticket but it's actually worth $1000 on eBay the ticket's worth $1000. I think more and more our clients -- the promoters the clients in the buildings and the bands themselves -- are saying to themselves 'Maybe that money should be coming to me instead of Bob the Broker.' ''EBay has long been a busy marketplace for tickets auctioned by brokers and others. Late last week for example it had more than 22000 listings for ticket sales.Venue operators promoters and performers will decide whether to participate in the Ticketmaster auctions Mr. Pleasants said. In June the company tested the system for the Lennox Lewis-Vitali Klitschko boxing match at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The minimum bid for the package -- two ringside seats a boxing glove autographed by Mr. Lewis and access to workouts among other features -- was $3000 and the top payer spent about $7000 a Staples Center spokesman Michael Roth said.Once the auction service goes live Ticketmaster will receive flat fees or a percentage of the winning bids to be decided with the operators of each event said Sean Moriarty Ticketmaster's executive vice president for products technology and operations.Along with home printing auctions are central to ''a new age of the ticket'' Mr. Pleasants said. In the second quarter of this year tickets sold online with or without home printing represented 51 percent of Ticketmaster's ticket sales. The rest were sold by phone or at walk-up locations.

 9,To the Editor:In his generous review of my book ''Painting by Numbers: Komar and Melamid's Scientific Guide to Art'' (Jan. 4) Luc Sante suggests that the poll of American tastes in painting which forms the basis of the whole project that the book engages was a simple matter of artists' hiring telephone researchers to ring up some people with a few questions. This doesn't do justice to what was a formidable collaborative effort.Chief among the collaborators was the Nation Institute a nonprofit organization that raised all of the money for the American poll and contracted an established Boston firm Marttila & Kiley to conduct it. The pollsters then drafted the questionnaire in concert with the artists and some of us from the Nation Institute/Nation magazine offices; tested it in focus groups at the Manhattan Opinion Center; and hired the trained professionals who finally telephoned a representative sample of American households. A similar approach was taken by other firms in countries subsequently surveyed.In other words this poll -- statistically accurate within a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percent at a 95 percent confidence level -- was no different in execution from any of the polls regularly used to determine the names of laundry detergent or indeed the direction of American foreign policy. As Alexander Melamid says in an interview in the book: ''We just were thinking about how this society works and how the rulers in this society get in touch with the people with real American people. How producers get in touch with consumers. In real life they take polls. . . . And this is a scientifically accurate poll so if this poll is wrong then all polls are wrong.''One other small correction: the discussion of the project in which Dore Ashton and others from the art world participated and which Sante cites took place not at the Whitney Museum but at the School of Visual Arts.

 0,ZIMMERMAN--Kenneth.Kenneth "Kenny" Zimmerman son of Jerome and Renee Zimmerman beloved Husband Father and Grandfather passed away June 25 2014 at his home in Edgewater New Jersey. Born in Brooklyn New York Zimmerman attended Poly Prep High School and then graduated from The University of Miami in 1972. Shortly thereafter he started Kenar Enterprises with Murray Levy. In the early 90's Zimmerman was one of the first and one of the strongest leaders in philanthropic efforts in the Fashion Industry. He used his company's largest advertising vehicle the billboard at One Times Square under the Sony TV screen for 10 years. It was there that the world could see his provocative advertisements of global social issues such as AIDS Elisabeth Glaser's Pediatric AIDS Foundation and Evelyn Lauder's Breast Cancer Research Foundation. His well-known supermodels Linda Evangelista Helena Christensen Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer were the cause of many traffic jams in Times Square. One of his most celebrated campaigns featured an advertisement shot in Sicily with Linda Evangelista and seven Sicilian women dressed in black; limited editions of the photograph were sold with proceeds going to an AIDS education group. The International Center for Photography included it as one of the '20 most important fashion photographs" ever. Kenar opened stores world-wide but in 1994 the New York flagship on Madison Avenue opened to much fan-fare as Mrs. Evelyn Lauder Mayor Giuliani Elizabeth Hurley Linda Evangelista and Mr. Zimmerman cut the huge Pink Ribbon dedicating a portion of Kenar's sales that October for Breast Cancer Awareness month to BCRF. After selling the brand Kenar to the Pegasus Fund Kenny purchased other brands that were in bankruptcy and rebuilt them. Some of these brands were Schrader St. Gillian A.J. Bari Freeway In Transit and Hero Group (Black Tie by Oleg Cassini). In 1999 Kenny formed a new venture Emma Black and Zola Evening producing sportswear and evening wear for major department stores around the world. Never satisfied with all of his accomplishments in 2003 Kenny developed Calvin Klein Outerwear a newly acquired license by Calvin Klein Corporation. He was proud to be able to support many charities and causes. Another project dear to his heart was working with The Partnership for the Homeless along with restaurants across the city helping to feed those less fortunate. He was on the Board of The Jack Martin Fund at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Board of Directors at the JCC on the Palisades. He was also on the Advisory Board of Babies Hospital at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Kenny's family was more important than any of his companies or positions. Arlene Zimmerman his beloved wife of 42 years; his proud loving children Nicole Zachary and Ryan Zimmerman; his grandchildren Ethan and Jordan Zimmerman; and his sister Leslie Daspin survive him. His eldest son Matthew predeceased him in 2012.

 9,CHICAGO June 30 — Gov‐ ernor William W. Scranton said today that the Republican voters of Illinois supported his candidacy for the Presidential nomination even if their convention delegates did not. He expected he said that some of the delegates would recog‐nize that fact by convention time. July 13.The Pennsylvania Governor at a news conference said that the Nielson Poll an established organization had found that 65 per cent of the Illinois Republicans favored him and that 35 per cent supported Sentor Barry Goldwater.Mr. Scranton's news conference took place before the Illinois delegation announced that 48 of its 58 members had committed themselves to Mr. Goldwater with none for Mr. Scranton.The Governor however had been prepared for the blow. He was asked whether he would be surprised or shocked if the delegation indicated 48 or more for his rival.

 0,Polls are the best way to find out who plans to vote and for whom they plan to vote. But polls are imperfect. They ask questions of a sampling of people — often about a thousand — and use those answers to draw conclusions about the public at large.This year there is a new wrinkle one that complicates the picture and could throw some of the polling off: the effects of newly enacted restrictive voting laws.Take for instance the results of a New York Times/CBS News/Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday. “Likely voters” were polled in the swing states of Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania and President Obama led Mitt Romney in each state — by 6 points in Ohio and Florida and by 11 points in Pennsylvania. President Obama carried all three states in the last election and needs them in this one. Encouraging for him right?But let’s dig in a bit and look at some of the variables that could weigh on those results.First there are the quirks that always exist. It’s August and many voters aren’t intensely focused on the election yet. Sixty percent or less in each state say that they are paying a lot of attention to the presidential campaign at this point and these are states that have been soaked in ads and visited often by the candidates. (On Wednesday Obama made his 25th trip to Ohio since becoming president.)People also tend to overstate their intention to vote. Many national and state polls show that more than three quarters of respondents say they will definitely vote in upcoming presidential elections. This is a major component of the way pollsters determine “likely voters.” But that level of voting is not supported by historical patterns. According to the United States Elections Project the turnout rate for the voting-eligible population in Florida in 2008 was just 67 percent in Ohio it was 68 percent and in Pennsylvania it was 64 percent. So many of those who say that they are definitely going to vote actually won’t.Then there are the new voter restrictions that are likely to trim the voter rolls and add tremendous voter confusion.Pennsylvania has passed a highly restrictive photo ID requirement for its voters. A study conducted by professors from the University of Washington and the University of New Mexico found that more than a million registered voters in Pennsylvania and 757325 people who voted in 2008 lack a valid ID under this scheme. More than a third of registered voters are unaware that a photo ID law even exists.This means that a lot of people who say that they are likely to vote may not actually be eligible to vote. (Arguments in a suit contesting the Pennsylvania law are being heard this week .)Now to Florida and Ohio: both states have cut their early voting periods. According to the Brennan Center for Justice more than a million people who voted in Florida and Ohio in 2008 did so on days that have been eliminated.As the Associated Press reported about the Ohio restriction in July:The state doesn’t track its early voters by party so the stats don’t show exactly how much Obama might have benefited from early voting in Ohio. But both parties are sure he did. An extended voting period is perceived as benefiting Democrats because it increases voting opportunities for those harder to reach for an Election Day turnout — Hispanics blacks new citizens and poor people.Florida has already moved to potentially purge thousands of voters from its registration rolls. In May The Miami Herald said of the purge:Hispanic Democratic and independent-minded voters are the most likely to be targeted in a state hunt to remove thousands of noncitizens from Florida’s voting rolls a Miami Herald computer analysis of elections records has found. Whites and Republicans are disproportionately the least-likely to face the threat of removal the analysis of a list of more than 2600 potential noncitizens shows.The Republican governor of Florida has also made it harder for ex-felons to vote. According to a report last month in USA Today:The Florida Board of Executive Clemency headed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott reversed predecessor Republican Gov. Charlie Crist‘s policy that automatically restored voting rights to non-violent offenders upon the completion of their sentences. Ex-felons must now wait five years before applying to regain rights.The newspaper pointed out that “the Sentencing Project a group advocating reforms in prison and sentencing policy says 60% of the prison system population is made up of African Americans and Latinos.” It almost goes without saying that these groups traditionally vote more Democratic.Rolling Stone reported in May that this could disenfranchise “100000 previously eligible ex-felons” in Florida.It’s unclear how many voters are aware of the new rules and whether they’d be able to vote even if they were. What is clear is that fewer Democrats say that they are paying a lot of attention to the election in these three states than Republicans by a margin of 8 to 14 percentage points. It would stand to reason that they might also be less aware of the new laws.This year we may have to take the polls with an even larger grain of salt than usual. The greatest margin of uncertainty may well be caused by poll respondents who think that they will able to vote for President Obama in November but may not be allowed to do so.And it’s all thanks to the Great Suppression of 2012.

 0,WHEN Stephen Sondheim extolled the virtues of ''the little things you do together'' in the musical ''Company'' eating candy was nowhere on the list. Now Mars the confectionery giant that makes Milky Way is revamping the brand's advertising in most markets around the world to promote the candy bar as one of life's small delights.In a campaign that begins today in the United States and in May in Britain and Europe offices of Grey Worldwide the brand's new agency are asserting that it provides ''Pleasure you can't measure.''The American part of the campaign features television commercials comparing Milky Way to momentary thrills that deliver frissons of good feelings. Among them: reaching that itchy spot with a back scratcher breaking the bubbles in shrink wrap with a satisfying popping sound making a friend's hair stand on end with a balloon and watching a car odometer turn over from 99999 miles.Those pleasures are perhaps minuscule to the point of invisibility. But when consumers have long since learned to ignore or even mock the hyperbole of advertising offering a scaled-down easily delivered benefit may be no small feat. That is particularly true when seeking to stimulate sales for venerable brands like Milky Way because breathlessly Bunyanesque claims are less likely to be believable with familiar products.

Maritime observers said yesterday that the current offer probably constituted a juggling of the old package with more money going to wages.It has been management's contention in recent weeks that the 43 per cent increase includ ing 32 per cent in wages was the limit especially in view of widespread opposition to such a large offer in employer ranks.Management sources and others close to the dispute con tinued to express amazement yesterday as to why the union's leadership was unable to “sell” the 43‐per‐cent package.There is general agreement on both sides that the package was a good one—by itself and in relation to recent labor set tlements in the maritime in dustry.

 0,Last Updated | Tuesday 7:12 a.m. As my colleague David Kirkpatrick reports video posted on YouTube five days ago apparently showing a missing American journalist in the hands of jihadist captors in Syria may have been staged to discredit the armed opposition to the Syrian government according to several analysts who viewed the clip on Monday.The reporter Austin Tice left the United States Marine Corps last year and has been contributing freelance articles to two American newspaper companies McClatchy and The Washington Post and other outlets since he smuggled himself into Syria from Turkey in May. He last communicated with colleagues by e-mail on Aug. 13. An update he posted on Twitter two days earlier about enjoying an alcohol-fueled birthday party with members of the Free Syrian Army underscored that he was on good terms with the rebels he was reporting on at the time.Spent the day at an FSA pool party with music by @taylorswift13. They even brought me whiskey. Hands down best birthday ever. — Austin Tice (@Austin_Tice) 11 Aug 12A State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at a briefing on Monday: “We’ve seen the video. We are not in a position to verify (a) whether it’s him (b) whether it represents an actual scene that happened or something that may have been staged.” She added: ” There’s a lot of reason for the Syrian Government to duck responsibility but we continue to believe that to the best of our knowledge we think he is in Syrian Government custody.”Mr Tice’s parents Marc and Debra Tice confirmed that the man in the video was their son in a statement that began: “Knowing Austin is alive and well is comforting to our family. Though it is difficult to see our eldest son in such a setting and situation as that depicted in the video it is reassuring that he appears to be unharmed.”As the McClatchy correspondent Hannah Allam explains the brief video clip showing the reporter alive was uploaded to a new YouTube account last Wednesday but seen much more widely on Monday after it was posted on Facebook by supporters of President Bashar al-Assad. James Ball of The Washington Post reports that the pro-Assad blogger who drew attention to the video on Facebook wrote that the images of the reporter being held by Islamists rather than government forces proved that “Western media is working against Syria.”Analysts contacted by both McClatchy and The Post and bloggers who have worked to authenticate video from Syria for the past 18 months agreed that some details of the video did not ring true.The clip shows the American captive wearing a blindfold clearly distressed as he tries to recite an Islamic prayer in Arabic to armed captors before breaking off and exclaiming in English: “Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.” Close observers of video from Syria and of jihadist clips drew attention to the unusual clothes worn by Mr. Tice’s captors and the halting way they shouted expressions of praise for Allah as if they needed to be prompted.Joseph Holliday a former United States Army intelligence officer who tracks Syrian rebel groups for the Institute for the Study of War in Washington told The Post that it seemed strange that the armed men around Mr. Tice were wearing what appear to be salwar kameez traditional clothing worn in Afghanistan which looked very clean. “It’s like a caricature of a jihadi group” he said. “My gut instinct is that regime security guys dressed up like a bunch of wahoos and dragged him around and released the video to scare the U.S. and others about the danger of Al Qaeda extremists in Syria. It would fit their narrative perfectly.”The video came to light the same day that Syria’s foreign minister Walid al-Moallem scolded other countries who “clearly induce and support terrorism in Syria with money weapons and foreign fighters” in an address to the United Nations General Assembly.In an interview with McClatchy Murad Batal al Shishani an analyst in London who monitors extremist groups cast doubt on a comment on the pro-Assad Facebook page which said that “the American journalist Austin Tice is with the Nusra Front gangs and Al Qaeda in Syria” an apparent reference to Jabhat al-Nusra a jihadist group. But as Ms. Allam writes that organization has “a sophisticated media wing that produces a Twitter feed and videos that are clearly labeled and edited.” It would be unusual for the group to have simply uploaded the clip to YouTube and waited for pro-Assad bloggers to draw attention to it rather than using well-known jihadist Internet forums.Jenan Moussa a reporter for Al Aan TV in Dubai who has worked in Syria recently wrote on Twitter that none of the fighters from that group she saw there wore Afghan-style clothing.Jabhat AlNusra fighters I saw w/ @HaraldDoornbos in #Syria had military fatigue. Few fighters had long Dashdasha not afghan Shalwar Kameez. — Jenan Moussa (@jenanmoussa) 1 Oct 12A Syrian activist who writes on Twitter as @THE_47th posted a link to another Web video with a logo titles music and flashy editing noting “This is what a Jabhat Al Nusra capture video looks like it is of 5 Yemeni Officers captured in Syria thought to be helping the regime.”In an interview with Matt Weaver the Guardian’s Middle East live-blogger on Tuesday a friend who helped Mr. Tice enter Syria said the journalist had tried to interview a Jabhat Al Nusra commander but the group then cancelled a scheduled meeting.Mr. Tice’s friend Michael Weiss is the research director of the conservative Henry Jackson Society a foreign policy institute in London. He also told The Guardian: “The last time I spoke to Austin was on G-chat August 8th and he was in an area of Damascus that was subsequently pummeled by the regime and then raided.”After viewing the video Mr. Tice’s family in Texas and senior editors at McClatchy and The Post called for his immediate release.As he reported from Syria this year Mr. Tice used social networks to stay in touch with his family to publish his work and even to argue about coverage of the conflict with colleagues.Darraya residents clean a town street. Most gov services have been cut to this suburb on the west side of Damascus. //t.co/k5SVamaF — Austin Tice (@Austin_Tice) 7 Aug 12In a series of Twitter updates the week before he disappeared Mr. Tice criticized a post on The Lede drawing attention to a spate of new reports from Western journalists who made it into rebel-held territory in August. “The way has always been open. This whole spin is an excuse for laziness” he wrote. “Clearly the risk is real” he added: “But idea that it’s prohibitive of more/better coverage is a red herring. I see it as corporate overlawyering.”.@RobertMackey @thelede @hadeelalsh @javierespinosa2 @martinchulov The way has always been open. This whole spin is an excuse for laziness. — Austin Tice (@Austin_Tice) 7 Aug 12Just weeks before he went missing the former soldier wrote a manifesto of sorts on Facebook explaining his decision to work in such a risky environment to family and friends which was reproduced in its entirety by The Post in August. The message began:It’s nice and all but please quit telling me to be safe. Against my better judgment I’m posting this on Facebook. Flame away. People keep telling me to be safe (as if that’s an option) keep asking me why I’m doing this crazy thing keep asking what’s wrong with me for coming here. So listen. Our granddads stormed Normandy and Iwo Jima and defeated global fascism. Neil Armstrong flew to the Moon in a glorified trashcan doing math on a clipboard as he went. Before there were roads the Pioneers put one foot in front of the other until they walked across the entire continent. Then a bunch of them went down to fight and die in Texas ‘cause they thought it was the right thing to do. Sometime between when our granddads licked the Nazis and when we started putting warnings on our coffee cups about the temperature of our beverage America lost that pioneering spirit. We became a fat weak complacent coddled unambitious and cowardly nation. I went off to two wars with misguided notions of patriotism and found in both that the first priority was to never get killed something we could have achieved from our living rooms in America with a lot less hassle. To protect careers and please the politicians we weighed ourselves down with enough armor to break a man’s back gorged on RipIts and ice cream and believed our own press that we were doing something noble.He contrasted American life to the current struggle in Syria where “every person in this country fighting for their freedom wakes up every day and goes to sleep every night with the knowledge that death could visit them at any moment.”He concluded:

 9,The New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association is expected to name a new head coach within the next few weeks according to Maureen Coyle the team's director of public relations.But there was considerable speculation yesterday that the team had already found its man.Richie Adubato a former head coach with the Dallas Mavericks Orlando Magic and Detroit Pistons and a former assistant with the Knicks Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers was the name being mentioned as highest on a very short list of candidates.The Liberty fired Nancy Darsch as coach in September after the team lost its last regular-season game missing a shot at the playoffs. In 1997 the W.N.B.A.'s first year the Liberty made it to the championship round before losing to Houston. LENA WILLIAMS

Two measures of that progress will be evident here Monday night at the third Women's Sports Foundation annual awards dinner.First 77 world-class female athletes will be guests and second many male sports celebrities will be there to honor them.Herb Brooks the Rangers' coach is one of the men who will present awards. ''I'm going to be there because I think women in athletics is a very healthy thing for our society'' said Brooks whose hockey season opens two days later. ''The spinoff is that our whole society will become more conscious of physical fitness and go from a society of spectators to a society of participants.''Rafer Johnson the 1960 Olympic decathalon champion will present the Professional Sportswoman of the Year award. Steve Scott the American mile record-holder will present the award for the Amateur Sportswoman of the Year.

 0,SCHECTMAN--Oscar (Ossie). The National Basketball Association mourns the loss and celebrates the life of Oscar "Ossie" Schectman the player credited with scoring the first basket in NBA history an original New York Knickerbocker and the team's first captain. Schectman passed away Tuesday July 30. He was 94. On November 1 1946 the 6-0 guard who had signed with his hometown team in the fledgling Basketball Association of America (BAA) the predecessor to the NBA was on the court in Toronto for the tip off of the league's inaugural game between the Knickerbockers and Toronto Huskies. Moments after the tip Schectman entered the history books scoring the league's first basket on an underhand layup. He finished the game with 11 points in a 68-66 New York victory. Schectman appeared in 54 games for the Knicks in 1946-47 his lone season in the league. He averaged 8.1 points and ranked third overall with 2.0 assists per game. He began his professional basketball career in the American Basketball League (ABL) playing five seasons for the Philadelphia Sphas from 1941-46. Following his one-year stint in the BAA Schectman returned to the ABL as a member of the Paterson Crescents. Born on May 30 1919 in New Brunswick NJ Schectman starred at Brooklyn's Samuel J. Tilden High School and at Long Island University. At LIU he was a member of the 1939 NIT championship team and earned Converse First Team All-America honors in 1941 leading LIU to another NIT title. Schectman was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Long Island University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001. The NBA family has lost a true pioneer and we send our condolences to the entire Schectman family. He is survived by his sister Sunny sons Peter and Stu sister-in-law Dorothy daughters-in-law Rotha and Lauren and grandchildren Imani and Alex as well as several nieces and nephews. His wife Evelyn with whom he was married 70 years preceded him in death. Services will be held Friday at Schwartz Brothers Jeffer Memorial Chapel on 114-03 Queens Blvd. Forest Hills N.Y. 11375.
 0,Video“See it looks like the safest street in the city but it’s actually the most dangerous if you happen to be smoking a joint.”This is how Randy Credico sums up Gay Street a quiet one-block lane in Greenwich Village connecting Waverly Place and Christopher Street. People out for an evening in the Village often use the darkened block as a spot to surreptitiously smoke marijuana he says but the illusion of privacy is shattered by sirens and the swooping down of police officers.Mr. Credico 53 a stand-up comic and drug-law reform advocate says he has been warning people constantly and that the police in the area have in turn warned him that he is interfering in their arrests.“The cops are always making arrests here and so I tell people not to light up that they’re going to get busted” he said. “Since when is it a crime to tell people ‘Listen don’t break the law.’”On June 12 Mr. Credico had his own run-in with law enforcement after berating police officers making a pot arrest on Gay Street. According to the police Mr. Credico used obscenities and yelled that that they should be “solving murders” not making marijuana arrests. He was handcuffed and charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct and spent a night in the Manhattan Detention Complex known as the Tombs. Mr. Credico called the arrest retaliation for his practice of warning pot smokers. (The arrest was widely reported online and in New York newspapers.)Paul J. Browne the New York Police Department’s deputy commissioner for public information said in an e-mail message that Mr. Credico is “free to lobby for the legalization if he’s so inclined but he may not interfere with police.”At any rate the arrest seems like the perfect culmination of Mr. Credico’s long crusade against Rockefeller drug laws in New York State which are among the harshest in the nation and he has been a longtime advocate for inmates serving sentences under them. He lives at 13 Gay Street which was once the home of the late radical lawyer William Kunstler and is now the headquarters for the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice a legal aid service which Mr. Credico helps run along with Mr. Kunstler’s widow Margaret.Mr. Credico said he generally supports the police but he sees arrests for small amounts of marijuana as a waste of their resources. He said he has begun documenting what he sees as a misguided policy of drug enforcement by taking photographs of plainclothes detectives arresting people for smoking or possessing marijuana. And he lurks outside city courthouses at lunchtime to try to take pictures of judges prosecutors and detectives bringing in marijuana arrests. He plans to use the pictures to illustrate a comprehensive study to be posted online to prove his claim that the justice system is unfair especially to people of color.Much of Mr. Credico’s stand-up routine consists of his drug-law gripes. He says Mr. Kunstler taught him that publicity is perhaps his strongest weapon. Mr. Credico made headlines in October when he offered $25000 of his own money to bail out Shawn Kovell who was arrested on cocaine charges along with her boyfriend Robert Chambers “the preppy killer” who pleaded guilty to strangling Jennifer Levin during rough sex in Central Park two decades ago.On Monday Mr. Credico stood outside the courthouse at 100 Centre Street dressed in jeans and a blazer and tie he smoked a cigar and wielded a point-and-shoot camera. He paced in front of the courthouse scouring the people walking out. The judges he could recognize from sitting in their courtrooms while they heard cases he said. The prosecutors he could recognize because of their suits (and other attributes which he considers less unflattering). He also looked for detectives walking in people in handcuffs.“Pretty easy to spot” he said. “The cops are usually white and the perps are almost always people of color. They get them on measly harmless marijuana arrests which is the fuel they use to keep this factory of a criminal justice system going.”He had an acquaintance nearby with a video camera to document things in case he got arrested again he said.Mr. Credico’s father served time in jail for safe-cracking and later owned nightclubs in California where Mr. Credico grew up and began doing comedy and cocaine in back rooms with other entertainers. His played the circuit in Las Vegas and performed on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” at age 27. He was the subject of a documentary called “60 Spins Around the Sun” financed by Jack Black and was featured alongside Russell Simmons in “Lockdown USA” a documentary about the Rockefeller drug laws. He is the house comedian on the Albany radio show of Fred Dicker a veteran New York Post reporter.He jokes onstage that “Bloomberg” is Yiddish for “Giuliani” and that narcotics agents in the city are truly undercover because “they leave their white sheets and hoods back on Long Island.”Mr. Credico said his viewpoints were fostered by being around Mr. Kunstler who remains his hero and is memorialized inside 13 Gay Street by photographs on the wall along with images of other counterculture icons like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.Mr. Credico met Mr. Kunstler when an old sweetheart the entertainer Joey Heatherton faced criminal charges and needed a lawyer. Mr. Credico looked up Mr. Kunstler who took the case pro bono and took on Mr. Credico as a friend.As Mr. Credico sat in the Kunstler house explaining all this last Monday the phone rang. He answered. It was an inmate with a drug case.“Kunstler Fund.”“Wait where are you? Rikers?”“So it wasn’t yours? Why did you plead out? Oh so you took the rap for your father then – I see. Yeah I agree: A year and a half seems like a long sentence for a dime bag.”“Listen write your whole story up for me in a letter and send it to me and I’ll see what I can do.”Mr. Credico said that while spending his night in jail recently most of the other detainees he spoke to said they had been arrested on marijuana charges. He said he turned down a settlement offer in his case — one day of community service — because he wants to bring the case to trial for the publicity – representing himself of course.In the meantime he said he would continue to take pictures of undercover police arresting pot smokers and warning people about smoking pot on Gay Street.“Listen I don’t want people committing crimes on my street and I tell them not to” Mr. Credico explained.
 0,Hillary Rodham Clinton has hired the Manhattan advertising firm whose ads for New York magazine in 1997 enraged Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to produce the media campaign in her bid for the United States Senate officials said yesterday.The firm DeVito/Verdi has a reputation for edgy streetwise advertising but has no previous experience working for political candidates. The firm will work with two veteran Democratic operatives: Mandy Grunwald a media consultant and Mark Penn a pollster.DeVito/Verdi based in SoHo developed an ad campaign that ran on the sides of public buses featuring pictures of Mr. Giuliani and proclaiming New York magazine as ''possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit for.''The ads appeared in November 1997 shortly after Mr. Giuliani was overwhelmingly re-elected for a second term. But the mayor infuriated at being portrayed as self-aggrandizing complained to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which removed the ads until a federal appeals court ordered them restored.

 9,The quarterback squeaks when he speaks. That may be one of the few remaining items on Charlie Ward's rapidly shrinking list of weaknesses as he approaches his fifth game as a starter at Florida State.When the Seminoles take an undefeated record into the Orange Bowl this Saturday before a sellout crowd cheering for Miami to extend its 47-game home-field winning streak the X-factor may well prove to be a quiet gifted quarterback."I speak pretty loud" Ward said. "My voice kind of squeaks but it's kind of loud. You have different voices. You have deep voices. You have soft voices and you have squeaky voices. I happen to be soft and squeaky." High-Pressure GameNow well into his junior season the son of a longtime Georgia high school coach will continue his rapid development in one of college football's most high-pressure games. The matchup has had an impact on the top of the rankings since the mid-1980's.

''Awesome isn't it?''He was dwarfed by 9000 cement blocks reinforced by three tons of steel and a quarter mile's worth of pilings sunk into the sandy Florida soil.The wall is painted a color that might be described as Fenway green.This structure is neither a wind screen nor a training center for itinerant jai-alai players. It is a replica of the most famous wall in North America.Soon it will be painted - a string of six zeroes for the team from New York punctuated by a glaring ''3'' in the seventh inning.This cement-block wall will look almost exactly like the wall in Boston on the afternoon of Oct. 2 1978.

 0,PhotoTequila is growing up and expanding its boundaries — no longer a mere cheap foundation for obliterating sugary-sweet cocktails. Darker premium golden-amber-hued añejos hailing from the rainy highlands and arid valleys outside of Guadalajara Mexico and aged in wooden barrels for at least 12 months garner attention all on their own for their sophisticated flavor. This spring gives rise to a new wave of pricier ultra-aged extra añejos (casked in wood from three to seven years) like Patrón’s rare and limited Extra Añejo 7 Años which are best enjoyed sipped (pass on the snifter and opt for Riedel’s Vinum Tequila glass — a Champagne-style flute) not mixed into a margarita.But this season añejo offerings from smaller-batch indie labels like Suerte Tequila Partida and Tequila Tapatio — in addition to the larger labels like Patrón Don Julio Chinaco and Espolòn — are both high-quality and reasonably priced with a smart accessible balance of agave expression and wood. The aging process endows añejo tequila with smoky peppery notes much like those of whiskey or scotch — and attendant aromas of sweet vanilla caramel and intense wood plus that refreshing flash of citrus. They make for a fresh logical ingredient in classic cocktails like old-fashioneds and manhattans. Below a trio of handcrafted añejo cocktail recipes from bartenders practicing their craft in a variety of locations from New York City’s mod well-received Mexican restaurant Cosme (in Chelsea) to the handsome dimly-lit subterranean West Village spot the Up & Up to the hip-casual Brooklyn mainstay Extra Fancy across the Williamsburg Bridge. “Añejo tequilas bridge the gap between the purity and liveliness of a blanco tequila and the round and sophisticated character of oak-aged spirits such as cognac bourbon or aged rum” Extra Fancy’s Rob Krueger explains.

 0,Dr. Baselga did not respond to phone calls or an email message requesting comment.Monday’s meeting between hospital executives and employees was the latest in a series held by the cancer center as it conducts a broad review of policies regarding the nonprofit institution’s ties to outside industries. Memorial Sloan Kettering has been forced to re-examine its rules governing board memberships and compensation in the wake of articles by The Times and ProPublica that revealed insider deals with start-ups that were poised to reap millions of dollars for breakthroughs in cancer treatments and biotechnology advances.The hospital’s senior executives have come under scrutiny in recent weeks leading Mr. Warner to question on Monday whether Dr. Thompson would be permitted to continue sitting on the board of Merck which makes the blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda. In addition to his position with Merck Dr. Thompson is also a director of Charles River Laboratories a publicly traded company that assists research in early drug development.Dr. Thompson received $300000 in compensation from Merck in 2017 according to company financial filings. He was paid $70000 in cash from Charles River in 2017 plus $215050 in stock. The compensation for the two corporate boards was in addition to what he was paid as chief executive at Memorial Sloan Kettering. In 2016 he earned $6.7 million in total compensation from the cancer center and related organizations according to the most recent Internal Revenue Service filings.“Should Craig continue to sit on the Merck board? We have no policy on that” Mr. Warner said during the meeting explaining that he had discussed the board membership with Dr. Thompson when he joined the hospital in 2010. And while it was viewed as a “good thing” Mr. Warner added that “we need to step back from that now and ask ourselves whether that continues to be appropriate whether it’s appropriate in the future.”In a memo late last week and again at Monday’s meeting the New York-based cancer center emphasized the need to overhaul its policies which had failed to address some of the potential conflicts made public recently at a time when investors are tossing vast amounts of money at start-ups developing promising treatments.

 0,Paula CourtAudiences on the West Coast will soon be able to have their senses overstimulated by the Wooster Group’s trippy production of “La Didone.” The New York-based theater troupe will begin a partnership with REDCAT the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater in Los Angeles the Wooster Group said on Friday. Cynthia Hedstrom the troupe’s producer said in an interview that the collaboration would bring several Wooster Group productions to REDCAT for residencies of one to two weeks over the next three to five years. The partnership was reported on the Web site of The Los Angeles Times. Ms. Hedstrom said that “La Didone” the Wooster Group’s cross-pollination of a 1641 opera and a 1965 horror film “Planet of the Vampires” would play at REDCAT from June 11 through 21 and that a production of Tennessee Williams’s “Vieux Carré” is scheduled there for February.
 9,The phenomenal success of Wal-Mart Stores can be traced in large part to the workrooms and factories of many of its suppliers including the Liberty Trouser Company a once-sleepy maker of work and hunting clothes.Its marriage with Wal-Mart has given Liberty a hot new business in Liberty-brand children's wear for Wal-Mart and that has led to the creation of a popular line of children's clothing called Circus Star for other retailers. Four Liberty sewing plants have been opened in northern Alabama in the last four years and Liberty's main offices here expanded recently into a new headquarters a refurbished Pontiac dealership. If business continues to grow apace Liberty may soon be bursting these walls too.For manufacturers like Liberty Wal-Mart's fast-spreading network of nearly 1800 discount stores in 36 states is a dream come true. Earlier this year Wal-Mart overtook Sears Roebuck & Company as the nation's leading retailer. It is adding 150 stores annually and last year rang up $32.6 billion in sales.Many suppliers and retailing experts think the close ties that Wal-Mart has with Liberty and its other suppliers is a reason the discounter has been able to continue its rapid growth grabbing market share in a business that was considered mature years ago.
 0,THE stalls at local farmers' markets are filling out like cornfields in July. Each week there are more choices even more farmers. As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. For each the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different. Exact market locations and times are at www.cenyc.org www.nyfarmersmarket.com and www.communitymarkets.biz.Greens Yes But Especially August CornSue and Henry Smith planned to be teachers. But Mr. Smith told his father a truck farmer in Rockland County in New York that he would farm too. He never left the land and he and his wife now own Sycamore Farms in Middletown N.Y. They grow strawberries peas and hothouse tomatoes but pride themselves most on their corn. It is picked the evening before they go to the Greenmarket and arrives in time for the market's opening. On Saturdays they bring a second batch at 10:30 a.m. They sell it earlier than most -- by the Fourth of July -- because they start some under plastic a sort of hothouse. Their season continues until the end of October or the first frost.AVAILABLE -- Mr. Smith said the corn after Aug. 1 has better flavor because it takes longer to mature. "For early corn you sacrifice eating quality for availability" he said.SELECTING -- Let them choose the ears for you but if you do it don't strip the leaves to inspect the kernels; it hastens the aging of the rejects. "Make sure there are no holes in the husk" Mrs. Smith said. "Then if you run your hand tightly down the outside you just want to feel a uniform cob with no indentations and skips." Drying on leaves or at the cut end mean the corn is not fresh.

 0,India's economy soared 10.4 percent in the final quarter of 2003 making it one of the fastest growing in the world even ahead of China.The last quarter's rise up from an 8.4 percent pace in the previous quarter was driven mainly by an expansion of nearly 17 percent in farm output. Last season the country benefited from the heaviest monsoon rains in over a decade. Farming accounts for a quarter of India's economy.The Center for Monitoring of the Indian Economy based in Mumbai said in its monthly review released Wednesday that overall gross domestic product earlier forecast at around 8 percent would probably be above 9 percent in the government's fiscal year ending this month.But the jump which makes India the fastest-growing Asian economy is unlikely to continue.''I would not get too excited about the double digits because there is a big skew in farm output this year which is unlikely to repeat'' said Jyotivardhan Jaipuria head of research at DSP Merrill Lynch.

 9,“I had seen how well couple of major studio films about the South had done” Mr. McClure recalls “so figured I could make me some money by doing a few myself especially if I turned out action thrillers filled with classic car chases a little spin some ‘shine some bigbellied sheriffs the usual Southernisms.”He rounded up some backers rented a few cameras and hired a handful of actors and technicians. Some of the technicians had no experience except what they had gained in college film courses.“The director had to come down from New York” Mr. McClure says “because somebody had to know what to do. The shooting took 16 days—about a fourth the normal time — and we brought the whole thing in for less than $65000 which would last Burt Reynolds and the ‘Gator’ cast about two days.“Man when it rained we just wrote that in the script.” he said. “And since we were basically using nonunion labor when we ran into an actor who belonged to the Screen Guild we just changed his name.”At last count. Mr. McClure reports “Preacherman” had grossed $5‐million in ticket sales. No one in New York or Chicago or Seattle has ever heard of the film‐or its stars who remain as obscure as ever—but “Preach” has played 10 separate dates in Sanford N.C. population 11716.“All the critics panned it and one even nominated it for ‘worst flick of the year'” Mr. McClure says with a chuckle.Mr. McClure followed “Preacherman” with “Hot Summer in Barefoot County” which was advertised as “hot rods hot lips and white lightning.” Then came “Truckin’ Man” a Southern study in “gear jammin' hell fightin’ and tender lovin'.”

 9,"Where's Gary?" said S. M. Pavement's lead singer and guitarist about two-thirds of the way through the band's set at Maxwell's on Tuesday night the first of two sold-out evenings. He looked around rather distractedly. Gary the drummer was nowhere to be seen. No one in the band seemed to know where he had gone or when he had left. Only mildly daunted S. M. nosed around the stage for a minute or two and the band attempted to go into an acoustic song. They had trouble getting it off the ground -- someone kept messing up and S. M. was starting to laugh -- but eventually they shuffled through. The bassist perhaps bored sat down on the drum stool and watched.Half rock-and-roll half circus of the absurd and all attitude Pavement's show set a new standard for lackadaisical cool on the underground rock scene (their unorthodox nomenclature is part of the mystique). The band's music draws on a conventional set of pre- and post-punk influences: Sonic Youth's calculated guitar noise and half-spoken vocals the Velvet Underground's thudding rhythms Dinosaur Jr.'s way of strangling a pop hook. When Pavement put a little effort into its performance its ingenuity was easily apparent. S. M. would push his voice into a derelict falsetto singing along with Spiral Stairs's primitive guitar lead and rolling his eyes; a second drummer flailed away on a heavy tom hitting slightly behind the beat and giving the rhythms a jagged 3-D quality.Most of the time though Pavement acted as if it just didn't care. Back in the 80's bands like the Replacements made a statement out of sloppiness putting on shows in which songs would go half-finished band members would change instruments and venerable rock gods like Led Zeppelin would be felled in drunken versions of their most famous songs. But where the Replacements were making a stand against the corpulence and conformity of mainstream rock Pavement is making a stand against making a stand. In the 90's no icons remain to be toppled (except maybe Nirvana whom S. M. cheerfully ridiculed). Pavement takes nothing seriously; antiprofessionalism is as much a joke as professionalism.Interestingly enough the attitude provided some good entertainment. What S. M. didn't seem to know when he asked "Where's Gary?" was that the drummer had already had a minor altercation. During "Here" a song from the band's debut album "Slanted and Enchanted" he was wailing away happily tossing sticks in the air between each beat. Then he apparently broke a piece of equipment. Gary got up from behind his kit stuck a cigarette in his mouth and began to walk offstage. Spiral Stairs stopped him turned him around and pushed him back toward his seat. After that Gary must have been looking for an opening a moment when no one was paying attention and he could sneak offstage.
 0,George T. Skibine an assistant secretary of economic development for Indian affairs at the Department of the Interior said that the dormant proposal for a Mohawk casino at the racetrack could be revived if the governor sent a letter concurring with his agency's findings in 2000 that the casino would be good for both the tribe and Sullivan County.Sheldon Silver the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly and Senator Joseph L. Bruno the Republican majority leader in the Senate said that it was up to Mr. Pataki to approve the latest Mohawk proposal since he has the authority to negotiate three casino deals in the Catskills under legislation approved in 2001.Despite the apparent support for a Mohawk casino construction is not necessarily going to begin anytime soon if ever. Gambling in the Catskills has been a political roller coaster with unending twists and turns and the racetrack is no exception.Empire Resorts and the Mohawks have been partners before. In the 1990's the tribe and the company formerly known as Alpha Hospitality proposed building a casino on 29 acres at the racetrack. Although casino gambling is illegal in New York it is permitted on Indian-owned land.But days after the Interior Department granted the project tentative approval in 2000 the Mohawks surprised supporters including Senator Charles E. Schumer when the tribe dropped its partners in favor of a large gambling company Park Place Entertainment.At that time executives at Park Place which has since merged with Harrah's Entertainment said they would obtain federal approval and build a Mohawk casino at Kutsher's Sports Academy outside Monticello. But that still has not happened.In 2001 the Legislature authorized Mr. Pataki to negotiate deals for three Indian casinos in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area and three in the Catskills which gambling enthusiasts viewed as a plum location because of its proximity to New York City.
 9,Two United States Navy warships the cruiser Gettysburg and the frigate Halyburton were heading towards the tanker to take the survivors on aboard Daphne Osborne the owners' South African agent said in Cape Town. Two helicopters dropped medicines and supplies to the Hawaiian King.What was to have been a sun-kissed cruise across the equator ended some 150 miles off the coast of Somalia when the fire broke out. According to survivors and shipping officials the ship's engines stopped abruptly.The vessel stirred debate last June when Italy's neo-Fascist National Alliance chartered her for a fund-raising cruise in the Mediterranean and in response to adverse criticism dropped a wreath into the sea in memory of Mr. Klinghoffer.But for many Italians the vessel was "The Big Blue Liner" named for the color of her hull that plied the oceans from North America to Australia and once went around the world in 80 days despite a chronicle of calamities.Today's was not even the ship's first fire. In 1981 a blaze erupted aboard the Achille Lauro in the Canary Islands and two passengers drowned when they jumped overboard. In 1961 she hit a fishing vessel and killed a Neapolitan fisherman.Some passengers were wearing ball gowns and tuxedos when the alarm was raised today said Tony Webb a British businessman who had been aboard and who told his story by radio-phone to The Evening Standard of London."We were alerted at 1:30 A.M. when we heard the engines suddenly shut off" he said. "Most people were at this social event and the captain came on and said we all had to go up on deck because there was a fire."
 9,''If we don't get anywhere in committee'' he said ''then we'll try to take the fight to the floor. We think we have enough votes to do that for sure because all you need is a quarter of the platform committee or six state delegations.''In recent months Mr. Wilson and Mr. Weld have been in contact with other party moderates about the abortion issue among them Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Asked how many other governors and leading party moderates could be expected to join the fight for the substitute plank Mr. Wilson replied ''We'll begin to see now that we have a plank to propose.''Governor Whitman's office said she was on vacation in Alaska and would have no immediate comment.Mr. Wilson said that the Dole campaign was told earlier this week of the plan to offer the substitute but that ''I don't know what they intend to do with it.''Mr. Dole after considerable backing and filling recently tried to head off any embarrassing convention split on abortion. He proposed that the party retain its long-standing anti-abortion plank but also add a tolerance plank which would welcome party members who have ''deeply held and sometimes differing views on issues of personal conscience like abortion.''After the wording of the suggested substitute plank was released today the Dole campaign released the following statement: ''Bob Dole's long and consistent pro-life record is as strong as his belief that the Republican Party is an inclusive party. The issue of platform language is one that will ultimately be decided by the platform committee.''

 0,Since its inception FOIA has rightly been denounced as a weak and ineffective law but The Times continues to aggressively pursue documents through the statute doing what we have done repeatedly over the past 15 years: going to court to challenge the government’s refusal to release materials that the public should see. The Times has brought more FOIA suits over the last decade than any other mainstream media organization in the country.A study by the nonprofit group TRAC found that The Times had filed 31 FOIA lawsuits during the Obama years. Our peer news organizations around the country — the major newspapers wire services and broadcasters — filed 10 collectively. A subsequent TRAC study found that The Times continued to be the leading filer among media organizations over the first year and a half of the Trump administration. The Times has now filed 27 FOIA lawsuits in the Trump years. (A handful of public interest groups and newer media outlets in particular BuzzFeed and the Center for Public Integrity have also been out front in pursuing litigation.)So why do we devote so much time to trying to make a deeply flawed law work?It’s not because it’s easy. Our FOIA litigation is done in house by our now three-lawyer team with our First Amendment Fellow Al-Amyn Sumar playing the pivotal role. We have been helped in several cases by a FOIA clinic at Yale Law School. We spend hundreds of hours each year filing the suits writing briefs negotiating with government lawyers and going to court. We know better than anyone that FOIA cases are frustrating; the deck is stacked against us and the lawsuits drag on for months and years.But one part of our motivation is pretty simple: We manage to win documents. Between successful court decisions and settlements in which the agencies agree to reverse course and give us documents we regularly make a small dent in governmental secrecy.In the past year we have assisted our reporters in unlocking documents on topics ranging from gun control and herbicides to foreign lobbyists and federal land disputes in the West. In June The Times published a report about Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s efforts to include her relatives in meetings during an official trip to China in October of 2017. Emails obtained through a FOIA lawsuit showed that the trip had been canceled after ethics concerns were raised with officials in the State and Transportation Departments.

 0,We’ll be posting our World Club rankings periodically over the course of the season a look at how the leading teams in the eight best pro hockey leagues across the planet would rate against one another. Theoretically of course.An explanation of the headings and methodology appears underneath the rankings. But first here is the current World Club Top 10 reflecting results through Saturday night’s games:…….club (league)………………………..gp w/o d o/l pts pct rtng..1. Salavat Yulaev Ufa (RUS)….32 25/0 x 3/4 78 .812 44.7..2. HV71 Jonkoping (SWE)……..25 17/1 3 0/4 57.5 .767 42.2..3. SC Bern (SUI)…………………….27 19/2 x 3/3 64 .790 41.9..4t Slavia Prague (CZE)………….26 17/3 x 2/4 59 .756 40.8..4t Slovan Bratislava (SVK)……30 20/3 x 2/5 68 .756 40.8..6. Karpat Oulu (FIN)……………..28 16/5 x 2/5 60 .714 39.3..7. Eisbären Berlin (GER)……….25 17/2 x 0/6 55 .733 38.9..8. Detroit Red Wings (NHL)….26 15/3 x 2/6 53 .679 38.4..9. SKA St. Petersburg (RUS) …32 20/3 x 0/9 66 .688 37.810. Espoo Blues (FIN)……………..26 16/1 x 3/6 53 .679 37.4The headings are: the club and the league it plays in; games played (gp); wins in 60 minutes worth 3 points and wins in overtime or by shootout worth 2 (w/o); draws which happen only in Sweden and are worth 1.5 points (d); losses in overtime or by shootout worth 1 point and losses in 60 minutes worth 0 (o/l); total points earned (pts); points percentage (pct); and the team’s overall rating (rtng). Each league is assigned a certain level of strength based on how well the league’s clubs have done in international tournaments and how well the nation has done in international competitions and those levels figure into the mathematical formula. The NHL is by itself at the top level; the Russian Swedish and Finnish leagues occupy the second level; the Czech and Slovak leagues the third level; and the Swiss and German levels the fourth level.So when you look at the line for the No. 1 club Salavat Yulaev from the city of Ufa in the Russian Superliga you see that they’ve played 32 games won 25 in regulation and 0 in overtime or shootout have an “x” in the draw column because there are no tie games in Russia lost 3 in overtime or shootout and another 4 in regulation all for a total of 78 points which is 81.2 percent of the points available to them. All that is good for a rating of 44.7 best in the world.When we first published these rankings last December and put the Finnish club Karpat Oulu at No. 1 we got pilloried by the superb and extremely useful French Web site hockeyarchives.com. “Meilleur club de hockey au monde ! C’est le titre que le prestigieux New York Times a décerné au Kärpät Oulu peu avant Noël” the site announced and even if you can’t read French you should be able to intuit the contempt that seeps across language barriers. “Par un étrange classement aux règles quelque peu basiques le club finlandais y devançait Ak Bars Kazan et les Anaheim Ducks ! Venant d’un Européen un tel résultat aurait été jugé osé et ridiculisé.”You can hardly blame hockeyarchives.com whose coverage of the European game is comprehensive smart funny and generally terrific — they’ve been writing about continental hockey for a long time and they’re well aware that it’s a stretch to claim that a top European club is better than a top NHL club.But as hockeyarchives also pointed out the idea of an American comparing European teams with NHL teams is a bit different. And indeed it is — mainly because in Canada and the U.S. there has traditionally been so little recogniton of European club hockey.For so many years the phrases you’d hear from the hockey commentators and experts on this side of the Atlantic were simply “he played in Sweden” or “he spent a season in the Russian elite league”. No names of clubs no awareness that almost all those clubs are much older and have a much deeper sense of tradition that almost every NHL franchise no inkling that fans in Europe’s small rinks are far more raucous and passionate than the anesthetized fans in the NHL’s cavernous arenas.Even when European players would arrive on these shores and immediately constitute 75 percent of the NHL’s top scorers’ list large chunks of all-star teams and skate with and sometimes past the national teams of Canada and (far more often) the US as they have done for a generation or two North American commentators still didn’t bother to learn about the clubs and leagues that made those players.Fortunately that’s begun to change thanks mainly to the Internet and now you’ll actually see Canadian and American newspaper articles that contains words like “Metallurg Magnitogorsk”. Well occasionally. Nevertheless the idea that a European club might really be good enough to give a tough game to an NHL team is still too much for a lot of North American hockey types to bear.But sports fans here ought to know better at least those whose memories or knowledge extends to the AFL’s upsets of the NFL in the late ’60s Super Bowls or the USSR’s upsets of top Canadian teams in the ’70s and ’80s or international basketball teams’ upsets of US Olympic teams in the late ’90s or the teams that beat the Americans in the World Baseball Classic just last year or any other example of unknown and supposedly inferior teams shocking famous ones. Really there is no question that the top European teams belong on the same ice as the top NHL teams — as we shall finally see this September when the Victoria Cup finally ushers in a new era of Europe-vs.-NHL club competition.That’s why we do these rankings and each time we post one we’ll look at one of the European teams in it. And we’ll learn lots about Bashkortostan stoats and lighting hundreds of road flares in a crowded arena when your team takes the ice we promise.
 0,For years the pattern had struck many people in the boxing business as fishy. One after another Colombian fighters with almost no experience outside Colombia would appear out of nowhere rise rapidly up the International Boxing Federation's rankings and get a shot at a title. Most of them then lost the title fight and disappeared.Carlos Mercado a junior bantamweight of little renown rose to the No. 1 contender's spot then was soundly beaten by the champion Robert Quiroga in 1992. Felix Naranjo a miniflyweight also ascended rapidly to contender's status and got a 1993 title fight against the champion Ratanapol Vorapin of Thailand who knocked him out in two rounds.Miguel Julio became the top lightweight contender in 1995 with dubious credentials and persuaded the I.B.F. to order the champion at the time Oscar De La Hoya to fight him. But De La Hoya gave up the I.B.F. belt instead saying the match would be an embarrassment. Julio was later whipped by Philip Holliday a lower-ranked South African.The boxing insiders' suspicions now have firm support. The Colombian fighters' manager Ivan Feris Chadid said in a sworn affidavit that he had paid dozens of bribes from 1989 to 1997 to I.B.F. officials to advance his fighters in the rankings.

 0,The grisly death of real estate developer Andrew Kissel has gripped the wealthy community of Greenwich Conn. where he lived and brought back memories of the highly publicized death of his brother who had been a prominent banker for Goldman Sachs and then Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.In this week’s cover story New York Magazine recounts the history of the Kissel family offering a long and sordid tale of greed lust and fraud.The banker Robert Kissel was murdered by his wife. And early last month his brother Andrew was found dead after being charged with fraud in three states. Recriminations continue among the surviving family members.Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the story is the fate of the five children at the center of it all. As portrayed in the article they were used as pawns in an ongoing game of petty squabbling among the adults they know best. Two of them lost one parent while three lost a parent and saw another go to prison. One unknowingly fed her father narcotics in a milkshake so that her mother could bludgeon him to death.Go to Article from New York Magazine
 9,The Essex County Prosecutor's office today began investigating a melee that erupted as police officers tried to break up a teen-agers' holiday party at a home here early Sunday.The disturbance led to 10 arrests including that of Amiri Baraka the poet and playwright and a heavy police response that startled residents of the normally quiet neighborhood at the northern end of Montclair Avenue.Officials said all phases of the incident would be reviewed."We're trying to determine exactly what happened" said Raymond Weiss a spokesman for Prosecutor Herbert H. Tate. "We're reviewing reports and questioning as many witnesses as we can find." Complaints of NoiseTwo police officers and one partygoer identified as Mr. Baraka's 18-year-old son Amiri Jr. suffered minor injuries as the officers responding to complaints about excessive noise went to the home and tried to disperse the youths officials said. The police estimated that more than 100 people were at the party.

 9,To the Editor:When Brent Staples (Editorial Observer March 29) describes students in a San Francisco school as ''almost 90 percent minority'' he reveals the absurdity of both our terms for and ways of thinking about cultural diversity in the United States.In conventional use ''minority'' refers to the smaller of two groups. In the past it may have been accurate to describe nonwhite non-northern and non-Western Europeans as a numerical minority. Today the sheer plurality of national origins and skin colors in the United States ought to show us how inadequate our dualistic conception is. Maybe it's time for a new paradigm.MARTI FRANKCambridge Mass. March 30 1998

 9,Mike Tyson apologized to Evander Holyfield yesterday for biting his opponent's ears during their bout Saturday night saying that the prospect of losing because of a head butt by Holyfield made him react aberrantly.''I just snapped and reacted the way many athletes have done and paid the price for it'' he said reading from a statement at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas Nev. the site of Saturday night's World Boxing Association heavyweight title fight. ''I couldn't tell you why I acted exactly as I did.''For an athlete in the heat of battle to lose it is not new but it isn't right.''In contrast to the histrionic defense he made Saturday night after he was disqualified following the third round Tyson offered a meek face yesterday one day before the Nevada State Athletic Commission starts to deliberate on his punishment.Tyson whose right eyelid was heavily swollen said he expected the commission to hand down a severe penalty. ''I only ask that it's not a penalty for life'' he said.

 9,WASHINGTON June 2—The House considering a bill to establish a Department of Energy defeated a major proposal of the Carter Administration by refusing today to give the head of the new department the authority to set natural gas prices.Republicans who argued that the move would give one man too much power voted overwhelmingly In support of an amendment that would put that pricing authority in a new independent Federal commission.There was no major opposition to the concept of a single department to deal with the nation's energy problems but the vote on this amendment showed that the House like the Senate earlier had reservations about a sweeping grant of power over natural gas pricing on which the Administration's policy is regarded as unclear.With a long list of amendments before it the House could not complete work on the bill tonight but was expected to pass it tomorrow. It will then go to a conference with the Senate which adopted a somewhat different price‐setting mechanism.

 9,In some ways the Clash of the Titans tour that arrived on Friday night at Madison Square Garden could be the belated triumph of punk-rock. As Anthrax Slayer and Megadeth played a full house at least two-thirds of whom were wearing black T-shirts shouted along with lines like Anthrax's "You're anti -- you're antisocial!" or "Ain't gonna live my life this way!" From a more cynical viewpoint it was an example of rebellion as commodity standardized in sound (a pummeling beat minor chords chantlike vocals) appearance (long hair jeans and T-shirts or bare chests) and action (flopping that long hair to the beat).But for all its commercialism the music known as thrash or speed-metal has genuine power. The beat and guitars simultaneously hyperactive and one-dimensional are a perfect musical metaphor for enraged frustration while speed-metal lyrics don't bother with any of pop's consolations like love. During the four-hour concert fans stomped and shouted along with lyrics about fighting racism (Anthrax's "Keep It in the Family") censorship (Megadeth's "Hook in Mouth") or dying on the battlefield (Slayer's "Mandatory Suicide"). Thrash recognizes and tries to exorcise the malevolent powers that greet adolescents on the verge of adulthood often with lyrics that switch from the perspective of victim to victimizer. In concert words are often lost in the roar but that hardly matters; fans have learned them from the albums' lyric sheets.While the music has strict parameters each band adds its own shadings. Anthrax is least hemmed in by thrash conventions. There's a certain jaunty Little Rascals aura to the band as members race around the stage and the lead singer Joe Belladonna works the crowd like a cheerleader. Anthrax's guitarist Scott Ian has a shaved head and baggy shorts that come from the wardrobe of hardcore rock; Anthrax also ventures into styles outside thrash including the pop of Joe Jackson's "Got the Time" the rap of "I'm a Man" (which sounds like a Beastie Boys imitation) and a new effort a version of Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" with blaring guitar backup. For the encore Anthrax was joined by Chuck D. and Flavor-Flav of Public Enemy who leaped around the stage to rival the members of Anthrax.Where Anthrax is relatively eclectic Slayer is purist; it plays pounding crushing thrash -- half-speed regular and double-time -- behind Tom Araya's savage growl while its lead guitars wail between verses. Slayer has a gimmick; it writes about death and Satanic rituals piling on horrific details but neither praising nor condemning them with lines like "I rule this inferno/Enthroned for eternity."

 0,LUBBOCK Tex. — Three hours before their game Saturday night against top-ranked Texas a large group of Texas Tech players sat in the lounge area of a Holiday Inn.The Red Raiders had stayed at the hotel Friday night as they traditionally do for home games.Now in the moments before they traveled to the stadium to prepare to take on the Longhorns they were attentively watching college football on television.But even with the much-hyped game between No. 5 Florida and No. 8 Georgia playing on a nearby television the players were focused on No. 9 Oklahoma State’s 59-17 rout of Iowa State.The reason was very simple.Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma State (8-1 4-1 Big 12) next Saturday. Texas Tech has won 8 of the last 11 meetings between the teams.The Red Raiders have also won their last 11 home games against the Cowboys. Oklahoma State’s last victory here came in 1944.
 0,In fact levels of growth hormone in the fish are so low Mr. Matheson said that the Food and Drug Administration will not require one particular set of tests -- feeding the salmon to rodents -- that are typical for new drugs for animals.''You can't choke rats with enough salmon to cause an effect other than choking'' he said. Some scientists not involved with the company also pointed out that fish growth hormone was unlikely to have an effect on humans.The salmon do not even grow to be unusually large Dr. Fletcher said as even 7-year-old salmon at AquAdvantage have never weighed more than 17 pounds large but far from record-breaking for the species.Mr. Entis also said that the new fish taste just like other salmon grown on farms.Some scientists not involved with the company also played down food safety concerns but said it would be important to know for example if the foreign growth hormone triggered increased production of other compounds like insulinlike growth factors. Mr. Entis of A/F Protein said the company had been asked to look into that question and others as part of the continuing Food and Drug Administration review.Environmental Safety'What If' Situations Are StudiedSalmon are typically grown in enclosures in the sea known as net pens renowned for being torn by waves or hungry wild animals. Fish routinely escape sometimes by the tens of thousands. If the genetically engineered or transgenic fish are grown in such pens some will eventually slip out into the wild some researchers say.If they do wild fish could be potentially devastated according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in November by Dr. William Muir a population geneticist and Dr. Richard Howard an aquatic ecologist both at Purdue University.The two researchers studied mating and survivorship in normal and genetically engineered versions of a fish known as a medaka. Using this information researchers developed a computer model simulating the escape of a genetically modified fish into the wild. The study showed that if wild females preferred to mate with genetically engineered males and if those matings produced offspring that did not survive well wild populations could be wiped out a result they called the Trojan gene effect.

 9,Bridge and other intellectual games are excluded from the Olympics but the organizers of the Goodwill Games in Seattle have proved more flexible. Twenty-five Soviet players are there and will compete today and tomorrow against players from the Seattle area.The visitors are more relaxed than they were a week ago. Their sports committee had provided them with tickets to Seattle but return tickets only from New York to Moscow. A lot of goodwill from T.W.A. and the bridge community solved most of the problem and the Goodwill players will not have to walk across North America. Some hospitality is needed for their visit to New York City next week. For information call Henry Bethe president of the Greater New York Bridge Association (212) 552-6262.One visitor Vasily Levenko of Tallinn Estonia came to the Summer Nationals in Boston last week. Playing with Val Mashkin a Soviet emigre living in Stratford Conn. he did well in the Red Ribbon Pairs. On the diagramed deal from an earlier event they defended a tricky three no-trump contract.South would have had an easy task after a club or a heart lead but West chose a spade. South won in dummy went to the diamond queen and led a club to the jack. East won and shifted to the heart nine covered with the ten and won with the queen. Another low spade lead was won with the king and South was at the crossroads.

 9,The athletes seem to be making the most of their second chance.According to Mr. Burnham players entering the N.F.L. without a degree had a mean grade point average of 1.9 in college but those who resume their studies achieve a 3.2.For players motivations vary. Donnie Edwards a linebacker with the Kansas City Chiefs who recently polished off his master's in education administration at the University of California at Los Angeles cites a boyhood visit to the home of a well-to-do family where he was told that a college degree was the way to a big house and a white picket fence. Others see it as key to their stature as role models or as a fallback for their life after football -- no small consideration given that the average duration of a pro football career is three and a half years to say nothing of the hazards of a profession where one injury can lead to abrupt career displacement.''Football is a small window in your life'' said the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy who encourages bench warmers and high-profile athletes alike to finish college. A few Buccaneers have even taken classes in-season which is fine with Mr. Dungy. ''As long as it didn't jeopardize what he had to do on the field I wouldn't be against it.''Here are five players who went the whole nine yards.KEN NORTON JR.Between them Ken Norton Jr. and his father have won three Super Bowls and boxing's heavyweight championship of the world. But no man in the Norton family could call himself a college graduate until this past June when the younger Norton 12 years removed from his starring days at U.C.L.A. returned to the university and received his diploma as his father wife and three children watched.Mr. Norton 32 a gifted linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers who holds the team record for the most tackles in a single season (165) said a feeling gnawed at him as he raised his children.

Play ing here is a goal he has long held but a National Invitation Tournament bid hinges on the Tigers posting a respectable record.

Maravich scored 53 points 13 more than he needed to break the scoring record of 2973 amassed by Oscar Robertson at the University of Cincinnati from 1957–60. Pete has 2987.As the home capacity crowd of 11000 chanted “One more one more” when he came close to the record Maravich dazzled 'Ole Miss with his fa mous push‐shot jumpers head fakes and moving crossover dribbles under his legs.

Russell Sherman is one of the most technically formidable and musically probing pianists of our time. That said his strong interpretive ideas frequently divide listeners. But he is always an interesting artist. This weekend as part of the rewarding Monadnock Music festival based in Peterborough N.H. Mr. Sherman will perform all five Beethoven piano concertos on two programs with the Monadnock Music Festival Orchestra conducted by James Bolle. Tonight he plays the first three concertos. On Sunday afternoon he offers the fourth and fifth. The performances are being recorded for future commercial release. Monadnock Music Festival. Peterborough Town House Grove and Main Streets Peterborough N.H. Tonight at 8: Beethoven Piano Concertos Nos. 1 to 3; Sunday at 4 p.m.: Beethoven Piano Concertos Nos. 4 and 5. Tickets: $16 to $28; (603) 924-7610 (Tommasini).MUSIC MOUNTAIN. It is hard to see why this attractive chamber-music festival in its 71st season has not developed a higher profile. Here the Shanghai String Quartet offers two juicy programs (including music by Mozart Beethoven Shostakovich and Bright Sheng) and is joined by the pianist Ruth Laredo in a work of Brahms to end each. Tomorrow it is Brahms's G-minor Piano Quartet which these performers played impressively eight years ago at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and on Sunday it is Brahms's great and formidable Piano Quintet. A preconcert event ''The Return of the Canine Quadrille'' at 2 on Sunday is described as ''a congenial group of dogs dancing with their human partners.'' (Well let's think again about that profile.)

Sunday at 8 p.m. Capitol West Lawn Washington (202) 467-4600 or (800) 444-1324. Admission: free (Oestreich).SKANEATELES FESTIVAL. Now that most other summer festivals have pulled up stakes it may be time to dig out the map and start exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles near Syracuse this event is directed by Diane Walsh a pianist. Tonight Ms. Walsh spars with the theatrical comic Bill Irwin in spoofs including ''The Page Turner'' which for longtime concertgoers let alone some of us forcibly retired page turners may be hard put to rival real and legendary disasters. Tomorrow Peter Bay conducts the festival orchestra to close the season with -- what else? -- Haydn's ''Farewell'' Symphony (though surely to savor the exquisite joke of the players dispersing a few at a time the work should come at the end of the program not before intermission) along with Mozart arias and Schubert's Fifth Symphony. Tonight at 8 Skaneateles High School East Elizabeth Street; tomorrow night at 8 Brook Farm Route 41A south of Skaneateles (315) 685-7418.

 9,The Postal Service finished the fiscal year 1987 with a loss of more than $200 million emphasizing the need for the higher rates expected to take effect next spring Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch said today.While the final accounting has not been completed preliminary results indicate that the Postal Service losses will range from $200 million to $225 million Mr. Tisch said at a National Press Club breakfast. The agency completed its fiscal year last Saturday.The Postmaster General added that while he would continue to urge postal managers to hold spending down he expected the agency's losses to reach $400 million in the current fiscal year.Anticipating those losses the Postal Service earlier this year filed for higher rates which would raise the cost of a first-class stamp from 22 cents to 25 cents.

 9,After years of battling for equal recognition graduates of foreign medical schools may soon be able to take the same test in basic and clinical sciences that is given to graduates of American medical schools.The National Board of Medical Examiners developed and administers the tests to students of medical schools in the United States to certify them before licensing by the states. It decided last month to consider offering the major parts of its examination to graduates of foreign medical schools.Dr. Robert Volle president of the board said that with the change about 20000 more people would take the national board's examination each year.The graduates of foreign medical schools many of them Americans now take a separate examination administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates the foreign graduates' equivalent of the national board. The educational commission supported the national board's decision when it met later last month. Both organizations are in Philadlephia. Joint Panel to Make Decision The national board had said the separate tests were needed because the board did not have enough information on the curriculums of medical schools in foreign countries. The two groups will form a joint committee to decide whether to abolish the separate examination for foreign graduates and to arrange to give the national board exam on the same days to the 20000 more candidates around the world. The change could come as early as next year Dr. Volle said.

He injured his right shoulder in the second round.''That was one of the most courageous performances I've ever seen'' said Johnny Bos a New York fight manager who watched the bout on HBO. ''That's the kind of thing that gives credence to this game that makes it worthwhile.''Fighters have been injured and kept going many times; it happens almost every time Arturo Gatti and Floyd Mayweather Jr. fight. But Chavez who did not seem to have a chance to win after the opening round when he hurt Morales with a right hand to the chin showed special grit.
 0,Bill O’Reilly is on the warpath again accusing me of writing about Darfur as a career-advancement tool and saying that Iraq and Darfur are all the same — if you support intervention for one then you should support it for the other.I won’t address the notion that I wade into war zones for self-advancement except to say that during World War II my newspaper blew coverage of the Holocaust. The Times published 24000 articles on our front page and of those only six referred directly on the front page part to Nazi attacks on Jews. We blew it then and I don’t want to make the same mistake in this genocide.Then there’s the issue of Iraq. It’s true that in earlier periods such as the 1980’s Iraq had waged a genocidal campaign against Kurds — and that would have been an argument for military intervention. And in fact there eventually was belated military intervention in the form of no-fly zones that we enforced in Kurdistan barring Saddam from entering Kurdish areas. I do think that when a genocide is underway there should be some kind of intervention.But that doesn’t mean American intervention. I don’t want to see U.S. troops go into Darfur any more than I want to see U.S. troops in Iraq. I was against the US invasion of Iraq for many reasons but one of them was the way that would inflame Arab nationalism; for the same reason I think it would be a mistake to send American ground troops into Darfur. But a genocide is currently underway in Darfur in a way that it certainly was not in Iraq in 2003 and that does call for international intervention. That’s why I’d like to see a U.N. force with some Nato contingent and a large number of Muslim troops from Turkey Morocco Bangladesh and Pakistan.Moreover the biggest difference is this: Ordinary Iraqis didn’t want US troops to invade in 2003. Ordinary Darfuris are begging foreign troops to come in today. And in any case it won’t be an invasion because there’ll be enough international pressure on Sudan that it will at the last minute grudgingly accept the international presence.So Bill you understand the distinction? If not then come with me to Darfur. Take me up on my invitation. Times readers sponsored your visit raising $700000 for you to visit Darfur and see genocide for yourself. And once you’ve seen the dead kids and raped women you won’t have to fulminate against me; you’ll have a much more worthy target to rant against something entirely appropriate for your rage.

 9,Ah yes we all remember. We remember everything. I do and it is not because I'm especially sentimental. (The beige silk taffeta went to the Salvation Army a long time ago.) It is as if a hammer and chisel wielded by . . . the fates maybe . . . had pounded the scene into my brain. Let me call it up and I see the chilly December day the gray-haired judge the fireplace banked in red carnations and my darker red shoes. Capezios. I see the groom in dark blue and his hands which were sporting the first manicure he ever had. I had a manicure too my fourth and last. Three high school junior proms one wedding: no gala since has matched those four. Ergo no more manicures.The champagne was in the bathtub two dozen bottles or so heaped on big chunks of ice and my roommate and I had iced the petits fours ourselves. My new sister-in-law had done the flowers and an hour or two before the ceremony my mother had gone to Bergdorf's the store nearest her hotel to buy me a blue garter. My sister's bouquet - she was maid of honor - trembled in her hand and the wedding cake was a disappointment. I had wanted a fruit cake; this was a white cake. Like I said I - we - remember everything.My younger daughter imagines her wedding - ''Long white dress band and a professional makeup job'' she snaps - and is much in demand as a bridesmaid. Her college classmates are getting married now and I suppose she will be among them one of these days. Their weddings are elaborate and expensive and followed by sit-down dinners - none of this standing in a meadow and promising ''so long as we both shall dig it'' stuff. ''You'll get no such nonsense from me'' I promise. ''Only watercress sandwiches and a harpist.'' I mean it too.But I'll buy her a blue garter anyway and be wet-eyed when I see her in her dress (''off-the-shoulder with a little waist'' she tells me). After the guests are gone I'll get into my old gray bathrobe and take out the old photograph albums and breathe a sigh of relief - that my child is settled down at last. Which is stupid of me because it is decades since marriage was equivalent to settling down at last and because it is a relationship about which I am to say the least ambivalent.My ambivalence is less out of my own experience than out of what I perceive of others' experience. But I cannot quite trust these perceptions because no outsider can penetrate the wall that surrounds somebody else's marriage. Even so too often I do not like what I see.

 9,These days we have seen it all on the Discovery Channel. And the Amazonians have seen us. Now they wear jeans and Reebok knockoffs and take aspirin instead of leaves for a headache. The new exhibition contains 6000 plants most from the Americas where most of the garden's botanists work and many of the new specimens come from their cuttings and seeds. It also tries the near-impossible task of digesting the collision of the two worlds these scientists regularly traverse.It's a noble pursuit but I miss some of the old jumble. There were so many plants crowding against the 90-foot-high ceiling of the central dome it was like the Heart of Darkness. There were no signs to help the uninitiated though the inquisitive could usually find the plant's metal tag with its Latin name by rummaging in the bushes. The rain dripping from the canopy was not the artful aftermath of a tropical rain -- as it is now -- but actual rain leaking through the glass. There was a wonderful gloom a bit of decay that lent the mystery of the unknown: the kind of unfathomable wild place that haunted Joseph Conrad and all those other colonialists.But now one is ''immersed'' (to use a catchword of environmental education) in a journey through plants that are used as teaching tools. One cannot help but learn from the sign by the cycad in the central dome that this early seed-bearing plant once roamed the world with the dinosaurs. Visitors carrying Acoustiguides which look like cellular telephones can hear from botanists in the field: how the weevils that pollinate these cycads are being destroyed by pesticides and development or how a graceful palm that once thrived in Bolivia is being wiped out by the world's appetite for its succulent hearts of palm.Botanists are the new heroes and they are pictured a bit too often outside their flooded tents crawling across tree branches in the Andes (collecting seeds and cuttings of wild blueberries for the Agriculture Department) taking notes as shamans tell the secrets of medicinal plants. But the plants are the true stars from the exquisite to the weird.The visitor can stand under the cecropia tree in the lowland rain forest and watch the light falling through its giant starlike leaves then read how its leaves are steeped in tea to treat high blood pressure and diabetes. Or stare if no one else is looking at the mottled malodorous testicle-like flowers on the vines of an aristolochia or Dutchman's pipe.There is a strange sense of deja vu along the way as if the familiar house plants from Grandmother's had suddenly grown to the size of Volkswagen bugs -- in exuberant flower. This is part of the plan.''We wanted a great variety but also common things people could relate to'' said Francisca Coelho the curator of tropical plants who over the last four years has propagated thousands of plants.
 9,By the time Mr. Hallstrom Ms. Robinson and Mr. Dunne finally managed to get together -- not in Stockholm not in New York but in Los Angeles -- Mr. Hallstrom said he had read the script by Malia Scotch Marmo a native of East Boston who was brought up in Wakefield Mass. by Italian-American parents. "I really liked it" he said. "It was one of the few scripts I could imagine myself directing. It was sort of European-style it had low-key comedy touches to it and the dialogue was very real and funny. You could tell it was a personal story and I really liked the blend of comedy and drama."But there was a hitch.Mr. Hallstrom was committed to making a film of "Peter Pan." He spent a year in preproduction work but the film was never made. In the summer of 1988 he said he worked with Ms. Scotch Marmo on polishing the script in the expectation of starting to shoot "Once Around" in the beginning of 1989. But the cast which finally came to include Danny Aiello Gena Rowlands and Laura San Giacomo as well as Mr. Dreyfuss and Ms. Hunter could not be completed.Mr. Hallstrom then worked on "Mermaids" for a while.Finally last January filming of "Once Around" started in Boston and continued in St. Martin and in Wilmington N.C. where interiors were shot."It was a wonderful experience" Mr. Hallstrom said. Now he is in Stockholm taking a break from reading scripts and "sort of fiddling with a script of my own." Honor for De NiroRobert De Niro is to be honored at the annual Salute of the American Museum of the Moving Image.Serving as co-hosts of the event are Martin Scorsese the director of many of Mr. De Niro's films including the current "Goodfellas" and Robin Williams Mr. De Niro's co-star in the current "Awakenings."

 9,THE raucous cheering from behind the ivy-covered wall had long since given way to polite applause and this was the surest sign that Boris Becker was on his way out on Center Court. On Court 5 one long mis-hit away from tennis's most hallowed turf Alexandra Stevenson was completing a Houdini-like performance that was Becker's trademark when he first won Wimbledon in 1985.''Did Becker win?'' asked Stevenson qualifier-turned-quarterfinalist having barely survived a match point and outlasting Lisa Raymond in three sets. ''I hope he did.''Becker was at that moment misplaying his last Wimbledon point a backhand half-volley wide and surrendering to Patrick Rafter in straight sets. With a shrug and a smile the likable German said farewell to the court that 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson has dreamed of playing on since she was the 9-year-old charge of Pete Fischer Pete Sampras's former coach.Discounting the proximity of Court 5 and that this is her first Wimbledon main draw Stevenson said ''I've never been close.'' She won't make Center Court today in her quarterfinal match against Jelena Dokic but Stevenson can count on remaining in the middle of deepening intrigue. Her coming-out party as a tennis professional has turned sadly into an enervating inquiry on race and sex.
 0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson explore first-hand accounts and pictures of refugees focusing initially on child refugees in Chechnya. They then create collages that describe through words and images the experience of refugees in countries at war.Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Imagine what it might be like to be a refugee from a country at war; explore words that convey the feelings they might have from such an experience.2. Learn how Chechen children are finding refuge in Russia by attending special summer camps by reading and discussing “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War.”3. Explore the experiences of refugees in various countries; create collages for a museum exhibit entitled “The Refugee Experience.”4. Individually reflect on the experience of refugees in one country; develop a short creative work that expresses the thoughts and feelings of refugees from that country.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-classroom board-copies of “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War” (one per student)-resources about refugee experiences around the world (global history textbooks encyclopedias periodicals computers with Internet access)-poster board (one per small group)-markers colored pencils tape or glue sticks (enough for each small group)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: Students respond to the following scenario in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “Imagine that you have lived your entire life in a country at war. Many of your relatives have been in the war. Some have died. Others have fled. You and your immediate family are now forced to flee. Write five words that describe how you might feel.” Ask students to share their responses record their words on the board. Group related concepts. Then as a class discuss the following questions: Can we know what such an experience would be like without experiencing it ourselves? Can poetry or works of art communicate this experience? What are some images or phrases that come to mind that might better convey what these individual words are meant to evoke?2. As a class read and discuss “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War” focusing on the following questions:a. Who are the guests in a Russian village near Nizhy Novgorod and why are they there?b. What will these guests do in this village?c. Why is it unusual for Russians to show “such kindness” to Chechens? d. What human rights groups have helped make this experience possible for Chechen children?e. What does Dr. Maria Tarakanova mean when she says “But Russians can be the same”?f. According to the article who are some of the other children of the war in Chechnya?g. Why would were some of the soldiers described by Maryam Kurkayeva ashamed to accept the food she offered?h. How many Chechen children might spend time at Russian camps this year according to Russian officials cited in the article? Why are there so many?i. According to the article how many residents of Nizhny Novgorod opposed the camps? What reasons does the article give for why sentiments have changed?j. What background into the war in Chechnya is offered in this article? What information do you still want to learn about it?3. Divide the class into pairs or small groups of four and assign each group a country with a large population of refugees. Suggested countries include (but are not limited to) Bosnia Cambodia Chechnya Kosovo Sudan Tibet and Vietnam. Explain to students that each group will be acting as co-curators in a museum exhibit entitled “The Refugee Experience.” Each group will use a collection of words and images to create a collage poster that describe the experience of refugees in their assigned country. Using all available classroom resources one or two students in each group will be responsible for finding images that depict the refugee experience in this country [you may want to direct students to the New York Times photo section (//www.nytimes.com/photos). The other one or two students will be responsible for finding personal stories from voice recordings and written accounts from refugees from their assigned country [you may want to refer students to the Refugee Voices archive at the U.S. Committee for Refugees (//www.refugees.org/field/listen_archive.htm)]. Then using the images and texts gathered each group creates a collage poster. If necessary the collages may be finished for homework or in future class periods.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Prior to the end of class hand each student a copy of the following excerpt from “Aman the Story of a Somali Girl” or write the excerpt on the board for them to copy (“Aman the Story of a Somali Girl” Virginia Lee Barnes and Janice Boddy Toronto and New York: Vintage 1995]:“My mama and grandmama had been traveling for a couple of days walking miles and miles with their animals searching for water. Mama was nine months pregnant. When you live out in the bush with animals … you’ve got to find water and grass for them. Some people go where water has fallen – you have to follow the rain.”Ask students to write a short piece in a similar style that describes the experience of a child refugee from the country they investigated in class. In a future class display the collage posters and writings to create your “The Refugee Experience” exhibit. Invite other classes to view the exhibit.Further Questions for Discussion:–Who are the groups fighting in Chechnya? Who are the rebels and what do they want?–What is an oral history? How do oral histories differ from other historical accounts? What role does subjective experience play in an account of history?–Do you agree with Dr. Maria Tarakanova when she says “children whether they are Armenian Chechen or Russian are all the same”? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries participation in class discussions participation in group research thoughtful completion of group collages and thoughtfully written first-person depictions of the experiences of refugee children.Vocabulary:respite sanitariums liturgies refugee anthem conscripts chaperone demobilized muster offspring militia impoverished tolerant sentimentExtension Activities:1. Using historic periodicals Web sites and other resources explore in greater depth the country assigned to your group in class. Create an illustrated timeline of the conflict that sent the refugees in that country into exile. What groups were fighting each other? When did the conflict first arise? What subsequent conflicts arose through time? What events caused refugees to leave that country? How many refugees fled and where did they resettle?2. Using cardboard paper clay and other materials create a topographical map of Chechnya. What countries surround Chechnya? How have the topographical features of Chechnya influenced political boundaries in that region? How have these features influenced the war there?3. Research the organizations that help refugees. What type of aid is available for war refugees? What goods and services are needed by refugees? How can individuals who want to help refugees become involved? Organize a drive for clothing toys or other goods that will aid refugees from a country you studied in class.4. Find a pen-pal network and set up correspondence with a refugee student from the country you studied in class.Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics- Research refugee situations around the world at the site of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (//www.unhcr.ch/welcome.htm) and write an article titled “Who Is a Refugee?” Can soldiers be refugees? Can criminals? What rights do refugees have according to the United Nations?Fine Arts- Listen to the song “Imagine” by John Lennon. What was the artist trying to convey in this song? Does the information you gathered in class relate in any way to this song? Write your own song that conveys how people should live in the world. What lyrical images might convey what you learned about the refugees studied in class?Health- According to the article “many of the Chechen children bear the psychological or physical scars of war.” Research the health problems of refugees who resettle in a new country. What health effects do traumatizing experiences cause? What treatments are available? Find the programs in your community that help refugees to cope with these problems and write a guidebook of programs for helping refugees in your community. If possible visit the organizations sponsoring these programs and find out how you can help.Journalism- Interview someone who has experienced war first-hand and write an article describing what you learn. What war did this person experience? What was his or her “participation” in this war? Did he or she support the war? Why or why not? How did the experience change this person? Would the person be willing to participate in the same way again? Why or why not?Other Information on the Web:Crisis in North Caucasus (//www.cdi.org/issues/Europe/ncaucasus.html) offers analysis interviews maps and research from the Center for Defense Information.Chechnya: A Land in Conflict (//russianculture.about.com/culture/russianculture/library/weekly/aa092099.htm) provides background on the conflict and a look at inhabitants of the region from About.com.Human Rights Watch: Chechnya (//www.hrw.org/campaigns/russia/chechnya/) presents press releases and reports on the Russian incursion into Chechnya.Chechen Republic Online (//www.amina.com) contains news maps audiovisual content and more on the Republic.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8World History Standard 44- Understands the search for community stability and peace in an interdependent world.

 0,Carl T. Hayden the chancellor of the Board of Regents and Richard P. Mills the state education commissioner said that they would not consider postponing the policy because it was already proving a success. Mr. Mills said that easing the graduation requirements even temporarily would be ''absurd'' and ''unjust'' because it would send a signal that not every student should be held to high expectations.''It is a bogus argument to suggest that some students can't achieve at the levels we have set'' Mr. Mills said. ''And it is an absurd proposal to stop at the very moment when teachers school administrators and above all children are demonstrating success.''Mr. Hayden said he was surprised at the former regents' opposition to the new graduation policy because Ms. Gluck and Ms. Matteoni participated in the discussions leading up to its adoption and voted for the requirements in 1996.But the women said that when they voted to require all students to take the Regents exams they did not realize that test scores would be the only factor determining whether students got diplomas.''The thinking at that point was that everyone would take the exams but you could get a diploma through other channels'' Ms. Gluck said. ''There was never the sense that everyone would be expected to reach the exact same goals in the exact same way.''Under the old system students had two options: getting a local diploma by passing a set of basic competency tests or getting a more prestigious Regents diploma by passing the more difficult Regents exams. When the Board of Regents adopted the new policy in 1996 less than 40 percent of students statewide -- and less than 25 percent of New York City students -- were graduating with Regents diplomas.Ms. Gluck and Ms. Matteoni said that while they had supported phasing out the basic competency tests it was with the understanding that the Regents would come up with other ways of meeting graduation requirements. Students who aspire to become chefs or mechanics should not necessarily be held to the same standard as students who want to attend Ivy League colleges they said.
 9,One cannot count on strong players' sticking to strategies they have used before. In studying their games one must of course master the ones for which they are best known but the work cannot stop there.Nor can one adopt a defense just because the opponent has relied on a line of play that one feels safe in facing. Strong players are self-critical and those that convince themselves that their previous performances against a specific defense have left something to be desired will alter course without warning. So schooling oneself in one-tenth of a defense is not good enough; one must digest it all.Every once in a while even a very experienced player forgets that point.In the 10th round of the Hoogoven "B" Tournament from Jan. 9 to 25 in Wijk aan Zee the Netherlands David Bronstein of Russia who had played a tie match for the world championship in 1951 and should know all about such things readied one splinter of a defense to play against Patrick Wolff. When Wolff a 24-year-old grandmaster from Belmont Mass. changed his attack Bronstein revealed his omission by taking an hour and 20 minutes for his first 18 moves.And they weren't good ones either as Wolff forcefully showed.Against the Lasker-Pelikan variation of the Sicilian Defense with 5 . . . e5 Wolff had earlier in the tourney played 9 Nd5 Be7 10 Ne7 Ne7 11 Bd3 and had not achieved anything for Black to worry about. Bronstein was wrongly expecting a repetition of that but when Wolff switched to the main line 9 Bf6 gf (9 . . . Qf6?! 10 Nd5 Qd8 11 c4 is positionally potent for White because 11 . . . b4? 12 Qa4 Bd7 13 Nb5! ab 14 Qa8 Qa8 15 Nc7 Kd8 16 Na8 Nd4 17 Rc1 gains a rook for a knight) 10 Nd5 Bronstein had to struggle to recall it.
 9,For 56 years Eddie Robinson has been the football coach at Grambling State University in Louisiana and his 405 victories are the most of any college coach in history. Yesterday the National Collegiate Athletic Association placed Grambling on two years' probation for violations by Robinson his son Eddie Robinson Jr. and other coaches at the college.The N.C.A.A. cited infractions in football men's basketball and women's basketball. They included illegal recruiting out-of-season practices the use of academically ineligible players and a lack of institutional control.Among the football violations were impermissible tryouts and improper talks with prospective transfer athletes. In men's basketball a player was allowed to play in five games in 1993 even though he did not complete 24 credit hours the previous year as N.C.A.A. rules require. In women's basketball a player was allowed to practice and receive scholarship money during the 1993-94 and 1995-96 seasons even though her American College Testing scores had been invalidated.When the N.C.A.A. notified Grambling of the infractions the college started an investigation. In a 254-page response to the N.C.A.A. the college denied many of the charges. Still the N.C.A.A. called the violations ''major.'' Grambling assessed some penalties on itself. The major penalties came from the N.C.A.A.'s Committee on Infractions.

 9,Maggert had a chance to end the match at No. 18 but his 15-foot putt for birdie slid past the hole as the crowd moaned while Maggert stared at the ball and the cup in disbelief. But two holes later Maggert ended the match at No. 11 after hitting an 8-iron for his tee shot that landed near the green in the left rough.''I had the kind of chip where I could make it'' Maggert said. ''It was uphill had a little left-to-right break. The last thing I wanted to do was run it four or five feet by but I hit it a little bit too hard. Even when I saw it hit the hole I thought it was going to pop out. And it went in.''There were many shifts in momentum throughout the match which started with 18 holes in the morning followed by 18 more holes and then the two extra holes in the afternoon. Magee was 3 up through eight holes in the morning and he started the afternoon play still leading 2 up. But as he did throughout the tournament Maggert remained steady and confident despite struggling with putts from 5 to 10 feet and he slowly whittled away at his early deficit.''If it was a nine-hole tournament I might have won but I had 27 more to play'' Magee said. Asked if he thought about the prize money Magee laughed and said: ''I thought about the money all day. I knew what was at stake.''But Maggert walked away with the top prize moving to the top of the tour's money list this year. And the victory will elevate Maggert's recognition factor with the public. His peers have long recognized Maggert as a solid player but with six victories this week including the defeats of top-seeded Tiger Woods and Nick Price and Bernhard Langer Maggert rose to the occasion and won the first event of the new World Golf Championships series.Maggert came close to winning the United States Open in 1997 before faltering on the back nine and finishing fourth. Perhaps with this victory the 35-year-old Maggert will become even more confident during a tournament's crucial moments.''I knew inside that I had what it took to win tournaments'' Maggert said. ''Guys that can play well when they are nervous are guys that win tournaments. You can't be afraid of it. Everyone chokes in golf. That is just a fact of life. I have choked before. Sometimes I don't choke. But being nervous is part of the game. I was nervous but I was confident.''And today having refused to let another tournament slip away Maggert was a winner. ''It was a long week probably the biggest win of my career'' he said. ''You've got the top 64 guys playing and match play is a very difficult format. The biggest thing is I can just be myself now. If I finish second now it's O.K. Now I can go out and have fun.''

 0,The majority of the 51 seats of the New York City Council were filled with fresh faces two years ago thanks to a new term-limits law. This November the usual four-year term is shortened by half to allow for a post-census redistricting and all the seats are up for grabs again. But even abbreviated incumbency has its benefits. Only a few members of the Democrat-dominated Council face serious challenges in the Sept. 9 primary. These are The Times's endorsements for some of the most heavily contested races in Manhattan:Eighth District (East Harlem the Mott Haven section of the Bronx and part of the Upper West Side): The incumbent Philip Reed is facing a vigorous challenge from Melissa Mark-Viverito a member of Community Board 11 in Spanish Harlem and an activist who understands issues most important to its residents. She is Puerto Rican born an advantage in a district with a majority-Latino population.Mr. Reed is African-American but his Latino constituents have been among those benefiting from his Council tenure since 1998. While his most-noticed action this term was fathering the ban on cellphone use in theaters Mr. Reed has a much fuller résumé. On workers' rights women's rights tenant protections and services for the elderly his record is exemplary. In Spanish Harlem the epidemic of asthma among children is being addressed -- and is in decline -- due in part to the attention Mr. Reed won for the problem. While his Spanish admittedly is in a learning stage Mr. Reed is fluent in the language of an effective councilman. We endorse Mr. Reed for another term on the City Council.10th District (Washington Heights Inwood): Miguel Martinez the first-term incumbent is a likable low-key politician. But a district with desperate problems like a lack of affordable housing and severely overcrowded classrooms would benefit from an infusion of independent ideas and energy. Ydanis Rodriguez a teacher and grass-roots organizer who has worked with immigrant children and created a local college preparatory program has demonstrated a special kind of vitality in pressing for better services for the community. Recently when the subway stop at 191st Street was closed for repairs through the end of the year Mr. Rodriguez led a successful effort to get shuttle service for residents. We endorse Ydanis Rodriguez.

 9,"The idea here is that there is something akin to a thermostat that regulates body fat" said Dr. Jeffrey Friedman a molecular geneticist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Rockefeller University in New York and a discoverer of leptin. A set point like the temperature setting on a thermostat would be the body fat level that the brain maintains to keep leptin concentrations optimal.The idea of leptin as a signaler of body fat can help explain why some people are naturally fatter than others. For example some people may have fat cells that are genetically disposed to make meager amounts of leptin. Their bodies would need to create more fat cells in order to contribute the right amount of leptin to the bloodstream. Others may be genetically predisposed to respond weakly to the hormone perhaps because the receptor molecules on their brain cells where leptin exerts its signals only feebly bind the hormone. These people too would need more fat cells for the brain to feel it had received the right signal for its fat-thermostat setting.The notion of a leptin as a body fat regulator may also lead to an understanding of how body weight is inherited. Identical twins reared apart turn out to weigh almost exactly the same. Children who were adopted resemble their biological parents in terms of body weight rather than their adoptive ones. What may be inherited is an ability of fat cells to make leptin at a particular rate or an ability of the brain to respond to the hormone.The effects of leptin on metabolism and food intake may also explain the finding that body weight is maintained not just by the regulation of appetite but also by adjustments in metabolic rates. Mice that have too much leptin greatly increase their metabolic rates and decrease their food intake until they lose enough fat to bring their leptin levels into line. The hormone is thought to act on the hypothalamus the part of the brain that controls appetite and metabolism.People also adjust their metabolic rates and food intake when their body fat is greatly altered. The extreme example of what may turn out to be a severe leptin deficiency comes from studies of people who weigh at least double what they should who participated in research requiring them to live on a hospital ward for a year or more while their food intake was carefully controlled. Their weights plummeted to what was considered be ideal for their heights but their bodies became deranged. Their metabolisms were sluggish and they were always cold. They were obsessed with thoughts of food. The women stopped menstruating. Although they looked normal they behaved as though they were starving.

 0,This small city's fate has always been tied to the land. Now Delano is pinning its hopes on what lies beneath the land.Notable for grapes and once the home of César Chávez the founder of the United Farm Workers union Delano is in one of the richest agricultural areas in the United States. Yet the city has long struggled with high unemployment and deep poverty particularly among its large Hispanic and immigrant population.In recent years city officials have relied on a prison and a fruit packing and distribution center to keep the economy afloat. But this spring the city's sights have turned back to the land to a natural gas field that a local wildcatter speculates may be the second largest ever found in the West after the giant Rio Vista field also in California.Though state officials and other experts express skepticism about the gas field Delano officials sense opportunity in even the slim chance that the speculation will prove true. After all natural gas is gold these days in a state that needs the fuel for plants generating electricity.

 9,October sales among six of New York City's biggest retailers rose only moderately over the month a year ago the gains averaging 4.5 percent just about matching the inflation rate in department‐store merchandise.Warmer weather than in the 1976 month kept October's sales from rising more according to industry experts adversely affecting consumer interest in cold‐weather apparel particularly coats and other outerwear.Also the October business compared with a particularly strong 1976 month when sales were the strongest of the year. Sales in New York City had risen 8.6 percent in October 1976 in great part aided by extremely cold weather.City Gains Exceed RegionsAlthough last month's retail volume in the city was generally not strong the gain again topped the trend in the greater metropolitan area indicating that suburban stores were not doing as well as those in the city. Sales among stores in the area rose only 2.4 percent over last year a spot‐check found.

 9,About half the people with the disease never get rid of it; the liver is chronically infected and the hundreds of functions it performs from producing bile to making substances that help the blood clot are impaired. One in five people with this form of hepatitis develop cirrhosis a scarring that in severe cases can lead to liver failure. A smaller number get liver cancer. And many suffer unrelenting fatigue.Interferon's Side EffectsMost cases are caused by the recently identified hepatitis C virus but about 15 percent are caused by unknown viruses said Dr. Dienstag of Massachusetts General. He added that all patients with non-A non-B hepatitis responded equally well to interferon.Dr. Klein said interferon gave hepatitis patients their first hope. ''It was a terrible thing to say to a patient'' he added. '' 'I know what you have and I know what the probable outcome is but I have nothing to offer you.' Now you have something.''Until now patients have been advised to get plenty of rest; to avoid alcohol which can further damage the liver and to hope the infection goes away on its own.Last year two studies involving more than 200 patients demonstrated that interferon alpha was effective in suppressing the liver infection in nearly half the patients although nearly half of those suffered relapses and needed further treatment.Dr. Alter said patients had not been followed long enough to determine whether the treatment would prevent cirrhosis or cancer. But he said that by suppressing the virus ''it makes sense that you will get less scarring and less cirrhosis.''But interferon treatment has problems of its own researchers said. It can produce fatigue mild to moderate hair loss and lower counts of white blood cells and platelets leaving patients more vulnerable to infections and bleeding. Investigators are still trying to find the best dose and the best schedule to administer the drug.
 0,Updated 5:27 p.m. | The notion that New York’s Jewish electorate could be easily characterized has long been debatable. But the looming primary election on Tuesday is raising new speculation about how strongly Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama will appeal to Jewish Democrats.“I don’t speak for the Jewish community” said former Mayor Edward I. Koch “and nobody speaks for the Jewish community. The Jews individually speak for themselves.”And though these days he himself is speaking up for Senator Clinton Mr. Koch acknowledges that “lots of people — Jews and others — will be voting for Barack.”Indeed “it’s almost an embarrassment of riches for the Jewish voter” said Ammiel Hirsch senior rabbi of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. “Perhaps there is a certain amount of distress that they have to choose between the two because they are both enormously appealing to the Jewish community.”He added “It is a very exciting time for us because I think the Jewish primary vote in the New York area is up for grabs in the next five days.”To Sid Davidoff a senior partner at one of New York’s largest lobbying firms who is not working for either of the campaigns “I think there is going to be a split between established older voters in the Jewish community with whom Hillary will do well and younger and more liberal Jews who see Obama as an agent of change.”Although it would seem likely that Senator Clinton might capture the larger share of voters in her stronghold state including Jews even the slightest shift in Jewish support is a subject of interest. Some local blogs recently claimed that Councilman Simcha Felder of Brooklyn had switched his support to Senator Obama from Senator Clinton.A spokesman for the councilman Eric Kuo said Thursday that Mr. Felder has not campaigned for either candidate or previously announced support. Then during a radio program on Tuesday night according to Mr. Kuo Councilman Felder said that he would be voting for Senator Obama.An important reason for such intense scrutiny is that “the Jewish community tends to vote and make contributions far in excess of its proportion of the population” said Gary Rosenblatt editor and publisher of Jewish Week the nation’s largest Jewish weekly.Exit polls from the 2006 New York governor’s race showed 87 percent of the Jewish population voting Democratic and 12 percent voting Republican; in the 2004 exit polls about 8 percent of the New York vote was Jewish. A phenomenal 83 percent of voting-age Jewish adults were registered to vote — some 863000 people — in the five boroughs of New York City plus Nassau Suffolk and Westchester Counties according to a U.J.A. Federation of New York report in 2002 that was released in 2004.Not everyone is being swept away by the primary deadline of course.“Generally speaking I am suspicious of all politicians on the Jewish issue” said Marvin Kitman a media critic for The Huffington Post. “With friends like them we don’t need enemies. The basic question we of the Hebrew persuasion tend to ask on all issues whether it is the Giants in the Super Bowl or Amy Winehouse or global warming is: Is it good or bad for the Jews?”This week trying to make it clear that he is good for the Jews Senator Obama answered questions from reporters at Jewish news outlets in a conference call. His aim was to counter concerns about his positions on issues like his hope for a dialogue with Iran saying that the control of nuclear weapons by Iran would be a threat to Israeli and United States interests. He added that he had long spoken against anti-Semitism and had always denounced the views of Louis Farrakhan.In the Senate Senator Obama backed Israel during its 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon and in the Monday conference call he said that Palestinians must control terrorist activity and violent anti-Israel actions before Israel should make concessions.Both senators “are supportive of Israel and few question that” said Rabbi Steve Gutow executive director of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs a nonprofit group that promotes consensus among Jewish groups and oversees the Israel Advocacy Initiative which tries to communicate pro-Israel views.The American Jewish Committee and other Jewish groups have criticized a campaign of e-mails that made false claims that Senator Obama was among other things a secret Muslim. (He is a Christian who has attended Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago since the 1980s.)“I think Obama has dealt effectively with those rumors that he is really a secret agent” Mr. Rosenblatt said.And to Rabbi Hirsch “Most Jews are too sophisticated to fall for that garbage” he said adding “It’s almost embarrassing that there would be an attempt to sway us in that manner.”As for Senator Clinton “I don’t think the Suha issue has any resonance anymore” Mr. Koch said. In 1999 Mrs. Clinton attended an event in Ramallah where the wife of Yasir Arafat Suha accused Israel of poisoning Palestinian women and children with toxic gases. Mrs. Clinton listened with obvious discomfort but left politely giving Mrs. Arafat a kiss.Mrs. Arafat’s remarks were denounced by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and in New York Mrs. Clinton was criticized in newspaper editorials and by several groups for her silence and the kiss. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani then a possible Senate candidate sharply attacked her.Mr. Koch added: “I said that Suha wasn’t an issue in a Hillary commercial then. And I’d say it again in a commercial now if she asked me.”Both senators are still looking for endorsements and hoping that the ones they have will influence Tuesday’s vote. “Both Hillary and Obama have prominent people in the Jewish community supporting them” Mr. Rosenblatt said.Aside from Mr. Koch prominent Jewish politicians supporting Mrs. Clinton include New York’s other senator Charles E. Schumer; Senator Dianne Feinstein of California; and Representatives Gary L. Ackerman of Queens Eliot L. Engel of the Bronx Jerrold L. Nadler of Manhattan and Anthony D. Weiner of Queens and Brooklyn.Among Senator Obama’s supporters are several Jewish members of Congress: Representatives Steve Rothman of New Jersey Adam B. Schiff of California Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and Robert Wexler of Florida.Although the candidates have focused on public appearances in other states “my sense is that there is a huge amount of enthusiasm for both candidates in the Jewish community and that both represent an important breakthrough in American political and social life” Rabbi Hirsch said.He added: “The community was disproportionately active in favor of the civil-rights movement and so the prospect of an African-American president is enormously moving for the Jewish community. But then the prospect of a woman president is also very moving for the Jewish community.”In the American Jewish Committee’s national Annual Survey of American Jewish Opinion 70 percent of Jewish Democrats said they had a favorable opinion of Senator Clinton in comparison with 45 percent for Senator Obama. The telephone poll in November studied 1000 self-identifying Jewish respondents in a sample that had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.A victory in New York’s Jewish community for Senator Obama would be remarkable. “In the Chicago community Jewish voters know Obama well and like him” said Malcolm I. Hoenlein vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations an umbrella organization that focuses on Jewish issues. “But in New York Jewish voters don’t know him well.”None would predict who would sway Jewish voters on Tuesday. “I think that the Jewish vote is supporting Hillary at this point” Mr. Davidoff said. “But Obama has the buzz. And with the primary less than a week away this is very volatile.”Read more Primary Journal blog entries from the New York region.
 9,New York State's highest court today upheld an investigative panel's findings that Elizabeth Holtzman the former New York City Comptroller had violated the city's conflict-of-interest laws when she took a campaign loan from a bank trying to obtain city business.In a unanimous decision the Court of Appeals also said that Ms. Holtzman not only used her office for personal gain but also thwarted the bank's efforts to obtain repayment of the $450000 loan at a time when the bank was seeking a lucrative contract from the city.The decision marked the final chapter in a case that had sullied the name of Ms. Holtzman once one of the city's most prominent political figures who lost her race for the United States Senate in 1992 and lost the Comptroller's race a year later.Hours after the decision was announced Ms. Holtzman who now practices law privately assembled a news conference in Manhattan where she apologized for her behavior and expressed regret for the incident. Then as reporters looked on she held up a copy of the loan document grabbed a cigarette lighter and set the document on fire before dropping it in a wastebasket.

 0,PhotoSeason 6 Episode 13: “Dark Money”How awesome would it be to have Lemond Bishop and Kalinda Sharma as your parents? That thought arose near the end of “Dark Money” Sunday night’s episode of “The Good Wife” as the series returned from hiatus for a season-ending 10-week run.In the episode’s tertiary but most engaging plot Lemond called in the favor Kalinda owed him and it didn’t involve stealing evidence or killing a rival drug dealer. He needed her to pick up his son Dylan from school for two weeks and drive him home. Tight-lipped Lemond didn’t say why and Kalinda still nervously calling him sir didn’t ask. But there were obvious dangers: a black SUV following Kalinda and Dylan and a schoolmate bullying Dylan giving him a black eye.It was fun to see Kalinda as surrogate parent throwing the bully up against the school wall worrying about Dylan’s safety and his feelings but also worrying about what Lemond would do to the other boy if he found out. (In an odd glitch the question of the mysterious SUV which we saw several times was simply dropped — presumably to be picked up again in a future episode.) The scenes were sensitively written and benefited from the fact that Mike Colter (Lemond) and Archie Panjabi (Kalinda) have the best chemistry on the show right now at least in an episode where Chris Noth doesn’t appear. (And young Eric Ruffin is excellent as Dylan.)Eventually Kalinda had to make a stand — having effectively snitched on the bully and been dismissed by Lemond she turned around went back to his house and knocked on the door. He of course was in the middle of making a perfectly civil call to the other boy’s father asking him to have a talk with his son. Then he poured a drink for Kalinda and mused to her about being a father. It was a nice if predictable scene — the two damaged tough guys (that’s a gender-free usage) sharing a tender moment. It also paralleled another scene in which Alicia had to make her own decision about standing up for what’s right. More about that later.In the case of the week we had the pleasure of watching Dylan Baker play two roles: his recurring one as the amusingly despicable businessman and probable wife-murderer Colin Sweeney and another as a look-alike actor who had played a Sweeney-like role on a ripped-from-the-headlines television show “Call It Murder.” (That the actor was Australian was perhaps a little dig at current American casting practices.)Sweeney was suing the show for defamation and Diane and Cary were representing him. Having two named partners at the table didn’t satisfy Sweeney who wanted Alicia there too. (Mr. Baker and Julianna Margulies have good chemistry too though in a more comic theatrical manner.) Still busy with her campaign for state’s attorney she couldn’t appear in court but she agreed to help after he blackmailed her by threatening to expose who was funding her political action committee. (It’s Lemond right? I’m sorry but my attention strays whenever the election story line comes up.)After some less plausible than usual twists — including the defense’s abrupt 180-degree shift in strategy from trying to prove that the show wasn’t based on Sweeney’s life to admitting that it was and trying to prove that Sweeney did in fact kill his wife — Sweeney won a public apology with a crucial assist from Alicia. (She noticed that the logo of the Florrick Agos client ChumHum appeared repeatedly in the television episode and apparently this was potentially damaging enough to ChumHum to allow Diane and Cary to threaten a countersuit against the production company. Hmm.)Mr. Baker was as drolly enjoyable as ever and it was entertaining to see Sweeney’s vanity exposed and undercut as he listened to the barrage of testimony against him. Even better was Laura Benanti doing her purring-sex-kitten thing as Sweeney’s current wife who testified against him and had to be bought off. Of course they were nuzzling like newlyweds once the case was settled.One minor aspect of the Sweeney story was to illustrate the continuing can-she-have-it-all question surrounding Alicia’s political campaign — Sweeney blamed her for not being able to give him her time. Oddly there was no echo in the episode of the blistering confrontation among Alicia Diane and Cary at the end of the previous episode in January when Alicia accused them of sexism for not consulting her when they allowed David Lee back into the firm (thereby keeping ChumHum as a client) and they countered that she was distracted and unreachable. Everyone seemed to be getting along fine.The campaign story line was a self-contained episode with a fairly pat moral lesson. Both Alicia and her rival Frank Prady lobbied a crude homophobic sexually harassing Democratic mega-donor and noted supporter of Israel for some off-the-record campaign cash (the “dark money” of the title). The donor a Phoenix-based moneybags named Gus Redmayne was played by Ed Asner who appeared to be enjoying himself immensely. (No immediate real-life models come to mind though the major Republican donor and Israel supporter Sheldon Adelson is based in nearby Las Vegas.)Redmayne who couldn’t keep his hands off Alicia told her he’d give her the money ($1 million) not because she was attractive but because he didn’t like gays. He praised a gay-baiting telephone robo-call that had been paid for by her PAC and said “Kick that fruitcake when he’s down.” (Alicia tried to point out that Prady wasn’t gay but Redmayne wasn’t having it.) When he met with Prady he launched into a vividly phrased description of sex with Alicia.Prady called him disgusting and walked out. Alicia put on a pained smile and took the money. And on top of it she worried that she had once again helped Colin Sweeney win even though it’s almost certain that he killed his wife.The episode ended with a scene that was touching despite some clunky writing mainly because Makenzie Vega as Alicia’s daughter Grace has so fully taken over the role of the show’s moral center. Drinking red wine (the alternating symbol of joy and despair) Alicia sat morosely on the couch as Grace sensitive to her mother’s moods asked how she was doing. Soon a sobbing Alicia was saying “I don’t like when people do bad things” (ouch) and being comforted by her daughter.Alicia: “I was bad today.”Grace: “No Mom you weren’t. You can’t be.”Alicia: “Why? Why can’t I be?”Grace: “Because you’re the best person I know.Is she? The current danger as I see it isn’t that we lose our affection for Alicia because of her compromises but that we lose our interest in her because the campaign plot is so unswervingly dull. It also feels like the writers are trying to have it two ways — Alicia angry resolute and hard-changing at the end of one episode then Alicia sobbing conflicted and in need of comfort the next. Is that a realistic depiction of a character’s complexities or is it inconsistency? (In the previous episode Alicia said Diane would never question her about taking on the campaign if she were a man. Would the producers of “The Good Wife” portray their main character crying on a daughter’s shoulder if he were a man? Sure it’s a completely unfair question — the show’s about a woman and her fight to operate in these male-dominated worlds. But still.)Please tell me how wrong I am and offer any other observations questions and recriminations in the comments. Next week’s episode “Mind’s Eye” is probably an important one. It was written by Michelle and Robert King the show’s creators and directed by Mr. King.

 9,New York City has hired two private companies to collect overdue parking fines under guidelines established after the 1986 scandal involving the city's Parking Violations Bureau.The hiring of the two agencies Sharinn & Lipshie P.C. and Coldata Inc. was announced yesterday by City Transportation Commissioner Ross Sandler. He said they have been assigned to collect a total of $90 million in outstanding parking summonses.The parking bureau stopped using private agencies three years ago after disclosures that outside agencies were paying bribes to some of the bureau's top officials for collection contracts. Since then the bureau has used city workers to collect overdue parking fines.Both companies hired to help with the collections are Long Island concerns that used to do business with the city but neither has been used by the parking bureau for about 10 years the city's Transportation Department said. 'Very Stringent Guidelines'

 9,The New York Philharmonic has become the Shirley Verrett Show the last few weeks. Miss Verrett the American soprano sang her own set of concerts for subscription listeners last week and Friday afternoon she replaced another soprano Montserrat Caballe who has been ill and was unable to appear.Aside from accompanying Miss Verrett - which they did very well - Zubin Mehta and the Philharmonic limited themselves to two overtures the Brahms ''Tragic'' (Op.81) and the Szymanowski Concert Overture (Op.12). The Brahms was hard-driven and tensely played while the Szymanowski - given in celebration of the composer's centenary - was notable for its screaming brass great gusting fortissimos and its contrasting string sections which sighed and groaned in their late Romantic splendor. In short it was music supremely loud and enthusiastically vulgar. Both performances were beautifully coordinated and constituted orchestra playing of high virtuosity. Indeed this is music that Mr. Mehta performs perhaps better than any other conductor.Miss Verrett repeated the Chausson ''Poeme de l'Amour'' that she sang last week. She added two arias by Massenet - ''Pleurez pleurez mes yeux'' from ''Le Cid'' and ''Il est doux il est bon'' from ''Herodiade.''Miss Verrett - beautiful as ever and dramatically spotlighted on stage - seemed almost to overstate the case in Chausson's delicately evocative music; but in the two Massenet pieces she was absolutely splendid. The style was grand and the voice equally so. It was one of those instances where virtuoso singing technique and dramatic expression seemed to merge one into the other. The usually subdued Friday audience was loudly enthusiastic at the end.

 0,Edward Rivera the author of the autobiographical novel ''Family Installments: Memoirs of Growing Up Hispanic'' and an assistant professor at City College of New York died on Aug. 25 in Manhattan where he lived. He was 62.The cause was a heart attack said his brother Richard.When ''Family Installments'' was published in 1982 it drew attention as a groundbreaking book dealing with Latino life in Puerto Rico and New York City. In a review in The New York Times Book Review Philip Lopate said that the novel was ''noisily brimming with life'' and praised it for its ''graceful lyrical language.'' Richard Rivera said that his brother's book took 10 years to write and that it was ''a way of documenting the importance of our family in his life and the pain of culturation.''Although this was his only book he also wrote short stories and essays which were published in literary magazines and later anthologized. In a sardonic essay in The Massachusetts Review in 1996 he recalled the difficulty he had in finding a publisher for his novel because it did not fit preconceived notions of what he called ''Underclass Lit.''Mr. Rivera was born in Puerto Rico grew up in New York and earned degrees from City College and Columbia University. He taught in the English department at City College and at the college's Center for Worker Education since 1969. He was known as a mentor to younger writers including Abraham Rodriguez Jr. and Junot Diaz.
 9,Don King was selling yesterday selling the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification fight on March 13 selling Madison Square Garden as the ''temple in the mecca of boxing'' but mostly selling himself as a bejeweled Job set upon by evil forces who had kicked him around but didn't finish him off.This is King's post-Mike Tyson period so he must sell the Holyfield-Lewis fight with ferocity. He is not guaranteed a profit from the promotion so he must cajole pay-per-view purchases above reasonable expectations to cash in.''How are you going to sell two million buys? I predict for you two million buys'' he bellowed yesterday from a dais on the Garden's arena floor. ''You say: 'What is this crazy guy saying? Is he out of his mind?' ''Mind you no fight has ever rung up two million pay-per-view purchases -- the closest was 1.89 million for the second Holyfield-Tyson bout -- and Holyfield's pay-per-view appeal has faltered when he has not faced Tyson Riddick Bowe or George Foreman. Lewis's pay-per-view appeal is unproven at best.

 9,Bernadette Castro the Republican candidate for United States Senate said yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to persuade her during a private meeting at Gracie Mansion on Sunday night to "consider distancing" herself from her party's gubernatorial candidate George E. Pataki.Ms. Castro a long-time friend and financial contributor to the Mayor told reporters at an impromptu news conference on Fifth Avenue that she refused. "I'm a member of the Republican ticket" she said. "George Pataki is the head of the ticket. If I didn't think he would be a good governor I wouldn't have joined the ticket in the first place."Providing a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes wrangling inside the Republican Party Ms. Castro attributed the Mayor's decision to cross party lines and support Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a Democrat to his long-running tensions with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato who helped engineer Mr. Pataki's candidacy."Look we're all grownups in this" she said contending that the real dispute was not between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani. "It's between Alfonse and Rudy. That's what it's all about. Rudy doesn't want Alfonse controlling the Republican Party."

 9,One of the saddest spectacles of the Eighties was the Reagan and Bush Administrations' systematic assault on both the effectiveness and the principles of the Justice Department. A first step must be to restore the pride and vitality of the Civil Rights Division which had a strong bipartisan tradition as a beacon of orderly social change under Presidents Eisenhower Kennedy Johnson Nixon Ford and Carter.To accomplish this the Nineties must begin with a return to another bipartisan tradition that of having the Attorney General as chief arbiter of legal policy in the Government. Mr. Bush allowed his undistinguished Attorneys General to be shoved aside by C. Boyden Gray his strong-willed White House counsel whose outdated antipathy to civil rights contributed to historic levels of mistrust between the White House and minorities. It is time to release the pent-up energy of career employees ready to straighten up a department thrown into disarray under Presidents Reagan and Bush. HomelessnessThroughout the Eighties it was possible to look from the windows of the White House family quarters and see a tableau of urban despair: the homeless people in Lafayette Park. Once the stands erected for the inaugural parade are dismantled they will be back and the Clintons will be able to watch them if they have the stomach for it.Mr. Bush was a chief executive who could observe Lafayette Park and come up with nothing more forceful than "a thousand points of light." Will Mr. Clinton be a President who looks from the same windows and says to himself: "I am leader of the richest and most powerful nation on earth and I choose to use some of that wealth and power to relieve this suffering. I may not be able to fix this overnight. But I have the resources to make a start and I will"?If he fails to see what is going on in Lafayette Park will Hillary Clinton be the kind of First Lady who takes him to those windows and reminds him that Presidents can make a difference to the most vulnerable of us? If the answer to either of those questions is yes the Nineties will be a better decade in every American city. ValuesFor this to be a healthy decade for America's political culture we do need a return to traditional values -- as those values existed before the distorting effects of the 1988 and 1992 campaigns. These are the values of community and compassion that flowed from the New Deal and once animated the political life of both parties.Starting with the George Wallace campaigns in the Sixties the bottom feeders in the political strategy business learned that they could win votes by redefining values in a crabbed divisive and hateful way. Some of Mr. Bush's hired hands the late Lee Atwater and the rancorous Roger Ailes carried out this work with a cold-blooded genius that was impressive but never admirable. In the year just ended the final insult to language and political sense could be observed in the vacuous sallies of Vice President Dan Quayle and the venomous ones of Patrick Buchanan.

 0,To the Editor:Contrary to what William Saletan charges (''What's the Value of a Fetus?'' Op-Ed Oct. 26) abortion rights supporters do not treat the fetus ''as nothing.'' We do not recognize the fetus at all because there is no one fetus.There are many fetuses and they do not have equal value.The distinction is crucial because the value of fetuses depends on the varied circumstances of pregnancy.One fetus results from contraceptive failure and is aborted with a mixture of reluctance and relief. Another fetus despite being desired and planned is inexplicably miscarried causing unmitigated sorrow. Other fetuses live to be born. These were my fetuses.I will not face the grim decision about what to do when a pregnancy threatens my life. But some other woman will. With the banning of so-called partial birth abortion she will learn that the law now values her fetus over her own life.
 9,The personnel shake-up in the Soviet Communist Party yesterday was accompanied by a revamping of the party structure. Six Central Committee commissions were created all headed by secretaries of the Central Committee to supplant 22 departments as the party's main administrative apparatus. Political power continues to be centered in the Central Committee and the Politburo where all important decisions are made. Communist Party CongressTheoretically the highest body the congress consists of delegates elected by party organizations around the country. It ordinarily convenes at least once every five years with its next meeting scheduled in 1991. The Congress elects the Central Committee which is to meet at least every six months. Central CommitteeConsisting of about 300 voting and 150 nonvoting members it is picked from among party congress delegates. It acts for the congress between sessions meeting about twice a year to discuss and approve policies. It formally elects what is in effect the highest party body the Politburo. PolitburoIt sets the overall policy of the country and now has 12 full (voting) members and 8 candidate (nonvoting) members all of whom are among the nation's leading political figures. All members have regular duties elsewhere in the party or Government. Secretariat

 9,Back in 1981 President Reagan's first budget bravely proposed ending the $4 billion in annual farm subsidies that David Stockman the Budget Director reviled as ''organized larceny.'' Five years later those subsidies are up to $30 billion and the Administration is still stumbling from plan to plan in an effort to appease wrathful farmers.The latest initiative timed for the Tuesday elections would pay farmers to idle one-fifth of America's grain land. It might actually save the Treasury some money next year. But it's still a sorry substitute for the free-market design that has been buried by public sympathy for poor farmers and hard-nosed lobbying by the rich ones.The Agriculture Department offers about $2 for every bushel of grain that qualified farmers agree not to plant next spring. That would set back the taxpayers about $2 billion. But in the loony-tunes world of farm subsidies this could prove a bargain. If the grain were planted and grown the Government would be legally obliged to buy and store it at considerably higher cost. Farmers apparently like the new subsidy program too. Cash today for not planting next spring sure beats having to raise crops and risk losing them to weather or insects. And reducing total stocks of grain improves the prospects for future prices.Economists may even rationalize new subsidies for not growing grain that partly offset existing subsidies encouraging production. The result could be output closer to private supply and demand. Lost in the political shuffle though is all pretense of a long-term strategy for returning American agriculture to the free market.

 0,Yet it did. On Oct. 2 came the denouement. There was a protest meeting that afternoon in the Plaza of Tlatelolco. The army had been given orders to dissolve the meeting but their assault ended in a cross-fire between soldiers and the mysterious “Olympic Battalion” a paramilitary group created by the government posted in nearby buildings.It was the unarmed students who paid with their lives. The hellish violence went on for hours. No one knows the exact number of dead. There was talk of hundreds. Perhaps there were even less than 100 slain but the scenes of horror the arrests and imprisonments the revelations of torture would linger in our collective memory down to the present day.Over the years various theories about the massacre have been proposed. The C.I.A. seemed to believe in a conspiracy forged in Cuba a theory that was brandished by Mr. Díaz Ordaz. However for better or for worse such an idea was highly unlikely since Mexico was the only Latin-American country that had refused to break off relations with Castro. In his unpublished memoirs Mr. Díaz Ordaz asserts that Mexico was “at war.” The students were “the opponents.” After the killings he would write in a tone of satisfaction “They finally obtained their insignificant deaths (sus muertitos).”The real war unleashed in 1968 Mexico was the struggle for the presidential succession in 1970. As had been the custom since 1929 a Mexican president would designate his successor. Various government secretaries would wage a no-holds-barred struggle to gain presidential favor. Luis Echeverría secretary of the interior would finally be the winner because in the eyes of Mr. Díaz Ordaz he showed “more pants” and was “the boldest.” And he also effectively nourished the president’s paranoia.Perhaps the greatest contribution of ’68 was in behalf of freedom of expression. Although as president Mr. Echeverría Mr. Díaz Ordaz’s successor tried to ingratiate himself with university students through a rhetorical veering to the left the criticism he kept receiving from the newspaper Excélsior (very much in the spirit of ’68) exasperated him enough that he maneuvered a coup (in July of ’76) against its editor Julio Scherer.

 0,Romano Prodi now president of the European Commission was prime minister when Italy was struggling to win acceptance into the euro club. He remembers how Italian interest rates were two and three times the German rates. He remembers how top German officials initially treated Italy's ambitions as almost laughable.But Italy did make it into the club. It cut its deficit stabilized its exchange rate and brought down its inflation to German levels. As investors became more confident in Italy interest rates on Italian bonds dropped to some of the lowest levels in history. That reduced Italy's huge interest rate payments and helped bring down the deficit even more.''For me as an Italian the euro is pure joy'' Mr. Prodi said in an interview.It is easy to forget and even many Europeans do that the euro has existed since Jan. 1 1999. That was when Germany France Belgium Luxembourg Spain Italy Portugal Ireland Austria Finland and the Netherlands officially locked their national currencies together and created the euro as a new combined currency. Greece joined the group two years later. Britain Denmark and Sweden have stayed out.To be sure the euro has been a disappointment to those who expected it to challenge the dominance of the dollar. In the three years leading up to the introduction of euro notes and coins the euro has not eroded the dollar's position as an international reserve currency. It has not brought Europe's economic growth up to that of the United States.And even now when the American economy is in recession the euro has not become a safe haven for international investors. The dollar still accounts for 68 percent of the reserve currencies held by governments around the world while the euro accounts for only 13 percent.The shaky confidence of investors about Europe is etched clearly on the value of the euro: still down about one-fifth against the dollar since 1999 the euro is worth about 90 cents.Another example of the euro's impact is in changing the ground rules for doing business including the way companies raise money.

 9,''Narcissistic vulnerabilities'' as psychoanalysts refer to them make people particularly sensitive to how other people regard them. ''You see it in marriage in friendships at work'' Dr. Ornstein said. ''If your boss fails to smile when you greet him it may create a withdrawn anxious feeling. If so your self-esteem has been hurt. A sturdy self absorbs that; it has a bank account of self-esteem so it's not unbalanced. But if you're vulnerable then these seemingly small slights are like a large trauma.''On the surface extreme narcissists are often brash and self-assured surrounded by an aura of success. Indeed they are often successful in their careers and relationships. But beneath that success feelings of inadequacy create the constant need to keep inflating their sense of themselves. If they do not get the praise they need they can lapse into depression and rage. The Workaholic's RewardAdmiration rather than the pure pleasure of doing things well is what propels narcissists to their success psychoanalysts say. Thus many workaholics put in their long hours out of the narcissist's need to to be applauded. And of course the same need makes many narcissists gravitate to careers such as acting modeling or politics where the applause is explicit.Many difficulties in intimate relations are due to narcissism according to David A. Berkowitz a psychiatrist at Tufts University.''Narcissism makes someone vulnerable to the least failure to be loved or accepted just as they are by their partner'' Dr. Berkowitz said. ''Marriage brings to the fore all one's childhood yearnings for unconditional acceptance. A successful marriage includes the freedom to regress to enjoy a childlike dependency. But in marriage a couple also tend to re-enact early relationships with parents who failed to give them enough love. This is particularly hard on those with the emotional vulnerabilities of the narcissist.''Narcissists tend to surround themselves with people will will laud them rather than give criticism when it is needed. They are drawn too to the trappings of success such as automobiles or houses that announce their worth to the world. Narcissists find in them support their grandiose sense of themselves.Narcissists are typically charming and friendly. Their own intense need for adulation makes them sensitive to the same needs in others and so they are particularly adept at ingratiating themselves. But there is a hidden agenda to their friendliness: they are interested only to the extent that their own self-importance is fed by it.

 9,''But for many children the reality of childhood is altogether different'' it said. [Excerpts page A12.] The halls of the General Assembly reverberated during the day with lofty and often poignant language about the plight of children not only in the most destitute countries of the world but also in urban communities in richer lands. $20 Billion Needed Despite the high level of concern expressed none of the leaders attending the summit pledged fresh money to meet the cost of achieving the goals that experts said were likely to require an extra $20 billion a year for the rest of the decade.''A better world for children is within our reach but as many heads of state have pointed out today it is too early to say whether it is within our grasp'' Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada a co-chairman and a catalyst for convoking the conference told the closing session. ''The real work starts now.''The world leaders including President Bush were limited to four minutes each to allow everyone a chance to speak today. [Excerpts from leaders' addresses page A13.] Mr. Bush who had to give priority to the negotiations on reducing the budget deficit flew back to Washington after speaking in the morning and then returned late in the afternoon to resume meetings with other leaders who were in New York. He is to address the General Assembly Monday morning on world issues.The traffic gridlock that some city officials said they feared never developed although there were some slowdowns as limousines approached and left the United Nations area.The summit meeting transformed the United Nations today. In keeping with the theme children were everywhere. The choir of the United Nations School provided the arriving leaders with folk songs. Children in national costumes posed for pictures with the celebrities and a large number of children were in the audience for the opening ceremonies.
 9,To some mixed emotions the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History opens an exhibit today celebrating the United States Constitution. Six years ago it decided to commemorate the signing of the Constitution with a $1 million study and exhibition that documents the experience of 120000 United States citizens and residents of Japanese dissent who were interned in isolation camps in World War II and of the 30000 Japanese-Americans who fought with United States forces in the war. The exhibit is meant to be a reminder of the ''imperfection of our efforts to produce perfect fairness'' said the museum's director Roger Kennedy.Although a 1980 Congressional commission labeled the internment program a breech of constitutional rights and a result of wartime hysteria and racial prejudice Mr. Kennedy encountered no small opposition to his project.Three times a request for appropriated funds for the exhibit was turned down by the Office of Managment and Budget. But the most overt disapproval has come from the public in the form of several hundred hostile letters.''For some people who were very deeply scarred by the Second World War it is hard to distinguish between our fellow citizens of Japanese ancestry and those who inflicted the scars 45 years ago'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 0,The following report compiles all significant security incidents confirmed by New York Times reporters throughout Afghanistan from the past seven days. It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials refuse to confirm casualty information. The report includes government claims of insurgent casualty figures but in most cases these cannot be independently verified by The Times. Similarly the reports do not include Taliban claims for their attacks on the government unless they can be verified. Both sides routinely inflate casualty totals for their opponents.At least 51 pro-government forces and eight civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the past week. The casualties of pro-government forces and civilians decreased this week possibly because of the cold weather in most parts of the country. The Taliban attacks were most concentrated in Kandahar Province where insurgents carried out four attacks killing 15 members of security forces and one prosecutor. Six police officers were killed in two insider attacks in Kandahar and Kunduz provinces. The bloodiest attack took place in Zabul Province where 12 police officers were killed in Taliban attacks on their outposts.Ashraf Ghani Afghanistan's president speaking last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland said 45000 members of the security forces had died since he took office in September 2014 — a much higher total than anyone in his government had previously acknowledged. Additionally a new report released by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction said that the Afghan government’s control of its country declined late last year in terms of both territory and population.[Read the Afghan War Casualty Report from previous weeks.]Jan. 30 Farah Province: two children killedTwo children were killed when a mine exploded in Purchaman District. Local officials said they were investigating the incident.

 9,One day last week a visitor to the Metropolitan Museum found herself smiling back at a man who was gazing impishly even flirtatiously at her. He had curly hair big eyes and was wearing what appeared to be a turtleneck sweater. His last name was Lesueur. His first she does not know nor ever will. He died in 1876.Lesueur an actor was one of the many famous friends and acquaintances photographed mostly in the mid-19th century by a caricaturist and journalist who called himself Nadar and is now the subject of a major museum show. Nadar a tall burly man with hair that flies back from his face and a thick mustache looks in his self-portrait like a handful. His wife her eyes and lips narrowed and her body backing away from his camera certainly seems to have thought so.In truth Nadar may or may not have thrown off heat and his wife may or may not have frosted the air around her. Such speculation is based only on a long luxurious scrutiny of their images -- luxurious because one cannot afford to stare too long at actuality. Actuality -- living breathing people -- gets angry ("Why are you looking at me that way?") or defensive ("I didn't sleep last night") or snippy ("So rude!"). Images remain serene.Some photographs say more about their makers than they do of their subjects. And a photograph in a fashion magazine however attractive the model is meant to talk about what she or he is wearing. But the subject of a photograph by the Nadars of this world speaks to the viewer. Sometimes the viewer like the woman who smiled at Lesueur speaks back.

 9,New proof of the links between mental problems and overall health has been mustered in a large study of 29915 Federal employees and their families who filed claims for mental-health treatment with Aetnafrom 1980 to 1983. The average of their claims for health problems of all kinds - not just psychological problems - was $158.82 a month more than 70 percent higher than health insurance claims of 16468 other Federal employee families with the same coverage but no mental problems. On an encouraging note after mental-health treatment the group's use of both mental and general health care declined to $137 a month according to James O. Blose an analyst with the Human Ecology Institute in Chapel Hill N.C.Despite the downward trend however the average claim for people with psychological problems remained higher after three years of mental-health treatment than the average - $108 a month - three years before treatment was started.Mr. Blose and Harold D. Holder director of the Prevention Research Center in Berkeley Calif. published these findings in the October issue of Hospital and Community Psychiatry.Dr. Kessler of American Psychmanagement said large employers had recently been paying more attention to their mental-health costs which often are rising 25 percent. Not soon enough however said Kenneth S. Abramowitz a health-care analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. ''Very few employers intelligently manage their mental-health benefits'' he said. ''Corporate America has got to rethink its whole atttitude toward mental-health benefits and I don't see them doing that until they get totally taken to the cleaners.'' Jeff Goldsmith head of Health Futures a Chicago management consultant firm is equally vehement. ''One of the hottest areas for cost containment over the next two or three years will be in-patient psychiatric services because of widespread abuse'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''So much of what they are doing could be moved to an out-patient basis.''One method for minimizing hospitalization is a process known as case management. Service companies like Dr. Kessler's keep track of each mental-health claim. The case managers who usually are psychiatric social workers or nurse clinical specialists advise physicians about alternatives to hospitalization which may cost $4000 per patient.

 0,Walking in New York this season I stumble into a time warp. The smell of fir from sidewalk Christmas tree vendors plunges me into memories: sparkling red and silver lights on childhood holiday boughs the judder of a saw in my hand as I built spruce bookshelves and the songs of wrens and hermit thrushes along a forested trail in Canada. This portal into the past is opened by odor alone by the fir needles perfuming whole city blocks.No other sense is as direct as smell. No other sense is as ancient. Smell bypasses the neural processing centers that mediate all other senses. The aroma of fir trees flies me directly into specific wordless memories: childhood holidays hand-sawn woodwork and my feet tramping through wet forests. When I breathe in signals run along nerves wired straight to the parts of my brain governing emotional memory and associative learning. My conscious brain catches up later adding a patina of language.This inward journey into human remembrance is mirrored by an outward connection to the lives of trees and forests. The chemical conversation between cells and air- and waterborne aromatic molecules unites all living beings from animal noses to plant root tips to the cell surfaces of bacteria. The scents of holiday trees evoke primal experience.Other trees and their products join fir’s resinous spice in the seasonal bouquet. Roasting chestnuts loose sweet earthy scents on street corners. Hanukkah olive oil perfumes the kitchen — sharp and green from early-season harvests rounded gold from later pressings. The spiced wine of pomegranate mingles with the tannic nose-bite of olives and tree nuts on Persian Yalda tables marking the winter solstice. In the Southwest piñon pine wood smoke is the winter incense of the desert mountains.

 9,To the Editor: Betsy Wade's article "In Trip Insurance Small Print Is No Small Matter" (Oct. 11) brought to light problems faced by the traveler as well as by the travel agent. Among the cases Ms. Wade cited was the problem faced by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Kammerer long-time clients of my agency Travel Headquarters of Short Hills N.J. When Mr. Kammerer fell ill he could not get compensation for the cost of the cruise the couple was not able to take on Pearl Cruises because the trip-cancellation coverage ceased when they began their trip.The article did not report that Pearl Cruises' insurance policy arrived less than 10 days before the Kammerers' departure. This was past the deadline for purchase of a Chubb policy called Travelsafe that our agency always recommends to tour and cruise clients if the operator's policy is not broad enough. Travelsafe covers for trip cancellation interruption and delay and remains in force for the duration of the trip. ELIZABETH L. KOCH Short Hills N.J.
 9,Japanese officials moved closer today to stating that the Government would agree to a slight opening of Japan's rice market if that was necessary to conclude a new global trade treaty.The Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato said at a news conference today that Japan might eventually make a "political decision" to make a concession so as not to jeopardize the current round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.The statement was one of the strongest indications to date that the Government was ready to reverse its official stance of trying to maintain a ban on imported rice.Meanwhile Asahi Shimbun a major Japanese newspaper reported this morning that the Government had already essentially decided to remove the prohibition on rice imports. The newspaper said the Government had found it impossible to persuade other nations to allow Japan to maintain its closed market which Japan has argued is necessary to assure self-sufficiency in its staple food.

 9,Twenty-two Civil War and Lincoln scholars and historians released a statement yesterday saying the charges of plagiarism against Prof. Stephen B. Oates "are totally unfounded."The charges were brought at a symposium of the Illinois State Historical Society last fall by Prof. Robert Bray of Illinois Wesleyan University.

Professor Oates of the University of Massachussetts at Amherst denied the charges.In a statement released yesterday the 22 scholars and historians said "We find no evidence of the appropriation of either the ideas or the language of other scholars without attribution -- the only legitimate test of plagiarism."Signers of yesterday's statement included C. Vann Woodward of Yale University David Donald of Harvard University James M. McPherson of Princeton University John Hope Franklin of Duke University Eric Foner of Columbia University and William S.

 9,WASHINGTON Sept. 2—The Labor Department reported today that the unemployment rate rose two‐tenths of a percentage point in August to 7.1 percent of the work force and said that the increase reflected almost exclusively higher unemployment among black workers.Civil rights leaders immediately asserted that the new figures confirmed charges by black leaders earlier this week that the Carter Administration had neglected blacks the poor and the cities.President Carter apparently spurred by the August unemployment results and by the criticism of the black leaders today asked Charles L. Schultze chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall to prepare a report on the reasons for the rising unemployment among blacks and on steps for attacking the problem.Jody Powell the White House press secretary said that the President had asked that the report be ready for a meeting he has scheduled with the Congressional Black Caucus next week.

 0,President Obama will push General Motors into bankruptcy protection on Monday making a risky bet that by temporarily nationalizing the onetime icon of American capitalism he can save at least a diminished automaker that is competitive.The bankruptcy to be filed in New York is a moment of reckoning for an industry that was once at the heart of the American economy The New York Times’s David E. Sanger Jeff Zeleny and Bill Vlasic write. It culminates a remarkable four months of confrontation between Washington and Detroit that is expected to result in a drastic downsizing of the company.It also places the government in uncharted territory as a business owner as it takes a 60 percent ownership stake in the company during its restructuring.Reflecting the government’s extraordinary intervention in industry aides say Mr. Obama plans to tell the nation on Monday that he believes G.M. can be brought back from the brink of insolvency even if the company looks almost nothing like the titan of old.Meanwhile a federal judge late Sunday night cleared a path for Chrysler to get out of bankruptcy by approving a sale of most of that carmaker’s assets to a new entity to be run by Fiat of Italy.Administration officials briefed reporters on the G.M. plans Sunday night as President Obama began to inform members of Congress. But the White House insisted that the aides who talked to reporters could not be named.In his remarks on Monday Mr. Obama will spell out a strategy in which a shrunken G.M. can make money even if new car sales remain at a sluggish 10 million a year in the United States and even if G.M. once the giant of the industry drops below its current 20 percent market share in this country.But to get there American taxpayers will invest an additional $30 billion in the company atop $20 billion already spent just to keep it solvent as the company bled cash as quickly as Washington could inject it. Whether that investment will ever be recovered is still an open question.The company will also have to shed 21000 union workers and close 12 to 20 factories steps that most analysts thought could never be pushed through by a Democratic president allied with organized labor.Forty percent of the company’s 6000 dealers will close the workers’ union will be forced to finance half of its $20 billion health care fund with stock of uncertain value in the restructured G.M. and bondholders including many retirees will be forced to take stock worth 10 cents for every dollar they lent the company.The company’s last steps toward bankruptcy took place over the weekend as a majority of G.M. bondholders agreed not to challenge the filing in court and to exchange their debt for stock.Lawrence H. Summers who as head of the National Economic Council serves as one of the co-heads of the auto task force argued in an interview with The Times on Sunday that the bailout of the auto industry was fundamentally different from the Mexican bailout in 1994 the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s and the continuing banking crisis.General Motors and Chrysler he said were “clear cases of insolvency” in which mere loans would not accomplish the goal of getting the automakers past a temporary crisis. “There was no argument that they were solvent no argument they could meet their obligations.”He told The Times that left the Obama administration to decide whether to allow “a laissez-faire uncontrolled bankruptcy which would have had an enormous cost” or a “controlled process” in which the goal was to make sure that the auto companies not only restructured but were not overburdened with debt. So in return for what amounted to debtor-in-possession financing Mr. Obama chose to accept equity in the new company — while insisting that he had no intention of exercising day-to-day control over the company.“It’s a fine line” Mr. Summers told The Times “but we think it is manageable.”To assist in the restructuring the automaker is expected to hire the consulting firm Alix Partners which has worked on several major bankruptcies including those for Enron and Kmart. One of the firm’s partners Al Koch is expected to manage the liquidation of corporate assets that G.M. will shed during its Chapter 11 restructuring people with knowledge of the strategy said.Mr. Obama is taking several risks under the plan. None may be bigger than the decision that the United States government will take its 60 percent share of the stock in a new G.M. leaving taxpayers vulnerable if the overhaul is not successful. (Canada for its part is taking a 12 percent stake.)“We don’t think that after this next $30 billion they will need more money” one administration official said. “But the fact is there are things you don’t know — like when the car market will come back and how much Toyota and Honda and Volkswagen will benefit from the chaos.”On Monday Mr. Obama is expected to argue that any alternative to his plan would be worse and that a liquidation of G.M. — the only other real option — would send the unemployment rate soaring over 10 percent and would radiate damage throughout the economy.But aware of the hardships the plan will impose on regions across the country that depend on auto production the White House is dispatching a dozen Cabinet members and other officials across four states this week to reassure residents.Aides say Mr. Obama will portray himself on Monday as a reluctant shareholder eager to sell the company back to private investors perhaps within 6 to 18 months.Officials say the president will insist that once the government sets up new management and a board of directors it will remove itself from G.M.’s day-to-day operations. But even his aides anticipate intense pressure as the company’s managers are called to testify in Congress and face questions like why they decided to build new cars in Mexico and South Korea rather than in Michigan or the South.“Congress and many Americans are going to say if we own it why can’t we make these decisions?” one of Mr. Obama’s top economic aides said “and it’s going to be a challenge to answer that.”To ease the way the White House on Sunday briefed reporters on a new set of principles for how the government should behave as a majority shareholder. It argued that the government’s role should be limited primarily to the beginning of the process but that it should then recede becoming a passive investor one seeking to sell its stake quickly.At the same time Mr. Obama has laid out goals for all the Detroit automakers that will presumably affect their major strategic decisions. He has urged them for example to build smaller cars with significantly better fuel efficiency.Six months ago even the suggestion of such deep intervention into G.M.’s operations would have raised huge objections. But by the time the denouement came the company seemed almost relieved. Robert Lutz G.M.’s vice chairman said that “for the first time in our history the American auto industry has the ear of the administration. Their number one goal is to make us successful.”Nonetheless Michael Useem a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania told The Times that the decision would “mean a new chapter in the history books on American capitalism.” He added “How we think about American free enterprise is really hanging in the balance.”For Mr. Obama whose ascent to the White House depended on carrying states across the industrial Midwest the political risk is significant.The G.M. bankruptcy will ripple across several states where hundreds of parts suppliers and car dealerships face imminent closings.Indeed the four states where Cabinet secretaries are focusing their efforts this week — Indiana Michigan Ohio Wisconsin — all were carried by Mr. Obama last November. It was the first time Indiana has supported a Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years.These Main Street political challenges will almost certainly be an issue for Democrats on the ballot in next year’s midterm election campaign and in the president’s own re-election effort in 2012. If those jobs shift to nonunion plants in the South where German and Japanese carmakers have built their facilities or overseas Mr. Obama could face criticism inside his own party.“It is unacceptable to ask U.S. workers to subsidize the exportation of their own jobs” said Representative Dennis Kucinich Democrat of Ohio whose district includes Cleveland. “The taxpayers’ investment should be used to protect American plants so that American workers can build the next generation of automobiles.”In his presidential campaign speeches last year often delivered in the shadow of closed manufacturing plants Mr. Obama bluntly conceded that most of the jobs would not come back. Instead his administration is pointing to investments that the economic recovery act will make in communities.Rob McNabney chairman of the Madison County Democratic Party in Anderson Ind. a onetime booming automotive center said the problems for Mr. Obama were severe. “He’s going to be judged by what he does” Mr. McNabney told The Times.Go to Article from The New York Times »Go to Related Press Release from General Motors »Go to related Item from DealBook »
 9,Among other scenes he did not choose to recall aloud were those of Haitian refugees adrift at sea as their rulers spent months mocking American threats and the violence that broke out in the streets of Port-au-Prince last fall even as American soldiers looked on.Instead Mr. Clinton sought to make indelible a vision of a United States putting its power to good service. From the steps of the gleaming National Palace and from the side of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who had sent Mr. Clinton and his predecessor into fits of exasperation over what they saw as his uncooperativeness in exile the President declared that the American-led mission "has been accomplished and with remarkable success.""Today we come together as friends" Mr. Clinton told the citizens of a country whose plight has for so long confounded American leaders.Even last September as he sent American soldiers back to Haiti for the first time since F.D.R. Mr. Clinton always described their objectives as limited. In a Haiti that is still desperately poor and much less than stable -- despite an operation that has cost $900 million since United States soldiers landed on Sept. 17 he was careful to repeat those cautious words today.But with Republicans in Congress outspoken in their criticism of peacekeeping missions and with public opinion polls showing tepid support for American involvement here the President also transformed his appearance into a kind of emblem.He recalled the doubts that were raised last summer as his showdown with Haiti's military leaders reached its crucial point and he made clear that he had no doubt that he had chosen the proper course."Seven months ago the world wondered whether the United States could summon the will to protect democracy in this hemisphere" Mr. Clinton told the soldiers this morning. "Now the world knows once again that the United States will honor its commitment and stand up for freedom."

 9,Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has stumped the state and urged residents in radio ads to elect a State Legislature on Tuesday that would be packed to the rafters with third-party candidates from Mr. Weicker's own independent Connecticut Party.But there's a significant caveat: Most of the candidates that his party has endorsed and that will appear on its ballot line which reads "A Connecticut Party" are not members of the party at all. Many say that if they win they won't owe the Governor anything.So the question is what's going on here?Is Mr. Weicker really building a permanent third party in Connecticut? Is he just endorsing candidates who may or may not need his help? Or is he really doing no more than building support for himself? Politics as Usual He SaysMr. Weicker for his part has said he is only keeping promises. Mostly he has endorsed candidates who supported him last year in his efforts to impose an income tax.

 9,The campaign for Governor of New Jersey now in its last five weeks finally has produced some heat and in the process seems to have awakened the state's volatile electorate to the elements of high drama present in this contest:Governor Byrne a 721000‐vote winner four years ago who lost most of his luster early in his administration had to beat nine rivals to get the Democratic nomination last June. Now he is trying to overtake his Republican opponent State Senator Raymond H. Bateman who has a 7‐point lead according to the polls.There is a strong emotional issue the state income tax championed by Mr. Byrne and denounced by Mr. Bateman.Interest in the outcome extends to the White House since New Jersey and Virginia are the only states in the nation with governorship races this year and the results could be interpreted as the first referendum on the Carter Administration. President Carter recently campaigned in the state with Mr. Byrne and said he would be back before the election Nov. 8.Not only the tempo but the nature of the campaign has changed. The Governor the target for so long of harsh criticism over the income tax went on the attack two weeks ago when Mr. Bateman offered a program that he says would enable him to run the state for the next four years without the tax. Mr. Byrne ridiculed the plan and its author reminding audiences that Mr. Bateman had voted for an income tax in the past and generally succeeded in putting his opponent on the defensive. Political observers could only wonder however how all this was affecting the state's inscrutable so‐far passive electorate.

 9,HE has been called the Infomercial King and the Head Honcho of Hair Replacement. But although thenickname may vary millions of television viewers hear Sy Sperling of Manhasset declare every night that he is "not only the Hair Club president" but "also a client."His delivery is just bland enough to convince viewers that he is no actor. His before-and-after demonstration in which he holds a photograph of his bald head next to a youthful face now framed by thick brown hair is impressive for the 30 million American men plagued by varying degrees of alopecia or hair loss.Mr. Sperling's success is part of a trend for entrepreneurs to take to the airwaves to sell their products. Now Mr. Sperling who is 52 has turned his advertisement into a 30-minute "infomercial" or paid advertisement. The advertisements and "advertorials" for the Hair Club for Men are seen 400 times a day on network and cable television at a cost of $12 million this year. But Mr. Sperling added that is a small price to pay for a campaign that puts a former swimming-pool salesman from the Bronx at the helm of a $60 million company.His fame he said is a "nice but incidental" result of an advertising campaign that a Manhattan ad agency whose name he refuses to disclose began 11 years ago. "Because of these ads" Mr. Sperling said "there are a couple of hundred million people who know who I am at this point and who know about my company."

 0,In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges the clearinghouses for the two markets introduced a plan today that would cut settlement costs by 90 percent for certain trades.Brokers have expressed concern about the potential for escalating costs should the London and Frankfurt exchanges combine to form a pan-European bourse called iX. Winning the support of brokers is crucial for the London Stock Exchange in its attempts to ward off a hostile bid from OM Gruppen A.B. the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm stock exchange.''It's a good workable blueprint'' said Brian Mairs a spokesman for the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.While today's proposal went a long way toward addressing shareholder concerns questions about how the savings would be achieved and who would benefit the most underscore the difficulty that European stock exchanges were facing as they tried folding dissimilar technologies and regulations into one entity. A certain amount of overlap in terms of how trades are settled has led some shareholders of the London Stock Exchange to call the proposal a political Band-Aid rather than the most economically viable solution.

 0,WASHINGTON — Republicans with justification shouted “hypocrisy” last week after former White House aides opened a campaign organization using the sort of anonymous donors condemned by President Obama.But they also understood it as a compliment. That’s because in another springtime full of political disappointment Democratic strategists have begun concluding that Mr. Obama faces a tougher-than-anticipated re-election fight.Just as signs of economic recovery last year faded with the Greek financial crisis and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico the drop in unemployment and a rise in stock values to start off 2011 have been offset by higher gas prices and turmoil in Washington and abroad. Even as a flawed boisterous group of Republican presidential challengers struggles for traction Mr. Obama’s own poll standing has drifted down — to 46 percent in the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll.“The significant challenges that President Obama will face are being masked by the weakness of the Republican field right now” said Geoff Garin a Democratic pollster.Mr. Garin is advising Priorities USA the new political group Republicans criticized. He believes that Democratic activists and donors chuckling lately over the antics ofDonald J. Trump and other Republicans need a wakeup call.(Doug Mills/ The New York Times)“It’s not just Obama needs to run hard” Mr. Garin said. “Democrats have to take this seriously.”The Shadow of 2008Americans have voted for change in each of the last three national elections. And though the economy has recovered somewhat from the financial crisis Mr. Obama inherited it has done so slowly and unevenly.The unemployment rate has fallen from its double-digit peak but remains high at 8.8 percent; the economy grew in the first quarter of this year but only at a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The most recent New York Times/CBS News poll showed Americans more downbeat about the country’s direction than they have been since the early weeks of Mr. Obama’s administration.“In a way Obama’s biggest obstacle to overcome in 2012 is Obama 2008” said Rachel Gorlin a Democratic consultant. Voters “just get this overall impression of things being out of control that change hasn’t happened. It’s going to be one of the toughest runs for an incumbent president and his party in a long time.”The national economy is Mr. Obama’s biggest problem but not his only one. Voters link increases in gas prices to the upheaval in the Middle East as Libya follows Iraq and Afghanistan on the list of American military commitments.The political brinkmanship that threatened a government shutdown before Mr. Obama and Republican lawmakers compromised on spending cuts underscored the sense of disorder in government. So has warfare in state capitals over budget problems mirroring Washington’s.Voters “lump it all into: everything’s a mess and people in politics can’t govern” said Bill Carrick a Democratic strategist in California. On Mr. Obama “they’re still trying to figure out what kind of leader he is.“Is he effective? They haven’t made up their minds on that.”Rallying the BaseCongressional reapportionment after the 2010 census has already taken six electoral votes from states Mr. Obama carried. But the breadth of his 2008 victory gives Democrats some encouragement.Even if the president cannot repeat his breakthroughs in Florida Indiana North Carolina Ohio and Virginia he could win a 273-vote electoral majority by holding all of the other states he carried.The White House counts on Republican overreaching to help do that despite the struggling economy. By highlighting partisan differences on immigration Democratic strategists see the possibility of expanding Mr. Obama’s 67 percent showing among Hispanics which helped deliver Colorado Nevada and New Mexico in 2008.The House Republicans’ plan to transform Medicare provides an opening to regain ground among senior citizens who helped erase the Democrats’ House majority last November. Challenges to organized labor by Republican state leaders like Gov.Scott Walker of Wisconsin have alarmed a crucial element of the Democratic base.And yet Democrats still see Wisconsin which Republicans have lost in six straight presidential elections as a battleground.After carrying the state by 13 percentage points in 2008 “Obama should be doing enormously better there” Ms. Gorlin said. “It being in play means he can’t take anything for granted.”Ms. Gorlin worked on a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election in which Democrats counted on a backlash against Mr. Walker to propel a powerful turnout. But Republicans’ turnout was also impressive; their candidate leads in the recount.That experience foreshadows the burden facing Democrats across the industrial Midwest and elsewhere in reviving some semblance of the 2008 enthusiasm they capitalized on among young voters African-Americans and suburban women.“This election is still going to be defined by how events unfold over the next year and a half more than by anything we know for sure today” Mr. Garin said. “The idea that it’s over before it starts in these circumstances is crazy.”

 9,Canadian lumber industry executives today condemned an agreement that will set aside a 15 percent United States tariff penalty on Canadian softwood exports to the United States and replace it with a 15 percent Canadian export tax.The executives were joined by politicians opposed to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government which reached the agreement in Washington late Tuesday under the pressure of a midnight deadline set under United States trade law.The agreement will apply to Canadian exports that captured 32 percent of the United States softwood market in 1985 at a value of about $2.9 billion.Industry analysts here forecast that the new export tax will reverse a trend that has seen Canada widening its American market share in recent years as layoffs and bankruptcies have increased in the United States softwood industry. American companies contending that low fees in Canada for timber cutting amounted to an unfair subsidy led the fight for a tariff penalty that resulted in a Commerce Department ruling that imposed the 15 percent import levy.

 9,To the Editor:Have we become so politically correct that we have lost our sense of humor and found a new issue for possible lawsuits? I can't see firing someone -- in whom you have invested time money and training -- over an E-mail.As I gather from the example someone in a workplace found a message offensive but no one was touched groped or whispered to. It would be more cost-effective for a company to suspend someone over this rather than cut off the nose to spite the face.LARRY KIRKPATRICKBuffalo Wyo. July 18
 9,A BATTLE over trade between the United States and Western Europe was averted last week but the specter of a war was not banished. In a burst of telephone negotiations with Washington European Community officials agreed to compensate American farmers for lost markets arising from import duties imposed when Spain joined the Common Market last year.Aiming without saying so at France an adamant defender of the Community's protectionist agricultural system the Reagan Administration had threatened to slap prohibitive 200 percent duties on cheeses brandy white wines and other luxury items unless the United States was compensated for $400 million in lost sorghum and corn sales. Amid muttering by the French and others about highhanded American tactics Community negotiators also agreed to lower tariffs on a score of industrial products as part of the compromise package.The 11th-hour deal prevented a tit-for-tat cycle of protectionist measures that could have quickly spread beyond the relatively minor $400 million issue at hand. Both sides appreciated the larger stakes which in ultimate terms had to do with world prosperity and the solidity of the Atlantic alliance. And to an extent both indulged in dramatic posturing and threats aimed at reassuring home constituencies that they were driving hard bargains. In the United States and France this meant well-organized and highly disgruntled farm lobbies.Last year saw a spate of such trade disputes and 1987 will probably see more. The Americans and Europeans went to the mat last year over steel citrus fruits and pasta. And looming are fights over the European airbus which the United States contends is unfairly subsidized and American access to the West European telecommunications market.
 0,''If it was the 99th year or the 101st year it would still be the most important thing of the year for me'' he said. ''The centennial doesn't change the importance for the team or for me as an athlete.''Armstrong seems to be facing a far broader array of opponents than usual. They include Jan Ullrich 29 a German who twice finished second to Armstrong; Joseba Beloki 29 a Spaniard once second twice third; Santiago Botero 30 a Colombian who was fourth last year and won the first long time trial with Armstrong second; Levi Leipheimer 29 an American who was eighth last year; and Christophe Moreau 32 a Frenchman who was nowhere last year after a series of crashes forced him to retire from the race.Armstrong has dominated them all before and they may be intimidated by him. Intimidated riders tend to shoot for an attainable second or third place not first.Somewhat in the same state is Tyler Hamilton 32 an American who helped Armstrong win three Tours as part of the Postal Service team. Hamilton joined the CSC team from Denmark last year finished second in the Giro d'Italia despite a broken shoulder and then 15th in the Tour while still injured.A strong climber and time-trialer Hamilton nevertheless may not be able to overcome his respect for Armstrong to become a true rival.These are all men in or close to their 30's like Armstrong who turns 32 in September. What of the younger riders? At the top of the class are two Spaniards Iban Mayo 25 and Francisco Mancebo 27 each coming off a strong spring. A tad older is Aitor Gonzalez 28 another Spaniard and winner of the last Vuelta a España.Armstrong cited not one rider but a team Telekom from Germany as a threat.''Savoldelli Botero Vinokourov Nardello'' he said. ''Put 'em all together and they can be tough. I don't think any one of them is a potential winner but if you gave them a 15-minute breakaway then they are potential winners.''
 0,''To me it is the greatest miracle in life'' said Hambo Lama Ayusheyev the spiritual leader since 1995. ''It turns out there are things on which time has no power.''The 12th Hambo Lama was born in 1852 in Czarist Russia and orphaned early according to the Buddhists' history. At 16 he studied to become a lama and served in several monasteries in Buryatia. In 1911 he was nominated along with nine other candidates to become the Hambo Lama and he was ultimately appointed by the czar's governor in Irkutsk.During his time as Hambo Lama Itigilov is said to have strengthened the faith especially among the Buryats a nomadic people of Mongol descent who have lived in the region for more than 30 centuries. He published religious tracts and teachings and united many of the religion's factions.Most of Russia's Buddhists -- estimated today at one million -- adhere to the ''yellow hat'' sect that is predominant in Tibet. The Dalai Lama is their highest spiritual leader.In the years since the Soviet collapse Buryatia has remained a republic of the Russian Federation. Across Russia the Buddhists have begun to thrive again rebuilding lost temples opening schools and attracting new followers even among ethnic Russians.The Ivolginsk monastery is Russia's Lhasa attracting hundreds of believers a day to its temples and monuments. Hambo Lama Ayusheyev said he had not yet decided what to do with Itigilov's body but others say it will become a relic that will attract still more visitors.In Moscow Vladislav L. Kozeltsev an expert at the Center for Biomedical Technologies the institute that keeps the body of Lenin -- who died in 1924 -- in state on Red Square said the salt in the coffin might have slowed the decay but could not alone explain the preservation of the lama's body.

 0,“I’d like to check you for ticks.”I was taking three days to drive from Florida to upstate New York last week when I heard that line coming out of the radio on the second day. On the first day I had done the respectable thing and searched the dial for NPR and classical music; but they were nowhere to be found after I left Savannah behind and I was free to go where I always wanted to go anyway – to a country music station. You’re not going to come across a line like “I’d like to check you for ticks” anywhere else and the same goes for an earlier line in the same Brad Paisley song “You press that bottle to your lips and I wish I was your beer.”At first I had an academic thought: this is Petrarchanism updated a modern day turn on the convention – perfected by Francis Petrarch and passed on to John Donne and many others – of putting yourself in the place of an inanimate object that enjoys an envied proximity to your beloved. But I shook off the pseudo-intellectualism (at least for the moment) and surrendered to a pleasure that gets along quite nicely without the support of hallowed antecedents.What is the pleasure? First of all there is the sheer delight – self-indulgent but earned – in the cleverness of the lyrics: “If I said you have a beautiful body will you hold it against me? (It’s hard to imagine a neater instance of a purposefully ambiguous pronoun.) Where I’d like to be is “sitting next to you sitting next to me.” (The repetitions and alliterations mime the closeness the singer desires.) “I turn your picture to the wall when I’m lying next to her.” (Lying and lying.)The lyrics arresting as they are do not stand alone. Usually they anchor a story – the motto of one station I had on was “A story in every song” – and that story typically unfolds in a three act drama marked at the end of each act by a refrain that changes meaning with every repetition. A recent example is Emerson Drive’s “Moments.”In Act 1 the speaker tells us that at the end of a long walk he was about to cross a bridge when an old homeless man asks him for change. He complies – he wouldn’t need it anyway he remarks in an aside – and clearly ashamed the recipient of his charity declares “I haven’t always been this way/ I’ve had my moments” — some of which he then recalls in a longish verse.In Act 2 it becomes clear (although it is never explicitly stated) that our narrator wasn’t going to cross the bridge; he intended to jump. But the homeless man recognizing “that look in my eyes” just “kept hanging around”; and it is now the singer’s turn to be ashamed and to say “You know I haven’t always felt this way / I’ve had my moments.”In Act 3 the singer who has obviously lived to tell his tale imagines the old man sitting “‘round a trash can fire” and once again rehearsing his moments … to which has now been added the moment “When a young man almost ended it / I was right there wasn’t scared a bit / And I helped him to pull through / … I’ve had my moments.”Not startlingly original and a bit O. Henryish but nicely satisfying. After all where else can you get wordplay narrative structure pathos morality and a small dose of social consciousness in three minutes or less?You also get an entire culture or rather two. There is the culture of the country music industry itself complete with a capital city (Nashville) a famous venue (the Grand Ole Opry) a roster of legends several dynasties celebrity marriages nasty divorces innumerable rags to riches stories ostentatious displays of wealth – clothes cars jewels mansions theme parks. Then there is the culture country music describes and from which its stars all claim to have emerged – hardscrabble hard-drinking hard-playing and hard-praying.The emphasis is on family values and also on the many ways family values are eroded – by neglect cheating crime poverty illness death. The dominant tone is an unapologetic celebration of country – life virtues (honesty loyalty friendship piety) in the company of a nostalgia for the days now vanished when those virtues really flourished: She’s gone “gone like a ’59 Cadillac like all the good things that ain’t never coming back.” (You could say if you were of a mind that country music is a version of pastoral a genre that foregrounds a landscape that is understood no longer to exist.)But if you enter if only vicariously into the country music culture you have to swallow along with your enjoyment some stances and attitudes that might give you pause (or might not depending on who you are).It’s a man’s world even though a large number of the stars and superstars are women. In this world it is men who have the responsibilities and therefore the opportunities to default on them and then write a song about it. In those songs women especially wives and mothers are venerated but it is the kind of veneration reserved for forms of behavior – patience forbearance steadfastness chastity – the singer can’t quite get the hang of. Songs sung from the perspective of a woman are often angry; they are about betrayal and the hard road every woman will inevitably travel: “Sometimes it’s hard to be a woman” (Tammy Wynette); “Here’s to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters” (Danielle Peck).It’s a Christian world (and for “Christian” read “low Church Protestant”) where invocations of Jesus come as naturally as waking up in the morning. Think of it as Christian radio with all the sin left in. The religion is fierce and deep and its consolations acknowledge the pain and trouble to which they are a not always adequate response: “God is great but sometimes life ain’t good.”It’s a white world. Not racist; there is no minority bashing; there are just no minorities. (Yes I know about Charlie Pride and Cowboy Troy. Point made.)It’s a patriotic world given to flag-waving militarism and distrustful of foreigners and their ways of life.It’s a world without ethnicity (except for the southern trailer-trash kind) and everyone’s name sounds like two or three bitten-off anglo-saxon syllables: George Strait Clint Black Travis Tritt Johnny Cash Randy Travis Vince Gill Trent Tomlinson. Many of the names could be reversed and they’d still work fine: Travis Randy Tritt Travis Paisley Brad Gill Vince Tomlinson Trent.It’s a “classist” world with the favored class being lower middle and the disfavored class being any with pretensions. “They raised her up a lady / But there’s one thing they couldn’t avoid / Ladies love country boys” (Trace Adkins or is it Adkins Trace?).And it is a world that knows everything I have just said about it revels in it and puts it all into the songs. Never has a popular music scene been so self-referential. The singers caress the history they spring from rehearsing the litany of the great singers – Hank Dolly Patsy Waylon Loretta Willie Tammy – whose ranks they hope to join. (Another link to the pastoral; a pastoral poet always begins by invoking a long list of predecessors.)Of course I wasn’t thinking about any of this while I was driving. I was listening to the music and accepting its pleasures one of which was hearing Vince Gill and Dolly Parton sing Parton’s gloriously sentimental “I Will Always Love You” just as I crossed the Mason-Dixon line.
 9,With the Patriots coming off a 6-10 season in 1995 Parcells wanted to negotiate his way out of the final year of his contract with New England. Kraft using the foresight of Nostradamus negotiated away the final year but kept his hammer in place. Parcells was rejuvenated during the season and wanted to continue coaching but not in New England for Kraft.Parcells didn't want to deal in hypotheticals at his news conference in Foxboro Stadium yesterday but while he's not looking let's toss one out.Let's say Parcells does indeed land with the Jets and they make a huge leap next season and finish 8-8. Then the following season for whatever reason they slip to 6-10. What happens if he looks at the horizon and all he can see is another 6-10 in a very competitive A.F.C. East division?Remember Parcells is going to have to deal with the Super Bowl contender that he built in New England. He'll see Curtis Martin Drew Bledsoe Terry Glenn and Ben Coates (all scorned players) twice a year. Do you think Jimmy Johnson is down in Miami sitting on his boat twiddling his thumbs? And just two years ago Indianapolis was in the A.F.C. championship game.With the Jets being the N.F.L.'s version of ''This Old House'' it will take months maybe years for Parcells to strip away those old layers of losing that have built up like so much varnish.On the flip side the No. 1 pick -- whether it's offensive lineman Orlando Pace or quarterback Peyton Manning -- might be a monumental bust. However Pace might be the next Anthony Munoz.Yes Kraft has a big hammer over the Jets. But if he wants the No. 1 pick let him keep his hammer keep his ex-coach out of football for a year and get nothing. If nothing changes over the weekend the Jets should hire Green Bay's offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis as quickly as possible and let him decide which franchise player he wants to take with the No. 1 pick.

 0,Gateway Inc. in San Diego the computer maker said yesterday that it would take its account in-house a move that had been expected. Billings were estimated at $250 million.The shift came after the breakdown of talks to assign the account to the Minneapolis and New York offices of Fallon Worldwide part of the Publicis Groupe. Fallon was to replace McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising -- part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- which parted ways with Gateway in February after three years.The Gateway in-house team will work with Henry Corra a documentary filmmaker and his company Corra Films in New York; on several occasions Gateway bypassed its agency of record to work with Mr. Corra on television commercials.

 9,EARLIER this summer Carolyn Hack got the thrill of her life. Carolyn a 15-year-old high-school student fromOverland Park Mo. was in line to ride the roller coaster at an amusement park in Kansas City Mo. when she and her friends saw the actor Leonardo DiCaprio emerge from one of the cars. After the requisite hysteria Carolyn's response fit a modern teen-age template: she rode in the same car the actor had sat in; then she went home and wrote a detailed account of the experience for her Web site.If every home will eventually have a home page it seems that every fan will have the power to put up a fan site. And while it is common for celebrities to mount ''official'' sites it is the renegade pages that generate lively unadulterated discussions about the objects of their affection.''The best fan sites allow people to share something they experience and enjoy'' said Brian Bikowicz whose on-line name is Megazone and who operates a page about the pop singer Ani DiFranco. ''They let people who enjoy the same thing establish a collective memory of fandom.''Besides her own Web site Carolyn manages an on-line service called DiCapring (www.sky.net/hack/ dicapring.htm) which links almost 660 DiCaprio-centric sites. The Web ring creates an on-line community of fan-oriented sites pages that have little in common except that they satisfy the insatiable need to know everything about the celebrity or artist in question. Visitors to the sites can post rumors exchange pictures argue the quality of Mr. DiCaprio's work and generally wallow in the minutiae of the star's life.

 0,Bookstores new and used abound -- including one of Northern California's great independent bookstores and a local cultural landmark Book Shop Santa Cruz. Such literary demand hints at another less obvious Santa Cruz identity -- as a true university town. The population of about 55000 includes some 11000 students who attend the University of California Santa Cruz known as the most offbeat of the U.C. branches (their mascot is the banana slug).One afternoon we stationed ourselves at the Chocolate Bistro a sidewalk cafe near the entrance to Book Shop Santa Cruz and took in the parade of hippies yuppies punks students street musicians Hare Krishnas and police officers in shorts riding their mountain bikes. There always seemed to be at least one person playing the drums. (Now though there is a proposed city ordinance that if passed will make panhandling all but impossible after mid-October.)The scene was lively too for Sunday brunch at Zachary's deservedly the most popular breakfast spot for dishes like sourdough pancakes. Our first night we lucked out with a last-minute dinner reservation at Oswald -- a snug bistro recommended by every local resident we asked. The food was heavenly -- from a silky squid-ink risotto topped with Monterey Bay calamari to a dark chocolate soufflé served with a tiny pitcher of heavy cream -- but the ambience was casual right down to our blond surfer waiter.Surfers and their culture are ubiquitous. One of their landmarks is O'Neill's the Pacific Avenue shop owned by Jack O'Neill a 40-year resident who invented the surfing wet suit (no doubt inspired by the chilly Northern California waters). Outside old VW vans with surfboards strapped to the roofs ride Pacific Avenue straight down to the beach.One of the world's great surfing breaks Steamer Lane is off the sandstone cliffs of Lighthouse Point about a mile and a half up the coast from the Boardwalk. Unlike many such breaks it's easily seen from the coast as is Seal Rock a tiny island strewn with glossy black sea lions and harbor seals.The Point's little brick lighthouse has been converted into the Surfing Museum a snug space crammed with displays detailing surfing moves like aerials and floaters and the exploits of the two Hawaiian princes who introduced surfing to Santa Cruz in 1885. An enormous 10-foot redwood longboard from the 1930's vies for attention with a modern polyurethane board riddled with shark bites.But we soon joined the crowd that had gathered transfixed around a television set playing the 2001 surfing documentary ''Whipped!'' It includes stunning footage of a season at Mavericks the legendary big wave break point 60 miles up the coast and a mile from land. Surfers there ride -- and risk getting crushed by -- waves as high as 80 feet.
 0,Mark CornelisonSeth Davis a writer for Sports Illustrated and college basketball analyst for CBS is the author of “When March Went Mad: The Game That Transformed Basketball.” It’s a look at the 1979 N.C.A.A. title game that featured Magic Johnson’s Michigan State team against Larry Bird’s Indiana State squad. In an e-mail interview Davis discussed both players the impact the game had on the sport and whether we will ever see anything like it again.Magic vs. Bird is one of the most famous individual rivalries in sports history. When you started this book were you worried that almost too much was known about them?Not really because I knew I was reporting on a time in their lives that was not well-known to the public. There was certainly much about them that I didn’t know before embarking on this project. For example I had no idea just how close Larry Bird came to never playing college basketball. If Bill Hodges who had just gotten hired as an assistant at Indiana State in the spring of 1975 hadn’t managed to gently coax Bird off a garbage truck and convince him to give college one more try we would have never heard of Larry Bird. Likewise I learned a lot about Magic’s childhood specifically the fact that when he was a teenager he was bused to a mostly-white school with no basketball tradition. And of course the story of that season had many fascinating twists and turns that I never knew about. Most of the people who watched the 1979 championship game were seeing these guys play for the first time so the details about what brought them to that historic first meeting are not well-known even to most of their biggest fans.You weren’t able to talk to Johnson or Bird. Are there questions that you would have liked to ask Johnson or Bird that you didn’t get a chance to?I would like to have had the chance to try to get them to go beyond the sugar-coated anodyne versions of what went on back then that they usually try to tell. It’s not that I would have trolled for controversy but as a reporter you’re always trying to get closer to the truth. But those guys have been such open books – literally so since they both wrote autobiographies and have had numerous books written about them not to mention the hundreds of interviews they have given – that it’s unlikely they would have told me something fundamentally new. If anything not talking to them liberated me so I could view them with a more of a reporter’s critical eye. Maybe if I had spent a lot of time of them I would have subconsciously tried to please them as I wrote.The championship game itself was a little underwhelming. Bird had one of his worst games of the season and Michigan State was in control from the outset. Still the audience for it was enormous. What was it about this game that drew so many people to it? Was it simply the personalities of the two stars? Would it be remembered so fondly if Magic and Bird didn’t become Magic and Bird?It was to coin a phrase a perfect storm. First and foremost people really understood that these guys were unique and uniquely talented players. They were big men and they were making it cool to pass. Then you had the whole David-versus-Goliath thing. Indiana State was this little-known school from the Missouri Valley Conference with the mysterious farm boy and yet somehow they made it all the way to the final game undefeated. Were they really that good? In a one-and-done scenario that was extremely alluring. The fact that Bird was white and Magic was black added to the sexiness of the matchup but the biggest reason there was such a huge audience was simply because there weren’t that many viewing options back then. Instead of 800 channels there were only 4. As for them becoming Magic and Bird that obviously would not have affected the 24.1 Nielsen rating they generated that night but because of what they went on to accomplish this is one of the rare instances when an event that was huge at the time it happened has only grown in significance as recedes further in the rearview mirror.Can you talk a little bit about the news media coverage of the two players? While both received more than their share of praise (including each being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated) they were also the focus of heavy criticism at times. For example David Israel of The Chicago Tribune excoriated Bird for not talking to the press and Bill Gleason of The Chicago Sun-Times called Johnson “a mediocre passer and ball handler.”Well it’s all relative of course. The media coverage back then was only a fraction of what it would be today. But it’s amazing to think that Larry Bird who in many ways was the biggest story in college basketball that season went basically the entire year without talking to the press. Can you imagine a high-profile athlete pulling that off today – or even wanting to?They both had their share of skeptics as to how well their skills would translate into the N.B.A. especially since they weren’t naturally gifted athletes. The main difference is that while Bird couldn’t stand dealing with the media Magic absolutely relished in it yet he did it in a way that somehow never alienated his teammates. With them he was just a down-to-earth guy who treated everybody well. It speaks volumes about his personality and character that he was able to be a larger than life media icon (especially in Lansing) yet his teammates loved him. Maybe it has something to do with the number of easy buckets he got them!Phil Martelli can take some solace in the fact that Billy Packer was not too impressed the first time he came across Bird and Indiana State. What sort of insight did Packer give you into the season especially as someone who sort of became a lighting rod for Sycamores fans?Yes the more things change the more they stay the same! One thing people don’t realize about Billy Packer is that not only is he willing to admit when he’s wrong he actually enjoys being proven wrong. I will say that Billy never did quite get out of his mind-set that the only high-quality basketball is being played in major conferences. But a lot of people doubted whether Indiana State was for real that season. I really really enjoyed talking to Billy about everything that happened just like I always enjoy talking to him about college basketball history. He has a great memory terrific insights and he always tells you what he thinks no matter the consequences.This book deals with more than just Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird of course. Indiana State Coach Bill Hodges emerges as one of the more interesting characters not least because of what happened with his coaching career after that title game. How much did you know about Hodges when you started and what’s your perspective on him now?How much did I know? I didn’t even know the guy’s name. Seriously even if you asked the most ardent college basketball fans the question of who was Bird’s coach in that game I’ll bet almost none of them could tell you. And yet as you said he turned out to be probably the most interesting character in the book. Bill has really been through a lot both good and bad. A lot of people in his situation would have emerged with bitterness and regret but Bill has a great perspective on all that has happened. He is currently a high school history teacher in Roanoke Va. and he genuinely enjoys his job his life and spending time with his grandchildren.I can understand why he was able to convince Larry to get off that garbage truck. I would have played for the guy too if he asked me.A similar question about Jud Heathcote who went on to have a successful career at Michigan State after Johnson left. He seems like quite the character.For literary grist it’s hard to imagine a better subject than Jud. He is smart blunt and absolutely hilarious. It was interesting for me to go back to that time and learn more about what he was like and what his players thought about him. Today we think of Heathcote as this hilarious old codger but the reality is his players really did not like him. They did however respect his basketball knowledge. They had a lot to sort through as a unit to make it to that title game. He had to give a little which wasn’t easy for him but at that stage in his life there was only so much he was going to change. He had a pretty bad health scare last summer but it seems like he has come through O.K. and he’s as ornery as ever. God bless that man.The outcome of this game clearly still gnaws at Bird. Without giving too much away the closing scene shows him as still broken up about the outcome. Were you surprised by how much the game has stayed with both players especially Bird?That’s something that didn’t surprise me because we all know what intense competitors those guys were. The reason it gnaws so much at Bird is because he knows it’s something he can never get back. When Magic won an N.B.A. title or an M.V.P. award Larry could always say “I’ll get mine next year.” But this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and only one of them could prevail.And even though they’re great friends now they’re still competitors and Magic will always have the last word. I also think Larry’s regret stems largely from his affection for the community of Terre Haute. He knew how much this game meant to them and he still feels like he let them down.In this day and age with wall-to-wall sports coverage on television and on the Internet could we ever have a situation like this again?Absolutely not. That’s what makes it such a great story to revisit. We still get great games and great individual matchups but you have to remember this game was literally the first time most people had seen these guys play.Take for example what Bryant Gumbel said the night of the game when he hosted the pregame segment for NBC: “If you haven’t seen Larry Bird play you’re in for a treat.” Think about it – in my current role for CBS would it have ever occurred to me to say before last year’s championship game “If you haven’t seen Derrick Rose play you’re in for a treat”? There was an innocence back then a delayed gratification that paid off eventually in spades. I love watching wall-to-wall basketball as much as anyone but in a way it’s a shame that that element of the unknown is gone now. A little mystery goes a long way.

 9,Rather than lock themselves into a five-year $9.4 million deal for a player who would very likely never be more than their backup power forward and who insisted that he didn't want to play for them the New Jersey Nets yesterday refused to match the contract offer the Detroit Pistons made to Terry Mills.Willis Reed the Nets' senior vice president said that relinquishing the rights to Mills was a "basketball decision" but it was one that left him with no suitable reserve for Derrick Coleman the team's best player. Coleman missed 17 games last season mostly as a result of ankle sprains.Acknowledging that a hole now existed in what was a young improving eight-man rotation Reed said "We're going to have to go out and get another player."He added though that re-signing the team's remaining restricted free agent starting small forward Chris Morris was his first priority. At the same time the Nets have Mills's $875000 slot from last season within the salary cap with which to replace him.

 9,WASHINGTON May 1—The United States and China have begun unpublicized negotiations in Washington to settle financial claims between the two countries—a necessary step toward the establishment of normal trade relations.Administration officials disclosed today that the talks had been conducted over the last several weeks by William H. Gleysteen Jr. the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs and Han Hsu the deputy chief of the Chinese Liaison Office here.However despite the declared willingness of both sides to discuss the highly complex problem involving some $80 million in blocked Chinese assets and American claims of $200 million officials said that no breakthrough was near and that it might take a long time to reach an agreement.These are the Carter Administration's first important negotiations with the Chinese to become public and they are in keeping with the President's declared wish to normalize relations.

 0,Mr. Spitzer who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2006 said the $850 million was the largest settlement with one company since he began investigating corporate wrongdoing three years ago. He has negotiated billions of dollars in penalties and restitution from banks and mutual funds for cheating customers. The largest single payment until now had been $300 million paid by Citigroup whose analysts were accused of providing misleading advice on stocks.In the settlement yesterday Marsh agreed to return about half the $1.7 billion in incentive payments that it said it had received over four years from insurance companies. Mr. Cherkasky did not acknowledge that the incentive payments had increased the cost of insurance but he said Marsh agreed to the settlement to "put this behind us."Most of those that will receive restitution Mr. Cherkasky said are American businesses but some overseas companies that bought insurance through Marsh in New York will also be offered restitution.Mr. Cherkasky's carefully worded apology seemed to be intended to distance the company from further liability. But Mark Geistfeld a New York University professor who teaches insurance law said it was not clear that the strategy would succeed."The issue is going to be whether they are vicariously liable for the misconduct of their employees" Mr. Geistfeld said. But he added "The company's argument would be weakened by the fact that the misconduct benefited Marsh and not the individual employees."Vinay Saqi an analyst at Morgan Stanley said the agreement appeared to be "very manageable" for Marsh.The stock market seemed to agree. Marsh's shares which fell sharply after the Spitzer lawsuit rose $1.41 yesterday to close at $32.50. But that was still well below their price of $46.13 before Mr. Spitzer's lawsuit.

 9,Panama's decision to break off earlier talks through the Inter‐American Peace Committee and take her charge to the Council has deeply disturbed Latin‐American Governments. As a result new high‐level attempts to find a solution to the dispute are expected.In what was regarded as the most violent attack by a LatinAmerican government on the United States since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba Mr. Moreno said: “We shall live under the constant threat of an armed North American attack.”He contended that as long as the “justice” of Panama's demands for a revision of the 1903 Canal Zone treaty were not met “the aggression remains latent along the border that separates the zone of the canal from the rest of the republic.”“The armed forces of the United States are there in a state of alert to halt the people of Panama in the exercise of its rights” Dr. Moreno said and then asked:“Can the sister countries of America leave Panama abandoned to her own fate at the mercy of the will of a power filled with its own strength and that has demonstrated that it is disposed not to recognize the rights of the Panamanian nation and what is worse to force it to submit to injustice through force?”Specifically Mr. Moreno asked the Council to constitute itself a ministerial‐level “organ of consultation” order an investigation of the Canal Zone riots and condemn the United States for “aggression.”
 0,For Beijing 1949 was a big year. That’s when the People’s Republic was founded right here in the capital. It was also the year that the Beijing Machinery and Electric Institute opened a factory in the Sanlitun neighborhood. Nearly 60 years later that long-idle industrial ruin has become the centerpiece of one of the most unusual drinking and dining complexes in town. 1949-The Hidden City opened a few weeks ago and it’s drawing praise from diners architecture fans preservationists and my out-of-town visitors who get dragged there whether they want to or not.1949 was developed by Elite Concepts a Hong Kong company that operates restaurants there and in Shanghai Jakarta and Macau. The complex consists of nearly a dozen inter-connected buildings in a 55000-square-foot walled village. About half of that is covered with trees and grass making it an oasis of urban calm. Open so far are a Chinese restaurant a European restaurant a noodle bar a coffee-and-drinks bar and an art gallery. The original factory has been preserved and the same warm hue of red brick used to construct the other buildings. Interiors are brightened by extensive use of glass and wood.Food’s not bad either. Duck de Chine the Chinese restaurant offers a tasty wood-fired version of the iconic local specialty Peking duck for 188 yuan (about $27 at the current exchange rate of 6.9 yuan to the dollar). Its arrival is signaled by a gong and the bird is carved at your table. Good for impressing visitors. The menu includes duck several other ways but for variety’s sake you might want to try the many pork beef and noodle dishes. Oddly the restaurant has a marketing arrangement with Bollinger whose famous bubbly is the featured wine offering. Not the perfect accompaniment for duck perhaps but there is also a high-quality selection of reds and whites at typically elevated Beijing prices. Tip: the Ste. Michelle Riesling from Washington State one of the cheapest on the list at 345 yuan goes well with many Chinese dishes.The European restaurant 1/5 taverna has a cosmopolitan vaguely Spanish-tinged menu heavy on steaks seafood and pasta. One notable offering is the roast baby lamb from Mongolia (458 yuan for a shoulder 488 for a leg) which will feed six people. We had the leg with a Calina Reserva Carmenere a sturdy Chilean red for 388 yuan a bottle.The Noodle Bar seats only 12 people around a wooden oval and offers hand-pulled noodle dishes. The airy glass-enclosed Sugar Bar specializes in coffee concoctions but also has a full range of mixed drinks beers and wines. A more ambitious bar 1/5 is set to open any minute. So is the Well Bar a circular outdoor counter built atop an old fire-fighting well.1949-The Hidden City is so new that few taxi drivers know it. But the complex lies behind Pacific Century Place a glitz-bathed commercial and residential complex on Gong Ti Bei Lu between Sanlitun Nan Lu and the Third Ring Road. Better hurry: 1949 may not stay hidden for long.
 9,The stock market as a whole just finished one of its worst quarters ever. Virtually the only companies to show gains in a period dominated by crisis in the Persian Gulf were in natural resources particularly oil.''It was a difficult quarter'' said Robert S. Salomon director of stock research with Salomon Brothers Inc. ''If people didn't realize it before higher oil prices made many people realize that there is a recession on the way.

 9,Raising new questions about pollution at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island a former scientist there has charged that the lab has jeopardized local drinking water by draining millions of gallons of waste water into basins near an old radioactive ''hot spot.'' He voiced fear that waste water may have caused the radioactivity to penetrate the underground water supply.Article page 27.
 0,PhotoScientists have turned up ample evidence that consumption of seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids may help protect against cardiovascular disease. But the data have usually been indirect gleaned from food questionnaires used to estimate consumption.But now a new analysis relying on blood tests and years of clinical exams confirms that higher blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk for heart disease and death in people over age 65.The blood tests were used to track the levels of three different types of omega-3 in 2692 randomly selected people average age 74 at the start of the study for 14 years. All were generally healthy and without previous heart disease. None used fish oil supplements.The study was published online Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.There were 1625 deaths over the 14-year study period. The highest blood levels of the three kinds of omega-3 individually and combined were associated with the lowest total mortality and there was a dose-response relationship — that is as blood levels of omega-3 went up the risk for death declined.After adjustment for a number of variables those in the highest 20 percent in omega-3 blood levels were 27 percent less likely to die of any cause than those in the lowest fifth. Those with blood levels in the highest fifth were also 40 percent less likely to die of coronary heart disease and 48 percent less likely to die of an arrhythmia than those in the lowest fifth.There were fewer deaths from stroke in those with the highest levels of omega-3s but the difference was not statistically significant. Over all the researchers calculated that those with the highest omega-3 blood levels lived an average of 2.22 more years than those with lowest.The lead author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian an associate professor of medicine at Harvard said that the most beneficial levels could be achieved by consuming an average of 400 milligrams of omega-3s a day — the equivalent of weekly consumption of about 3.5 ounces of farmed salmon 5 ounces of anchovies or herring or 15 to 18 ounces of cod or catfish.While greater amounts may have some additional benefits he said “The most bang for the buck is going from zero to some.”Controlled trials have shown that omega-3 fatty acids have various beneficial physiological effects among them reduced heart rate lower blood pressure and lower triglyceride production. These effects are modest the researchers say but combined they could reduce mortality.Dr. Kenneth J. Mukamal an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard who was not involved in the study said the work confirmed “older clinical trials showing just this — that omega-3 oil prevented sudden cardiac death.”The finding that omega-3 levels were associated with lowered risk for death by specific causes Dr. Mozaffarian said is novel and important.“The specificity for heart disease and arrhythmias is very compelling for this being a cause-and-effect relationship” he said rather than an association based on general good health or other lifestyle factors.Still the authors acknowledge that there may be other variables they were unable to account for.Would omega-3 supplements work just as well as eating fish? “Some previous trials of supplements showed benefits” Dr. Mozaffarian said. “Some more recent have not. So I think it’s a little uncertain what’s going on.”In any case he said supplements may be the answer for some people: “If you don’t eat fish take supplements and if you want to take supplements in addition to eating fish no harm in doing that.”

 0,The ''Shorts Stop'' segments which begin this Sunday aim to show that music videos are related to the rock documentary at least in spirit. So these programs feature the work of independent filmmakers -- including Mr. Moore despite his antivideo stance -- who have crossed over in both directions.The series host Mark Anthony Thompson talks loftily about ''the cross-pollination of music and cinema'' -- at least as lofty as a man can be slouching on a couch and wearing sunglasses (indoors) and orange flip-flops. But the series proves mainly that interesting imagery distracts from good music and can't elevate lousy music and that annoying pictures can actually prove deafening. You simply tune out.The best work in the series comes not surprisingly from Spike Jonze who sprang exuberantly from the video world into film with the inventive ''Being John Malkovich'' (and more recently into the world of politics with his biographical documentary of Al Gore for the Democratic convention). His ''Oh So Quiet'' music video for the Icelandic pop star Bjork set in a Goodyear tire store is an extravagantly produced homage to Hollywood musicals of the 1930's. Bjork gleefully high-kicks and prances in an orange dress looking happy to be in this bright amusing little spectacle where the music and pictures actually seem to have something to do with one another (even if they don't).Another film director Hal Hartley has created an amusing mock concert for the English folk singer Beth Orton's ''Stolen Car.'' While singing Ms. Orton slyly assumes ''meaningful'' poses in various corners of a room flops on a couch and pretends not to notice the expressionless assistants sticking microphones in front of her mouth. She pricks her finger with the thorn of a rose and a drop of her blood lazily drifts through a glass of water. Mr. Hartley has artfully staged the video in grays and reds but I'd still rather listen to Ms. Orton's lovely voice with my eyes closed.As for the pugnacious Mr. Moore director (of ''Roger and Me'') and television crusader (on ''The Awful Truth'' and ''TV Nation'') he paired up with a band that could have been named just for him Rage Against the Machine. Mr. Moore has styled his video as just another of his impromptu assaults -- this one on the New York Stock Exchange. As Rage wails outside the exchange the police arrive. Mr. Moore confronts. The action is intercut with a parody of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' No daisy fields that's for sure.
 0,Aired Friday night on NBC: I had two kids come by for Halloween one dressed as Mickey Mouse the other dressed as an Acorn volunteer trying to register him to vote.Hey did you see Barack Obama on the news? He took time out to take his kids trick-or-treating but he would only let them take candy from households making over $200000 a year.Well gosh only four more days and then Sarah Palin has to give all those clothes back. It’s amazing isn’t it?This weekend daylight savings time. You know what that means? An extra hour for this stupid campaign.As you know a lot of voters in Florida have already cast their ballots using early voting. And here’s the weird part. George Bushhas been declared the winner again.In less than a week President Bushwill be a lame duck as opposed to just being a lame president.Well in a speech yesterday Joe the plumber said that John McCain is a real American. And who better to say who is a real American than a fake plumber?Joe the plumber has now signed for real with a publicist and a manager and he already has a book deal in the works. In fact we have an advanced copy right here. It’s called “Eat Pray Flush.”Oh what else? Well God bless John McCain. You know I’ve got to give McCain credit for ignoring the polls and fighting on. The guy’s a fighter. I mean he’s been declared dead by the pollsters and twice by his own doctor.And this week John McCain said people who live in coastal states like Florida should get more of the money from offshore drilling. I think that’s called spreading the wealth around isn’t it?And today Barack Obama’s campaign accused John McCain of looking in the rearview mirror which would make McCain the only guy over 70 who actually does that.

 9,Broadly speaking the growth of labor-intensive imports is not only inevitable but also desirable. Rising living standards have always depended on the ever more productive use of labor. Work by Americans that could be done as well but much more cheaply by Taiwanese or Turks represents historically a drag on the American economy. Moreover the United States has a major foreign policy interest in cheap manufacture abroad. The growth and stability of developing economies - and their demand for American-made goods - depends on their exports of low-wage products.Thanks to its flexible free-market system America continues to create jobs as rapidly as they are destroyed by changing world market conditions. Virtually everyone who is put out of work by imports eventually finds other employment. For clothing workers who earn $5 or $6 an hour the chances are that new jobs will pay as well or better.But these abstractions are no comfort for the workers and communities that depend on garment making. If Americans want to continue to benefit from cheap imports we must accept responsibility for what happens to these people and places. Congress tried in the 1970's by offering supplementary unemployment benefits for workers dislocated by imports. But this worthy first try was quickly labeled ''burial insurance'' by union leaders. The program inadequate though it was has been allowed to lapse.A better remedy in keeping with free-market principles would be to get serious about re-employing the dislocated and subsidizing their relocation. The Federal Government has never attempted systematically to match blue-collar workers with jobs in other regions the way white-collar workers are now routinely served by private employment agencies. Nor has Washington ever offered to help with moving expenses or tried to encourage relocation by retailing information about schools and housing. Nor has it ever made an intelligent enduring effort to teach new skills to those whose experience is no longer in demand.A prudent and humane society should neither resist desirable change nor cast aside its victims. American industry has always been on the move. New England was thrice transformed from dependence on farming fishing and commerce to shoe and textile manufacture to education high tech and insurance. We need such vital change to remain prosperous. It would be foolish to cement so many jobs into place in every town or state. But it is cruel and ultimately untenable to turn a deaf ear to those who need help in moving with the tides.

 9,ST. PETERSBURG March 31 —After losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates 8—4 at Al Lang Field today the New York Mets did a mountain of paper work concerning players. Actually however they moved only one man a young pitcher named Mike Joyce.They completed three conditional purchases made last fall added Ed Bauta a pitcher to the Met roster took Pat Garrett off and acquired Joyce from the Chicago White Sox on waivers.In a conditional purchase a team pays a certain amount—perhaps $5000—to examine the merchandise. If it wants to keep the player it then pays the remainder of the agreed ‐ upon price.This is the situation under which Amado Samuel a shortstop; Bob Taylor a catcher and Larry Elliot an outfielder have been playing this spring. The Mets have decided to keep all three. So today they paid the rest of the money owed to Milwaukee for Samuel and Taylor ( a total estimated at $60000 ) and to the Pittsburgh organization for Elliot.

 9,Question: How can I track the performance of mutual funds that are not listed by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system?Answer: To qualify for a listing with Nasdaq which provides fund data for most newspapers and magazines a fund generally must have either $25 million in assets or 1000 or more shareholders. Today about 3100 funds are Nasdaq-listed and 217 are not according to Morningstar Inc. fund researchers in Chicago.Tracking the performance of nonlisted funds on a daily basis is almost impossible said John Rekenthaler editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds an investing newsletter. Some financial publications however publish weekly quotations and more do so on a quarterly basis.While nonlisted funds tend to be small and relatively new that's not always the case said Gerald W. Perritt editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago. He recommends two no-load growth funds that are small but do have solid histories: Crabbe Huson Special (until recently Crabbe Huson Growth) in Portland Ore. a value fund and the Fasciano Fund in Chicago which owns shares in small companies.

 9,''Circumcision'' she said ''evolved from a religious ritual and puberty rite to a routine prophylactic practice for newborns that is unnecessary and exposes infants not only to severe pain but the possible infection that has been fatal in some cases. And when you realize how much parents pay for circumcision $75 to $125 you realize how much money is involved; circumcision is a $100 million-a-year industry.'' Circumcisions and InsuranceIndeed high stakes are involved in the debate over circumcision. In California Pennsylvania Maine Washington and Delaware the Blue Shield insurance organization no longer pays benefits for circumcisions saying they are medically unnecessary When Blue Shield of Pennsylvania stopped its coverage for the procedure in early 1987 it estimated it would save at least $1.3 million a year.Circumcision has been practiced in some human societies for at least 6000 years according to medical historians. As a religious ritual it continues to be practiced by Jews Moslems certain tribes in Africa and other groups.The belief that all infant boys regardless of their religious faith should be circumcised began to take root in this country in the latter half of the 19th century when some physicians advocated it for reasons of hygiene and suggested it reduced the spread of infection and venereal disease. Some Victorian-era physicians and clergymen also suggested circumcision would discourage masturbation. Steady Decline Since 1971As recently as 1970 according to physicians' estimates almost 90 percent of newborn boys in the United States were circumcised. But since the American Academy of Pediatrics' 1971 report which found no basis for those endorsements there has been a steady decline in the proportion of infant boys who are circumcised.In 1986 the last year for which data are available it was 59.4 percent according to the National Center for Health Statistics of the Department of Health and Human Services.This data suggest many American physicians are continuing to encourage parents to have their sons circumcised despite the 1971 report apparently reflecting a belief that while the operation may be medically unnecessary it is not harmful. Some physicians say some couples request circumcision even after being advised of the report because the father of a newborn boy was himself circumcised and considers it ''normal'' or it is feared that their child might someday be ridiculed by other boys.

 0,Barton Silverman/The New York TimesTwo boys one with a glove stood on the field behind home plate Wednesday and watched Mets left fielder Jason Bay hit a batting-practice pitch so hard that one of the boys was sure the ball would leave Citi Field.“Aww that is gone! Home run!” the boy said.The ball confronted by the humidity in the air and the roominess of the park died at the warning track.“I thought that was gone!” the boy said.He was not the first to be fooled.Bay hit six batting-practice home runs and Ronny Paulino hit the facing of the second deck in left field. Jason Pridie hit the facing in right. But even batting practice with easy 40-foot pitches was hardly a power show for the Mets.Besides being short-handed or partly because they are short-handed the Mets have become home-run-challenged. They took a 10-game streak without a home run into Wednesday’s game against Pittsburgh their longest such streak in 21 years.The Mets went a team-record 17 games without a home run from Aug. 27 to Sept. 13 1980. That 1980 team which went 67-95 also had streaks of 13 and 12 games without a home run according to Baseball-Reference.com.Their current streak ended in the eighth when Justin Turner hit one to left — perhaps the only highlight in a 9-3 loss. Turner’s shot also ended a 10-game streak without a home run at Citi Field. The last time they did that at home was from Sept. 9-20 1979 when they played at Shea Stadium.Both streaks underline the continuing debate about Citi Field whose large dimensions and high walls in left field have seemed to prove vexing in particular to David Wright and Bay. They have also raised questions about whether the Mets should move home plate out or bring the fences in.“To me it’s a perfect park because I’m not a home run hitter” center fielder Angel Pagan said. But Wright and Bay are.Daniel Murphy had been the last Met to hit a home run on May 20 but that was at Yankee Stadium. Pridie had been the last Met to hit a home run at Citi Field on May 6 against the Dodgers. The Mets entered the day with 37 home runs fewer than any National League team except Houston. “I think it’s the result of the lineup” Mets Manager Terry Collins said before the game referring to injuries to Wright and Ike Davis. “I actually have not seen guys who look like they’re overswinging.”“It’s difficult for me to have an opinion on it” he added in reference to Citi Field.Pagan can offer recent examples of how it cuts both ways. He made a magnificent running catch near the 415-foot sign in right-center field to help preserve the Mets’ victory over the Pirates on Monday but he hit a shot near the same spot that was caught Tuesday.
 9,Spring arrived officially in the world of ballet on Saturday night at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College where the Ballet Concierto de Puerto Rico spread its usual warmth and the joy of its vital classicism. The program covered many themes and styles. But the three New York premieres had in common a refreshing directness and imagination."Jayanes (Strong Supple Men)" a dance for four men that was choreographed by Alberto Mendez to music by Hindemith would look just right in an Olympics performance. Rooted to the center of the stage the men move mostly over and around one another using bodies as balances and levers creating a human tangle of a jungle gym. They're athletes but "Jayanes" is as much an ode to the dignity of the human body as it is a celebration of youth strength and virility. The quartet was performed by Edwin Silfa Carlos Raul Sierra Armando Seda and Roberto Lopez."The House of Bernarda Alba" the Garcia Lorca play about the repressed lives of a Spanish mother and her daughters has inspired too many dances. But the choreographer Julio Lopez manages to say something fresh about that brood of fateful hens in "La Casa de Bernarda Alba" set to an appropriately obsessive score by Frank Martin. Mr. Lopez is helped by Carlos Gazzaniga's stark backdrop of a towering hallway chair and door though the door looks uncharacteristically unornamented for a Spanish household. The performers were first-rate. And Mr. Lopez tells his story crisply through expressive bodies assuming stylized shapes and through a few shocking images.A small bridal veil is used to touching effect first as it is contemplated longingly then put on by Angustias the eldest daughter of the household just as her sister Adela seduces and runs off with Angustias's fiance. The absence of that subsequently discarded veil which Adela looks for with wide-eyed pain on her return suggests how very strong the prison bars of this household are even for those who escape. Adela's dream of escape is communicated poignantly in a high lift in which she seems to surge upward out of her lover's arms and into open air. The introduction of Garcia Lorca as a Christ figure is a little confusing. But a duet for the mother Bernarda Alba and the alter ego who scorns her is a revealing addition.

 0,When President Bush announced his support last week for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage his body language in the Roosevelt Room did not seem to match his words. Mr. Bush may have forcefully defended the union of a man and a woman as ''the most fundamental institution of civilization'' but even some White House officials said he appeared uncomfortable.When Mr. Bush finished his five-minute statement -- with reporters arranged before him in White House-assigned seats waiting for the news conference that appeared to be coming -- he abruptly turned on his heel and strode from the room ignoring all questions.''Is he coming back?'' a television reporter called out.He was not.Mr. Bush was acting under enormous pressure from his evangelical Christian supporters who had intensified their demands in recent months that the president speak out in defense of traditional marriage. His more moderate supporters on the other hand worried that he might look like a gay basher.Mr. Bush's friends say that is hardly the case and that the president is quite comfortable with gays. Laura Bush when asked in a recent interview by The New York Times if she and her husband had gay friends easily replied: ''Sure of course. Everyone does.''
 9,IT is time for food lovers to sing an enthusiastic happy 10th birthday to Mirabelle. A decade ago the small French restaurant in an unobtrusive converted house on Route 25A in St. James skyrocketed in popularity and is still there.On a recent visit comments by first-timers were telling. On entering the dining room one asked "Is there another room?" Another added "It's not what I expected."Mirabelle is neither large nor imposing. The dining room is subdued tasteful and comfortable. Nosegays of flowers and votive candles top the tables. Soft lighting from old-fashioned wall fixtures bathe pale peach walls. Green ceramic plates a few small pictures and a floral arrangement placed beside an antique gilt mirror set the stage.Decor is not what Mirabelle is about. The marvelous food created by Guy Reuge the chef and owner is the star here. The supporting players are the waiters and waitresses who provide consistently splendid service.

Sasser will be sent to the Pirates' Vancouver farm club. . . . The Boston Red Sox placed Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd on the 15-day disabled list with a shoulder problem and activated Steve Crawford a reliever. . . . Jim Deshaies a left-handed pitcher with the Houston Astros also has a shoulder problem and was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to July 26. The Astros called up Jeff Heathcock a pitcher from the Tucson farm club.
 0,"Riverdale is a hotbed because it has an affluent intellectual and verbal community and several platforms for debate including two community newspapers that compete and keep the dialogue going" said Charles G. Moerdler chairman of the community board's land use committee. Among the more controversial developments are the projects being put up by Shmuel Jonas and Joseph Korff.When it became clear last fall that a new zoning regulation was about to pass that would limit new construction to eight stories in parts of central Riverdale both developers raced the clock to get their foundations in the ground under the old rules.David Mandl the architect of the Jonas project called Arlington Suites a 13-story building going up on an irregular parcel between Arlington and Netherland Avenues recalled how the developer managed to get the building going before the new rules took effect. "We compressed six months of work into 45 days digging out bedrock excavating and pouring 18399 square feet of foundation" he said. "On Sept. 27 I went to the Buildings Department myself and got the last permit at 3:45 p.m. They shut the permit window at 4 p.m. The next morning the City Planning Commission voted to change the zoning restricting heights to 70 feet."Though he encountered several challenges to the project's eligibility for coverage under the old code which requires that the foundation be virtually complete he did get a stamp of approval from the Board of Standards and Appeals."It is all over" Mr. Mandl said triumphantly. "This is the last tall building in Riverdale."Well not quite. Mr. Korff's condominium project on a mostly vacant parcel at 237th Street and the Henry Hudson Parkway will rise to 19 stories. The new regulations limit building heights in a 30-block area of central Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil. They also confine new construction in north Riverdale to single-family and semidetached dwellings.Developers working in other parts of Riverdale will not have those restrictions -- at least not for now. But rezoning is being considered for other areas.Some of the new projects sit on land occupied until recently by small homes inciting arguments about scale context and scarcity of parking. Others are going up on vacant lots raising environmental hackles. In fact regulations governing the Special Natural Area District which was created in 1975 to protect the topography and plant and marine life were tightened in February..

 9,Warnings by the Reagan Administration that it would oppose further World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank loans if Chile's leaders did not improve their human rights record appear to have shaken the ruling junta a bit. According to the Center for International Policy Chile asked that final consideration of some $250 million in multilateral development bank loans be postponed until November.They had originally been scheduled for consideration in September or October.Recently Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams warned that if Chile did not move toward a democracy the Administration would oppose any of the new loans. Chile's President Gen. Augusto Pinochet in turn threatened to stop payment on all of Chile's $20 billion in foreign debt the highest per capita in South America.But that could just be necessary grandstanding. Future financing that might total $1.5 billion from private banks appears to hinge on Chile's good standing with the World Bank and the development bank. As such although the loan was in the final stages of approval ''Chile claimed that it needed additional time to get its economic plans in order before presenting the loan to the World Bank executive board'' the international policy center said.
 9,Mr. Dinkins is seeking concessions from city unions in an effort to avert some or all of the layoffs and late last night city officials were considering a proposal from union leaders that would avert many layoffs through a wage deferral an early-retirement program and stepped up attrition.City officials discounted the possiblity of an imminent agreement. Asked if he was optimistic Barry Feinstein the teamsters union leader said: "It depends on what they come back with. All the elements for a solution are on the table."In reaching an agreement Mr. Dinkins was forced to give way on tax increases that he had fought vigorously for over many weeks and to embrace a budget that included service cuts he considered unthinkable only a few months ago.But at the same time succeeding in putting together any kind of budget at all under such adverse circumstances could serve the Mayor well in the face of relentless questioning of his administration's ability to manage the city's affairs. And it also makes calls for a takeover of the city's finances by the state's Financial Control Board seem a far more distant possibility. Sweet Compromise for SomeFor the often maligned Council the compromise was sweet. By fighting both for lower taxes and fewer service cuts Council members gained political capital to use in the November elections. And by dropping plans to pass their own budget -- after establishing it as a credible threat -- they avoided the risks of a prolonged fight with the Mayor.The budget agreement came so late that negotiators said it would take most of the night to fill in all the details and most of today to print the budget delaying the adoption until tonight at the earliest. Some Council aides said the delay was the longest in at least several decades.But with the city's fiscal problems so severe many officials were predicting that whatever budget was put into place now would soon change to take into account concessions from municipal unions or the further decline in the city's fiscal picture forecast by the City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.

 0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students learn about the orbital space plane NASA’s proposed spacecraft of the future. They then work in groups to plan missions to take place twenty years from now and design orbital space planes in which to carry out the missions.Author(s):Annissa Hambouz The New York Times Learning NetworkBridget Anderson The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Consider the future of space travel and exploration.2. Learn about the orbital space plane NASA’s proposed spacecraft of the future by reading and discussing the article “NASA Goes Shopping for a Shuttle Successor Off the Rack.”3. Work in groups to plan future space missions for orbital space planes.4. Individually design orbital space planes created to carry out their group’s mission; compare designs and create a final plane design; present missions and plane designs to the class.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils-paper-student journals-classroom board-copies of the article “NASA Goes Shopping for a Shuttle Successor Off the Rack” (one per student)-computers with Internet accessActivities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Student respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “Imagine the future of space travel. How do you think space exploration might change or develop over the next twenty years? Do you think possibilities such as space tourism or lunar land development are realistic visions? Why or why not?” Allow students a few minutes to share their responses. As a class discuss the many ways that space travel has developed since NASA’s inception over 40 years ago. What are some of the vehicles that have been developed for space missions? How have the vehicles for human missions evolved over time?2. As a class read and discuss the article “NASA Goes Shopping for a Shuttle Successor Off the Rack” using the following questions:a. What is a space plane according to the article?b. What is the purpose of an orbital space plane?c. Why are some people critical of the orbital space plane?d. What is the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science Committee?e. How much money has been spent on the space plan program thus far according to the article?f. How much more does NASA plan to spend through 2007 for developing the plane?g. To what does the expression “KISS” refer and how does it relate to the space program according to the article?h. Which aerospace companies are competing to design the craft?i. How much has each company been paid to create designs according to the article?j. What does NASA expect the space plane to look like?3. Divide students into small groups. Explain that each group’s assignment is to plan a space mission to take place twenty years from now and then to design an orbital space plane to carry out the mission. Each group should first visit NASA’s Web site for kids which contains detailed information on the orbital space plane “Orbital Space Plane-Commuting to Space” (//kids.msfc.nasa.gov/news/2003/news-OSP.asp). Alternately if computers are not available the Web page can be printed out for students to read.After reading more about the plane each group will be responsible for planning its mission to take place twenty years from now. Mission plans must include the following information (written on the board for easier student access):–Destination of the mission–Purpose of the mission–Length of time the mission will take–People who will take part in the mission (number of pilots/participants and their roles)–How the mission will help advance our understanding of space–Realistic funding necessary for the development and execution of this mission (extra credit)Each group should initially jot down their responses to these different areas of their mission plan and then develop a more formal written plan that incorporates their ideas. Plans should not exceed three typed pages.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: After groups have completed their mission plans each member of the group will design an orbital space plane to carry out the mission. The plane designs should meet the following criteria (written on the board for students to copy prior to leaving class):–Must clearly demonstrate how the craft will accommodate the number of people designated for the mission–Must show where equipment and supplies will be stored on the plane (with an accompanying list of these supplies)–Must contain technology for communicating with Earth–Must offer at least one special feature that will assist in the plane’s missionIn a later class groups should reconvene to share and compare their designs. Each group should then create a final space plane design by combining and modifying members’ plans and present their missions to the class.Further Questions for Discussion:–If you were on the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee do you think you would support more funding for the orbital space plane? Why or why not?–Do you think they orbital space plane should be NASA’s focus for the future? Why or why not? If not what types of crafts do you think would best suit the program’s future goals?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses participation in class and small group discussions thoughtful group mission plans individual space plane designs and final group mission and plane design presentation.Vocabulary:orbital complement disintegrated subcommittee aerospaceExtension Activities:1. Create a “How It Works” poster to illustrate how one of the currently employed space crafts works. What technology did it replace? How was it different? What is it able to do that previous crafts could not? What are its limitations? See the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum Web site for research help (//www.nasm.si.edu/galleries/gal114/SpaceRace/sec500/sec542.htm).2. Research and create an illustrated timeline or children’s book of space exploration from its conception to today. What were some the famous crafts and their missions? Who are some of the astronauts associated with the missions and why are they well-known?3. If space tourism ever became a reality how do you think a typical “tour” would work? Design a travel brochure for a vacation in outer space.Interdisciplinary Connections:Economics- Debate whether money should be used for development of the orbital space plane as the next generation of space shuttle. Consider the fact that the United States government has a fixed budget and money used for certain programs means that money will not be available for other programs. Split the class into two opposing sides: pro-governmental funding of the space airplane and anti-governmental funding of the space airplane. To prepare for your debate research the space airplane proposal to back up your argument with figures. You may also wish to visit the NASA Web site (//www.nasa.gov) and look for press releases and other documents from the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science Committee (//www.house.gov/science).Language Arts- On airplanes there is a standard set of rules instructions and demonstrations that flight attendants are required to explain to passengers. Write a similar script for a flight attendant to explain to those aboard an orbital space plane. Be sure to include details such as how to locate emergency equipment and exits a description of safety features etc. Take into account what passengers will experience on a space flight (such as weightlessness) what safety equipment they might require and other unique concerns.Mathematics- The article read in class mentions that one consideration for a new orbital space plane design is how to get an ill astronaut from the space station to Earth in 24 hours. Research the distance from the space station to the landing spot on Earth and the speed of the shuttle in order to calculate the time it takes for a shuttle to touch down on Earth from disembarking from the space station. Take into account factors such as the space station as a moving target (the distance between a landing runway and the space station is not constant). How might a new craft be able to expedite the shuttle’s trip?Other Information on the Web:Orbital Space Plane (//www.orbital.com/LaunchVehicle/SpacePlane/) provides a detailed description of the O.S.P.NASA (//www.nasa.gov) runs the United States’ space program.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Science Standard 3- Understands essential ideas about the composition and structure of the universe and the Earth’s place in it.

 9,The National Labor Relations Board has ordered its regional offices to provide new training to employees who handle inquiries about workers' rights a move stemming from a study by an anti-union group that said the board often provided inaccurate information.William G. Stack the board's acting associate general counsel ordered the training in a memorandum earlier this month to the agency's field directors.Mr. Stack also told the regional offices to determine whether board officers quoted in a recent report by the National Right to Work Committee had in fact provided the information attributed to them in the group's report.Mr. Stack declined comment when asked whether the labor board agreed that some of its information officers had provided inaccurate information. But when asked why he had ordered new training he said ''Any time I find out that there is a need for training the correct thing to do is see that the training is conducted.''
 0,Jimmy Conrad is a pretty boy who has a hankering for some ugly soccer.“What this league needs is a team like the Oakland Raiders” said Conrad the new fresh face of KickTV on YouTube a joint venture of Google Soccer United Marketing (the commercial arm of Major League Soccer) and Bedrocket Media Ventures. “Every league needs a team to hate. Players to dislike.”YouTubeSome might disagree with Conrad a former M.L.S. and United States national team defender. Guys like Los Angeles Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena who is partial to the Dynasty Theory as in what every league needs is a Yankees or Celtics … teams on a pedestal setting the standard for others to attempt to match. It is all open for debate.What is certain these days is that the appetite of soccer fans for ever more soccer — or content in the language of the Internet age — can never be satisfied.“I think that all sports probably benefit from the Internet in that it allows fans to truly immerse themselves” said Brian Bedol of Bedrocket Media Ventures by telephone from his offices in the Soho section of Manhattan. “I’ve been involved in sports on the Internet for a decade now having launched College Sports TV and operated some 300 sites for major university sports programs. I’ve realized that fans are not just looking for games on TV. When they’re connected to a team and a sport they want total immersion.“Starting from the level of sports fans using the Internet in multiple way to support their passion I would say soccer is a sport that globally benefited from the Internet in a huge way because of the nature of the game.”He added: “Soccer is a global sport and that is part of what makes it so unique and engaging. It’s not just about what’s going on in your own backyard. American sports media over the last 25 years until recently has focused on the major American sports and had a lack of shelf space committed to covering soccer. Fans immediately were drawn to the Net as a place to get a wealth of coverage to satisfy their interest.”KickTV is part of an effort by YouTube which is owned by Google to seed budding professional producers with $100 million to start channels dedicated to all and sundry topics from dancing to self-help to sports.According to a recent article in USA Today a survey by Nielsen found that the average person is currently watching 30 minutes of video online a week though the figure is 60 minutes for people between the ages of 25 and 34. And when it comes to soccer that is the prime sweet spot for advertisers interested in a generally well-educated co-ed fan base that has embraced the game locally and globally.KickTV is a channel dedicated to presenting original programming and features with on-air talent that includes Conrad; the former Liverpool player and New England Revolution coach Steve Nicol; the former Houston and current Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden; and the English Olympian Jo Ankier.“This has a much broader focus than the content on MLSsoccer.com” said Chris Schlosser the general manager of M.L.S. Digital. “Kick was created as a global channel that allows us to tell the key soccer stories of the day and to broaden our voice beyond the M.L.S. channel. All the content is original and exclusive to the channel and YouTube.”The channel which launched March 2 currently has more than 10000 subscribers who have viewed nearly 2 million videos.“We’re not trying to create ESPN” Schlosser said. “This is something specific for an audience that wants a lighter voice than the official M.L.S. site. It’s intended to be fun and informative with content you can’t get anywhere else. I see it as the home for soccer fans on YouTube; when they get up in the morning they can go to KickTV to see what’s up in the soccer world.”The channel’s current offerings include: the Mixer (a daily wrapup of the game around the globe); the Whip (a weekly review of top stories from England’s Premier League); Champions League Whip (a review of top stories from the UEFA tournament); No Holden Back (featuring the stylings of Bolton’s Holden); Kick Academy (drills and exercises offered by professional coaches); Kick Classic (pop-up video style for great games in the site’s archive); and Kick Profiles (in-depth looks at the world’s best players).“At some point there could be live games on Kick” Bedol said. “But for now we want to provide the ultimate destination for fans to hang out between games and get smarter about teams and the game around the world.”He added: “On cable programming was only available to the number of homes the operators gave access to. It was never global. On this platform anyone who’s interested in seeing it from anywhere in the world can get access. In cable you’re in a gated community. On YouTube your in a world of literally millions. It has the ability to be a game changer.”Where do you go for your soccer fix on the Internet?Follow JackBell on Twitter.

 9,ATLANTA May 1—As part of President Carter's plan for “Voluntary” control of inflation; the Administration is prepared to subpoena corporate records and publicly criticize companies that do not hold down prices the director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability said here today.The director. Barry F. Bosworth also said that the Administration would press business executives to hold their salary increases to 5 percent and would ask “high visibility unions” to accept much smaller increases in new contracts.Mr. Bosworth who was speaking at a luncheon at the annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers’ As- sociation said that doctors dentists lawyers and other professional groups would also be called upon “in the very near future” to hold down increases in their fees.The speech by the 35-year-old econo mist was one of the bluntest by a high official since thd start of the Administration's effort to limit inflation by exhortation rather than through wage and price controls.

 0,At Auburn in 2003 he shared backfield time with Ronnie Brown and Carnell Williams who were selected second and fifth over all in the draft in April. Jacobs then transferred to Southern Illinois where he rushed for 922 yards and 19 touchdowns last season.Along the way coaches have broached the topic of changing his position. At Auburn he tried tight end and linebacker when he realized he was not the top running back."None of it worked" he said. "None of it was me. I tried but I had to do what was best for me."He parlayed that into a chance with the Giants a team with an annual vacancy for a backup running back.Barber said he thought Cloud would fill the role admirably this year and that Jacobs and Derrick Ward a second-year player represented the future. In recent seasons it has been far too easy for Giants coaches to leave Barber on the field for nearly every play. He has been increasingly productive; he rushed for a career-high and franchise-record 1518 yards last season despite playing behind a leaky offensive line. He is the franchise leader in rushing yards (6927) and receptions (474 catches).Despite his age 30 and his high-mileage body Barber says he believes he has several seasons of success ahead."I think it's a myth that's being disproved as the years go on by guys like myself and Curtis Martin and Corey Dillon who's 30 as well" Barber said. "It's all a function of how much work you put in how you take care of your body how you keep yourself healthy."I've been able to do that the last few years. As long as you still have the desire you can play this game as long as you want. Eventually you'll slow down."

 9,Following are excerpts from a transcript of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington yesterday on the nomination of Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States as recorded by The New York Times:SENATOR HOWARD M. METZENBAUM Democrat of Ohio: Mr. Justice: as this hearing develops I think it's on a double track. One part of the track - maybe a triple track - has to do with your ability to lead the Court to be that individual who can weld the Court together. The second part relates to whether indeed you are an extremist and relates to some of your opinions. But there's a third part that probably disturbs me as much or maybe more than any of the first two portions. That has to do and I want to use the most sensitive language I can with your credibility with the honesty of your representations to this body in 1971 and at the present time as well.On the voter-challenge issue we have the matter of your making a specific representation to the committee at that time and then we have the total disavowal yesterday with respect - as pertains to the facts and that's an issue that is still left unanswered because the witnesses won't be here until tomorrow but it has to do not with whether you did or didn't do something but whether you did or did not represent the facts correctly to this body.Then the second part of that whole credibility question relates to your answers to Senator Leahy yesterday that you didn't know of the typed-in restrictive covenant. This was a boilerplate form had a typed-in restrictive covenant with reference to selling or leasing your property to any member of the Hebrew race.Well just as a - on its face sometimes typed in - a good lawyer excellent scholar - certainly would have been normal to expect you would have noted that. And I guess as as one of the most knowledgeable people that probably graduated Stamford - high honors - everybody agrees you're extremely intelligent you don't have to be a - this whole thing almost stands out - Hebrew race. No such thing as a Hebrew race. It's a Hebrew religion. I mean that would obviously a point that almost would stand out and so when you say you didn't know about it that concerns me. It's bad enough that it's in the deed. It's worse if it was in the deed and if you knew about it in your representation to the committee.

 0,In fact at a recent holiday party soon after the renovation Ms. Gund ushered in guests to see not the reborn kitchen but a video playing a continuous loop. The work ''Dicing Nature'' opens with a scene of the empty kitchen with a vase of flowers in one corner. Then Mr. Shapiro's nephew Bryan Calvert a chef who owns Cafe Atlas on Central Park South appears and slices up a grapefruit. In the next scene a waterfall gushes from a ceiling vent gradually filling the room with water. A couple of fish swim by. ''It's about the displacement of nature the interaction between the use of food and nature and our perception of nature'' Mr. Dochantschi said taking a stab at clarifying the plot.At the party for the Museum of Modern Art's membership committee guests were riveted especially by a vase of purple and white orchids on a bookshelf captured by a discreetly placed camera and inserted into the video. ''You can't tell what's real and what's been filmed before'' said Neal Meltzer an art consultant while watching a scene showing the Cornue stove and the flowers dissolving into clouds in a blue sky. ''It's a little like a Magritte.'' As the party wound down guests began turning the camera on themselves so that they too appeared in the video as the kitchen flooded.Considering that people are spending more and more time in the kitchen it was probably inevitable that art would find its way there as well said Glenn D. Lowry director of the Museum of Modern Art. The idea that it could be ''not just a place to cook and chat over a meal but actually a place for thinking about art was brilliant'' he said.It took three months to make the video -- almost as long as the renovation -- using software by Peter Flaherty a video artist who worked on ''Alladeen'' a mixed-media presentation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last month. The jazziest aspect of the Gund-Shapiro video is the projection of a live image -- at the party it was the orchids -- into the recorded clip. As it turned out buying fish at the fish market in Chinatown and keeping them alive was almost as difficult.The 20-minute video was included in the budget for the project. (Mr. Dochantschi and his clients declined to discuss how much was spent except to say that it was about the same as for an off-the-shelf kitchen from a high-end European company.) Ms. Gund said that at first she was skeptical about the video ''but when Markus explained it better as being about the difference between what you think you're eating and what you really eat I thought it was such a fun idea.'' The flat-screen monitor positioned next to the table also serves as a computer a DVD player and a television set.The Gund-Shapiro kitchen is Mr. Dochantschi's first. The only other project he has completed in the United States is the renovation of a town house in Greenwich Village for Hyatt Bass a daughter of Sid and Anne Bass and her husband Josh Klausner. He approached the 400-square-foot kitchen with the intensity of a young architect with ideas to burn and much to prove. Today's kitchen is highly complex and layered he said like a Joseph Cornell box.''It has to work on contradictory levels'' he said ''as a professional space for entertaining a normal home kitchen and an extension of the living room.''
 9,The race covered 137.85 miles or 17 circuits of an 8.11-mile course through the upscale Buckhead section north of downtown. With the cloud cover and the 73-degree temperature making the 84 percent humidity almost tolerable this was the fastest road race in Olympic history. The first two finishers were timed in 4 hours 53 minutes 56 seconds an average speed of 28.1 miles an hour.For a year Armstrong had been saying that he would rather win the Olympic gold medal than the Tour de France. But bronchitis and a slight strep infection less than a month ago forced him out of the Tour de France and hurt his conditioning and today he was a victim of the erratic tactics of the pack.''Am I disappointed?'' he said. ''Yes and no. I have to be realistic. It's a long year and this is just a one-day race. People who expect wins every time don't know cycling.''With typical bravado Armstrong bolted to the front with 40 miles to go. ''I always feel like I need to give it a try'' he said. ''That's what it's all about taking risks. Some work and some do not.''This one did not because Richard and Sorensen soon joined him. Although the three took turns in the lead to conserve strength they never got more than 15 seconds ahead. The pack soon caught up. With 24 1/2 miles to go Armstrong attacked again. He even saved a fraction of a second by cutting through a service station. But the big guns closed in and with 19 miles to go he was caught.
 9,"Legacy" is Michael Wood's search for the sources of religious thought that have endured into the 20th century. In the six-hour series which begins tomorrow at 8 P.M. on Channel 13 the English writer and narrator of such upscale productions as "Art of the Western World" and "In Search of the Trojan War" goes to Iraq India China Egypt Central America and finally to what he calls "the barbarian West" to learn how the past has shaped or misshaped the present.The programs move so fast over such distances of space and time that you may feel left behind. (A map or two might have helped viewers to orient themselves particularly in the Orient.) But Mr. Wood's breathless enthusiasm and the evocative scenes notably the festivals in India that continue to draw millions of villagers to Mother Ganges carry one along.The first two-hour segment begins in Iraq by the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates where civilization is said to have begun and out of which came the Biblical accounts of the Flood and the Ark. In the area that entered the Bible as the Garden of Eden which Mr. Wood visited shortly before the Persian Gulf war he finds "a blasted landscape"; that not unexpectedly prompts him to reflect on the damage done by the overexploitation of nature's resources.Although he is critical of many aspects of Western civilization Mr. Wood shows himself to be a good liberal Englishman at heart. The societies that stir his enthusiasm are those like ancient Baghdad where many religions coexisted in a spirit of peaceful pluralism. He is pleased with the thought that Abraham the humane father of Judaism Christianity and Islam may have ruled for a time over a piece of what is now Iraq. In the second hour on India he focuses fondly on Hinduism which has traditionally found room for a variety of beliefs despite a lamentable propensity of some of the faithful to slaughter Muslims and other non-Hindus from time to time.

 9,Two sections of stage seats had to be set up at Alice Tully Hall to accommodate the overflow for Thursday night's recital by Renee Fleming. In the last three years this American soprano has deservedly won an ardent following; she is now central to the artistic future of the Metropolitan Opera. But this means there may be few chances to hear her again in a hall so intimate which will be unfortunate. Ms. Fleming used it to advantage in this remarkable recital.There were many musical opportunities for Ms. Fleming to unleash the full resources of her voice for example the resplendent top notes that capped Strauss's ecstatic "Cacilie" and Turina's sultry Spanish "Besa el aura." Even during her winsome elegantly restrained performance of Poulenc's "Fiancailles pour rire" songs her voice had shimmering presence and warmth.But on this night in this hall it was the range and quality of her soft singing that were especially impressive. She captured the sense of quietude and calm at the core of Schubert's gentle "Du bist die Ruh." And the sustained soft lines in his "Nacht und Traume" were rendered with affecting repose.The only slight flaws in Ms. Fleming's singing were some occasional intonation problems and these always seemed a result of attempts to create a particular nuance or shading. Ms. Fleming's artistry is deeply expressive without being mannered.
 9,MARK DUFFNER who coached Holy Cross to a perfect 11-0 season in 1991 received a five-year contract yesterday to revive the University of Maryland program."Our goal is to bring Maryland football back into a position of prominence" said Duffner who will receive a $120000 annual base salary. "But it won't be a quick fix."Duffner 38 years old and from Annandale Va. replaces JOE KRIVAK who resigned Dec. 6 after compiling a 20-34-2 record including 2-9 in 1991 in five years as the Terrapins' head coach.Holy Cross has the longest winning streak in college football at 20 games. Duffner's Crusader teams also graduated 91 of 95 seniors and had three academic all-Americans. (AP)
 0,A lawyer for the city said that although the city had agreed to send out the directives the city maintains that no new policy of selective-enforcement has ever been instituted and that the increase in arrests merely reflects a sharp increase in the number of contacts between officers and homeless people.''There were more arrests because there was more activity'' the lawyer Gail Donoghue special assistant to the corporation counsel said. She described the directives as ''a confirmation of our existing policy and practice.''''The policy was and is as part of Police Department training and procedures that people are treated the same'' Ms. Donoghue said. ''But we didn't have these things written out.''''It is our policy'' she added. ''We have no reason not to write it down.''A police spokesman had no additional comment.The lawsuit charged that after reports in the news media last fall about a significant increase in the number of homeless people on the streets top police officials directed the Homeless Outreach Unit to change its mission from one of offering services to arrest. The suit said that officers had also been told that they were not to enforce the law in a similar manner against people who were not homeless.The new directives have been read aloud at 10 consecutive roll calls of the Homeless Outreach Unit and the Transit Bureau and distributed to individual officers the documents show.They also offer guidance to members of the Homeless Outreach Unit when carrying out their duties. For example if an officer finds a person stretched out on a subway seat or a park bench the officer must first ''take appropriate corrective action.''

 0,DUKE--Anthony. Anthony "Tony" Drexel Duke (1918-2014). It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to our beloved founder Anthony "Tony" Drexel Duke founder and president of Boys & Girls Harbor. Tony died on April 30 2014 after a long battle with cancer. He was 95. The entire Harbor community while grieving Tony's death will observe his passing by celebrating his extraordinary legacy. Tony spent a lifetime educating children growing Boys & Girls Harbor the education and performing arts nonprofit he founded in 1937 from a small summer camp for 12 inner-city boys to an arts and education organization that serves 1000 students and their families from Harlem and surrounding communities. To date more than 50000 young people have attended the Harbor. Tony's compassion and generous gifts were widely known among New York's charitable circles but he was far more than just a patron. From the Harbor's early days until a few years before his death Tony was a fixture at the organization developing personal relationships with Harbor staff students and alumni. He made sure that the Harbor served as a real home and learning environment for students. The Harbor deeply mourns the loss of Tony a true living legend.
 0,WASHINGTON — President Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has contradicted Mr. Trump’s rationale for firing James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director saying he was dismissed because he would not say publicly what he had told the president privately: that Mr. Trump was not under scrutiny in the Russia investigation at the time.“He fired Comey because Comey would not among other things say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation” Mr. Giuliani said in an interview late Wednesday with Sean Hannity of Fox News. “He’s entitled to that.”Mr. Giuliani’s assertion contradicted the myriad explanations that the president and his aides have given for the firing and was the first public acknowledgment by a Trump adviser for what Mr. Comey has maintained: that he was fired for his handling of the Russia investigation.At the time of Mr. Comey’s dismissal last May both Mr. Trump and his aides cited his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and his decision to say publicly during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mrs. Clinton the Democratic candidate would not be charged with a crime.

 0,Lucent Technologies said yesterday that it was seeking to raise $1 billion through a private sale of securities in a deal that could provide a cushion for the company's creditors.Lucent the maker of communications equipment said proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock would be used for general corporate purposes. The company is under pressure to come up with cash even though it has recently reached agreements to sell assets for more than $3.3 billion.''This sale of securities will strengthen our liquidity'' said Michelle Davidson a spokeswoman for Lucent which is based in Murray Hill N.J.Lucent said last week that it planned to take a charge against earnings of as much as $9 billion this quarter to cover investment losses and job cuts. In addition Lucent said it would delay by six months the planned spinoff of a chip-making operation Agere Systems that had been planned for September. Lucent could end up on shaky footing with creditors as a result of the charge.

 9,Federal prosecutors plan to bolster their racketeering case against John Gotti by presenting evidence that he authorized six murders besides the five murders charged in his trial court documents disclosed yesterday.In the documents the prosecutors said they would use the additional six murders as evidence to support the racketeering charge against Mr. Gotti who is charged with being the boss of the Gambino crime family.Opening statements in the trial of Mr. Gotti and his co-defendant Frank Locascio are expected next week after jury selection is completed for the case in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.The court documents which involve a defense motion to exclude information about the six additional murders as prejudicial did not indicate where the prosecution obtained the latest information. But it is believed to have come from Salvatore Gravano originally a defendant regarded as Mr. Gotti's most trusted associate who turned informer.

 9,''We were clearing out they were boxing out Billy and Herb'' Ellison said of the play.He saw the shot was going to fall well short. ''I might have been the only one to see it'' said Ellison ''because nobody jumped but me.''Louisville then completed its finishing run a 17-8 surge. The Cardinals used strong rebounding - they grabbed 22 to Duke's 10 in the second half - to overcome their 24 turnovers for the game. They also had seven blocked shots; Duke had none.''We just pulled together like we normally do in the stretch'' said Thompson who scored 8 of his 13 points in the second half. Crook finished with 10 points as Louisville which shot 54 percent in the first half and 61 percent in the second.Meanwhile Duke which shot 41 percent in the first half and still lead by 37-34 slipped to 39 percent in the second in great part because the Cardinal defense shut down Dawkins.Denny Crum the Louisville coach who watched Dawkins score 15 points in the first half and 7 straight early in the second half put Jeff Hall a 6-5 senior on the all-America guard.After Dawkins hit a jumper with 15:27 left to give Duke a 48-42 lead he never made another field goal. He went scoreless until only 3:08 remained when he hit two free throws that gave Duke its final lead at 65-64.''He's so dangerous when he gets the ball so I just wanted to keep him from getting the ball'' Hall said of Dawkins who led Duke with 24.

 9,Brooklyn's Brownsville section which has been a synonym for urban decay has produced an innovative effort to renew housing in the Nehemiah Plan.The effort cited as a model for a provision of a housing bill passed yesterday by the United States Senate has replaced an area of devastation with 700 new brick row houses for owners with low and moderate incomes. Another 250 are under construction and the city is clearing land in neighboring East New York for construction of 1000 units by the same sponsor.''It was an idea whose time had come'' said Stephen Roberson an oragnizer for the East Brooklyn Churches the interdenominational coalition of 55 churches that financed and sponsored the construction. ''People who were previously locked out of owning equity in this economy now have a piece of the pie.'''The Nehemiah Plan began after the church coalition amassed an $8 million revolving fund to finance construction. Large loans came from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn the Episcopal Church and the Lutheran Church's Missouri Synod. The local congregations taxed themselves at the rate of $12 a year for each family.

 9,WHILE THE frozen streets here glistened with new-fallen snow the entrances to galleries and museums were aglitter with the same curvilinear glass vase filled with tulips. More than a harbinger of spring the recurring vase evoked the spirit of its designer Alvar Aalto whose centenary this year is the cause for the festive mood in this capital city.Though Aalto is the best known internationally he was only one of many Finnish designers and architects whose works defined this country's Modernist sensibility. Streamlined practical and durable these designs are familiar in homes and offices all over the world. In addition to the Aalto vase there are the ergonomically perfect Fiskars scissors the Everyboy striped shirt made by Marimekko and the red enamel coffeepot designed by Antti Nurmesniemi.The centerpiece of the recent events here is the reopening after a major interior renovation of the Museum of Art and Design along with a new permanent display that chronicles the history of Finnish modern design. Situated in a Gothic-revival school building the museum which opened in 1873 is the oldest in Scandinavia devoted to design. Its stores have grown rich enough not only to fill its own sleek showcases but also to make generous loans to the Bard Graduate Center in New York for its current exhibition ''Finnish Design: Utopian Ideals and Everyday Realities 1930 to 1997.'' This show of 144 works was organized by Marianne Aav curator of the Finnish museum and her counterpart at Bard Nina Stritzler-Levine.To appreciate the evolution of Finnish design one has to understand the history of the country. From the 12th century on Finland was under the dominion of Sweden until it was conquered by Russia in 1809. Finnish architecture began to flourish under the czars and with its pale-ocher columned buildings Helsinki took on the neo-classical style that made it the equal of St. Petersburg. When Finland became independent after the Russian Revolution in 1917 its designers already leaders at international expositions turned from a romantic tradition and used their work to assert a new identity. And in time Finland tied its economic future to a strong domestic industry in the design of modern products.

 0,Mark Bittman on food and all things related.For decades Americans believed that we had the world’s healthiest and safest diet . We worried little about this diet’s effect on the environment or on the lives of the animals (or even the workers) it relies upon. Nor did we worry about its ability to endure — that is its sustainability.That didn’t mean all was well. And we’ve come to recognize that our diet is unhealthful and unsafe. Many food production workers labor in difficult even deplorable conditions and animals are produced as if they were widgets. It would be hard to devise a more wasteful damaging unsustainable system.Here are some ideas — frequently discussed but sadly not yet implemented — that would make the growing preparation and consumption of food healthier saner more productive less damaging and more enduring. In no particular order:End government subsidies to processed food. We grow more corn for livestock and cars than for humans and it’s subsidized by more than $3 billion annually; most of it is processed beyond recognition. The story is similar for other crops including soy: 98 percent of soybean meal becomes livestock feed while most soybean oil is used in processed foods. Meanwhile the marketers of the junk food made from these crops receive tax write-offs for the costs of promoting their wares. Total agricultural subsidies in 2009 were around $16 billion which would pay for a great many of the ideas that follow.Begin subsidies to those who produce and sell actual food for direct consumption. Small farmers and their employees need to make living wages. Markets — from super- to farmers’ — should be supported when they open in so-called food deserts and when they focus on real food rather than junk food. And of course we should immediately increase subsidies for school lunches so we can feed our youth more real food.Break up the U.S. Department of Agriculture and empower the Food and Drug Administration . Currently the U.S.D.A. counts among its missions both expanding markets for agricultural products (like corn and soy!) and providing nutrition education. These goals are at odds with each other; you can’t sell garbage while telling people not to eat it and we need an agency devoted to encouraging sane eating. Meanwhile the F.D.A. must be given expanded powers to ensure the safety of our food supply. (Food-related deaths are far more common than those resulting from terrorism yet the F.D.A.’s budget is about one-fifteenth that of Homeland Security.)Outlaw concentrated animal feeding operations and encourage the development of sustainable animal husbandry. The concentrated system degrades the environment directly and indirectly while torturing animals and producing tainted meat poultry eggs and more recently fish. Sustainable methods of producing meat for consumption exist. At the same time we must educate and encourage Americans to eat differently. It’s difficult to find a principled nutrition and health expert who doesn’t believe that a largely plant-based diet is the way to promote health and attack chronic diseases which are now bigger killers worldwide than communicable ones. Furthermore plant-based diets ease environmental stress including global warming .Encourage and subsidize home cooking. (Someday soon I’ll write about my idea for a new Civilian Cooking Corps.) When people cook their own food they make better choices. When families eat together they’re more stable. We should provide food education for children (a new form of home ec anyone?) cooking classes for anyone who wants them and even cooking assistance for those unable to cook for themselves.Tax the marketing and sale of unhealthful foods. Another budget booster. This isn’t nanny-state paternalism but an accepted role of government: public health. If you support seat-belt tobacco and alcohol laws sewer systems and traffic lights you should support legislation curbing the relentless marketing of soda and other foods that are hazardous to our health — including the sacred cheeseburger and fries.Related Mark Bittman’s Blog Read more from the columnist.Reduce waste and encourage recycling. The environmental stress incurred by unabsorbed fertilizer cannot be overestimated and has caused for example a 6000-square-mile dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico that is probably more damaging than the BP oil spill. And some estimates indicate that we waste half the food that’s grown. A careful look at ways to reduce waste and promote recycling is in order.Mandate truth in labeling. Nearly everything labeled “healthy” or “natural” is not. It’s probably too much to ask that “vitamin water” be called “sugar water with vitamins ” but that’s precisely what real truth in labeling would mean.Reinvest in research geared toward leading a global movement in sustainable agriculture combining technology and tradition to create a new and meaningful Green Revolution.I’ll expand on these issues (and more) in the future but the essential message is this: food and everything surrounding it is a crucial matter of personal and public health of national and global security. At stake is not only the health of humans but that of the earth.This column appeared in print on February 2 2011. It will appear in Opinionator regularly.

 9,He must have felt our eyes fixed firmly on his back because every time he turned around those same eyes attacked his chest. These were not the polite furtive glances of shy-away women; these were visual kicks in the pants table-banging glares from three children waiting for their birthday party to begin.Eventually it did begin or rather it continued complete with hot soup frypan bread and hot coffee - and three desserts because as in the rum-tippling times of Dylan Thomas's Auntie Hannah birthdays like that came only once a year.A few years ago Mrs. Fisher and I exchanged birthday gifts on the 27th of June extending the holiday further back than usual. She gave me a small wooden chest filled with coated almonds and wine vinegar made from fresh herbes de Provence steeped in good French white wine. I gave her a set of 60 petit four tins in five different patterns. Her reaction was underwhelming.''Oh dear more things to make'' she said. Then she reassured me that she would use them and send along the results. A year later however when I opened her birthday gift to me there were the tins never used untouched. I don't think she knew or maybe she did.In a sense her most fascinating birthday story has not yet happened. I heard the start of it a few weeks ago as we sat outside on her porch under the postcard-blue sky of the Sonoma wine country. From her high-backed wicker chair she pointed to the parched flaxen field stretching like an endless tatami mat all the way to the black-green mountains in the distance. For 16 years she explained on her birthday or very close to it a huge barn owl flew across that field and landed on the telephone pole a few hundred yards from the porch.''It was at least three feet high and it must have had a nine-foot wingspan'' she said. And it was definitely the same old owl year after year.Before her last birthday some people came over with a sad story. ''They said they were sorry'' she recalled ''but they'd found the owl or rather the skeleton of the owl on the ground. A coyote had got him they thought.'' Came her birthday and she was sitting on the same porch same chair looking out across the yellow-white hay when a much smaller owl -''Maybe the grandson'' she ventured - alighted on the pole.
 9,A man who was being guarded by a police officer when the officer was murdered testified yesterday that he had seen two of the four men accused in the killing fleeing the murder scene in Queens.The witness a former homeowner in South Jamaica who uses the single name Arjune appeared at an evidentiary hearing in State Supreme Court. He is expected to be a major witness at the first of two trials scheduled in the case. Jury selection for the first trial began Monday.The officer Edward Byrne a 22-year-old rookie was shot to death while guarding Mr. Arjune's house about 3:30 A.M. on Feb. 26. Three months earlier Mr. Arjune's house had been firebombed after he had reported drug dealings outside his property. Mr. Arjune 46 has since been relocated.Until he testified yesterday - at a hearing to determine the validity of the procedures through which he had identified one of the defendants Scott Cobb 25 - it was not known how much of the crime he saw. He said that after being awakened by the shots and looking out the window he saw Mr. Cobb behind the wheel of the getaway car and another defendant Todd Scott 20 standing near the car.

 0,New York will join four other states — New Jersey Illinois Maryland and Washington — in suing the federal government over the Bush administration’s decision to restrict states from expanding coverage through the federal State Children’s Health Insurance Program Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced this afternoon.In August the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new rules that would make it much harder if not impossible for about 19 states to extend coverage to children in middle-income families. Under the new rules states seeking waivers for a higher income ceiling would have to show that they have already enrolled 95 percent of children whose parents make less than twice the poverty level. Currently no state in the country meets that standard.Mr. Spitzer who has made expanding coverage to more children a priority of his administration said the new federal rules violated laws that give governors broad discretion in setting the income eligibility levels in their states. In late August he raised the prospect of a legal challenge.New York has sought to expand its program to cover children in families with incomes up to four times as much as the federal poverty level or $82600 for a family of four. The state’s current limit is 250 percent of the poverty level. Last month the Bush administration rejected the proposed expansion which would have covered 70000 uninsured youngsters. The decision was the first time that the new rules had been applied.The lawsuit will argue that the new rules conflict with the statute setting up the federal program and were issued without an opportunity for public comment. as required by law.In addition to the five states taking part in the lawsuit Arizona California and New Hampshire will submit supporting briefs New York State officials said.
 9,Following are excerpts from yesterday's ruling by Judge Denny Chin of Federal District Court allowing Khallid Abdul Muhammad to hold a youth rally in Harlem that he calls the Million Youth March (M.Y.M.):The city's desire to deny Muhammad and M.Y.M. a platform from which to speak is understandable. Many of their statements are bigoted hateful violent and frightening. The right to free speech however applies not only to politically correct statements but also to statements with which we may disagree and indeed abhor.At least as frightening as the rhetoric of Mr. Muhammad is the possibility of a society where freedom of speech is not respected and where the right to speak publicly can be denied on the basis of administrative whim personal dislike or disapproval of anticipated content. . . .On Last Year's RallyI cannot conclude that the violence occurred as a direct result of the inflammatory words uttered by Muhammad (and others) to the crowd. To the contrary one of the videotapes shows that at the time the conflict broke out Muhammad was telling the demonstrators to ''go home to [their] families'' to ''go in the word of love'' to ''go in the word of peace'' and that the crowd has already begun to disperse. . . .I am left with the disquieting impression that the rally was ending and that if the police had simply been patient and given the participants a few minutes to disperse the risk of violence would have been substantially reduced. The scenes of demonstrators throwing barricades and other objects are disturbing but also disturbing is the spectacle of dozens of police officers in riot gear moving in on the stage with a helicopter swooping overhead just moments after the rally was scheduled to end when the rally was indeed about to conclude. . . .
 9,Baron Marcel Bich whose inexpensive Bic disposable pens lighters and razors made him wealthy enough to sustain an 11-year quest for the America's Cup died on Monday in Paris. He was 79 and lived in suburban Neuilly-sur-Seine.After fixing up a leaky shed in Clichy a northern Paris suburb after World War II Baron Bich and a partner Edouard Buffard began turning out inexpensive penholders and pencil cases. Later he obtained the patent rights to a ball-point pen invented by a Hungarian Ladislas Biro and formed Societe Bic in 1953. (The baron's name and the pen's are pronounced beek in French.)The inexpensive pens proved irresistible to consumers beginning with the French. The corporation rapidly expanded with factories in many countries turning out billions of pens sold singly or by the carton. Later he produced disposable razors and lighters. Annual Sales of $1.1 BillionIn 1993 the Bic group reported worldwide sales of $1.1 billion and a profit of $70.5 million. In the United States the French parent is represented by the Bic Corporation based in Milford Conn. and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Societe Bic also owns the French fashion and perfume house Guy Laroche the stocking company Dim and the lingerie maker Rosy.

Ehud Barak remarked in Washington recently that "from a professional military standpoint as long as there is no peace we need every meter of the Golan Heights and also at a time of peace we had better stay on the Golan Heights."Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai head of Israel's northern command called the Golan "a quiet volcano" because Syria has "the power to change the situation from one of peace and quiet in a fairly short time . . .

 0,When Encyclopaedia Britannica announced last month that it was discontinuing its print editions after 244 years company executives noted that there were 4000 sets of the final 32-volume 2010 edition left in a warehouse the remnants of an old tradition.Less than three weeks later the bulk of them are gone.Eager buyers have rushed to snap up the last printed sets of the encyclopedias with only 1000 left to be sold said Jorge Cauz the president of Encyclopaedia Britannica a company based in Chicago.Before it announced the end of the print edition on March 13 Britannica was selling the encyclopedias at a languid pace of about 60 each week at a $1395 price tag. Since then it has sold about 1050 each week or 150 a day at the same price.That is in line with an average week’s sales for some of the periods when the company had a fully staffed sales force. The company expects the remaining 1000 sets to disappear by mid- to late April. (Sales of the print Encyclopaedia Britannica reached their peak in 1990 when 120000 sets were sold domestically.)The sales staff has been so overwhelmed by calls that Britannica’s chief marketing officer has been answering phones to help out.The encyclopedias which weigh 129 pounds a set are being bought mostly by individual consumers people who are calling Britannica and paying in full on their credit cards the company said.“When they thought it would be around forever there was no rush to buy one” Mr. Cauz said in an e-mail. “But now suddenly it’s a scarce item.”Print encyclopedias have been gradually edged out by online resources most recently Wikipedia the free crowd-sourced encyclopedia that was started 11 years ago.The Encyclopaedia Britannica was the oldest continuously published encyclopedia in the English language.

 0,Agnieszka Radwanska came into her third-round match-up with defending champion Maria Sharapova with a simple plan: “I’ve got nothing to lose so I just hit the ball.”She did. Sharapova didn’t. And just like that Radwanska the 30th seed here has become the toast of the tournament ousting the No. 2 seed in three sets. Asked how she’ll feel about seeing her face on the front page of every newspaper tomorrow the 18-year-old from Poland just smiled.“Good. Very good.”Although this was a monumental upset by any measure it wasn’t by any means a fluke despite the fact that Radwanska was until a few months ago as worried about graduating high school as she was about her professional career. After Radwanska passed her exams she was a rising star on the women’s tour having won in Stockholm and reaching the 3rd round at Wimbledon.As a junior Radwanska won the French Open in 2005 and Wimbledon in 2006.Today she showed great power (particularly off the forehand) stellar defense and that rarest of commodities: The ability to forget. After taking the first set 6-4 from Sharapova Radwanska was by her own admission “destroyed” in the second losing 6-1.“But then I woke up” she said and let Sharapova help her help herself. Over the course of the third set Sharapova missed on the forehand side missed on the backhand side and missed on her serve.“She helped me out a lot” Radwanska acknowledged.She also showed a sneaky streak creeping inside the baseline Michael Chang-style trying to draw the second serve error from Sharapova. In the seventh game it worked helping Radwanska to a 5-2 lead.“I knew she didn’t like if somebody is moving if she is serving so I was trying to do something like this” she said.Sharapova gave her opponent credit not just for that but for not wilting under the pressure.“A lot of girls in her position in a big stadium against a top player sometimes get a little nervous. She held on there and all the credit to her for winning the match” she said after the match.So what’s the first order of business for Radwanska now? She’ll pay off a bet she made with her sister.“If I beat her we will buy two Louis Vuitton bag” she said. After the match her sister came to the locker room. “Okay now we’re going to Louis Vuitton.”
 9,Between the time ''The Lemon Sisters'' was scheduled to open a year ago and its actual opening yesterday a story surfaced that this much worked-over film would be renamed so no one would make cheap remarks like ''It's a lemon.'' Relax; you won't hear any bad lemon jokes here. Just imagine Diane Keaton at her most hysterical as an asthmatic cat lover who returns from a stay in the hospital to find that her two best friends have thrown her a cat-free welcome-home party. ''Those cats need me!'' she yells. ''Those cats love me!'' You can make up your own lemon jokes.In addition to inviting bad puns ''The Lemon Sisters'' also inspires dazed disbelief that professional film makers could have made such an amateurish movie. This story of three lifelong friends begins with black-and-white scenes of the girls in Atlantic City their hometown in 1959. One lemon alone on a slot machine is nothing Nola's mother has told her ''but three is a jackpot.'' Nola says this in a long voiceover that explains the plot - always a sign of desperation. When these three little lemons suddenly reappear in 1982 Eloise has turned into Ms. Keaton and has inherited her father's small museum of television memorabilia. Nola (Kathryn Grody) is now a wife and mother struggling to keep her family's salt-water taffy business going. And Franki played by Carol Kane is determined to be a singer despite a conspicuous lack of talent. At least the film means to show that Franki is talentless the only embarrassment it intends.Otherwise ''The Lemon Sisters'' assumes things it ought to prove like: why are these women still friends except for old loyalty and shared vapidity? Yet the film constantly reminds us of the most obvious facts. In case you didn't know that Atlantic City has many casinos there is a helpful long montage of casino signs.There are two good scenes in ''The Lemon Sisters.'' In one the friends sing ''Stop in the Name of Love'' complete with stop-sign hand gestures; here is the mocking humor the film desperately needs. In the other Ms. Kane explains that she was named after Frank Sinatra. Remarkably she manages to make her character appealing. It must have been a lonely job.

 9,Finally college officials say anything that competes with binge drinking the current plague of college campuses should be encouraged.''I see it as a kind of continuation of kids' soccer leagues increasingly structured social interaction'' said Craig W. Bradley dean of student affairs at Bowdoin College in Maine which is also experiencing a surge in ballroom and swing dancing.''During the first year in college it is so important to feel like you belong have a group'' Mr. Bradley said. ''If it isn't happening drinking fills that void. The conventions around dating fell away in recent decades. I have students come in and say they want intimate relations but don't know how to get there. Ballroom dancing is one answer.''The trend also seems to be a middle-class revenge against the formlessness of popular dance that began in the early 1960's when Chubby Checker's twist sent partner dancing packing. Dancing for milleniums a form of social glue deteriorated in the 1960's into group chaos against a background of loud pulsating rhythms and nervous two-step hugging to slower songs.As Laura Kelso an 18-year-old Penn State freshman from Greensburg Pa. put it in describing her interest in the new swing dance club here ''Dancing in high school was either flailing around or slow dances without steps. People need some kind of structure some form of socialization.''In the Penn State ballroom dance classes held in several large gymnasiums with pale green walls exposed pipes and worn wooden floors that is precisely what may be observed. There are no smart-alecks here said Elizabeth A. Hanley the teacher with nearly four decades of experience. Here are tomorrow's stalwarts in all forms the smoothly decorous the knobby-jointed and the floppy-footed content to be addressed as ''ladies and gentlemen.''''It is always good to know how to dance'' said Jeffrey Ellis a rangy 22-year-old from Pittsburgh just finishing an accounting degree.

 0,Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work.Carolyn SilveiraBig institutions are often slow to awaken to major social transformations. Microsoft was famously late to grasp the importance of the Internet. American auto manufacturers were slow to identify the demand for fuel-efficient cars. And today the United States government is making a similar mistake: it still doesn’t seem to recognize that Americans no longer work the way they used to.Today some 42 million people — about a third of the United States work force — do not have jobs in the traditional sense. They fall into a catchall category the government calls “contingent” workers. These people — independent contractors freelancers temp workers part-timers people between jobs — typically work on a project-to-project basis for a variety of clients and most are outcasts from the traditional system of benefits that provide economic security to Americans. Even as the economy has changed employment benefits are still based on an outdated industrial-era model in which workers are expected to stay with a single company for years if not their whole careers.The industrial-era model of employer-based health care no longer applies.For most of the 20th century it was efficient to link benefits to jobs this way. But today more and more work falls outside the one-to-one employee-to-employer relationship. Work is decentralized workers are mobile and working arrangements are fluid. However the risks of life haven’t gone away: people still need protections. They just need a different system to distribute them. They need benefits that they can carry around like their laptops. As things stand millions of independent workers go without health and unemployment insurance protection against discrimination and unpaid wages and pension plans. It makes no sense.One of the social innovators to recognize this problem early and act on it was Sara Horowitz the founder of the Freelancers Union which has more than 165000 members across all 50 states. At Fixes we highlight practical applications of ideas that have the potential to achieve widespread impact. That means looking at how ideas take root in institutions that become part of the fabric of society.In the early 20th century a landscape of new institutions — including the early labor unions and hundreds of civil society organizations like Rotary International the Boy and Girl Scouts and the N.A.A.C.P. — reshaped the American landscape. Today the Freelancers Union offers a glimpse of the kind of social enterprise — mission-driven and pragmatic market-savvy and cooperative — that is likely to proliferate in the coming years to meet the needs of a fast-changing work force and society.Horowitz had been a labor lawyer and union organizer when in the early 1990s she recognized that the number of people turning to independent work was on the rise. It was also clear that institutions had not yet been built to represent them in any meaningful way. (On one occasion Horowitz found herself misclassified by an employer as an independent contractor — and quickly discovered that she received no job benefits.) Horowitz had the idea to create an organization to bring freelancers together so they could wield their power in the marketplace and in the political arena much like AARP does for retirees.She quickly discovered that their biggest concern was the cost of health insurance. But there were other problems too. Unlike traditional workers who receive unemployment benefits independent contractors have to rely on their own resources to get through hard times. In 2009 Freelancers Union surveyed 3000 members and found that more than 80 percent had gone jobless or underemployed during the year. More than 60 percent had used their credit cards or borrowed from friends and family to make ends meet and 12 percent had to turn to food stamps. Close to 40 percent had given up or downgraded their health insurance protection.Another problem was getting paid. Some companies like Time Inc. actually charge freelancers penalties if they request payment within 25 days. Freelancers Union found that 77 percent of its members had been cheated by a client during their careers and 40 percent had had trouble getting paid in 2009. The average wage loss was $6000. The Department of Labor protects traditional workers from unpaid wages but freelancers have no equivalent recourse. Then there were difficulties obtaining mortgages the lack of access to 401(k) plans and other issues.An insurance provider that stays viable by not seeking to maximize profits.Horowitz saw that she could attract a large membership if she could figure out how to provide health insurance at lower cost. Health insurance companies don’t have much love for freelancers. They prefer to serve large groups because it’s easier to deal with one corporate benefits manager than a multitude of individuals. And because insurers often lack reliable information about independent workers they tend to assume that they are risky. As a result premiums in the open marketplace for health insurance are higher and more volatile than those for employees. (The Affordable Care Act is designed to address this problem beginning in 2014 by subsidizing private insurance but it applies only to people with low and moderate incomes.)Horowitz got the idea of grouping freelancers in New York State so they could purchase their health insurance together. It made sense in theory but it had never been done. She worked closely with officials in Albany notably Assemblyman Sheldon Silver who was a strong ally and Gregory Serio the former superintendent of insurance for New York State who had the authority to grant approval for “discretionary” insurance groups.“A lot of health insurers have looked at individual and sole proprietors as very expensive and risky to underwrite” explained Serio. “Sara was able to foresee a trend [in the rise of independent work] before a lot of other people did. She went and found out that these people were not bad risks. Her creativity was in using existing concepts of insurance risk sharing and applying it to a community that has been ignored by the marketplace and in fact almost vilified by the marketplace.”Serio and Horowitz made an interesting team. “I was a conservative Republican from Nassau County working for George Pataki” he told me. “And she was my liberal friend from Brooklyn.” But Serio found the idea of protecting freelancers appealing because his father had been a dentist who operated out of a second-floor walk-up office on Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven Queens. “I grew up in a sole proprietor household” he said. “If my father didn’t work he didn’t get paid. And I knew what it was like seeing health insurance rates go up and up.”Today the Freelancers Insurance Company (F.I.C.) which is wholly owned by the Freelancers Union (a nonprofit) has revenues of roughly $100 million and covers 25000 independent workers and their family members in New York State offering them premiums that the company calculates are more than a third below the open market rate. Close to 60 percent of its clients were previously uninsured or on COBRA (a temporary extension of their previous insurance). The renewal rate last year was 97 percent. (Disclosure: I have purchased health insurance from F.I.C. for a number of years.) The company was financed with $17 million in loans and grants from social investors including the Rockefeller Foundation the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the New York City Investment Fund. “Our freelancers have access to the best doctors and hospitals” says Horowitz. “We have skilled human resource people just like Fortune 500 companies. We’re able to watch out for our members.”How can the F.I.C. undercut market rates and still be a viable enterprise? The key is that while it seeks to be profitable it does not seek to maximize profits. Its executives receive salaries that are below industry averages and it has only one shareholder (the Freelancers Union) to satisfy. Those are fundamental differences. Silver who is the speaker of the State Assembly notes that the success of the F.I.C. makes it more difficult for traditional insurers to contend that they can’t deliver insurance at lower cost. “Duplicating the model and showing the ability of [the F.I.C.] to keep costs under control is something that we will be looking at” he adds.Like many social goods health insurance is often seen through a binary lens: either it must be handled by the government or it must be handled by the free market. But the F.I.C. is demonstrating that a middle way can work too and that it may be preferable to provide vital services like insurance through social-benefit companies at least to certain customer groups. In fact the Affordable Care Act has a provision to finance a new type of nonprofit health insurance company that would be run by its customers. It would be called a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP). The Freelancers Union has proposed to establish CO-OPs in Florida New Jersey New York Oregon and Washington.Because the F.I.C. has a close connection with freelancers it can be more effective helping its members make good health care decisions. “We’re moving away from fee-for-service medicine to one where a primary care doctor aggressively coordinates care” explains Horowitz. “We’re also trying to innovate with alternative care — promoting meditation yoga and nutrition which can have long-term beneficial effects.” In 2012 the organization will be opening up the Brooklyn Freelancers Medical Practice a health center modeled on the medical-home approach and designed in partnership with a physician named Rushika Fernandopulle who pioneered a team-based model of care that is attracting attention across the country.For now the United States government doesn’t keep an accurate count of the independent work force. This is an oversight. It appears likely that this way of working will continue to grow. In cities with concentrations of knowledge workers you find a proliferation of co-working spaces designed specifically for freelancers. And online marketplaces for freelancers like Etsy oDesk and Elance are expanding rapidly.Related More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series.It’s not just hipsters who work like this. Forty-five percent of Freelancers Union members are over 40 years old. Not all follow this path by choice. Many freelancers are former employees like journalists who lost jobs. Recent college graduates discovering that a degree is far from a job guarantee are forced to be more entrepreneurial. And many companies seeking to hold costs down engage freelancers rather than hire full-time workers. All of these workers deserve the same protections accorded to others.“The industrial workers of the 20th century helped bring about the New Deal” says Horowitz. “But the New Deal hasn’t evolved to include independent workers. I think this work force will help bring about the next New Deal — a framework of economic security that is parallel in its goals but led by a network of new institutions.”“The government can’t replace civil society” she added. “So if the civil society organizations have control it will be harder to have your benefits taken away — if you happen to lose an election.”On Wednesday I’ll report on some of the other ways the Freelancers Union is helping to make independent work more secure. In the meantime if you are a freelancer or know someone who works this way let us know about your experiences.Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.David Bornstein is the author of “How to Change the World” which has been published in 20 languages and “The Price of a Dream: The Story of the Grameen Bank” and is co-author of “Social Entrepreneurship: What Everyone Needs to Know.” He is the founder of dowser.org a media site that reports on social innovation.

 9,The Canadians he said persuaded him to discontinue a Spartan-like existence in prison by bringing him delicacies including Chateaubriand and by decorating his cell with oriental rugs flowers plants and prints of paintings by Monet and Gauguin.''It was no longer a cell but a free man's home'' Mr. Carter explained.In an interview one of the Canadians who asked that his name be withheld said he and his wife had become the guardians of a black teen-age boy from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn in the late 1970's. He said the youth while living with them in Ontario and while researching the history of black Americans read Mr. Carter's autobiography ''The 16th Round'' published by Viking Press in 1974. The book gave an account of Mr. Carter's arrest and first conviction in 1967.The Canadian couple the youth and other Canadian friends became so intrigued by Mr. Carter's plight that they visited him frequently in Trenton State Prison and are helping him financially. A Ballad and Applause''We were extremely moved and impressed that Rubin was able to maintain his dignity strength and sensitivity'' said the Canadian who would identify himself only as a businessman.Lawyers for Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis said the Canadians had obtained transcripts of the trial records and court documents and had provided valuable research help.While in prison Mr. Carter spoke out often about his case. But he went into seclusion in November 1985 after a Federal District Judge H. Lee Sarokin overturned the second convictions of Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis and released Mr. Carter without bail. Mr. Artis had been released in 1981.Judge Sarokin ruled that a 1976 jury verdict had been ''infected'' by racial bias and that the prosecution withheld evidence that could have aided the defense.
 0,A design featuring two stainless-steel walls that look from a certain perspective as if the World Trade Center towers had been neatly felled and had landed in New Jersey has won the competition for New Jersey's Sept. 11 memorial Gov. James E. McGreevey announced yesterday. The winning proposal came from the Manhattan-based architect Frederic Schwartz.The design for the memorial which is to be built directly across the Hudson River from ground zero at Liberty State Park in Jersey City was the unanimous choice of a panel that represented the families of the nearly 700 New Jersey victims of the Sept. 11 attacks officials said.Mr. Schwartz's memorial ''Empty Sky'' is reminiscent of Maya Lin's Vietnam War memorial in Washington. It has two facing walls of brushed stainless steel with the names of each New Jersey victim engraved on them. As Mr. Schwartz's firm put it: ''Individuals' names are within easy reach and engraved deep enough for hand rubbing. The lettering size is three and three-quarter inches high in Times New Roman a familiar and easy-to-read typeface.''Each wall will be 30 feet high and 200 feet long as long as each World Trade Center tower was wide. The walls' proportions will be the same as those of the twin towers if they were lying on their sides. And the surfaces of the steel walls will reflect the changing light of day as the towers once did. At night the memorial will be illuminated so beams of light shoot into the sky.

 9,Miss Musgrave knows how to set the English language infinitely better than most of her colleagues. Never is the natural accent of words wrenched askew; never is the natural flow interrupted. She also is enough of a traditionalist to work within established operatic conventions and “The Voice of Ariadne” is built around solo duet and other set pieces.The libretto too is extremely intelligent. It has been adapted by Amalia Elguera from a Henry James Story “The Last of the Valerii.” Naturally James being involved there are all kinds of relationships. But basically the story tells about a Count infatuated with the Ariadne legend. He alone can hear her voice and he falls in love. At the end his wife takes on Ariadne and conquers.This is a bald synopsis of a very literate libretto one that is capable of being interpreted on many levels. Nothing much really happens; there is no violent action or indeed much action of any kind. Yet the character development is so strong that the story holds the attention. And the entire production strives for a period quality that transcends the period. The sets and costumes by Carl Toms are naturalistic handsome and rich‐looking and Colin Graham's direction points everything toward the denouement. For once in Henry James an American can meet the European aristocracy on even terms.Miss Musgrave's music uses a small orchestra has taped sections—Ariadne is never seen only her voice on tape heard—has a good deal of aleatory and plenty of dissonance. Yet it anything but avant‐garde. Miss Musgrave constantly tries for melody.Whether she succeeds is another question. She still writes in a style that sounds very old‐fashioned with oll those seconds and ninths. She favors a type of melodic declamation and even the big numbers where she wants to get a soaring line manage to sound tight and constricted. Basically her resources are very limited. Textures sound monotonous after a while and the musical materials are just not very interesting. What Miss Musgrave does she does with integrity but this is still. another opera that does not “sing.”

 0,Until Wednesday night Donald Trump and people in his orbit insisted that the president had known nothing about the $130000 hush money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels made by his lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen days before the 2016 election. Last month on Air Force One a reporter asked Trump about it directly: “Did you know about the $130000 payment to Stormy Daniels?” His response was a categorical no.This denial was always implausible and now we have new evidence that Trump was lying. On Wednesday evening Rudy Giuliani whose appointment to Trump’s legal team was announced two weeks ago appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and casually admitted that Trump had repaid Cohen for the money he gave to Daniels “over a period of several months.”This was a bombshell. And in the 12 hours that followed both Trump and Giuliani made a series of statements so seemingly self-sabotaging and undisciplined that observers began searching for some sort of hidden strategy or logic. Were they trying to get out ahead of a coming revelation? To set off a metaphorical smoke bomb that would distract from some other scandalous development? Or were they really as blundering and incompetent as they appeared?I suspect the answer is a combination of the three. But their motivations are less important than the information they’ve provided us. Whether they realize it or not experts say they appear to have admitted that Trump and Cohen broke the law. The question is whether the impunity that Trump has enjoyed so far will hold or whether this farce of a presidency will at long last begin to crumble under the weight of its own sleaze.

 9,To the Editor:Your news article ''20-Year Low in City Fires Posted in '84'' (March 2) quoted a number of theories regarding the dramatic downturn in fire activity including the commonly heard ''There is nothing left to burn.'' I for one consider such a cynical hypothesis to be singularly uninformed.To suggest that arson merely burned itself out overlooks the city's coordinated antiarson efforts which have since the formation of the Arson Strike Force by the Mayor and City Council in 1978 reduced incendiary fires in vacant structures to the lowest level in more than 27 years.Two major programs in controlling arson in vacant buildings are particularly important. The Fire Department's Red Cap Program established in 1981 keeps vandals out of vacant buildings through saturated patrol strategies. The Seal Up and Demolition Program of Housing Preservation and Development is responsible for demolishing over 12000 empty buildings and sealing 31000 more buildings (8000 masonary and 23000 tin) in the last seven years virtually removing the opportunity for vandals to set fires in such arson-prone structures.Thus the ''nothing left to burn'' theory like most simplistic answers offered in response to complex problems has one fatal flaw: it is simply not true.

 0,Paul Blart’s reign at the top of the box office came to an end over the weekend toppled by the vigilante-father film “Taken” starring Liam Neeson. That action movie about a former C.I.A. operative on a mission to rescue his daughter from kidnappers in Paris earned $24.6 million for 20th Century Fox in its first week in theaters more than enough to push “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (Columbia) into second place according to the box office tracking firm Media by Numbers. “Paul Blart” a comedy starring Kevin James as a formidable shopping mall security force earned $13.9 million for a cumulative total of $83.3 million in three weeks. Paramount Pictures took the third and fourth spots: “Uninvited” a horror movie starring David Strathairn and Elizabeth Banks made $10.5 million in its first weekend and “Hotel for Dogs” the adaptation of Lois Duncan’s 1971 story about children who save stray animals made $8.706 million ($48.2 million to date). “Hotel” barely edged out Clint Eastwood’s “Gran Torino” which earned $8.7 million for Warner Brothers ($110.6 million to date).
 0,“Eden as We Recall” a delicate work by Stacy Spence is a dance about space: What does a room feel like? What influence does the environment have on the body? At Danspace Project where the piece was performed as part of its Platform 2012: Judson Now series Mr. Spence excavated St. Mark’s Church with his movement and with his eyes.Elements were arranged on the stage with deliberation. A screen showed an image of two doorways side by side. Audio equipment sat on the floor near four white benches that lined the area directly in front of the audience. On one side of the benches were spools of white and orange string masking tape keys and paper; on the other Mr. Spence sat with his back to us.PhotoEven before the dance started Mr. Spence’s barely-there movements — crossing a leg adjusting the position of an upturned palm shifting the weight of a hip — were unmistakable. It helped that the lighting design by Carol Mullins kept the space perpetually bright and that Mr. Spence is all skin and bones. A longtime member of the Trisha Brown Dance Company he can shift from brittle to fluid at a moment’s notice.Of Mr. Spence’s collaborators the sound artist Tei Blow and the dancer Brandi Norton (another Trisha Brown alum) Mr. Blow is the more compelling. Using a microphone and a recording device he created a score by plucking string ripping paper or brushing the microphone along Mr. Spence’s body and then playing it back. “Eden as We Recall” which most likely refers to Eden’s Expressway the scrappy SoHo studio where the piece was first conceived becomes as much about sound as about space.The details you normally gloss over — the way a wall juts out or ordinary background noise — are brought to the forefront in “Eden.” Mr. Spence caressed the air as if he were touching objects even when there was nothing there but he also moved brashly whipping into a sudden attitude turn with a raised bent knee or flinging himself into the air with outstretched arms.Still as compelling as Mr. Spence is — and such advanced articulation of the body is always weirdly titillating — “Eden” has its fair share of dullness. Ms. Norton’s appearance midway through came like an afterthought. At its heart “Eden” is a sensory trip for two.

 9,Even before the Soviet Union officially comes aboard the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are preparing technical assistance and training for the huge job of transforming the Soviet economy from a centrally planned one to a market system.The giant lending organizations are also sliding toward a normal relationship with China. China has been a member of the organizations for 10 years but after repressing the student-led democracy movement in Beijing last year it was hit by sanctions that included a halt to international loans.Integrating the SystemThe moves signaled at the joint annual meeting of the institutions last week would help integrate the two largest countries into the world economic system and further establish the 45-year-old organizations at the center of the system's management.''In the long term it's certainly desirable to reach out to all countries that matter'' said Prof. Richard J.

 0,Carl Banks was a hard-hitting All-Pro linebacker for Giants teams that won two Super Bowls. Off the field he was one of the best-dressed athletes around town. Banks who retired as a player in 1995 is an analyst on Giants radio broadcasts a commentator on WFAN and a host on Sirius Radio. He recently started an apparel line with N.F.L. team logos for Lord & Taylor stores.Q.How did you become interested in designing clothes?A.A. I always loved fashion. Playing in New York I always enjoyed Madison Avenue and looking in windows of stores like Barneys. I was one of the first athletes to endorse Starter the sports fashion company started by David Beckerman. He was my mentor and hero. He took the culture of sports and fused it into fashion.Q.How long have you been involved in the clothing business?A.I put together my first sample line back in 1988 showed it around and received a great response. I was granted a limited license from the National Football League at that time. Since then it has grown into something full scale G-III Sports by Carl Banks.Q.What aspects of the line do you oversee?A.Every phase. I have a full staff but I still do the designing. I’m involved from concept to production to marketing. From mind to market.Q.What clothes designed by other companies do you like?A.Prps because I’m a denim snob. I like G-Star; it’s a fun brand for me. And I’m very fond of Joseph Abboud and I’m a fan of his work. He used to let me sit in on some of his design meetings. His process is so wonderful.Q.You were recently featured with your line on the Home Shopping Network. How did you do on a station that has had Susan Lucci Paula Abdul and Tori Spelling selling their wares?A.Pretty good. I sold about 32000 retro hoodies in a 22-hour span.Q.Did you feel slighted that you were not included in the Giants’ Ring of Honor at New Meadowlands Stadium?A.I didn’t spend much time on it. The Giants have a legacy of great players. I know without a doubt that my contributions have always been greatly appreciated by the organization. In due time if there’s another opportunity I’m sure they’ll consider it. But I didn’t feel slighted. If it doesn’t happen I know the organization appreciates my contribution to its success.Q.Will there be a lockout in the N.F.L. next season?A.I think it will be the dumbest thing to happen if the players and their union can’t find a way to work this out. There’s so much at stake. If it happens football will recover but I don’t know if the players will recover. Businesses will be hurt mine included. There is so much prosperity in the league now there is a healthy compromise in there somewhere. It’s a league of haves and have-nots. The guys with the $20 million signing bonuses will be O.K. But the guys who have short careers — the average life span of a pro football player is 3.4 years — there are a lot of those guys who just can’t withstand a lockout.Q.What players do you enjoy watching?A.I like the 49ers’ Patrick Willis a lot. I think he’s one fine linebacker. I love watching the Pittsburgh Steelers play football. Ahmad Bradshaw is just an exciting football player. He can make something out of nothing. He’s an explosive runner. And I like watching Tom Brady play.
 9,Mr. Chaves was about to enter his junior year at William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City. He worked on weekends and during the summer with his father Lope an Ecuadorean immigrant who is an independent contractor installing doors and windows. Mr. Chaves does not have a criminal record and was described by neighbors as a quiet respectful boy.Mr. Woods testified that at the time of the slaying he was 5-foot-6 and weighed 145 pounds. He denied under questioning by an assistant district attorney James Quinn that he ever told the police at his arrest that he was 165 pounds. Mr. Quinn had him remove the jacket of his three-piece suit to show a muscular upper body. Mr. Chaves said he has been weight lifting and is now 5-foot-9 and weighs 165 pounds.Mr. Chaves testified he was standing with five friends when he saw about 10 youths approaching. They included Mr. Woods and a girl - the sister of another girl who had been slapped in a fracas with some youths and Mr. Chaves and some of his companions on Aug. 27. He testified that at least two of the approaching youths were carrying hockey sticks.Mr. Chaves who claimed he never struck a girl said ''This guy David jumped over the bushes.'' He recalled Mr. Woods saying 'Who's the tough guy who hit the girl?' Before I knew it he hit me.'' Another Punch in the FaceMr. Chaves speaking in a barely audible voice put his head into his hands and began to cry. Justice Seymour Rotker as he would several times asked him if he could continue.Mr. Chaves said that as he recovered from the punch to his face he saw another youth approaching from his side with something in his hands and Mr. Woods punched him the face again he said.Prosecution witnesses testified that Mr. Woods never hit Mr. Chaves but defense witnesses said that he had.

 0,On Tuesday I moderated a panel at of all things the United Nations. It was pretty cool to sit down in a U.N. conference room complete with those little earpiece thingies for hearing translations (although no translators were on duty–rats).Anyway the panel was all about free and open-source software and how it might benefit the U.N.’s member states. The panelists included six advocates of free software–for example representatives from Novell I.B.M. and Red Hat all of whom have developed thriving consulting and support businesses around free software like Linux–and a Microsoft rep. He valiantly enunciated Microsoft’s current attitude toward the open-source movement: for example that Microsoft welcomes and has learned from the competition and that the market has plenty of room for both proprietary and free software.What made things especially interesting was that only two seats away from him was Richard Stallman the influential founder of the free software movement and a man who does not mince words.Mr. Stallman does not like Microsoft. Wow does he not. He mentioned that when the U.N. sent him the information about the panel in a Microsoft Word document he refused it and requested a different format. During the panel he called Microsoft evil said that the U.S. government is in Microsoft’s pocket and at one point faced the Microsoft guy and shouted right there in the United Nations conference room “You are a deceptive person!”A good time was had by all.Seriously though many countries (or departments within them) are already making the switch to open-source software. They save money up front because the software doesn’t cost anything but there are other motivations like security (they can inspect the source code) and in some countries the hope of generating jobs for local programmers and administrators.If you believe the companies who are offering open-source packages–and not everyone does–the momentum is clearly on the free-software side that the tide is turning and even that the days of the proprietary-software monopoly are numbered.As I mentioned at the end of the seminar: Let’s all meet back here in ten years and see how things turned out.
 9,But there are also indications that the scandal reaches far beyond the Dominican Republic. Traditionally the numbers drawn here each week also serve as winners for a private lottery in neighboring Haiti and for illegal lotteries that operate in Venezuela Curacao and also among some of the million or so Dominican immigrants estimated to be living in the New York metropolitan region.Dominican Government officials said the ring had agents in all those locations who were given winning numbers in advance. In New York City the agents placed wagers in dollars on those numbers at Dominican-owned bodegas throughout Manhattan and the Bronx but often encountered resistance when they went to collect winnings from store owners suspicious of their repeated good fortune.''It is clear that some bodegas in New York City were burned down as a result of the refusal of their owners to pay up probably by police officers sent up there to collect'' said a Dominican Government official involved in the investigation who insisted on anonymity. ''We also have reason to suspect that several people were killed in New York City for refusing to pay off and we are going to be talking to the American authorities about that.''Nine people have been arrested among them Frederick Marzouka a Haitian businessman who said on Ms. Piera's program that he had been a ''bagman'' for the ring keeping a 30 percent cut of the winning bets that he placed. Also charged is Col. Manuel Cruz Madera an aide to the former Chief of the National Police Gen. Camilo Nazir Tejada who was replaced last year for undisclosed reasons after the first allegations of irregularities had surfaced.''There are a lot of authorities involved in this mess'' Mr. Marzouka said in a television interview in which he displayed an identification card signed by ''my good friend'' General Nazir Tejada that designated Mr. Marzouka as an agent of the ''secret service'' of the Dominican police. ''They were using me as a front and now I'm the scapegoat.''Not long after his arrest Mr. Marzouka escaped from a medical clinic where he was being detained and fled to the United States which led to the firing of the director of the national prison system Bernardo Santana Paez. Dominican officials said that Mr. Marzouka had been living in the Miami region and that an extradition request had been filed.In an effort to restore public confidence President Fernandez appointed Taina Gautreau de Windt as the new lottery director in March rewarding her for her effort to clean up the Dominican immigration service. In an interview Ms. Gautreau said the Government had taken ''a series of corrective measures'' aimed at ''rescuing the credibility and transparency'' of the lottery.

The statement said Carol Gotbaum had been “manhandled” and mistreated sentiments that the family’s lawyer echoed in an interview.“The family has not reached a conclusion as to whether her care and treatment were inappropriate but the circumstances were highly unusual” Michael C. Manning a lawyer who was hired on Sunday by the Gotbaum family told The New York Times in a phone interview. “This woman — who was 5-foot-7 less than 110 pounds — was without doubt emotionally disturbed and at this stage the family understands why the Phoenix Police Department intervened but it’s what happened after the intervention that causes us concern.”Mr. Manning said that the Maricopa County medical examiner’s office had initially scheduled an autopsy for today but that at his request the office had agreed to delay the autopsy by a day. Mr. Manning also said that he wanted an independent forensic pathologist to be present during the autopsy.According to the Phoenix police Carol Gotbaum became agitated and disruptive at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Friday after missing a 2:58 p.m. U.S. Airways Express flight to Tucson. Sgt. Andy Hill a police spokesman told CNN this morning:We did receive a call that she was very loud – yelling and screaming running around the concourse area. Two officers responded to that location. They contacted Ms. Gotbaum. They could not calm her down. There was probable cause to arrest her for disorderly conduct by disturbing the peace which they did. It was very difficult for them to get her handcuffed but they did not have to pepper-spray or Tase her or anything else.One of the officers then took Ms. Gotbaum to a holding office where about seven other police employees were working Sergeant Hill said. She was placed in a holding room with her hands cuffed behind her back he said.Sergeant Hill said that police procedure calls for checking on detainees at least once every 15 minutes. After Ms. Gotbaum had been in the room 5 to 10 minutes — and stopped screaming — officers who went to check on her found her unconscious with her cuffed hands close to her neck. The officers tried to use an automated external defibrillator and then cardiopulmonary resuscitation to revive her but were not successful. Members of the local Fire Department arrived; they too could not revive her.At 4:03 p.m. Eastern standard time Sergeant Hill issued a statement containing additional details about the death:When Ms. Gotbaum was arrested and handcuffed with her hands behind her back she was taken to the holding office in Terminal 4 and placed in a holding room. There she was searched but was continuing to be vocally and physically disruptive in the holding room. Ms. Gotbaum was additionally restrained as follows: In the holding room there is a bench with an “eyehook” attached to it. The officers took a “shackle” which is described as a metal chain approximately 16 inches long with a large “handcuff” on each side. The total length of the chain with handcuffs is approximately 24 inches. One of the handcuffs on the “shackle” was attached to the “eyehook” on the bench. The other handcuff of the shackle was attached to the chain of the handcuffs that were already on Ms. Gotbaum’s hands. So Ms. Gotbaum was handcuffed with her hands behind her back and additionally those handcuffs were attached to a shackle that kept her attached to the bench. This is the best we can describe the situation at that point. All of the previous information is still the same with the addition of the information of the shackle. We still do not know how Ms. Gotbaum was able to manipulate the handcuffs to the position she was in. But when she was found her handcuffs were in front and the shackle was still attached to her handcuffs. The chain was not wrapped around her neck. It was pulled against the front of her neck area. I hope this helps. Again the Phoenix Police Department is conducting a death investigation. The Medical Examiner’s Office will determine cause and manner of death. And the Phoenix Police Department Professional Standards Bureau is conducting an internal investigation which is standard operating procedure.Paul Skellon a spokesman for Mesa Airlines which operates U.S. Airways Express flights said that Ms. Gotbaum was not denied boarding her flight. She simply arrived too late he said. The door to the gate had already closed the jetway had disengaged from the plane and the plane was about to push back he said.Mr. Manning said that Ms. Gotbaum was in the Phoenix airport for what was to have been a brief layover on her way to Tucson where she planned to enter an alcoholism treatment program. He said he did not know how long she had had a drinking problem.The Daily News today quoted unidentified airport workers as saying that Ms. Gotbaum screamed “I’m not a terrorist!” and struggled with security officers as she was subdued.According to Sergeant Hill the police are investigating the circumstances of the death as is the Maricopa County medical examiner’s office which covers Phoenix.Ms. Gotbaum a mother of three lived on the Upper West Side. Her husband is Noah E. Gotbaum an investor who has worked in Eastern Europe. They married on June 10 1995 at a ceremony in Central Park.According to the couple’s wedding announcement published in The Times Ms. Gotbaum was a daughter of Cmdr. and Mrs. Henry B. Stiger of Cape Town South Africa. At the time Ms. Gotbaum was a senior buyer in London for the House of Frasier a department store company. She received an M.B.A. from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Her father retired as the commander of the South African Navy Diving School in Simonstown. Her previous marriage had ended in divorce.Mr. Gotbaum was a director of the Central Europe Trust Company a consulting and investment firm in London. He graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1977 and from Amherst College in 1981 and he received a master’s degree in public policy management from Yale University in 1989.Mr. Gotbaum is the son of Victor Gotbaum who for many years was executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees the city’s largest alliance of public sector unions and his former wife Dr. Sarah C. Gotbaum. Victor and Sarah Gotbaum divorced in the early 1970s.Betsy Gotbaum married Victor Gotbaum in 1976. Betsy Gotbaum has been the city’s parks commissioner and the president of the New-York Historical Society. In 2001 she was elected public advocate; she was re-elected in 2005. As the city’s second-highest-ranking official the public advocate is first in line to be mayor if the mayor should die or become incapacitated.Betsy Gotbaum told reporters in a statement outside her Central Park West home on Sunday:This is a horrible tragedy for my family for my stepson and my three grandchildren. Carol was a wonderful person. She was a wonderful mother. She was sweet and kind and loving. At this moment we are awaiting the results of the investigation. We don’t know any more than what has been reported in the press. This is obviously very very difficult for us. We are dealing with it as best we can. My No. 1 focus is those children and my stepson. And I hope the press will consider our feelings and please please please don’t ask us any more questions. We made the statement. We will let you know as soon as we can. Thank you.Ms. Gotbaum’s office released a further statement this afternoon:We are not jumping to any conclusions but the circumstances surrounding Carol’s death appear to be unusual enough to raise serious questions and warrant a thorough investigation. Carol who was only five foot seven and one-hundred and five pounds appears to have been manhandled by the Phoenix Police Department. She was a loving and devoted mother of three children under the age of nine who was on her way to an alcohol rehabilitation facility to seek treatment for herself. She cried out for help at the airport but her pleas appear to have been met by mistreatment.A woman who answered the telephone at a home of Carol Gotbaum’s relatives in Cape Town said the family did not wish to discuss the death. “This is a private family matter” the woman said.Lawrence Kobilinsky an expert in forensic science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice said that any number of factors might cause a person to die very quickly including a heart attack a cardiac arrhythmia or an aneurysm. Any death investigator would also examine whether drugs — prescription medications or illegal narcotics — were in the person’s system. Overdoses of methamphetamines and cocaine among other illicit drugs can be life-threatening.Dr. Howard C. Adelman an independent forensic pathologist and a former chief deputy medical examiner in Suffolk County said there have been cases in which police officers in subduing a suspect have placed pressure on the person’s chest constraining the ability to breathe. Similarly there have been cases where people have been restrained hogtied or handcuffed in an unusual position causing them to asphyxiate. In a situation known as excited delirium a person begins to act in a highly agitated state. That can lead to the release of adrenaline which in turn could cause a cardiac arrhythmia.Both experts emphasized that they were speaking about general possibilities and that an autopsy would have to be conducted to determine the cause of death.John Holusha John Sullivan and Mathew R. Warren contributed reporting. Sandra Jamison contributed research.

 9,Parliament elected Prime Minister Turgut Ozal President today for a seven-year term opening the way for a change of government under a new Prime Minister he will select.In a session boycotted by all 155 opposition members of Parliament 263 deputies from Mr. Ozal's governing Motherland Party voted for him.Fethi Celikbas the only other candidate and a member of Mr. Ozal's party received 14 votes.Mr. Ozal 62 years old was elected on the third ballot after failing to muster the required two-thirds majority of 300 votes in the first two ballots on Oct. 20 and 24. A simple majority was sufficient on the third ballot.Mr. Ozal became Turkey's first civilian President since 1960 and the first Prime Minister to move up to the highly respected but largely ceremonial post. He takes over from President Kenan Evren when his term expires Nov. 9.
 0,Following are excerpts from remarks by Senators Bob Smith Republican of New Hampshire and Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont in the Senate debate yesterday on the nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general as recorded by The New York Times:Senator SmithI consider it an honor and a privilege to stand here today in support of the nomination of John Ashcroft to be attorney general of the United States. Contrary to some of the rhetoric we've been hearing on the other side everybody and I say everybody in this institution knows that he's one of the finest people who ever served here. He's a man of great religious faith and a moral man. And yet as you listen to this debate if it wasn't for the fact that it was so personally destructive and so vindictive it would be humorous. Here you have a man who served six years in the United States Senate served two terms as governor two terms as the attorney general of the State of Missouri and yet to hear the debate here he's anti-child he's anti-woman he's anti-black he's anti-gays anti-Catholic. What else can possible be said? One thing we can be certainly be sure of: the left knows how to play politics and they do it well and I commend them for it.Unfortunately though sometimes in politics you destroy unfairly the reputations of people who don't deserve it. And that's what offends me the most. And I'm not going to use the term anger but it does offend me that this kind of personal destruction has to be used.I recall the comments earlier in the debate today of Senator Leahy when he said that there are 280 million Americans with divergent ethnic backgrounds and political views. Well out of that 280 million Americans according to the left if there are any of those 280 million Americans who are conservative and happen to be pro-life or pro-gun they can't be attorney general. Now if they are pro-choice or if they are anti-gun then they can be. And I would again remind my colleagues that the vote on Janet Reno was 98 to nothing. I think most of us would on this side of the aisle would agree that her views and ours were quite different. But we supported her nomination because the president of the United States has a right to pick his or her cabinet and that's a fact.And I just want to say that some of the comments especially as a Catholic I just want to respond directly to this anti-Catholic charge. It's so outrageous. A man is -- I don't know how people can look in the mirror to be candid about it and do this this kind of personal destruction. John Ashcroft let me read the letter that I just received a copy of the letter that I just received from Senator Kennedy's own cardinal Cardinal Law. I'm going to read it into the record:''Dear Senator Ashcroft let me begin by expressing my deep dismay at the unfounded and scurrilous charge that you could possibly harbor anti-Catholic feelings. I was astounded to hear that anyone was making such a ridiculous accusation. From my time as bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau until today I have always found you to be a man of honor integrity and deep faith. I recall with great fondness the many opportunities we had to work together on many issues affecting the lives of the good people of the State of Missouri. In a particular way I recall how kind and thoughtful you were to invite me to address the cardinal's annual prayer breakfast on Jan. 9 1992 when you were serving as the governor of Missouri. On that same day you also honored me with an invitation to address the Governor's Leadership Forum on Faith and Values. College students then and now are beneficiaries of your generous love and concern for them and their futures. I do not recall that you made any distinction between black white Protestant Catholic or Jew in your desire to instill in them a love for their faith their families and one another as brothers and sisters in the human family. Let me assure you John of my prayers in asking God to bless you Janet the children and all whom you hold dear. And with warm regards I am sincerely yours in Christ Cardinal Law Bernard Law Archbishop of Boston.''

 0,Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.In addition to the domestic challenge it presented the fledgling Confederacy posed a foreign policy dilemma for Abraham Lincoln’s administration. The Confederacy hoped to use its position as a crucial source of cotton to secure recognition from foreign powers and boost its legitimacy and it sent commissioners abroad to sway other countries into supporting its cause.In response Secretary of State William Seward threatened war against European countries who interfered in America’s domestic conflict. But the administration wasn’t the only branch to enter the foreign-policy fray: In July 1861 Representative Samuel Sullivan Cox a Democrat from Ohio submitted a resolution calling on Lincoln to share with the House “all correspondence with the English French Spanish and other Governments with reference to the right of blockade privateering and the recognition of the so-called confederate States.” It passed with bipartisan ease as did two more similar resolutions submitted during the following weeks.Lincoln hardly welcomed such extensive oversight; on July 25 the same day that Representative Timothy Howe a Republican from Wisconsin submitted the third of the resolutions the president sent word to the House that the “correspondence called for” would not be forthcoming at that time. The reason for the delay is unclear: of the three resolutions Cox’s mentioned that the correspondence could be submitted “at the beginning of the next session of Congress” and the administration appears to have taken that as an opportunity to wait as long as feasible to release the documents.Eventually however Lincoln complied. In doing so he not only provided his contemporaries and future Americans with an almost real-time detailed look into the daily operations of the country’s foreign policy apparatus in crisis but he set a precedent for State Department transparency that is still followed today.Because the resolutions passed with little or no discussion we have little direct evidence for what Congress was thinking at the time. But we can infer a few things from the broader context. For one such requests were hardly unprecedented: throughout the early republic the legislature had asked for (and the executive branch had supplied) diplomatic instructions and dispatches related to treaties boundary disputes and other foreign affairs. And of course the war made foreign policy an especially touchy subject; by examining the correspondence Congress surely hoped to see that Seward was instructing ministers to appropriately defend American interests and that the ministers were faithfully carrying out the instructions.After months of delay Lincoln finally complied with the resolutions. On Dec. 3 1861 as the second session of the 37th Congress got underway Lincoln sent a message to both houses of Congress. The “message” portion of this communication was quite brief but attached to it was correspondence between the United States and its ministers abroad bound together in one volume (you can read the volume here).Lincoln’s missive opened with a short discussion of foreign relations before turning to other domestic matters. He characterized the Confederate effort to gain recognition from foreign governments as sputtering and unsuccessful noting “the disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected.” After dismissing Confederate diplomatic efforts Lincoln announced that he had submitted the requested correspondence and he hoped that those who read it would see that his administration had “practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign powers averting causes of irritation; and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor.”There followed 425 pages of correspondence between the government and its diplomatic ministers abroad (the United States would not have proper “ambassadors” until 1893). After printing a series of general circulars the volume reproduced material regarding 24 countries: not only the major European powers but most of Latin America and even Egypt the Hawaiian Islands and Japan.The material wasn’t for Congress alone; the White House released it to the public as well. For those who could not get their hands on the volume itself copies of its contents traveled quickly up and down the coast published in newspapers.By perusing the documents Americans could see how the Union defended its interests in countries large and small near and far. Obviously staving off Confederate agents was a key task for America’s ministers. Seward wrote to Carl Schurz the minister to Spain that preventing the Confederacy from gaining recognition was “your chief duty and no more important one was ever devolved by the United States upon any representative whom they have sent abroad.”Even in countries of lesser importance ministers were urged to be on the watch. Although Seward did not believe that the Confederates would attempt to gain recognition immediately from Denmark he wrote to his representative there that “political action even of the more commanding or more active States is influenced by a general opinion that is formed imperceptibly in all parts of the Eastern continent. Every representative of the United States in Europe has therefore a responsibility to see that no effort on his part is wanting to make that opinion just so far as the true position of affairs is in his own country is concerned.”Representatives abroad had an important public relations role to play particularly when news traveled slowly across the Atlantic Ocean and rumors were rife. Seward’s instructions encouraged ministers to not let discouraging news from America cloud foreigners’ perceptions of the war effort. After the First Battle of Bull Run in a letter marked “confidential” he wrote to Charles Francis Adams the minister in London that “you will hear of a reverse of our arms in Virginia” and encouraged him to think little of it. “The vigor of the government will be increased and the ultimate result will be a triumph of the Constitution” Seward wrote. “Do not be misled by panic reports of danger apprehended for the capital.” Seward likewise wrote to William Lewis Dayton in France that “treason was emboldened by its partial success at Manassas but the Union now grows manifestly stronger every day.” Foreigners could get their news from any number of sources and ministers had to stand ready to put a positive spin on events.The volume also exposed domestic readers to the administration’s frustration with the willingness of the British to treat the Confederates as belligerents. This step granted the Confederates some credibility even if it fell short of the full recognition they desired. In these documents Northern readers could see unbiased proof that this action did not go without protest. Adams proclaimed to the British that the Americans were “irritated” by the British treatment of Confederates as belligerents.Slavery is mentioned throughout the volume although at this point in the war the rhetoric was more about the dangers of the political power of Southern slaveholders than the virtues of emancipation. Slavery certainly got credit for causing the war. Seward wrote to Dayton in France that “the attempted revolution is simply causeless. It is indeed equally without a reason and without an object unless it be one arising out of the subject of slavery.” Seward instructed the representative in Russia that although slavery had existed in all the states at the time of the American Revolution “it was expected that under the operation of moral social and political influences then existing the practice of slavery would soon cease.” The “cause” of the rebellion was the fact that the slave states having suffered defeat at the polls in 1860 “took an appeal from the verdict of the people rendered through the ballot-box to the sword and organized a revolution with civil war.”Related Disunion Highlights Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. See the Highlights »The decision to release the material won glowing reviews. The Baltimore Sun reported on Dec. 9 that the correspondence was “receiving that close attention from persons skilled in diplomacy and public law which belongs to its distinguished source and the magnitude of the subject in question.” The Keene New Hampshire Sentinel reported that “in the whole of this correspondence the Secretary of State exhibits marked ability as a statesman and diplomatist.”By January 1862 the correspondence had reached the West Coast; the San Francisco Bulletin reported that the diplomatic correspondence was “quite voluminous” and “highly interesting.” Seward again came in for praise; his “high-toned” and “courteous” messages were “as nearly perfect models of diplomatic correspondence as are to be found on the pages of modern history.” The correspondence with Adams and Dayton “have swept to the winds all the aspersions of those who have accused him of favoring a timid and wavering policy in dealing with the rebels.” The volume attracted attention from abroad as well; shortly after its release Lord Richard Lyons British minister to the United States sent a copy to Lord John Russell the British foreign minister.What can we learn from this volume of foreign affairs documentation released as the first year of the war drew to a close? First it represents what the Lincoln administration wanted the American public to know about foreign affairs (as distinct from telling us in the modern day everything we might like to know about diplomacy during the Civil War). Judging by the newspaper response Americans were pleased with how the federal government was acting. Publishing the documentation also exposed British and French actions toward the Confederates which helped Americans direct their ire toward those two countries.Second the publication of the volume demonstrates the balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches during the mid-19th century: although the executive branch bore responsibility for foreign policy the legislative branch could wield significant power by demanding to see copies of the documentation.Perhaps most importantly the volume illustrates an early attempt at government openness — and given the exigencies of wartime a surprisingly forthright one. The summer resolutions requesting the documents made an allowance for Lincoln’s assessment of the “public interest” in determining which documents not to submit to Congress and we have no way of knowing what type of selection policy was in place. At the same time the resolutions make clear that Congress expected to receive something. Indeed diplomatic correspondence was released to Congress on an ad hoc basis throughout the early republic; but that it was still done in a moment of clear crisis demonstrates that Lincoln’s administration saw the value in getting the correspondence in the public’s hands.There is a final consequence which no one in 1861 could likely have foretold: The State Department continues to publish edited collections of foreign affairs documentation 150 years later. Although the Foreign Relations of the United States series does not release documents as rapidly as Lincoln did and so has become a historical look at American foreign relations rather than a contemporary publication of documents the release of the volume in 1861 set a landmark democratic precedent: that the American government must on a regular basis keep the public informed about its foreign policy operations.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Sources: Congressional Globe; Howard Jones “Blue and Gray Diplomacy: A History of Confederate Foreign Relations”; Roy Basler ed. “Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln” Vol. IV; Message of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the Commencement of the Second Session of the 37th Congress.“Aaron W.

 0,Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's struggling casino empire reported a quarterly loss of nearly $49 million yesterday further undermining the company's tenuous financial position and complicating its ability to meet hefty debt payments due at the end of this month and in the fall.Trump Hotels has about $1.8 billion in debt that has drained the company of the cash it needs to maintain its properties and compete effectively in the Atlantic City gambling market. Over the last few months the company and its bondholders have been considering options to deal with the debt burden including a prepackaged bankruptcy or a recapitalization that would cede control of the company to a major investment bank.Either option would result in a sharply decreased role at Trump Hotels for Mr. Trump the chief executive who has been accused by analysts and bondholders of ineffective management and slipshod financial practices.Trump Hotels said it lost $48.8 million or $1.63 a share in the quarter compared with a loss of $24 million or $1.09 a share in the period a year earlier. Trump Hotels has never been profitable since it became a public company in 1995. The company said yesterday's losses included a provision of $19.1 million related to the payment of state taxes in Indiana. The company's quarterly revenue was $276.2 million down from $278.8 million.

 0,Yes there was a surge of patriotism after the Sept. 11 attacks and yes American soldiers are now in Iraq. Ms. Marenoff explained her mission in less far-reaching terms. She said she had been hired to broaden the Intrepid's audience and message. ''We're about the humanity behind the hardware'' she said. ''There's a common thread of heroism running through the Intrepid -- the idea 'I can be a hero in everyday life.' Or if veterans come in and see they've been honored then we've succeeded on that level.''Ms. Marenoff is 38 two years younger than G.I. Joe. And he ''was totally in the forefront of the boys in my childhood'' she said. ''You remember G.I. Joes being strong figures that represent heroism very American pure in a way. Parents were proud to have their kids play with them.''And Hasbro is happy to have G.I. Joe be something of a historical figure. ''We don't pursue today's events in the brand'' Mr. DePriest said. ''There's no Iraqi Freedom G.I. Joe. Instead we choose to take a higher road and commemorate heroes in uniform without tying them to specific events.''One recent Joe -- a 12-inch figure -- is a Navy Seal in an orange vest. Another features Duke a sergeant on the G.I. Joe team or so says an identification card on the package. Duke is thoroughly modern -- so much so that he talks. When his stomach is pushed his mouth opens in an O-shape and recorded phrases like ''lock and load'' or ''get the others -- we're going in'' come out. But there is a disjointedness to Joe's speech patterns. He. Talks. Like. This. With. A. Noticeable. Pause. Between. Each. Word. No. Battlefield. Commander. Could. Survive. Giving. Orders. This. Slowly.Which is not what Mr. DePriest remembers from his boyhood. ''You could impart any sort of adventure on G.I. Joe'' Mr. DePriest said. ''What we loved was he was a real guy a real hero as opposed to a superhero or a robot. When you get three boys together thinking about adventures you could do with G.I. Joe the options were limitless. G.I. Joe was a great thing that really brought us together and fueled our imaginations.''What he imagined he said was not necessarily military action. ''We grew up in a time when the G.I. Joe on the shelves had shifted gears from the military to what was called the adventure team the fuzzy hair and the kung fu grip. One of the things that Hasbro advertised was there are 50 adventures of G.I. Joe and there are literally 50 sets of clothes you could get. We fell under the spell of this globe-trotting adventurer who was part environmentalist and part kung fu expert. We joined up on adventures that went all over our backyard.''

 0,The sidewalks of New York have their own song. Broadway has several. Well-known plays and movies have been set in or inspired by among many other New York locations the Waldorf the Plaza Wall Street Macy's Yankee Stadium Tiffany & Company Katz's Delicatessen and the late Cammareri Brothers Bakery in Carroll Gardens Brooklyn.But for all its importance to the city over the last 98 years the subway has been given relatively short shrift by the performing arts. Of course there are exceptions like ''Take the A Train'' and ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three'' and the great scenes in ''The French Connection.'' But the only major Broadway play with subway in the title ''Subways Are for Sleeping'' flopped in 1962 and the last big-budget movie set in the subway ''Money Train'' did not receive a warm critical reception. (''If this is not the end of the road for the cop buddy movie'' Roger Ebert lamented ''maybe it should be.'')As a hard-working muse and epic urban protagonist the subway surely deserves far better from the creative community however and so very recently some of its New York members have set about trying to redress this wrong.In May for example the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre staged ''theAtrainplays'' a group of three short musicals and three one-act plays.

 0,At the counter Ms. Maldonado explains to a clerk the purpose of her visit. She wants furniture for the new publicly subsidized apartment that she has just moved into. She had received a $706 grant only two months earlier which paid for beds for her two children and herself as well as a five-drawer dresser a kitchen table and four chairs. But she still needed something to sit on in the living room and a dresser for her own roomIt is unlikely that the city will help her she knows but she has no other way to pay. Although she has received training in Web design and emergency services and is now getting training as a nurse's aide Ms. Maldonado has not worked since 2001 when she was a receptionist. The father of her two children is in prison and contributes nothing to the family budget but she does receive some financial help from her boyfriend she said.The clerks give her a lavender slip and send her to the matching waiting room. Ms. Maldonado does not know it but this room was also a recent innovation designed for people with relatively simple requests like a public assistance card to replace one that had been lost or a child-care referral. In theory by separating people with more complex needs like applying for public assistance or child care both lines will move more swiftly.Still Ms. Maldonado is unappeased. Having been at the center in December she knows that all she has to do is fill out a form. With a pretty face and a dazzling smile she has had luck in the past using personal charm to shortcut the system. She tries here but to little avail. ''Can't you just give me the form now?'' she pleads with the clerks. But they insist that she has to get in the purple line.Once in the appropriately tinted section she takes a quick read of the situation and decides she is in for the long haul. The number printed on her slip is F3127 but on the electronic board that keeps track of clients being served there is only one F ticket being served -- F3078 at Window 4. Other letters like G and D are at other windows and nobody is going anywhere quickly. After F3078 does not change for 10 minutes Ms. Maldonado walks out at 12:50. She visits her lawyer (she is suing a previous landlord) and the subsidized housing office before heading back.2:25 p.m. Ticket F3078 is still being served at Window 4 according to the electronic board.By now the purple room is standing room only upwards of 50 people at least -- which is not bad compared to the gold floor where welfare cases are opened and more than 100 people waited on a recent afternoon. Still Ms. Maldonado is impatient.Not one to wait passively for the bureaucracy to do its work she marches around the corner to Window 4 to find the client responsible for the holdup. But there is no client only a worker typing into her computer and talking with other clerks. Ms. Maldonado goes to the counter and explains the reason for her pique. The clerk offers no explanation but promises the angry client that her number will be seen soon.
 0,MILAN – If Chris Mullin ever becomes a Knicks executive as has long been speculated he will surely be thrilled with the roster he inherits.Mullin came to Italy this week to help the N.B.A. promote the Knicks’ exhibition game against Armani Jeans Milano. On Friday he presided over a 3-point contest on the plaza next to the Duomo and later participated in a community service event.Donnie Walsh the Knicks president has long been fond of Mullin who once played for Walsh’s Indiana Pacers. There are persistent rumors that Walsh wants to hire Mullin but has been blocked by team ownership.Mullin skirted the speculation on Friday but he enthusiastically praised the work Walsh has done to revitalize the Knicks.“I think it’s been pretty dramatic actually” Mullin told a handful of New York reporters. “Now you’ve got to wait and see how it is on the court. But they’ve made a lot of changes. Obviously Amar’e is a huge part of that.”Walsh stripped the roster over the last two years to clear salary-cap room with LeBron James as the primary target. When James chose Miami Walsh landed Amar’e Stoudemire one of the top big men in the league then filled out the roster with a number of promising players including Raymond Felton Anthony Randolph Roger Mason Kelenna Azubuike and Timofey Mozgov.“I don’t know anyone who could have done a better job than he’s done already” Mullin said. “The work he did to get under the cap to be in the position he was last summer and then to get Amar’e that’s the way you do it. You always have a plan and Donnie wherever he’s been there’s no mistake his teams have gradually gotten better.”Mullin said that Stoudemire’s presence would make a huge difference particularly for talented young players like Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari.“When you have a team of good players almost on a daily basis you’re kind of scouring around to see where the pyramid falls into place” said Mullin a former Golden State Warriors general manager. “When you get a key guy like Amar’e not only does it help situate your team I think it helps the other guys focus on what they do best. Sometimes when you don’t have that marquee guy you try to do more than you’re capable of doing.”Needless to say Mullin is also optimistic about the future of Randolph. Mullin after all drafted him for the Warriors in 2008. Randolph is fantastically athletic but unpolished. He has been slowed by injuries.“His talent is incredible” Mullin said. “He’s a hard worker he’s a good kid. Careers take different paths. He was injured last year. But what I saw of him in practice his potential is pretty high. Sometimes that’s dangerous because there is so much talent there. But I think once he gets into a stable situation he’ll do really well.”As for his own future Mullin said he wanted to return to an N.B.A. front office eventually but was in no rush. He said he had had no recent discussions with Walsh.“I’ve been doing a lot for the N.B.A. Taking these trips has been great” he said. “So for me the right situation comes up I would definitely look at it. But I’m not really struggling with what I’m doing. I’m pretty happy. So no no real time frame on that.”

 0,COUSINS NIGHT I have cousins that are in the tristate area so sometimes we’ll meet up and we’ll have cousins night. We’re all female cousins — our male cousins are far away — and I’m the oldest. It’s like they all come to their big sister’s house because I have the furniture the good food and the big TV. And Toni will totally let us take over the living room. She’ll feed us — she’ll make homemade chicken fingers and chili — and we’ll have drinks — the cousins will bring the alcohol — and we just laugh and talk. They know I want to be on TV so they’ve been coming over and doing my makeup and skin care. One of my cousins works for Bustle so she’ll tell me the latest skin care routine. They just keep me young really and in the know. Toni will go in the bedroom and watch sports while we do all that.FAMILY DINNER As a kid we always had Sunday dinner. But now me my wife my aunt who is like a second mother and her son are the only ones still in Brooklyn. So we still have them but now we have them at Patsy’s. I’m Italian and Haitian and my zia is from Italy and she really loves it because they know her there; it’s like a family establishment. And on Sunday nights they have live music so it all just works out. It’s my Saturday night because I don’t work Mondays so we go we walk in and everybody’s like “Oh Teresa!” to my aunt. There’s kisses we sit down and it’s very much a time to eat long and slow and much. I get the spaghetti carbonara almost every time and tiramisù for dessert.

 9,A Federal judge yesterday struck down major sections of the 1996 act that deregulated the telecommunications industry saying that the law unfairly kept the regional Bell telephone companies out of the long-distance business.If the judge's ruling withstands appeals it would allow the Bell companies nationwide to offer long-distance service for the first time since the AT&T Corporation was broken up under court supervision in 1984. Long-distance giants which could face a range of new competitors are almost certain to challenge the decision.''This is so big I can't believe it'' said Scott Cleland a telecommunications analyst in Washington for the Legg Mason Precursor Group. ''This was the cornerstone of the telecom act. This turns the telecom act upside down.''Yesterday's ruling was the latest and largest salvo in a battle mostly between state regulators and the Bell companies on one side and Federal regulators and the long-distance carriers on the other. The long-distance companies and the Federal Communications Commission have been pushing the Bells to demonstrate that their networks are wide open to competitors before the Bells can offer long-distance service. The Bells and many state regulators have said the commission is making excessive demands on the Bells.
 9,With an eye toward the convergence of the Internet and next-generation digital cellular networks Motorola plans to announce a new chip design on Monday that is meant to support a wide range of cellular telephone standards while offering more computer-like features.The new chip family is part of Motorola's effort to move its chip production beyond supplying the company's own cell-phone business and toward competing directly in the cellular market with chip makers like Texas Instruments Royal Philips Electronics and Qualcomm.''We've been extremely quiet; now we want people to know we're open for business'' said Mario Rivas the general manager of Motorola's wireless subscriber systems group.This year 225 million cellular telephones will be sold worldwide accounting for the sale of $10.7 billion worth of semiconductors according to researchers at the International Data Corporation a market research firm in Mountain View Calif.

 9,On the back of John C. Salvi 3d's black pickup was an oversized picture of an aborted fetus. It was a picture of Jesus Christ Mr. Salvi told people.His neighbors and co-workers today described the 22-year-old suspect in abortion clinic shootings who was a student at the Portsmouth Beauty School as quiet and withdrawn. They knew little about him they said other than that he was deeply religious and wanted to be a hairdresser. Even law-enforcement officials said today that they knew little about his background although they said that he did not appear to be connected to any anti-abortion groups."He was just an oddball" said Rick Griffin who had hired Mr. Salvi in May to sweep floors at Eccentric Hair a beauty salon 10 miles north of here.But on Dec. 23 said Mr. Griffin and others Mr. Salvi erupted. A customer came into the store that day said Doreen Potter the manager of Eccentric Hair "and John just ripped the guy's coat off forcefully." Ms Potter added: "The guy asked for his jacket back and John said 'No you can't have it.' Finally John gave him his coat and the guy left. John yelled 'And don't you ever come back again ever!' Then he sat down with a smirk on his face."

 9,Advocates of school decentralization here reacted with dismay and sadness to Dr. Kenneth B. Clark's announcement before the Temporary State Charter Revision Commission for New York City that he had become a “vehement foe” of decentralization.“I think Ken is expressing as usual his deep frustration about the progress of education” said David Seeley director of the Public Education Association. “But even more disastrous would be to try to return to a centralized body which for a period of 20 years showed itself increasingly unable to cope with the problems.”Dr. Clark one of the early advocates of school decentralization told the commission in private testimony that decentralization had become a “disastrous” experiment in which the basic issue—teaching children—had beed subordinated to “racial politics.”While not advocating a return to the old centralized school system Dr. Clark a professor of psychology at City College and a member of the State Board of Regents warned Against a “simplistic manipulation of the bureaucratic structure.”
 9,The Who's 25th anniversary tour which came to Giants Stadium on Thursday might be called ''the Who cash in'' as the reunited band reprises its songs for a summer's work projected to bring in about $30 million. Thursday's concert was mammoth in every way - in attendance (54000 for the first of four nights) in the size of the band (15 members) and in length (more than three hours of music).The crowd would probably have been pleased with a run-through of greatest hits. But in an unpredictable program that included hits a sizable part of the rock opera ''Tommy'' and a selection of cover versions and material from band members' solo albums the Who was both generous and almost vulnerable. The band revealed itself not just as earth-shaking stadium-rockers - though there are few experiences in rock to compare with hearing ''Won't Get Fooled Again'' as tens of thousands of arms wave and voices sing along - but as eccentric even playful rock elder statesmen jumping around the stage.The original Who members - the singer Roger Daltrey the guitarist-songwriter Pete Townshend and the bassist John Entwistle - played ''Magic Bus'' and ''Mary-Anne With the Shaky Hands'' on their own. Otherwise the sound was filled out by Simon Phillips on drums (replacing the late Keith Moon) and auxiliary guitar keyboards percussion horns and singers not all of whom were strictly necessary.The band members' solo features implied perhaps misleadingly each one's contributions to the Who - Mr. Entwistle's brute-force rock Mr. Townshend's earnest pop and Mr. Daltrey's fondness for the blues. But choices outside the Who's catalogue were often embarrassing; instead of others' material the Who might have revived songs that aren't on its greatest-hits albums. For its encore the Who proudly declared itself a 1960's band with ''Barefootin''' ''Hey Joe'' and the Beatles' arrangement of ''Twist and Shout.''

The executive vice president Peter D. McDonald said the biggest savings $200 million a year would come from the maintenance department. United also wants to save $150 million a year on airport operations. Other savings will come from fuel distribution reservation centers and at the United Express regional carrier. United has said it will probably terminate its four employee pension plans and replace them with less-generous programs.

 0,ROSENTHAL--Nan age 76 died peacefully at home on Sunday April 27 2014. Beloved wife of Henry B. Cortesi she was born in New York City on August 27 1937. She graduated from the Fieldston School Sarah Lawrence College and earned a PhD from Harvard. She began her career in journalism but turned to the study of art history focusing on post-WWII American artists. She excelled as a scholar curator teacher and mentor. Nan was Senior Consultant of 20th Century Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art until her retirement in 2008. Before moving back to New York after her marriage to Henry in 1991 she was curator of 20th Century Art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and before that a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Over her long varied and highly distinguished career she accumulated a very large diverse and devoted group of friends who enlivened and enriched her life as she did theirs.

 0,Other than a pair of two-out walks Jon Niese had a solid outing in his spring debut. Aside from the walks he allowed just two hits while striking out two in a 5-3 loss to the Nationals. Niese needed only 22 pitches to get through three innings.Last year Niese showed that he was capable of winning at the major league level but the Mets felt he grew tired at the end of the season. This year he needs to conserve energy in the second half of the season.“He’s now gone through one full season and he’s got to realize what it takes now he knows what it takes now to be able to get through the season” Manager Terry Collins said. “I think at the end he got tired got a little fatigued and it gets to a point where you might want to back off some stuff.”¶Oliver Perez who had trouble throwing strikes in his first outing Sunday will pitch again Thursday. Perez threw in the bullpen Tuesday and the pitching coach Dan Warthen said he was no different than the last time. Warthen seemed to be referring to Perez’s last bullpen session not the game because he said Perez threw strikes.

 9,THURSDAY'S assemblage of music by the New Music Consort at Weill Recital Hall seemed touched by a variety of influencing hands yet all these pieces followed the serious steadfastness of purpose that has marked mainstream 20th-century composition.Thus postwar jazz for example is very much the substance of Charles Wuorinen's Trio for Trombone Percussion and Piano while in Ruth Meyer's ''Fragments of Sappho'' her spare harp writing and the flute part's bendings of pitch gave an almost Japanese accompaniment to these song settings for soprano.Two of Thursday's pieces seemed more self-contained in style owing - or at least referring - less to outside influences. One was Pierre Boulez's ''Derive'' a very beautiful single movement bound together by long strands of tremulous instrumental tone. The three-year-old work is written for flute clarinet violin cello vibraphone and piano (here conducted by Claire Heldrich) and in describing it one wants to celebrate both the power of its elegance and the elegance of its power.The second of the two is even more recent - Elliott Carter's ''Esprit Rude/Esprit Doux'' for flute and clarinet. Here intricately contrapuntal networks and very high spirits (often emphasized by the upper registers of both instruments) operate symbiotically. In keeping with the title Mr. Carter's high energy is interrupted in midstream by cooler layers of sustained and overlapping tones.

 9,Windows 98 went on sale last week with little fanfare and supported by a puny marketing budget compared with the spending for its relentlessly promoted predecessor Windows 95. And Windows 98 also came to market under a legal cloud as Exhibit A in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation.No matter it seems at least not in the first few days. Windows 98 flew off store shelves just as quickly as did Windows 95 when it went on sale even slightly faster according to PC Data a market research firm.In the first four days of sales from last Thursday through Sunday retailers sold 530000 copies of Windows 98 PC Data reported yesterday based on daily sales reports from 20 chains with 6000 stores. In its first four days on the market three years ago Windows 95 sold 510000 copies.Microsoft had sought to deflate expectations for Windows 98 positioning the new operating system as a ''tune-up'' to its predecessor instead of a ground-breaking new product. With the low-key introduction most analysts had expected Windows 98 sales to build more gradually than was the case with Windows 95.

 0,Lehmann Maupin39 Greene Street SoHoThrough June 16Jeffrey Vallance's second New York solo show is disappointing. The hilarious drawings and collages he showed here in 1999 revealed this veteran California subversive to be an expert and zany cartoonist a funny and engaging writer and a perversely assiduous student of popular religions. This exhibition restricts the free play of his goofy enthusiasms.The main event is a trio of life-size wax figures made by a professional fabricator Victor Hugo. One is a satin-robed figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Another represents President Richard M. Nixon whose image Mr. Vallance claims to have found miraculously reflected in the eyes of a Mexico City Virgin of Guadalupe. Mr. Vallance has also detected images of evil clowns in the markings on the Shroud of Turin; a collage in the show documents his being rebuked by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights for publishing this discovery the artist's respectful explanation of his motives and the league's retraction of its rebuke.The third wax figure represents the poet Dante. A gallery release says he was included ''because of the immense influence the 'Inferno' has had on Vallance's life and work.'' Right.All of this is amusing to think about but it lacks the idiosyncratic energy of a drawing titled ''The Devil Hates Good Art'' in which a portrait of Satan is surrounded by terms indicating artistic qualities he objects to including talent and mastery eccentricity sincerity and uniqueness. Mr. Vallance is most engaging after all when he articulates his crazily convoluted ideas in quantity and by means of his own hand. KEN JOHNSON
 0,Add the world-renowned Riccardo Muti who recently took over as the C.S.O.’s music director and you have the sort of star-power lineup that say the Cubs have been seeking for years. Even more than sports teams classical music needs that kind of celebrity these days.No niche of the performing arts has felt the sting of the digital revolution more than music. The record industry has been damaged by easily copied MP3 files. IPods allow listeners to hear music all day everywhere: no need to step into a concert hall or arena. As improved technology brings higher-quality downloads and high-definition video streaming even the most persnickety orchestra and opera fans can find reasons to avoid live events: why contend with traffic parking audience sniffles or a plain old off-night on stage?A 2008 study by the National Endowment for the Arts surveyed adults attending arts performances at least once during the previous year. Since 2002 the classical music audience has declined by almost 20 percent and the opera audience by 30 percent.Susan Mathieson Mayer director of communications for the Lyric put the blame for the drop in attendance on cutbacks in arts education in public schools. “We survey opera subscribers continuously and almost invariably they had some kind of exposure when they were kids: music lessons parents taking them to concerts et cetera” she said. “Times are very different from 20 years ago. We’re dealing with maybe two generations who did not have the same kind of exposure that their parents did.”Deborah F. Rutter president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association identified another factor. “The competition for leisure time is so much more challenging than it was 20 to 30 years ago” she said. In fact given the lure of computer-driven entertainment she finds it “fascinating that this passion and excitement still exist for the live concert experience.”But that passion belongs to an increasingly older audience. The N.E.A. survey found that in 2008 nearly 40 percent of the symphony audience and about 35 percent of operagoers were older than 55. By comparison the audience for Latin music among the most popular idioms surveyed counts only about 20 percent of its audience in that demographic.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For $10 registered students can reserve a ticket online weeks before a concert; when they show up they get the best available seats. “They could be in a lower balcony seat that normally runs $120” Ms. Rutter said noting that last year the program attracted some 14000 students.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Lyric’s NEXT program sends an e-blast to college students announcing unsold tickets. “This past year we had probably close to 10000 college students attending at a cost of $20 a ticket” for seats that can sell for up to $200 Ms. Mayer said.Some seemingly novel concepts are firmly rooted in centuries of tradition. Ms. Fleming hit on the idea of bringing Broadway to the Lyric last summer when she was in Vienna visiting an exhibition about Gustav Mahler the 19th-century composer and opera director. “Mahler was quoted as saying how excited he was to be presenting works by Mozart 100 years after they were written” Ms. Fleming said. “I thought that would be a good place to start in the U.S. too” with homegrown works from the previous century.At Houston Grand Opera Mr. Freud left his stamp with “The Refuge” a 2007 production for which he commissioned a poet and a composer to interview hundreds of non-native Houstonians to learn their “journey stories” — how they ended up in the city — and turn them into a full-fledged production.“On one level you can regard opera as a 400-year-old European art form” he said in Chicago the day after his hiring. ”But if you distill opera it’s simply telling stories through words and music and that transcends history and ethnicity.”The Lyric has already dipped a toe in these waters notably with the 2010-11 season’s finale “Hercules.” The famed director Peter Sellars drew on weeks of workshops with American military veterans to transfer the story from ancient Greece to the modern United States and to explore the difficulties that returning soldiers have in leaving the traumas of war on the battlefield.Do such productions build audiences? At a reception following the opera’s dress rehearsal which was attended by more than 75 of the military veterans who had worked with Mr. Sellars several allowed that this was their first opera experience and that they did not really follow much of the action onstage. While it is unlikely that many of them will return the production did attract major news media exposure.Similarly the inmates from Warrenville probably will not rush off to sign up for the new season at the Chicago Symphony when they are released. But the idea behind that program and others in the orchestra’s ambitious Citizen Musician initiative is to expand the audience indirectly by building community ties. “By going beyond the seats in Orchestra Hall they’re doing the right thing” Mr. Ma said.And such experiences leave their mark on the consulting musicians as well. “What a musician does is collect all these experiences and then report back in sound” Mr. Ma said. “I know after this the Dvorak Concerto sounds different when I play it. There’s more love there — more humanity.”

 0,In March 2003 Mr. Jimenez called his wife and children in Mexico and told them he was coming home. He looked thin and pale when they greeted him at the airport. The next day his wife said she drove him to see a team of cardiac specialists in the capital city of Tabasco.Ms. Lopez says doctors there soon gave up on her husband and even discouraged him from seeking a transplant in Mexico City. She says doctors told her that he would die waiting for a donated heart and that even if one became available in time the family would never be able to afford the operation.This year with little money left for medicine Mr. Jimenez took a turn for the worse. A doctor gave him less than a month to live."I started sobbing when he told me that it was best if I just bought him an oxygen tank and left him on his bed to die" Ms. Lopez said. "But I told him that I was going to keep fighting for my husband until it is God's will that he be left alone."Meanwhile family members in New York had heard a rumor that a woman with heart trouble had had a no-cost operation at a Manhattan hospital even though she was an illegal immigrant."We thought it would be easier this time" Columba Jimenez said although the family learned later that operation was for a heart valve replacement and not a transplant.In any case the couple packed a suitcase and headed for the American border where Mr. Jimenez's brothers had arranged for a smuggler to lead them across by car. From there an eight-day drive to New York City began. It ended at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue near the Port Authority Bus Terminal where the remainder of the $8000 that relatives had agreed to pay smugglers exchanged hands.

 0,How We Got Here
 0,Slide ShowTHURSDAY PUZZLE — I truly hope you’re not sick of hearing about the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament because we’re not done yet. Yes the big boards have been put away and I’m still working on another photo feature called “Humans of A.C.P.T.” but in the meantime above are some highlights from Puzzle 7.Today’s bonus question is this: When is a homage to a fellow constructor not merely a homage?Answer: When it’s a collaboration with the very constructor you were honoring.In 2008 a puzzle by Joe Krozel garnered a lot of attention because the black squares formed a word that seemed incendiary for a crossword puzzle. If you haven’t solved this one give it a try. The concept behind the letters formed by the black squares and their connection to the clues made a Thursday puzzle — supposedly the “trickiest” one of the week if not the most difficult — absolutely take flight.Today Timothy Polin collaborates with Mr. Krozel on a similarly awesome idea that also carves a word into the grid. Not happy with merely one word however our constructors have chose to anagram the four letters S H U and T and turn the conceit of “clue in the clues entry in the grid” on its ear. While the bracketed [One arrangement of the letters in the grid] is what we’re given in the clue list the clue to the anagrammed arrangement of letters is actually the answer. Not sure what I’m babbling about? Check this out:1 Across: CABANAS which is what you get when the four letters spell “H-U-T-S” 21 Across: SEAL which is what you get when the four letters spell “S-H-U-T” 8 Down: REAR which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-U-S-H” 26 Down: ERGO which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-H-U-S”And while there is the teensiest bit of junk in the grid I think the fill here is mic-drop fabulous. Look at those long entries: STUPID PET TRICKS ATOMIC REACTORS REESE’S PIECES (you had me right there Messrs. Polin and Krozel) SPINAL TAP BLEEP OUT NATIONAL PASTIME ALL THOSE AGAINST (my personal favorite) and SEASONED TO TASTE.Our constructors have a lot to say about the construction of this very cool puzzle so I’ll turn it over to them:Constructors’s Notes:Timothy Polin: When I thought up this idea about a year ago I held out almost no hope that I’d be able to complete the puzzle on my own. Such a wide-open grid was pretty daunting even without four theme answers that had to fit somewhere. I played around with it and managed to fit three themers and fill everything left of the S but I just couldn’t finish the East half. So I set the puzzle aside. In all likelihood it would have remained in draft limbo forever too had Joe not written me a very kind email last year after my comments on Xword Info had referenced a couple of his puzzles. I jumped at the chance to ask the creator of this puzzle’s inspiration for his take on my take of his grid letter concept. By some miracle he liked the idea and it took us five or six weeks to go from empty grid to submission. The final grid ended up with about half of Joe’s fill and about half of mine. Joe did tremendous work refining the theme insisting among other things that the theme entries be at least four letters long and spaced throughout the grid. Using SIC instead of ERGO for example would have made our task easier but the longer entry felt more elegant and more exact. Joe Krozel: Tim approached me with this puzzle theme all worked out and I was impressed that he had found a set of letters to accomplish the trick. So the challenge that Tim invited me to undertake was to actually fill a grid which embodied his idea. My first little bit of meddling was to shorten the S and expand the H and the U … reducing the three-letter count from 24 to 17. We knew the East region would be difficult so we generated a list of potential theme words that could be sprinkled around the grid. I suspected that a short theme entry could hide inside the ‘S’ so it was only a matter of being persistent to get that region to fill. Once that section was locked down and PORTRAITS was in place we concentrated on the West until achieving a fill we were happy with. We both had fun last August trying to figure out how to “solve” this puzzle’s construction and we hope you enjoy your own solves as well.I would say that Mr. Polin and Mr. Krozel have given their puzzle that “extra push” as Nigel Tufnel of SPINAL TAP would say:Your thoughts?In an earlier version of this post the word “TUSH” was presented as an entry in the crossword puzzle. The word “REAR” is the entry and the anagrammed black square letters can spell out the word “TUSH.” Also the word “ERGO” is the entry while “THUS” is the anagrammed black letter spelling. Stop laughing. This is my job.

 0,Nick Kurczewski for The New York TimesIntroduced on Thursday: 2011 Kia SportageWhat is it? The Sportage compact S.U.V. has been part of Kia’s lineup since 1993. (Don’t feel bad most people never noticed it before now.) But fresh new packaging and a 176-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder (with a turbo version on the way) could put the 2011 Sportage on many shopping lists.Is it real? Yes but if you ever saw or drove the previous generation Sportage you might not believe it. The all-new 2011 Sportage is further proof that the Korean automaker has made huge improvements since those humble beginnings.What they said: “Good design should never feel forced” said Peter Schreyer Kia’s chief design officer during the news conference.What they didn’t say: Kia has not announced pricing for the Sportage which goes on sale this fall.What makes it tick? A 176 horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder are available and both come mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Either engine can be had with two or four-wheel drive.How much how soon? Expect only a modest bump from the current 2010 Sportage base price of $16995 when the new model goes on sale later this year. Compact S.U.V.’s like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 cost several thousand dollars more.How does it look? I saw the Kia Sportage for the first time during the Geneva auto show and thought I was at the wrong stand the new model looks so much better than past efforts. A closer look in New York only slightly alters those first impressions. The 2011 Sportage looks modern solid and substantial.
 9,A 12500-square-foot center for the performing arts has opened in downtown Indianapolis. The Indianapolis Artsgarden with seating for 400 rises into a 95-foot-high dome and is connected by covered catwalks to the new Circle Center retail and entertainment complex. The design architects for the Artsgarden and the center were Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut Architects of New York.Regular programming at the Arts garden which was financed by the Lilly Endowment will include visual arts and craft exhibitions music dance and theater films lectures and festivals.Among the events already scheduled are a free Tuesday-night Twilight Performance series in which Indianapolis arts groups will offer previews of performances; an Artists-in-Residence series that opens Oct. 14 with exhibits by a local sculptor Kevin Robert Leslie and a monthlong African-American Arts Festival next February.Opening hours for the Artsgarden at Illinois and Washington Streets are Monday to Saturday from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Sunday from noon to 6 P.M.
 9,Once upon a time people thought Joe Namath was a long-haired rebel.Today the 54-year-old happily married father of two girls had advice for the Jets' most controversial player Keyshawn Johnson: apologize to Wayne Chrebet.Asked to respond to Namath's suggestion Johnson said no.Some of Namath's controversies during the 1960's seem quaint now -- sporting a Fu Manchu mustache donning pantyhose for a commercial. There was however a more painful period for Namath when he briefly retired after refusing to sell his interest in a restaurant Bachelors III that the National Football League security office believed was a hangout of alleged mob figures.The controversy swirling around Johnson's book appears to be lingering longer than its sales. In ''Just Give Me the Damn Ball!'' the receiver described his rookie season in passages interspersed with capital letters and bold face and italic sentences and he called Chrebet the team mascot and suggested he would have a hard time making other teams. There were also passages of grudging praise for Chrebet the workmanlike receiver from Hofstra University.''If in fact he did say that Chrebet couldn't play for any other team in the N.F.L. Keyshawn better look in the mirror or listen to somebody'' Namath said. ''He's got to understand he's wrong.''

 0,Remarkably even his association with Mussolini's Fascist regime from 1922 to 1943 seems not to have disturbed his tranquillity. In 1928 he wrote: ''I have had much faith in Fascism since its first inklings faith that has never ebbed not even in the darkest and most tumultuous moments.'' The regime and the reactionary Strapaese (literally ''supra-country'') movement in turn acclaimed his art as a reaffirmation of eternal values and a rejection of decadent internationalism. And yet once World War II was over Morandi emerged unblemished even winning the painting prize at the 1948 Venice Biennale.The public recognition that followed did spread his renown beyond a small circle of collectors and he even donated some paintings to public museums including ''Still Life 1946'' to the Tate Gallery to this day the only Morandi in the Tate's permanent collection. Yet even as he increased his pace of production he remained ''a contemplative craftsman'' as Matthew Gale collections curator at the Tate writes in a catalog essay.''It takes me weeks to make up my mind which group of bottles will go well with a particular tablecloth'' Morandi once said. ''Then it takes me weeks of thinking about the bottles themselves and yet I often still go wrong with the spaces. Perhaps I work too fast.''When it came to painting he apparently did work quickly as evidenced by his confident brush strokes. But the preparation was time-consuming. He stretched his own canvases he made his own paint he stripped bottles of their labels he filled transparent vases with paint and then emptied them to create an opaque look he painted other vases and he allowed all the objects to accumulate dust. Sometimes he tested his compositions with pencil and paper but more often he simply moved the objects around until he was satisfied. And when he was ready to work he placed his easel just 18 inches from the objects. With landscapes which he invariably viewed through a studio window he found a different solution to the problem of composition. Since he could not move buildings trees or hills he used binoculars to frame the images that he wanted to capture.Some critics have compared Morandi's geometric structures to chess games both ''intellectual and strategic'' as Charles Derwent wrote in The Independent of London. Others like Waldemar Januszcak writing in The Sunday Times of London see an ''intense and silent melancholy'' in his still lifes. Yet for an understanding of this artist's artist perhaps artists should have the last word.''I personally couldn't care less about a bunch of bottles but I'm sure glad Morandi could'' Mr. Close writes in the Tate's catalog. ''The formal invention nuanced adjustments and surprisingly highly charged psychological content thrill me.'' Or as Sarah Jackson an English architect writes: ''In the Morandi paintings some see bottles. I see cities. I explore boundaries. Morandi paints me a city that is mine.''So the answer to the mystery it seems is to look beyond what he is painting.''Jettison 'bottles' from your mind's eye and enjoy a tactile feast of what Morandi does with a single stroke of paint'' Mr. Irwin invites. ''Wonder at how much happens when any one thing touches crowds or intersects with another. Just kick back and enjoy the subtlety of his color and the nuances of his edges and surfaces. This is the incredible economy of means that marks the essence of a master painter of the real.''

 0,A panel of outside investigators appointed by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in its report that “a lack of leadership on the part of key senior Mission personnel culminated in a chaotic and ineffective response to the violence.” Mr. Ban said in a statement that he was “deeply distressed by these findings” and reiterated his “outrage over the acts of violence committed in Juba in July and the continuing betrayal of the people of South Sudan by too many of its leaders.”His spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told reporters at a daily news briefing that Mr. Ban had “asked for the immediate replacement of the force commander.”That commander Lt. Gen. Johnson Mogoa Kimani Ondieki of Kenya was appointed less than six months ago and was described in an official announcement at the time as a highly accomplished international military officer with 34 years of experience.In days of fighting that convulsed Juba the inquiry said two Chinese peacekeepers were killed and several wounded and 182 buildings in the United Nations compound were struck by bullets mortar shells and rocket-propelled grenades as thousands of civilians sought refuge there.
 0,That's a pretty big checklist no doubt. But these tasks are far more doable than trying to rewind history to re-create a pre-civil rights era Democratic South in post-civil rights America.The South has long been America's regional political outlier. When the Republicans dominated national politics for seven decades between the Civil War and the New Deal they did so with almost no support from the South. Thanks to the significant African-American population base in the South the Democrats will never be so handicapped from the outset because there will always be a minimum degree of Democratic support and number of Democratic elected officials in the region. Building a non-southern majority therefore should be much easier for Democrats today than it was for the Republicans a century ago. Anyone who claims otherwise is willfully ignoring partisan history not to mention contemporary demography.As Democrats expand their non-southern support the South will continue to assimilate into the national political culture from which it had mostly divorced itself until recent decades. Then and only then can Democrats begin to rebrand themselves in Dixie. In the interim the Democrats' near-term goal should be to isolate the Republicans as a regional party that owns most of the South but little else.FLUNKING THE LITMUS TESTThe Republicans now dominate the South. Neither Al Gore nor John Kerry won a single southern state in their consecutive failed presidential bids. The GOP controls solid majorities of southern governors and members of Congress and a growing share of state legislative chambers and seats. In 2004 Republicans barely broke a sweat in claiming all five U.S. Senate seats vacated by retiring southern Democrats and George W. Bush improved his vote share compared to 2000 in every southern state except North Carolina - the home of his opponent's running mate.Why do Democrats struggle so mightily in the South? The reasons are many and include specific factors such as the historical absence of organized labor presence in the region as well as more general factors like a political tradition of stubborn contraposition to northern political attitudes. The short answer however is that social and cultural issues tend to trump economic considerations for many voters in the South where race and religion are woven through almost every aspect of the region's political culture. There are cultural conservatives outside the South and libertarian populists inside the region of course. But southerners hold distinctly conservative values and have long prided themselves for their obstinacy for resisting the social transformations unfolding elsewhere across America. What Thomas Frank laments has gone wrong in Kansas is even more wrong in the South where cultural issues weigh heavily in the minds of voters in America's poorest region.Against this backdrop of cultural conservatism political candidates running in all but a few isolated pockets of the South essentially must pass a values "litmus test." Stuart Brunson campaign manager for Tennessee's popular Democratic governor Phil Bredesen explained how it works. "Voters go through a two-step process" says Brunson. "The first is a credentialing filter which asks if a candidate shares their values. The second is on issues - education health care the economy." Howard Dean was roundly criticized during the 2004 Democratic primaries for openly referring to this phenomenon with his pithy "god guns and gays" tagline. The blue-blooded Vermont governor and future Democratic National Committee chair did not need to speak in folksy aphorisms to prove he understood the underlying dynamics of modern southern politics.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some believe the party must moderate its positions on social issues. The truth is that moderation is unlikely to assuage no less convert wary southern conservatives. Besides whatever small gains might come from abandoning support for reproductive choice or gay rights will likely be erased by the votes lost both inside and outside the South from projecting moral ambiguity. Frustrated Democrats tend to either avoid social issues altogether or worse make clumsy attempts at cultural contortionism. We are thus treated to campaign images of Al Gore wearing cowboy boots with his belt-clipped Blackberry or a barn jacket-clad John Kerry buying a goose hunting license. These hollow inauthentic gestures only accentuate and magnify the Democrats' cultural disconnect forcing liberals to avert their eyes in horror while conservatives look on from afar with a mixture of disdain and disbelief.Others think Democrats can bridge the cultural gap by emphasizing the destructive impacts of Republican economic policies. But it's extraordinarily difficult for Democratic candidates to differentiate themselves sufficiently on economic policies to compensate for the built-in advantages Republicans enjoy on social issues and post-NAFTA Democrats are having a hard time convincing many working-class voters that there is any meaningful differentiation at all. Besides no matter how attractive their economic messages may be Democrats must first pass through the "cultural credentialing" filter to get a full hearing from southerners on economic policy. The best Democrats can do is hope for fate to drop in their laps a huge electoral windfall like an economic collapse of such magnitude that it eliminates the culture filter or a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina that allows Democrats to play the incompetence card. This is neither a workable long-term strategy nor a noble way to run a political party.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIn theory the Democrats' economic messages ought to be embraced by working-class white and black southerners with equal gusto. Yet nowhere in America do people who come from similar economic stations vote so differently from one another. The self-comforting belief among Democrats that southerners vote against their interests is both condescending and false: White southerners are aware of their economic interests but simply assign more weight to social issues than economic ones and accordingly vote Republican; because they experience far less internal dissonance between the partisan implications of their cultural and economic preferences African Americans in the South vote Democratic. Consequently because white southerners far outnumber African Americans neither hedging on cultural issues nor highlighting economic policy differences - or even both approaches in conjunction - can save the Democrats in the South. The only task more difficult than crafting a series of economic ideas capable of convincing white southern conservatives to ignore their social values is persuading them that the Democratic Party shares those values in the first place.So why bother trying to leap the wide cultural chasm to reach them? Rather than superficial and mostly futile pandering to the nation's most conservative voters Democrats should begin to build a non-southern majority by unapologetically tailoring policies and targeting messages to more receptive audiences outside the South. Bowing and scraping to salvage a few southern votes here and there only leads to the sort of ideological schizophrenia that does little to improve the Democrats' southern fortunes and worse muddies the party's image outside the South.SISYPHEAN SOUTHERN SITUATIONThe Democrats' situation is exacerbated by two glaring political liabilities in the South. The first is that racial polarization has created a virtual Republican monopoly of the southern white vote that prevents Democrats from winning statewide races. The second is that religion plays a more prominent role in the South than in any other region.The central irony of southern politics is that the nation's most Republican region is home to half of all African Americans the Democratic party's most loyal voters. Unfortunately racial antagonisms exacerbate the Democrats' electoral problems in the South creating a white countermobilization - a "blacklash" so to speak - that fuels Republican victories. In the 2000 and 2004 elections many of George W. Bush's biggest wins came in southern states with the highest share of African Americans and some Democratic congressional candidates are capturing as little as 30 percent of the white vote in the South. By contrast the African-American vote in presidential elections and statewide contests is most successful for Democrats when it is part of multiethnic voting coalitions outside the South as it is in states such as Illinois Maryland Michigan New Jersey New York Ohio and Pennsylvania. Republicans have established a virtual monopoly on the white southern vote - and need to given the partisan head start Democrats enjoy by virtue of the size of the African-American populations in most southern states. Meanwhile as we will see later the Republicans have systematically diluted the power of African Americans by packing them into as few congressional and state legislative districts as possible. Unless the Democrats are prepared to abandon shamelessly their commitment to racial justice in order to win elections these realities do not suggest a Democratic revival in the South any time soon.Whereas secular electorates elsewhere are more likely to hold religion aside or even reject the interference of church into state matters the party's second liability is that churchgoing faithful are very skeptical of Democratic candidates. The partisan effects of southern piety are astounding. No region boasts a greater share of evangelicals than the South. According to surveys conducted by the University of North Carolina southerners are more likely than non-southerners to believe that God exists and answers prayers in the biblical account of creation and that people are sometimes possessed by the devil. A Pew Forum study conducted prior to the 2004 election by the University of Akron's John C. Green showed Democrats holding a narrow lead in partisan identification among Catholics and trailing only slightly among mainline Protestants but facing a 56 percent to 27 percent Republican edge among evangelical Christians. Evangelicals in the South are not merely more numerous but doctrinally and politically more conservative than non-southern evangelicals. Not surprising 2004 exit polls reported that nearly 4 in 5 self-described white evangelicals voted for George W. Bush. The top eighteen states in terms of their share of white evangelicals - which of course include every southern state - went for Bush. The evangelical chorus in the South wears red sings with a decidedly conservative tenor and votes righteously.Two partisan features of the South further diminish any hope that Democrats harbor about a regional resurgence.The first is the rising share of southerners who reached political maturity since Richard Nixon's successful use of the "southern strategy" in 1968. Born during the latter stages of the New Deal and coming of age after the Great Society this postboomer generation of southern Republicans share no familial or historical connection whatsoever to the New Deal-era Democratic Party. Southerners under the age of 50 in some states have never seen a Democrat capture their state's electoral votes. As tough as it may be to reconvert Republican seniors who once revered Franklin Roosevelt or supported Lyndon Johnson it will be even tougher to attract young southerners who associate the national Democratic Party with Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and have never cast a Democratic vote in their lives. . . .
 9,To the Editor:Your criticism of United States departure from the United Nations General Assembly during the speech by the Iranian president (Topics Sept. 24) misrepresents diplomatic practice and United Nations history. The walkout by Herbert S. Okun deputy United States representative leading the delegation was justified. It was Iran that broke the rules. Neither United Nations practice nor diplomatic convention requires a country to sit still for personal diatribes against its chief of state open threats of terrorism or appeals for the naked use of force. President Ali Khamenei did all of that and more.Further your comparison of the walkout to Soviet boycotts of the Security Council is incorrect. When the Russians walked out of the Security Council in 1950 they stopped participating in its work. The United States is participating fully in the work of the General Assembly. We returned to our seats as soon as the Iranian speech ended. FREDERICK NEGEM Counselor Press & Public Affairs New York Sept. 24 1987

 9,"That hearing is now up in the air" Samerjan said.Despite the promise held out by the talks the Devils nonetheless pressed their case yesterday that the authority had defaulted on their lease and thus provided the legal opening to leave on Thursday.The team claims 13 defaults including not sharing a $4 million payment from Harry M. Stevens the concessionaire and suspending its lease during the N.H.L. lockout. Lou Lamoriello the president of the Devils alleged in an affidavit that Mulcahy admitted that suspension was designed to deprive the Devils of "its pro rata share of suite revenues."Without citing Nashville by name the team scorned the authority's request for evidence of any talks between the Devils and any suitors. Even if the talks had occurred the team argued such legal discovery "would have a disruptive effect" and grant the authority "a seat at the negotiating table." The team added "The authority should not be permitted to rummage about in the alleged business negotiations."The team rebutted claims that moving would make it impossible to lure another hockey team or damage the public interest in light of the authority's skills in luring the Devils from Colorado and the Giants the Jets and the Nets from New York.The team argued that the authority "has never acted as if it believes the arguments it is now making."

 0,1 2 3 Martina Navratilova and Bob Bryan 6 6 10 Corina Morariu and Mike Bryan 7 4 4Martina Navratilova is almost 50. She wears a bandage on one knee. Her eyesight isn’t as good as it used to be (or the challenge reply is indeed having issues). Opponents actually hit at her. But when it really counts she can still pull it out. She and her partner Bob Bryan were facing Corina Morariu and Mike Bryan Bob’s twin and the other half of their top-ranked doubles team. After splitting the first two real sets they are locked in a champions tiebreak which substitutes for a third set in mixed doubles here. Ahead by 2-0 in the tiebreak Martina puts a makeable volley into the net. At 3-1 Bob seems in command of the point after returning Corina’s second serve. But Martina raises her hand to challenge the serve saying she can see the mark out. As Safin could attest a mark isn’t always a mark. The replay shows the ball has nicked both lines. They automatically lose the point.Now Martina and Bob are ahead by 5-4. She is standing in the deuce court as a crosscourt exchange whisks by her left ear. She expects and produces a crisp crosscourt backhand volley too sharp for Corina and landing in the middle of the doubles alley before flying off the court. It was the kind of shot that would have toppled over the pyramid of tennis balls that teaching pros are so fond of placing at angles of the court. Martina and Bob are again in control and he follows with an ace to put them ahead by 7-4. They never lose another point in the tiebreak and advanced to play another day. Sadly this mixed doubles partnership is scheduled for a breakup. This is the last Open in Navratilova’s exemplary and storied career one that will be remembered for her titles the heart on her sleeve where her endorsement patches should have been and that vintage backhand volley.
 0,PhotoPARISOnly in the spontaneous high-energy environment of Opening Ceremony the retail temple dedicated to of-this-moment street style that started on Howard Street in New York nearly a decade ago does it make any kind of sense that a pair of self-proclaimed mall kids from the suburbs of Los Angeles would wind up at the design helm of a Parisian fashion house.On Sunday the founders of the store Humberto Leon and Carol Lim both 36 will present their first collection for Kenzo the label that became a cultural touchstone here in the 1970s when it was founded by Kenzo Takada a young designer from Japan. Their show is scheduled between those of Hermès and Givenchy.To give you an idea of how drastically different their approach to French fashion is likely to be here is what the Kenzo atelier on the Rue Vivienne looked like earlier this week: Mr. Leon and Ms. Lim were sitting in a cramped makeshift office with a large white sculpture of a rabbit peering in at them through an open window. They showed a little animated video that transformed the Kenzo logo into a moving runway with dancing flowers and fireworks. Assistants were showing them samples saying things like “Très cute right?”With 125 employees at Opening Ceremony stores in Tokyo and Los Angeles their own collection a showroom and fast-moving collaborations with designers around the world Mr. Leon and Ms. Lim have created the defining retail concept of their generation. They see they sample they consume fashion like locusts they instinctually move on to whatever’s next.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyTheir surprise appointment at Kenzo — they speak hardly any French; neither had studied fashion when they met as undergraduates at the University of California Berkeley in the mid-1990s — represents a new willingness of French fashion to be experimental as well. Rather than putting on a formal runway show Mr. Leon and Ms. Lim are having a party with “runway moments” in various rooms of the atelier that have been painted in bright blue or red. The actor Jason Schwartzman is in charge of the music. The designs are meant to be more democratic and less expensive than in Kenzo’s recent past since it has been under the ownership of the luxury conglomerate LVMH and designed most recently by Antonio Marras.

 9,o the Editor:''Guns in the House'' (editorial May 27) suggests that Congress mandate ''smart gun'' technology to deter teen-agers from obtaining firearms. But if Congress wants to get serious about keeping guns away from teen-agers and criminals it must pass comprehensive legislation that would supervise the manufacture distribution and sale of guns.What works for cars can work for guns. Without registration and licensing of cars and drivers authorized dealerships manufacturing and design specifications and owner's liability insurance door locks alone would not deter under-age or criminal use of automobiles. One-car-a-month isn't an issue for most Americans because of the costs involved with owning a car. Congress must regulate the gun industry to keep children or criminals away from guns.KATINA JOHNSTONENew York May 27 1999The writer is a board member of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence.

 9,"I bought it in a large amount initially expecting it to sell because the Elton John single is already out" said Lal Sarju the store's soundtrack buyer referring to "Can You Feel the Love Tonight." "But when the movie comes out I expect to sell a couple hundred pieces a week."Buyers at record and toy stores agree sales of the soundtrack will probably be sluggish until the movie opens but they're hoping airplay and the pre-release hype will help. "There's already been a lot of anticipation" Lew Garrett the vice president of purchasing for the 430-store chain Camelot Music said. "I think it has the potential to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. We certainly bought it that way." Beastie Boys With MonksThe Beastie Boys were the last band anyone expected to get political. The hip-hop trio's first full-length album "Licensed to Ill" in 1986 was a boy's night out crammed with tales of drinking and partying. Their most recent album "Ill Communication" (Grand Royal/Capitol) released yesterday sounds more like the morning after. It's sleepy and sprawling heavy and reflective. "The earth needs to be respected" Adam Yauch (a k a MCA) raps on "The Update." "It's been far too long that she's been neglected."On Friday night at the Academy the Beastie Boys -- Michael Diamond (Mike D) Adam Horovitz (King Adrock) and Mr. Yauch -- put their money where their mouths are. The surprise performance announced the day of the show was a benefit for Artists for Tibet a national campaign to preserve Tibetan culture. Also on the bill were Luscious Jackson a female punk funk and hip-hop quartet that includes the former Beastie Boys drummer Kate Schellenbach and the Tibetan Ganden Jangtse Monks."I don't think most of our audience has ever seen something like the monks" Mr. Yauch 29 said from his parents' home in Brooklyn hours before the show "and I definitely don't think the monks have ever seen the kind of insanity that goes on at our concerts before. Hopefully it will run smoothly. The main thing we're hoping to do with the concert is bring about some more awareness about what's happening in Tibet especially among younger people."

 9,CLASSICAL Copland: 'Appalachian Spring' Suite 'Short Symphony' and Other Works Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 335; CD and cassette. Copland originally wrote ''Appalachian Spring'' for 13 instruments all that could fit in the pit for the 1944 premiere of the Martha Graham ballet - a version he suppressed once the suite for full orchestra caught on. With his concise and rhythmically exciting ''Short Symphony'' (1933) he did something of the reverse; since it proved too difficult for many orchestras he made a sextet setting which we are likelier to encounter. Here are variants on both originals - the ''Spring'' Suite in a chamber orchestration (the 13 instruments plus extra strings) the symphony in a chamber orchestra reduction devised by Dennis Russell Davies - along with chamber orchestra renditions of ''Quiet City'' and ''Three Latin American Sketches.'' Orpheus plays with verve if not an especially original point of view. In DG's recording close and striking the ''Short Symphony'' is a real grabber. - Mark Swed Richard Strauss: 'Aus Italien' Four Orchestral Songs Felicity Lott soprano (Songs); Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi. Chandos 8744; all three formats. Like Mendelssohn and Berlioz before and Elgar after him Richard Strauss knew how to capture his glowing youthful Italian impressions in music. The designation ''Symphonic Fantasy'' fits the early ''Aus Italien'' (1886) well. Those who tend to dismiss it as a ''travelogue'' because of its symphonic elaboration of the familiar ''Funiculi Funicula'' in the final movement are bound to overlook the subtleties and splendid colors of the preceding three - particularly the third movement (''On the Shores of Sorrento'') which points ahead to later Strauss. The performance apparently the first on CD is vigorously led by Neeme Jarvi and save for a tremulous oboe solo well played. The songs - ''Winterweihe'' ''Mein Auge'' ''Der Rosenband'' and ''Befreit'' rapturous utterances in radiant orchestral settings - are faultlessly sung by Felicity Lott. - George Jellinek 'New Music Series' Vol. 1: Works by Korde Lippe Mabry Risset Rubin Scelsi and Xenakis Robert Black double bass; Walter van Hawe alto recorder; Mel Cuthbertson tuba; Holy Cross Chamber Players conducted by Toshimasa Francis Wada. Neuma CD 450-71; CD only. Neuma a label based in Acton Mass. offers seven recent works in a sampler reminiscent of the new-music collections the major labels offered in the 1960's; indeed a 60's avant-garde esthetic pervades the disk. Most enjoyable are two electronic pieces. Jean-Claude Risset's ''Contours'' a tactile and sometimes spacily atmospheric work is a study in thematic transformation; and Anna Rubin's ''Crying the Laughing and Golden'' uses the sound of laughter and whispering to create an evocative intensely emotional soundscape. Interesting too are the glittering variegated ''Chamber Piece'' by Shirish Korde and Drake Mabry's ''12.5.83'' a fleet virtuosic essay for alto recorder. - Allan Kozinn Mendelssohn: Concertos in D minor: for Violin and Strings; for Violin Piano and Strings Gidon Kremer violin; Martha Argerich piano; Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 338; CD and cassette. It's in just this sort of peripheral repertory which requires first-rate performances to make it at all effective that we've too often had to settle for well-meant mediocrity. Nothing of the sort here as two supreme virtuosos admirably supported by the conductorless Orpheus ensemble throw their formidable artistic weight into impetuous committed and compelling performances of two seldom-heard works Mendelssohn composed at ages 13 and 14. Even given such high-powered treatment the Violin Concerto of 1822 cannot rival its famous E minor counterpart of 1844 in formal concision or lyrical refinement but both youthful works emerge here as strong vibrant creations fully worthy of broader exposure in such top-flight performances. - James R. Oestreich Davis: 'The Silents: Musical Scores for Classic Silent Films' London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Carl Davis. Virgin Classics 7 90785; CD and cassette. This music is the sort that makes the snobs shout ''derivative.'' Let them shout. They'll take nothing away from Carl Davis's gifts as a composer of memorable Hollywood music in the grand old tradition - eclectic but always expressive of the dramatic situation and handled with consummate flair. Sometimes Mr. Davis adapts existing music - Gottschalk tunes and traditional Chinese melodies for ''Broken Blossoms'' hunks of ''Scheherazade'' for ''The Thief of Baghdad.'' But such original material as ''The Eagle of Destiny'' for ''Napoleon'' the Garbo theme for ''Flesh and the Devil'' and the nightmarish Prokofievian cyclone music in ''The Wind'' stand securely on their own. The London Philharmonic plays well and Virgin offers good sound. - Barrymore L. Scherer POP/JAZZ Jefferson Airplane: 'Jefferson Airplane' Epic 45271; all three formats. Reunited after 17 years the Jefferson Airplane still sounds like a collection of quarrelsome bohemians with eccentric interests. ''Summer of Love'' Marty Balin's eulogy to the hippie dream is the likeliest hit. Paul Kantner's ''Planes'' exalts the Freudian implications of air travel. Grace Slick's ''Panda'' pleads for the salvation of the species from extinction and her ''Common Market Madrigal'' compares erotic love with European tourism. The portentous political anthem ''Solidarity'' lists Bertolt Brecht as one of its collaborators and the mystical ''Wheel'' proclaims ''From the heart of the volcano the future is born.'' With all its windy blather and quirkiness the album sounds too fresh to seem a cynical cashing-in on nostalgia. - Stephen Holden Archie Brownlee and the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi: 'You Done What the Doctor Couldn't Do' Gospel Jubilee RF-1402 (Down Home Records 10341 San Pablo Ave. El Cerrito Calif. 94530); LP only. The best tracks on this anthology taken from 1948 through 1959 achieve the forward motion of a hurtling train the deep intensity of the best art. Archie Brownlee one of hard gospel's most influential singers had a voice that could balloon at the end of a phrase turn from velvet to crushed rock on a syllable. The group which began at the Piney Woods School for blind children in Mississippi cushions Mr. Brownlee's expeditions into passion with purring organlike chords occasionally backed by guitar and drums. But it's Mr. Brownlee's voice gashing through the accompaniment signifying a man caught up in the passion of belief that makes these numbers work. - Peter Watrous 'Siya Hamba: 1950's South African Country and Small Town Sounds' Original Music OMA 111 (R. D. 1 Box 190 Lasher Road Tivoli N. Y. 12583); LP only. While recent commercial recordings from South Africa have lately been reaching the United States ''Siya Hamba'' is a find - a glimpse into the urban and rural music of the 1950's. The urban music on side two shows how South Africans assimilated big-band pop and jump-blues; the music uses suave jazzy harmony choruses behind powerful lead singers whose melodies still have traditional shapes. But the rural music on side one recorded in the countryside is the revelation. Using imported instruments like harmonica concertina autoharp or guitar in place of previous generations' traditional instruments the music is raw rhythmic and utterly joyous with shouting laughing audiences to prove it. - Jon Pareles Rhonda Clark: 'Between Friends' Tabu; all three formats. Ms. Clark has a pinched tight voice that can get nasty painted with touches of Dinah Washington or Esther Phillips's nasal tone. This is good as her sound introduces a touch of reality into tunes heavy with ethereal synthesizer colors and distant thumping bass lines. Recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios in Minneapolis and partially produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (the movers behind Janet Jackson among others) Ms. Clark's debut album has the producer's special sound clean full of puffs of music and overdubbed voices. When she improvises screaming through the breaks in the production on ''The Way You Are'' it's obvious she's something special. - P. W.
 0,Ms. Hansen-Love observes the vagaries of Nathalie’s situation with compassion and lucidity. Her films — this is her fourth feature — often turn on intimate calamities like a husband’s suicide (in “Father of My Children”) or a painful breakup (in “Goodbye First Love”). But she is temperamentally allergic to melodrama and far less interested in the easy shocks and tidy consolations of plot than in the meandering almost random texture of lived experience. The French title of “Things to Come” (it’s also the name of an old British science-fiction movie) is “L’Avenir” which more literally means “the future” and which more accurately conveys the film’s open-ended exploratory structure.It also might stand as an admission of the filmmaker’s personal perspective on the story she is telling. Ms. Hansen-Love is 35 and the future she imagines is in some measure her own. Middle age is a landscape that is especially difficult for young people to picture and one that they often ignore. It looks so sad so boring so scary and the people who live there tend to be so weird and self-conscious. Ms. Hansen-Love surveys the territory with clear eyes but also with an unmistakable shading of pity and with ideas in particular about Nathalie’s sexuality and the political compromises of her generation that seem more like assumptions than insights.If Ms. Hansen-Love’s film overcomes these limitations it’s because of Ms. Huppert whose best performances often feel like dialogues — or outright arguments — with her directors. In a recent article in The New Republic the critic Miriam Bale has described the way Ms. Huppert in Paul Verhoeven’s “Elle” — a film about a Parisian woman of a certain age that is as lurid and aggressive as this one is calm and thoughtful — assumes control over the character and her story. “Her performance is a clear case of actress as auteur” Ms. Bale writes an observation that strikes me as at least partly true in the case of “Things to Come.”Traveling from Paris to the countryside (where Fabien and some friends have set up a sort of anarchist commune) Nathalie finds herself both freer than she used to be and constrained by norms and expectations of which she had been only partly aware. Her identity has come unraveled and she needs to figure out how to put together a new one at once an ideal and an especially difficult project for a philosopher. It is also of course what actors do all the time but almost never with Ms. Huppert’s combination of unbridled instinct and absolute control. Nathalie reinvents herself before our eyes and we believe what we see because Ms. Huppert is doing it too.

 9,At the urging of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani New York City hotel owners and their union workers agreed yesterday to continue negotiating into the holiday weekend and to put off a strike or lockout at least until midnight on Tuesday.The collective bargaining agreement between the Hotel Association of New York City which is representing 79 of its member hotels in the talks and the 22000-member New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council expired last night. Union members -- bellhops waiters bartenders room attendants and others -- voted earlier this week in favor of a strike called by union leaders against any or all of the association's hotels.Many association hotels had agreed to lock out their union workers should a strike be called against any one of them.Talks had been stalled for several days. After intense discussions late last week progress was reported but on Monday the union president and chief negotiator Vito Pitta walked out of a session because of a dispute. The focus was the hotels' desire for greater leeway in attracting independent concessionaires to run restaurants and other services within the hotels.

 0,BY pointing readers to the Web's newest and best bits Web logs offer a way to cut through online clutter. But now that there are millions of blogs what was once a solution to the information glut has started to become part of the problem. So perhaps inevitably sites and services have popped up that add another level to the information food chain by digesting the Web digests.The latest such site Kinja is scheduled to open to the public today at www.kinja.com. The site automatically compiles digests of blogs covering subject areas like politics and baseball. Short excerpts from the blogs are included with links to the complete entries on the individual blog sites. After signing up for a free account with Kinja users can enter the addresses of their favorite blogs and generate a digest -- a customized blog of blogs.The site is designed for people who may have heard about Web logs but are not sure how to start reading them said Nick Denton Kinja's president whose small blog-publishing empire includes the New York gossip site Gawker (gawker.com).''Everyone has this illusion that Web logs have taken the world by storm'' Mr. Denton said ''but Web logs have probably only reached 10 percent of the Internet population. Our goal is to reach the remainder.''
 0,Carolyn Brown’s rich account of 20 years of dancing with Merce Cunningham and John Cage “Chance and Circumstance” provides an insider’s portrait of two pioneering modernists who ventured into uncharted territory in the realm of dance and music. Brown vividly evokes the thrills and struggles inherent to true liberation and describes the courage requisite to artistic inventiveness. She is a rare memoirist who focuses on her mentors’ physical and spiritual leaps rather than on herself; her guileless revelations illuminate what went right and wrong in Cunningham and Cage’s personal dealings as well as in their fight for survival.Brown first saw Cunningham dance when she took a master class with him in 1951:“He was slender and tall with a long spine long neck and sloping shoulders; a bit pigeonbreasted. There was a lightness of the upper body which contrasted with the solid legs so beautifully shaped and the heavy massive feet. … I remember Merce most clearly demonstrating a fall that began with him rising onto three-quarter point in parallel position swiftly arching back like a bow as he raised his left arm overhead and sinking quietly to the floor on his left hand curving his body over his knees rising on his knees to fall flat out like a priest at the foot of the cross rolling over quickly and arriving on his feet again in parallel position — all done with such speed and elegance suppressed passion and catlike stealth that my imitative dancer’s mind was caught short. I could not repeat it. I could only marvel at what I hadn’t really seen. His dancing was airborne. … Merce Cunningham had an appetite for dancing that seemed to me then as it does today to be his sole reason for living. … He was a strange disturbing mixture of Greek god panther and madman.”Only another dancer could capture Cunningham’s extraordinary physical prowess dexterity and deliberate emotional abandon. And only someone with Brown’s intrinsic personal modesty and generous spirit could be so trenchant about the man who has enchanted but plagued her from then until now.The book follows Cunningham’s company from its formative years in squalid conditions to glamorous world tours. Unwilling to settle for clichés Brown questions the notion that Cunningham got his ideas for dance movements by watching people on the street from a high window. She maintains that Cunningham’s work has more meaning and depends less on chance than he often admitted. Similarly she does not hesitate to claim that George Balanchine resorted to “daisy-chain contortionist acrobatics” and “girlie-show kitsch” when choreographing to modern composers like Schoenberg and Ives teetering on “the Mickey Mouse-‘Fantasia’ aesthetic” in what the public perceives as undisputed masterworks. Right or wrong Brown writes with the courage and conviction of a true devotee.PhotoShe rounds out the portraits of her characters by depicting them as the children of their parents. John Cage’s taste for the unconventional was in his genes. The year Cage was born 1912 his father invented a submarine run by a gasoline engine (worthless to the government since enemy ships could detect its location from the bubbles produced); John Milton Cage Sr. also devised an alcohol-based panacea for all woes and patented a wall-size television projection system. However creative Cage Sr. was though when his son’s “Suite by Chance” was first performed in the 1950s he and Carolyn Brown’s father said “they both made better music in the ‘water closet.’” Cage’s and Brown’s mothers were offended by electronic blasts that they felt deliberately imitated human wind during a plié; in fact Brown says “the flatulent sound … occurred completely by chance and took Merce (and the composer!) by surprise.” Brown’s parents wept after seeing the large Robert Rauschenberg painting for which her husband had paid $26 believing their son-in-law might be mentally ill. Cunningham’s mother Mayne appears when the company spends a Thanksgiving holiday in the choreographer’s hometown Centralia Wash. Mayne brings out Wilhelmina a floppy lifesize “girl-doll” whose shoes are still attached to the larger shoes that young Merce wore when doing a ballroom act with her.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBrown is on surer ground discussing dance — her métier — than painting where she is an outsider attracted to apparent novelty and too readily prizes theory over craft. She knowingly positions Cunningham in relation to Martha Graham and Antony Tudor but when she writes about Jasper Johns and Rauschenberg she lacks equivalent perspective neglecting the pivotal role of Kurt Schwitters and Hans Arp and other predecessors of these American artists who have enjoyed such disproportionate celebrity and absurdly high market values. Brown would have done better to exercise the independence with which she evaluates the big names of dance.

 9,On Dec. 18 Ha Van Lau said:“If the United States declares the total and unconditional withdrawal from South Vietnam of its troops and those of the other foreign countries in the U.S. camp within a six‐month period the parties will discuss the timetable of the withdrawal of these troops and the question of Insuring the safety for such troop withdrawal.”In this same statement he said that once the above re quirement is fulfilled the vari ous forces for peace in Vietnam “will enter into talks to set up a provisional coalition govern ment. ...” Seemingly Hanoi expects the latter to happen; it does not have to be negotiated at Paris.What might all this mean?1. For the first time Hanoi has told us how to meet the “total and unconditional with drawal” requirement—by an nouncing it publicly.2. The key to the announce ment is the certainty that by specified date all of our troops will be withdrawn.3. While Hanoi says six months this could be read as a bargaining gambit. Xuan Thuy said that the U.S. “must accept the principle of withdrawal then put it into practice” and that some U.S. forces could re main in South Vietnam even as late as the elections to be con ducted by the provisional coali tion government.4. Hanoi's “total and uncon ditional” phrase remains rais ing the question as to what we might get in return for our withdrawal announcement. Ha noi hacked away from this same phrase in October 1968. When we stopped the bombing Hanoi accepted the condition that the Government of South Vietnam be seated in Paris along with the National Liberation Front as part of a your‐side‐our‐side ar rangement. We also assumed and had reason to believe that Hanoi understood that it should “not take advantage” of our bombing cessation by shelling major cities and by abusing the DMZ. To a degree Hanoi has lived up to our assumption of “no advantage.”This past experience is sug gestive of what we could ask from Hanoi now. Politically we might extract the condition that Hanoi and the N.L.F. agree to talk with the Government of Vietnam about political settle ment. Militarily we could give Hanoi to understand that we expect its forces in the South to he reduced accordingly the level of military activity to de cline and require the return of all American POW's.

 0,Even the presidential debates are such a throwback to the Eisenhower era that the networks might as well broadcast them in black and white. The PBS anchor Jim Lehrer was not chosen to moderate all three presidential contests as he has been in the past. He was assigned only the first debate in Florida. The next two will be presided over by other aging white males: Charles Gibson of ABC and Bob Schieffer of CBS the only two network news anchors who make Mr. Lehrer seem kooky. (Gwen Ifill who is female and black will moderate the less important vice presidential debate.)This season no new sitcoms are centered on a female character. NBC has a "Friends" spinoff "Joey" starring Matt LeBlanc; ABC has "Rodney" based on the good-old-boy humor of the country-western comic Rodney Carrington; and CBS has "Center of the Universe" starring John Goodman -- without Roseanne Barr. HBO always a trendsetter introduced a no-girls-allowed series this summer "Entourage" about a young Hollywood actor and his posse that was one long admittedly funny bachelor party.Meanwhile comedy-variety shows are positively reveling in their new-found freedom to be unfair.The jokes at comedy roasts are almost always disparaging on the basis of race creed or sex but until recently networks tried to sit up straight during the family hour. NBC's "Last Comic Standing" lets amateur stand-up comedians vent the kind of material at 8 p.m. that is usually left to late-hour improv nights in comedy clubs. On a recent episode the contenders taunted a heavy-set black female contestant with weight and race jokes. (One said she could not eat Tootsie Rolls because she might bite off her own fingers.)Not surprisingly then strong female characters are also having a dry spell on the new season's dramas. The networks have no new police series like "Cold Case" or "Crossing Jordan" this fall. The only new hard-boiled female detective is a high school student Veronica Mars on UPN. Heather Locklear shares top billing with Blair Underwood on NBC's airport drama "LAX" but bless her heart she is still more bimbo than Rambo.The antifeminist mood is widespread particularly on reality shows like "The Apprentice" and "Wife Swap" where single career women are cute and flirty and married women do housework. But it is most noticeable on sitcoms because it was not long ago that the genre was dominated by strong funny women and especially by strong funny women who made fun of men from "Roseanne" and "Murphy Brown" to "Ally McBeal" and "Sex and the City."

 9,All of their garlic is organic as is the rocambole variety grown by Keith Stewart at Keith's Farm in Greenville N.Y. in western Orange County. He sells all of it at the Union Square Greenmarket. ''It's frightening what they spray on garlic'' Mrs. Nosonowitz said.This is the peak of the garlic season. Growers in the Northeast have harvested their crop and have either just finished curing it or will soon. They hang the garlic by its leaves for several weeks under controlled temperatures and humidity with fans blowing to dry it. After the garlic is trimmed and cleaned it is sorted according to size and variety and placed in string bags which are hung from the same rafters. From July to November mature garlic is at its best.If this local garlic is stored properly -- in a cool dry place in a string bag or garlic keeper -- it will last until February and be better than anything the supermarket has to offer which is commercially grown garlic that has come from thousands of miles away. Almost 90 percent of the garlic sold in this country comes from California.One of the biggest differences between local and California garlic is the basic variety: the former is hardneck which sends up a central stalk and is more tolerant of colder climates; California's is softneck which has a very small central stem.Chester Aaron who grows 87 kinds of garlic in Sonoma County Calif. and is the author of ''The Great Garlic Book'' (Ten Speed Press 1997) is partial to hardneck garlic. He said commercial farmers prefer the softneck because it is easier to grow produces greater yields is less labor intensive and lasts longer. But most softneck garlic has smaller cloves that are more difficult to peel and many insist tastes harsher. (It doesn't help that it is older when it gets here.)Hardneck garlic Mr. Aaron said ''has a span of tastes that is far wider than softneck. Whenever I do a tasting I will put out both and people's response is always that the hardneck is far superior.''The differences were certainly clear when Mrs. Nosonowitz sat me down to taste her freshly minced products offered on a spoon. She started me off with her favorite Prussian White also known as Music. It was pungent with a pleasing aftertaste. Then we moved on to Italian rocambole somewhat gentler than the Prussian but still pungent.

 9,The premonition that a new kind of Hindu politics will sooner or later threaten the religious harmony of the pious but nonviolent South is just below the surface in many conversations. Trivandrum the Kerala state capital is not only a city where churches and mosques seem more numerous and prosperous than temples; it is also the seat of a state government dominated by secular Communists.Communism is in flux and so in a different sense is Hinduism. But if the left is searching for new policies the religious right -- led by the Bharatiya Janata Party which brought down the Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh by withdrawing its support for him in the dispute over the Ayodhya temple -- has already found its direction."Until now the B.J.P. has not been as strong here as it has been in the north" said B. Rameshkumar a political analyst for Mathrubhumi a Malayalam-language newspaper. "Mostly upper-caste Hindus used to join. But now young people of all castes seem to be attracted. In fact we don't really know what areas the B.J.P. may be cutting into. In Kerala people would not want to reveal religious prejudices because they always want to appear cultured."Bharatiya Janata leaders are coming south with a powerful pitch: Hinduism they say is the truly Indian way of life. The polity they call Hindutva would cut across caste and region and unite all Indians -- 85 percent of whom are Hindus -- in one spiritual fold. Yet India which is a constitutionally secular nation has a population of 840 million that includes about 12 percent Muslim and 2 percent Sikh as well as other small religious minorities.In Hindutva those minorities -- half the population in Kerala state -- would be free to coexist once they accept the majority view of the nation Hindu militants say. The lower castes would be discouraged from thinking of themselves as separate entities -- a clear attempt by the Bharatiya Janata Party and more zealous groups to undercut efforts by other politicians to organize the disadvantaged to improve their lot.

 9,HACKENSACK N.J. May 2—A former Riverdell Hospital doctor testified today at the murder trial of Dr Mario E. Jascalevich that cn the morning of Sept. 25 1966 he saw Dr. Jascalevich attempting to revive a dying patient with an ineffective method of resuscitation.The witness. Dr. Frank A. Grosso said Dr. Jascalevich was pressing lightly on the patient's chest with the tips of his fingers “which I thought was quite unusual.” He testified that the patient was blue and motionless and that he went to the patient's bedside and offered to help but got no response from Dr. Jascalevich.“He just walked away and left the room” Dr. Grosso testified.The patient was Emma M. Arzt who died later that day and is one of the five patients Dr. Jascalevich is accused Of murdering at the hospital in Oradell in 1965 and 1966 by secretly giving them lethal doses of the drug curare.Dr. Jascalevich is charged with killing the patients of other doctors to discredit colleagues who he thought were challenging his authority. The defense contends Dr. Jascalevich was framed with the curare charges by inept doctors seeking an explanation for the sudden deaths at the hospital that were the result of their own mistakes.
 0,Two columns in the June 30 issue of Wine Spectator provide a fascinating counterpoint in one of the most important aesthetic arguments in wine today. The first by James Laube one of the Spectator’s senior editors takes a swipe at those who complain about the high alcohol content in many of today’s wines. “If you taste a wine and it seems to be balanced’’ Laube writes “the alcohol content shouldn’t matter.’’That’s the standard retort from the high-alcohol apologists and it’s not really what makes the column interesting though it lets you know where Laube stands. No what makes the column worth reading is his point that high alcohol levels are a necessary tradeoff for “plush wines with loads of flavor body texture and depth.’’“For many of us more alcohol is an acceptable price for rich flavorful front-loaded wines that are engagingly complex and ready to drink the day you buy them’’ he writes. He does allow that he would prefer wines in the 13.5 percent range as in Bordeaux rather than at the 15 to 17 percent level that many California wines are currently hitting. “However in many other parts of the world including California many wines made at more moderate alcohol levels don’t have much flavor and reds are often too tannic’’ he says.Now I have to take issue with that last statement. My problem with many of the higher-alcohol wines particularly those from California is that they are overbearing. Too much flavor. Too jammy. Too sweet-tasting. Too powerful. Too plush. They taste the same and they don’t go with food. If you are used to eating steaks slathered with ketchup mayonnaise and all manner of secret sauce an unadorned steak may seem devoid of flavor – until you get used to eating that way again and your taste buds recover their appreciation for subtlety and nuance. To put it another way a marching band will always outblast a piano trio and if you are accustomed only to marching bands you may not appreciate the trio.Let’s be clear: Few people find high alcohol desirable in a wine. Some people find it a serious flaw. Others like James Laube tolerate it because they enjoy the big rich style of these wines. But to suggest that it’s necessary in California rather than a stylistic decision on the part of the winemaker is plain wrong. Laube as much as says so himself. “We’re living through a phase one of those periods where it’s fashionable to make the most expressive wine possible and that will change’’ he writes “expressive’’ being a euphemism for big.On that last point I happen to agree with him. In the last five years or so the pendulum has swung for California chardonnays. Of course the tropical fruit oak and buttered popcorn wines that were the defining style of the 1990’s are still widely available but many winemakers have come back to leaner less extravagant more Chablis-like chardonnays. They have backed away from power and toward finesse. I think 10 years from now we’ll see the same thing happening with red wines.By the way while I don’t care for many high-alcohol wines I don’t reject all of them. Many Châteauneuf-du-Papes exceed 15 percent and some of them are great. I’ve enjoyed some big California pinot noirs and zinfandels. And last year I wrote about Diatom a chardonnay from the Santa Rita Hills that was captivating despite its 16.2 percent alcohol. But on the whole I think balanced high-alcohol wines are fairly rare.A colleague of James Laube’s Matt Kramer has certainly spoken up for finesse in the past and in his column in this edition of the Spectator he asks the rhetorical question “Has pinot noir become boring?’’Kramer who is always one of the most thought-provoking wine writers examines the uniformity of many New World pinot noirs and points at the narrow selections of clones planted in many new pinot noir vineyards. Now I know discussion of clonal selections is a guaranteed turnoff for many wine lovers but I’ll ask your forbearance because I think Kramer’s point is important. The various versions of the popular Dijon clones all emphasize certain red and black fruit flavors which produce a powerful sameness rather than the complexity that might result from mixing together other clones of pinot noir.I’ve had the opportunity to taste wines made of different clones of pinot noir grown in the same vineyard and the differences can be astonishing. I remember one tasting session at the Hirsch Vineyards on the Sonoma Coast. David Hirsch poured wine made from a Pommard clone which had great acidity and vibrant fruit as well as a slight herbaceousness and an elegance. Then a wine from the Mount Eden clone which had a distinct raspberry flavor and a different Mount Eden clone which had a bright brilliant cherry flavor. Then a Swan selection which was dry structured and powerful with complex fruit and herbal flavors. Dijon clones seemed powerful too but with less dimension. The best wine of all was made from the various clones blended together.Kramer also addresses the important question of ripeness which he calls “the single most important aesthetic decision today.’’“Just when a grape is deemed ‘ripe’ has changed dramatically in the past decade’’ he writes. “This has resulted not only in more alcoholically powerful wines but in more uniform-tasting ones too. When a grape gets overripe it loses its more subtle flavor shadings.’’Exactly what I’ve been saying thank you. What’s especially disturbing is that pinot noir excels at making thrillingly subtle wines of great nuance. Instead we’re getting what Laube approvingly describes as “dark opulent New World cabernet or pinot noir brimming with broad rich flavors and smooth fleshy tannins.’’Jeez do we really want to lump cabernet and pinot noir together like that? My guess is Kramer would say absolutely not.I have to compliment the Spectator for publishing Laube and Kramer practically on adjoining pages in the magazine. Both men are far too gentlemanly to take a swipe at one another but if you close your eyes you can almost feel them throwing elbows back and forth.
 9,LONDON Sept. 30—The calm of Britain's general election campaign was shattered today when Harold Wilson voiced Labor party suspicions that a strike in the vital automobile industry was politically motivated to damage Labor's chances in the voting two weeks from tomorrow.Mr. Wilson the party leader followed this up tonight with a major campaign speech in which he charged the Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas ‐ Home with “one of the most fatuous deceptions ever” in contending that Britain's economy “has seldom if ever been stronger.”Referring to yesterday's official figures showing that Britain spent £256 million ($716.8 million) more than she earned in the first half of 1964 Mr. Wilson said the economy had been kept going only by borrowing heavily from the British Commonwealth and more recently from New York.‘Crawling’ to U.S. Scored“Not content with crawling to the Americans and. becoming dependent on them for a weapon they regard as vital Sir Alec and his colleagues are putting us in pawn economically” the Labor leader charged.

 9,If the United States is going to intervene militarily in Haiti it should do so soon. Prolonging the sanctions (even the new improved version) when they are causing such hardship for ordinary Haitians while at the same time having so little impact on the renegade Government is both cruel and indefensible.President Clinton has spelled out why he feels the United States has a special interest in Haiti and why the use of force to restore President Aristide is being considered. Haiti is "in our backyard" Mr. Clinton said and it is the only country in the Western Hemisphere in which the military has seized power from an elected leader. Haiti and Cuba are the only two countries in the hemisphere that are not democratic.President Clinton also noted that if democracy was not restored to Haiti the United States at some point would face an enormous surge of new refugees seeking to settle here. (Keeping those refugees out has been the cornerstone of American policy to date.) Other points of special interest according to Mr. Clinton include the thousands of Americans who live in Haiti and the one million Haitian-Americans who live here. Finally there is the fact that Haiti has become a staging area for drug shipments to the United States.Mr. Clinton did not mention the important role the United States Government has played in the exploitation of the Haitian people. This has occurred through U.S. Government support -- both direct and covert -- for a series of repressive regimes and through the long-term exploitation of cheap Haitian labor by American businesses. The U.S. has an interest in acknowledging those abuses and in making the effort to act as a friend rather than an oppressor of the Haitian people.The military in Haiti believes it has won its battle of the wills with the United States. "Sometimes" said an American diplomat "the military leaders believe we were never serious about restoring Aristide and other times they think we may have been serious but lacked the will. Either way they have felt triumphant."

 9,In his five‐page opinion Justice Murtagh made a passing reference to the methods employed in the Rao case. Justice Murtagh did not have to comment because as in the cases of Irving Goldman the city's former Cultural Affairs Commissioner and Alvin Geller a formen bureau chief in the Manhattan District Attorney's office he had decided to dismiss the indictments on more fundamental grounds.At issue the justice said was whether the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the offense charged. The justice found that when “Mr. Vitale” whose real name he disclosed and the undercover woman agent testified before Mr. Nadjari's grand jury they gave statements to the panel that were “highly prejudicial to the defendants.”Prosecutors in Mr. Nadjari's office familiar with the Rao case said the “opinions” given were necessary to establish a “fact pattern” that showed the perjurious statements of the defendants.Justice Murtagh also criticized Michael Brown the assistant attorney general handling the grand jury for asking “leading questions” of the two undercover agents. The answers the agents gave the justice said consisted of “mere affirmations or denials of the prosecutor's questions.”“There was not even a pretence at compliance with the rules of evidence” he added.Following is the text of the statement issued yesterday by Mr. Nadjari:The public interest is not being served by the apparent and continuing hostility of Judge Murtagh to my efforts to carry out the Governor's mandate in his superceding order to investigate and prosecute all corruption in the criminal‐justice system.Therefore for the first time I will speak out on the role played by Judge Murtagh.Prior judicial consent was obtained by this office from Judge Murtagh before proceeding with the undercover activity in the Rao case for which I have been so severely criticized. Judge Murtagh was asked for his permission in writing. He declined. He gave memoral permission. The judge added that: ‘Using such techniques is the only way to pierce the veil of judicial corruption.’ There are witnesses to Judge Murtagh's assertion of approval.During the appellate process permission of the judge was sought to disclose that he had previously authorized the undercover activity. He refused to give tha tpermission stating that he wanted no more criticism from the Appellate Division and that he would deny his authorization if I made it public. If I disclosed the prior authority het would deny he gave it to me.

 0,Etta James a hefty 63-year-old who has been singing professionally since she was a teenager was helped onto the stage at the B. B. King Blues Club by an attendant on Thursday night and she performed seated. She had the haughty jaded expression of an empress overseeing workaday matters as if she took her attentive band and the adoring audience for granted. And though her most recent album ''Blue Gardenia'' (Private Music/BMG) is a set of jazz standards she didn't sing any of them. Instead her set stuck to songs she may have performed thousands of times mostly her hits from the 1950's and 1960's.Yet on Thursday night the beginning of a three-night stand on the first anniversary of the club (at 243 West 42nd Street in Manhattan) Ms. James's routine reached into some essence of American music: the soul alchemy of sorrow laughter carnality fury loss and hope.Ms. James's voice remembers every stage of her life. She encompasses coy teenager and amorous woman heartbroken lover and spiteful victim party girl and desperate addict. Her 1995 autobiography ''Rage to Survive'' detailed her struggles with men drugs and the music business but her singing tells more.She wields her voice with the timing of a falcon breezing aloft and then darting directly and implacably toward its target. She flirts sobs chuckles taunts growls; she moans with satisfaction and with pain. In one song she sings quick glancing lines skimming them across a steady vamp; in the next she lingers over words connecting them in long caressing phrases. As she does even her familiar songs illuminate the emotional turmoil that they sum up so concisely.

 9,The situation seems to call for a tough quarterback and Crocicchia has credentials. He said his nose and his right little finger had been broken while boxing. Amateur boxing? ''No'' he said. College boxing? ''No'' he said ''bar boxing. I took a couple of hits but I can take care of myself. But don't make me out to be a fighter. My mother will kill me.''Before the strike Crocicchia put off job hunting and attempted to keep in shape by running playing tennis and trying to find pass receivers. He got some of his high school teammates to join him after they finished work and threw passes to them.''It's all coming back'' he said. ''I feel a little ahead of the game. Some guys' heads are spinning a bit. I have a grasp. But I need fine-tuning.''Busch was back at South Dakota State taking the 14 credits he needed for his degree helping coach the varsity quarterbacks and wide receivers as a $500-a-season graduate assistant. He was also bagging groceries at the Hy-Vee supermarket in Brookings S.D. for $4 an hour.Now he must take incompletes in his seven courses and when the strike is over he will look for a new job to earn expenses. He said it was all worth it and he cited a comment by Coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears.''He said that all of us are going to be on N.F.L. rosters'' said Busch. ''He said that's one thing they can't take away from you.'' ROSTER AT 52The Giants' roster remained at 52. Because the Giants play Monday night they have until 4 P.M.

 9,''People are of the perception that minorities raise third-generation hoodlums that people have no dreams and no goals'' said Gina Smith a Schomburg tenant who works as an office systems analyst.Instead say the people who live here they are struggling to bring up responsible children and proud to live in a community they see as stable. On a salary of $34000 Earlean B. is raising two children of her own and two nieces she adopted after their parents abandoned them. She pays $850 a month for her four-bedroom apartment and sends her children to private schools. It is so hard she said that she worries when one of her sons starts to cough because she knows she cannot spare the $50 to get him to a doctor.''You're working you're trying to make a living'' said the school worker who is trying to get her youngest daughter into a private school. ''Anyplace else you go it's the same - you can't run away from it. When I go out I take my kids with me but you can't always keep them. When they go downstairs you never know what will happen.''The people who live here complain about brazen drug dealers poor recreational facilities for their teen-agers inadequate police protection. But many others in the neighborhood say they would not move anywhere else. They say they enjoy their proximity to Central Park good public transportation and a strong sense of community.''I don't think anyone here has lived in fear'' said Sylvia Sadler a 45-year-old mother of two children who has lived in Schomburg Plaza for 13 years. ''We are a close-knit community. If we need something we can go to our neighbors. We want the same things for our kids as you do. I want a good education I want them to work and strive and be the best they can be.''This is not a community people here say that should be branded with the images of poverty fear and despair. There are several low-income projects in the neighborhood and graffiti mar some of the buildings. But there are also several moderate-to-middle-income apartments like Schomburg where with a federally subsidized mortgage tenant rents range from $375 for a studio apartment to $664 for a four-bedroom apartment.There are tree-lined streets where tulips bloom and garbage cans sit in tidy rows near brownstones under renovation. According to police and census data the neighborhood is not plagued either by sky-high crime rates or wrenching poverty.
 9,Liberia's two largest political factions moved today to set aside their differences and put an end to a bitter rivalry that has cost tens of thousands of lives.An accord between the National Patriotic Front and rival Interim Government of Liberia a breakthrough after months of stalemate was reached after a 90-minute meeting here between Charles Taylor the leader of the front and Amos Sawyer the interim President. Five West African heads of government also attended the meeting.Although details of the agreement were not disclosed both Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sawyer described the meeting at the country estate of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny as historic.But officials close to the talks cautioned that several major obstacles remain in the negotiations. There was virtually no discussion today of a date for free elections. The two sides also disagree on whether their troops should be integrated into a single army before or after elections are held.

 0,Season 2 Episode 4: ‘Blood in the Streets’This week’s episode “Blood in the Streets” is all about debt. Owing it. Owning it. Pardoning it and calling it in. It was Baron Rothschild the 18th-century nobleman who pronounced “The time to buy is when there’s blood in the streets” after he’d made a fortune buying up property when Napoleon lost at Waterloo. Naomi Klein in her 2007 book “The Shock Doctrine” argued that capitalism in the post-9/11 and Hurricane Katrina era of privatization monetizes disaster and disproportionately benefits the uber rich. Klein wrote:“It’s easy to imagine a future in which growing numbers of cities have their frail and long-neglected infrastructures knocked out by disasters and then are left to rot [...]. The well-off meanwhile will withdraw into gated communities their needs met by privatized providers.”“Left to rot” indeed.While watching the cold opening of this week’s episode wherein Nick sneaks around a tent encampment it was impossible not to note the Hurricane Katrina imagery. It wasn’t so long ago that Americans watched other Americans spell out “Save Us” on their rooftops. Nick then finds his way into a luxurious if empty housing development where a man Carlos is waiting for Strand.It was in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina that Strand before the apocalypse and before his good wardrobe lost his hard won fortune. The son of a strip mall preacher and long-absent mother Strand came into his own by buying up credit card debt until he had enough to make money in the way people who already have money do: by buying land. It just so happens that he sunk all his money into New Orleans before the city itself was sunk beneath floodwaters.Enter Thomas Abigail.Played by Dougray Scott whom some of you will recognize from the Cinderella fairy tale “Ever After” and others from the Tom Cruise fantasy “Mission Impossible II” Abigail has what Strand wants: money power and more than anything control. When Abigail catches Strand with his stolen credit cards (lifted during a flirtatious and drunken evening) the businessman proposes something other than jail time to a grateful Strand. But lest you think he’s in the clear Abigail reminds Strand: “I didn’t pardon you I obligated you.”
 9,''ANCIENT LIVES'' a four- part series examines ancient Egypt a land where the living shared territorial rights with the dead. Apparently this worked to everyone's advantage. A sense of community led to great art and interesting artifacts. The series begins on Channel 13 at 8 tonight.The opening program ''A Village of Craftsmen'' looks at a settlement in the hills of Thebes. (This is not to be confused with the Thebes in Greece; for one thing the Thebes in Egypt was older.) John Romer the host of the series says we know more about the people who lived in the settlement 3000 years ago than we do ''about most people in the last century.'' The ancient Egyptians were inveterate scribblers recording their lives on stone.Thus Mr. Romer an Egyptologist takes us on a tour of the village: Here lived a little old lady who adored a pet monkey; there lived a scribe who wrote love poetry. Mr. Romer scambles up hillsides and over fallen statuary. Sometimes he grows breathless and sometimes his British accent gets in the way. On the whole however he is not a bad guide.Nonetheless the great appeal here is not the lesson in Egyptology but the lesson in design. Have the graphic arts improved all that much in 3000 years? ''Ancient Lives'' indicates they have not. The people in the settlement decorated their own modest tombs with striking pictures carefully rendered. Even everyday artifacts were made with care. Form function and esthetic appeal seem to have been given equal weight.

 9,Instead companies with exposure to Asia and Russia -- like financial institutions -- or those that are heavily dependent on exports for earnings are perceived to be at the most risk in the near future and a risky partner for a potential merger.In addition merger activity among high-technology companies could fall off sharply as a direct result of the market decline. Internet stock prices in particular were in a free fall yesterday making it difficult for bankers and executives alike to figure out what price an acquired company should command.''There has been a chilling effect'' said Gene Sykes co-head of the high-technology group at Goldman Sachs & Company. ''Some deals won't get done for two weeks maybe a month. No one really knows.''But while Wall Street watchers are cautious about the future there is little concern that deals already struck this year will unravel. A market downturn itself is not enough to halt a transaction especially in stock-for-stock deals where the prices of both company's stock have fallen in tandem.The real deal-killers will be companies that either miss earnings or run into trouble abroad.Still the market has been rife the last two weeks with rumors about what deal will be the next to be scrapped or renegotiated like the recent renegotiation of the merger between Tellabs and Ciena. Early last week for instance rumors cropped up that the Travelers Group and Citicorp merger was being renegotiated something company executives said was untrue.

 0,Rick Sanchez a daytime anchor at CNN was fired on Friday a day after telling a radio interviewer that Jon Stewart was a bigot and that “everybody that runs CNN is a lot like Stewart.”CNNThe latter comment was made shortly after Mr. Stewart’s faith Judaism was invoked.CNN said in a statement Friday evening “Rick Sanchez is no longer with the company. We thank Rick for his years of service and we wish him well.”Mr. Sanchez’s comments came Thursday during a contentious conversation with the comedian Pete Dominick on satellite radio. By Friday afternoon a recording of the conversation had circulated widely on the Internet. He had appeared on the radio show as part of a tour to promote his book “Conventional Idiocy.”In the conversation Mr. Sanchez who is Cuban American repeatedly suggested that he had experienced subtle forms of racism in his television career.He said that “a lot of elite Northeast establishment liberals” view him as someone “who belongs in the second tier and not the top tier.”Among those establishment figures he said was Mr. Stewart the host of “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central and a friend of Mr. Dominick’s.At first Mr. Sanchez called Mr. Stewart a “bigot” but later took the word back calling the comedian “prejudicial” instead.Prejudicial “against who?” Mr. Dominick asked.Mr. Sanchez said “Against anybody who doesn’t agree to his point of view which is very much a white liberal establishment point of view.”One of the co-hosts of the radio show brought up the fact that Mr. Stewart is a Jew saying to Mr. Sanchez he is a minority “as much as you are.”Mr. Sanchez answered sarcastically “Yeah. Yeah. Very powerless people.” He let out a high-pitched laugh.“Everybody that runs CNN is a lot like Stewart” Mr. Sanchez said. “And a lot of people who run all the other networks are a lot like Stewart. And to imply that somehow they — the people in this country who are Jewish — are an oppressed minority? Yeah.”Mr. Stewart has made jokes about Mr. Sanchez more than 20 times in the last five years according to a search of the show’s Web site. Or as Mr. Sanchez put it “You watch yourself on his show every day and all they ever do is call you stupid.”Mr. Stewart was far from the only person known to mock Mr. Sanchez who was once tasered on camera for a segment. He was a polarizing figure within CNN but under the channel’s former president Jonathan Klein he was rewarded with more air time most recently a two-hour block in the afternoons. Mr. Klein was fired last week.On Thursday’s radio show in describing to Mr. Dominick the subtle racism he had experienced Mr. Sanchez described a conversation with a CNN executive who said “I really don’t see you as an anchor I see you more as a reporter I see you more as a John Quinones.” Mr. Quinones a correspondent and host for ABC is Hispanic.Said Mr. Sanchez of the unnamed executive “Now did he not realize that he was telling me ‘When I see you I think of Hispanic reporters.’ Because in his mind I can’t be an anchor. An anchor is what you give the high-profile white guys you know.”On Wednesday Mr. Sanchez ended a two-month stint as a prime-time anchor bridging the gap between Campbell Brown who left CNN in the spring and Eliot Spitzer and Kathleen Parker who take over the 8 p.m. time slot on Monday.Mr. Sanchez who posts on Twitter more often than just about any other cable news anchor posted nothing on Friday. Attempts to reach him offline were unsuccessful.

 9,Here is a random sampling from manufacturers' documentations that supposedly clarify things for newcomers to home computers.- ''You can use (WSBAUD.BAS) to set the baud rate for your (computer). However the setting will only be in effect as long as the computer is not rebooted from a cold start.''- ''Remember to initialize the sum before the next FOR-NEXT loop.'' - Examples of Daisy Wheel Pitch Changes: 'The word ''Acrammed'' is printed in alternate pitch will print with the word ''crammed'' in 12 pitch and the rest in 10 pitch if no preceeding. CW commands have altered pitch.''- ''The Override procedure used to (1) override BSC parameters specified in the user program without recompiling the program or (2) specified parameters that cannot be specified by the user program.''- ''The main menu showing single-control-character (non-prefix) editing commands displays at the default help level level 3.'' Should you decide that you can muddle through this mystery that you are going to keep your equipment you'll be urged to send in your ownership registration card to the manufacturer. Your may be surprised to find though that you are not a consumer (as in consumer's name address etc). You are an ''end user'' whatever that means.Having dutifully mailed in your card you are then warned to ''write protect'' in bold letters somewhere. It means that your program disks are not protected against accidental erasures; to keep your program from self-destructing you have to put a piece of tape over one of the notches. You know write protect.You are also told in the beginning of the documentation that you should sit in the ''cockpit'' at your terminal facing your keyboard and monitor. Do you think that means pull up a chair and get yourself familiar with your computer?The trouble is that the words and expressions begin to make sense after a while. You find yourself ''interfacing'' (talking) with other owners blurting out sentences like: ''We really felt the need to buy a double-sided double disk drive. After all we have a growing family.'' Or ''The dot matrix printer is okay if you're just using it around the house but I'd never think of having my output seen in public without an LQP.''Should you feel the urge to be part of a brotherhood of computer owners (user group) you may decide to start by picking up some magazines at your computer store (product center). A quick scan will convince you that English is not spoken here. The following are honest-to-goodness excerpts from letters to the editor in a recent edition of one of them:- ''(The author of an article's) comment 'The fact that the PC uses the Intel 8088 microprocessor...makes it a strictly ASCII machine' is nonsense. The 8088 processor does not preclude the use of EBCDIC or any other character code.''- ''The account you gave of the origins of the MS-DOS is incorrect. MS-DOS was originally written by Seattle Computer Products under the name 86-DOS. Microsoft modified 86-DOS for the PC and in late 1981 bought the rights to 86-DOS from SCP for distribution as MS-DOS.''
 0,That didn’t take long.A new song “50 Shots” by the New York rapper Papoose is making the rounds on the Web. It is a profanity-laced rant about the police shooting of Sean Bell whose funeral was tonight with attacks on everybody from Patrick J. Lynch the president of the patrolmen’s union to The New York Post. “Aesthetically the song is a mess” says Tom Breihan of the The Village Voice nevertheless calling it a “clear-minded and righteous example of political rage set to music.” (He has a link to the song; post your own reviews below but please keep it clean.)Update: Kelefa Sanneh the music critic for The Times who reviewed a Papoose concert on Feb. 26 writes for the Saturday paper:This is a rhyme that sometimes feels more like a vituperative blog entry. Listeners sometimes wonder why hip-hop doesn’t produce more fiery protest music. “50 Shots” an unsubtle little song that packs a thrilling little charge is proof that the protest tradition lives on. It may also help listeners understand why this sort of thing isn’t more common. Your average hip-hop track is more freewheeling than this one and much more fun. If most rappers prefer boasts to brickbats — well you can see (and hear) why.Note: The original 12:50 p.m. post “That Didn’t Take Long” was updated at 10:52 p.m. Friday.RelatedThis Time Some Black Leaders See a Mayor They Can Stand ByBloomberg and the Black Community [The Empire Zone]A Former Detective’s Plea [The Empire Zone]For Owners of Strip Club in Shooting a Decade of Raids and SuitsWhat a Fourth Man Saw if He Exists Could Provide Answers in ShootingOpining: Debate Amid the Bullets [Urban Studies The City]In Brooklyn a Fatal Shooting a Police Chase and an ArrestFamilies Torn by Police Shots Reunited in GriefBridegroom’s Legacy Remembered at His FuneralComment Zone: The Bell Investigation [The Empire Zone]

Putin would revive stalled economic reforms.The Russian Trading System stock index the main stock market barometer in the country rose 18 percent to 177.71. The increase was the greatest one-day jump since July 14 1998 when the International Monetary Fund agreed to lend Russia $22.8 billion.But a month later the Russian economy collapsed. Since then the market had languished with periodic rallies occurring on very low volumes.Russian stocks traded in the United States rallied today as well.

 0,Lately I’ve apologized to Marguerite H. for suggesting that she was insensitive to genocide in Darfur and today let me express profound contrition to a wronged breed of dog. In my Tuesday column I made a passing reference to “the White House and its Dobermans” referring to Paul Wolfowitz Don Rumsfeld and assorted hacks in the news media.Deborah wrote from San Diego to take offense: “As the proud owners of 3 Doberman Pinschers for the last 25 years we take umbrage at your attempt to compare this honest trustworthy loyal courageous loving and devoted breed with the current occupants of the White House. No Doberman Pinscher would ever cravenly run away from a fight ala Bush Cheney and Wolfowitz and then 30 years later set loose the dogs of war while cynically accusing those objecting of cowardice and treason. You owe Dobermans everywhere an apology.”So here it is. I’m sorry Dobermans!

 9,It was muddy and chilly and their request for bleachers television platforms and tents had been ignored by park officials. But for the men and women who pride themselves on camaraderie derring-do and a high tolerance for ale nothing could spoil yesterday's rugby tournament in Central Park.Hundreds of the world's best rugby players sprinted up and down the pitch -- the field in American football parlance -- as they fought for the title in the New York Sevens Tournament one of the largest in the country. No ordinary rugby match it is a faster version of the conventional game less about strength than speed. As the name suggests each half lasts seven minutes and each side has seven players.But the rest the unabashed ruggedness of the game remains the same. Taking up five fields in the North Meadow men and women scrambled in their now-so-fashionable striped shirts wearing next to nothing in the way of protection and accouterments. No pads. No clunky helmets. No adhesive nose strips to make breathing easier.So it was not surprising that little vexed the players about the snub -- not the fact there was no grass on the field or no place to change but the windy sidelines and no doubt that had this been football or soccer things would have worked out differently. Rugby's popularity is growing in the United States especially on college campuses but it has not caught on with everyone.

 0,Robert Walker/The New York TimesFRIDAY’S PUZZLE — Take a deep breath everyone – it’s Friday.Much like Jean ARP at 51 Across Tim Croce has done some artful configuring in today’s puzzle which has a slew of never-before-seen words that make solving it a breath of fresh air.Lieutenant of the musketeers D’ARTAGNAN makes his grand debut today which seems surprising because his comrades-in-arms Athos Porthos and Aramis are used as crossword answers fairly often. (A check-in at the XWord Info’s Hall of Records shows they’ve been used a combined total of 50 times since 1993.) Being a member of the three musketeers has its benefits but three cheers for Tim for bringing D’Artagnan some glory.Another newbie comes at 61 Across with a phrase clued as “like real danger.” Those who survived the LSAT might remember the answer from a Supreme Court opinion but this particular turn of phrase had a franchise life after it retired from law and it titled a best-selling Tom Clancy novel and a Hollywood film.There’s an environmental undercurrent today as you might expect after filling in GAIA. While you’re birdwatching at 18 Across and 62 Down don’t neglect the wildlife underfoot — there’s a baby salamander or EFT hiding down below. It’s an unusual ecosystem though with SIROCCOS blowing over the SHORE. (Bert the Turtle of “Duck and Cover” fame might feel out of his element there but he’d feel at home filling the screen at 16 Across.)While you solve a puzzle that includes both Kansas and dust-laden winds I hope you enjoy this song:How did you like it?

 9,A Congressional attempt to rescue the Small Business Administration from termination as proposed by the White House is being threatened by a resonant clash of Senate personalities focused at least ostensibly on the issue of officially sanctioned prayer in the public schools.Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee had drafted a compromise bill that would reduce the cost of the small-business agency $2.5 billion over three years.The Connecticut Republican who says the measure would continue the most important functions of the agency had won support for it from Senate leaders and was prepared last week to bring it to the floor.But then Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina introduced a proposal to legalize school prayer as an amendment to the Weicker bill which had the effect of postponing floor action indefinitely. Under these circumstances Senator Bob Dole the majority leader cannot bring up the business-agency legislation without risking tying up the Senate for weeks on school prayer any time Senator Helms chooses to call up his amendment.

 9,Not since Erik Bruhn in the 1960's has the role of Albrecht been refined to such a noble essence. Anyone who saw had seen the Bolshoi-trained Mr. Malakhov in 1988 when he appeared with the Moscow Classical Ballet in Boston might have wondered how he would apply his flamboyant virtuosity to "Giselle." His debut with Ballet Theater in "Les Sylphides" last week showed his lyrical side and any fears that his youthful mannerisms might not be under control were dispelled by his stunning and artistically mature performance in "Giselle."Matched superbly with Ms. McKerrow who danced flawlessly and omitted no step he stayed within the production's guidelines and yet imposed his own style upon his role. Mr. Malakhov's long line and classical placement give off a princely image; his commanding presence was sensed from the start and he ordered Hilarion his rival out with a glance.As a dancer his perfect lines are not always matched with clean finishes in his air turns. But his extraordinary soft landings and high leaps were combined with some heart-stopping moments: the way he spiraled to the ground when Albrecht was exhausted and kept his hand to his heart while he flew across the stage in a series of leg beats.Ms. McKerrow has still to deepen her mad scene in Act I but her dancing has a vividness and classical style that provides a great deal of depth. Less exotic than Mr. Malakhov who seemed in his own world she nonetheless met him on his elevated ground.It was a fine cast. Steven Hyde's Hilarion effectively sketched out a portrait of a good man turned cynic. Keith Roberts and Sandra Brown typed often as contemporary dancers actually offered the best peasant pas de deux of the weekend. Mr. Roberts was always precise and Ms. Brown was full of verve. Christine Dunham's Myrta had a beauty of elongated line.

 0,The dainty slippers pictured on the cover of “Women’s Work” may have been a marketing ploy on the part of the publisher but the image is so precious so trite and so likely to backfire that it deserves extra points for sheer perversity. Anyone who picks up Megan K. Stack’s new book anticipating a gentle meditation on domestic life will be swiftly disabused within the first 20 pages when Stack describes in (legitimately) excruciating detail her experience of going into labor with her first child. “I distinctly felt my hip bones dragging themselves apart” she writes. “My skeleton was being dismantled.”Stack formerly a war correspondent for The Los Angeles Times left her plum journalism job in 2011 full of expectation for the child she was about to have and the second book she planned to write. “I imagined long silent afternoons in spotless rooms typing clean lines of prose while the baby napped beatifically in a sunbeam” she recalls.Needless to say life as a new parent wasn’t so obliging — even if she and her husband Tom a journalist himself could easily afford to outsource most of the domestic work in Beijing where they lived. They hired a woman to watch their son and clean the house and cook the meals; a few years later when Stack was pregnant with their second child and the family moved to Delhi for Tom’s job they employed two women at once to do the same things.Memoirs about motherhood are exceedingly common but “Women’s Work” dares to explore the labor arrangements that often make such books possible. It brought to mind “My Hollywood” Mona Simpson’s excellent novel about the knotty bond between a composer and the Filipina caregiver she hires. As Stack herself admits — in an author’s note that’s as ruthlessly and relentlessly self-aware as the rest of her book — she had little in common with the women she employed. “They were poor women brown women migrant women” she writes. “And at first I pushed them to the edge of thought. They were important to me primarily because they made me free.”

 9,If there's a typical letter from readers of this column it's something like this one I recently received from a New York City resident:''Help! I need it desperately. I am in the market for a new point-and-shoot camera to replace a Canon Sure-Shot which was stolen last summer. I reverted to using my old beloved Minolta Autocord but find it somewhat cumbersome heavy and expensive when it comes to processing.''I have done research and am most confused. I want a zoom camera that is reliable not too difficult to handle and which incorporates all the lastest features - although I am confident that a week after I make my purchase several new models will be in the stores. As of now I have narrowed the field to six cameras with a side-glance at a seventh. They are not in order of preference:''Minolta Freedom Zoom 90 Nikon Zoom 500 Olympus Infinity 200 300 and 330 Pentax IQ Zoom and a side-glance to the Olympus AZ-4 Zoom.'' The letter goes on to note the urgency of my response since a trip to an exotic foreign locale is impending.First of all my ability to respond to letters asking for camera advice is limited by the number of requests for same that regularly arrive in my pathetically miniscule mailbox. Second I have to congratulate this particular reader for the intelligence with which she went about finding cameras that seem to fit her needs. And third I need to clear up some misconceptions about camera shopping.Personally I hate shopping of any sort. The process seems designed to lead one from total ignorance to total confusion. Most salespeople just make it worse. So like many consumers I read up on the subject of my purchase first. If the subject is cameras I would buy magazines like Popular Photography Photo District News or Consumers Reports to see what's out there. I'd also poll my friends who have cameras to see what they're using these days.

 9,For much of its 67-year history The New Yorker has seemed to float in splendid isolation a law unto itself unruffled by the turbulence that disturbs lesser magazines.The last decade has changed all that.The announcement that Tina Brown the editor in chief of Vanity Fair will replace Robert A. Gottlieb as editor of The New Yorker means the magazine will have its second new editor in five years. The changes in editorship represent a dramatic increase in the metabolic rate of a magazine whose first two editors Harold W. Ross and William Shawn presided for more than half a century.Mr. Shawn a managing editor who took over the top spot when Mr. Ross died in 1951 after in effect having run the show for two years edited the magazine for so long that an entire generation of readers grew up with no memory of the Ross New Yorker a quite different magazine than the one Mr. Gottlieb inherited from Mr. Shawn. From Bite to WhimsyIn its original form The New Yorker was a brilliant unpredictable product of the Jazz Age irreverent brisk gossipy and sharp. The provocative tone was set by contributors like Dorothy Parker Wolcott Gibbs Robert Benchley and James Thurber and later by S. J. Perelman and A. J. Liebling.

 9,In the first quarter Joe Dawkins's 32‐yard kick off return gave the Giants the ball at their 44‐yard line. All they got out of that possession was George Hunt's 35‐yard field goal.In the second quarter a decent drive took them to the Dallas 36 but Harvey Martin sacked Morton on third down and Hunt had topunt. Later in the quarter Jim Stienke playing free safety in place of the injured Spider Lockhart intercepted two Staubach passes. The Giants couldn't get a first down either time.The third quarter provided even better opportunities. A running‐into‐the‐punter penalty kept a Giant drive alive and its was further enhanced when the officials placed the ball at the Dallas 9 for a first down after it appeared that Morton had failed to make the necessary one foot.However on third down from the 7 Morton threw a pass in Walker Gillette's direction only to have it snared out of its route by Ed (Too Tall) Jones the 6foot‐9‐inch left end.“We had a safety blitz and I had to cover the backs man‐to‐man” Jones said after his first N.F.L. interception. “We drifted back and Craig threw it and it just happened to be in my reach and I caught it. It scared the daylights out of me.”“I tried to get away from the safety blitz to get the ball off” the quarterback added “and the only receiver open was Gillette. Everybody else was blocking. He [Jones] just fell off and he was there.”Later in the quarter a pass interference call against Leroy Jordan the outstanding linebacker gave the Giants the ball at the 50 but on the next play a clipping penalty against Gillette sent the ball back to the 35 and moments later Morton was dumped by Jethro Pugh on third down.

 9,Japan adopted a cautious approach today to suggestions that it undertake a major aid program for the Middle East as officials showed some embarrassment that fighting had ended with Parliament still debating an earlier pledge to aid the war effort.In the last week or so senior associates of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu have begun suggesting that Japan should lead the way to help create a new "Marshall Plan" for the Middle East in part to mitigate its reputation for aloofness which was reinforced because of its slowness in aiding the war effort.But officials today rejected the idea that Japan would push for any such broad effort suggesting that "we're not talking about big figures" as one put it. Instead he said Japan would engage in low-key consultations with various countries and tailor aid programs for each of them. He said such proposals as one that Japan put up an extra $1 billion a year for the Middle East had no standing in the Government now. 'People Will Start Screaming'Officials pledged emergency aid for Kuwait to get back on its feet but rejected the idea of long-term assistance saying that "people will start screaming if we start grants to the richest country in the world."

The Warriors’ Jim Barnett scored at the buzzer.It was only the Bucks’ fourth loss of the season two of them to the Warriors. Milwaukee's home‐court winning streak was snapped at 24 games.Kareem Jabbar who com mitted four fouls in the first half led the Bucks with 30 points but missed two free throws with 1:42 left and the score tied. Milwaukee played without Oscar Robertson who had the flu while the Warrior center Nate Thurmond missed another game with an injured hand.

 9,With a budget squeezed by declining revenues and greater demands and with a new City Charter even mayoral power is subject to increasing limits. But that power can still be substantial if only because no other city official has as much. Can anyone doubt that if Mayor Dinkins is concerned about early childhood education he will find a way to translate that concern into policy?But power is also at the root of the fears. Will the new Mayor be fair and evenhanded? Or will he be insensitive toward groups that didn't support him and made no secret of their dislike for blacks? Or will he be so concerned with meeting unrealistically high expectations of the poor and their advocates that he'll bankrupt the city?Mr. Dinkins would seem to have answered the first two concerns already. His entire political background his campaign theme of healing and his first appointments all bespeak fairness. If anything he has demonstrated that he'll risk angering his black base to be evenhanded. The second concern ignores both his acknowledgment of the city's fiscal limitations the role of the City Council which must approve his spending plans and other institutional constraints.But power is only part of the significance of David Dinkins's mayoralty and in the long run maybe not the most important part. Only after the late Schools Chancellor Richard Green died did most non-black New Yorkers appreciate how important he had been as a symbol to the African-American youth of New York. Mayor Dinkins is an even more potent symbol.Months ago before he formally announced his candidacy Mr. Dinkins sat with a group of reporters and editors from The Times and reflected on how pleasant and secure and comfortable he was as Manhattan Borough President. Nevertheless it was already clear that at age 61 he had decided to sacrifice comfort and security for the challenge of winning the second-hardest job in America. He chose not to be paralyzed by fear of losing but propelled by hope of winning.

 0,Howard Eisley stepped back and faded a bit off balance but still confident that his 21-foot jumper would hit the spot. And why not?Eisley a 6-foot-2 guard for the Knicks had hardly missed all night making five 3-pointers and nearly matching his career high in scoring in just three quarters. So when his shot fell through the net with 48 seconds left against the Memphis Grizzlies tonight at The Pyramid saving the Knicks from their second straight painful collapse Eisley simply turned and ran downcourt his face typically stoic.But his teammates were excited about Eisley's timely shooting. Allan Houston shook his head in amazement and stared at him. Latrell Sprewell gave him a bearhug.After all it is not every day that a Knicks point guard scores 30 points. Eisley made 6 of 9 3-pointers 12 of 15 shots over all and scored 7 points in the final 2 minutes 2 seconds. He is the first Knicks point guard to score 30 since Mark Jackson on April 18 1992. Eisley's scoring binge was not in vain. It sparked the Knicks to a 108-102 victory.

 0,The new attention to turnout also reflects the emerging influence of the Internet which through e-mail directed at registered Democrats and Republicans could supplant the door knock and the evening telephone call as the easiest and most effective way of reaching sure-fire supporters.This changing environment is one force that has made the presidential campaign of Howard Dean who has assembled an extraordinarily motivated base of supporters so unpredictable and it is why some Democrats are not as quick as Republicans to discount Dr. Dean's chances of defeating Mr. Bush should he become his party's nominee.Voter turnout campaigns are typically more influential in primaries because fewer people vote making the outcome easier to affect. At the very least several Democrats said Dr. Dean's ability to use new techniques to identify and turn out a base of supporters makes him a formidable figure in early primary states.But Dr. Dean in remarks at a pig roast here in central New Hampshire this afternoon noted that a shift of just a few percentage points in states like New Hampshire would have delivered the White House to Al Gore in 2000. And he urged supporters who showed up at his events to register their e-mail addresses with his campaign so they can be contacted as Election Day approaches. Dr. Dean's aides are creating a database that merges e-mail addresses with voter registration rolls and the history of voting behavior.This is the latest chapter of a shift that became particularly vivid after the 2000 presidential election which White House officials believe Mr. Bush nearly lost because the Democrats mounted the kind of highly effective voter turnout effort that had long been identified with the party. Thus in the 2002 midterm elections Republicans put in place a plan known as the 72-Hour Task Force to identify Republican voters and get them to the polls. The Republicans beat the Democrats at their own game winning control of the Senate while widening their margin in the House.David B. Magleby the dean of social sciences at Brigham Young University who conducted a study of spending in the 2002 Congressional election reported evidence of a sharp change in emphasis away from television advertisements and toward get-out-the-vote efforts. He is planning a study of the 2004 race and said he expected each party to significantly increase the resources devoted to getting out the vote.Republicans are almost certain to enjoy an advantage in their operations because of a huge fund-raising advantage. Officials from each party declined to say how much they were planning to spend on setting up turnout operations but the parties have already begun registering voters setting up computer programs and training party officials in ways to identify and turn out supporters.

 0,Advice Parental Quandary Every Friday we pose a question to the Motherlode community. The next week we pull together the best responses. Got a quandary? E-mail KJ ». Read more »This week’s quandary came from a message J. sent via Facebook: How she asked can we keep the children in our great family-friendly neighborhood from hanging out with us in our yard — all the time?J.’s block sounds pretty idyllic. “Kids run around unsupervised go from one yard to another without thinking about boundaries neighbors know each others’ kids …” Which means that whenever there’s a backyard activity suddenly there’s a whole party of children ready and willing to jump in. That’s great if you’re a kid at loose ends for the afternoon and not so great if you’re trying to have an outdoor party with just visiting family or just don’t feel like having the whole neighborhood in your backyard.My husband who works from home and so is available after school at times a lot of working parents aren’t (including me) wants to toss a football or visit the river to explore with our boys in the afternoon. He expresses frustration that he wants to share those experiences with his own sons not a larger group of neighborhood kids.J. knows this is a good problem to have but still it’s a problem if only one of tact and etiquette. She doesn’t want to be unfriendly and often the neighborhood kids are perfectly welcome at her house just as her children often are at other houses on the block.“We just wonder” she writes “how to communicate ‘this is family time’ or ‘this is a backyard gathering spontaneous and casual but you’re still not invited’ without alienating others” particularly when those others are just kids.

 9,What is still baffling the investigators trying to determine whether terrorists were behind the World Trade Center bombing is the effective silence that has followed it.Since attention is a main goal of terrorism the people responsible for such acts usually find a way to make it clear that they were the ones who carried them out. But in the aftermath of the bombing on Friday at the World Trade Center none of the more than 50 callers who have claimed responsibility have presented convincing proof."What has appeared to be lacking is a definitive claim of responsibility in which a group demonstrates that they were the ones who committed the act" said a senior Federal official involved in the investigation. Earmarks of TerrorismYet at the same time Federal officials and private experts said the explosion bore many of the earmarks of a terrorist attack including the size of the explosion and the choice of a symbolic target.
 9,PARIS May 31 — The Foreign Minister of France returned from Spain tonight confident that he had strengthened economic military and cultural cooperation between the governments of President de Gaulle and Generalissimo Francisco Franco.Maurice Couve de Murville the French minister had been in Madrid since Thursday as the guest of Fernando Maria Castiella y Maiz Foreign Minister of Spain.Qualified sources declared that no major agreements had been concluded during the visit. Its importance they said lay in the manner in which the two foreign ministers endorsed further cooperation between their countries.The French Government is well aware that the hostility of Britain Norway and Denmark probably bars Spain's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
 0,Less than two minutes before the Texas A&M kicker Layne Neumann connected on a go-ahead 32-yard field goal.Texas Tech (4-1) has now won five of its last six games against Texas A&M (4-1)."The character that it takes to engineer a comeback like this is big" Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach said. "It's very gratifying."Harrell completed 32 of 45 passes for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns three of which were to Johnson. During the game-winning drive he was 5 of 7 for 75 yards and Texas Tech had a fourth-down conversion inside its 40-yard line.On his last touchdown Harrell said he recognized the blitz and called an audible for Johnson to run a streak pattern instead of a slant."Graham was calm out there the whole time" Johnson said. "He reminds me of Tom Brady."The Aggies' last-minute meltdown Saturday is likely to turn up the heat on Franchione who is paid an annual salary of $2 million. He is a woeful 1-3 versus the Red Raiders an unacceptable mark for a football-rich school that considers Texas its biggest rival and that expects to be a national power."This game is not the end to all wherewithal whether we had won the game or lost the game" Franchione said. "There's more critical important games to play."On a sun-baked day in which temperatures hovered near 90 degrees the Aggie defense reverted back to old habits Saturday under first-year defensive coordinator Gary Darnell.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Red Raiders feasted rolling up 297 of their 433 offensive yards in the first half for a 24-14 halftime lead.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyYet until Saturday's last-minute collapse the Aggies played better defensively in the second half allowing them to rally behind a ground attack that compiled 250 yards.Of that sophomore Jorvorskie Lane pounded out 77 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries.Texas A&M tied the game at 24-24 on a 4-yard run by the junior fullback Chris Alexander with 8:44 left. The Aggies then grabbed the lead on Neumann's second field goal but then came Texas Tech's late heroics."We had a maximum blitz and someone failed to make it maximum" said Darnell of the game-winning play.The epitome of college football's hot coach when he arrived at Texas A&M in December 2002 Franchione has thus far been unable to replicate his makeover magic in previous stops at Alabama Texas Christian and New Mexico.The Aggies are 20-20 during his four-year tenure and have advanced to the postseason only once. R.C. Slocum whom Franchione replaced was 21-15 in his last three years and led Texas A&M to bowl appearances in each of those seasons.Although Texas A&M entered Saturday undefeated its record was somewhat misleading.Its four victories have come against teams that entering Saturday were a combined 6-11 this season. One of those wins included stopping Army just short of the end zone on the game's final play to escape with a 28-24 win.Nearly an hour after Saturday's game the final score remained on some of Kyle Field's scoreboards as jubilant Texas Tech fans congregated near the Red Raider locker room.The Aggies must still play Oklahoma Nebraska and at Texas.Although Franchione wouldn't admit it Saturday's loss was clearly a setback for him and A&M."It's tough" he said.
 9,In a new world order that is melding Wall Street and Silicon Valley the business of buying and selling stocks for smaller investors is being shaped as much by lesser-known on-line brokerage firms as it is by the big brand-name firms.While Charles Schwab & Company and E*Trade have established themselves as the most recognizable on-line names the fastest-growing firms are Waterhouse Securities a discount broker turned on-line provider that does relatively little advertising and Datek Online a broker that caters to what some in the business call ''hyperactive traders.''And that analysts say is another hint that when it comes to the retail market -- that is smaller investors -- the shape of things to come may be trickling up from below.''All the big Wall Street firms are looking at how these companies are shaping on-line trading'' said Bernard L.

 0,To the Editor:Re ''A Global Warning to Mr. Bush'' (editorial Feb. 26):Before putting pressure on the White House to act shouldn't we be asking whether global warming is really happening?The Kilimanjaro ice cap is not a thermometer. It may well be melting but this is simply a delayed consequence of a natural climate warming during the early part of the 20th century. Moreover it will continue to melt as long as the climate doesn't return to the temperatures of the Little Ice Age of past centuries.The National Academy of Sciences published a report last year that defines the geographic regions of warming and cooling during the last 20 years. Surface measurements of East Africa show no warming trend. Weather satellites show a pronounced cooling trend of the atmosphere there.S.

 9,The upturn comes after nearly four years of layoffs and hiring freezes aimed at keeping state and local budgets in the black. Even after the recovery got rolling in 1983 these governments balked at hiring until they were sure of budget surpluses says Laura Ruben an economist for the Federal Reserve Board.But an end to the hiring may be already be in sight. Mrs. Ruben says that a recent survey showed that state and local budget surpluses are shrinking. For some 28 states surpluses will be less than 1 percent of expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 1986 -down from a comfortable 5 percent for 1985. The Almighty Yen? A stronger yen was a major goal of September's five-nation effort to force the dollar down against other currencies. During 1985's first two months the currency had weakened to 250 yen to the dollar which made Japanese imports even more attractive in the United States.Now says WataruYamamoto manager of foreign exchange at Fuju Bank Ltd. in New York because of the intervention effort - selling dollars in the open market - and because Japan tightened its money supply forcing up interest rates the yen has strengthened 17 percent against the dollar in the past six weeks. The currency is now close to the 200-to-the-dollar level - where it has not been since early 1981 - and may even break this ''psychological barrier'' said Mr. Yamamoto. But ''without continued intervention'' he said the yen ''would weaken to 230 to 240 by spring.'' Only lower interest rates in the United States or Japanese economic growth of better than 5 percent annually could keep the yen at about 200 otherwise Mr. Yamamoto contends.He considers the 200 mark to be an optimal one for both Japan and the United States: At stronger yen levels he says Japanese goods would become too expensive for Americans and his nation's exports would be hit too hard.

 0,A parliamentarian Martin Hohmann of the conservative Christian Democrats has refused to apologize for saying that Jews could be described as a ''race of perpetrators'' for their role in the Russian Revolution. In an Oct. 3 speech in Neuhof his hometown Mr. Hohmann compared the killings in Russia's violent 1917 revolution which he said were orchestrated by Jewish Bolsheviks with the murder of Europe's Jews during the Holocaust. Jewish leaders and members of all Germany's political parties have condemned the remarks and deputies from Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats have called for Mr. Hohmann's dismissal from Parliament.

 9,Thirty-seven Mozambicans were reported killed and 62 wounded today when rebels attacked a convoy of buses under military escort south of here. It was the third attack of its kind in two weeks in a war that will not go away.The conflict diplomats and other analysts said is paralyzing a nation torn by successive conflicts for more than two decades where sovereignty is so eroded so that the Government controls little more than cities and outlying outposts.It is a war one Western diplomat said that seems stalemated the rebels unable to penetrate the cities and Government forces unable to extend their writ into the countryside of this nation lying along the Indian Ocean in southern Africa.Mozambican officials said the latest attack took place close to Manhica 70 miles south of this crumbling whistle stop and only 30 miles north of the capital Maputo.

 0,"We consider that the advert is in danger of implying that the drink may bring sexual-social success because the man in question looks quite attractive and desirable to the girls" the regulators said. "If the man was clearly unattractive we think that this implication would be removed."Lambrini first ran afoul of the authority with ads featuring provocative wordplay. Since then the watchdog group has required Lambrini which is owned by Halewood International to run its proposed ads past its "copy advice" team before publication. That service is available to all advertisers on a voluntary basis but the authority decided that Lambrini's history of flouting the spirit of its rules justified mandatory vetting.Halewood complained that the regulators were overstepping their bounds. "The watchdog makes some very understandable rulings to encourage sensible drinking but we're not sure they're qualified to decide for the nation who's sexy and who's not" John Halewood the company's owner told British newspapers. "Beauty is after all in the eye of the beholder."The standards organization which is financed by the advertising industry said its comments to Halewood were intended as confidential advice since they were made during the preapproval process and should not have been released to the press."We're not saying you can't have attractive people in adverts" said Matthew Wilson a spokesman for the authority. "You just can't link alcohol to sexual success."
 9,Polish hams vacuum packed were on sale today on one street corner for 1023 rubles and a downtown store was selling five kinds of smoked fish at prices ranging from 25 rubles a pound to more than 50. There were no lines there nor were there any at the market where cucumbers were being sold at 70 rubles a pound and more. Champagne sold in the commercial stores was going for 120 rubles a bottle and more while a bottle of vodka cost 100 rubles."How can I buy anything at the market when I can't afford what is in the stores?" lamented Mrs. Vrublevskaya's neighbor Lena who with her husband supports their family of four on 700 rubles a month. "How can it be a proper New Year's?" she asked tears in her eyes. 'We Are Slowly Dying'Nobody knows for sure what the prices will be on Thursday but Mrs. Vrublevskaya who depends on word of mouth for her news said people in lines were saying that a loaf of white bread would cost 5 rubles and a loaf of black bread 4 rubles. The current price is about 40 kopecks.The economists hope that a jump in state prices will bring in new shipments of goods and food and restore some balance to a now deeply unstable pricing system. But Mrs. Vrublevskaya who is cheerfully fatalistic sees no reason to hope."We are slowly dying" she said with great calm "just as the Bible said we would. The only expectation is for things to get worse. Either there will be a civil war or we will all burn together as it is written in the Apocalypse."But more immediately Mrs. Vrublevskaya lives in constant dread of falling ill or becoming destitute and losing the children to an orphanage. Abandoned by their mother her daughter the two children are entirely dependent on their grandmother.When she was released from the hospital Mrs. Vrublevskaya was given instructions that in the current situation were almost laughable. The doctors advised her to eat four or five dried peaches a day but with dried peaches selling for 50 rubles a pound she sees no way of following their advice on this and on other matters.

 9,In the strongest show of support to date for the embattled Microsoft Corporation 26 computer industry executives have written to the Justice Department saying that any delay in the introduction of Windows 98 will harm the computer industry.''Our success depends on the freedom of Microsoft and the rest of America's personal computer industry to create new and innovative products'' their letter says.The support for Microsoft comes at a time when attorneys general from 13 states are close to preparing a joint antitrust action against Microsoft apparently aimed at blocking the release of Windows 98. The next version of Microsoft's operating software for personal computers Windows 98 will be shipped to computer makers starting this month and is to be released to the public by late June. The Justice Department meanwhile has been pressing its own suit against the company.The executives' letter which was sent to Joel Klein assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division contends that delaying the operating system would affect the more than two million programmers who write software for Windows-based computers as well as an equal number who work in the computer services industry. The executives said that a delay would also injure the makers of hardware and peripheral products.

 0,Updated 11:06 a.m. | Even as supporters of congestion pricing prepared to gather at City Hall at 11 a.m. today to cheer the City Council’s vote approving the plan and to urge the State Legislature to approve the $8-a-day traffic fees opponents of congestion pricing have mobilized as well — at least in their talking points.City Room received an intriguing e-mail message this morning from Carolyn Daly and Corey B. Bearak of Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free a group that opposes congestion pricing.“Despite all of the efforts of the city administration and City Council the congestion pricing scheme died at midnight last night” they wrote. “Last year the State Senate State Assembly and governor passed into law legislation which set out the creation of the commission to study traffic congestion. It also set the deadline for final action in a clear and unambiguous manner. That legal deadline was March 31 2008. The language is very clearly and explicit. And it is equally clear that the State Legislature did not approve anything regarding congestion pricing by the stated deadline. The governor did not sign any measure into law by the stated deadline.”Although a federal memorandum of understanding with the city sets the deadline at April 7 — rather than March 31 — that deadline is “legally only an agreement to agree and does not supersede a law” Mr. Bearak and Ms. Daly wrote.Unsurprisingly supporters of congestion pricing immediately dismissed the argument as specious. After all if the Legislature set the March 31 deadline in the first place the Legislature can extend such deadline.“This is nonsense” Stu Loeser the press secretary for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wrote in an e-mail message in response to questions from The Times. “As we are reminded again and again a current Legislature cannot bind the hands of a future one. The State Legislature has the same powers to pass congestion pricing today as they did yesterday.”Gene Russianoff a staff lawyer at the Straphangers Campaign of the New York Public Interest Research Group also scoffed at the notion. “April 7 is the real deadline — 90 days since the start of the legislative session which was the requirement” he said in a phone interview. “The March 31 deadline which is part of the law that created the commission on which I sat is not a real deadline. The Legislature could just change it. If the Legislature decides to do congestion pricing the March 31 deadline will not be an obstacle — or an excuse.”

 0,''There's a strong feeling this is a marriage not an affair'' the official said.Mr. Mehta was one of 40 candidates offered by the recruiting firm of Spencer Stuart & Associates but he quickly topped the list Mr. Guenther said. ''We were told the best is Zarin Mehta but you'll never get him'' he said. He called Mr. Mehta ''the best executive director in the country.''Mr. Mehta since 1990 president and chief executive officer of Ravinia the open-air music festival in Highland Park near Chicago the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's summer home since 1936 said that his appointment given his family's history was ''an extraordinary move for me.'' In addition to his brother's involvement with the Philharmonic his father Mehli Mehta a violinist and conductor studied in New York in the 1940's. A cousin Bejun Mehta is a countertenor who as a boy soprano sang for Leonard Bernstein.By contrast Zarin Mehta who was born in Bombay entered the music world as an accountant. Trained in England he sought an accounting job in New York in 1962 but was turned away for fear he might head back to Europe or go to Canada to escape the Vietnam-era draft. He did move to Canada to work for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand and joined the board of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra becoming its vice president. In 1981 he was named managing director and served until 1990 when he took over the Ravinia Festival.His musical training was nil he said proudly. ''My parents successfully kept me away from it'' he said. For his administrative duties he said ''accounting is better than being an oboe player.'' He said he looked forward to working with Mr. Masur and if plans jelled with Mr. Muti. ''It's a very strange marriage music director and executive director'' he said. ''They're jointly responsible. They have to be thinking along the same lines.''Could he have worked with his brother Zubin? He didn't pause to consider it. ''We would have fought tooth and nail'' he said.As for his plans for changes at the Philharmonic he said it would be presumptuous to speak of that yet. But he had one priority. ''I want to attend a parks concert'' he said.

 0,WASHINGTON — With Christine Lagarde the current leader of the International Monetary Fund poised to become the next president of the European Central Bank the big questions on Wednesday were who would succeed her and whether the United States would break with tradition and try to install an American in the post.On Tuesday European officials nominated Ms. Lagarde to succeed Mario Draghi as the European Central Bank’s president. Ms. Lagarde a stabilizing force who has lent star power to the monetary fund since taking over as its managing director in 2011 plans to step away from her responsibilities while the nomination process moves forward.The expected transition of power at the fund comes as the global economy slows and protectionism increases amid President Trump’s multifront trade war. The next director of the fund will have to confront economic woes in Argentina Venezuela and Turkey as well as take over the kind of multilateral institution that Mr. Trump has long criticized as overstepping its authority.“The key challenge for the next I.M.F. head is how to maintain the institution’s relevance influence and legitimacy in a world where multilateralism is breaking down amid trade tensions and shifting geopolitical alliances” said Eswar Prasad the former head of the monetary fund’s China division. “The I.M.F. is the epitome of multilateralism in international finance but it suffers from marginalization by the key advanced economies a pool of resources dwarfed by global capital flows and lack of trust among emerging market economies.”

 9,After meeting with Charles Oakley and his representatives on Thursday Dave Checketts the Knicks' president remains hopeful that Oakley will report to training camp starting Friday.Checketts plans to meet with Oakley's representatives again before camp. Oakley unhappy that he is locked into a contract with four years remaining that will pay him $2.2 million this season has threatened not to report. Oakley is seeking an extension at the end of his current deal a one-year balloon payment in the neighborhood of $10 million. The Knicks reportedly offered the forward a one-year $4 million extension months ago that Oakley rejected. But while the two sides have not come to terms Checketts said his meeting with Oakley was a positive step.I think I understand where Charles is coming from" Checketts said. "I'm concerned about his situation just like I'm concerned about anything that comes up. Charles has been respectful and no one has told me yet that he's definitely not coming to camp."Asked how upsetting it would be if Oakley a co-captain did not report Checketts said: "I'm not going to speculate on that at this point. Obviously Charles Oakley is a very very important part of our team."

 9,Philip (Slim) Connelly was Los Angeles editor of a West Coast Communist newspaper The People's World when he was arrested and jailed in July 1951 in a roundup of Communist Party leaders in California. After a six-month trial in 1952 he and 13 other men and women were found guilty of having violated the Smith Act of 1940 which made it a crime to conspire to teach or advocate the overthrow of the Government by force.It was only the second major test for the legislation as applied to Communists the first having resulted in the conviction of 11 Communist Party officials in 1949 after a nine-month trial in New York.In the Los Angeles case the defendants asserted that they had merely advocated transition to Communism by peaceful means as far as the United States was concerned. Nevertheless a jury found them guilty and they were each sentenced to five years in prison and a $10000 fine.In 1955 an attorney for the defendants appealed to the United States Supreme Court filing a petition that contended the convictions were a violation of constitutional guarantees offreedom of the press. The Court overturned the sentences but Mr. Connelly continued to be denounced by members of Congress. Charges in Congressional Report
 0,We also lived like nomads. Local Berbers built traditional tents that housed up to eight competitors between stages. There weren’t any toilets. We used plastic bags and peed in plain sight of one another.How do runners prepare for the Marathon des Sables? I ran a lot including the Badwater Cape Fear 51.4-mile race to get comfortable with sand running. I tested and retested my gear. I read race reports. I sweated in the sauna. And I trained my gut to become accustomed to dehydrated food: Every day for three months I ate instant mashed potatoes after I ran.It took almost no time to realize how ineffectively I had prepared for the Marathon des Sables.I could feel the Sahara laughing at me. The mesh in my shoes let in fine sand causing me to shake out large amounts every few miles. At the end of the first day I begged at the medical tent for tape to cover the tops of my shoes. Before turning me away one French doctor peered into my eyes and said “I treat people not shoes.” I noticed that people who complained of sore shoulders were receiving lots of tape. And so began my daily ritual of feigning shoulder pain to solve my shoe problem.Image Nathan DeWall used extra tape on his shoes each day to keep the Sahara desert sand from seeping through the mesh. Credit... Nathan DeWallThe first stage acclimated us to the desert and our living conditions. We also learned the race’s grave risks. To start the race you have to show a race doctor an EKG that was taken within 30 days of the start of the race and jeeps and helicopters were on standby to take people to nearby hospitals if needed. One man experienced cardiac arrest at a water checkpoint. His training partner howled in horror. The doctors revived him with CPR. His race was over but he left with his life.The next two days involved dozens of miles of climbing and descending sand dunes and mountains. When I reached the top of a rocky climb I celebrated by giving one of my tent mates a high five. Ian Corless a British photographer and founder of the Talk Ultra podcast shot me a grin and said “Get ready for the fun part.”
 0,About a month ago the Denver Broncos’ starting cornerback Darrent Williams said he looked forward to returning to Fort Worth Tex. in the off-season to warn young people in his hometown about staying away from violence and drugs. Williams never got home. Hours after the Broncos lost to the San Francisco 49ers to be knocked from the playoff race Williams was shot to death in what the police said was a drive-by shooting in downtown Denver early on New Year’s Day.Williams 24 was riding in a stretch Hummer limousine early this morning when just after 2 a.m. a vehicle pulled up beside the moving limousine and sprayed it with gunfire. Three people including Williams an unidentified man and an unidentified woman were hit inside the limousine. The man whom police said was not a Broncos player was treated and released. The woman remained in the hospital but her injuries are not considered life-threatening and the police said she will be released in a few days.In a midday briefing Monday held just feet from where the bullet-riddled Hummer remained after it veered into a snowbank after the shooting the Denver police said that an argument broke out at a nightclub where Williams and others were attending a New Year’s Eve party. The club is a few blocks from the site of the shooting. The altercation was not directly between Williams and someone else said the police spokesman Sonny Jackson but between two groups of people — one of them Williams’s group — and did not involve a physical confrontation. The police spokesman said other people had been in the limousine but were not injured. He declined to identify them.Several Denver-area news organizations reported that Broncos wide receiver Javon Walker was in the limousine. There were as many as a dozen bullet holes visible in the limousine and one window was blown out. The police are looking for a large white sports utility vehicle — a Suburban or Tahoe — with darkly tinted windows that they believe was involved in the shooting.Advertisement Continue reading the main story“We don’t believe that it’s random” Jackson said.The police do not believe any shots were fired from Williams’s limousine and they found no weapons inside the limousine Jackson said.

First there are labels like the movie star Reese Witherspoon’s clothing line Draper James (which is as its website tell us “steeped in Southern charm”). And then there are a handful of local labels inspired not by down-home hospitality but the region itself: hardscrabble indefatigable and ever-changing.

 9,To the Editor:''President Reagan's Drug Bust'' (editorial Nov. 13) makes I feel several pivotal errors in its position on marijuana.Specifically you assert that marijuana's potential health hazards are ''on a par with those of tobacco and alcohol.'' Is this an attempt to legitimize the use of marijuana by playing down the adverse effects of tobacco and alcohol? If so it must be pointed out that smoking remains the single most preventable cause of disease in the United States. Moreover the most widely abused drug with the gravest public health implications (e.g. vehicular accidents homicides suicides) continues to be alcohol. These two substances contribute to the premature death of more than a half-million Americans every year.As for marijuana scientific studies clearly establish a number of negative health consequences associated with its use. For example marijuana smoke contains even more carcinogens and lung irritants than does tobacco. In the short term marijuana can disrupt thinking learning and remembering. High doses can cause hallucinations and create anxiety.Marijuana use leads to as much as a 50 percent short-term increase in heart rate can decrease the blood supply to the heart and cause chest pains. It affects glands and hormones involved in reproduction and may impair sexual development fertility and functioning.

 9,President Bush met with Prime Minister Li Peng of China today for the first time since Mr. Li presided over Beijing's crackdown on democracy campaigners in 1989.Mr. Bush went ahead with the chilly 20-minute encounter despite critics' charges that even a brief meeting would buttress the international standing of the Chinese Government and Mr. Li. The President contends that such contacts are worthwhile as a means of tempering Beijing's behavior through dialogue. Hundreds of people protested against the meeting outside.The meeting took place in a conference room here after both leaders attended the summit meeting of leaders of nations represented on the Security Council.Barely an hour before they met the State Department issued its annual worldwide human rights report in which China was accused of an array of abuses and described as a repressive regime "falling far short of internationally accepted norms."

 9,To the Editor:With its double-page advertisement on March 21 Moscow seems eager to inform the American public of the latest policy decisions taken by the Soviet Government. General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his address to the 27th party congress proclaimed as a fundamental principle the ''settlement in a humane and positive spirit of the questions related to the reunification of families marriage and promotion of contacts between people and organizations.''As one of more than 20 Americans married or engaged to Soviet citizens and unable to be reunited with our loved ones I am encouraged by this statement. After a 12-year relationship my own marriage was blocked in 1979 and I have been unable to see my Soviet fiance for over six years. I hope this Soviet declaration represents a genuine commitment to re-unite separated spouses and fiances.Certainly one positive step toward promoting trust and understanding between our two nations could be accomplished if the Russians follow this policy statement with concrete actions.

 9,In his 20-year career at Aetna Life and Casualty in Hartford Hoyt J. Goodrich figures he has invested about $4 billion of the insurance company's money. Now Mr. Goodrich has joined Donald P. Remey in a new company called Bridge Capital Advisors Inc. to do some investing on their own.Mr. Goodrich 46 said Bridge Capital would invest in private placement financings for small and medium-sized companies. ''We have an idea to help them out'' he said.The idea is a fixed rate loan at below market rates in exchange for which Bridge has the right to buy equity or to have a convertible feature. It is called debt with an equity play.''We're not trying to be as risky as venture capital firms but we're on the aggressive side of what insurance companies have traditionally been doing'' he said.
 9,To the Editor:Stephen J. Gould (Op-Ed May 29) argues that a biological window on human behavior provides little help in the search for sensible political structures. He thus must either believe that biology tells us little about human behavior or that human behavior does not much constrain our politics. But he cannot believe the first without rejecting the main proposition of Darwinism that man is an animal shaped by natural selection. He cannot believe the second without rejecting political philosophers like James Madison who rested his support for the Constitution on his analysis of human nature.Mr. Gould's view that the biology of sexuality and aging is largely irrelevant to politics makes one wonder what he would consider in making social policy. For example if sexuality is such a powerful urge that men often do not think through its consequences the absence of institutions like child support will allow them to transfer the costs of their acts to society.JOHN O. MCGINNISTurin Italy May 29 1998

 0,For a generation Indonesian journalists knew better than to write about business and government corruption. The country's dictator Suharto would close down the publication and throw the editor or reporter in jail.The dictator is gone -- five years now -- and news organizations are still trying to find their role in a democracy at times indulging in unbridled excess. But in a country that is widely viewed by the World Bank and foreign businessmen as among the most corrupt the rich and powerful have a new tactic in their battle against the press: libel actions.The latest verdict in late January stunned many Indonesians. A court ordered one of the country's most respected newspapers Koran Tempo to pay $1 million to a prominent businessman Tomy Winata.The judges said the newspaper had insulted Mr. Winata by suggesting that he had sought a casino license in one province and might be looking at another location for one. Gambling is illegal here.

 9,GREENWICH Conn. Oct. 31 —The 15‐year‐old daughter of a Greenwich executive was found bludgeoned to death this afternoon in a clump of bushes 200 feet from her home in the exclusive Belle Haven estate section here.The body of the girl Martha ITVIoxley still clad in the blue ski !parka and blue dungarees she wore when she left home last !night to visit friends was found ‘shortly after noon today by Sheila McGuire. a 15‐year‐old ‘neighbor and classmate of the dead girl at Greenwich High School.Thomas Keegan detective captain of the Greenwich police said Miss Moxley had apIparently been killed by a blow to the back of the head in an attack that took place not more than a few feet from the Moxley home.The body of Miss Moxley who was 5 feet 5 inches tall weighed 120 pounds and had long blond hair was then apparently dragged to a nearby clump of bushes where it remained undiscovered for hours despite an intensive search of the estate and surrounding neighborhood by policemen who were alerted by the victim's mother Dorothy at 3:45 A.M.
 9,Novelists will say that one reason their work is so agonizing is that no one out there is waiting for what they do; they have to create their own welcome in the world.A cross-country bicyclist feels much the same way.For a New Yorker heading home on two wheels from the West Coast the nation looms Tolstoyan. O.K. maybe that's inappropriate; maybe Melvillian is better. Or Hemingwayesque. Epic anyway.Epic or short story beginnings are always a problem but how is this for the height of inauspiciousness? Somewhere between New York and Oakland Calif. where bicycle and bicyclist were to be reunited after a Westward journey by rail Amtrak lost the bike.This is something that never happens said Gary L. Rose the Amtrak official in charge of baggage and ticketing for Northern California. Occasionally packages are delayed he said or sometimes a parcel gets mistakenly rerouted to an improper destination. "But I don't know how that happens with something as big as a bike" Mr. Rose said.

 0,The diaries are an English equivalent of Spalding Gray's monologues a stream of highly personalized mordant conversations with himself. In ''The Smoking Diaries'' he writes about the plight of playwrights: they ''work in solitude then expose the work of their solitude in an indecently public manner.'' He says he likes the first part not the second. In a wry aside he writes that he regards himself as ''a negative reverse alchemist in that I take the dross of my life and turn it into something drossier.'' At the core of the book are his obsessions. Drinking four bottles of Champagne a day he became an acute alcoholic. About eight years ago as he took one last sip of Champagne he felt his life draining away and he fell into a coma. After weeks in delirium in a hospital he gave up drinking.Smoking was another matter. He has been ''a heavy smoker'' since he was 7 and when it was suggested that that is an extraordinarily early age he said ''I think in Cambodia children start smoking at 3 or 4.'' His parents were also a lifelong smokers. On her deathbed his mother finally vowed not to have another cigarette.When Mr. Gray had a bout with prostate cancer he went to a urologist who smoked. ''My sort of urologist'' he said.After his friend Ian Hamilton the biographer died and Mr. Pinter was found to have esophageal cancer (after surgery he recovered) Mr. Gray began writing another diary to keep his mind off these personal tragedies not intending it for publication. Part of it was printed in Granta leading to the book.In a profession in which the writer is at the whim of producers and critics he is a true survivor undiminished in his enthusiasm for theater even as he wonders why his plays are not performed more often.Two fairly recent ones ''Simply Disconnected'' (a sequel to ''Otherwise Engaged'') and ''The Late Middle Classes'' (a poignant memory play inspired by his childhood) have never been staged in London. And ''Butley'' for one is still so identified with Bates who died in December that it is not often revived. Nathan Lane however did it last year at the Huntington Theater in Boston and there are plans to bring it to Broadway next season.What could improve London theater? Without pause Mr. Gray said ''It's capitalism profit and loss and there's not much you can say about that.'' On the other hand there is ''the subsidized theater which has altered the equation'' except in his own case. He has had trouble connecting with Britain's major theaters. ''If only I'd had a gift for basic diplomacy'' he says in his book he might ''at least have got my plays returned more speedily by Trevor Nunn'' then director of the National Theater.
 0,And here’s another one from the Bad Customer Service Files: a guy who recorded his phone call to AOL in an attempt to cancel his AOL account.Frankly I find the caller pretty discourteous but the lengths to which the AOL rep went to prevent the cancellation really are pretty amazing.(Once the call became public online AOL issued an apology. “At AOL we have zero-tolerance for customer care incidents like this…the employee cited here is no longer with the Company.”)Listen up AOL: we all know that the dial-up era is ending. Offhand I don’t know exactly what your salvation will be. But I can tell you pretty confidently that trying to argue your customers out of canceling isn’t the big answer.
 9,He is considered an extremely capable and tough officer—“the best they have” one American analyst said.With his arrival at Tan Son Nhut Air Base where the Communist delegations are quartered and working the four chief delegates are now all present. The North Vietnamese leader Maj. Gen. Le Quang Hoa arrived Monday.Officials close to the military commission said that yesterday's session which was attended only by the deputy heads of the delegations showed a marked improvement in atmosphere over the three previous days when the Vietcong delegates had at first refused to present their credentials.“I've been quite heartened by the progress” one official said. The official who said he could give no details of the meetings because of strict orders to keep the sessions secret added that he expected the military commission might now be able to start sending out its seven regional inspection teams “perhaps by early next week.”The Paris agreement specified that the seven regional teams were to be in place by last Tuesday.It was also believed that the four heads of the delegations would hold their first formal meeting today. So far only their deputies have met.The North Vietnamese and Vietcong delegates who are living in a ramshackle compound of former United States Army barracks inside the air base have been carefully guarded oy South Vietnamese military police and have had no contact with either ordinary. South Vietnamese or with the press.Yesterday however according to a reliable United States official the North Vietnamese requested permission to visit a market off the base “to get some fresh fruit and vegetables.” The Communist reportedly said they were satisfied with the South Vietnamese military rations they have been fed but would appreciate a change in diet.
 0,Stocks End Second Quarter With Best Gains Since 1998The stock market posted its best quarterly performance since the end of 1998 producing the most encouraging rally since the long slide began in 2000.The 14.9 percent climb in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the three months was the eighth-best quarterly performance since World War II. The 12.4 percent increase in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 21 percent gain in the Nasdaq composite index resulted in their best quarters since the last three months of 2001. Although technology stocks led the way the breadth of the rebound was enormous.

 0,The makers of the Samsung SH100 digital camera are taking a literal approach to product placement in a marketing campaign that starts on Monday.The campaign called the Samsung Coast to Coast Photo Post will put a single SH100 into the hands of people in 25 cities across the country so they can use it to post photos on various social media sites like Facebook YouTube and Picasa. The campaign is intended to highlight the camera’s ability to instantly upload photos to the Web something that an increasing number of cellphone cameras already do.“We know consumers are increasingly sharing content” said Reid Sullivan the company’s senior vice president for mobile entertainment for the United States adding that the quality of cellphone camera photos is no match for the Samsung device.Samsung teamed up with the digital agency Mekanism to create the campaign which is scheduled to start in Los Angeles and end in New York City at the end of the month. The initiative represents the first time the brand and the agency have worked together.In order to pass the single camera from city to city a small team from Samsung will visit each location and hand over the device to a person they have deemed a “social influencer” for the day. The goal is to create “little snapshots of Americana” Mr. Sullivan said.Representatives from Mekanism will document the approximately 3600-mile journey in user-generated photographs and the collection will be shown at a gallery event in June in New York City. The photo that generates the most “likes” on Facebook will be deemed the best of the bunch. Additional promotions will include product demonstration videos on YouTube in-store dealer promotions and newspaper ads.

 0,A heroic dog and cat were serenaded by a singing dog during the ASPCA awards banquet today where they were honored for saving their owners’ lives.The dog a 2-year-old golden retriever named Toby performed a modified Heimlich maneuver on his owner Debbie Parkhurst of North East Md. when she choked on a piece of apple. Toby pushed her to the floor and jumped up and down on Ms. Parkhurst’s chest until he dislodged the piece of apple.The cat a 14-year-old domestic shorthair named Winnie saved the Keesling family of New Castle Ind. in March from carbon monoxide poisoning by jumping on a bed and meowing wildly as poisonous carbon monoxide fumes filled the family’s home from a faulty gasoline-powered water pump in the the basement.Winnie woke up Cathy Keesling by nuzzling her ear and caterwauling. When Ms. Keesling got out of bed she was nauseated and unable to wake her husband. She called 911 and paramedics found the couple’s 14-year-old son unconscious on the floor near his bedroom.At the banquet held at the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center Winnie and Toby did not get their own seats nor apparently their own plates of food (though Winnie sneaked shrimp out of the salad course).Entertainment was provided by Oliver the dog owned by Chuck Scarborough the WNBC news anchorman who was the M.C. of the awards program.Oliver sang along to music from a harmonica played by Mr. Scarborough’s nephew.The honorees traveled fairly substantial distances to receive their honors. Winnie flew into La Guardia Airport and Toby drove up from Maryland. City Room will observe they were both smart to avoid Kennedy Airport which has not been a kind environment for dogs or cats of late.
 0,UPDATE: Google has responded again to the firestorm raised by this incident saying it shares the concerns Michael Moore raised in his movie.For a while this weekend it looked like Google had chosen to insert itself in the middle of the national debate over healthcare and take on controversial filmmaker Michael Moore.In an official corporate blog a Google employee criticized Mr. Moore’s movie Sicko as one-sided: “Moore’s film portrays the industry as money and marketing driven and fails to show healthcare’s interest in patient well-being and care” wrote Lauren Turner a Health Account Planner at Google.Ms. Turner went on to suggest that Google could help much-maligned health care companies to “Get the Facts” out. How? By buying ads on Google of course.By Sunday after her post raised some eyebrows in the blogosphere Ms. Turner clarified that the opinion about Sicko was hers not Google’s. “Some readers thought the opinion I expressed about the movie Sicko was actually Google’s opinion” she wrote. “It’s easy to understand why it might have seemed that way because after all this is a corporate blog. So that was my mistake — I understand why it caused some confusion.”A Google spokesman told me much the same.But Ms. Turner also said that she stood by her earlier comments that Google stood ready to help anyone whether the healthcare industry or Mr. Moore’s himself: “Whether the healthcare industry wants to rebut charges in Mr. Moore’s movie or whether Mr. Moore wants to challenge the healthcare industry advertising is a very democratic and effective way to participate in a public dialogue” she wrote.That said it’s not clear that Mr. Moore needs to spend money on Google to get his message out.

 0,Both winners were a testament to how deep the United States moguls team is and how difficult selecting only seven athletes for the Olympic squad is going to be. Right now Moseley the defending Olympic gold medalist is on the outside looking in after his ninth-place finish today.''At this point I'm in trouble'' said Moseley who has one top-10 World Cup finish this season and is well behind the front-runner Jeremy Bloom. ''I've got four World Cups to go.''Moseley hopes that the more the judges see the dinner roll -- a move that would be illegal if his feet went over his head for an inverted aerial -- the better his chances of scoring well. If they do not come to accept the jump Moseley will have to decide whether he will go back to the blah-blah basics to give himself a shot at making the Olympic team.''I'll either have to change or go to the X Games'' he said.He has made a good living off his flamboyant style and Hollywood smile parlaying his Olympic gold in 1998 in Nagano Japan into film work. But his comeback has been frustrating and the talent on the men's team has proved deeper than most expected.Bloom has come out of nowhere to stand on two World Cup podiums. His decision to defer his football scholarship at the University of Colorado to try out for the Olympic team has paid off. The 19-year-old Bloom used veteran caution and held back today finishing fifth as he nursed a groin injury.

 9,Two weeks ago when Sunset Park residents heard that the new captain of the 72d Precinct Thomas Palazzo was slated to be transferred they immediately began planning a way to keep him.In his first three months community leaders say the captain had begun improving the previously strained communications between the residents and the police."The community wants the relationship to be a partnership" said Councilwoman Joan Griffin McCabe whose district includes Sunset Park. "I think people feel that kind of confidence in Palazzo."Residents flooded police officials with telephone calls and wrote a letter to the Police Commissioner William J. Bratton in support of the captain. They also planned a demonstration in front of the precinct house. The precinct also includes Windsor Terrace.
 9,Mr. Hatch has scheduled a committee vote on Mr. Lee for Thursday and Congressional officials say it is uncertain whether Mr. Lee can muster the 10 votes needed to send the nomination to the Senate floor. He presumably has support from the eight Democrats on the committee and maybe from one Repubican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.Republican Senators and other conservatives who say the Administration's civil rights policies are too liberal oppose Mr. Lee because of his unwillingness to disassociate himself from positions he took as the Western Regional Director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund a liberal civil rights group on affirmative action and school busing.''We think that we have a decent chance of beating this nomination'' said Clint Bolick vice president for litigation of the Institute for Justice a conservative group that opposes Mr. Lee. ''This is the one opportunity that the Senate has to express its outrage over the Clinton Administration's civil rights policies. Lee exemplifies an activist pro-racial-preferences agenda. So this seems the right opportunity.''The machinations around Mr. Lee are not unusual for a nominee to the top civil rights post which has been a lightning rod for debate on some of the most contentious social issues the country faces including busing affirmative action and gay rights. Mr. Lee is the first person nominated to the post since the Republicans took over the Senate in 1994.The choice of Mr. Lee is shaping up as a battle between the increasingly conservative Senate and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund an organization that has supplied the last four Democratic nominees for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights: Drew Days Lani Guinier Deval Patrick and now Mr. Lee.In written questions Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have sought to learn whether Mr. Lee would change his ways in his new job.''There are several Republicans who are concerned'' a Republican staff member said. ''While he did say he would just enforce the law if confirmed given his answers and testimony and his failure to distinguish the positions he would take as head of Civil Rights Division from those he took at the NAACP I think Republican senators have cause to question what his positions would be.''

 0,This is Alice Mathias somehow magically reporting for a not-student-run news organization from the trenches of my senior spring at Dartmouth College. For the past four years I have been studying in a safe town-sized bubble in the New Hampshire wilderness and on June 10th this bubble is scheduled to burst at which point along with (most of) the class of 2007 I will be catapulted into adulthood.When we were kids my friends and I played a game called MASH. This game forecast whether we would grow up to live in Mansions Apartments Shacks or Houses what our jobs would be where in the world we would live which of our celebrity crushes we would marry and most importantly what kind of pet we would have. All we had to do was pick a number 1 through 10 and our destinies would unfold before our eyes. If we didn’t like these destinies we could just play the game again.Back in our MASH days our dream jobs were firefighting I-banking sales and trading consulting wealth management mergers and acquisitions and real estate finance. We wanted to live in the Upper East Side the Upper West Side Greenwich or Great Neck. We understood that if we failed to find true love after the first shot we could marry/divorce every crush on our lists. The pet issue was the only one that was really up for grabs. (I’m still crossing my fingers for that designer Labradoodle.)O.K. fine –– no one actually knew what “I-banking” meant when we were kids. We still don’t understand the specifics but roughly translated it means: “getting rich.” Whatever it is a stunning percentage of my generation’s most promising brainiacs are doing it. They could be curing diseases or discovering alternative energy sources or living at their parents’ houses but instead they are making millions for the Man over at the bank-tank.The banker plague is spread by a phenomenon known as corporate recruiting. Every year serious New York guys in coats and ties descend on college campuses and convince the smartest kids that the surefire way to afford a castle on the moon is by crunching numbers at places like J.P. Bored-Again Bored-Again Stanley Merrill Lynching Deutsche Bag or Lame-Man Brothers. The other option is to do consulting at Bane. (Note: these are fake names. Real names have been withheld to ward off any more competition for my well-paying job.)I-Banking would seem to be a suitable ambition for I-vy League members of what has been coined the “I-Generation” for more reasons than are initially apparent. (The I-thing!) Sure we all want to be able to buy iPods for our kids or celebrity spouses or designer pets. Yes the Internet has made us realize that there is a lot of competition out there for hip apartments and e-Bay’s limited edition “Virgin Mary’s Face in a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.” All that said I don’t think that the class of 2007’s huge population of econ majors is a direct symptom of our insatiable appetite for “stuff” (that edible relic would surely be filling enough).I respect my many bank-bent peers who feel the need to make a lot of money for one glaringly freaky reason. In a speech to first-year Dartmouth students an engineering professor who was lecturing about genetics said (with a completely straight face): “it is completely conceivable that [his generation] is among the last of generations to ever experience natural biological aging and death.” Basically this not-joking genius told everyone that thanks (or no thanks) to science the class of 2007 might be (drum roll please) I-mmortal! (No not the baddum-ching kind of drum roll. This is not a joke: we might get really freakishly old.)All we’ll have to do is pop a few fountain-of-youth geltabs at night before brushing our teeth and eternity will be ours. The only catch is that we will still have to outrun those “unnatural” causes of aging and death.My class is graduating into a world that is changing faster than ever before. We’re living in a weird society today that will most assuredly be weirder tomorrow. By the time my generation takes over the reins we’ll be steering an entirely different pony. Probably a robotic pony. (Oops! That Labradoodle just got bucked off my wish list.)Being a citizen led by a contentious bipartisan government is like being the child of divorced parents (something that my generation knows a lot about.) As ordinary civilians we are the nearly powerless witnesses to a lot of problem-pushing and finger-pointing. There is a big split but no matter what we are somehow still a family.The class of 2007 has grown up trying to reconcile Papa Bush’s crusade against terrorism with Mama Gore’s videotaped PowerPoints insisting that global warming is a bigger threat to our well-being. The “adults” have instructed us to prepare for attacks and floods and polar bear holocausts. These competitors for our affection all trumpet different versions of Armageddon and seem to agree on just one thing: that the kids aren’t going to be safe.Hurricane Katrina and the war in Iraq have underscored the notion that money is the common citizen’s only viable safety net. It doesn’t take an econ major to recognize basic applications of supply and demand. When helicopter rides out of danger zones become limited they go to the rich. When the American Army finds itself with limited resources it goes to the poor. If my classmates and I are going to live forever we can expect to face many natural and man-made disasters. If these problems are not somehow avoided it seems they will be escaped only by those who can afford a one-way ticket to that castle on the moon.We won’t need to worry about not being immortal if we can elect the right leadership. For as long as I can remember I have been moving back and forth between the Bush and Clinton White Houses. My peers and I know no other presidents. The family ideals of America’s Montagues and Capulets have trickled down and shaped the graduating class that we are today –– that is they have shaped us into a class that is by and large turned off by the idea of growing up to be politicians. All the smartest kids in the room have instead elected to go Mr. Moneybags à la Monopoly.I don’t mean to make an all-encompassing declaration of doom. The truth is that many of my clever peers have snuck through the corporate cracks and will ideally make a big difference in other arenas of society maybe even in politics. Things are already looking up. Somehow the Democrats have recently found a smart guy who is miraculously dumb enough to want to be president. He’s hip too. Maybe he’ll start a smart-politician trend. If he doesn’t manage to sway intelligent young people into pursuing politics at least we can count on him to inspire political engagement in the crush category of MASH games across America.

 9,"Slow Art: Painting in New York Now" is a big easygoing show that looks pretty good on first encounter but gets worse the more you think about it. Ambitious in size it fills nearly 20 big galleries at the P.S. 1 Museum in Long Island City Queens with canvases by more than 100 New York City artists which makes it the biggest contemporary painting show here in many years. It is also exceedingly well timed coming at the end of a season in which the so-called "return" of painting has been a hot topic and the subject of several gallery shows and panel discussions.The title suggests that painting is a slow contemplative tradition and that the show will provide an antidote to those supposedly speedier art forms -- sculpture photography and Conceptualism -- which have dominated the New York scene for the past few seasons. It has been organized by Alanna Heiss the founding director of P.S. 1 and the painters she has chosen span several generations numerous styles and nearly every degree of reputation from world-famous artists like Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein to virtual unknowns both old and young.But while "Slow Art" reaches suggestively in several directions at once encompassing both geometric and Expressionistic forms of abstraction both realistic and folk-artsy figuration it never assumes an intelligible shape. It omits some of painting's most prominent practitioners -- David Salle and Robert Ryman for example -- while ignoring some of the medium's more striking recent developments on both the abstract and feminist fronts. In any number of ways it fails to live up to its emphatic definitive-sounding subtitle "Painting in New York Now" blowing a golden opportunity to assess the medium's current condition.Ms. Heiss lets herself off the hook early. In marked contrast to the subtitle a blurb on the checklist describes the exhibition as a " 'working' show rather than a comprehensive survey" that is a "subjective -- even visceral -- curatorial selection." It is as if the curator is saying that the show is incomplete and that her organizing principles and standards of judgment cannot be explained. It also suggests a sense of capriciousness that is borne out by the show itself.

 0,On July 18 Premier League club Sunderland revealed its new home uniform.The shirt was not particularly noteworthy. After all there is only so much you can do with red and white stripes. But those famous colors — Sunderland remains the last striped team to win the title in a English top division — were adorned with a new and unusual sponsor: Invest in Africa. This unique and controversial deal is causing plenty of debate.Invest in Africa is a not-for-profit “partnership of companies” with the declared aim of “promoting Africa as open for business by challenging misconceptions and inspiring new investors.” The organization boasts of an African middle class of 300000000 which is “soon to be bigger than the entire populations of Brazil and Russia combined.” As a result the publicity material reads Africa is the “world’s best-kept investment secret.”The company asserts that a shirt sponsorship with Sunderland is a “unique opportunity to use the global reach of the Premier League to help spread prosperity across Africa and bring new opportunities to local businesses.” In return Sunderland will apparently “build its fan base and global brand particularly in Africa where nearly 300 million people watch Premier League matches.”When the deal was first announced in late June four men posed outside Sunderland’s Stadium of Light. The club’s owner the Texan Ellis Short spoke of a “sponsor that will allow us to grow our market share worldwide.” David Miliband MP Sunderland vice-chairman and the former British foreign secretary hollered “Join us help build Invest in Africa and reap the benefits.” Midfielder Craig Gardner grinned and posed with a soccer ball. The fourth man was Aidan Heavey Tullow Oil chief executive and a man with a huge role to play.Tullow Oil operates in 15 African countries and is the “continent’s leading independent oil company.” Tullow is the founding partner of Invest in Africa and as yet the only investor in the initiative. While Invest in Africa and Tullow are technically separate entities the name on Sunderland’s shirt is exclusively financed by the oil company.Since its founding in 1985 Tullow has found a huge amount of oil. The company will soon begin extraction in Uganda (where it estimates reserves of up to 2.5 billion barrels) and recently made new discoveries in Kenya.While the “scramble for Africa’s oil” continues with ferocity Tullow’s role in the rush for resources has been criticized. In February Foreign Policy magazine reported on “Uganda’s oil scandal” and the “complete absence of corporate social responsibility on the part of Tullow” where villagers had been driven off their land with no compensation. Tullow was accused of paying millions of dollars of bribes to Ugandan officials. Tullow denied the allegations and took the unusual step of publishing supporting documents on its Web site.Deep concerns with the allocation of oil resources and corruption however persist.After the announcement of Sunderland’s Invest in Africa deal there was some negative reaction in Britain. The London-based N.G.O. Platform saw the arrangement as Tullow “framing its drilling operations in the rhetoric of growth and development.” After this The Independent published an article on the “concerns over the suitability of Sunderland’s new sponsor.”Tullow once again reacted quickly to the criticism with its head of media relations giving a series of interviews to the Sunderland fan site Roker Report. In these posts George Cazenove answers questions on exclusion zones for fishermen around oil rigs corporate social responsibility and transparency.Cazenove responded to the coverage with: “The guys who put together these comments about Tullow are anti-oil and anti-oil in Africa and they don’t believe that oil companies should be operating in Africa. That’s fine that’s their perspective there’s a perfectly coherent intellectual argument to support that. There’s an equally coherent argument on our side that drilling for oil in Africa and doing business in Africa which we’ve done successfully for 26 years is a good thing.”Sunderland supporters meanwhile are divided. Many have been seduced by the financial possibilities for the club as Miliband asserted in an interview saying “It’s the best commercial deal in Sunderland’s history.” Others feel much more concerned. Some have pointed out that the reputation of the club is now aligned with that of the African oil industry. Many feel morally compromised by the positive language of Invest in Africa and the more complicated situation with Tullow Oil. Some acutely aware of their place in the soccer ecosystem simply do not believe the hype. During the launch Heavey said “At a stroke this association will make Sunderland the most popular club in Africa.” That seems unlikely.In the past Sunderland’s sponsors have been local brewers car dealers and online bingo companies. This big international deal for a midranking club shows how branding and business development dominate the Premier League at all levels. If Sunderland increases its “market share” in Africa successfully enough it may be able to rise a few places up a league already clogged with money. It remains to be seen how many more partners will join Invest in Africa how Ugandan corruption will be dealt with and how much damage the oil industry may do to the people politics and environment of Africa.Ed Upright is a freelance journalist based in New York City.

Why he wondered had she explained a new math concept in such a roundabout way? If only she had laid it out like this he recalls thinking reworking the lesson in his head then we would have understood it immediately.This was not the first time Mr. Fisher had pondered the art of teaching and learning. In fact he had been tutoring his classmates since the previous year having discovered that he had a knack for explaining concepts so the other kids understood them.A slender fellow with a goatee and a mass of curly hair Mr. Fisher 34 still tutors students. Only today his students are seeking higher test scores -- and his tutorials cost $375 to $425 an hour.Mr. Fisher is among about 100 tutors working for Advantage Testing Inc. an Upper East Side test preparation firm. He joined nine years ago with no formal teaching experience but a master's degree in music from Juilliard and a Harvard physics degree and is now one of the firm's most senior tutors. He says he consistently raises SAT scores by more than 200 points and achieves similar results in graduate school exams.

 0,Detective Jennings's arm was in such pain this week from the shot that she could barely lift it. Her boss insisted she see a doctor but her thoughts were on her fiancé Robert Bolin also a detective who will remain behind watching after their house and caring for their rabbit three dogs and three cats. With war looming their wedding has been indefinitely postponed.''A sailor asked me 'How do you feel knowing that you would live but your fiancé would die?' '' Detective Jennings 32 said of a possible anthrax attack on the United States. ''That is devastating to think about. The realization of going to war is slapping people on the side of the head.''In Goodland Kan. residents lost their only Spanish-speaking doctor -- and the town's sole woman practitioner -- when Dr. Natalie Griego was activated by the Army National Guard. In addition to saying goodbye to her husband and her 22-month-old son Dr. Griego left behind hundreds of distraught patients including many expectant mothers.She saw about 25 patients daily at Rural Health Ventures the clinic where she worked with two other physicians and she also saw patients in a hospital a nursing home and a facility for the mentally handicapped. Shawna Blanka 32 of St. Francis Kan. had been driving 45 miles for her prenatal care. Mrs. Blanka is eight months pregnant.''When I first found out she was leaving I just wanted to cry to be honest'' Mrs. Blanka said. ''I've been a little stressed over it and this is not a good time to be stressed either.''Dr. Griego was given only 24 hours' notice to report for duty yet more than 200 people gathered in Goodland for a farewell party.

 0,INDIANAPOLIS — If Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski can’t play in Super Bowl XLVI because of a high ankle sprain there might not be anyone to fill his shoes.It feels like tempting fate for the Patriots who streamrolled the league with their dual threats — Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez — but they have no other tight ends on the active roster. Carson Butler has been stashed on the practice squad for 16 months.The New England tight ends coach Brian Ferentz agrees that it is an odd situation.“You are living a little dangerously at times when most of our offense is geared toward having two tight ends out there” Ferentz said. “My argument is that the offense never changes just the people who are in there.”But the Patriots haven’t been satisfied with most of their other options waiving tight ends Will Yeatman and Dan Gronkowski and offensive tackle Thomas Welch who lined up as an eligible receiver at times. Those duties have been handed to the rookie offensive tackle Nate Solder who started at tight end for two seasons with the University of Colorado.“I’ve been flexible” said Solder who is primarily a blocker when he serves as the third tight end. “I’ve been playing all sorts of different positions and I just go in wherever they need me.”He may have to go in often Sunday although Hernandez doesn’t seem too worried about Gronkowski who has not practiced this week after leading the N.F.L. with 17 receiving touchdowns.“Everybody needs to step up if Rob isn’t 100 percent because he draws so much attention and is such a threat on the field” Hernandez said. “I think he’ll play. I think he’ll be a big impact in this game.”And on the other sideline? The Giants have kept three tight ends — Jake Ballard Bear Pascoe and Travis Beckum — on their active roster all season despite relying on their wide receivers for the downfield passing game.
 9,FLYING solo or in collaboration with other New Vaudevillians like Michael Moschen (in ''Foolsfire'' and ''The Alchemedians'') Bob Berky has proven himself to be an inspired clown. As a performance artist he evidently has a desire to expand his range into writing and directing. One result of this ambition is ''Traveling'' an evening of sketches at the Actors Outlet Theater. The show was conceived and directed by Mr. Berky and written by him in collaboration with the National Theater of Woodbee. While awarding Mr. Berky points for earnestness in pursuit of laughter one must also acknowledge that ''Traveling'' at least in part is a jejune journey.The revue deals at length with such subjects as arrival and departure methods of transport and to too great an extent baggage. This means that the nine actors in the company -none of them in a comic class with Mr. Berky himself - rush back and forth across the stage pretending to be tourists in transit and vehicles in motion.By design the show has far more text than Mr. Berky's previous efforts - and the writing puts too much stress on repetition as in an argument over the relative weight of a single suitcase. Occasionally the evening diverges from the central issue as in a long somber folk story about coyotes a story that stops the comedy in its tracks.Visually there are a few amusing devices such as a swinging door that acts as a revolving billboard. Every time the door is opened we see a travel poster illustrating the attraction of a tourist site. The show begins to reveal hitherto hidden comic possibilities when the setting shifts to the Quick Transit travel agency whose manager naturally is named Gloria Mundi.
 9,The Brooklyn District Attorney's office announced yesterday that it was seeking to bring criminal charges against Nushawn J. Williams for any role he might have played in infecting girls or women in Brooklyn with the virus that causes AIDS. Investigators with the District Attorney's office have begun posting signs in Mr. Williams's old neighborhoods in an effort to get potential victims to come forward.Mr. Williams who turns 21 today has been accused by state health officials of having unprotected sex with dozens of girls here and in western New York State knowing all the while that he was carrying the potentially deadly virus. Officials believe that at least 10 people have been infected with H.I.V. through contact with Mr. Williams or one of his sexual partners and they say that number could grow substantially.''We are looking to build a criminal case against Nushawn Williams'' said Dennis Hawkins a deputy district attorney in Brooklyn. ''If victims make complaints we could pursue charges from reckless endangerment to assault to attempted murder.''The Bronx District Attorney's office is also investigating reports that Mr. Williams might have infected a high school student in that borough.

 0,Well at least one though there’s probably many more out there. Before today’s England-Portugal match I asked if we’d hear the word “Falklands” uttered if the English lost a game refereed by an Argentine. I think this qualifies as a winner. On Fox Soccer Channel’s “Ticket To Germany” tonight the second English fan interviewed in Germany explained the outcome this way: “Argentinian ref. — not that we want to go into politics and stuff but we’ve been cheated…. We were never going to win that we could still be playing now taking penalties and that referee wouldn’t have had it. Robbed cheated gutted. The Malvinas is ours and 1982 will be revisited tonight.”

 9,North Korea is again threatening to restart its weapons-oriented nuclear program if progress is not made in talks aimed at modernizing its nuclear reactors.In talks today in New York with officials from the United States South Korea Japan and other representatives of an international consortium North Korea demanded more than $500 million in extras including building roads housing and power lines in addition to the two $2 billion light-water reactors that the consortium has agreed to provide.We're trying to negotiate an agreement which defines the terms of supplying the light-water reactors and the scope of supply" said Stephen Bosworth executive director of the consortium the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization.In an apparent effort to step up the pressure on the United States and other consortium members to meet its demands a North Korean Foreign Ministry official said on Thursday "It is self-evident that we cannot continue to unilaterally fulfill our obligation -- a nuclear freeze -- if the U.S. side does not fulfill its obligation concerning the provision of light-water reactors."
 0,Steve Marcus/ReutersThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether trades in health care stocks by the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors as recently as last year were made using inside information a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.The investigation comes as SAC one of the most prominent hedge funds in the world with $12 billion in assets under management has become something of a focal point for authorities. Two former SAC portfolio managers have pleaded guilty to criminal charges of using inside information to trade technology stocks.And Senator Charles E. Grassley Republican of Iowa has questioned how the S.E.C. handled referrals from Wall Street’s self-regulator the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority regarding 20 stock trades by SAC.But the S.E.C.’s investigation into trading by SAC appears to be much broader. In addition to the inquiry into trading in health care stocks — trades that took place from at least 2007 through 2010 — the agency is examining SAC’s use of expert network firms companies that connect Wall Street investors with outside experts in various industries the person briefed on the matter said.Separately the S.E.C. is looking into whether the hedge fund used inside information about the 2007 takeover of MedImmune a biotechnology company the person said. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported about the inquiry into MedImmune.A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.Neither SAC nor its billionaire founder Steven A. Cohen has been accused of wrongdoing by the S.E.C. or by any other authority. A spokesman for SAC declined to comment on Thursday.The inquiries into the SAC trades are part of an accelerating effort by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan to crack down on insider trading with a particular focus on hedge funds. The criminal investigations by federal prosecutors have resulted in charges against 49 people 39 of whom have pleaded guilty.Two people who have pleaded guilty were the former SAC employees Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil. Mr. Freeman is expected to testify Thursday at the trial of Winifred Jiau a consultant for an expert network firm who is charged with leaking inside information. SAC has said that it is “outraged” by the conduct of the two former employees.The cases against Mr. Freeman and Mr. Longueuil are part of the government’s examination of expert network firms which developed over the last decade alongside the proliferation of hedge funds. The government has filed criminal charges against 13 people connected to the firms eight of whom have pleaded guilty.The former SAC employees admitted to obtaining inside information about public companies and then using it to make profitable trades. The charges against the men detailed a cover-up straight from a television drama that involved destroying a hard drive with pliers and spreading the parts throughout the city.Others with past ties to SAC have also been ensnared in the insider trading investigation. Earlier this year Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided two hedge funds founded by former SAC executives Level Global Investors and Diamondback Capital Management. In 2009 Richard Choo-Beng Lee pleaded guilty to insider trading related to activity after he left SAC.The S.E.C. has faced criticism that it failed to bring significant cases against prominent hedge funds as well as cases stemming from the financial crisis.In April Senator Grassley asked the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in a letter to provide information on the “potential scope of suspicious trading activity” at SAC.Last month he followed up with a letter to the S.E.C. requesting to know how it handled past referrals about SAC’s trading activity.MedImmune is not among those trades referred by Finra according to people briefed on the matter.SAC executives including Peter Nussbaum the firm’s general counsel and its outside lawyers met with staff members in Mr. Grassley’s office to discuss his inquiry.Additionally federal prosecutors are examining trades in an account overseen by Mr. Cohen.Court filings related to the cases of the two former SAC portfolio managers who have pleaded guilty to insider trading indicate that the government is reviewing trades made in Mr. Cohen’s account at the suggestion of the former employees.

 9,Ruling in a major school desegregation case the Supreme Court today gave hundreds of formerly segregated school districts a potential new legal tool for returning to local control after decades of operating under Federal court supervision.The 8-to-0 ruling in a case from De Kalb County Ga. in Atlanta's suburbs allows school districts to win release from court control bit by bit as they achieve racial equality in various facets of their operations. It overturned a Federal appeals court ruling that required school districts to achieve equality in seven aspects of their operations before they could win release from judicial supervision of any. Important QualificationsBut if the decision provided a road map for the return to local control it left significant obstacles in the school districts' path. As a result the practical impact of the ruling is less clear than its significance as legal doctrine. [ Excerpts from the opinions page B8. ]Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's majority opinion contained important qualifications suggesting that even a school district that has erased the vestiges of segregation in its assignment of students to particular schools might have to remain under court supervision because of the "synergistic" relationship between various elements of a school system's operations.

 9,Over its 23-year history the Harlem Urban Development Corporation received almost $100 million in state funds to help rebuild Harlem. Millions of dollars were spent on lawyers hundreds of thousands went for telephone calls around the world and perks like cellular phones and cars and hundreds of thousands more are still unaccounted for.And when the agency was dissolved two years ago state officials say it had not produced a single major commercial project.Internal audits released yesterday by the Pataki administration portray an agency with few controls where state money sloshed freely with little regard for contracting procedures or documentation. One lawyer who had a contract for $28750 wound up being paid $171591. Some employees were classified as ''consultants'' by the corporation which failed to withhold as much as $1.5 million in state and Federal taxes from their paychecks.The revelations of the inner workings of the development corporation which for a generation was the prime hope for re-development in Harlem has prompted a criminal investigation an official in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said yesterday. The State Commission of Investigation is also examining the agency's activities.
 0,During a recent interview the German soprano Diana Damrau and the Italian tenor Vittorio Grigolo tried to describe the chemistry they have together onstage. Reading their comments I worried that they might be overthinking things. After all they first worked together only last year appearing as the lovers in Massenet’s “Manon” at the Metropolitan Opera. The couple thrilled audiences and critics with the smoldering intensity they emitted. So this is a new relationship. In talking about their instinctive connection might they risk making it self-conscious?Not to fear. On Saturday night for its New Year’s Eve gala the Met introduced a new production of Gounod’s “Roméo et Juliette” starring Mr. Grigolo and Ms. Damrau as Shakespeare’s star-crossed adolescent lovers. In scene after scene these exciting and charismatic artists disappeared into their characters emboldening each other to sing with white-hot sensuality and impassioned lyricism.The production by the director Bartlett Sher his seventh for the Met updates the setting from Renaissance to 18th-century Verona presenting an essentially traditional staging with some surreal touches that seem a little forced. Still to whatever degree Mr. Sher shaped the courageous performances of his stars and this very strong cast he deserves much credit.

 0,Attention theatrical birdwatchers. A couple of rare species will be on view this summer at the Stratford Festival in Canada. "The Lark" Jean Anouilh's rarely seen meditation on the life of Joan of Arc will land on the festival stage at the end of July. Starring in the production will be another elusive creature Amanda Plummer whose infrequent stage appearances are always worth noting. (Ms. Plummer was last seen in New York in Tracy Letts's "Killer Joe" back in 1998; she withdrew from his play "Bug" an Off Broadway hit from last year shortly before it opened.) Although Ms. Plummer will be making her Stratford Festival debut her arrival is a homecoming of sorts. Now the whole family will have played Stratford. Her parents -- Christopher Plummer and Tammy Grimes -- are both alums. Her father's triumphant performance in "King Lear" was a highlight of recent Stratford seasons and theater buffs may also recall that Mr. Plummer appeared in the original Broadway production of "The Lark" in 1955 playing the Earl of Warwick opposite Julie Harris's Joan of Arc. The Stratford production directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg will use the same Lillian Hellman adaptation but this time Joan's trial will unfold against the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. "The Lark" which runs from July 31 to Oct. 29 opens at the Festival Theater on Aug. 11. (800) 567 1600 www.stratfordfestival.ca CHARLES ISHERWOOD
 0,For William 20 a junior from Birmingham Ala. her awakening during this tournament has been a validation of her skill and a rebuke to the countless people who told her she was too short to play major college basketball. After averaging 9.6 points for her career William scored 41 in a regional final a week ago against Baylor. And then she dribbled three times to the right of the lane just before overtime expired on Friday and hit a 15-foot jumper sending Mississippi State’s players and fans into delirium.In that moment William did what every child who ever played basketball in the driveway or shot at a hoop nailed to a barn has dreamed of and rehearsed — counting the time down hitting the winning shot and hearing the crowd erupt with the sound of something decisive and astounding.“Sometimes all it takes is one kid to go into a completely different zone and they can carry a team through an entire tournament” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “It happens. That kid averaged 9 points a game during the season. This isn’t the regular season. She doesn’t have to do it for the next five months.” Just for one more night.“That’s a whole different dynamic” he said.Auriemma met William at a Final Four banquet on Wednesday night and said he told her: “That’s what the N.C.A.A. tournament’s all about for kids to throw themselves into the national spotlight. It’s the chance of a lifetime and you’re taking advantage of it.”But her career has not followed the same smooth arc as her winning shot on Friday.When William was a senior in high school in Birmingham in 2014 her stepfather Donnie Rory died of a heart attack. He had played football at Samford University in Alabama and had encouraged his stepdaughter to play basketball. She could play in the S.E.C. he told her and could be the best point guard in the conference. “Every time I play basketball I think about him” William said. “He put the ball in my hand when I was 3 and I ran from there.”At Mississippi State she found the understanding of Schaefer who had lost both his parents. William rooms with Schaefer’s daughter Blair a reserve guard on the team and often eats dinner at the Schaefer household.
 9,Thailand's decision to send volunteer ground forces as well as gunboats and other military aid to Pnom penh may in the short run bolster the shaky Lon Nol regime and help to speed the promised withdrawal of American forces from Cambodia this month. In the long run however this latest extension of the Indo china conflict is more likely to add to the problems of the Cambodians—and the Thais—and to complicate the task of extricating American forces from South east Asia.The Thai move is almost certain to provoke a reac tion from Communist forces already operating inside Thailand and along the long porous Thai border with Laos. It could in time lead to a more substantial extension of the Indochina war to Thailand itself.For the Cambodians this fresh promise of “help” from another traditional foe is at best a doubtful blessing even though it is accompanied by assurances that the helpers will all be Thais of Cambodian descent. The Thai move means a further intensification of the fighting on Cambodian soil with all the destruction and loss of civilian life that entails. It will add weight to the nationalist appeal of ousted Prince Sihanouk who has alrerady gained recruits for his Communist backed fight to regain power as a result of South Vietnam's heavy‐handed intervention on behalf of the Lon Nol Government.It could even lead to the dismemberment of Cam bodia with the Thais indefinitely occupying western areas of the country some of which they have long claimed; with the South Vietnamese taking over effec tive control in the southeastern region where their forces are operating and with Communist forces hold ing firm in the northeast where they are entrenched.
 0,The challenge put to The Times's critics was direct: Name a 20th-century work considered ''timeless'' today that you think will be all but forgotten in 100 years. Their selections:'THE NUTCRACKER' A TIRED GIMMICKVisions of sugarplum fairies will continue to dance in our heads through Tchaikovsky's glorious score for ''The Nutcracker.'' The music will endure but as a ballet ''The Nutcracker'' is approaching self-destruction.Although the first staging dates from 1892 the ''Nutcracker'' craze began with George Balanchine's 1954 production for the New York City Ballet. A shrewd mix of spectacle and romantic plot (a child's dream journey into a candy kingdom) has been turned by dance troupes throughout the land into a box-office gimmick.The truth is that ''The Nutcracker'' slim on classical dancing is not the ideal introduction to ballet. Hence the urge to tinker and the spate of revisionist versions: Drosselmeier the little heroine's godfather is now likely to be a child molester. At some point we will prefer an ice show from that other magic kingdom. ANNA KISSELGOFF

 0,As protesters rally around the country in support of citizenship for undocumented workers a different group of immigrants and their descendents sat quietly at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington. Rudolph W. Giuliani the former New York mayor seeking the G.O.P. presidential nomination walked a careful line while addressing immigration before the Latino Coalition’s Small Business Economic Conference.He called for a database to identify all immigrants a border fence a better system of law enforcement and “laws that make sense.”“If you have 12 million people to 13 to 14 to 15 million that are here illegally it is much easier for terrorists and drug dealers to hide” he said. “It’s like a needle in a haystack.”He proposed that undocumented workers could “come forward if they’re working and they’re compliant with the law and they’re making a contribution then let’s sign ‘em up let’s register them let’s collect their taxes and let’s make them pay their fair share.”Mr. Giuliani said illegal immigrants should ultimately be eligible for citizenship.“We need a sensible solution to this not a one issue solution” he said in an apparent critique of the enforcement-only approach popular with a major segment of his party which is divided on the issue. “If we do a one-issue solution we’re going to be in much greater danger.”In drawing a distinction between illegal immigrants here in the country to work and those here to make trouble he cited his mayoral experience in New York where he asked the Immigration and Naturalization Service to focus on deporting drug dealers rather than a professor who overstayed his visa and a myriad of other illegal workers.“And I would say oh ok all right this is maybe good maybe bad you can have a big debate about all this is this good for our economy? I think it is some people think it isn’t that’s is a nice debate we can have. You’ve got drug dealers pal” he said to laughter. “They’re no good for anybody.”According to Robert G. de Posada president of the Latino Commission Mr. Giuliani “hit the right tones.”“He was able to deliver what Bush delivered over Kerry in 2004” Mr. Posada added “which was ‘I know this community.’ ”Nonetheless he said endorsement discussions among the board of the Latino Commission which is ideologically to the right of the major national Hispanic groups “is very open.”He said that tough immigration talk is “absolutely” driving away Latinos who might otherwise vote Republican as is a perception that the party is becoming “just another big government big brother operation.” He added that a new trend in ticket-splitting is emerging among Hispanics.Lucia Leonard a member of the Latino Coalition who runs an international business development firm identifies as a Republican and said she is more concerned about economic and trade issues than immigration. So far she’s leaning toward Mr. Giuliani but she questioned whether he planned to build the fence along the northern border or the southern border. “There are other ways he can accomplish the same goal” Ms. Leonard said.

 9,If nobody complained why the convulsion? Because those paying more than their share of costs were not prevented from finding alternatives. Lured by new technology the F.C.C. starting in the late 50's gradually let competitors skim the cream from Ma Bell's commercial and long-distance services - the very ones that were subsidizing local rates. And when the ensuing antitrust actions led to a divorce of A.T. & T.'s long- and short-distance systems the F.C.C. had to find a way to replace the subsidies from long to short.Though every phone is billed locally most will still be served by several companies: Ma Bell's regional offspring and long-distance connectors like A.T. & T. and its competitors. The economically pure remedy would be to charge every phone line $7 more a month the amount of the old system's subsidy to local service. But that would ignite a rebellion against any change.So the F.C.C. decided to shift the burden gradually to charge business phones more than residential and to justify the higher charge by calling it a fee for ''access'' to the interstate system. This rationalization has gone down poorly with consumers trained to restrain their long-distance calls. And it has complicated the job of state regulators who may have to let local phone rates double in a decade. There are fears the increases will drive poorer families off the phone grid destroying the universal service that benefits everyone. Congress already feels pressure to preserve the subsidies from long-distance to short. What's wrong with that? The short answer is efficiency. Technology promises many new conveniences and savings through long-distance communication; society will reap the benefits only if costs are properly allocated. A further answer is that innovations like cable and satellites will make it easier for high-volume business communicators to bypass the phone network altogether; stick them with the subsidy and they'll soon be unreachable. The best answer is that a carefully planned reform need not threaten universal service while accurate pricing could produce billions in new benefits. The number of people who would drop phone service priced at full cost is probably very small; a tripling of rates tomorrow would leave the average family paying no more of its income for basic service than in 1950. And if Congress wants to protect the very poor the least distorting way is to subsidize their phones directly. Or state regulators could freeze the cost of a no-frills service for the poor. But the truer the price for everyone else the broader the social gain. Underpricing local calls may enrich a shut-in's communication with neighbors but it severely limits communication with grandchildren or friends far away. And artificially high long-distance prices raise the price of everything else: business calls that might cost $2 end up in a letter that costs $3.50 to type. Small change perhaps until it dawns that Americans make 300 billion telephone calls a year. Will price reform improve service? Not if rate increases are beaten down politically and local phone companies are left starving. But a gradual approach to real costs can yield ever more efficiencies. Much depends on the political skill and courage of regulators and the understanding of the public.

 9,Robert Rauschenberg's "Rebus" from 1955 -- auctioned 18 months ago for a record $6.3 million -- was sold last night at Sothebys's in Manhattan for $7.3 million. The price was the highest paid at auction for a work by the artist and at Sotheby's current sale of postwar art.Rauschenberg's curiously serene "Rebus" a huge 8-by-11-foot work splashed with paint plaster varnish graffiti a torn poster comics and photographs was added to Sotheby's sale after the catalogue went to press in early March. The owner Hans Thulin a Swedish real-estate investor was ordered to sell "Rebus" by the Swedish finance company Nyckeln to whom he had given the work as collateral on a loan.Bidding for "Rebus" was intense between at least three potential buyers -- two in the room and one who bid by telephone from an undisclosed location. Sotheby's did not identify the buyer. Contacted after the sale by telephone the Manhattan art dealer Larry Gagosian was asked whether the buyer of "Rebus" was Charles Saatchi the British advertising magnate for whom Mr. Gagosian acts as agent. "No I bought 'Rebus' " Mr. Gagosian said. "I think it is an incredible painting."Asked if he had a client for the Rauschenberg Mr. Gagosian replied "We'll see." Americans Dominate Bidding

 0,HBO HBO The number of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender characters has grown in recent years on prime-time network television but decreased on cable the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said. For its recently published “Where We Are On TV” study the alliance reviewed 79 scripted comedies and dramas announced to air on the broadcast networks during the 2009-2010 season and found that of 600 series regulars on these shows 18 are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender. The study said that ABC has the most such characters with 8 out of 168 total series regulars; Fox has four (including cartoon characters from “The Simpsons” and “American Dad”) NBC has three CW has two and CBS has none. In its review of mainstream cable channels including HBO Showtime Comedy Central AMC and others the alliance found that the number of series regulars who are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender decreased this year to 25 from 32 last year. When the gay-oriented cable channels here! and Logo were accounted for the study said an additional 27 such characters were added to the tally.

 0,Peter Blum99 Wooster Street SoHoThrough Dec. 28The quilts that represented Rosie Lee Tompkins in the Whitney Biennial last spring did not do her work full justice. But its greatness shines forth undiluted in her New York gallery debut which shows 11 quilts dating from 1986 to 2002. Unerring and intuitive in their sense of color shape and scale Ms. Tompkins's quilts are formidably joyful visual events that ignore the usual boundaries between cultures histories and mediums.They belong to the history of European modernism and African-American quilting 20th-century textiles and 20th-century painting. They connect to African textiles especially the bark cloth paintings of the Kuba and the Ituri of Central Africa and also to music. Their improvisational finesse has been rightly compared to jazz but Bach's spiritual architectonics are also pertinent.Their animated compositions have been likened to the paintings of Hans Hofmann Alfred Jensen and Howard Hodgkin; but Josef Albers Stuart Davis Klee and late Mondrian also come to mind. So do the trippy mutating arrangements of computer artists like John R. Simon the textiles of Anni Albers and the little-known appliqué paintings of Eve Peri.Ms. Tompkins was born in 1936 lives in the Bay Area and uses a pseudonym to protect her privacy. She learned her craft as a child in eastern Arkansas helping her mother piece quilts and says that God guides her work. Although known to specialists in African and African-American art since the early 1990's her achievement was brought to wider art world attention by Lawrence Rinder who organized a show of her work at the art museum at the University of California at Berkeley in 1997 and then put it in the 2002 Whitney Biennial.

 0,The caricatures flourish. People who can’t agree on anything political find common ground on one point: undecided voters are vapid disengaged and a little bit frightening.And yet there they are still part of the electorate. Over the past few weeks I have been using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project to explore the thoughts and feelings of voters who were undecided last December. The takeaway has been that they are typically less interested in politics; they pay less attention to news in general; and they are more likely to have moderate ideas on contemporary political questions (but 30 percent report that they have no political ideas at all). So far the caricature pretty much holds.They are also more likely to be women (63 percent) more likely to have less than a high school education; less likely to hold a graduate degree; and more likely to have family incomes of less than $30000 a year.The data however also reveal that almost half of the undecided consider themselves Democrats or Republicans. But even this cue is not as strong for them – only 65 percent eventually choose their party’s candidate (as opposed to 95 percent of early-deciding partisans).It is possible that political signals like party mean less to late-deciders because politics is like a foreign country to them. But another possibility is that some of their ideas conflict with the positions their putative party takes.Here’s an example. On the question of whether to raise taxes on families earning more than $200000 a year most Democrats say yes – roughly 80 percent of early-deciding and undecided voters favor this policy. But among Republicans 60 percent of early deciders oppose this policy while only a quarter of undecided voters oppose it. Even at the highest levels of income (more than $100000 a year) the difference among Republican early and late deciders on this issue is more than 30 points.Similar differences can be found on whether undocumented immigrants who have been living in the United States should have a legal path to citizenship. Compared to early-deciding Democrats undecided Democrats are more than 30 points less likely to favor the pathway; undecided Republicans are 20 points less likely to oppose it compared to their co-partisans.But these out-of-step late-deciding semi-partisans do not always abandon their party at the ballot box. Conflicted undecided Democrats are more likely (75 percent to 25) to break for Romney over Obama if they oppose raising taxes on the rich but no more likely to break for Romney if they oppose the pathway to citizenship. The reverse is true for conflicted undecided Republicans – more likely to choose Obama if they disagree with Republicans on immigration but no more likely to choose Obama if they disagree with Romney on taxing the rich.Looked at in this light the undecided actually exemplify a type of political flexibility we often claim to admire but often denigrate in practice. A healthy portion of undecided voters seem to understand when they are out of step with their party and this sometimes drives them to the opposing candidate. They may not be as interested in news or politics as you are but they consider their preferences relative to party positions when making up their minds. Adjust those caricatures.Let’s briefly move away from party to another canonical driver of voter choice in American elections: attitudes about race. Despite the subject’s prevalence in 2008 when the economic collapse portended a strong Democratic victory the discussion of race has been conspicuously absent in 2012 or at least much less of a focus. The problem with this is that the 2012 election is going to be much closer. Attitudes about race could be pivotal in a way they almost surely could not have been in 2008 when we couldn’t stop talking about it.I’ve modeled votes for Obama or Romney separately for early deciders and initially undecided voters using only party identification ideology retrospective evaluations of the nation’s economy and a measure called racial resentment.Racial resentment is one of a set of regularly used political science measures of attitudes about race. It is born from the concept of symbolic racism which has its share of critics. Essentially it is a scale of four survey questions asking people to agree or disagree with questions about whether “generations of slavery” have made it hard for blacks to work their way up the economic ladder – or whether blacks would be as well off as whites if they only “tried harder.”Racial resentment is related to voter choice for every presidential election in modern history. Interestingly even within the 2008 Democratic primary these attitudes robustly predicted a voter’s choice between Obama and Hillary Clinton. Evidence from 2008 also suggests that racial resentment plays a larger role when Obama is running relative to others who have run for president before.Here is what the relationship looks like in 2012 plotting across deciles of resentment in the overall sample. After controlling for party ideology and economic judgments increasing levels of racial resentment (moving from left to right on the horizontal axis) decrease the likelihood of voting for Obama – not a shock. But here’s where it gets interesting. For voters who were able to make up their minds early moving from the lowest levels of resentment to the highest drops the chance of their voting for Obama by more than 70 points. The comparable drop among initially undecided voters is only slightly more than 10 points.PhotoAs we saw with party attitudes about race among the undecided are related to their choices but the relationship is weaker than it is for those who decide early. In other words the racial attitudes of undecided voters do not affect their vote for or against Obama as dramatically as those same attitudes affect otherwise-similar early deciders.On the one hand this could be interpreted as more good news — another blow at the caricature. Perhaps undecided voters are truly post-racial. If race mattered to them as much as it does early deciders they’d have already made up their minds as the more partisan do. Maybe these voters are the ones who have moved “beyond” race at least in terms of their candidate selection.On the other hand I’m already catching sight of Seth Meyers over at “Saturday Night Live “ working on the next skit about undecided voters with the too-good-to-pass-up punch line: “Wait what do you mean the president’s black?”Lynn Vavreck is an associate professor of political science and communication studies at U.C.L.A. She is a co-author with John Sides of “The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election” the author of “The Message Matters: The Economy and Presidential Campaigns” and co-principal investigator of the 2012 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project.

 9,The Senate has approved a $252 billion military spending bill that includes an amendment barring the Pentagon from conducting training missions with foreign soldiers who have committed human rights abuses.The United States military conducted training exercises with 102 foreign armies last year according to Pentagon records. Some of those armies -- for example the Indonesian military -- have a record of abusing their own citizens.The amendment proposed by Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont would bar the Pentagon from holding joint exercises with human rights abusers unless the Secretary of Defense finds an extraordinary need to waive the law. The Pentagon did not oppose the measure.The spending bill passed by a 97-to-2 vote late Thursday includes $1.9 billion for the open-ended United States military mission in Bosnia. The House version of the military spending bill provides no money for military operations in Bosnia.

 9,TWO hotels are already operating adjacent to the PNC Bank site and three more are nearing completion nearby part of an 80-acre site dubbed Airport Interplex. Extended Stay America is adding 140 rooms and will be joined by a 140-room Hampton Inn and a Studio Plus property with 85 rooms said Jerry Segal senior vice president of Korman Commercial Properties Inc. Other off-airport lodging includes Embassy Suites Marriott Westin and Days Inn.''These are replacing lots of rooms that were very old said Mr. Segal. ''They can support the convention center because they're so close to downtown with the Eastwick rail station.''Michael G. French a principal with Coopers & Lybrand LLP in Philadelphia said aging hotels near the airport and the nearby sports complex have been renovated thanks to capital programs by hotel chains like Promus Corp. and HFS which recently purchased properties or chains that own hotels there.''The airport market in Philadelphia even in the worst of times always operated at healthier occupancy levels than Center City or other surrounding markets largely because for a long time it was under-supplied compared to other airport markets'' said Mr. French.''In 1991-92 the hotels were being operated by asset managers on behalf of banks or going through restructurings but even then the airport markets did well. The average occupancy is close to 80 percent and for that market it's at capacity because things are always soft on Sunday nights. Commercial travelers are increasingly inclined to come in have a meeting and get out.''In 1996 the Airport Council International reported Philadelphia had 1.6 million inbound and outbound international travelers a 27 percent gain over the year before. And US Airways the dominant airline serving Philadelphia intends to improve both its service and facilities here. Nevertheless many Philadelphia-area travelers depart from Newark or New York airports because of a limited number of international departures.Construction is under way in two of the airport's five terminals to add moving sidewalks and a 45000-square-foot retail mall. In addition the airport has announced a $300 million expansion of its international terminal. And US Airways has disclosed plans for a new commuter-flight facility the addition of flights to Amsterdam and increased service to Frankfurt Rome London and Paris among other destinations.

 9,Asked about atrocities attributed to his forces Mr. Taylor said at a news conference today that the course of the war had been set by God."I just believe in the destiny of man being deemed by God and wars whether manmade or what are directed by a force" he said. "And so when I say it is God's war God has his own way of restoring the land and he will restore it after this war."After starting Liberia's civil war in December 1989 with an attack by two dozen fighters who penetrated the country from neighboring Ivory Coast Mr. Taylor messily succeeded in his initial goal of bringing down the dictator Samuel K. Doe a brutal unschooled army sergeant.But a West African peacekeeping force led by Nigeria prevented Mr. Taylor from taking Monrovia and in time the proliferation of other militias each more violent and undisciplined than the last forced Mr. Taylor to content himself with Gbarnga and kept him supplied with enemies. Before war tore the country into separate fiefs Liberians many of whom are the descendants of freed American slaves were relatively prosperous.Another factional leader Alhaji Kromah the leader of the Ulimo Militia which for much of the war was the principal rival of Mr. Taylor's forces arrived at Monrovia's airport today.Ismael Diallo one of the thousands of people who gathered early today to greet him said "I don't support any of these people I only support peace."As bands beat out rhythms on drums and crowds broke into traditional dances Mr. Diallo who said he had lost several family members to the conflict said what many Liberians have been thinking in recent days: "This country has been robbed of its life for six years. Our only hope is that we have come to our senses."
 9,The State Department report said Mr. bin Laden who has recently operated from bases in Afghanistan and is being sought in the United States on murder charges had ''global reach'' and offered ''logistical help to extremists not directly affiliated with his organization.''Department officials insisted that the decision not to designate Iran as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism was not meant as a gesture of good will toward Iran.Instead they said it reflected a reduction in terrorist attacks that could clearly be attributed to organizations supported by Iran. The report found that Iran apparently killed fewer Iranian dissidents abroad last year than in 1997.''There is a slight improvement in their record and we wanted to reflect that in our conclusions'' said a department official who insisted on anonymity. ''We just didn't feel the need to single them out in the way we have in the past. We obviously want to encourage better behavior.''Others in the Administration said the report had been worded in a fashion that they hoped would make clear to Iran the willingness of Washington to improve ties.''It would obviously be tough for us to go out there and brand Iran as the world's premier terrorist state while at the same time talking about our hope for better relations'' said an American official who insisted on anonymity. ''If the Iranians read this as a signal for better ties fine.''The report found that Iran ''continued to be involved in the planning and execution of terrorist acts'' and that it might have been responsible for the murders of five leading Iranian writers and political figures last year. The department also said Iran continued support a variety of terrorist groups in the Middle East including Hamas Hizballah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
 9,What? No Index?For all the Washington insiders who were hoping to find their names in the index and so turned gingerly to the back of "What It Takes: The Way to the White House" (Random House) Richard Ben Cramer's much publicized 1047-page look at the 1988 Presidential campaign and the reasons people run for President the author had a surprise: no index.The sputtering and the muttering could be heard in bookshops from Capitol Hill to Foggy Bottom to Georgetown. What do you mean no index? Surely there must be some breakdown of who did what to whom and on what page?"I insisted that there was going to be no index" Mr. Cramer said in a telephone interview. "For years I watched all these Washington jerks all these Capitol Hill executive-branch agency wise guys and reporters go into say Trover bookstore take a political book off the shelf look up their names glance at the page and put the book back. Washington reads by index and I wanted those people to read the damn thing."Mr. Cramer said that in fact one of his most searing impressions of Washington after "imbibing the subculture of the floating political crap game" while he researched the book was that in Washington "everyone will talk as if they have read a book but nobody will actually have read it."
 9,It was just one line in an otherwise unremarkable meeting on Monday but it surprised the officials in the room: Secretary of State Warren Christopher suggested that the West should begin to think about a Russia without Boris N. Yeltsin.Mr. Christopher's declaration came in response to a question by Italy's Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli who expressed concern about the Russian President's leadership. She bluntly asked Mr. Christopher whether the West should "go on supporting" him according to participants in the meeting."Perhaps the world should be looking for an alternative" a senior Italian official paraphrased Mr. Christopher as saying.Ms. Agnelli declined in an interview to characterize Mr. Christopher's thinking on the sensitive subject. But she said that the time has come to look beyond Mr. Yeltsin.

 0,I have this week's front pages arrayed on the desk around me. There's a picture of dead children lined up on a floor while a mother wails. There's a picture of a man on the beach holding his dead son's hand to his forehead. There are others each as wrenching as the last.Human beings have always told stories to explain deluges such as this. Most cultures have deep at their core a flood myth in which the great bulk of humanity is destroyed and a few are left to repopulate and repurify the human race. In most of these stories God is meting out retribution punishing those who have strayed from his path. The flood starts a new history which will be on a higher plane than the old.Nowadays we find these kinds of explanations repugnant. It is repugnant to imply that the people who suffer from natural disasters somehow deserve their fate. And yet for all the callousness of those tales they did at least put human beings at the center of history.In those old flood myths things happened because human beings behaved in certain ways; their morality was tied to their destiny. Stories of a wrathful God implied that at least there was an active God who had some plan for the human race. At the end of the tribulations there would be salvation.

 9,Mery Griffin confirmed yes terday that he is taking his late‐night talk show to Cali fornia.Reports that Mr. Griffin was planning to move to the West Coast have been widespread for several months. The TV host said he would leave for Holly wood tomorrow. The first pro gram there will be taped Sun day evening and will be aired on the Columbia Broadcasting System either the following Tuesday or Wednesday.“I'm delighted with the move” Mr. Griffin said. “Some thing had to be done. There are three late‐night talk shows in New York and the same guests bounce from one to an other. Hollywood will give us a lot of fresh faces.”Audience to Be SmallerMr. Griffin said his show would originate in Studio 43 in Television City which has about 200 fewer seats than the Cort Theater in which the New York show was taped but a much larger stage area.Mr. Griffin's move to the West Coast also paves the way for participation by Saul Ilson and Ernest Chambers who signed as creative consultants with Mr. Griffin last week but whose contract depended on West Coast origination.

 0,McNEAL--Philip Webster beloved husband father son and friend passed away on May 27 2014. Philip was born in St. Louis Missouri on December 6 1953. The only child of the late Senator Theodore McNeal and his wife Virgie Philip was named after American labor movement giants A. Philip Randolph and Milton Webster. The elder McNeal worked with both men to organize the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters the most prominent predominantly black labor union of its day. In 1976 Philip graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering from University of Missouri Rolla and began his career at Exxon Mobil as a project engineer. In 1984 Philip joined J.P. Morgan as an investment banker in the firm's Natural Resources and Power Group and later Managing Director and Senior Client Advisor. Philip met his true love Glenda Goodly and they married in 1989. They enjoyed a rare enviable partnership of equals who not only loved but also truly respected each other. They were blessed with two wonderful children - daughter Sydney and son Carter. Despite his demanding career Philip was active in his community serving as a longtime board chair of the Montclair Human Needs Food Pantry former trustee of Montclair Kimberley Academy and trustee of Newark Academy. But at the very center of his life was his devotion to Glenda Sydney and Carter. He cherished each of them and their time together as a family. Philip found absolute contentment immersed in a finite set of passions: St. Barths boating Long Beach Island and his circle of extended family and friends. They comprised an endless stream of precious memories punctuated by the unforgettable expression on Philip's face when Glenda surprised him with a 60th birthday party in January 2014. Soon after Philip was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Philip's battle to the end with this devastating disease was marked by the same integrity clarity and steadiness of spirit he embodied in his work and personal life. Philip passed away at home surrounded by those he loved most on the eve of his and Glenda's 25th wedding anniversary. Thoughtful and generous to his core Philip would want the battle against pancreatic cancer to continue in the form of funding research so that others might be spared what he endured. A fund has been established in his honor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He is survived by Glenda Sydney and Carter; his mother Virgie half-brother Theodore McNeal Jr. and an extended family that loved him dearly. Few are as stellar in life as they are claimed to be in memory; Philip McNeal was and he will remain so in our hearts forever. Memorial service will be held on Monday June 2nd at 6pm at the Morgan Library 235 Madison Avenue New York New York.

 0,Fifteen years ago the miners here tried to form a collective pooling their money and labor. They accumulated a cache of nearly 900 pounds of amber and planned to set up their own store. But bandits stole the whole load and the cooperative collapsed in bitterness.The question of who owns the earth that the miners work is vexing. Some land is held in common some is privately owned and land rights often set off fierce fights. Some of the miners are freelancers some have to rent their mines from land owners. The least fortunate live down in the mouths of the mines.It is not a long life. There are no mine-workers' unions here no safety standards no rules or regulations no hard hats or flashlights. There is only work.Genaro Bonifaz Diaz 40 has been down in the mines since he was a child. He has seen friends die quickly in tunnels crushed by mudslides and die slowly as their lungs collapsed from the fine dust that flies with every hammer blow. ''We suffer but we have to support our families'' he said from underground.''Thank God I haven't been trapped'' he said. ''But when it's raining the roof can cave in and two of my buddies have died'' in recent months. ''Many of us have gotten sick in the lungs. These candles the smoke is terrible for you. But we don't have anything else.''As he pounded and hacked at the black wall before him a boy of 14 José Florentine Hernández Sanchez stood watching picking up the technique. José has worked in the mines off and on since he was 10 to pay for clothes and school supplies.''It scared me the first time I entered'' he said ''because I thought something bad might happen.''

 0,Conservative commentators and die-hard Republicans often brush off denunciations of Donald Trump as an unprincipled hatemonger by saying: Yeah yeah that’s what Democrats wail about every Republican they’re trying to take down. Sing me a song I haven’t heard so many times before.Howard Wolfson would be outraged by that response if he didn’t recognize its aptness.“There’s enough truth to it to compel some self-reflection” Wolfson who was the communications director for Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid in 2008 told me this week.In fact he finds himself thinking about it a whole lot: how extreme the put-downs of political adversaries have become; how automatically combatants adopt postures of unalloyed outrage; what this means when they come upon a crossroads — and a candidate — of much greater graver danger.“I worked on the presidential campaign in 2004” he said referring to John Kerry’s contest against George W. Bush. He added that he was also “active in discussing” John McCain when he ran for the presidency in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.
 0,Getting a lot of vitamin A in your diet is tied to a lower risk for squamous cell carcinoma a common form of skin cancer a review of studies has found.Squamous cell carcinoma a slow-growing cancer usually found on sun-exposed areas is easy to treat if found early although in rare cases it can spread to other tissues.The researchers writing in JAMA Dermatology used detailed health and diet data from 123570 men and women participating in two long-term studies. They found 3978 cases of squamous cell cancer over more than 26 years of follow-up.After controlling for various health factors including age other skin cancers and the number of lifetime blistering sunburns they found that compared with the one-fifth of people with the lowest intake of vitamin A those in the highest one-fifth had a 17 percent reduced risk for squamous cell cancer.
 0,Las mujeres somos volubles. Debido a nuestro diseño evolutivo estamos hechas para ser sensibles a nuestro entorno tener empatía con las necesidades de nuestros hijos e intuir las intenciones de nuestras parejas. Esto es esencial para nuestra supervivencia y la de nuestros descendientes. Algunas investigaciones sugieren que las mujeres tienen mayor capacidad para articular sentimientos que los hombres porque a medida que el cerebro femenino se desarrolla se reserva más capacidad para el lenguaje la memoria la audición y la observación de emociones de los demás.Estas observaciones se basan en la biología y no intentan aludir a ningún tipo de ideología pro- o antifeminista pero sí tienen consecuencias sociales. La emotividad de las mujeres es un signo de salud no de enfermedad; es una fuente de poder. Estamos sometidas a una presión constante por contener nuestras vidas emocionales; nos han enseñado a disculparnos por nuestras lágrimas a suprimir nuestro enojo y a temer que nos llamen histéricas.La industria farmacéutica usa ese miedo y se dirige a las mujeres mediante un torrente de publicidad en los programas de entrevistas matutinos y en las revistas. El número de estadounidenses que toma medicamentos nunca había sido tan alto y en mi experiencia los siguen tomando por mucho más tiempo del requerido. La venta de antidepresivos y ansiolíticos se ha disparado durante las últimas dos décadas y en épocas recientes han sido superadas por un antipsicótico Abilify que ocupa el primer lugar de ventas de entre todos los medicamentos que se comercializan en Estados Unidos no sólo los psiquiátricos.Como psiquiatra con veinte años de experiencia debo decir que esto es una locura.Al menos una de cada cuatro mujeres en Estados Unidos toma un medicamento psiquiátrico hoy en día en comparación con uno de cada siete hombres; y las mujeres son dos veces más proclives a que se les diagnostique depresión o trastorno de ansiedad que los hombres. Estos medicamentos han mejorado considerablemente la vida de muchas mujeres pero hay otras que no los necesitan. La mayor prescripción de medicamentos psiquiátricos que a menudo recetan médicos de otras especialidades está creando una nueva norma que alienta a más mujeres a recurrir al uso de químicos. La decisión de si una mujer necesita tomar estos medicamentos debería ser médica no una respuesta a la presión de grupo o al consumismo.La nueva norma de prescripción médica contradice la biología dinámica de las mujeres cuya química cerebral y corporal está hecha para cambiar constantemente. Para explicarlo de manera simple pensemos en la serotonina como el químico cerebral que nos dice que “todo está bien”; si hay demasiada serotonina nada nos importa pero si los niveles de serotonina son muy bajos todo se vuelve un problema que es necesario resolver.En los días previos a la menstruación cuando incrementa la sensibilidad emocional las mujeres pueden sentirse más expuestas irritables o insatisfechas. Yo les digo a mis pacientes que los pensamientos y sentimientos que perciben durante esta fase son genuinos y que tal vez es mejor reevaluar aquello con lo que tienen que lidiar en el resto del mes cuando es más probable que sus niveles hormonales y de neurotransmisores estén programados para motivarlas a que se adapten a las demandas y necesidades de los demás.Los antidepresivos más comunes que también se usan como ansiolíticos son los inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de serotonina (I.S.R.S.) que mejoran la transmisión de serotonina. Estos inhibidores hacen que las cosas “estén bien” pero no está bien ver todo bien. Un mayor nivel de serotonina puede hacer que una sea más tolerante y aquiete sus miedos pero también ayuda a que se vuelva insensible física y emocionalmente. Estos medicamentos a menudo hacen que las mujeres estén menos interesadas en el sexo. Los I.S.R.S. tienden más a suprimir los pensamientos negativos que a alentar los positivos. Si una está tomando un inhibidor selectivo de la recaptación de serotonina tal vez no ande por ahí brincando de alegría pero sí sentirá que es más racional y menos emocional. Algunas personas que utilizan estos medicamentos han dicho percibir menos otros rasgos humanos como la empatía la molestia la tristeza los sueños eróticos la creatividad el enojo la capacidad de expresar los sentimientos el duelo y la preocupación.Por supuesto que hay situaciones en las que es necesario el uso de medicamentos psiquiátricos. El problema es que mientras que hay demasiadas personas realmente enfermas que no están en tratamiento principalmente debido a factores socioeconómicos las personas que no necesitan estos medicamentos están tratando de suprimir una reacción normal a un conjunto de factores estresantes que no es natural: vidas sin suficientes horas de descanso sol nutrientes movimiento y contacto visual que son elementales para los primates sociales como nosotros.Si los niveles de serotonina de las mujeres se incrementan continuamente de manera artificial éstas corren el riesgo de perder sensibilidad emocional con sus fluctuaciones naturales al adoptar un equilibrio hormonal más masculino y estático. Esta insensibilización emocional alienta a las mujeres a asumir comportamientos que los hombres comúnmente aprueban: una apariencia invulnerable por ejemplo es una actitud que podría ayudar a las mujeres a escalar en negocios dominados por los hombres. Los estudios en primates muestran que los I.S.R.S. pueden aumentar comportamientos de dominio social y elevar el nivel de jerarquía de un animal.¿Pero a qué costo? Tuve una paciente que me llamó desde su oficina llorando para decirme que necesitaba aumentar su dosis de antidepresivos porque no podía permitir que la vieran llorando en el trabajo. Al descubrir el motivo de su molestia – su jefe la había humillado frente a sus subalternos – decidimos que lo que necesitaba era enfrentar a su jefe en una discusión calmada en lugar de más medicamentos.Una revisión de los historiales médicos muestra de manera constante que los doctores tienden a recetar medicamentos psiquiátricos a las mujeres más que a los hombres en especial a las mujeres de 35 a 64 años. Para algunas mujeres de esas edades los síntomas de la perimenopausia pueden ser muy parecidos a la depresión y es común sentir ganas de llorar. No sólo se llora de tristeza. Cuando estamos asustados o nos sentimos frustrados al presenciar una injusticia cuando nos conmueve profundamente la aflicción humana lloramos. Y algunas mujeres lloran más fácilmente que otras aunque eso no quiere decir que seamos débiles o que estemos fuera de control. Cuando se consumen dosis elevadas de I.S.R.S. se dificulta llorar; este medicamento incluso puede aumentar la apatía y la indiferencia. El cambio surge del descontento y la apreciación de que algo está mal; sabemos que algo está bien únicamente porque lo sentimos. Por lo tanto si estar medicado significa ser complaciente no sirve.Cuando una persona está consumiendo una mayor dosis de la necesaria sus emociones se vuelven sintéticas. Si lo que buscamos es crecimiento personal un matrimonio más satisfactorio y un mundo mucho más pacífico lo que necesitamos es más empatía compasión receptividad emotividad y vulnerabilidad no menos.Necesitamos dejar de etiquetar nuestra tristeza y ansiedad como síntomas incómodos y valorarlos como una parte saludable y flexible de nuestra biología.Sigue a NYT América en Facebook y Twitter para leer más noticias de The New York Times en español.

 0,To the Editor:What Paul Krugman says is true: the Social Security system is a pay-as-you-go system and therefore will never offer workers returns as good as they could get outside the system (column May 31). And George W. Bush's proposal is short on many salient details.But what Mr. Krugman misses is that the current system is fundamentally (and fatally) flawed in that citizens own nothing. Mr. Bush's plan is a politically palatable first step toward citizens' actually owning something and therefore controlling their own destinies rather than an all-powerful government's controlling everything. It truly represents a shifting of power to the people.DONALD C. GOECKSNew York May 31 2000
 0,Our turnout modelThere’s a big question on top of the standard margin of error in a poll: Who is going to vote? It’s a particularly challenging question this year since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.Our poll under different turnout scenarios Who will vote? Est. turnout Our poll result The types of people who voted in 2014 258k Barr +3 People whose voting history suggests they will vote regardless of what they say 273k Even Our estimate 275k Even People who say they will vote adjusted for past levels of truthfulness 291k Barr +2 The types of people who voted in 2016 305k Barr +4 People who say they are almost certain to vote and no one else 333k Barr +12 Every active registered voter 485k Barr +9In these scenarios higher turnout tends to be better for Republicans.Just because one candidate leads in all of these different turnout scenarios doesn’t mean much by itself. They don’t represent the full range of possible turnout scenarios let alone the full range of possible election results.

 0,Abbey BradenThe typical weekend music festival especially for those long of tooth and cranky of pants (say mid-30s or older) can be a Dante-like dystopia: interminable lines overzealous security unreasonably priced and inedible food watery beer claustrophobia-inducing space one-dimensional sounds and even port-a-potties (gasp!). This weekend however a far more user-friendly and multifaceted confab is thankfully smashing the hackneyed concert mold.All Tomorrow’s Parties (ATP) the independent British music festival makes its third annual appearance this weekend an hour and a half northwest of Manhattan at Kutsher’s the wondrous and dilapidated Borscht Belt resort (and putative inspiration behind the film “Dirty Dancing”). This year’s lineup includes Iggy Pop and the Stooges performing their third album “Raw Power” the hip-hop pioneer DJ Kool Herc and the reunited doom metal band Sleep. Ticket sales are capped at a comfortable 2000 and attendees have the run of the hotel’s relatively spacious grounds which by itself puts ATP head and shoulders above other similar fests — but that’s just the music half of it.How many rock festivals have a book club? Jim Jarmusch the film director and this year’s guest co-curator posted a reading list on the ATP Web site that includes “The Job: Interviews With William S. Burroughs” Luc Sante’s “Kill All Your Darlings” Nick Tosches’s “Years Before Elvis” and Samantha Hunt’s “The Invention of Everything Else.” Two of the authors Sante and Hunt will give readings and discuss their work with Paper Magazine’s Carlo McCormick.Much in the same way Jarmusch himself will be interviewed by Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore (the James Lipton of noise rock) on Saturday night on the topic of crime wave film. The director is presenting a series of felonious-filled black and white flicks like Kubrick’s “The Killing” von Sternberg’s “Underworld” and Aldrich’s “Kiss Me Deadly.” The movies are being shown in conjunction with the Criterion Collection the repackagers of classic and contemporary film who at each ATP host their own cinema.If excellent music literature and classic films inexplicably aren’t your bag ATP offers other visual stimuli: Tim Biskup and Eric White collaborate on paintings and prints based around a high-concept (and possibly imaginary) television program; Ricky Powell the photographer and Beastie Boy associate will present a slide show with images of hip-hop’s early years; and various comic illustrators are reimagining Criterion’s film selections as comic book covers.It’s rather ironic that members of Shellac one of alt rock’s most intense bands are acting as ATP’s quasi-recreational counselors. For the third straight year the producer and musician Steve Albini is hosting a card game out of one of the resort’s suites and the group’s bassist Bob Weston is organizing a pick-up baseball game. For a more cerebral respite music wonks can show how they’ve enriched/wasted their lives at a music trivia contest and at something called “Tom Waits Bingo.” While that may sound hilarious it’s probably not as funny as Todd Barry who headlines Friday night’s comedy stage along with Heather Lawless and Hannibal Buress.This year ATP wisely stole a page from the Brooklyn Flea recruiting the market’s lauded food vendors to hawk comestibles beyond the beer and dogs. Offerings include Asia Dogs (mango peanuts and cilantro wiener anyone?) Pizza Moto (with their own mobile brick oven) Chonchos Taco’s (known for its fish tacos) and perhaps most important of all Crop to Cup the perfect cure-all to a long weekend of intensive culture consumption.“ATP is like an excellent mix tape” says Barry Hogan who founded the festival a decade ago. “Each one is different and reflects a different person’s cultural interpretations and tastes — that’s the reason why it has been going so long.” And without a port-o-potty in sight.All Tomorrow’s Parties runs Sept. 3 to Sept. 5.

 0,The president of the carpenters' union Douglas J. McCarron President Bush's closest friend in organized labor has agreed to return more than $200000 in profits he made in a stock deal that is under federal investigation.On Tuesday Mr. McCarron informed the Union Labor Life Insurance Company a labor-owned carrier known as Ullico that he would pay back the money which he earned when he sold Ullico shares in what is being investigated for the possibility of insider trading.The Labor Department and a federal grand jury in Washington are investigating whether the deal in which Ullico repurchased shares from Mr. McCarron and several other union presidents on its board enabled them to enrich themselves improperly at the expense of the unions that own the insurer. Those unions include Mr. McCarron's the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.Subsequent Ullico proxy statements indicated that the board members profited by more than $6 million all told with Mr. McCarron earning $276000. In his letter this week to Ullico's chairman Robert A. Georgine he said he would return his profits minus taxes owed. His decision was first reported on Wednesday by the Bureau of National Affairs a publisher of legal and regulatory news.
 9,Although the European Community has acted to ban imports of beef from cattle treated with growth-stimulating hormones most experts in the United States insist that when the hormones are properly applied the beef is safe to eat.These experts say such small amounts of hormones remain in the beef that they would have no effect on human health.But some consumer advocates say the hormones are not always properly used. They tell of an investigation by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1986 indicating that some feed lot operators gave animals too much hormone or implanted it in the animals' bodies where it did not belong.The Agriculture Department says that it has stepped up enforcement since then and that misuse of hormones is now rare. But the consumer advocates are advising shoppers to look for beef from cattle not treated with the hormones. Hormone-Free Products
 9,At least three major United States carriers - Pan American World Airways Trans World Airlines and Northwest Orient Airlines - have continued to offer discounts on flights to England even though the British Civil Aviation Authority ordered the discounts stopped last Thursday.This is the second time the overseas airlines have defied the British agency. In October 1984 the agency had ruled that super-saver fares put in the month before were to be rescinded. All the carriers continued to offer the fares however until mid-December when the authority threatened to fine carriers for every passenger found traveling on the disapproved fares.The lag between the disapproval and the threat of any concrete action in that past incident may be encouraging airlines to sell past the current deadline analysts said. First MoveThe airlines also seemed to be waiting for the others to make the first move to stop offering the discounts.

They’re nudged along by culture that stimulates and expresses that demand.When corn was plentiful in Appalachia at the start of the 20th century the nation dutifully sopped up the surplus in corn whiskey. In the last two decades a second corn surplus stoked the obesity epidemic as Americans guzzled corn syrup by the silo.Obesity culture abounds today in the form of cup-holders and giant tableware. But its influence can also be found in the pushback against it: foodie-ism and pro-anorexia artifacts (including “thinspiration” videos and fashion photography) which play a significant role in refining sanctifying and curbing demand for food.Overproduction is not just an agricultural phenomenon. Consumer goods too can end up in surplus. It may be hard to imagine that man in his natural state does not crave millions of units of Bounty ExtraSoft paper towels or Dove Ultimate Cool Essentials Anti-perspirant Deodorant but it seems safe to say that the profusion of this stuff may sometimes eclipse our need for it.Who will relieve the groaning supermarket shelves? That’s where culture comes in. Specifically what’s in play are the cultures of couponing hoarding and stockpiling — the latest practices to obsess TV and the Web.For a glimpse of the drama check out the excerpt below of TLC’s “Extreme Couponing” a deceptively simple look at the complex drama of American spending and the paradoxes of parsimony.Retailers have of course long used coupons to shed extra inventory. But changes in the global supply chain have also conspired to simultaneously amp up supply. In 2010 the United States imported about $1 billion worth of “toiletries and cosmetics” from China where production costs are low. But the price of those items at the cash register even without coupons is deceptive according to Susan Helper the chair of the economics department at Case Western Reserve because costs to the environment are not cranked in. Environmental costs are especially substantial if you count not just carbon emissions but the building heating and cooling of storage facilities private houses roads and cars to accommodate the personal “stockpiles” of sundries on display in shows like “Extreme Couponing.” By ignoring these costs Helper told me “firms charge too little for their products causing people to buy too many of them.” So they make more.TLC is a television network that tirelessly shores up the current American middle class with shows about big families cupcakes Sarah Palin and outfits that flatter plus-size figures. TLC also runs an especially macabre program about hoarders called “Hoarding: Buried Alive.”When faced with a corn surplus we stuff it into our bodies for safekeeping. When faced with a stuff surplus we cram in into our houses.And what better place for useless dry goods than our houses? Americans now inhabit after all oversized dwellings with unfinished basements and extra rooms staple-gunned into existence during the housing boom. These spaces are perfect for what couponers proudly call “stockpiles.” That great bear-market term is used in this case by shoppers who claim to be saving their outlandishly sized supermarket hauls for rainy days the apocalypse or friends in need.Couponers acquire stuff in such obscene quantities because their coupons gleaned from newspaper inserts and online reward buying in quantity. (They also reward buying newspapers and “Extreme Couponing” doubles as an ad for subscribing promiscuously to print papers.)What’s more the presence of generous supermarket aisles doublewide shopping carts and patient and supportive checkout clerks all conspire to encourage the acquisition of dozens of every kind of grocery geegaw including mustard conditioner and salad-dressing packets.Unlike hoarders who are typically ashamed of their houses extreme couponers venerate their stockpiles. Where a hoard is disgusting and proof of pathology a stockpile is as orderly as a grocery store and proof of sound home economics. Extreme couponers install pegboards and shelves that revolve expiring cans and even invite friends to “shop” from their stockpiles. Some couponers also give canned goods to food banks and toothbrushes to the military.Astute online commentary about “Extreme Couponing” followed a recent review on EW.com. Debate crackled over about whether couponing is indeed thrifty with some arguing that it’s fun and enriching and others arguing that its yields don’t cover the couponers’ investment in space print newspapers gear and time. (Many also wondered about the real difference between a virtuous stockpile and a hideous hoard with a commenter named Cindy C proposing that TLC rename the show “Extremely Hoarding Coupons.”)With John Williams-style music the show derives suspense from the much-hyped “checkouts” during which we’re given to believe a couponer might have miscalculated and end up on the hook for more money than she has. Worse still the register might jam.The extreme couponers who almost never fail to bring their checkout totals down from four figures to one or two tend to see themselves as crusaders. Some believe they are out to defeat unjust retailers. Many believe they are saving their families from ruin. Still others believe they are on a God-given mission to teach thrift.With their stockpiles reminiscent of bomb shelters couponers often imagine they’re part of a war effort. And perhaps they are. There are far too many cheap consumer goods in circulation. Someone needs to take them off the market and pay to warehouse and even distribute them as the government once did with cheese and butter.Extreme couponers and even hoarders may be doing their patriotic part by filling their houses with manufacturing surplus. That may be necessary for the economy. But what does it cost them?
 9,ACCRA Ghana April 30 —The Government of President Kwame Nkrumah has abandoned its barrage of anti‐American propaganda which led to a serious strain in relations with Washington.For more than three weeks there has been a notable absence of the attacks in the Government‐controlled radio and press.Editorial assaults and Government‐sponsored demonstrations reached a peak in January and early February with the expulsion on charges of subversion of four Americans who were visiting professors at the University of Ghana.The State Department strongly protested and recalled Ambassador William P. Mahoney Jr. to Washington for “urgent consultations.”
 9,Cable operators balked at supporting the creation of ESPN in a market that already had Fox Sports West which carried Angels games and Fox Sports West 2 which telecast Mighty Ducks games. Once the ESPN West plan died Fox extended the Angels and Mighty Ducks' deals for an additional 10 years each.''Without ESPN West owning the teams just isn't worth it for Disney'' said John Moag managing director of the sports industry group at Legg Mason an investment bank based in Baltimore.It is possible that if Disney had successfully started ESPN West -- and figured it had reached its goal to improve the business climate for Disneyland in Anaheim by owning the Angels and the Mighty Ducks -- it might have sold the teams but kept their television rights.The allure of combining its teams with a cable television property was tantalizing to Disney allowing it to reap revenue from gate receipts advertising and cable fees. In New York Cablevision does it by owning the Knicks and Rangers and the MSG Network which carries their games locally.The Fox Sports Group owns the Dodgers and shows their games on its Fox Sports West channel.Beyond the failure to start ESPN West Disney is looking to boost its stock price and earnings by selling non-core businesses to focus on theme parks film and television production videos and retailing. Last month it agreed to sell Fairchild Publications for $650 million.The company is doing well with its ownership of ESPN but is working to improve lackluster results at the third-place ABC network.The teams might not have become expendable had they been profitable league champions or had Disney's stock continued to soar as it had when the Eisner-led company never seemed to make a misstep.
 9,The warnings that the bubble is about to burst have been sounded each quarter for the last few years but investors in the stock market continue to ignore them. And so far despite a series of blows lately that were widely expected to take the air out of the balloon they have been right.Sure the Asian economic crisis poses a threat to already slowing corporate profit growth at home. And yes the recent rise in wages could eventually mean a revival of serious inflation. Yet all indications are that the American economy is remarkably sound seemingly indestructible and therefore investors surmise so is Wall Street.That's why midway through 1998 share prices are once again hovering near their all-time highs. The investing public for all the complaints of the professionals remains sanguine about the unheard-of riches being delivered by one of the greatest bull markets in history.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- a widely followed proxy for the larger stock market and millions of index-fund investors -- is up nearly 17 percent this year. The Dow Jones industrial average the best-known market barometer is up 13 percent in a year that many Wall Street pros had forecast full-year gains of less than 8 percent.

 9,FROM far below from the field of dreams came the cadence of summer the pop of ball smacking catcher's mitt the crack of wood against horsehide.It was one of those rare New York events a day game at Yankee Stadium and the charm was divine. There was the pungent smell of hot dogs the bark of a peanut salesman the sea-lion roar of fans letting loose all the emotion they have struggled to hold in elsewhere.Leroy Abraham known as R.J. watched and enjoyed but saw little. The 9-year-old boy could see neither ball nor players. He didn't know the field was green much less what the color green looks like. His eyes could only discern that the sun popped through the clouds. It hurt.Ed Roach an adult who can see sat next to R.J. to field questions that often came with trick hops and a giggle. Mr. Roach first explained to the boy where he was sitting "about four or five stories high" he guessed.

 0,After weeks of opposition by state lawmakers and local officials Gov. George E. Pataki today retreated from his proposal to bill local governments for half the costs of property tax breaks offered to businesses in state economic development zones.Mr. Pataki a Republican made the proposal in his executive budget last month saying that it would save the state about $4 million annually. Currently the state pays $250 million every year to local governments to cover the cost of a variety of tax breaks in 72 specially designated Empire Zones across the state.But the Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver a Democrat and the Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno a Republican opposed the change. This week Mr. Bruno proposed expanding the program by adding 18 more zones mostly in counties that have none.Many state and local government officials also lobbied against Mr. Pataki's plan saying it would not only cost local governments money but would also discourage them from participating in one of the state's most successful economic development programs.

 0,As far as maiden voyages go the first live stream of a Broadway musical was mostly smooth sailing. Save for a few technical hiccups that were resolved by the end of the opening number BroadwayHD’s stream of this enchanting revival of “She Loves Me” did everything right.But theater broadcasts — or streams or both — are not without their challenges. Contractual complexities aside television and live stage productions go together like peanut butter and wine. You can but that doesn’t make it a great idea.In “She Loves Me” which opened in March at Studio 54 Laura Benanti and Zachary Levi star as perfume store clerks falling in love through letters all while loathing each other at work. (It’s based on a play by Miklos Laszlo which also inspired the 1940 film “The Shop Around the Corner” and later “You’ve Got Mail.”)BroadwayHD.com streamed the performance on Thursday at 8 p.m. live to anyone willing to pay $10. It was the first broadcast of its kind; while some opera and ballet performances live-stream in movie theaters this event was for home viewers online through Apple TV and Roku. And while it presented financial artistic and technological complications it also presented an opportunity to reach (and monetize) audiences who would otherwise not have access to Broadway productions.

 9,She realizes now she said that what she thought at the age of 13 - that the father would stay around that they could hold together a family - was largely irrational. ''I was a little child but I didn't look like 13'' she said. ''I had a body like I was older I did talk to everyone as though I was older.''She said she did not use birth control before her first pregnancy. Afterward she took the pill but ''I didn't take it right.''She would get together with her boyfriend - ''he always wanted to be the best guy around the block'' - when his mother was out of her apartment. ''She would go with her boyfriend and I would go to her house with her son'' Ms. Collado recalled. ''He had a five-room apartment. It was real nice we had something going.''She said she would usually leave his house by 9 P.M. so she could get back before her mother then a nurse's aide came home from work.When Ms. Collado delivered her first child her mother left work to look after him and later the second child. ''She had to stop to look after the kids'' Ms. Collado said. ''Now she has arthritis. My mother gets welfare for me my sister and the two babies. When I get home from school I do my mother's job of looking after the kids.''Around her neighborhood in the north Bronx she sees little changing among her friends.''Basically the whole block is all young girls with kids'' she said. ''They're all young 14 or 15. The oldest one is my best friend she's 17 with a 1-year-old. She did it to get out of the house. The youngest girls sleep with anybody they can get. To me they want to be like everybody else. Some of the girls say: 'I slept with this guy.' It's like they did something real big. They're just wasting their time. Who's going to want them?''

 9,Michael Winerip's article made me wonder how many relatives of Jews trapped in Germany or Austria in the late 1930's may have received similar pleas for help. My mother Martha Gomberg received one -- a cable from a distant cousin in danger in Vienna. My mother gathered our family's available funds ($600 I believe) and went from Cleveland to Cuba. Somehow she managed to meet with the president-dictator Fulgencio Batista give him the money and ask him to issue visas for her cousin's family: a mother father and 12-year-old son. I think she had never before been south of Ohio.Miraculously Batista kept his word. Our cousins arrived in Cuba on the last boat that was allowed to discharge refugees. The son was permitted to come to the United States almost immediately. He lived with us for a year until his parents were allowed to enter.After their narrow escape from the Nazis our cousins prospered in this country. One happy ending among so many tragic ones.Joanne NathansBaltimore

 0,The 2017 tax cut has received pretty bad press and rightly so. Its proponents made big promises about soaring investment and wages and also assured everyone that it would pay for itself; none of that has happened.Yet coverage actually hasn’t been negative enough. The story you mostly read runs something like this: The tax cut has caused corporations to bring some money home but they’ve used it for stock buybacks rather than to raise wages and the boost to growth has been modest. That doesn’t sound great but it’s still better than the reality: No money has in fact been brought home and the tax cut has probably reduced national income. Indeed at least 90 percent of Americans will end up poorer thanks to that cut.Let me explain each point in turn.First when people say that U.S. corporations have “brought money home” they’re referring to dividends overseas subsidiaries have paid to their parent corporations. These did indeed surge briefly in 2018 as the tax law made it advantageous to transfer some assets from the books of those subsidiaries to the home companies; these transactions also showed up as a reduction in the measured stake of the parents in the subsidiaries i.e. as negative direct investment (Figure 1).

 0,Dear Simon Branson: Today is going to be a good day and here’s why.Oh wait wrong show.But a person could be forgiven for momentarily confusing “Superhero” the new musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother with “Dear Evan Hansen” the hit musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother.It’s not just that the boys’ names scan so similarly. Or that both shows are about fatherless families: Evan’s the result of divorce; Simon’s the result of an accident. The opening songs (“Anybody Have a Map?” in “Dear Evan Hansen” and “What’s Happening to My Boy?” in “Superhero”) have nearly identical emotional setups including nearly identical phrases about mothers finding their way back to their sons.More fundamentally both “Superhero” and “Dear Evan Hansen” show how damaged people try to use stories whether fictional or outright false to rebuild themselves after trauma — and how they may create new traumas in the process.
 0,Season 1 Episode 11: ‘Black Friday’Did anything of substance happen on this week’s episode of “Scream Queens”? Of course using the word “substance” in connection with this show is an incongruity but you know what I mean. We learned that Dean Munsch whom the Chanels tried to kill several times is apparently immune to puffer fish venom and to being frozen to death in a cryotherapy chamber. We learned that Pete has apparently murdered someone. But did the story move forward much? Did any major characters or even minor ones die? Did the episode have some redeeming value like being amusing? No. Maybe this should have been a 10-episode series. (Two more to go.)The Chanels shook off their discomfort at having found Gigi’s head on their turkey platter last week and headed for the mall for Black Friday lingering too long and getting locked inside it. The Red Devil soon turned up and the secondary Chanels escaped but Chanel No. 1 decided to confront Red and she was shot with a crossbow for her troubles. Either Chanel like the dean has an unkillable quality or there really is a place in the upper body where one can be shot with an arrow yet not bleed even a little. Anyway good old Denise now the police chief showed up and saved the day if by saving the day you mean “let the killer get away.”There was some infighting in the sorority over whether to murder Dean Munsch on the presumption that she is the serial killer and Grace was ultimately tossed out of the group for refusing to stay on board. After the poisoning and freezing fiascoes a third assassination attempt fell apart when the lesser Chanels got distracted by an argument over underwear and failed to turn up at the assigned killing spot.Then Grace visited Pete who was busy packing to leave town because he’s somehow involved in something shady. She offered him her virginity but he wasn’t interested. “I can’t because I don’t want your first time to be with a murderer” he told her. Hmm. End of (an uneventful) episode.

 9,Kentucky should be happier to have him. He is gracious he is gentlemanly and he is the man you want coaching your son. He has actually coached both of his sons G. G. at Georgia and Saul at Kentucky and Cameron Mills was one of several players who called him a father figure. Anyone call Rupp that and mean it? Even some of Pitino's former players conceded he cared about little besides their basketball skills.Tubby Smith has always been his own man.''Ever since he was first hired there was all that hype about him being the first black coach at Kentucky'' Mills said. ''There was all the pressure he endured for himself and the fans after the losses when people said he wasn't Rick Pitino. Well he's not Rick Pitino. He's Tubby Smith. And they both have a national title.''Jeff Sheppard the closest player to a star that Smith had in a program that has lost five first-round draft picks in the last two seasons said ''He does a really good job of teaching us basketball but even a better job of teaching us how to be men.''One of the more irritating aspects of college basketball is that the coaches often receive too much attention. Not to add to that but Smith deserved a bundle of praise for helping the Wildcats erase a 10-point deficit the largest overcome during a title game to enable Kentucky to win the school's seventh national championship. The comeback might have satisfied even the fan who talked about the Wildcats then 21-3 on a Feb. 11 radio show by saying ''I haven't given up on them yet.''That sounded ludicrous then and more so now. Under Smith this team obliterated a 17-point deficit in the final nine minutes against Duke in the South Regional and rallied from 10 points back to beat Stanford in the national semifinals. In the title game Smith made three clever adjustments and substituted like a savant after Utah's man-to-man steered it to a 41-31 lead at the half.

Dec 2— Pennsylvania has broadened its program for insuring against loss to property on the surface that results from the collapse of old underground mines.Amendments to the 1961 law setting up the insurance pro gram were signed by Gov.

 0,To me the best way to think about reading is as life's grand second chance. All of us grow up once: we pass through a process of socialization. We learn about right and wrong and good and bad from our parents then from our teachers or religious guides. Gradually we are instilled with the common sense that conservative writers like Edmund Burke and Samuel Johnson thought of as a great collective work. To them common sense is infused with all that has been learned over time through trial and error human frustration sorrow and joy. In fact a well-socialized being is something like a work of art.Yet for many people the process of socialization doesn't quite work. The values they acquire from all the well-meaning authorities don't fit them. And it is these people who often become obsessed readers. They don't read for information and they don't read for beautiful escape. No they read to remake themselves. They read to be socialized again not into the ways of their city or village this time but into another world with different values. Such people want to revise or even to displace the influence their parents have had on them. They want to adopt values they perceive to be higher or perhaps just better suited to their natures.When Walt Whitman picked up the work of his older contemporary Ralph Waldo Emerson he was a carpenter framing two- and three-room houses in Brooklyn. He had been a journalist; he had written some mediocre fiction -- he looked to be someone who would never amount to much. After reading the great essays Whitman purportedly said: ''I was simmering simmering simmering. Emerson brought me to a boil.''Whitman had been reared to be modest and self-effacing. But Emerson offered him a new image of authority. He was for a while Whitman's second father. Obviously it takes more than reading a book to create a Walt Whitman. But the act of reading Emerson was still at the center of what is probably the most marvelous transformation in the history of literature.Similar things happen in the lives of everyday individuals all the time. I remember very well what it was like when at 17 I read ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X.'' Malcolm had spent time in Boston not far from where I lived and he had something to say about our common territory. He gave me a sense of how bitter and brutal it could be to be a black man right there in Massachusetts. There was a low-key race war on between white and black at my high school and because of Malcolm I began to try seeing it from the black point of view. I got into trouble which was sometimes more than just verbal trouble with my white buddies. And not every black kid in the school was pleased to see a white guy with his nose in Malcolm X.
 9,Cards and letters and calls are making their way to the powers that be. The Rockland County Commission on Human Rights the Rockland County Historical Society the Historical Society of Bergen County and various scholars have weighed in to support the tribe's petition for recognition. Finally Chief Van Dunk says he is getting an inkling from the tribe's lawyers that someone in the Department of the Interior might be taking the Ramapoughs seriously. "The Government realizes we're not going away" he said.The Ramapoughs say they have been here tucked in the craggy landscape straddling the New York-New Jersey border since well before the border existed. The tribe traces its ancestry back 5000 years to the Lenape tribe. But it has had a time proving it. Two years ago the Bureau of Indian Affairs denied the tribe's petition on the ground that their lineage could not be traced effectively.BUT another issue is at least partly to blame: casino gambling. Political opposition to the Ramapoughs' petition grew after Federal law allowed gaming operations on tribal lands. Mr. Torricelli a Democrat from Englewood initially supported the tribe's petition and even wrote letters on its behalf. But he changed his mind he said when he realized the Ramapoughs were "only interested in opening a casino." This despite the fact that the Ramapoughs applied for Federal recognition nine years before the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act became law.Even if the tribe decides to open a casino -- Mr. Van Dunk says it does not plan to although he would not rule it out -- should that determine whether the Government recognizes its ancestry?New Jersey politicians know that the Atlantic City casino operators have been worried about recognition of the Ramapoughs for some time. In 1993 when the tribe's petition was pending six members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation sent a joint letter to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit calling the tribe's claims "dubious" and warning of the negative impact a casino in Bergen County (30 minutes from Manhattan) would have on Atlantic City.

 0,I’m not used to being a cheerleader for the Bush administration. But when I saw recently that the president had convened a National Math Panel to study in part the effectiveness of teaching kids so-called “constructivist” math I stood up put my hand over my heart and shouted “Amen.”About six months ago The New York Times published a fascinating article about a town of engineers and scientists in Penfield N.Y. who were gradually waking up to the fact that their kids educated in a constructivist or “inquiry” program which emphasized pupils’ “constructing their own knowledge” rather than learning math formulas or computational rules were unable by junior high school to make change at McDonald’s or multiply two-digit numbers.I came upon this article at precisely the time I was trying to get my own constructivist-schooled third-grader to stop adding and subtracting on her fingers so I read it with great interest – and dismay.School officials in Penfield dismissed parents’ complaints about the curriculum by saying that math scores had steadily increased since the late 1990’s when teaching constructivist math became the local norm. Yet there was evidence that this improvement had less to do with the school’s instruction than the fact that parents were increasingly teaching their kids old-fashioned math methods themselves. Even the town math champion who’d been paraded around as a poster boy for constructivist math when he’d become the top scorer on his high school math team and earned a perfect 5 on his advanced placement calculus exam had it turned out been “covertly tutored” in traditional math by his parents.“My whole experience in math the last few years has been a struggle against the [constructivist] program” he told the Times. “Whatever I’ve achieved I’ve achieved in spite of it. Kids do not do better learning math themselves. There’s a reason we go to school which is that there’s someone smarter than us with something to teach us.”I hear stories like this all the time in Washington D.C. where the constructivist program Everyday Math — also known as Chicago math — is taught just about everywhere and where old-fashioned strategies like flash cards and basic memorization are dismissively shrugged off as “drill and kill.” As in Penfield where hundreds of kids now are in remediation classes to learn basic computation I see parents in D.C. routinely outsourcing their kids’ basic math instruction either to tutors or to themselves.This does not appear to bother those parents who have seemingly unlimited amounts of money or time. (I’ll always remember the way a table of parents at a private school I once visited crowed as a teacher walked by “He’s our favorite math teacher! He tutors all our kids!”) But for parents who are already stretched and stressed it feels deeply unfair. It’s troubling too to watch kids walk away from the classroom experience with the belief that they themselves are deficient.It would be wonderful to think that the Bush administration’s new math initiative will put the needs of these kids center stage and take a truly judicious approach to figuring out how best to serve their needs. I fear though that much is working against that outcome. The debate over teaching math already dubbed the “math wars” (for a one-sided sampling see this collection of articles) has quickly become ideological as did the earlier debate over how best to teach reading (conservative phonics vs. progressive “whole language” learning). And that’s a great pity because politics have little in common with what works best for children in the classroom: flexibility and open-mindedness on the part of instructors for starters.There’s much to recommend constructivist math – it’s often fun it keeps kids engaged and it allows them when it works to embark upon more intellectually challenging kinds of number problems than their grade level would normally permit. (In my daughter Julia’s case once we began to supplement the school’s curriculum with flash cards and the “Multiplication Rock” CD she began to find math “easy” and “fun.”) But like the whole language approach to reading which can work miracles for some kids yet is nightmarish for others constructivist math doesn’t work for everyone – and from what I’ve come to understand it really shouldn’t be taught in isolation to any child.All kids regardless of their individual strengths weaknesses or styles learning specialists say need to be grounded in the basic building blocks of math and language skills before they can take the next great leap into creative thinking or abstract thought or more advanced mathematics. The best classrooms – the best teachers – mix their methods and present information to different students in different ways. In other words teachers shouldn’t be narrow-minded and curricula shouldn’t become dogma.It takes money though to train or hire teachers who have the knowledge and know-how to tailor their teaching styles to students’ individual learning needs. And it takes smaller class sizes than most schools can now afford. So far neither of those costly realities has registered high on the president’s list of educational priorities. No wonder critics of the Bush administration’s attempt to take on this issue worry that this latest and largest staged battle in the math wars has been lost in advance.That the administration has brought the long-simmering debate over constructivist math to the front burner of national consciousness is undoubtedly a good thing. But I predict that if this curricular issue immediately gets caught up in the battleground of left and right and becomes an either/or standardized-test-defined cost-efficiency issue then the needs of our nations’ kids are sure to be shunted out of the equation.
 0,How We Got Here
 9,Fin swimming in which competitors use rubber fins to add a powerful boost to their kick is a fast sport that has been making slow progress in the United States since it was imported from Europe a few years ago. Now one version of it seems to have reached its high-water mark.The first United States Eastern Fin Swimming Championships held March 21 at Westchester Community College in Valhalla N.Y. were also billed as the first such meet anywhere in a short-course pool (25 yards) rather than in a 50-meter long-course. As a result of the experience they may be the last. As the 15 entrants discovered the speed advantage that fin swimming enjoys over barefoot swimming on long courses disappears when a short course is used and for an obvious reason: The flippers that add so much power to a kick are a distinct disadvantage in making a flip turn.In long-course events the superiority of fins is substantial. For example the world 50-meter freestyle record is 22.33 seconds while the fin swimming record for the same event is a blistering 15.4. In the 100 the world swimming record is 48.74 while the fin swimming record is 38.2. (Fin records incidentally would presumably be even lower if the best swimmers took up the sport. As it is fin swimmers tend to be scuba divers.) In the Eastern championships Gary Antonick of Virgina Beach won the one-flip-turn 50-yard apnea an underwater event in 18.1 seconds only slightly faster than the American swimming record of 19.22. Peppo Biscarini of Los Angeles who had to use his flippers for three flip turns won the 100-yard event in 43.3 seconds actually slower than the finless record of 41.87.The meet organizer Frank May who settled on the 25-yard Westchester pool only because there were no Olympic-size pools available in the metropolitan area said later that he wasn't sure about an encore next year. In the meantime he figures that the 1987 championships were a watershed: Every winner set a short-course record.

 0,“I’m a crazy chair collector and have way too many” Joe Nahem said. But there’s good reason for that he explained. Chairs – particularly lounge chairs – are among the most exciting furniture purchases you can make.“They can be sculpture in a room” said Mr. Nahem an interior designer in his 50s who more than 30 years ago as a student at Parsons School of Design was a founder of the New York firm Fox-Nahem Associates. “They give you an opportunity – since they’re usually floating in a room rather than positioned against a wall – to do something special.”Mr. Nahem frequently designs custom pieces for his clients but he has also spent countless hours shopping for lounge chairs both for clients and for himself. And there are a few things he always considers.• How will the shape of a chair influence a room’s layout? “If it’s a square chair everything in the room has to be lined up” he said so nothing looks askew. But “when you use a chair that’s a little rounded it can be positioned anywhere which can make things less stiff.”• Is it a chair you’ll use every day? If so comfort is key. “But not every chair has to be so comfortable you’re going to fall asleep in it” he said. Especially if it’s an occasional chair used as movable seating for guests.• Do you need more than one? “We often use pairs” to create symmetry Mr. Nahem said. “Another setup we love is to have three chairs around an ottoman which is a great secondary seating arrangement in a large room.”

 0,Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.The only thing foggier than war itself may be the path to its frightening if too often exhilarating outbreak. Indeed the secession crisis and road to civil war took an enormous emotional toll on Americans of every persuasion and in every corner of the land. Few however expressed themselves as publicly or eloquently as Frederick Douglass. “I have never spent days so restless and anxious” he said in an early April 1861 lecture at Rochester’s Spring Street A.M.E. Zion Church. “Our mornings and evenings have continually oscillated between the dim light of hope and the gloomy shadow of despair.”Library of CongressIt was a time of great activity for Douglass. Throughout the winter he had helped organize a weekly series of antislavery lectures on Sundays at the Spring Street church. Although he was himself the most frequent speaker many other prominent abolitionists addressed the gatherings including Susan B. Anthony Parker Pillsbury and Jermain Loguen. Douglass also wrote fervidly: since he could not directly affect a policy that might now emerge from the turbulent atmosphere of Washington he took to his pen for solace and for spirit. As editor orator and autobiographer his words and the example of his own story were after all his only real weapons against slavery. But he also knew their power: throughout the 1850s Douglass had learned well that words were the currency of politics. Now even words though were in flux. “The strangest feature of this eventful drama” he proclaimed “is the complete inversion of the sense of…words.”Rochester lay deep within Unionist territory but the ebb and flow of national politics reached the church doors: the meetings had moved to Zion which served a community of nearly 300 blacks in late January after a convention of abolitionists meeting in Rochester’s majestic Corinthian Hall was disrupted by a mob and closed down by police. By early February a white workingmen’s convention drew a large turnout to endorse sectional “compromise” in the crisis which was precisely what Douglass and abolitionists most feared. On the other hand on Feb. 18 a throng estimated at 15000 gathered at the Rochester train station as President-elect Abraham Lincoln passed through on his storied whistle-stop journey to Washington.Related Civil War Timeline An unfolding history of the Civil War with photos and articles from the Times archive and ongoing commentary from Disunion contributors. Visit the Timeline »To abolitionists like Douglass who dearly yearned for a breakup of the Union that might threaten slavery through unpredictable means and events all was uncertain as Lincoln glided through town. A divided nation watched and awaited what the new president would do about the wayward “Confederate” states of the Deep South which were busy seizing federal forts arsenals courts and post offices.Douglass minced no words in announcing his own definition of the secessionists: They were “traitors and rebels” who had “robbed plundered insulted spit upon and defiled” the United States government he angrily wrote in February. “Treason” and “Armed Rebellion” he complained were “now simply the sovereign right of Secession and the execution of the Laws is now called ‘Coercion.’” To Douglass the secessionists were the mortal enemies of the “Government” (which he began to capitalize) as well as of his cause of abolition. Traitors merited no quarter and he repeatedly insisted on his own label for their movement – the “treasonable Slaveholding Confederacy.”But secessionist treason was “exceeded” by Northern acquiescence Douglass contended in “the sneaking cowardice and pitiful imbecility of the Government [the Buchanan administration] and the Northern people who are mobbing down freedom of speech crying ‘no coercion’ and whining for compromise.” Douglass had been practicing this kind of rhetoric about slaveholders for years; by 1861 it was as if the secessionists had flipped his switch into overdrive.Library of CongressBy the eve of Lincoln’s inauguration March 4 Douglass’s “doubt and distraction” had all but consumed him. He was not yet connected to the Republican Party establishment and had no personal ties to Lincoln’s inner circle. He truly did not know which impulses or rumors about the new president’s impending actions to trust. Whatever Lincoln’s policy would be towards slavery and “our nation’s troubles” he declared it would “be a great relief to know.” Lincoln’s “stately silence” throughout the crisis left Douglass guessing but he did take hope from the Illinoisan’s “cool and circumspect” resistance thus far to all major compromise measures bandied about in public debate. Grasping for confidence Douglass said Lincoln had “not won deceitfully the title of Honest Old Abe.”Tense and writing from his lonely late winter outpost in Rochester speaking for radical abolitionists and on Sundays to a small black congregation as well as to his white antislavery neighbors and allies Douglass worried that the “atmosphere of the Capitol” would yet infect the “moral health” of Lincoln and the Republicans. But with only days to wait for the inaugural message Douglass simply offered that “all our hopes” were with the new president’s resolve. All along he had yearned that the South’s “gigantic and systematized Treason” had with time irrevocably “bound up the fate of the Republic and that of the slave in the same bundle.” Neither he nor anyone quite knew yet the deep irony of that truth.Join Disunion on Facebook »David W.

Corrigan unpacks 12 essential phrases from “I don’t know” to “I love you” that as she puts it “turn the wheel of life.”& NoteworthyIn which we ask colleagues at The Times what they’re reading now.“The last time I read PERSONAL HISTORY by Katharine Graham was in 2015 after almost nine years of working for The Washington Post her newspaper. What struck me most then though was her description of her young adulthood in the nation’s capital and the ‘legions of young men in Washington who grouped together to live in houses.’ Katharine Meyer and Philip L. Graham met at a group-house party in D.C.! I had suffered through so many myself and mostly what I got were in-person recitations of funny things people had said on Twitter. I’m reading her book for a third time now after being predictably charmed by the new movie ‘The Post.’ It is remarkable to watch Meryl Streep as Graham decide to publish the Pentagon Papers then read that decision rendered in Graham’s own words. By the time you reach that point in the book she has talked candidly about pregnancy loss personal friendships with several presidents her husband’s suicide — and the way she made history in a job she was never really expected to have. Maybe that would have been too long a movie but it’s worth treating yourself to the source material.”— Rachel Dry editor of Sunday Review
 0,As wartime speeches go it was a strange and schizophrenic one laying its emphasis on two not-necessarily-compatible goals — victory and a swift withdrawal. In one breath Obama was echoing his previous description of Afghanistan as a “war of necessity” referencing our “vital national interests” and describing the conflict’s stakes as both “the security of our Allies and the common security of the world.” The next he was offering the Taliban a date to circle on their calendars and hold out for throughout the American offensive to come — July of 2011 that is when the Obama administration is now committed to beginning the withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan. This commitment of course was hedged with a substantial caveat: “We will execute this transition responsibly taking into account conditions on the ground.” But still the date is there: After more than eight years of fighting the United States our enemies know that we’ve set ourselves a deadline to win or get out that’s only a short eighteen months away.Judged solely as policy simultaneously escalating and setting ourselves a near-term deadline might be the right approach to a war that may not be winnable but that deserves a more significant commitment before we give it up as lost. But the White House could have set itself a private deadline without telling the world exactly what it is. And I’m skeptical that making the deadline so public and so specific won’t tend to undercut our military efforts. In the portion of the speech that aimed to pre-empt criticism from right and left alike Obama argued that “the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government.” But surely there are plenty of reasons for this administration to feel (and instill) a sense of urgency — from the weight of public opinion to the restiveness of the Democratic base to the strain on our military and our alliances — without adding the burden of a public deadline as well!Broadly speaking it struck me as one of Obama’s least effective speeches. I can’t imagine any anti-war liberal being convinced to favor escalation by his arguments. I can’t imagine any pro-escalation conservative feeling confident that Obama is really committed to the effort he’s embarking on. And above all I can’t imagine any up-in-the-air uncertain American being reassured that we have a military strategy capable of delivering a successful outcome — because Obama barely seemed to talk about military strategy at all.Indeed in this regard I think it’s worth comparing tonight’s speech unfavorably to George W. Bush’s address announcing the Iraqi surge. Whereas that speech was tightly focused on the shift in military and diplomatic strategy Obama’s remarks tried to cover the history of the American involvement in Afghanistan the state of our domestic politics and even the nature of America’s mission in the world while pre-butting various possible attacks on his decision-making. Obama was more comprehensive; Bush was much better. And now we have to hope that the President’s strategy is more successful than his speech.

 9,That was a short offseason in college football. Penn State which won the top ranking in last season's final college football polls has lost the first coin toss of the 1983 season.At a meeting of the commissioners of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority yesterday Nebraska won the right to wear its home red jerseys for the game against the Nittany Lions at Giants Stadium on Aug.29 in the first annual Kickoff Classic. The National Collegiate Athletic Association has approved the classic as the official season opener.

 0,CLIFFWOOD N.J. — On a stormy Saturday a group of young boys wearing red soccer uniforms and cleats in a dizzying array of colors clip-clopped out of the rain and into an old warehouse where wealthy residents of this historic community along Raritan Bay once stored their antique cars.That space is now occupied by an unlikely tenant and serving a very different clientele. Xolos Academy F.C. New Jersey a soccer academy affiliated with the Mexican first-division team Club Tijuana has transformed the warehouse into a synthetic-turf field of dreams its walls covered with logos and action photos of a favorite son.They coach soccer here now but what the academy really offers is opportunity for the sons and daughters of Hispanic immigrants from the area. These are the kind of players who routinely fall through the cracks of American soccer victims of financial hardships that sometimes prevent their talents from being properly nurtured and exposed in the pay-to-play culture that dominates youth soccer in the United States.“Some of these players have been kept in the shadows simply because they could not afford to play the game they love” said Joe DiMauro a longtime coach and trainer who runs the warehouse academy. It is the fifth American affiliate of Club Tijuana and the first in the Northeastern United States.

 0,The freshman wide receiver Josh Jarboe was dismissed Friday from the Oklahoma football team just three days after a crude Internet video surfaced that showed him freestyle rapping about guns shooting people and having sex.The Tulsa World first reported Jarboe’s dismissal after his Friday morning meeting with Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops.“We are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and the final decision is in the best interest of the program” Stoops said in a statement. “We outlined for Josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met. Josh needs to learn from this experience. We hope he can move forward in a positive manner.”The 74-second video of Jarboe rapping was posted Tuesday on the Oklahoma fan site Reddirtkings.com after previously showing up on YouTube. In May the 6-foot-3 195-pound Jarboe pleaded guilty to bringing a gun to Ellenwood (Ga.) Cedar Grove High School and carrying a pistol without a license. The charges were originally felonies but they were reduced to misdemeanors.Jarboe who was rated among the Class of 2008’s top 10 wide receivers by Rivals.com was sentenced to two years of probation and 80 hours of community service but was still allowed to enroll at Oklahoma. He signed with the Sooners in February and was arrested the next month.The timing of Jarboe’s dismissal is interesting because Stoops told The Oklahoman columnist Berry Tramel on Thursday that he wouldn’t kick Jarboe off the team for his video.“We’re starting to talk about everything kids say and do” Stoops told Tramel. “Now we’re in people’s homes in their private spaces.”Despite Stoops’s initial reticence to dismiss him someone apparently didn’t want an encore from Jarboe.
 9,Lieut. Gen. Frederick Franks Jr. who commanded the American armor that broke through to crush the Iraqi Republican Guard strongly urged his forces today to maintain a wary vigilance even though the single entry on his headquarters bulletin board proclaimed: "Ceasefire. 0800. 28 Feb. 91."General Franks a 52-year-old officer who had lost his right leg in combat in the Vietnam war offered his warnings in his first interview since his men began to play their pivotal role in the 100-hour ground war. "We have to continue to be ready and alert" he said in elaborating on the theme of preparedness that was spreading among the tens of thousands of victorious soldiers.Sgt. Maj. Robert E. Wilson the highest ranking noncommissioned officer in the VII Corps said "It's just a very dangerous time right now the uncertainty."Referring to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq he added: "This guy may rally some people who get across and try something stupid I hope for his sake he doesn't. In Vietnam they just used the cease-fire to resupply."

 0,Over the course of two acts and 2 hours and 25 minutes under the gummy direction of Steven Carl McCasland (who also plays Howie) these characters scramble around the stage trading clunky wisecracks until one by one they bite the dust. Needless to say none meets his or her demise too soon or in a manner that is either thrilling or entertaining.Taking my cue from Mr. Rich who forbore to mention the names of the unfortunate actors in his review I will do the same except to note that at least the Snooks of Brittany Velotta has a certain ghastly verve as does the crazed tapping of Caroline Rosenblum as Gay.To have witnessed the unbelievable antics of these characters from a seat in the Eugene O’Neill Theater a venerable Broadway house must have been a truly surreal experience. Watching the same ludicrous proceedings as they unfold on the scuffed stage of the Connelly Theater in the East Village on a flimsy set that would seem skimpy even for a middle school production of “The Man Who Came to Dinner” does not feel like an epochal experience. It’s barely an endurable one.True it is perhaps easier now to guffaw heartily at exclamations like “I don’t know about the rest of you but I could sure use a drink” or “Does this madness never end?” But come to think of it I can’t really recall if that last was a line from the play or an outburst that inadvertently escaped from my lips. In this case Siri remained silent.
 0,Of course Taurasi “relaxed” in her own way: She’d work out 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily with weights flexibility on-court drills and yoga for what she described as a physical and psychological “three-month reconstruction of myself.”“It’s a credit to her for all the work that she continues to put into her game and to her body into her mind everything” Mercury Coach Sandy Brondello said. “Because at 36 years of age to go out and play at the level that she plays at really is amazing. I’m in awe of her sometimes.”It is a testament to her leadership that her offensive game has evolved in a way that maximizes what Griner 27 has grown into. Once a pure under-the-basket threat Griner has developed a feathery touch and a confidence in her ability to take over games that have changed the equation for teams game-planning for the Mercury.“Everybody’s kind of always had a little bit more faith in my shot than me and I had to work on it overseas and get comfortable with taking it” Griner said noting that she and Taurasi have been teammates for years with UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia. “But then it also has helped me out a lot just so I don’t have to go down and bang on the block all night long.“Defenders tend to leave me open on the elbow and when I step out so it was only the smart thing to do to start to knock down the shots so they can’t leave me open up there.”The result is a greatly diversified Griner. In the 2014 season Griner took 55 shots from 11 to 15 feet making 50.9 percent of them. She had already taken 71 shots from that distance and made 54.9 percent of them before this season’s All-Star break. The difference is even starker from 16 to 21 feet the spots on the floor vacated by Taurasi. In 2014 Griner shot 1-for-8 from that distance; she was 18-for-41 before the All-Star break this year.

 9,After two years of criticism from Federal environmental officials Gov. George E. Pataki has announced plans to strengthen New York State's enforcement of environmental laws particularly those limiting air pollution from large sources like factories and power plants.The biggest shift would be an increase in inspections for pollution problems and a new emphasis on pursuing the worst violators. Those two factors were identified by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency as particularly weak in New York State last year.Senior E.P.A. officials said Mr. Pataki's planned changes could end a long decline in environmental enforcement in New York that began late in the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and worsened under Mr. Pataki. Some private environmental groups and political opponents were less optimistic.A low point was reached last year according to the E.P.A.'s continuing analysis of the state's programs. The Federal analysis concluded that fines were consistently too low inspections were far too few and the pursuit of big companies discharging hundreds of tons of pollutants into the air was ''minimal.''

 0,From all appearances Or seems to have long ago assumed the role of the responsible one in the family: she collects bottles and cans for money works as a dishwasher in a restaurant owned by a sympathetic neighbor and keeps up the family's cramped cluttered apartment as best she can. In turn Ruthie recently returned from a hospital stay behaves like one of those out-of-control adolescents who show up on cable television: she dresses like Slattern Barbie refuses to get up in the morning sneaks out at night keeps bad company and whines a lot.Shot in an unadorned style that makes everything look fairly grotty the women included the film mixes scenes of quotidian life with melodramatic incident and then the whole thing grinds to a stop. Along the way Ms. Yedaya and her co-writer Sari Ezouz build the case that prostitutes are purely victims and that prostitution is so pathological so radically dehumanizing that the prostitute herself is little more than an empty shell.In this formulation prostitution isn't a lousy way to make a living; it's an iron cage with a rusted lock. Ruthie and Or are victims not only of poverty male opportunism and social indifference but also of their actions and desires which don't really belong to them in any meaningful sense because well everything they do and feel is symptomatic of their pathological existence.Ms. Yedaya's take on prostitution would be tolerable if her characters especially Ruthie weren't such ideological constructs. A monster from her gaudy blue eye-shadow to her Frankenstein platforms Ruthie insists on breaking her daughter's heart by turning tricks. She says they need the money but something else clearly drives her into the streets. But because Ms. Yedaya refuses to give Ruthie a hint of a dreamscape a moment outside that iron cage we never learn what makes her tick.That Ruthie might get something she needs from prostitution however unhealthy is something the film refuses to consider; worse there's a suggestion that Or's teenage lust is a symptom of Ruthie's pathology rather than something good and real and human. Prostitution isn't the only disease in this film; so is desire.

 9,So for America Online the reasons to help Comcast fight AT&T are clear. If a combined America Online-Comcast succeeds in acquiring Mediaone America Online will get a guaranteed channel for selling its services to consumers over cable modems. (Even if America Online does not end up participating in a bid for Mediaone it will still get high-speed links to millions of homes through its deals with local Bell phone companies.)The problem for America Online may be that Comcast needs cash. While Comcast's standing offer for Mediaone is all stock AT&T has offered most of an AT&T share plus almost $31 in cash for each share of Mediaone. And in the largest syndicated financing to date managed by Goldman Sachs & Company and Chase Manhattan Bank AT&T has already lined up $30 billion in commitments from lenders to back up its offer.Comcast does not have that kind of financial firepower and America Online may not either. At the end of the last quarter America Online had only $1.8 billion in cash on hand. Even if it could raise a few billion more it would still not be in AT&T's league.One obvious solution for America Online would be to use its stock which has given the company a market value of about $130 billion. But Mediaone's shareholders may have qualms about taking America Online shares which trade at about 400 times estimated earnings. Valuations of that nature may not be sustainable especially if America Online becomes part owner of a cable company since cable companies are generally valued much more conservatively.In addition accepting a bundle of America Online and Comcast shares would not be wholly tax-free for Mediaone's shareholders -- although taking a mix of cash and AT&T stock would not be wholly tax-free either.In some ways Microsoft's position is the opposite of America Online's. Microsoft has almost $22 billion in cash on hand but does not seem to have an obvious strategic reason to go to war against AT&T. Microsoft would like to sell software for high-speed Internet connections but Microsoft and AT&T could find many mutually profitable ways to work together. Microsoft has invested $1 billion in Comcast but that alone would not seem reason enough to make a strategic enemy of AT&T.Mr. Allen may be the most intriguing candidate for Comcast. He has already invested heavily in the cable television industry and he may not care about working with AT&T in the future.

 9,The United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that the diversity of its product line helped net income in the fourth quarter of last year to rise 15.7 percent to $112.8 million or $1.78 a share from $97.5 million or $1.51 a share in the fourth quarter of 1981. Revenues edged up to $3.54 billion from $3.51 billion.For the full year the big Hartford-based technology and aerospace concern increased earnings 16.6 percent to $533.7 million or $8.74 a share from $457.7 million or $7.71 a share in 1981. Revenues eased to $13.58 billion from $13.67 billion.Results for the year included the cumulative effect of a previously announced accounting change for investment tax credits of $66.6 million in the first quarter and a $40.2 million tax-free extraordinary gain resulting from an exchange in the second quarter of common stock and cash for United Technologies' debentures.Excluding the accounting change and extraordinary gain net income in 1982 fell 6.7 percent to $426.9 million from $457.7 million. Harry J. Gray chairman president and chief executive said the company had ''held its own in 1982 in the face of the roughest economy in decades'' while its diversity of business and strong market positions softened the impact of lower volume and substantially higher research and development investments.

 0,On a first encounter little about Mr. Rando cries out ''make 'em laugh.'' Tall and lean with clean-cut good looks he gives the impression of one better suited to orderliness than mayhem one who might prefer to do his experimenting in a laboratory rather than on a stage. (He grew up in Houston where his father is an aerospace engineer.) And his training was not exactly of the clown-college variety. After graduating from the University of Texas where he concentrated in German Italian and English literature he won a Fulbright fellowship to study theater in Europe. He later did graduate work in theater at the University of California at Los Angeles.Still he shone in comic roles in undergraduate productions and in his early stagings of plays like ''Twelfth Night'' he showed a flair for bringing the madcap elements of the classics fully to life. ''After a couple of shows at the Pearl people would say to me 'I'm really impressed by your style' '' he recalled. ''Until someone said that I didn't know I had a style.''He is regarded by those who work with him as a genuine actors' director a gentle source of encouragement who does not crowd the rehearsal room with his own ego. ''John laughs at every rehearsal'' said Nancy Opel an actress who is a favorite of both Mr. Ives and Mr. Rando and plays the corrupt proprietor of a public urinal in ''Urinetown.'' ''He laughs every time. If you think the director is tired of you then you get restless.''I would say if he had a fault it's that he's probably too kind to actors. He's got a lot of patience with everybody and it takes a little longer to get to the result that he wanted because he's so willing to let people try things.''Mr. Rando said he had learned that leadership could be a matter of pointing someone in the direction they were already headed. ''The way I like to work is that sometimes you do your best work when others are doing their best work'' he explained. ''It's about coaching prodding.''And sometimes a firmer hand is required. In a tongue-in-cheek show like ''Urinetown'' which was created by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis and pokes fun at everything from ''The Threepenny Opera'' to ''West Side Story'' the challenge was to ensure the broad comedy did not become sophomoric. ''I knew that it needed to be as bare bones as I could make it'' Mr. Rando said. To that end the minimal scenery consists of a network of catwalks and a wall on wheels that serves a variety of functions; in one song the wall is intentionally pitched so far downstage that the actors performing in front of it are pushed into the laps of theatergoers.It is a bit of a leap from ''Urinetown'' to ''A Thousand Clowns'' a play about a former television writer (Mr. Selleck) whose eccentric ways put his guardianship of his 12-year-old nephew into jeopardy. A 1996 revival by the Roundabout Theater Company was disappointing: hampered by the departures before the opening of its director and leading actors the production felt dated. But Mr. Rando said the questions the play asked about personal responsibility had convinced him it could be as relevant today as it was in the early 1960's.

 0,Lara Stone isn’t your typical runway android. She walks like Lurch and you can’t tell from her stunned expression if she’s going to burst into tears or belt you in the chops. But we love her. She’s 23 Dutch and she has a little gap between her front teeth.“They say in French that it’s good luck” Stone told me last night in the Givenchy backstage. She’s had a lucky year. Overlooked until Riccardo Tisci put her in his Givenchy couture shows Stone has a big Bardot-like spread in this month’s Paris Vogue; she gets the cover (in Chloé) for April. “Sometimes a girl just touches you” Carine Roitfeld the magazine’s editor said. As for Stone’s awkward gait the explanation is almost too dopey for words.

 9,Newly armed with the entertainment and merchandising might of the Walt Disney Company the ABC television network has with one bold stroke become the prototype of the television company of the future.The combined assets of ABC and Disney will transform the network into the dominant programming power in television so strong that Wall Street analysts said yesterday that ABC's rivals NBC and CBS may be forced into similar mergers just to compete with the new ABC juggernaut.ABC a unit of Capital Cities/ABC will be uniquely positioned to sell more programs internationally than any other production studio and to market and merchandise program-product tie-ins on a scale that will dwarf anything a broadcaster has ever previously attempted executives from Disney and ABC said in interviews yesterday.These are examples of new businesses the merged company could initiate:*A combination of sports programs from the ABC-owned cable channel ESPN and children's programs from the Disney cable channel that can be sold to international broadcasters who want more of those two kinds of programs.

 9,To the Editor:Your Oct. 31 front-page article about the ancient enmities producing continuing clashes between the Hutu and Tutsi communities in Zaire Rwanda and Burundi brings back memories of my experiences with the genocide in Burundi when I was the United States Ambassador there from 1969 to 1972.The 1972 Hutu-Tutsi confrontation resulting in more than 150000 deaths was violent and ferocious. In my research on the two communities I found that the Hutu-Tutsi alienation had been reported by the Germans and Belgians during their colonial administrations from 1894 until 1962. Outbreaks of fighting were controlled by those colonial powers.Since independence was granted to both Rwanda and Burundi in 1962 blood baths and genocides have occurred periodically: two in Rwanda and three in Burundi.Now the whole area including Zaire is involved in bloodletting that gives the indication of turning into a holocaust.

 9,The Brooklyn Philharmonic and the Next Wave Festival joined forces over the weekend to present three concerts of a program of determinedly post-modernist European orchestral music in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House. Each score was a major effort lasting between 25 and 33 minutes. There was one post-modernist ''greatest hit'' and three premieres and it was the hit that proved the highlight of Friday evening's performance.Arvo Part the Estonian composer who now lives in West Berlin is one of several composers (among them Alfred Schnittke and Sofiya Gubaidulina) who have received the partisanship of Gidon Kremer the Soviet violinist who also now lives in the West. Mr. Part's score ''Tabula Rasa'' has won particular praise for its religio-mystical Eastern European gloss on Minimalist precepts. The means are simple but the ends are profound.Just how Mr. Part achieves this profundity compared to simple-minded imitations that use similar tactics to far lesser effect is a quandary. With busy complex scores one can avoid the issue of artistic worth by dwelling on the complexities. With Minimalism one is forced to fall back on essentials.''Tabula Rasa'' which lasted 27 minutes is in two movements scored for two solo violinists (Mr. Kremer and Tatyana Grindenko) strings and prepared piano which acts like a distant percussion battery. In the first movement the strings establish a slow restful pulse like a heartbeat and the violinists weave ethereal traceries in upper positions and harmonics. In the second movement it is the soloists who delineate the pulse punctuated by more varied string textures and a periodic effect that sounds like a distant tolling bell. The result is either restful (there were several peaceful sleepers in my immediate proximity) or consoling; I stayed awake and was consoled.

 9,Top Federal Reserve bank officials can now stay in their jobs longer.In a policy change the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System sent out letters this week to the Federal Reserve banks saying it had approved changes in the rules for the tenure of the highest officials at the 12 regional banks by adding an optional exception to rules that govern their retirement.Under the new policy if appointed after the age of 55 a Fed bank president or first vice president would be allowed to stay in the job for 10 years or until the age of 70. The president would have to retire when he or she met one of those provisions. Previously presidents had to retire at 65. The exception can be granted by the individual Federal Reserve Bank's board.''Mandatory retirement for presidents and first vice president of Federal Reserve Banks now has an optional exception'' Peter Bakstansky a spokesman for the New York Federal Reserve Bank said.The change could affect the tenures of some key Fed officials. William J. McDonough the president of the New York bank for example could stay on for an extra few years. Mr. McDonough who was named president of the New York Fed in July 1993 turns 63 next spring. Under the new regulations he could continue to head the New York Fed until July 2003 when he would have completed 10 years in the job at the age of 69.

 9,Edward F. Kook the founder and longtime president of the Century Lighting Company which brightened more than 1000 Broadway plays died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. His death at the age of 87 was caused by a heart attack a family spokesman said.Mr. Kook (pronounced cook) was a major behind-the-scenes theater figure for 40 years. He received a 1952 Tony award and the 1962 Kelcey Allen Award for long and devoted service to the theater. He founded and managed Century Lighting in Manhattan from 1929 to 1968 personally supervising the design manufacture and popularization of many innovations in lighting instruments effects and controls in theaters opera houses and television studios in the United States Canada Europe and South America. He sold the company in 1964 to the Progress Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia which renamed it the Lighting Corporation of America but he stayed on to aid the transition.George C. Izenouer a leading inventor of lighting systems worked closely with Mr. Kook for 44 years in developing increasingly sophisticated devices. He said yesterday from his home in Connecticut ''I was the inventor and engineer and he was the entrepreneur who made it all possible.''Hours Cut to SecondsA major breakthrough was their installation of the first electronic lighting control system in a professional theater in New York at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center in the mid-1960's. With the system hours of rehearsal time formerly required for recording a given lighting cut were reduced to seconds.
 0,To the Editor:In ''Matters of Emphasis'' (column April 29) Paul Krugman says he believes that we'll ''eventually find some poison gas or crude biological weapons'' in Iraq but not ''true W.M.D.'s.''Isn't ''crude biological weapon'' an oxymoron? Would the tiny amounts of anthrax that gripped us with fear be a crude biological weapon?I would agree that President Bush pushed some buttons by emphasizing certain matters as the pretext for war but while Mr. Krugman sees this as dishonest I see it simply as necessary given the circumstances.GLEN BADACHWestwood N.J.

 0,Governor Eliot Spitzer signed five executive orders in his first morning as governor of New York including orders establishing a number of ethical guidelines for state workers and making the government more open to the public.During a signing ceremony at about 8:45 a.m. at the executive mansion Mr. Spitzer said he was fulfilling a promise “that one of the first acts I would take as governor officially was to put in place a series of ethics guidelines and strictures that would begin the process of restoring government to what it should be which is responsive open transparent available to the public and to the extent feasible insulated from the influence of improper gifts and contributions.”“I am hoping that others in other branches will join me in this” he added.He signed the orders on a desk once used by Theodore Roosevelt in a room of the mansion known as “the History Room” which also includes a wheelchair used by Franklin Roosevelt. After Mr. Spitzer finished signing the orders and had answered some questions he strode out of the room but he and his wife Silda were drawn back in after his dogs Jesse (Bichon Frisé) and James (Wheaten Terrier) bolted in and began barking at members of the news media.Asked how much sleep he had gotten Mr. Spitzer said “probably not enough.”“I think I came upstairs from downstairs at about 12:30 probably went to sleep at about 1 but I will admit that about 4:30 combination of wondering what the weather was going to be this morning I started getting up to peer out the window.”Mr. Spitzer’s first executive order prohibited state workers at public agencies and authorities from accepting gifts or more than nominal value and prohibited the use of state property including vehicles computers and telephones for non-official business. And in what seemed to be a reference to the scandal that led to the resignation of former Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi the order said that individuals authorized by their agency to use a vehicle for personal purposes “shall keep records of such use and the value of such personal use shall be calculated and reported as personal income.”The same order also prohibited nepotism in hiring and contracting and barred former state workers from lobbying their former agency for two years.The second order prohibited state workers from donating money to the campaigns of the governor or lieutenant governor or affiliated political action committees.“I do not believe it looks proper for individuals who work for the governor the lieutenant governor to be making contributions” he said adding “the appearance might be that they have been expected to do so or it is a condition of employment. None of that should exist.”The order also barred employment officials from asking job candidates about their party affiliation and barred state officials from appearing in advertisements paid for by state entities a frequent practice of former Gov. George E. Pataki. The order also prohibited commissioners and executive directors of agencies and public authorities from running for public office without first resigning.In a third order the governor said all state agencies and authorities must come up with a plan to broadcast their meetings on the Internet if they are subject to the state’s Open Meetings Law.“It may be that nobody clicks through and watches but at least the possibility of watching what these boards do and how they meet and how they discuss the issues is important” Mr. Spitzer said.A fourth order established judicial screening committees to evaluate and recommend judicial candidates for a range of judgeships across the state.A fifth order which Mr. Spitzer described as “ministerial” continued a number of executive orders from the Cuomo and Pataki administrations.As his dogs bounded around the room the governor was asked if he would let them eat any of the new official paperwork.“If it’s tasty” he replied “why not?”
 0,Appropriately incensed responses came from among others the critic Alex Ross the conductor Michael Lewanski and on Facebook the composer Anthony Cheung who wrote: “In continuing to use a fixed concept of ‘canon’ to perpetuate flawed ideologies we are severely limiting and excluding the very possibility of making it a living fluid ever-evolving thing.”In sum: The idea that jazz new music and the “Western canon” can or should in 2015 be separated in a serious musical education is preposterous.Bruckner’s TooMilhaud shares a birthday with Anton Bruckner (born 1824) the great composer of vast shimmering symphonic soundscapes.When I interviewed the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter a year ago she recalled a performance of the slow second movement of Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic that was so intense she had to leave the hall.

 0,In the last 24 hours thousands of women turned to Twitter and Facebook to express their anger over the decision by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation the world’s largest breast cancer organization to halt financial support for cancer screening and education services at Planned Parenthood affiliates.Planned Parenthood as my colleague Pam Belluck reported accused Komen of bowing to pressure from anti-abortion rights activists prompting a passionate online discussion from both sides of the abortion debate as well as thousands of online messages lamenting the role of politics in women’s health care.Beyond politicians and advocates some authors including Judy Blume and celebrities including actress Dana Delaney jumped into the conversation on Twitter.On Wednesday Susan G. Komen was a top Google search term falling just below Don Cornelius the creator of “Soul Train” after news of his death was announced. It was also a top trending topic in the U.S. on Twitter. And more than 5000 people left comments on a post that Komen made on its Facebook page defending its decision which the foundation said was not made in response to pressure from opponents of abortion rights.On the Red State blog Erik Erikson applauded Komen’s decision and urged people to send a thank you note and a donation to the organization.Groups including Americans United for Life also urged people to show their support for the Komen Foundation on Facebook.While there were comments on Facebook Twitter and online message boards praising Komen an analysis by Polipulse a social media analytics tool for a Washington-based public relations firm showed that 75 percent of the people posting on social media channels about the decision were sharing negative comments about Komen’s decison while 25 percent supported it. According to the analysis more than 20 percent said that they would not give money to Komen because of the move.Some people called on their Facebook friends and Twitter followers to turn in their pink ribbons and offer financial support to Planned Parenthood instead of Susan G. Komen. An online letter was shared by more than 19000 people. By Wednesday afternoon Planned Parenthood was advertising on Twitter using promoted tweets to help raise money.Please RT: Help us make sure that women continue to get the care they need. Donate to Planned Parenthood today: bit.ly/AAlipY #komen — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) February 1 2012Raising money online alone generated $400000 by Wednesday evening in addition to a $250000 donation from a Dallas-based organization.In an article by Gardiner Harris and Pam Belluck about the Komen foundation a board member said that Planned Parenthood exploiting the news as a fund-raising opportunity.Some of the online discussion centered on Karen Handel the Komen foundation’s senior vice president for public policy since April 2011 who ran on an anti-abortion rights platform during an unsuccessful bid for governor of Georgia in 2010. The blog Jezebel found a post on Ms. Handel’s campaign blog stating that she did not support the mission of Planned Parenthood.And both organizations used social media throughout the day to communicate their position including a Komen organization in Connecticut that announced on its Facebook page its frustration with the decision to cut funds for Planned Parenthood.
 0,SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — We’ve had a fair number of tough Saturday crosswords over the last few months and today’s offering does nothing to soften the curve. Robert H. Wolfe presents us with a mix of long entries sly clues and some challenging vocabulary in a wide-open grid.The grid is one that Mr. Wolfe has used three times in the past and its unusual windmill design is more than just a tribute to the letter T. The black squares divide the puzzle into four solving quadrants composed of only 58 total answers. Only seven other Times constructors have matched or bettered that feat for a 15×15 grid.One result of this is a total lack of three-letter entries and only four four-letter entries both of which can be helpful in cracking a themeless puzzle. The other result is an extremely high number of common letters. E R S and T account for 99 out of the 190 grid letters. An additional 40 letters are either A I or N. Assuming this in advance can help when solving.The Details:Did “Early 1990s first lady’s first name” have you searching in the United States when you should have been looking to Russia and Mr. Gorbachev’s bride? I wondered about the accuracy of “A conductor may have it memorized” for BUS LINE since I’m not familiar with bus drivers being referred to as conductors but the dictionary tells me otherwise. POLLUTERS for “They’re not green” was far down the line of interpretations I considered for that clue. YTTRIA or yttrium oxide is a compound that helps put the red in television picture tubes.The toughest crossing for me was STI_ES crossing SE_TIMES. I spent a fair amount of time looking at that missing letter until I vaguely remembered the word STIPE from somewhere deep in my brain. Thank goodness because SEPTIMES wasn’t going to come with or without that S on the end of it. Those were a bit out there but I guess there’s no arguing that “Way out there” yielded the most ESOTERIC answer.A Final Thought: Mr. Wolfe practices veterinary medicine on Long Island in New York at the Wolfe Animal Hospital. He’s been married 38 years with two daughters and a granddaughter runs three miles a day and plays the piano and guitar. He also writes poetry and has written a screenplay and a novel (as yet unsold) — as well as over 2000 crossword puzzles.Notice: The crossword community has lost Dan Naddor a prolific constructor who passed away Tuesday night from cancer-related causes. More than 100 of his puzzles were published in the Los Angeles Times over the last three years. He made his New York Times debut this past August (Across Lite Solution).

 0,The apparent conflict over whether Syria does or does not back the Lebanese and Hezbollah position is more than a matter of semantics.Leaders of Hezbollah the main guerrilla movement in the south have said they will not abandon their war until Israel gives up Shabaa Farms a mountainous stretch of land at the base of Mount Hermon in the Golan Heights and releases all Lebanese held in Israeli jails.The Lebanese government which has permitted the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militia to operate freely in the south and has lauded it as a national liberation force has echoed the Hezbollah threats.But at the same time the government and Hezbollah are tightly tied to Syria which has some 30000 soldiers and an undisclosed number of intelligence agents in Lebanon. So a Syrian decision to accept Israel's withdrawal as full compliance with Resolution 425 would obligate Lebanon and the militia to follow suit.As far as the United Nations resolutions are concerned Shabaa Farms is part of the land Israel seized from Syria along with the Golan Heights. Lebanese officials have said they want all their land restored regardless of when it was occupied.United Nations officials including Mr. Roed-Larsen have said recently that the ownership of Shabaa Farms is a matter to be decided between Syria and Lebanon. The two countries have never agreed on an international border between them.Shabaa Farms is a rocky mountainous tract along Lebanon's southeastern border strategic because it overlooks the Golan Heights and also southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa region along Lebanon's border with Syria. Seven small rivers that feed into the Jordan all converge in a depression of the Shabaa Farms land.

 0,PhotoStandard & Poor’s the giant credit rating agency accused of inflating the subprime mortgage bubble had long been convinced that a Justice Department lawsuit lacked merit. So convinced in fact that it portrayed the lawsuit as an act of “retaliation” for its decision to cut the credit rating of the United States in the summer of 2011.Now that S.&P. is poised to settle that case as well as lawsuits from 19 state attorneys general across the country the rating agency is walking back that claim.As part of a $1.37 billion settlement deal expected this week S.&P. has agreed to acknowledge that it never found evidence supporting its accusations of retaliation people briefed on the matter said.The Justice Department which long scoffed at S.&P.’s claims had emphasized the retraction as a sticking point in the settlement talks. S.&P. eventually agreed the people said though its acknowledgment does not address whether additional depositions would have yielded a different conclusion.The concession — an unexpected about-face for the rating agency — will appear as one element in a broader statement of facts that S.&P. negotiated with state and federal authorities. While S.&P. agreed to many of the government’s demands the people said it managed to avoid an admission that it had committed fraud an important victory for the rating agency.As the S.&P. case winds down in the coming days closing the book on one of the government’s signature Wall Street cases other investigations stemming from the financial crisis are gaining steam.S.&P. was not the only rating agency to draw scrutiny. After more than four years of investigating the role of Moody’s S.&P.’s rival in stoking the mortgage crisis the Justice Department recently secured a breakthrough the people briefed on the matter said. It is too soon to tell however whether the recent developments will breathe enough new life into the long-running inquiry that Moody’s will face a lawsuit. The Connecticut attorney general’s office which was one of the first to sue S.&P. also filed a case against Moody’s.Some banks also remain on the government’s radar. The Justice Department which already obtained tens of billions of dollars from banks suspected of duping investors into buying troubled mortgage investments has turned its focus to Morgan Stanley one of the people briefed on the matter said. A settlement is expected in the first quarter of the year.The investigations into Wall Street misdeeds typically follow a similar path: one that results in a settlement. It is rare for a financial institution to gamble its fate in the courtroom fearing that a protracted legal battle would alienate the government and unnerve shareholders.S.&P. bucked that trend. Faced with demands that it pay more than $1 billion to settle with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general — similar to the demands that it has now accepted — it initially chose to fight instead.The Justice Department’s lawsuit filed two years ago this week accused S.&P. of fraud. Saying that S.&P. falsely claimed that its ratings “were objective independent uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest” the lawsuit argued that S.&P. actually inflated its ratings of mortgage securities to appease the Wall Street banks that had devised the investments. A conflict of interest — the banks paid S.&P. to rate the deals — “improperly influenced” the ratings criteria the Justice Department said.S.&P. a unit of McGraw Hill Financial fought back saying that its claims of objectivity were mere “puffery” akin to corporate marketing and could not be taken seriously. The rating agency which called the Justice Department’s lawsuit “meritless” and vowed to fight it “vigorously” hired at least five law firms to handle the case.The lawyers engineered a broad response to the government. Indeed in its answer to the Justice Department’s complaint S.&P. offered 19 different defenses to the charges. But one defense — that the Justice Department “commenced this action in retaliation” for the downgrade of the United States credit rating — garnered the most public attention.“Only S&P Ratings downgraded the United States and only S&P Ratings has been sued by the United States” the filing noted.S.&P. then took its claims a step further submitting an affidavit from an S.&P. executive who said that Timothy F. Geithner the Treasury secretary at the time of the downgrade had warned that S.&P.’s conduct would be “looked at very carefully.”At the time a spokeswoman for Mr. Geithner said that “the allegation that former Secretary Geithner threatened or took any action to prompt retaliatory government action against S.&P. is false.”But that did not stop S.&P. from subpoenaing Mr. Geithner. The judge overseeing the case supported the S.&P.’s request.Floyd Abrams a noted First Amendment lawyer who often represents S.&P. ultimately became the face of the retaliation defense.During an appearance on CNBC on the heels of the Justice Department’s filing of the case Mr. Abrams was the first to link the federal investigation to S.&P.’s decision in 2011 to cut the United States credit rating below the top grade of AAA.“The intensity of the investigation” he told the network “significantly increased” after the downgrade.
 9,Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that Jordan should continue to take part in any Middle East peace negotiations even though King Hussein of Jordan has given up his claims to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Mr. Shultz said the King ''has to be a partner'' in any future peace talks with Israel because ''Jordan has the longest border with Israel of any Arab state.'' So ''if there is going to be peace between Israel and its neighbors then Jordan is involved'' Mr. Shultz said. Gesture of SupportJordanian diplomats here in Washington said the King's actions were designed to prove that he accepts the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole representative of the Palestinians and did not want to compete with it in the occupied territories.Many Israelis and Palestinians who listened to the speech were left wondering whether King Hussein really wants to retain some influence on the West Bank or to give it up completely. [ Page A4. ] State Department officials said they doubted that Hussein was permanently renouncing all claims to speak for the Palestinians of the West Bank. They said his actions in the last four days could be tactical moves intended to apply pressure to the P.L.O.

 9,William K. Reilly President Bush's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency signaled a sharp break with Reagan Administration policies today by saying he would propose legislation to reduce acid rain.Answering questions at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on his nomination Mr. Reilly said the first item on his agenda was legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act. He said a major component of that legislation would be a program for reducing acid precipitation caused by pollution from coal-burning power plants and other sources.Mr. Reilly said that members of the Bush transition staff and the agency's staff had been working out details of the legislation and that the bill would be ready to go to Congress within a few weeks. He said the bill would contain a specific goal for reducing the pollution caused by acid rain a goal that he could not pinpoint because it was still being worked out by the staff. Cost of Plan Put at BillionsMr. Reilly was not asked at the hearing how much such a program would cost and he has declined to be interviewed on any subject until he is confirmed. Others have estimated however that many billions of dollars would have to be spent to achieve any significant reductions in the pollution responsible for acid rain.

 9,In July of 1933 we left Germany on a temporary visa and went to Czechoslovakia where we stayed for the summer. We then proceeded from country to country seeking admittance to the United States. It was very difficult in those days to come to the United States. It still is. That is one of the reasons why I take such an interest in the immigration bill.In 1933 we lived at first in Czechoslovakia. Then we went to Switzerland and stayed there for about a half year and then on to Holland and stayed there also about six months. At each stop my father would talk to the American consul in order to see if we could gain admittance to the United States and at each stop he was told no because of the quota systems that existed at that time.Finally when we were in England my father was able to convince the American consul that we should come under the German quota. So finally we were able to come here.My father told me that each stop he would always ask himself whether we were far enough removed from the threats that he saw even in 1933 and 1934. In 1935 even with the channel between us and Germany he felt we were not far enough removed.So yesterday was a momentous day. I called my brother and my sister and we talked about it. We talked about our luck about the greatness of the opportunity to come to the United States and what a remarkable country it was proven by the fact that someone of my background should rise to become a U.S. Senator from a state like Minnesota which is inhabited mostly by Scandinavians and Germans and certainly not by people of my background and origin.

 0,Mary DiBiase Blaich for The New York TimesChuck has been training hard for months now. He’s put on a few pounds of what might conceivably be muscle. He’s in the shape of his life.On Tuesday when the big moment comes Chuck will be ready his trainer says. He will not mess up this time.Because if Chuck bites the mayor again he and his trainer may both be finished.Irving Silverstein/Staten Island AdvanceChuck of course is the Staten Island Zoo’s resident groundhog whose annual photo op turned into a YouTube moment last year when he took a chunk out of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s leather glove and index finger.Chuck’s trainer Douglas Schwartz still maintains that the mayor brought the attack on himself. Chuck was in one of his moods last year and he did not want to come out of his wooden cage so the mayor impatiently grabbed him by the belly. Chomp.This year Mr. Schwartz said Monday “the rule is that nobody else will try to pick him up first — usually I try to pick him up.”But in the heat of the moment the mayor can no more easily be controlled than can a 15-pound 4-year-old groundhog. And if Mr. Schwartz has learned anything in his 13-plus years as a city employee it is that the boss is always right. He is ready for any eventuality.“When it’s the mayor he’s the center of attention” he said. “You can’t be giving the mayor orders.”That Chuck is being given a second chance at all is a bit of a surprise. Last year the zoo’s executive director John J. Caltabiano said that the zoo was casting for a replacement. But Chuck is back and Mr. Schwartz said had faith in his charge.“I’ve really been spending a lot of time with him -– hands-on in a real sense” he said. Once again he offered his word as a showbiz veteran. “He is a professional and I’m a professional.”
 0,A court ruling last week in Nebraska has dealt a devastating blow to the nation's program for policing meat safety. It calls into question the government's authority to shut down meat plants for repeatedly violating sanitary standards designed to combat bacterial contamination and outbreaks of food-borne illness.Judge Joseph Bataillon of the Federal District Court rebuffed an Agriculture Department effort to shut down the operations of Nebraska Beef an Omaha slaughterhouse with numerous citations for violating standard sanitary operating procedures. The plant was chosen for special scrutiny after the discovery last year of deadly E. coli bacteria in ground beef produced by a Nebraska Beef customer. In granting a temporary restraining ordering blocking the closure the judge elevated the economic interests of a local employer over public health while questioning the government's power to act under current law.All this has a familiar ring. Just two years ago in a different case a federal appeals court in New Orleans declared that the Agriculture Department lacked the power to close a Dallas beef processing plant that had failed three rounds of tests for Salmonella contamination in a year. Unfortunately Congress and the Bush administration failed to heed the message of that misguided decision by passing a law that reaffirms the government's authority to enforce health standards.Reacting to the new ruling the Agriculture Department has decided to reach a settlement with the meat packer that allows the plant to continue to operate. It is hard to fault the department's lawyers for wanting to avoid a drawn-out court fight likely to result in an adverse final decision by the judge. But even now Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman refuses to acknowledge the grievous damage inflicted on her department's food safety efforts by the courts' suggestion that the government has no authority to close a plant based on public health considerations. She still hesitates to get behind legislation sponsored by Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Richard Durbin of Illinois Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and others that would close this and other gaping holes in the nation's food safety system. That is inexcusable.

 0,CHARLESTON S.C. – The most famous face in the city at the moment is that of the composer Philip Glass. You see him in miniature and writ huge on a 38-by-26 foot banner at the Gailliard Auditorium. You see him on posters in store windows and restaurants. You see him walking toward you on the street on the front of a T-shirt and as likely as not the wearer is carrying a program book for the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. with – who else? – Philip Glass on the cover.And he is not even here yet. Beginning on Wednesday Mr. Glass will present the American premiere of his “Book of Longing” which has its world premiere tonight in Toronto. A theater piece it is based on music and images by Leonard Cohen.But the image in question here is the acclaimed “Large Phil Fingerprint/Random” (1979) by Chuck Close. Festival logos in recent years have tended to be more abstract but this one is concrete and insistent. And not everyone is happy about it to judge from comments at a private party last night or even knows who it is.The Charleston Post and Courier reports that it did a quick survey on the street last week and none of the 21 passersby queried knew who it was. One woman thought it looked like Rocky Balboa. And you know there is a little resemblance. It would explain at least the swollen-looking lips.

 0,WASHINGTON — Thousands of immigrants with criminal convictions including for assault and attempted murder have been released from detention because their native countries refused to take them back according to statistics recently released by the Department of Homeland Security.The inability to deport the criminals has prompted outrage among lawmakers and advocates of tighter immigration laws who say that the Obama administration could be doing much more to pressure uncooperative countries.But the department faces a number of obstacles. It is legally barred from indefinitely detaining immigrants who cannot be repatriated. And poorer nations are often reluctant to take back violent offenders because they have limited resources to deal with them.The release of such immigrants into American cities is a particularly charged aspect of the national debate over immigration. Donald J. Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has painted a grim picture of immigrant criminals menacing the streets.

 9,Responding to Russian complaints of rude treatment by consular officers at the American Embassy here Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said today that he had taken steps to improve the visa application process.Mr. Pickering said he had brought in specialists to monitor the "comportment and deportment" of officers as they conducted interviews as well as Russian-language experts to study their "use of language."Mr. Pickering said the embassy had introduced an express line for some applicants to speed the process and to make it less stressful. In an experiment a handful of accredited tourist agencies will be allowed to apply for visas for their business travelers he added.To underwrite some of the costs of a new computer system for issuing and checking visas the State Department has begun charging Russians a $20 fee for each application effective today. Up to now the visas had been free. A single-entry visa now costs $20 while a multi-entry visa costs $120.
 9,The other statistics pointed down led by a decrease in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods. That was followed by a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders fewer orders for plants and equipment fewer building permits and higher initial unemployment claims. Two other negative factors were faster vendor performance meaning declining demand and lower prices for sensitive materials which indicated weakening demand. Index at 145% of BaseThe various changes left the index at 145 percent of its 1982 base of 100. So far this year the index has fallen at an annual rate of one-tenth of a percent compared with an increase of 3.8 percent for the first nine months of 1988.The economy has been slowing since the Federal Reserve Board acted last year stem inflation. But while inflation appears to be abating the analysts said they were concerned that the Fed's grip could spur a recession.Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch and other economists pointed to excessive inventories and slackening orders for durable goods including less demand for new automobiles as primary threats to the economy because both could lead to growing unemployment and stagnant growth. Trade Deficit ConcernsThe economists are also concerned about the nation's trade deficit which increased in August after falling for two straight months and declining corporate profits which could affect stock market prices.Mr. Steinberg and Lawrence Chimerine the senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group Inc. an economic forecasting group in Bala-Cynwyd Pa. noted that the consumer confidence category was the primary positive indicator in the September index.Consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity accounted for much of this year's growth so far.

 0,TOKYO — Kim Jong-un North Korea’s leader said Tuesday that he was willing to have a second summit meeting with President Trump but he paired the offer with a threat that if international sanctions against his country were not lifted the North would “have no choice” but to return to nuclear confrontation.“I am willing to meet the United States president at any time for the betterment of our international community” Mr. Kim said in his New Year’s Day speech broadcast on North Korea’s state-run television. “However if the United States does not keep its promise in our international community and misinterprets our patience and intention and continues with the sanctions then we have no choice for the sake of our national interest and peace of the Korean Peninsula but to come up with new initiatives and new measures.”Wearing a suit and tie and sitting in an overstuffed leather armchair in a book-lined room Mr. Kim offered a largely motivational speech about the need to strengthen the North Korean economy. But he took the opportunity to reiterate a demand that South Korea cease all military drills with “other foreign sources.”“Those should be completely stopped” Mr. Kim said. “That is our stance.”There were sparse direct references in the speech to denuclearization. But Mr. Kim said the country would not be willing to take further steps toward removing its nuclear weapons unless the United States reciprocated.
 0,"They are a mystery" he said. "We have shown them to a lot of people to identify the sculptor without success. The use of lead points to a Northern European origin. The marble would seem to indicate Italy. It's likely a meeting of different schools. They may have been done by Italian sculptors working in Paris."Until now the blackamoors stood on the landing of the grand staircase of the palatial Lisbon town house of Antonio de Sommer Champalimaud a Portuguese businessman and banker. "Part of the excitement of the sale is that people have never been to the house; no one knew what was there" Mr. Rock said. "He rebuilt an entire house behind an old facade right in the middle of Lisbon on top of a hill."Before the Portuguese revolution of 1974 Champalimaud owned cement factories iron mills and steel works in Portugal and was a major shareholder in Banco Pinto & Sottomayor. In 1974 the government nationalized his companies and he suffered huge losses. He moved to Brazil and started a cement industry there.In the 1990's he returned to Portugal and systematically bought back his former companies one by one. He died last year at 86 leaving a $3 billion fortune. He left $908 million and his art collections to the Champalimaud Foundation for medical research in Portugal which he had founded. The sale expected to raise $25 million to $36 million has more than 200 lots of signed French furniture antique boiseries porcelain bronzes and oil paintings (including a large Canaletto painting of Venice that is expected to go for £5 million).One of the great attractions of the sale is a complete room of beautifully carved antique boiseries painted pale gray. Champalimaud hired Jansen the prestigious Paris decorating firm to design his Lisbon house and presumably it was Jansen that acquired this set of Louis XVI carved oak panels made in about 1775. The most important pieces have bas-reliefs representing four continents: an alligator symbolizing America; a lion Africa; a stallion Europe; and the camel Asia.

 0,Noah Berger/Bloomberg NewsAs investors fret that Google’s $6 billion bid for Groupon is too high a price to pay new details about the company’s sales and growth suggest that it might be more like one of Groupon’s cut-rate deals.An individual close to Groupon who spoke on condition of anonymity said the company’s annual revenue is running in excess of $1 billion a year and its subscriber base tripled this summer to 35 million users.And an analyst at Barclays Capital Douglas Anmuth estimated in a research report released on Tuesday that sales could hit $1.5 billion in 2011.At those levels Google would be paying four times next year’s revenues. In contrast the company paid $3.1 billion or roughly 10 times sales for DoubleClick in 2007. It bought YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006 when the online video hub was making less than $11 million a year according to a company filing.Also this week Groupon disclosed new features including a three-tiered pricing system that would fundamentally change its business model and accelerate growth focusing on local markets although most likely at the expense of margins.Groupon’s founder Andrew Mason is unconcerned. His strategy he said in an interview by phone on Wednesday is “finding the holy grail of local.”“Since the days of CompuServe everyone was thinking how the Internet will transform the way local business is done” said Mr. Mason. “I think we’re well positioned.”Stock in Google rose about 1.5 percent on Wednesday regaining a portion of the 4.5 percent decline on Tuesday the day after the bid was reported.Since its start in 2008 Groupon has focused on offering only a limited number of coupons a day. According to Mr. Mason the company passes on seven deals for each one it selects adding that Groupon fields 1000 requests a day from vendors.That backlog has spawned scores of imitators scavenging for Groupon’s castoffs. In the last year LivingSocial Gilt City and BuyWithMe have begun operating in the local advertising space.Now Groupon is changing its model in response to competition and critics who say deals are too few and the cost is too high. The standard commission rate is 50 percent. For that price a vendor’s coupon becomes the featured deal of the day in a certain city.Under a new pilot program in Chicago Dallas and Seattle Groupon will let vendors set up free microsites called Groupon Stores to promote their deals. Local offers tailored to users’ interests are also aggregated on the “Deal Feed” page.Vendors can then opt to offer a deal with a 10 30 or 50 percent commission. The higher the commission the more consumers the coupon can potentially reach. At the 10 percent level vendors can offer deals on their microsite as well as push them to past consumers and current followers.Groupon plans eventually to introduce the program across its 300 markets.“This is about a whole new wave in advertising displacement. Groupon will have more reach to more merchants in more cities” said Ira D. Cohen managing director of Signal Hill a boutique investment bank. “The new features may take a bit away from the uniqueness and excitement of the one deal a day model but this is probably a very good thing for Groupon.”As a fledgling directory of local stores Groupon may be a good complement to Google Places where businesses can create their own page. Some analysts say it may also become a closer rival of Yelp a review site that Google tried to acquire last year.Planned features on Groupon will expand the social networking element to the site. Soon users will be able to send alerts on new deals trade coupons they bought or share recent purchases. The social networking aspects are important said Allen P. Adamson managing director of the New York office of Landor Associates a brand marketing firm helping to create stronger bonds between consumers and vendors.“There’s an opportunity for someone to transform the way people buy from local businesses in the same way that e-commerce has changed the way people buy products” Mr. Mason said.

 9,We're lucky. We have a house in the country. The house is in Massachusetts 137.6 miles from our apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan - if we take the Taconic State Parkway north and then Route 23 east. If we take the Saw Mill River Parkway and Interstate 684 and Route 22 turning off at Wassaic and proceeding through Sharon Conn. and Mill River Mass. then the whole trip is 114.7 miles. Sometimes we take the Taconic Parkway only as far north as Route 44 and travel east from there through Millbrook and then Sharon etc. 121.6 miles. There are other routes that we sometimes take and I know the mileage for all of them as well as I know the first symptoms of car-seat fatigue from my 1-year-old daughter and from my son the question ''Are we almost there?'' which he begins to ask 8.4 miles into the northbound journey (in Yonkers that is) and 6.3 into the southbound leg.For you see I have made this same trip thousands of times. I have been making it for more than 40 years. (I remember the Hawthorne Circle. I remember when you could buy fireworks in Connecticut; I remember when big long cars squeezed past each other on the Taconic. I remember when you could take the train!) Getting there has become - for me - so much less than half the fun that I would need to resort to a negative fraction to express it mathematically. The tedium which grew exquisite almost ecstatic more than a decade ago has now been whatever the opposite of ''leavened'' is by the otherwise joyful addition of our two young children who naturally lack the repressive power that adults have and consequently do what I would in my heart of hearts like to do for a large part of the trip - whine cry eat and (if we're in luck) fall asleep.When and if the kids do take naps simultaneously my wife and I try to have some adult conversation. ''After all it's really one of the few chances we get'' we say to each other. Here's how it goes:ME: So what's on your mind?WIFE: I've been trying to figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life.ME: And what have you come up with?WIFE: I've been thinking of taking up a new line of work. The trouble is nothing else really appeals to me. Silence for .4 miles. ME: You know I've been sort of wondering what I'm going to do with myself too. WIFE: And? ME: Well maybe I could go into a different profession. But then I have to remember that I like my job pretty well. WIFE: I know what you mean. Silence for 1.6 miles. ME: We could sell the house and buy another one that's a little more um convenient. WIFE: That's an idea. ME: But we won't. WIFE: No we won't. ME: We couldn't sell it. WIFE: No we couldn't. Silence for 2.8 miles.
 9,Last weekend Ms. Brotman sat with her 7-year-old daughter Sylvannah on a white leather sofa in her father's den and -- between phone calls and cigarettes -- tried to grapple with her losses and plan her return to Liberia which she said was her only home.Ms. Brotman left Bennington College in 1968 to take a secretarial position with the New York Blood Center's research laboratory on East 67th Street. But her desk job did not last long. Described as "a brilliant woman and superb manager" by her longtime supervisor Dr. Alfred M. Prince Ms. Brotman was dispatched to West Africa in 1971 to try to collect blood samples from wild chimpanzees then to investigate whether hepatitis B was being transmitted by such blood-sucking insects as bed bugs.For the insect study she visited the rooms of prostitutes in the Ivory Coast spraying pesticides to collect samples. With vermin exterminated "the prostitutes were very appreciative" Ms. Brotman said.In 1974 Ms. Brotman moved to Liberia to assemble a colony of chimpanzees for hepatitis studies and vaccine tests. Chimpanzees are well suited for such work because they can carry human hepatitis viruses Ms. Brotman said but unlike their human relations do not develop serious illness.Liberia was ideal said Dr. Prince a senior researcher at the Blood Center because it was part of the chimpanzee's home range. At the jungle compound the chimps live in spacious outdoor cages Ms. Brotman said instead of cramped in small cages inside sealed buildings as they are in primate centers here.Ms. Brotman who moved to Liberia with a daughter from a prior marriage said she thrived on the "challenge of living in a difficult place." Soon after settling in she adopted the first of four African girls. In 1986 Ms. Brotman married a British engineer Brian Garnham who went to work at the compound.Scientists at the compound 40 miles outside of Monrovia made substantial progress in the fight against viral hepatitis. A vaccine for hepatitis B was developed and tested and methods for eliminating viruses from blood also were refined there Dr. Prince said. In addition the work has helped unravel the puzzle of hepatitis C which afflicts some four million Americans and millions more overseas he said. The laboratory also worked on a possible vaccine against the parasite that causes river blindness an ailment affecting some 17 million Africans.

 9,Nevertheless he said this re cent “short lag” between the marked reduction in the rate of monetary expansion and slower economic growth has made him “confident that an ef fective basis has been laid for an ultimate deceleration of price increases.”Over the near future the money supply should be in creased at a rate of 3 per cent Mr. Francis contended. He de scribed this rate as moderate by historical standards and about in line with the rate from 1961 to 1964 when the economy was in a noninflation ary recovery.Further ResearchBrake on OutputWith a 3 per cent rate of increase the economy would go through a “mild recession” this year with a decrease in output of approximately 1 per cent the central banker pre dicted.At the end of 1970 unem ployment would be about per cent he said. The price level would be rising only a little more slowly than in re cent quarters but the stage would be set for a “substan tial improvement” in the be havior of prices in 1971 and 1972.If the money supply is not allowed to grow at all Mr. Francis warned there would be “a substantial recession of at least the magnitude of the one we had in 1960–61.” Real out put would decline at about a 3 per cent annual rate and un employment would rise to about 6 per cent by the end of the year he said.By End of the YearUnder this circumstance prices would be rising at an annual rate about one percen tage point less than the increase in the first three quarters of 1969 he calculated.If on the other hand the money supply were to be in creased at a 6 per cent rate—a rate approaching the “exces sive” growth of 1967 and 1968 —the economy would have been brought to the border of a re cession without making any significant headway in the fight against inflation the central banker reasoned.

 9,Then came the Italian-style wines. Barbera had been around for generations. It was a workaday grape producing workaday wine. Then suddenly sangiovese the Chianti grape was chic. Everyone planted it. The Robert Mondavi Winery came out with a line of Italian-style wines with new labels and oddly shaped bottles.Merlot is still the trendy grape for most consumers but its star could be waning. Zinfandel may steal its spotlight. Once zinfandel was a coarse blending grape. Then it was an inexpensive varietal. Then for a decade much of it was diverted into white zinfandel a sweetish wine that also seems to have run its course.For a long time zinfandel was called America's mystery grape. For years it was thought to have come from Italy. Last year it was traced to Croatia. This year maybe we'll be told how it got there.This will also be a year for pinot noir. The delicate grape of Burgundy at the other end of the refinement scale from zinfandel has been growing in popularity in a befittingly genteel way. And wineries like Napa Ridge in California and the King Estate in Oregon have figured out how to make good pinot noir at reasonable prices.This could also be the year for oddballs. Guenoc a winery in Lake County north of Napa County Calif. is making a wine from petit verdot an old variety that turns up in minute quantities in good Bordeaux.Shooting Star a second label for Steele Wines also in Lake County offers something called Blue Franc which is made from the lemberger grape grown in Washington State.And there is a new label from Chile Veramonte which features a wine made from something called primus merlot. This we are told is actually another Bordeaux antique called carmenere. Apparently the vine was shipped to Chile in the 1800's along with some merlot and for years the two were considered to be the same vine. They are not says Veramonte.

 0,Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist surveyed the state of the federal judiciary today and in contrast to many of his 13 previous year-end reports pronounced himself quite pleased.The chief justice noted progress in three areas he had identified as problems in his report a year ago. At that time all seven seats on the United States Sentencing Commission were vacant because of a political impasse between the White House and Congress. Now the seats have been filled as a result of a compromise.Last year Congress had provided neither a raise nor a cost-of-living adjustment for federal judges. This fall Congress approved a 3.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment taking effect on Jan. 1 that will bring the annual salaries of federal district judges to $141300; of judges on the courts of appeals to $149900; of Supreme Court associate justices to $173600; and of the chief justice to $181400.The judiciary was ''appreciative'' Chief Justice Rehnquist said today ''but it should not be confused with a raise in salary.''

 9,He is a mayor who likes golf rather than tennis and he is so good at it that he earns a decent living hitting fairways and making putts. He is also the only player on the Senior PGA Tour with two putters in his bag among the 14 clubs allowed.Mayor Rocky Thompson of Toco Tex. (pop. 138) used both putters so effectively today in the opening round of the $400000 Nynex Commemorative at Sleepy Hollow Country Club that he shot his best round of the year a six-under-par 64 on the 6545-yard course.With greens overly receptive because of heavy rain during the night and again this afternoon during a 1-hour-45-minute interruption of play low scores were the norm among the 78 players in the event. But the scores of Thompson and Bob Charles were the lowest. Five Are a Shot BackBob Betley; Billy Casper who eagled the par-5 15th; Bruce Crampton; Chi Chi Rodriguez and Walt Zembriski were one shot back of the co-leaders at 65.
 0,Played six days before the SEC and Big 12 meet in the national championship the Cotton Bowl may give fans a glimpse of what lies in store for Florida and Oklahoma. On one side we have Ole Miss — the only team to beat Florida during the regular season. On the other high-flying Texas Tech’s offensive philosophy provides a similar picture to Oklahoma though more skewed towards the passing game. The same questions exist here as do in the B.C.S. national championship game: Can Texas Tech control the Ole Miss front seven? Can the Ole Miss secondary contain Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree? And like the national title game the Cotton Bowl is expected to be a good one.The Cotton Bowl: Friday Jan. 2 at 2 p.m. in DallasMississippiWhat a difference a year makes for the Rebels who ended last season on the lowest of low notes (blowing a 14-0 lead in the Egg Bowl). What a difference a new coach makes as well. Houston Nutt has reversed the losing trend developed under Ed Orgeron who led the Rebels to only 10 wins over three seasons. Few bowl teams finished the regular season hotter than Ole Miss which won its final five games to finish 8-4 its best record since the Eli Manning-led 2003 team went 10-3. The Rebels’ quarterback is the Texas transfer Jevan Snead who was terrific in his first year as the starter. He threw 15 touchdowns against only 2 interceptions during Mississippi’s five-game win streak. End Greg Hardy and tackle Peria Jerry combine to give Ole Miss one of the most formidable defensive lines in the country.Texas TechBecause of the hullabaloo about who was left out of the title game you tend to forget about the teams who were left out of the B.C.S. entirely. Texas Tech along with Boise State is a team with a genuine B.C.S. resume (a 39-33 win over then-No. 1 Texas for starters) which found itself on the outside looking in. The Red Raiders are the only one-loss team from a B.C.S. conference left out. Of course the reason Tech is in the Cotton Bowl and not say the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl was the 65-21 trouncing dropped on it by Oklahoma which did irreparable damage to its national standing. Word of the wise to the Red Raiders: Sleep on this game don’t come to play and Ole Miss will be only too happy to take full advantage. Thinking outside the box keep an eye on (if you can find him) the diminutive receiver Eric Morris who finished second on the team with eight receiving touchdowns. Morris makes Wes Welker another undersized Tech receiver look like Randy Moss.Mississippi Bowl HistoryRecord: 19-12Last appearance: 2004 Cotton Bowl vs. Oklahoma State (W 31-28)Texas Tech Bowl HistoryRecord: 10-20-1Last appearance: 2008 Gator Bowl vs. Virginia (W 31-28)Cotton Bowl HistoryFirst played in 1937Last year: Missouri 38 Arkansas 7Bowl Pick ‘EmPete: Mississippi. Will this game offer any clues to how Florida will do against Oklahoma?Thayer: Texas Tech. New question that Rebels Coach Houston Nutt can ask his team next season: “How many have won a bowl game before?”Paul: Texas Tech. But the Ole Miss front four is going to give Tech fits.Fred: Texas Tech. Love the Red Raiders and love Mike Leach. This is one of the more intriguing non-B.C.S. bowl games. I just think Texas Tech has too much offense.Connor: Texas Tech. Ole Miss is headed on the right track with Houston Nutt but Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree make the Red Raiders too explosive.

 9,When Brian Friesen was driving to work last Monday in the Vancouver British Columbia suburb of New Westminster a radio news report quickened his pulse. In trading in Toronto the Canadian dollar had reversed its steep climb of the previous months against the United States currency and tumbled nearly a full United States cent in value its sharpest one-day move in months.''I was pleased as Punch'' said Mr. Friesen the 38-year-old vice president and chief financial officer of Lamford Forest Products Ltd. a manufacturer of cedar siding and paneling that exports 70 percent of its products to the United States. Because Lamford sets United States dollar prices on the $3 million of products that it sells each month in the United States an upward movement in the Canadian dollar means losses for the company in Canadian dollars the currency in which it reckons its revenues and profits.So far this year the Canadian currency has been moving against the trend in the currency markets strengthening sharply against the United States dollar at a time when other currencies including the Japanese yen have been trading in a narrow range with the United States currency or as with the West German mark losing slightly. It is a performance that has alternately pleased and worried Canadians who have become accustomed in recent years to their dollar trading at a discount of as much as 30 United States cents to the United States currency. A 7% Increase This YearAt the close of trading in Toronto on Friday the Canadian dollar was quoted by the Bank of Canada at 82.56 United States cents an increase of nearly 6 cents or 7 percent since the beginning of the year.

 0,What we’re reading (and watching) on Wednesday morning.Gimme a head with hair: In today’s New York Times Ben Brantley assesses the long long long-in-the-works Broadway transfer of “Hair” whose seeds were sown in a 2007 concert performance and a 2008 production at the Delacorte Theater writing that the latest cast is “tearing down the house in the production that opened on Tuesday night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater. And any theatergoer with a pulse will find it hard to resist their invitation to join the demolition crew. This emotionally rich revival of ‘The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical’ from 1967 delivers what Broadway otherwise hasn’t felt this season: the intense unadulterated joy and anguish of that bi-polar state called youth.” Writing for Bloomberg News Jeremy Gerard says of the “Hair” revival that “for all its references to hippies Vietnam free love and the revolution feels utterly of the moment in its exuberance its power to involve and in Diane Paulus’s entrancing production to move us.” But in the Boston Globe Louise Kennedy writes that the show “has not to put it mildly aged well. What may once have seemed winningly ingenuous and gently rebellious now feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib. The antiwar sentiments of the show are still painfully relevant but uselessly one-dimensional and beyond that there’s . . . what? Drug jokes sex jokes squares-vs.-hippie jokes and a lot of other stuff that must have sounded a little corny even the first time around.”In a global recession do moviegoers want films about the joys or the horrors of unfettered capitalism? Even Hollywood isn’t sure: Variety reports that a new film version of Jay McInerney’s novel “Bright Lights Big City” about a disillusioned writer in class-conscious New York is in the works to be directed by Josh Schwartz the creator of “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” Meanwhile The Hollywood Reporter says that Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” will also be made into a movie. Angelina Jolie Charlize Theron Julia Roberts and Anne Hathaway are among the actors on the short list to play the fictional railroad executive Dagny Taggart.Our favorite headline announcing the US Postal Service’s decision to issue stamps based on “The Simpsons” comes from BBC News: “Millions of Americans urged to lick Homer Simpson.” Not only is it a bizarre image but most American stamps are now self-adhesive.Anticipating Conan O’Brien’s summer transition to the “Tonight” show when he’ll be rejoined by his longtime second banana Andy Richter Slate’s Troy Patterson declares Mr. Richter “the best late-night-show sidekick of all time” writing: “Too square to be hip too well-kempt for slob comedy and too principled to pander Richter exudes a normalness that renders him a misfit. But though as wholesome as Garrison Keillor on the surface he is as weird as anybody. In the moments that require his zaniest self he suggests a subtle Chris Farley with the crucial difference of seeming to prefer malted milkshakes to speedballs.”And since we suspect we won’t have it to kick around for much longer here’s a highlight reel from the new Fox variety show “Osbournes: Reloaded” which had its 25-minute premiere after “American Idol” on Tuesday night:
 0,My parents’ shared premium on education bonded them as graduate students at the University of Southern California in the 1990s. Two New Yorkers pursuing their master’s and doctorates they saw school as the surest way to attain security. It was never a question that I was going to college. Hard work I was taught would ensure as many choices as possible.That level of pressure was the norm in Montgomery County Md. just outside Washington D.C. where I grew up. It is one of the wealthiest and best-educated counties in the country. It is also largely segregated and fiercely competitive. I grew up surrounded by so much privilege it was possible for many residents to ignore race and class inequality entirely. After all the nation’s first black president lived 12 miles away. So despite the racial violence that was making headlines my friends seemed to believe Montgomery County was post-racial.“It’s sad but it’s a good thing we don’t have those problems here” a classmate said the day after Trayvon Martin was murdered. It was clear to me but not to many of my peers that the community was still very much influenced by stereotypes and misconceptions about race. When I tried to talk to my classmates about that they tended to be defensive.Being one of the few black kids in my school was all I’d ever known before college. Having my hair teasingly prodded during recess or being called “oreo” felt normal. From 7 a.m. until 4 p.m. I learned to excuse small indignities and I used humor as a defense mechanism. When I got home I could finally vent to the few other people who understood. My mother was very clear: “Don’t let anyone touch your hair and you better not let them call you outside of your name.”As I got older I felt less and less like I belonged. When I started taking AP courses and showing up to the same college info sessions as many of my classmates they made jokes about quotas and affirmative action as if they hadn’t seen me studying right alongside them for years. One classmate even asked me to give up my spot on the morning announcements because “I didn’t need anything extra” for my college applications anyway.

 9,A few weeks later since fishing is her passion and my mother's friend is no fisherman I searched out the bamboo poles from the depths of the woodshed. We spent an hour sanding rust from the old hooks. ''Every time we fished we had to sand every single one clean'' she said. ''Father would never throw a one of them away.''We stashed the bank poles in the trunk and drove to the river where everything's feeding on whatever's in reach: dragonflies mosquitoes water snakes on top bass catfish crappie in the sinkholes and stalking the mussel beds the great blue herons. Mother cocked her head listening. '' 'Can't catch when the locusts grind' is what father always said.'' But we did: The next morning a single pole bobbed and dipped a nice blue channel cat. Back home she pried the hook free studied it a moment then tossed it in the garbage.Should I dwell on her strength - plunging a butcher knife into the channel cat's steel-gray head - or her need - angry and red-faced at her impotence before the medical bureaucracy? Anyone who's not dealt with health-care systems for the elderly is in for an education. I know what we wanted to hear myself and my scattered brothers and sisters: she's doing fine she loves our visits but doesn't need our help she has her bridge club bowling golf reading volunteer work the church friends. Over long-distance lines in letters she tells us this and we believe her.But a summer is a long time to keep up an illusion and one Monday morning after I'd been gone for the weekend she dropped her guard. ''It's Sunday afternoons that get to you'' she said. ''There's nobody to call nothing on television a million things you can't bring yourself to do. Sometimes I just get in the car and drive.'' Then she stood abruptly and disappeared to reappear a half-hour later waving a wrench: ''I fixed the toilet'' she said. I checked it out: the leak was gone.I was in Kentucky for only three months but things move fast in California - out of sight out of mind. To listen to my friends I might have been leaving for Beulah Land. Three months in Kentucky? Drop a line my San Francisco friends said and I could have cut their skepticism with a knife. Let us know how it goes they said we're thinking of doing the same for our folks.
 9,For many gardeners late July and early August are the time for nursery hunting. Heat and prolonged drought in much of the Northeast bring a lull in the garden. Fall looms ahead with the cool nights and soft rains that make it the best time to plant new perennials. Plants will have a few months to establish vigorous root systems to get them through winter ready to flourish next spring.Nursery hunting a rewarding sport is a game that falls into three rough categories. There are the purely local nurseries often very good. Treasures are more likely to be found in those nurseries with national reputations which put out lists or catalogues but do not sell by mail order. Excellent examples of such nurseries are Hillside in Norfolk Conn. Weston in Hopkinton Mass. and Wells-Medina outside Seattle.I have special affection however for those nurseries that deal mainly in mail orders but are open to the public maintain display gardens and sell plants in containers. And I am naturally most interested in those from which I have ordered perennials.Heronswood Nursery in Kingston Wash. the Andre Viette Farm and Nursery in Fishersville Va. and White Flower Farm in Litchfield Conn. are a few of the many I have visited at this time of year. The visits always lift my spirits and renew my enthusiasm for gardening in this the most disheartening period of the horticultural year. My car always looks like a greenhouse when I get home.

Trump has been ruffling feathers with Hispanics with his tough talk on immigration but on Tuesday the Republican presidential candidate took a step to try to smooth things over.Mr. Trump invited Javier Palomarez president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to his Manhattan office for a meeting to clear the air. Each were joined by two staff members for a 90-minute meeting that Mr. Palomarez described as surprisingly cordial and productive.“He was very mannerly very hospitable and never once did he interrupt me” Mr. Palomarez said noting that Mr. Trump listened more than he talked during the meeting.Mr. Trump declined to comment but his spokeswoman acknowledged that the meeting took place.Mr. Palomarez said that he had expressed his disapproval with Mr. Trump’s plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico and to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. He also explained to Mr. Trump that such moves would severely cost the construction and hospitality industries which rely on the labor of immigrants.Mr. Trump politely disagreed Mr. Palomarez said and made the case that undocumented workers were imposing significant costs on the United States economy.While Mr. Palomarez said he was not endorsing Mr. Trump he did express “shock” at how friendly the conversation was and and said he was impressed with the candidate.“He was not combative he was not rude” Mr. Palomarez said. “He was a complete gentleman.”Despite the warmer feelings differences remain.Mr. Palomarez said that when he and Mr. Trump discussed the idea of the chamber holding its convention in Miami next year Mr. Trump suggested that it be held at the Trump National Doral Resort there. Given Mr. Trump’s recent tone toward Hispanics Mr. Palomarez said such a choice was unlikely.

 0,The chairman of the city's Campaign Finance Board yesterday criticized Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to sharply curtail campaign contributions from people who do business with the city.In his first public comments on the issue the board chairman Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr. testified against the proposed legislation at a City Council hearing saying that while he supported its larger goal he felt it was "the wrong way" to deal with the problem.The mayor's plan would limit contributions from such sources to $250 for candidates who receive public money from the campaign finance program. The current limits are $2750 in races for the Council $3850 for borough president and $4950 for mayor comptroller and public advocate. The plan would also eliminate matching public money for contributions from those sources.Mr. Schwarz said yesterday that the ban should apply to all candidates and not just those in the voluntary campaign finance program. "It's a citywide problem and it ought to apply to everyone running for office" he said.

 0,The Football Scientist KC Joyner contributes weekly to The Fifth Down. His latest book is “Blindsided: Why the Left Tackle is Overrated and Other Contrarian Football Thoughts.”I often say that I review players with both a metric eye (meaning via statistical analysis) and a scouting eye (meaning via traditional tape analysis). At no position is this statement truer than at quarterback. With that thought in mind here is my take on the question of which quarterback I would pick to guide my team for the next 10 years: Eli Manning or Tony Romo.I’ll start with the metric overview. There are three main metrics I use for gauging quarterback play: yards per attempt (YPA) success percentage and bad decision percentage. I use these in place of the official passer rating system because that method tends to reward dink and dunk quarterbacks and punish gunslingers. In this series of measurements each type of quarterback will have his individual strengths and weaknesses displayed and as such I think it makes for a more detailed granular form of analysis.Yards Per AttemptI use four route depth levels when tracking YPA. They are: short (1-10 yards) medium (11-19 yards) deep (20-29 yards) and bomb (30+ yards). Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 totals through week 8:ManningRoute Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 139 100 823 4 1 3 18 5.9 Medium 48 24 411 2 1 4 20 8.3 Deep 19 8 217 1 1 1 5 11.1 Bomb 13 3 106 2 1 1 31 9.8 Other 10 1 31 0 0 0 0 3.1 Total 229 136 1588 9 4 9 74 7.0RomoRoute Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 132 98 923 6 1 2 9 7.0 Medium 35 19 374 4 3 0 0 10.7 Deep 14 4 108 1 1 1 -10 6.5 Bomb 10 5 264 3 0 0 0 26.4 Other 11 0 0 0 0 1 5 0.4 Total 202 126 1669 14 5 4 4 8.1Romo has been better this year on short passes by just over a yard and he was better in 2007 by a similar amount. Romo also has a lead in two of the three vertical routes (i.e. medium deep and bomb) and his combined YPA on vertical passes is also much higher (10.3 to 8.6).This doesn’t look like a one-year anomaly either as Romo’s 2007 vertical YPA was appreciably better than Manning’s (12.2 to 8.8) although to be fair some of the metric difference in 2007 probably had to do with Plaxico Burress’ injury. Even with that caveat I still have to give the overall YPA edge to Romo.Success PercentageSuccess percentage is determined by adding the number of completions and defensive passing penalties (i.e. any penalties that happen while the pass is in the air such as pass interference illegal contact etc.) and dividing that total by the total number of attempts. The total number of attempts includes both the defensive and offensive pass penalties (e.g. offensive pass interference). Other passes are balls that either don’t make it past the line of scrimmage (e.g. pass knocked down at line) or are throwaway tosses.Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 success percentage totals by route depth:ManningRoute Depth Success % Short 74.1% Medium 56.3% Deep 47.4% Bomb 30.8% Other 10.0% Total 62.9%RomoRoute Depth Success % Short 75.8% Medium 54.3% Deep 35.7% Bomb 50.0% Other 9.1% Total 64.4%This is a very even contest. Manning is a bit better in medium passes and much better in deep ones but Romo has a big edge in bomb throws and a slight edge in short ones. The overall split between these two in 2008 is negligible but in 2007 and 2006 Romo’s percentages were quite superior over Manning’s (64.5% to 57.1% in 2007 65.6% to 58.7% in 2006). Again a metric segment goes in favor of Romo.Bad Decision PercentageThis metric gauges how often a quarterback makes a mistake with a pass that either leads to an interception or a near interception. These gaffes can range from staring at a receiver to not seeing a defender in a passing lane but the common thread is that they are errors that generate turnover opportunities for the opponent.The key to keep in mind in this metric is that small percentages make a huge difference. For example a 2.0% bad decision rate means that a passer is messing up once in every fifty passes. A 3.0% rate in this category doesn’t look that much higher but it means a quarterback’s error rate is now up to once in every thirty-three passes. To express this in game terms the 2.0% rate means the mistakes are coming about two times in every three games (or less if the team doesn’t throw often) while the 3.0% means they are probably coming once in every single contest.So how do Romo and Manning fare in this category? Thus far in 2008 they are about equal. Manning has a 2.5 % rate and Romo a 2.9% rate. That wasn’t the case in 2007 however as Romo’s 4.0% bad decision clip ranked him 5th worst among qualifying quarterbacks. Manning wasn’t that much better but his 3.4% rate was lower. Their 2006 totals were about equal (1.9% for Romo 1.8% for Manning) so that means that Manning gets the overall edge in this category albeit by moderate margin.IntangiblesThis is where the scouting eye comes in. I look for a lot of things when scouting QBs but it really boils down to one question – does he make his team play better than their talent level says they should?Take Philip Rivers. It is said that he possesses great intangibles and that those were a main reason his NC State teams went 34-17. The track record says something a bit different. To quote from Scientific Football 2006 “Winning two out of every three games is a praiseworthy feat…but in this case there should be a big asterisk next to it. Fourteen of [Rivers’] thirty-four wins came against teams that either ended the season with three wins or less or were non-Division 1A opponents. Two more victories came against teams that ended the season with four wins. Add them up and it means that nearly one-half of Rivers’ collegiate wins came against poor competition. Or to put it another way Rivers was 18-17 against good teams.”I point this out because Rivers and Manning came into the league at the same time and Rivers is always touted for his leadership while Manning has often been knocked for his lack of fire. I used to be one of the pundits who knocked Manning but I stopped doing this once I saw that his teams were doing better and going further than Rivers’ more talented Chargers teams.For instance Rivers led a team with a 12-14 win talent level to a 14-2 mark in 2006 but then piloted them to a home divisional playoff game loss. The 2007 Chargers were nearly as loaded as their predecessors and he guided them to a wild-card berth. He won the opening playoff game that season against a limited Tennessee roster and technically got the win in the divisional round but he wasn’t on the field when San Diego’s offense made their comeback. The Bolts were quite banged up for the AFC championship and couldn’t overcome the Patriots. Put it all together and it means that Rivers has but the single wild-card playoff win that he can claim as his own. That’s a poor record when you have a physically superior team as the Chargers were in those seasons.Contrast that to Manning. The Giants have always had a very good roster but my personnel eye says they were not in San Diego’s league. New York also played in a division that was strong from top to bottom unlike the AFC West. In spite of this Manning has led his team to more playoff berths and more playoff wins than Rivers has. I don’t like to lean solely on the win criterion as it has its weaknesses (see Trent Dilfer and the 2000 Ravens) but in this case Manning has done a lot more with a less than Rivers has so I’ve taken to giving him the edge in that matchup.Now let’s look at Romo. The Cowboys have been the near equals (if not equals) to the Chargers in roster strength the past couple of seasons and yet Romo has not a single playoff win to show for it. He also lost a home divisional game to a Manning-led Giants squad last year. I can’t put all of that on Romo but lack of leadership is one of the reasons that team is losing the big games and some of that does fall at the feet of the quarterback. That means Manning gets a large edge in this department and it’s the reason I have to go with Manning as the better QB.
 0,Two lawyers who have had an indelible impact on General Motors past and present were on hand Monday when it took its first steps into bankruptcy.Sitting in the front row at Fritz Henderson’s news conference held in what is normally the dining room of the law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges were Harvey R. Miller (right) who is leading G.M.’s bankruptcy case and Ira M. Millstein the attorney who counseled G.M.’s outside directors in a 1992 boardroom coup.Mr. Miller slipped out of the room at the end presumably to gather his things for a trip downtown (we’ll catch up with him later). But Mr. Millstein hung around to chat jovially with a handful of journalists. For some it was the first opportunity to meet a legendary figure in G.M. history. Mr. Millstein was instrumental in the decision by G.M.’s board to divide the duties of chairman and chief executive and give the chairman’s job to an outside director.That practice was short-lived and went away in 1996 when John F. Smith Jr. who had been named chief executive in 1992 assumed the chairman’s job. The two positions also were held by Rick Wagoner until he was dismisssed in March by the Obama adminsitration. His successor Mr. Henderson will not be getting the chairman’s title which has gone to Kent Kresa on an interim basis.A few hours after Mr. Millstein held court Mr. Miller was in court leading a case that attorneys at Weil first began to prepare last fall.During his opening remarks Mr. Miller emphasized what he called the company’s “herculean effort” to preserve the value of its assets. He stressed the dire state of the American auto industry. “As far as the automotive industry is concerned this is the worst of times since World War II” he said.In putting G.M. through its paces in bankruptcy court Mr. Miller was true to form consistently courteous to Judge Robert E. Gerber with insistent references to “your honor” and “sir.”He was also gracious to others notably to Andrew Rosenberg the Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison lawyer who represents a committee of some of G.M.’s largest bondholders. After Mr. Rosenberg spoke in support of G.M.’s restructuring plan noting that a new offer to his clients had wrung the support of 54 percent of G.M.’s bond debt Mr. Miller returned to the podium to say “This is a monumental step forward from where we were a week ago.”While Mr. Miller said in court that he didn’t want to follow exactly in the footsteps of Chrysler which has moved closer to moving most of its operations out of bankruptcy — but only after a bruising set of marathon hearings — he needn’t have worried on Monday. Judge Gerber swiftly approved G.M.’s raft of first-day hearings and even granted interim approval of the carmaker’s proposed sale and debtor-in-possession financing with minimum fuss.— Micheline Maynard and Michael J. de la Merced

 0,When the United States was awarded the rights to the 1994 World Cup the decision was greeted with similar howls by some soccer purists outside North America. There were even rumors FIFA could change its mind.But on Nov. 19 1989 a goal by midfielder Paul Caligiuri against Trinidad and Tobago sent the United States to the 1990 World Cup — and into a new era in its soccer history. The goal was called the shot heard ’round the world and it began a run of seven consecutive World Cup appearances.As FIFA brought its crown jewel to new continents in the decades that followed every host avoided the ignominy of making its World Cup debut on home soil. South Korea was a regular in the tournament long before it hosted in 2002 and its co-host Japan made its debut in 1998. Even South Africa the 2010 host had been in the tournament twice before.Ahead of the April 2016 draw for the final round of qualification for Russia Hassan al-Thawadi the head of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy the Qatari body overseeing organization of the 2022 World Cup stressed how vital it was that the team qualified for Russia. “It is important that we are there” he said at the time.Yet Qatar started badly with defeats in its first two qualifiers. With only the top two countries from the six-team group set to qualify automatically Qatar fired its coach the Uruguayan José Daniel Carreño in September and replaced him with his countryman Jorge Fossati.“It is very important to go to Russia” Fossati said ahead of his first task a game against South Korea in October. “It is important for our players to play at the highest level as much as possible and it is important for the confidence of the country as a football power.”

 9,A Government-controlled newspaper said today that the governor of China's central bank had been dismissed and a well-connected Chinese said the announcement was being circulated among senior officials in Beijing.Li Guixian the governor of the People's Bank of China is being replaced as part of a revamping of the financial sector according to Wen Wei Po a Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong. Several Chinese familiar with the case said that they too had learned of Mr. Li's removal but that it was unclear what the move meant for China's economic policies.Mr. Li a 55-year-old career Communist cadre who has headed the central bank since 1988 was apparently removed for two reasons. First he was blamed for allowing a $175 million financial scandal in which more than 100000 bondholders lost much of their capital. Move Toward Curbing GrowthAnd Mr. Li was regarded as being ineffective in curbing monetary growth at a time when the Chinese economy was overheating. His abrupt departure is likely to be seen as a sign that Beijing has decided it wants to curb the money supply limit the rampant speculation in real estate and reduce credit without creating cash shortages in the countryside.

 9,The competitive revolution in telecommunication took two encouraging steps forward this week. News Corporation announced a merger that promises to provide its customers with a broadcast satellite service fully equal if not superior to their local cable service. AT&T the long-distance carrier then announced that it had secretly developed a technology that would allow it to bring local phone service to people's homes without using the equipment of the regional Bell companies.The key in both cases is wireless communication. News Corporation which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and AT&T are threatening to break the monopoly choke hold of their competitors by sending their services over the air rather than laying fabulously expensive wires into everyone's home.News Corporation will invest $1 billion in a new service with Echostar Communications a small satellite broadcaster. The combined facilities will offer homes across most of the country a video service that includes hundreds of channels of high-resolution TV C.D.-quality sound and something that no other satellite service has so far been able to provide -- signals from at least some local television stations. Because satellite services have lacked local channels they have lured too few cable customers to keep cable rates down. By offering satellite customers local channels News Corporation will give households the option of saying goodbye to their local cable monopolies.AT&T also plans to bring its service into the home over the air rather than through a wire. The wireless technology will broadcast phone calls from towers directly to a radio box attached to the home. From there the call will travel through phone lines and equipment that already exist in everyone's home.
 9,''The glacier which covered much of the Northern Hemisphere reached its final southern limit on Staten Island'' said Edward Johnson curator of science at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. ''And when it retreated it left all these boulders kettle ponds a network of streams low hills and marshland.''To the Leni-Lenape tribe of the Algonquin Nation the island was called Aquehonga after the sandy banks of the southern shore. To the Dutch who first arrived in 1639 and promptly began pushing out the Indians it was Staaten Eylandt Island of the States -- the States being the name of the Dutch legislature.But to the English who came in large well-armed vessels in 1664 -- and promptly began pushing out the Dutch -- it was Richmond in honor of King Charles II's illegitimate son Charles Lennox the Duke of Richmond.It didn't take long for the English to consummate the island's first real estate deal. ''In 1670'' said Richard Dickenson the Staten Island Borough Historian ''Governor Thomas Lovelace purchased the island from the Indians.''''They had a different concept of what selling land was'' Mr. Dickenson said. ''To them everybody owned the land; nevertheless they went along with the charade.'' The price: an unknown quantity of coats kettles guns axes knives and wampum.In 1676 the tiny village of Tottenville at the southern tip of the island -- in fact the southern tip of New York State -- was first settled. And a century later on Sept. 11 1776 two months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence three members of the Continental Congress -- Benjamin Franklin John Adams and Edward Rutledge -- met with British Admiral Lord Richard Howe in what is now called the Conference House in Tottenville in an attempt to avert the Revolution. They didn't.In the 1800's village industries cropped up throughout South Richmond: fishing in Tottenville; brickmaking because of the fine clay in Charleston; oystering particularly by a group of free blacks from Maryland and Virginia along the western shore in Rossville. And that configuration of isolated towns with a few roads and farms between would hold as the pattern for development -- or more precisely limited development -- well into the 20th century.

 9,In its first action on spending for the coming fiscal year the Suffolk County Legislature today let stand an $818492 increase in the county's contribution to its community college.Critics said the increase the maximum allowed under a county law that caps rises in annual spending at 4 percent would mean higher property taxes."Everyone knows if we walk out of here and do nothing taxes will go up next year" said Sondra M. Bachety a Democrat from North Babylon before the votes.The increase requested by County Executive Robert J. Gaffney at the urging of officials of Suffolk County Community College automatically took effect when legislators failed to adopt measures that would have frozen the county's share at its current level of $20.5 million.

 9,Q. Do you expect a lot of celebrities to come in?A. Well I do because I've always treated them really well but I am not really concerned about them. I'm more concerned about my own celebrities -- the people who have followed me. I used to work two days at Le Madri two days at Coco Pazzo two days at Sapore. Wherever I go they go. It's pretty much the same crowd. Calvin Klein. Ralph Lauren. Donna Karan. People like that. Billy Joel.Q. Have you become friends with a lot of them?A. Through the years they invite me to their parties to their houses. Like Martha Stewart invites me to her house in the Hamptons every time she has a party.Q. Do you think your restaurant could become too trendy?A. No because I don't want to be trendy. I also want to get my neighborhood people. I treat everybody fine. You never know who anybody is. I want to start the trend of being nice.Q. Your former boss Pino Luongo recently said you'll need more than your "cute face and Spanish accent" to be successful. How did you take that?A To be honest I expect more than that from him. I think when somebody leaves you on good terms somebody who gave you their heart their blood everything you have in yourself I think you should shake their hand and say good luck. I think that was very unfair.

 9,Where have all the folkies gone? Those lone troubadours battered guitars in hand have all but disappeared from television and radio; they have either learned to lead bands a la Joni Mitchell and James Taylor or been banished from major record labels. Yet as it has since its invention the guitar still provides full accompaniment in portable form and some songwriters find that it's all they need. Even in the era of cantilevered haircuts and digital sound sampling solo songwriters are still with us on a circuit of coffeehouses clubs and independent record labels; recent releases include albums by Greg Brown Christine Lavin Fred Small Billy Bragg and Phranc.The folk guitar was once the most democratic of instruments inexpensive and easy to get started on; a singer could learn three chords in an afternoon. Now however the guitar has been supplanted by light cheap battery-powered keyboards with built-in rhythm patterns which don't even require calluses on a player's left hand. A songwriter who chooses to sling a guitar in 1985 is making an anti-style style statement choosing the vibrations of strings and wood over the oscillations of microchips the homespun over the high-tech. A keyboard player is a putative pop star; a guitarist by connotation is sincere.The modern folkie tends to draw on the same traditions as Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan - blues and ballads and country songs and Tin Pan Alley - although the definition of folk music has long since expanded to embrace world music. Yet the lone guitarist of the 1980's isn't exactly an echo of the 1960's. Recent collections on Vanguard (''Greatest Folksingers of the 1960's'') and Elektra Records (''Bleecker and MacDougal'') are a reminder that the 1960's folk boom was partially a rediscovery of old folk and blues tunes partially a political movement and less often an outlet for personal songs. In folkie songs of the 1980's personal and political messages intertwine. The songs tell stories instead of making political pronouncements but unlike the confessional songs of the 1970's their stories are likely to make a social point.Greg Brown measures the gap between hippie and yuppie in the first song on his fourth solo album ''In the Dark With You'' (Red House Records P.O. Box 4444 St. Paul Minn. 55104) ''Who Woulda Thunk It'' - about how the longing for creature comforts creeps up on former rebels. Mr. Brown who performs on National Public Radio's ''Prairie Home Companion'' sings in a deep baritone growl that can be wry and comforting like a latter-day Dave van Ronk counterpointed on the album by finger-picked guitar and mandolin and reedy accordion or harmonica. He has a knowing way with everyday details particularly when he's writing about hard times in ''Just a Bum'' and ''All the Money's Gone.'' His album is homey and down-to-earth and Mr. Brown is anything but self-important; in the album's title tune he sings ''I know less all the time/ Kiss me before I prove it's true.''

 9,This evening Mr. Hinson said "we agree with the thrust of the recommendations."The safety board also said oxidizers the class of chemicals that includes the oxygen generators in the Valujet crash should not be transported in cargo compartments that lack smoke or fire detectors; Mr. Hinson responded that his agency had already begun a review of how oxidizers are shipped. The safety board is an independent agency chartered by Congress to make recommendations to regulatory authorities at all levels of government. The F.A.A. usually but not always follows the recommendations; for example the safety board noted in the letter today that it had previously called for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers for cargo holds but that the aviation agency decided against such precautions.The letter said a Pan Am Boeing 707 cargo plane crashed in November 1973 at Logan International Airport in Boston because of a fire started by materials that were improperly packaged. In addition it cited a DC-10 parked at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago was destroyed by a fire after a technician mishandled an oxygen generator and an an American Airlines DC-9 had a fire in midflight in February 1988 because of unlabeled hazardous materials. That plane landed safely.The letter said that the cause of the Everglades crash was still under investigation but that there might have been as many as 144 oxygen generators on board which "created an extremely dangerous condition." They had been shipped without the protective caps that block them from being set off the board said.The generators had been removed from other Valujet planes by a contractor after their shelf life had expired but they had not been "fired" meaning that the oxygen-producing chemical reaction had not been set off. Such a step would have changed the generators from a hazard capable of starting fires to a chemical compound that can no longer burn or explode. It is mildly hazardous because it includes toxic barium salts but it is enclosed in a stainless-steel canister.Valujet and a contractor that had removed the generators from other Valujet aircraft Sabretech have publicly disagreed over whose fault it was that the generators were not fired.

 0,Updated 5:50 p.m. | A 90-year-old man at his home in Staten Island was attacked on Tuesday morning by two pit bulls that belonged to his neighbor the police said.The man who was later identified as Henry S. Piotrowski was bitten by the dogs on his arms and his legs and taken by emergency medical workers to Richmond University Medical Center in the West Brighton neighborhood where the police said he was in critical condition.The police said the attack occurred about 11 a.m. in the backyard of Mr. Piotrowski’s home at 94 John Street in the Elm Park section on the northern part of Staten Island. Upon arriving at 11:03 a.m. the police found the man with “severe wounds to his arms and legs” the authorities said.Mr. Piotrowski is an Army veteran who fought in a tank unit in World War II the authorities said.The police said that Mr. Piotrowski’s backyard and that of the dogs’ owner were somewhat adjoined but it remained unclear how the attack occurred. “The dogs got loose and somehow got into his private property and that is when the attack took place’’ a police spokesman said.The police said in a statement “No animals were at the scene when police arrived.” But later the authorities said the two dogs both pit bulls had been corralled at 59 Newark Avenue.The dogs — named Brutus and Popeye — were taken by Animal Care & Control of New York City to its shelter at 2336 Linden Boulevard in Brooklyn and were put down by injection said Richard P. Gentles a spokesman for the agency. He said that New York City dog owners are required to have licenses for their dogs to generally keep their dogs leashed in public and to ensure that their dogs have current rabies vaccinations. Mr. Gentles said it was not clear whether any of those requirements had been met for the two pit bulls.James McNair the owner of the dogs was in police custody at the 120th Precinct and prosecutors working for District Attorney Daniel M. Donovan Jr. were considering whether to file charges the police said.Sewell Chan and Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.
 9,Eugene Loring the dancer and choreographer who created ''Billy the Kid'' an American ballet classic died Monday in Kingston N.Y. after a long illness. He was 72 years old.Mr. Loring danced with leading American ballet companies appeared on the Broadway stage taught and continued to choreograph throughout his life. But it was for ''Billy the Kid'' one of the earliest and best works of the folklore genre in modern American ballet that Mr. Loring was best known.The one-act ballet was set to music by Aaron Copland. Its libretto by Lincoln Kirstein was based on the legendary outlaw William Bonney alias Billy the Kid. The ballet was performed for the first time in 1938 by Ballet Caravan with Mr. Loring in the title role. Three years later it entered the repertory of American Ballet Theater and was revived last spring by that company.A sympathetic look at the making of a criminal ''Billy the Kid'' unfolds in stark stylized processionals and confrontations that have the flavor of western novels movies and comic strips.

 9,The Government took actions today that would mildly stimulate Japan's economy authorizing an income tax cut and adopting budget guidelines for 1988 that depart from the no-growth policies of recent years.The tax reduction worth $8.7 billion a year ran into immediate political trouble because it was coupled with - and largely offset by - a new 20 percent tax on small savings accounts.The Cabinet also approved a budget outline for the 1988 fiscal year which starts April 1. It suggested that overall spending was not likely to change significantly an indication of the willingness of Japan to adhere to its professed commitment to stimulating its economy.In response to the Government's plan opposition parties began a boycott of parliament similar to one earlier this year that ultimately forced the withdrawal of another tax plan - a severe political defeat for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
 9,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students investigate the role of mathematics in their everyday lives. They then discover through reading a Times article and through analyzing a specific example of art that mathematics exists on a deeper ‘metaphoric’ level in art.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. List and discuss all that they do on a daily basis that involves mathematics both on obvious and more hidden levels.2. Read and discuss “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction.”3. Relate a mathematical concept metaphorically to a piece of art.Resources / Materials:paperpens/ pencilscopies of “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students list all the things that they do that involve mathematics. Students then share their lists with the class as the teacher writes suggestions on the board. Students then add to the class list by brainstorming other daily tasks or chores that involve mathematics.2. Read the article “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” and discuss the following questions:–The author of this piece argues that “Good Will Hunting” is not a movie about math just because much of the plot revolves around a mathematical genius. How does he support this argument? What stereotypes about mathematicians does he feel are promoted by the movie?–In what way does the movie “Sliding Doors” relate to mathematical concepts?–How does Chuck Close’s art retrospective incorporate mathematics?–How does the novel “Larry’s Party” relate to mathematical concepts?–What does the writer mean when he says that “mathematics like beauty is more than skin-deep”?3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students search for mathemetical metaphors in favorite books stories art pieces music movies or television shows. Students choose one of these examples and describe in writing the mathematical concept or theory it expresses. Teachers may need to help younger students with creating such metaphoric comparisons.Further Questions for Discussion:What are some examples of stereotypes about mathematicians and people who are interested in and good at doing math? How do movies and television promote these stereotypes?How does math apply to the profession that you want to pursue?What are some examples of mathematics employed in music?What are some examples of mathematics employed in dance?What is the relevance of mathematics in your daily life?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in classroom discussion and “mathematical metaphors in art” project.Vocabulary:dimunition derives peripheral discipline chaos theory trajectories intersect compression labyrinths symmetry geometry continuum abstract algebra profound intuitiveExtension Activities:1. Students interview a person who uses math in his or her occupation. Students should find out specifically how math is used in this occupation and obtain an example of a typical math problem (worked out to find a solution). This information can then be posted in the classroom.2. Study a famous mathematician or mathematical discovery and present this information to the class.3. Find another New York Times article dealing with mathematics in the “everyday” world to read and discuss with your classmates.Interdisciplinary Connections:Science: Relate perceptions and stereotypes of scientists to those of mathematicians. How are scientists portrayed in movies and on television? How are these media stereotypes similar? How are they different?Language Arts: Study the “mathematics of poetry” (specifically meter and rhyme schemes).Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmark: Understands that mathematicians often represent real things using abstract ideas like numbers or lines- they then work with these abstractions to learn about the things they represent.Art Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmark: Knows how various concepts and principles are used in the arts and disciplines outside the arts (e.g. balance shape pattern)Grades 9-12Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmarks: Understands that theories in mathematics are greatly influenced by practical issues- real-world problems sometimes result in new mathematical theories and pure mathematical theories sometimes have highly practical applications; Understands that mathematics provides a precise system to describe objects events and relationships and to construct logical arguments; Understands that mathematics often stimulates innovations in science and technologyArt Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmarks: Knows ways in which various art media can be integrated; Understands how elements materials technologies artistic processes and organizational principles are used in similar and distinctive ways in the various art formsThis lesson plan may be used to address the academic standards listed above. These standards are drawn from Content Knowledge: A Compendium of Standards and Benchmarks for K-12 Education; 3rd and 4th Editions and have been provided courtesy of the Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning in Aurora Colorado.

 9,Mr. Skyler's comments came after the city had already announced a $2 million plan to upgrade the Parade Grounds saying the money would be used to build a football field to refurbish some soccer grounds and to rebuild two baseball diamonds. The notoriously bad drainage and watering systems at the 40-acre site were also to be redesigned.But if the Mets plan goes through as initially described it appears that at least two fields will be lost to general use and a third will be taken over for parking at least temporarily.Angered by what he sees as the administration's recalcitrance in disclosing its plan the Brooklyn borough president Howard Golden has scheduled a public meeting of the borough's board for today. Mr. Golden's office said the special session at 6 p.m. in Borough Hall was called to force the administration to meet with the community adding that officials with the Economic Development Corporation and the Parks Department had been invited to speak.The city officials are likely to be met by a barrage of questions from why the administration chose a short-season Mets farm team for the site to how other uses for the fields will be curtailed particularly the youth soccer games now held at the Parade Grounds.For the last several months Mr. Golden has accused the Giuliani administration of not acting in the best interests of Brooklyn on the deal. He has said that the administration's refusal to consider other minor league ball clubs is short-sighted and that a higher-level team -- playing a full season instead of the shorter Single A summer schedule -- will bring more money to the borough and more fans to the games.In the meantime parents whose children now play soccer lacrosse or other field games on the Parade Grounds fear that they will be squeezed out. And those living around the Parade Grounds worry that problems with securing a stadium site in Coney Island will leave the farm team playing in their neighborhood permanently -- bringing with it traffic unruly fans and parking problems.Mostly those opposing the plan say they just want some input before the city's Franchise and Concession Review Committee votes on the plan in two weeks.''This is a big thing for everyone involved in the Parade Grounds and we really deserved to hear the facts about what's being proposed'' said Howard Helene whose 9-year-old son has grown up playing on the fields. ''Maybe this is a good thing for the park but because of the way it's been handled nobody really knows.''

 0,Timothy Egan on American politics and life as seen from the West.The media jackals have been all over Representative Michele Bachmann for misstatements zany ideas and alterations to history as she kicked off her presidential run in Waterloo Iowa home to serial killer John Wayne Gacy — not the actor John Wayne as she said in her evocation of dreamy small-town life.From her contention that eliminating the minimum wage would mean full employment to her assertion that “almost all” people in the “gay lifestyle” have been abused these things can be explained. Bachmann has a worldview that requires constant reshaping in the face of real life. However if God is writing the script for her campaign as she says He needs a fact-checker.When pressed this week on her unique view of American origins — that “the very same founders that wrote those documents worked tirelessly until slavery was no more” — Bachmann doubled-down citing as her only proof the abolitionist John Quincy Adams. Given that Adams was just 8 years old when the Declaration of Independence was approved by the Continental Congress 10-year-old Sasha Obama should be remembered for killing the world’s top terrorist.All of the above only fortifies Bachmann’s position with a Republican base that would eat dog food for breakfast if the government said you should not.But what is more troubling is the issue raised by taxpayer payments for various Bachmann family enterprises. This is where rigid ideology meets mushy reality. The Bachmann family farm in Wisconsin got $251000 in federal handouts from 1995 to 2009 according to the invaluable table of subsidies put out annually by the Environmental Working Group a Washington-based research organization.There’s no story there Bachmann insisted this week because she and her husband didn’t get a dime from the farm. It went to her late father-in-law she said. If that were so why did she list herself and husband as financial partners in the farm for every year that she has been in Congress? Are her Congressional disclosure forms accurate the ones with a handwritten declaration of earning “farm income” of up to $102500 from the Bachmann limited partnership?Her husband Marcus Bachmann while farming the government one way through the business of his parents tills another field of federal money with his mental health clinic in Lake Elmo Minn. which offers “quality Christian counseling” for the troubled. The clinic has collected Medicaid payments of roughly $137000 since 2005 NBC News reported this week on top of $24000 in state funds to train the clinic’s staff.Fine. It’s all legal. Wouldn’t every small business love to have a stream of reliable government revenue. And the hypocrisy of a socialism-hating Tea Party leader professing to own a piece of a farm that has been engaged in the nation’s most indefensible socialist scheme is just standard behavior for a politician worthy of the calling.Bachmann’s fabrications show a brain fevered in cognitive dissonance. She has to believe that the founders were perfect and divinely inspired — not flawed men who rose to greatness. Not in Thomas Jefferson’s case even much of a Christian and an owner of slaves valued as 3/5 of a person in those same heaven-sent blueprints.So she tells a fable and like Sarah Palin when caught in a lie refuses to admit the mistake. Her supporters cite Barack Obama the candidate who mentioned that he’d been to “57 states” in the 2008 campaign. See he makes stuff up too! The obvious difference is that Obama did not continue to insist on the accuracy of the error.Farm subsidies are at least consistent with modern Republican ideas on wealth concentration. But in every other way they make a mockery of Bachmann’s political philosophy.Even in times of bumper crops and record prices rich landowners reap a harvest of tax dollars. Many of them like those self-described partners in agriculture Michele and Marcus Bachmann seldom get any dirt under their fingernails. About 90000 checks went out last year to landowners who live in cities. Ah to be a therapist with a field of federally fertilized corn.Nationwide 10 percent of the subsidized farms get 76 percent of all the handouts: $447873 per recipient over the last 16 years the database shows.These payments assure protection from the cruel swings of the free market. Bachmann herself has pressed for even more farm socialism. In 2009 she praised the Agriculture Department for injecting money into the pork industry in an effort to keep prices up — and she urged further government intervention.“You don’t privatize your profit and socialize your losses” she said this week to a big cheer. If only it were true on the Bachmann family farm.A version of this article appeared in print on July 2 2011.Note: An earlier version of this article mistakenly implied that Jefferson helped write the Constitution; that has been corrected.

 9,The van stuffed with blockers and the slight running back with the misleadingly vulnerable appearance set out from a hotel on Canal Street and pointed west toward Baton Rouge and the home of Willie Wheeler. Warrick Dunn's grandmother was ready. There was crayfish etouffee her grandson's favorite and gumbo and ribs and macaroni and cheese more than enough for everyone.As Dunn approached the final days of his four years at Florida State University a career that started with a painful departure from home was ending with a memorable return. For the offensive linemen that will lead him throughout the Sugar Bowl Thursday night against Florida and for Pooh Bear Williams the fullback whose son is Dunn's godson here was a chance to go home with him.''To me it's just a way of saying thank you'' Dunn said. ''For the four years and definitely this year for the criticism those guys have been through. This is a big thank you. Thank you for keeping me healthy. Thank you for opening holes.''There was also a message from his grandmother whose football knowledge is said to be as extensive as her cooking expertise. ''I thought she'd threaten them that they better block'' Dunn said.
 9,Can New York City's Board of Education do anything right? It has a dismal record on counting dropouts. It stands by while hundreds of homeless children also go school-less. It has allowed the search for a chancellor to drag on for months. The board badly needs a victory and a prime opportunity now presents itself: contract negotiations with school custodians.Over the years school officials have ceded control of the 1000 school buildings to custodians who operate both as city employees and independent contractors. They receive an allocation from which they pay other workers and purchase supplies. That might make sense if the custodians were held accountable for the condition of schools. But the supervisors who oversee and rate them for promotions now belong to the same union. Custodians are required to clean schools only every other day. Frustrated principals complain that custodians refuse minor maintenance like changing light bulbs or fixing broken toilets.More they are allowed to charge ''opening fees'' to outside groups for use of classrooms gymnasiums and other school facilities during non-class hours a privilege that helps bring their average annual salary to $50000.City Council President Andrew Stein rightly denounces this astonishing arrangement as ''legalized extortion.'' Robert Wagner Jr. president of the Board of Education says he is determined to ''reclaim control of the schools.'' Doing so will require dramatic and fundamental change. At a minimum district and borough managers need to be removed from the custodians' union and made directly accountable to the board and principals need the authority to order maintenance work directly from their schools' custodians. Reducing or eliminating opening fees is essential to after-hours and weekend programs that benefit whole neighborhoods.

 0,A security company that was cited for several security lapses at Logan International Airport after Sept. 11 will no longer screen passengers or baggage at the airport under an agreement reached today with the state.The company Argenbright Security Inc. agreed to the settlement after the state police upset by the lapses tried to revoke its license on Nov. 15.The announcement came hours before a scheduled hearing on the Argenbright license issue before a state police board. Col. John DiFava of the state police Logan's interim security director said the compromise met his goal: cracking down on mistakes by airport screeners.''It's not a question of trying to blow up Argenbright'' Colonel DiFava said. ''It's a question of trying to get security at Logan. I was sensitive to the fact that they were fighting for their very survival.''

 9,To the Editor:Republican discomfort over David E. Duke's Congressional candidacy (news article April 29) cannot be explained solely by the fact that he has aligned himself with the Republican Party and that many of his positions are widely accepted in the party.Although the Republican National Committee and leading national Republicans have disavowed Mr. Duke his racism and his anti-Semitism the Republican Governor of Louisiana Mike Foster has repeatedly refused to criticize him remarking that several Republican candidates in the open primary are friends.So long as a Republican as prominent as Mr. Foster can accept Mr. Duke's candidacy Republicans everywhere must accept the risk that they will be identified with Mr. Duke's obscene views.PHIL BAUMNew York April 29 1999The writer is executive director of the American Jewish Congress.
 0,The Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania has received the art collection of the modernist artist Peter Grippe including his own works as well as art by Alexander Calder Willem de Kooning Franz Kline and others The Allentown Morning Call reported. Grippe a Cubist-inspired sculptor and printmaker who died in 2002 had accumulated the collection of more than 500 works in his Long Island home and studio and New York City apartment. It was donated to the museum by his wife Florence who had previously worked with its executive director Greg Perry at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. Though Grippe’s sculptures drawings and prints form the bulk of the collection it also includes rare items like the portfolio “21 Etchings and Poems” which contains work by Frank O’Hara Dylan Thomas and de Kooning. The Morning Call also said that a fund would be established for the museum in honor of Peter and Florence Grippe.

 0,In this edition: upheaval in the Republican presidential nomination contest an old foe returns college football chaos and baseball collapses.ReactionsThe Republican nominating process has been dominated recently by rekindled interest in Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Republican donors and luminaries have been trying to coax him into the ring so FiveThirtyEight explored whether the prospect of Candidate Christie should more unnerve Gov. Rick Perry of Texas or Mitt Romney.The New Republic’s Jonathan Cohn examined the origins of surging interest in Mr. Christie specifically but also the well-worn phenomenon of “savior candidates.” Mr. Cohn wisely observed that “in modern politics ‘savior’ candidates are never again as popular as they are the day before they announce.”But lest Mr. Christie’s admirers get too feverish The San Francisco Chronicle has a Bloomberg roundup of the (many many) times Mr. Christie has said he will not run.One reason attention turned to Mr. Christie was Mr. Perry’s somewhat abysmal debate performance. FiveThirtyEight noted the subsequent sagging in Mr. Perry’s favorability and horse-race numbers. Slate’s John Dickerson in a walk-through of Mr. Perry’s debate missteps argued that the mistakes were particularly damaging because they undercut the heart of the case Mr. Perry was making to the Republican primary electorate that as Mr. Dickerson wrote “Perry is one of you — he prays he speaks plainly he’s from a small town in Texas — and Moneybags Mitt ain’t.”At Outside the Beltway Doug Mataconis took a step back and challenged the importance placed on presidential debate performances in the first place.Another upshot of the emerging unhappiness with Mr. Perry was renewed interest in Herman Cain. Way back in May FiveThirtyEight outlined several reasons for taking Mr. Cain’s campaign seriously. Mr. Cain’s national poll numbers proceeded to rise then fall and now they are up again.Well The Wall Street Journal seemed to have taken notice. The Journal’s columnist Daniel Henninger in an column headlined “Taking Cain Seriously” argued that Mr. Cain’s business-heavy politics-lite resume — not typical for a White House aspirant — should be a plus in voters’ minds not a negative.Salon’s Steve Kornacki however took the resurgence of Mr. Cain as well as Newt Gingrich another way. Mr. Kornacki wrote that the improved outlook for the two candidates “may be the surest sign yet of Rick Perry’s failure to meet his potential.”In The American Thinker John Zeigler took issue with FiveThirtyEight’s analysis of the Pennsylvania G.O.P.’s plan to remake how the state apportions its electoral votes. (Mr. Zeigler and FiveThirtyEight have had previous disagreements).Leaving politics Nate’s analysis of college football fandom and its implications for conference realignment — which appeared at The Quad — drew a mixed review from On the Banks a blog focused on Rutgers football.FiveThirtyEight performed a preemptive autopsy on the Boston Red Sox late-season crack-up and then dissected its final heart-breaking (or uplifting depending on your loyalties) chapter. The Financial Times’ blog Alphaville published an interesting article explaining how Boston’s collapse illuminates another breakdown — the 2008 financial free-fall.And finally our Comment-of-the-Half-Month goes to… Chrislav from New York City. In a not strictly on-topic response to “Bill Buckner Strikes Again” she advised single women to go see “Moneyball” and not just for Brad Pitt. The movie Chrislav wrote “attracts smart men not so much the shoot ’em up car-crash gun fightin’ type but thoughtful sensitive baseball-loving men.” She concludes:So girls — you say you don’t know where to meet great guys? I say put your best dress on call up your girlfriends head for the local movie theater playing “Moneyball” get there early make a few trips to the concession stand to scout out the audience and your chance of meeting that special guy there are way better than your chances of meeting one in a bar.Thank you to the cupid-inclined Chrislav (unless you secretly work for Sony Pictures Entertainment).ReadsAt The Monkey Cage Erica Chenoweth wrote an insightful article about terrorism and democracy.A National Journal article by Ronald Brownstein and Scott Bland unpacks new census data and finds “the Great Recession and its aftermath have battered virtually every state in the nation—and that some of the heaviest blows have landed on states that may loom the largest in the 2012 presidential election.”Ezra Klein at The Washington Post highlighted research that studied the uncertainty argument which holds that the threat of new taxes and regulations is the root of the tepid economic picture.Bill Adair at PolitiFact whose data FiveThirtyEight delved into recently looked at the Truth-O-Meter ratings amassed by political pundits.And — although not technically a read — our very own Nate Silver was interviewed by Howard Kurtz for his CNN show “Reliable Sources.” Here is Part 1 and Part 2 of the video.
 0,For schnitzel or a cup of coffee or just for conversation the Frank Sinatra as students called the student center whose cafeteria was bombed today drew the range of Hebrew University's visiting and full-time students: Italians Americans South Koreans and Israeli Jews and Arabs.Like the cafeteria Hebrew University itself is one of the few places where Israel's Jews and its Arabs who make up 20 percent of the country's population of six million mix and freely debate their differences -- far more collegially than they do for example in Israel's fractious Parliament. Relations can be strained students say but they have remained peaceful on campus.Before today. the current conflict had been felt on campus not only in the sharpening political debate but also in the declining enrollment of Americans in the Rothberg International School steps from the site of the bombing in the Frank Sinatra which killed at least seven people and wounded more than 80.Opened in 1925 Hebrew University has grown like the Jewish nationalism it sought to promote and its history has paralleled Israel's own turbulent development. From 33 faculty members and 141 students it has grown to include 1400 senior faculty members and 23000 full-time students spread over several campuses.

 9,DOMESTIC immunity for assault and battery became extinct when the New York Domestic Relations Law was amended by the State Legislature in 1937. This will come as a surprise to police officers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties intake departments in our Criminal and Family Courts social workers and some legal advisers.In 1978 battered wives are advised that they have but two courses of action apart from divorce: file a charge against the husband in Criminal Court or petition the Family Court for protection. The old question “When did you stop beating your wife?” underscores one of the prevalent myths in our society — the belief that domestic immunity still exists.Historically domestic immunity meant that a husband and wife could not sue each other for assault and battery on the theory that after marriage a man and a woman became a legal unity. With the merger of the wife and husband any injury to her was an injury to him. This worked well enough — when for example the wife was swindled by a third party — by entitling the husband to sue for damages to his wife.The other justification for this interesting fiction was the protection of the sanctity of the home on the ground that marriage partners should settle their
 0,There’s no other series on television now quite like the TNT cop drama “Southland” for better and for worse. No show advertises its desire to be taken seriously — its bid for instant-classic status — as insistently as this visually austere account of the daily lives of Los Angeles patrol officers and detectives.That intention is telegraphed right away in the sepia-toned opening-credits montage with its images of the Los Angeles River and of Richard Ramirez the Night Stalker. “Southland” wants to be seen alongside Chandler and Ellroy “Chinatown” and “L.A. Confidential” as part of the Southern California-noir pantheon.That didn’t matter to NBC which abruptly canceled the show in October before its second season had even begun. The series drew good reviews but middling-to-poor ratings dropping as low as 4.6 million total viewers during a seven-episode trial run last spring. It had the potential to radiate prestige — to be the type of production that network suits like to be associated with — but it wasn’t drawing viewers in. And NBC had devoted its 10 p.m. time slot the show’s natural home to Jay Leno.Into the breach stepped the cable channel TNT which doesn’t need to attract as many viewers as the broadcast networks do. It reran the seven first-season episodes (the premiere in January drew two million people) and beginning Tuesday will show six new episodes that were completed before NBC pulled the plug. No announcement has been made about the show’s future beyond those six; once again “Southland” finds itself auditioning.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe show has always played a classic double game: it takes the “realistic” nonsensational 9-to-5 approach to police work while bringing in as much action violence and sex around the edges as possible. Episodes begin with chaotic spectacles — the aftermath of a shooting a car rolling and exploding during a high-speed chase — and then become long flashbacks. If you sit through the quotidian detail of the cops’ days you’ll get to see the car blow up again.

 9,While most Central and Eastern European countries clamor for the swiftest possible admission to the European Union Norwegians have for the second time rejected an invitation to join. This week's referendum was only an advisory vote but the Norwegian Parliament which has the official say will not defy the electorate's advice.Norway's voters are not crazy. Their country is indeed a special case -- already a NATO member rich well run and with an economic structure that might have made it a net loser from membership in strictly economic terms. Its main export oil does not depend on privileged access to European markets. Its well-managed fisheries will now not have to admit Spanish Portuguese or other E.U. trawlers or accept the suspect custodianship of Brussels fishocrats.So long as these resources remain plentiful going it alone makes some economic sense especially for the rural people who cast most of the no votes. Once those resources start running down Norway can count on yet another invitation to join.On the other hand those working in manufacturing and service businesses could suffer from reduced access to European consumers and investment. That helps explain the strong yes vote in Oslo and Bergen Norway's main cities. Moreover all Norwegians may soon come to regret their country's isolation from European political councils at a time when important new security and financial institutions are being shaped.

 0,Stanley Fish on education law and society.Nothing gets the juices and the comments flowing better than a column on religion and the liberal state. But before attempting a response to the issues raised by readers of my previous column I would like to offer a couple of clarifications.First by “liberal” and “liberalism” I do not mean as some posters assumed a position on the political continuum at the other end of which would be “conservative” and “conservatism.” Liberalism is the name of an enlightenment theory of government characterized by an emphasis on procedural rather than substantive rights: the law protects individual free choice and is not skewed in the direction of some choices or biased against others; the laws framed by the liberal state are or should be neutral between competing visions of the good and the good life; the state intervenes aggressively only when the adherents of one vision claim the right to act in ways that impinge upon the rights of others to make their own choices.You are free to believe that salvation comes only through faith in Jesus Christ and to order your behavior accordingly. You are not free to coerce others either by physical force or the force of law to share your faith and behave as you do. Adherence to the primacy of individual choice and to the idea that law should not enshrine any orthodoxy is compatible with any politics (except an avowedly racial sexual or religious politics). Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan are both classical liberals.The key distinction underlying classical liberalism is the distinction between the private and the public. This distinction allows the sphere of political deliberation to be insulated from the intractable oppositions that immediately surface when religious viewpoints are put on the table. Liberalism tells us that religious viewpoints should be confined to the home the heart the place of worship and the personal relationship between oneself and one’s God.When the liberal citizen exits the private realm and enters the public square he or she is supposed to leave religious commitments behind and function as a stripped-down entity as an abstract-not-full personage who makes political decisions not as a Jew or a Christian or a Muslim but as what political scientist Michael Sandel calls an “unencumbered self” a self unencumbered by ethnic racial gender class or religious identities. (Some theorists allow the liberal citizen to think politically through a religious lens as long as the policies advocated can be stated in secular terms; other insist that the liberal citizen should not even have religious thoughts when operating in the public sphere.) The basic notion is captured nicely (if hostilely) by Jeffrey: “A human being is first a human being before he or she becomes infected with the virus of religious ideology and superstition.”Now some religions — notably forms of Lockean Protestantism — reflect in their doctrines the private-public split liberalism requires. Others — some versions of Christian fundamentalism some versions of Orthodox Judaism some versions of Islam — don’t. Such a religion as Dave points out “cannot be separated from its role as an entire political/governmental system.” That is it won’t respect the private-public distinction; its adherents want to see its strictures and regulations enacted in every corner of daily life not just in the privacy of the home or chapel.The question is what does the liberal state do with those religious believers — the popular answer in the comments is “tell them to go back where they came from” — and my contention and the only one I make (in agreement with John Milbank) is that the liberal state is incapable of doing anything with them except regard them as many of the posters do as fanatical medieval crazy dictatorial and downright dangerous. As I point out liberalism’s inability to regard strong religious claims — claims that spill out into public life — as anything but a mistake and a transgression is not something liberalism can correct or get beyond; it is the inevitable (and blameless) reflection of what liberalism is and must be if it is to sustain its particular not to say peculiar brand of universalism a universalism that operates by reducing persons to formal entities all of which are in the essential political respect exactly the same. (It’s universalism writ small.)When I say that is the only contention I put forward I am responding to these readers who chided me for recommending a surrender of legal jurisdiction in at least some areas to religious courts and tribunals. Chris protests that “this article’s message is that we should alter our current system to adhere to [Shariah] law.” I offer no such message and in fact I offer no message at all. I am certainly not implying “that stoning a woman for adultery is something a liberal state ought to allow” (glennvirt). I’m just foregrounding an issue reporting on its having been raised controversially by the Archbishop of Canterbury and alerting readers to a new volume (“Shari’a in the West”) that takes up the matter in depth and includes let me add full and detailed discussions of the dangers to women’s rights associated with the legitimization of Shariah or other comprehensive religious codes in Western democracies.The danger is not theoretical or far away. Dean Jamison alerts us to a 2010 decision by a judge in New Jersey that a Muslim man from Morocco accused of sexually abusing his wife did not have criminal intent because he “was operating under his belief that . . . his desire to have sex when . . . he wanted to was something consistent with his practices” — according to testimony he had said “You are my wife I can do anything to you” — and was therefore “not prohibited.” In other words “I was merely acting on the basis of and at the behest of my Muslim faith and committed no wrong.”An appellate court overturned the judge’s ruling declaring that what the husband believed was irrelevant to the question of whether he had acted criminally; but the principle invoked — this is the way we do it where I come from and so I shouldn’t be punished for doing it here — is not foreign to U.S. courts where it has had some success more often in the penalty or sentencing phases than in the determination of innocence or guilt.The name of the principle is the “cultural defense” — the argument by a defendant often but not always an immigrant that his or her allegedly criminal behavior should be excused or subject to a lesser penalty because in the culture of origin that behavior is an accepted and even commanded norm. The cultural defense is obviously distinct from the issue of establishing religious tribunals alongside the tribunals of the sovereign state. In a way the person pleading the cultural defense is saying that he has brought the tribunal of his religious faith with him by virtue of having deeply internalized its precepts and imperatives. The question raised by the cultural defense is “When people come to America [do] they have to give up their way of doing things?” (Margaret Fung quoted by Cathy Young Chicago Tribune July 8 1992).The answer divides social and legal commentators in a way that mirrors the division produced by the specter of “supplementary” religious courts: The “larger debate” explains legal scholar Doriane Lambelet Coleman “concerns whether there is and should be a unifying American culture that guides our institutions including the justice system or whether the United States is and should be a culturally pluralistic nation in all respects including in the law” (Doriane Lambelet Coleman “Individualizing Justice Through Multiculturalism: The Liberals’ Dilemma” Columbia Law Review June 1996). Or if I may rephrase slightly does the (undoubted ) fact that the United States is very much a pluralistic nation provide a normative basis for plural legal orders? Does multiculturalism as a demographic reality demand multiculturalism as a principle of legal decision-making?There are three responses one might give to these questions and to the cultural defense when it is invoked. (1) I see your point; you were acting in the grip of a sincere belief; go and sin no more (2) That may be the way they do it back home but you’re here now and our laws trump your culturally acquired beliefs and (3) That may be the way they do it back home but here we do it differently and the way we do it here is the right way and should be the way it’s done in the culture you came from.Response #1 (not often given in its strong form by U.S. courts) acknowledges the legal relevance of deep religious beliefs to the question of culpability and is in sync with the spirit of multiculturalism. Response #2 says no in the U.S. the legal system operates independently of anyone’s religious beliefs and is undergirded by neutral procedural norms. The interesting thing is that both #1 and #2 accept the logic of multiculturalism — different strokes for different folks. It’s just that the first would apply the logic to individuals and the second to nations: yes there are different forms of law in different cultures but you’re in ours now.The problem with this stance is that it makes law’s shape a matter of political power and has nothing positive to affirm in case the political winds shift and bring with them a new kind of law. Response #3 on the other hand is genuinely universal; it recognizes cultural difference and the existence of many legal systems but insists that there is only one right way to conceive of law and that nations that conceive of law differently — by for example encoding male supremacy or corporal punishment for female adultery — are not just different; they’re wrong.Multicultural deference procedural neutrality as a local norm procedural neutrality as a norm every nation should embody in its laws. These three alternative conceptions of law are in play in every advanced society on earth including ours. More than a few posters were amazed that the question of plural legal jurisdictions was being debated in this day and age and wondered why The Times would devote its coveted space to matters settled long ago. The truth is that they are by no means settled and given patterns of migration and what C.S. Peirce called the “tenacity of belief” they never will be.

 0,Have you got a third?Bret: If Washington had known someone like Trump would have become president of the United States of America he might have been powerfully tempted to surrender to Cornwallis at Yorktown.That being said I do have a third point! I fear impeachment will lose much of its moral stigma and political force if it ends up coming down to a party-line vote. But that’s pretty much what’s most likely to happen if it comes to a vote unless there’s some new damning disclosure. And impeachment in the House will definitely not lead to conviction in the Senate unless shrimps whistle pigs fly and at least 20 Republicans vote with the Democrats to obtain a two-thirds majority.Gail: The House should do what the House should do and let those Senators from swing states answer for it next year. Four?Bret: Well and here’s my main point: Impeachment will wind up helping Trump. Many Americans will wonder why a lawfully elected president should be removed from office for no violation of the law. They’ll say it was just a matter of Trump being Trump. They’ll ask why Nancy Pelosi didn’t wait for a transcript of the phone call or testimony from key officials before beginning the impeachment process. They’ll wonder how that process will do to help them in their life. And some of them including some swing voters may come to see Trump as a victim of elite liberals and “deep state” agents who they’ll say are motivated more by their hatred for Trump than for their concern for the country.All that being said I’m not at all sure I’m right about any of this. Too many friends whose opinions I deeply respect are on your side of the argument. So if I can add a fifth point it’s that I’m persuadable. I suspect plenty of others might be too.Gail: Five kinda works for me too. But if I’m Pelosi I cannot see just sitting back and letting this all slide. Let the House do its work. Investigations will continue. God knows what new discoveries they’ll make. Just keep the pressure on.Bret: One question that obviously needs answering is what motivated Trump to delay the $400 million or so in aid to Ukraine before that phone call. Arguably that’s a violation of the 1974 presidential impoundment act though Trump eventually relented to congressional pressure and released the money. And I’d like to know how Rudy Giuliani became our shadow secretary of state which is kind of like letting Chris Farley from Saturday Night Live play the understudy to Slim Pickens in “Dr. Strangelove” (rest both their souls).

 9,Stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange closed last month with a small decline on average in dull trading.Hectic trading was dominant in the first week of August due to international tension in Southeast Asia. However after that flurry of trading excitement ended the market settled into a dull trading pattern for the final 16 sessions of the month.On August 3 President Johnson ordered “retaliatory action against gunboats and certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.”The following day volume spurted to 4.78 million shares from 3783745 on Monday and the New York Times combined average fell 7.38 points. Volume was heavy on Aug. 5 as the market rallied and rose at the close of trading when it was learned that this nation's offensive action in the Gulf of Tonkin would be of a limited nature. Sales on that day totaled 6166015 shares.

 0,For buildings with hot-water heating systems it is possible to make adjustments by using an "outdoor reset control." With such a device Mr. Gifford said the temperature of the water coursing through the building can be adjusted up or down in response to the outdoor temperature."It's like a dimmer switch for the heating system" he said.He explained that while hot water systems without a reset control are either "all on" during the heating cycle or "all off" between cycles systems that use the device always have hot water running through the pipes but they vary the temperature of that water according to the outdoor temperature. As a result Mr. Gifford said the system produces just the amount of heat the building needs at a given moment and does so more evenly.Steam systems have even more noticeable peaks and valleys of heat and cold because they are always either "all on" or "all off" and because it is generally not possible to vary the temperature of steam.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In one-pipe steam systems - usually found in buildings less than seven stories high - a thermostatic valve can replace the air vent."It doesn't shut off the radiator completely but it can reduce the heat output" Mr. Gifford said.Edward Winiarski president of Optimum Applied Systems in Hawthorne N.Y. said his company's Heat Computer system provides another way of controlling heat in large buildings. Internal temperatures in a building are monitored with remote sensors - wired or wireless - that are installed in a select number of apartments. Once temperatures in a majority of these apartments reach a preset level the computer turns off the heat.The system which costs from $3000 for a basic model to $10000 for a unit with 18 sensors is guaranteed to produce savings of at least 15 percent over the course of the heating season according to Mr. Winiarski.Additional information is available at www.yourcontrolfreaks.com.

 0,Photo“If it happened here can it happen again and if so where?” a newscaster asks at the start of “Piranha 3DD” as the camera pans the abandoned Lake Victoria where the 2010 film “Piranha 3D” took place. In place of the “it” in her inquiry read “the making of a dumb horror parody about killer fish that like to bite private parts.” The answer of course is yes it can.As for the “where” the action in this inept sequel moves to a water park called “The Big Wet” where the sleazy Chet (David Koechner) over the objections of his co-owner and stepdaughter Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) has added an “adult pool” section and prehistoric piranha apparently don’t care for it. They have found their way to the park via underground waterways and soon they’re chowing down.A few stars from the earlier film like Christopher Lloyd (the closest thing to funny this movie has) and Ving Rhames reprise their roles. Others stayed away but have been replaced by the likes of Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff (who plays himself).The director John Gulager has no idea how to mix his ingredients to create a savvy self-parody. Instead he flings comic bits and gross-out gags around desperately. The signature joke of this series seems to be castration. Just as in the earlier film a male organ becomes fish food. Why aim high when you can aim low?
 0,Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees has drawn great attention this week for his activities on and off the field and the fans at Fenway Park — informed opinionated and sophisticated about baseball — are having a good time with him tonight as he faces their first-place team.When Rodriguez batted for the first time in the second inning more than a dozen customers in the box seats near the Yankees’ dugout wore yellow Halloween masks that showed the face of a woman with blond hair. They were a reference to reports and photographs that have placed Rodriguez on road trips with a female friend to whom he is not married.In the Boston half of the second when the inning ended on a pop-up to Rodriguez who plays third base thousands of fans yelled “Mine! Mine!” as the ball came down. That was a reference to the accusation against Rodriguez by the Toronto Blue Jays that Rodriguez yelled the same thing to a Toronto infielder Howie Clark on Wednesday while running the bases causing Clark to back off from a pop-up and let it drop.The Blue Jays accused Rodriguez of unprofessional conduct. After Rodriguez caught the ball tonight he softly flipped it into the crowd for a souvenir a rather common gesture of sportsmanship that many players perform. However many fans urged the man who caught the ball to throw it back. So he did an unusual move more often performed only by fans in the outfield when an opponent hits a home run.Fenway security guards approached the man who threw the ball back and spoke to him but it did not appear that he was ejected.When Rodriguez batted in the third inning he hit a hard drive off the Green Monster in left field which often results in hard and long caroms. When Rodriguez tried to reach second base for a double he was thrown out by a wide margin — left fielder Manny Ramirez to second baseman Dustin Pedroia. The fans cheered loudly. Rodriguez as he approached the dugout inexplicably clapped his hands as if applauding himself.

 9,Edward Keaney an analyst with Volpe Welty in San Francisco said the new contract would mean "more work and less sleep for that whole group of investment bankers and lawyers trying to cobble together the Wellpoint-Health Systems deal."The Health Systems board approved the Wellpoint deal Thursday before the Pentagon announced it had selected Health Systems but the deal is not closed. The boards of Wellpoint and its parent Blue Cross of California are still evaluating a competing offer by Blue Shield of California which wants to buy Wellpoint. Blue Cross is not connected with Blue Shield in California."We are close" Dr. Hasan said "but it's not over until it's over."An H.M.O. owned by the Aetna Life and Casualty Company has had the contract since early last year. Aetna originally had a five-year $3.5 billion deal but it was cut back after the General Accounting Office in Washington criticized the way the contract was awarded. The unhappy losers at that time included Dr. Hasan's company Qual Med which later became part of Health Systems.The Pentagon contract will increase the Californians covered by Health Systems by at least 50 percent and add at least $25 million to the company's net income which was $88.5 million last year.Dr. Hasan said however that Wellpoint's profits had exceeded $200 million annually so in a merged Health Systems-Wellpoint $25 million "looks like a very small potato."

 0,The orchestra world’s Black Friday began on Sept. 30 with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra going on strike in the morning and ended across Pennsylvania that evening with the Philadelphia Orchestra walking out as patrons gathered for its opening-night gala. The Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra musicians who were already on strike sent their support on Twitter.But three strikes should not be taken to mean that classical music is out.While orchestras across the country face endemic challenges — rising costs and weakening demand along with difficulty raising money as classical music’s place in the broader culture fades — each ensemble has its own obstacles and its fortunes are often closely tied to its community’s. That is why some orchestras including the mighty Los Angeles Philharmonic and the small Grand Rapids Symphony which announced this year that it raised $40 million for its endowment are able to thrive while others struggle.“I think orchestras are fundamentally local businesses” said Thomas W. Morris who has led both the Cleveland Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Morris added that while the unions representing musicians tend to look at what their peers are paid at comparable orchestras across the country management typically focuses on what it thinks the local area can support.That is certainly the case in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Orchestra is one of America’s best ensembles known even to people who do not listen to much classical music for its playing in Walt Disney’s classic “Fantasia.” Seven seasons ago its base pay was higher than at the New York Philharmonic or the Boston Symphony Orchestra both in cities where the cost of living is substantially higher than in Philadelphia. Then the ensemble facing a fiscal crisis sought bankruptcy protection five years ago — betting that the ability to get rid of some of its pension obligations would outweigh any hit taken by its reputation. The musicians saw their pay cut by 14 percent and in the fiercely competitive orchestra world fell behind those peers and dropped to the eighth best-paid group in the nation where they remain according to Adaptistration a website that tracks orchestra compensation.

 9,Ted Shaker executive producer for sports at CBS saw the Schembechler clip on ESPN Saturday night and assigned aides to get permission to use it Sunday. ESPN confirmed that CBS got permission from ESPN but admits it should not have given it. ESPN had the tape because WXYZ had transmitted it to Detroit from Kentucky through ESPN equipment. Giving Due Credit''Channel 7 in Detroit was putting a hold on it but they inadvertently forgot to tell us that'' said Mike Bogad ESPN's assignment-desk manager.Shaker said credit was given to WXYZ at the end of the CBS basketball telecast Sunday. That was about the time Bob Lipson was leaving Charleston S.C. to fly home to Detroit after attending a bar mitzvah.Lipson president of CTC Sports Inc. in West Bloomfield Mich. produces Schembechler's television show on WXYZ and makes videotapes Michigan uses in recruiting.He saw the Schembechler clip on CBS at the airport and called CBS to get permission to use it. When he landed he learned that the tape was already his property. Under an agreement among WXYZ CTC Sports and Schembechler WXYZ sends a cameraman into the locker room after Michigan's football and basketball games to tape for CTC.WXYZ can use portions of CTC's tapes but only with permission of Lipson. WXYZ did not get such permission last weekend Lipson said.''It's our video not WXYZ's not CBS's not ESPN's'' Lipson said.Lipson said he would probably have allowed the clip to air on WXYZ but not on ESPN or CBS. The WXYZ sports producer John Cwikla said today that one of Lipson's assistants had given WXYZ permission.

 0,Josh Beckett was the last Red Sox player to reach the field before Game 1 of the division series against the Angels. Beckett was one of the first players to leave the field before the pregame drills were over. As Beckett entered and exited he did not speak to reporters about his strained oblique muscle.Beckett who is one of the best postseason pitchers of his generation was supposed to start the opener. But Beckett strained his oblique during a throwing session last Friday and is tentatively scheduled to pitch Game 3 on Sunday.While Manager Terry Francona has been optimistic about Beckett’s situation the Red Sox are still uncertain he will be able to pitch. Beckett has a bullpen session scheduled for Thursday’s off day. If Beckett throws without difficulties and does not have any trouble Friday he could start Sunday.Francona would not call Beckett “a lock” to start because he did not think that word was appropriate. After Beckett long tossed from 150 feet Wednesday Francona said the bigger test will come Thursday.“Now if everything goes O.K. he’ll throw his side tomorrow but we reserve the right to make a change if we don’t think it’s in his best interest physically” Francona said. “But he had a real good last couple of days and today was another good day.”If Beckett cannot pitch Boston would start Paul Byrd or the knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. Beckett was 4-0 with a 1.20 earned run average as the Red Sox rumbled to the World Series title last season. Not having Beckett at all would obviously impair Boston’s chances to repeat as champions.

 0,To the Editor:Although I support the military operation in Afghanistan the Oct. 29 photograph of four Afghan children being prepared for burial after an American airstrike is as haunting as some of the images from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against our country. The accompanying news article about more civilian deaths because of the airstrikes is equally disturbing.A dearth of obvious targets seems to be forcing the United States military to strike at marginal targets leading to the death of innocent civilians. No matter how much good will the United States' military operation enjoys if major military actions can't be justified the American people and their supporters around the world will see these actions as an illegitimate and unnecessary use of force.The government has prepared us for and we will accept a long and difficult war against terrorism. Now the United States government and the military should take their time and do it right.SALLY MACALarchmont N.Y. Oct. 29 2001
 0,More than 50 Special Operations troops have been active in the cave-riddled mountains of Tora Bora near Jalalabad. Some have been working with anti-Taliban Afghan militias who are searching through the caves for die-hard Al Qaeda members and intelligence documents. Other Americans including commandos and snipers have operated independently in their hunt for Al Qaeda warriors trying to escape into Pakistan.It was unclear which Americans were attacked today.In Kandahar Mr. Shirzai had been planning to send thousands of soldiers to begin a military campaign against the Taliban holdouts. But the plan was placed on hold late Sunday when Taliban commanders offered to surrender said Yusuf Pashtun a senior aide to Mr. Shirzai.''We have now canceled that plan'' Mr. Pashtun said this morning minutes before he left Kandahar for Helmand in a convoy that included the six American vehicles. The convoy stopped briefly in front of the house of Ahmed Karzai the brother and chief spokesman for Hamid Karzai the leader of Afghanistan's interim government.Afghan commanders said the Taliban had been given until Thursday to fulfill their surrender agreement.Sher Muhammad the governor of Helmand who was in Kandahar this morning said a force of Afghan soldiers and the American Special Forces troops were going to the towns of Musa Qala and Kajaki just south of Baghran. The Taliban were expected to surrender their weapons and vehicles in those towns before being allowed to return to their villages Mr. Muhammad said.Mr. Muhammad said the Taliban there are being led by a commander from the area named Abdul Waheed but better known as Rais Baghran. Mr. Muhammad added that the Taliban commander had insisted that Mullah Omar was not in Baghran an assertion that some anti-Taliban commanders seemed willing to believe.But Muhammad Zali another senior commander for Mr. Shirzai said the Taliban officials might be lying and buying time to allow Mullah Omar to escape. ''They will say anything'' Mr. Zali said. ''We cannot trust them. We have to search all the areas in Baghran to make sure Mullah Muhammad Omar is not there.''

 0,NEW ORLEANS — It is one thing to get the Alabama fans mad at you. It is quite another when the Alabama attorney general is mad and has the power to throw you in prison.Andre Smith the Outland Trophy winner has been suspended for the Sugar Bowl for what multiple news media outlets are reporting was improper contact with an agent. The Alabama attorney general’s office is investigating because the state has strict laws regarding sports agents and contact with amateur athletes. The offense is considered a felony.The story broke Monday when Coach Nick Saban announced Smith’s suspension and it did not take long for the Alabama attorney general to assign an investigator. Some news media outlets are reporting that a member of Smith’s family talked to the agent.The N.C.A.A. said it was not involved in the investigation and the university was handling the probe. That should not surprise critics of the N.C.A.A. who claim the governing body of college athletics has lost its teeth when it comes to chasing bad behavior by its members.This is bad news for the agent involved for several reasons. One is jail time and a hefty fine. Also consider that Alabama is going to have a slew of N.F.L.-type players in the program the next few seasons with Saban chasing the best of the best in recruiting. If an agent is responsible for Smith getting suspended it is likely that agent and his agency will not have a chance at these Bama players.The last time Alabama had to play a game without Smith its all-American left tackle the Crimson Tide stumbled around on offense and beat Tulane 20-6 in the third game of the season. Bama rushed for 130 yards. Alabama not only played without Smith who led one of the best offensive lines in the country it also played without right guard Marlon Davis. The sophomore David Ross will start against Utah at left guard and Mike Johnson will move from left guard to left tackle.Smith by the way told The Birmingham News he had not decided whether to turn pro or return for his senior season. Considering the life expectancy of knees in college football and the N.F.L. it is hard to believe Smith will not turn pro especially if he is projected to go in the top five of the 2009 draft as many expect.
 0,Romania and Bulgaria now the European Union’s poorest members hope that membership will help them raise per-capita wealth which is one-third of the union’s average. Their accession the union’s second wave of enlargement into the formerly Communist Eastern Europe also will give the union a stable political and economic anchor in a region surrounded by unstable neighbors.Romania with a population of about 22 million becomes the European Union’s seventh-largest member; it is about half the size of Poland but double the size of Hungary and Czech Republic. Bulgaria with a population of 7.7 million is far smaller.For Romania which suffered one of Eastern Europe’s most brutal Communist dictatorships under Nicolae Ceausescu before he was overthrown in 1989 being moored to the European Union marks an important symbolic final break with a difficult past. For Bulgaria whose history is marked by conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Soviet occupation union membership is also viewed as a source of economic and democratic stability.The entry of the Balkan countries comes as the European Union is experiencing expansion fatigue following the bloc’s enlargement in May 2004 from 15 countries to 25.With the latest additions the union has a population of nearly 489 million. It will work in 32 official languages ranging from Bulgarian to Gaelic while its Brussels bureaucracy will expand to encompass 27 European commissioners.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This has prompted some members like France to worry that the European Union will become economically overburdened institutionally unwieldy and ultimately unmanageable.The European Union’s cautious approach to further expansion was reflected in the toughest conditions ever imposed on union entrants including the creation of a what has been termed a nuclear option allowing the European Commission to delay the accession of Romania and Bulgaria if they fell behind on changes required for entry.Even now that they are in the union the two countries will be subject to unprecedented safeguards intended to keep them from backtracking. These include the commission’s power to suspend some of the rights that come with membership like generous economic aid. The commission also has threatened to suspend recognition of arrest warrants and decisions made by Bulgarian courts if the country does not improve judicial reforms.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyRomania expects to receive as much as 1.7 billion euros in the first year after entry while Bulgaria with a smaller population would be entitled to 661 million euros.The entry of the two countries comes as the European Union is grappling with fears that westward migration from its poorer members in the east risks undermining the bloc’s social standards. At the time of the union’s last enlargement in May 2004 the European Commission estimated that the number of migrants throughout the bloc would total 70000 to 150000 a year; in practice Britain alone is estimated to have received up to 600000 in the past three years.Consequently job-seekers from Romania and Bulgaria are likely to face stiff restrictions in the rest of the European Union. Britain Sweden and Ireland which opened their doors to union newcomers in 2004 have already signaled that they are less inclined to do so now. Romanians and Bulgarians may also face obstacles in labor markets in Hungary Slovakia and the Czech Republic which are themselves confronting restrictions by countries further west.At a recent summit meeting in Brussels union leaders toughened their tone on enlargement but stopped short of setting new hurdles to expansion. They reaffirmed backing for the eventual membership of Turkey and the western Balkan states: Albania Bosnia Croatia Macedonia Montenegro and Serbia.But they insisted that expansion could not proceed unless the union changed its outmoded institutions including a decision-making system in which national vetoes remain widespread.Romania and Bulgaria both economically liberal supporters of the United States as well as members of NATO are likely to fall into the European Union’s camp of countries with a bias against state protectionism. Analysts predict they will be less prone to divisiveness than newcomers like Poland because they will be eager to prove their European credentials to their new partners some of whom were wary of letting them in.

 0,PhotoDan Shefet doesn’t want you to Google his name.A Danish lawyer who has lived in Paris for 30 years Mr. Shefet has been accused online of professional malpractice fraud and even having connections to the Serbian mafia — accusations he strongly denies.“It’s been nightmarish. It’s affected my entire family” Mr. Shefet 60 said at his somewhat cluttered office in central Paris. “As a lawyer I live and die by my reputation.”So in 2013 Mr. Shefet asked Google to take down links to the defamatory material. The search engine complied but only on its French site meaning anyone outside France could still see the items in question.Then last year after Europe’s highest court ruled that anyone with connections to Europe could ask that links about themselves be removed from search results Mr. Shefet took a different approach.He sued Google’s French unit — citing the so-called right-to-be-forgotten decision — and asked a Paris court to force the company to remove the links not just in France but in all of the company’s global search engine domains.And he won — perhaps setting a precedent that the European ruling should apply far more broadly than originally understood.In the judgment for Mr. Shefet the French judge relied on a specific point of the recent privacy ruling that said a company’s local subsidiary could be held liable for the activities of its parent. The judge ordered Google’s French subsidiary to pay daily fines of roughly $1100 until links to the defamatory content were removed from all searches worldwide.“Google put up a hell of a fight. But they lost” Mr. Shefet said. “Now if Google doesn’t comply they will be fined.”Google says it has already removed the defamatory links from its search results in Europe and it argues that the Paris court’s decision does not specifically demand that the company’s non-European domains must comply with the judgment. Although Google is being fined no payments have been made.Still Mr. Shefet’s case has raised a central question about Europe’s data protections rules: How far can the Continent impose its own strict privacy laws on sites that operate outside Europe including those of Google Microsoft and Facebook?The ability for Europe to enforce the region’s privacy rules beyond its borders will be a major part of a report soon to be published by a committee set up by Google. The report expected to be released by mid-February will counsel the company on how to handle Europe’s right-to-be-forgotten standard. The company has complied with roughly 40 percent of the 760000 link-removal requests that it has received over the last eight months according to the company’s latest transparency report.The advisory group includes Jimmy Wales the founder of Wikipedia who has been a vocal opponent of the European privacy decision as well as a number of leading data protection academics.But after holding a number of public meetings across Europe the committee remains divided over whether Google should impose the right-to-be-forgotten decision on all of its global search results according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the report had yet to be completed.Despite the differing views however the majority of the group is expected to recommend that Europe’s standard should only apply within the 28-country bloc according to one of the people. That would support Google’s efforts to limit the privacy decision so that its search results outside the European Union would remain unaffected.“It’s our strong view that there needs to be some way of limiting the concept because it is a European concept” Google’s top lawyer David Drummond told an audience in Brussels in January referring to the right-to-be-forgotten ruling. “We’ve had a basic approach. We’ve followed it; on this question we’ve made removals Europewide but not beyond.”Google’s position has put it at odds with many of Europe’s privacy watchdogs which are concerned that people — both inside and outside Europe — can sidestep the region’s stringent privacy rules simply by using a non-European web address. While links on European sites like Google.fr and Google.de may be removed for example other domains like Google.com would not be affected.Already European regulators have issued guidelines calling on Google to apply the right-to-be-forgotten ruling to its entire search empire.And as people like Mr. Shefet increasingly take Google and others to court to force them to remove links from global search results the battle over whether people have the right to be forgotten online is set to intensify.“The European court’s judgment will have profound consequences” said Mr. Shefet who now advises others on how to demand that links to content be removed worldwide. “The floodgates have opened.”

 9,After seven months of stalemate at the bargaining table striking elevator constructors in this city have voted to go back to work under a contract only slightly different from the three‐year pacts a dozen other construction crafts accepted many months ago.The long tie‐up forced 50000 other building unionists into idleness and caused heavy losses to contractors and prospective tenants in high‐rise office and apartment buildings. One reason the stoppage lasted so long was the outrageous provision in the New York State Unemployment Insurance Law that puts employers in the position of having to help subsidize strikes against themselves.New York and Rhode Island are alone among the fifty states to permit strikers to draw unemployment insurance benefits; the funds out of which the benefits come are built up exclusively through employer taxes. An estimated $2 million in benefits was paid to strikers during the various stages of the marathon construction stoppage.This latest evidence of the perversion of unemployment insurance into a spur for union intransigence in collective bargaining ought finally awaken the State Legislature to the need for amending the law to end a strike subsidy that contributes neither to justice nor to industrial peace.
 0,June is a month of weddings and graduations leaving men with the challenge of dressing appropriately without succumbing to the heat. Here we present five lightweight solutions to this annual sartorial dilemma.The Jeffrey Rüdes label offers a linen suit in black that works for any festive summer occasion. “Guys need a more natural feeling about their formal jackets and that comes with softer construction” said Mr. Rüdes who started his namesake brand in 2015.Another warm-weather option is available from Ralph Lauren: a gossamer-like formal sport coat in silk with silk pants. Hermès achieves a similar feel through a different fabric with an unlined cotton-and-jersey jacket so thin that it’s almost sheer.From the British designer Margaret Howell comes a linen shawl-collar jacket with a boxy cut. Its distinctive shape suggests a nonchalant formality and pairing it with a silky pajama shirt emphasizes the effect. The single-breasted linen and wool blazer and pants from Berluti are especially relaxed and easy to wear as well.

 0,Admit it: You’ve always wanted Carmen Electra to wish you a happy birthday. Or maybe not. But she is going to be at the ready just in case.Beginning on Monday a start-up called Cameo Stars will try to hop aboard the social media gravy train by selling video greetings from celebrities and athletes on Facebook . For $3 for instance you can buy a video of Drew Brees  the New Orleans Saints quarterback holding a piece of birthday cake. With a click you can post that video on a friend’s page.“Hey I heard it’s your birthday” Mr. Brees says in the video. “I made this cake just for you. Have a great one.”Stars get a royalty and record videos for various occasions. (Certain videos will be free or priced at $1.)Cameo Stars has had more luck signing up prominent athletes than A-list actors so far — Tony Romo and Reggie Bush have signed on — but Daren Hornig the company’s chief executive promises that more movie and television personalities are on the way.“It’s a new way to build their brands and connect with fans” Mr. Hornig said adding that the offering will be introduced on iPhones and other social networks later. His ambitions are big: Cameo Stars thinks it can sell “a few million” of Mr. Romo’s videos alone.

After graduatingMs. Wheeler was interviewed by 19 investment banks but decided to start her fantasy business instead.Eleven months ago she opened the Kimberly Gallery in the SoHo section of Manhattan which she says is New York's only art gallery for children. "I specialize in alternative art forms for children as well as in children's book illustrations" she said.The gallery carries two lines of children's furniture. Each piece of Tracey Belfatto's multi-functional furniture incorporates a blackboard and an abacus. Rob Johnson's line is high-tech: all glass and black steel. "It's very much for the SoHo baby" Ms. Wheeler said.There are some wonderful small items including at near right an early 1900's illustration by Arthur Rackham ($140) and at far right a hand-painted giraffe ($130) and a rabbit clock ($120).

 0,Robert Caplin for The New York TimesCharles Barkley is not a fan of Michael Jordan’s tenure as owner and chief decision-maker for the Charlotte Bobcats.“I love Michael but he just has not done a good job” Barkley said on “The Waddle & Silvy Show” on Thursday. “Even though he is one of my great friends I can’t get on here and tell you he’s done a great job. He has not done a great job plain and simple.”Barkley even got specific saying that his teammate on the 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team erred in taking Gonzaga’s Adam Morrison over Washington’s Brandon Roy with the third pick in the 2006 draft.“I said ‘Michael I think you should take Brandon Roy and he said ‘We like Adam Morrison’ ” Barkley said. “I said ‘Adam Morrison can’t play.’ ”Barkley may have had a point as Morrison averaged 7.5 points and 2.1 rebounds in 161 N.B.A. games before heading overseas while Roy averaged 19 points and 4.7 assists a game in 321 games before injuries prematurely ended his career.It’s possible however that Jordan simply saw in Morrison an ability to win championship rings regardless of his actual basketball talent. While Morrison was unable to match Jordan’s six rings he did win two as a bench player for the Lakers. For all of Barkley’s talent he never managed even one.Follow Benjamin Hoffman on Twitter @NYTCloseUp

 9,A Federal law intended to restrict paroles for violent felons has become a stumbling block in state budget negotiations with Gov. George E. Pataki and the Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver trading accusations of dishonesty and competing interpretations of the law.Strictly speaking it is not a budget matter. The state stands to lose $24 million this year in Federal aid for prison construction if it does not comply with Federal parole guidelines passed last year that require violent offenders to serve on average at least 85 percent of their sentences. But that is a pittance next to the $635 million the Governor wants to spend this year on new prison space let alone the $66 billion budget. State officials say New York has until Tuesday night to apply for the Federal grant.Nor is it strictly speaking a matter of how much time prisoners serve. A state with prisoners serving relatively short sentences can qualify for the Federal grant if it denies all paroles while another state that grants paroles might not qualify even if its prisoners serve longer terms.Mr. Pataki a Republican insists that the state has not met the Federal standard and that it ought to deny parole to all first-time violent felons. Mr. Silver a Democrat from Manhattan says he believes that the state qualifies. And the Justice Department says the answer is unclear.
 9,This year's market has been adept at defying skeptics. After shrugging off summer doldrums stocks have made substantial gains over the last three months. The Dow has returned 9.6 percent since Sept. 30 with stocks like Philip Morris American Express and I.B.M. posting returns above 20 percent. Even the jitters caused earlier last month by remarks by Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve chairman seem to have been forgotten as investors who continue to put money into the market after declines are rewarded. ''It has reinforced investor confidence'' Mr. Kaufman said.Not everybody had as much reason to celebrate of course. Large-company stocks were the clear favorites during the year as investors sought the security and safety of well-known names in large multinational companies like Coca-Cola as protection against the whims of the economy. Small stocks as measured by the Russell 2000 index fared less well after this summer's downturn. The Russell ended 1996 up 14.76 percent to close at 362.61 -- near where it was trading in May.The year's exuberance has made some pause and wonder. ''Investors have to be very happy'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''They're surprised shocked and a little concerned because they didn't expect this and don't know what to make of it.''And as they did at the end of 1995 some experts are warning investors not to expect more of the same. The last decade has blessed stocks with all the right ingredients: the slashing of interest rates and inflation tax-cutting and the fattening of corporate profit margins Mr. Micheletti noted adding ''A lot of forces behind the bull market are mature long in tooth and unlikely to repeat.''Still investors may not want to make the kind of contrarian bets that have paid off in the past. While some are betting on a resurgence in smaller stocks which showed some signs of occurring early in December these stocks may not be outperformers in 1997.''The economy is brutal in terms of competitiveness'' said Thomas McManus a strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company who cautions investors not to discount the strength of large companies which have proved more profitable than some of their smaller counterparts.The market's future remains murky even as yesterday's decline was a reminder of just how anxious investors are. While some forecasters say the economy could heat up enough to warrant interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve others are convinced that the economy is slowing down. ''People have been swinging back and forth on the economy'' Mr. Kaufman said.

 0,For the past three and a half years Republicans have struggled to explain a great conundrum. If they are the party of authentic America with a mystical connection to the will of the people then how exactly did Barack Obama get elected president?Some Republicans have come up with an answer that allows them to avoid facing the unpleasant reality of their own party’s failures: Obama must be a great deceiver. He won the White House by subterfuge.Claims that Obama concealed nonnative birth or faith in Islam failed to gain mainstream traction but conservatives like Sean Hannity were more successful in labeling Obama as covertly “anti-American” based on his association with the incendiary pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. By this logic Obama was a paragon of Christian piety. He “savored” every word on Sunday mornings and would surely govern by these traitorous principles: his beliefs were dangerous because well he really believed them.Now his critics have reversed course: they say Obama is a sham Christian. He thinks religion is not heartfelt belief that demands full expression but only a matter of showing up at church. He is not the first president to stand so accused: in the election of 1800 one clergyman charged Thomas Jefferson with “disbelief of the Holy Scriptures” and Abraham Lincoln battled the suggestion that he was a “scoffer of Christianity.”But Obama’s opponents have a new twist on this old allegation. They find evidence for his unbelief not by exposing his biblical illiteracy or shoddy church attendance but in his failure to support “religious freedom.”Religious freedom is as American as apple pie isn’t it? How could anyone oppose it? Because — this line of reasoning goes — Obama is not who he says he is. He claims to be a true Christian and a true American but his actions prove otherwise.The charge that the president is a faker on religious freedom is the most recent iteration of the ongoing attack on his legitimacy: it is the new “birther” movement. It’s also a decades-old rhetorical tool of the culture wars intended to depict the entire left as frauds who supposedly stand for a tolerant open society but who are in fact disciples of a secular pseudo-religion intent on quashing Christian influence in America.The Rev. Franklin Graham who has always been more provocative than his prudent father Billy told MSNBC last week that the president lacks sufficient outrage over the plight of persecuted Christians. “Islam has gotten a free pass under Obama” Graham said adding that the Muslim world sees Obama as “a son of Islam” who will not challenge religious oppression. “The Muslims of the world — he seems to be more concerned about them than the Christians that are being murdered in the Muslim countries – that’s what bothers me.” (Graham offered a half-apology on Tuesday saying he regretted any comments that “cast any doubt on the personal faith of our president.”)During the recent outcry over the Obama administration’s new rule requiring religious employers to cover birth control in their insurance plans Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney blasted the president too: here was proof of Obama’s aim to oppress religious expression and trample constitutional rights.Last week at a rally at a Christian college in Michigan Rick Santorum called the president “particularly weak” on religious freedom. He insisted that “freedom of religion” is much more than “freedom of worship” confined within a church’s four walls which even “tyrants” support. “When you have the president of the United States referring to freedom of religion and you have the secretary of state referring to the freedom of religion not as the freedom of religion but the freedom of worship you should get very very nervous” he warned.When conservatives cry “freedom of religion” and insist they mean something more than “freedom of worship” this is what they mean: religious freedom is not just the freedom to gather in a room and pray one morning a week. It is the freedom to impose one’s own religious values on others. Free expression of religion entails the right to reason from religious principles in the public square and — with sufficient electoral support — to enshrine those principles in law and social institutions. If Obama does not support this view they argue then he is hardly a true American.Over the course of American history “religious freedom” has been a shape-shifter invoked just as often in the name of prejudice (in 19th-century Protestant campaigns against Catholic schools; in fundamentalist colleges’ racial discrimination a hundred years later) as on behalf of liberty. It is a code phrase alternately benign and sinister much like that other clever cloak for bigotry “states’ rights.” In the context of the 2012 race the charge that Obama subverts religious freedom is a code meant to label the president as an impostor a blasphemer of the American gospel who adheres to another religion entirely.Santorum has hit this theme the hardest warning that conservative Christians must not be fooled by the president’s efforts to play the neutral statesman who treats all believers equally. On the contrary he obeys a false religion with nonnegotiable assumptions of its own. Santorum described Obama’s environmentalism as a “phony theology” and a “worldview.”This is an attempt to paint as irrationally ideological a president who has proven himself to be not very ideological at all (much to the frustration of his supporters on the left). It is a culture warrior’s maneuver to cast American politics as a Manichean battleground between two worldviews — red-blooded Christian America pitted against the secularist stranger — worldviews so captive to their own logic that they cannot possibly compromise on anything.This obsession with “worldviews” has been a favorite tactic of the Christian right. In the 1970s Francis Schaeffer and other activists taught evangelicals to organize against the “secular humanist worldview” that was denaturing America’s Christian values in an acid bath of “humanist religion” “an exclusivist closed system which shuts out all contending viewpoints” (that’s the “phony theology” that Santorum was talking about).Schaeffer’s admirers often note that he defends religious freedom in his 1981 book “A Christian Manifesto.” But after Schaeffer called for “general religious freedom” for all faiths he went on to lament the left’s manipulation of the First Amendment to encourage a “new concept of pluralism” in which “there is no right or wrong; it is just a matter of your personal preference.”To recover America’s biblical foundation Christians had to “do battle on the entire front:” not just in church but in the courts classrooms outside abortion clinics and everywhere else Schaeffer wrote. The emerging Christian right asserted that this was the true meaning of “religious freedom” in America: freedom to institutionalize Christian dogma in American society and law. Freedom of religion — a phrase that sounds at first blush like a bipartisan nod to our common political heritage — is a weapon of culture war.Slogans like this have political power. Voters on both the right and the left have little sympathy for politicians who reason through problems and recognize ambiguity (conservatives won’t forgive Romney for his honest struggles with the abortion issue and Obama faces liberal wrath for his nuanced approach to economic recovery). Wonkish debates are boring and complicated and not very good for separating the sheep from the goats. What matters are your “presuppositions” your “worldview.”Conservatives’ accusations that Obama disrespects religious freedom have little to do with the White House’s actual policy: his administration has a strong track record in supporting faith-based organizations and ensuring that prisoners have access to religious literature for example. They have everything to do with resurrecting old challenges to the president’s legitimacy and framing the 2012 campaign as a battle between honest Christian Americans and atheist subversives. “Enemy of religious freedom” is shorthand for a deceiver who is not one of us: in Gingrich’s words one who “played a wonderful con as a result of which he is now president.”Molly Worthen teaches religious history at the University of Toronto.

 0,To the Editor:While Daniel Libeskind's design has admirable intentions is it a fitting tribute to America's darkest day (front page Feb. 27)?It is striking that none of the proposed designs for the new trade center were ''bigger and better than before.'' That was the initial emotional response after the attack.The best tribute to the 3000 people who lost their lives and to the spirit of America would be to rebuild a trade center fitting to our spirit. One that echoes all our voices. One that is not compromised by terror.And in my hope one that is bigger and better than before.JOHN PUPONSNew York Feb. 27 2003
 9,To the Editor:''Gateway to Madness'' (editorial March 29) differentiates ''cults'' from ''mainstream faiths'' by citing the lack of ancient roots of the cults.Not all mainstream faiths have ancient roots. The Mormon religion for example was founded in 1830. It should also be recognized that all religions began their existence as cults and they were all subject to derision and persecution. Their eventual acceptance as ''religions'' was achieved only when they acquired some form of political power.MANNY HILLMANBlue Point L.I. March 30 1997

 9,Two polls published several weeks earlier had shown similar divergences.The candidates themselves like most of their supporters see the race developing in something close to even terms.''I see it very close with me a little bit ahead'' said Mr. Bond.Mark Ulven Mrs. Woods's press secretary said: ''Our own polling shows the race a dead heat. I really believe the momentum has shifted our way.'' Vast Differences in CandidatesThe candidates themselves show differences as great both in personalities and in backgrounds as the polling results.Mr. Bond 47 years old the son of a middle-Missouri manufacturing family and a graduate of Princeton University has the more privileged background of the two. But he exhibits a manner that as one expert put it the other day ''is not too urbane not too folksy just professional.''He finished first in his law school class at the University of Virginia became a clerk for a Federal appeals court in Atlanta and worked for a Washington law firm before returning to Missouri.Back home he started early and near the top in politics running for Congress at the age of 29. He lost that race but in 1970 at the age of 31 he upset an entrenched incumbent to become State Auditor. Two years later he was elected Governor a post in which he faced repeated conflicts with Democratic legislative majorities. He was defeated in a race for re-election in 1976 but ran successfully for a second term in 1980. Former Newspaper ReporterMrs. Woods 59 a candidate who often seems to captivate audiences (''I hate the word charisma but she has it'' said one analyst who has followed her campaign.) is a native of Cleveland and a graduate of the University of Michigan who first came to Missouri as a newspaper reporter in St. Louis. Her first political race at the age of 40 was for membership on the City Council of University City a St. Louis suburb.

 0,The economy of Hong Kong continued to stagnate in the first quarter with output falling nine-tenths of a percent from a year earlier near the low end of economists' expectations. A small increase in exports of services notably a big jump in tourists from mainland China failed to offset record unemployment of 7 percent and sinking exports of goods. But the economy fared slightly better than it did in the fourth quarter when output shrank 1.4 percent compared with a year earlier.Keith Bradsher (NYT)

In the new policy Amazon disclosed that it has started sending e-mail marketing messages on behalf of other companies. It also added a long list of data it collects about users including financial information Social Security numbers product searches and the telephone number from which a user calls Amazon's customer service line. And for the first time Amazon disclosed it can buy information about customers from outside databases. And if the new initiatives do not help stem Amazon's huge losses and the company is put up for sale the new policy says anyone who buys Amazon will get its customer data. Saul Hansell (NYT)
 9,UNITED STATES GYPSUM is back. Of course its products were never gone but the industrial company that made big profits in the mid-80's fell out of favor with many investors after 1988. That year it borrowed $2.5 billion to pay the holder of each of its shares of stock a $42 dividend to ward off a takeover bid.The debt coupled with a steep drop in construction activity and lower demand for gypsum products was too great a burden. In January 1991 USG the holding company for United States Gypsum and other divisions that was created in a 1985 reorganization defaulted on bond payments.After taking two years or so to reorganize on a more solid financial footing USG emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month minus $1.4 billion of debt. Interest charges were reduced to $170 million a year from $320 million.So far the new company has not aroused much enthusiasm among investors. It began trading on May 21 at $11 a share on the New York Stock Exchange and closed Friday at $10. At that price analysts say the shares are a good value even though the company is a long way from regaining its financial health of the early- and mid-80's.

 9,STRING QUARTET NO. 13 (OP. 130). Vegh Quartet (Valois Auvidis V 4407).PIANO SONATAS NOS. 28 TO 32; "DIABELLI" VARIATIONS; BAGATELLES (OP. 126). Artur Schnabel pianist (Pearl GEMM CDS 9142; three CD's).FIVE works five Beethovens: the orchestral revolutionary of the "Eroica" Symphony the choral-orchestral visionary of the Missa Solemnis the generous lyricist of the "Archduke" Trio the cryptic poet of the Opus 130 Quartet the mercurial experimenter of the "Diabelli" Variations. Loyalty to my first musical love demands representation of the "Eroica" but otherwise my choices lean more toward the private elusive sides of Beethoven's all-embracing personality.For my money Otto Klemperer remains the conductor of Beethoven. His life an indomitable progress through mishaps and catastrophes echoed Beethoven's own. The power that emanated from this towering unbalanced brilliant man is reflected in one of his finest EMI recordings the Missa Solemnis. The trademark slow tempos rocklike beats and oratorical phrasings are not merely an assertion of conductorial will. Klemperer's fundamental straightforwardness places the original score first and foremost. Power cancels itself out; burning belief in the music remains.Klemperer's "Eroica" would have headed my list but EMI has mystifyingly exiled it to a boxed set. In its place I would recommend Toscanini's pulse-quickening live performance from 1939 reissued on an RCA mid-price disk. (Note also a strong "Eroica" in Herbert von Karajan's generally satisfying Beethoven cycle from 1963; Deutsche Grammophon's box of the nine symphonies can be had for $40 or less.)Alfred Cortot Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals singing through the "Archduke" Trio present a Beethoven vastly different from either Klemperer's or Toscanini's. Here music melts into civilized conversation smiling asides dreaming digressions. This is the world from which Schubert was born and a buoyant reading of Schubert's B flat Trio logically follows. The 1928 recording is highly listenable in French EMI's digital transfer: the distinctive poetic qualities of each artist come through with Casals's imperturbably noble tone at the heart of the sound.

 0,Another day another set of insider trading charges — this time revolving around two buddies accused of illicitly trading in MedImmune.The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Stephen R. Goldfield a former hedge fund manager with illegally making a $14 million profit from trading in MedImmune before its takeover by AstraZenca.Also charged was James W. Self Jr. an executive at an unnamed pharmaceutical company accused of tipping off his friend Mr. Goldfield about MedImmune’s intentions to sell itself. Both men settled the charges.According to the S.E.C.’s complaint Mr. Self learned through his company that MedImmune was looking to sell itself — because his employer was thinking about making a bid. He then tipped Mr. Goldfield a classmate at the the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania about MedImmune’s intentions.Around April 2007 Mr. Self told Mr. Goldfield that the “weather was in the 50s” a coded reference to his employer’s likelihood of making a bid for MedImmune in the $50-a-share range.Mr. Goldfield subsequently bought 17000 call options and 255000 common shares in MedImmune.AstraZeneca ultimately ended up buying MedImmune for $58 a share.In their settlements neither man admitted or denied guilt. Mr. Goldfield agreed to a permanent injunction by the S.E.C. and to pay $600000 of a proposed $16.6 million in disgorged profits and interest. Mr. Self agreed to pay a $50000 fine.Go to S.E.C.

 9,The Arkansas law firm in which Hillary Rodham Clinton and several senior Administration officials were partners violated conflict-of-interest rules in representing a savings association at the center of the Whitewater investigation Federal regulators said today.In a summary report prepared by the Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation investigators said the firm the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock had failed to disclose a conflict involving Webster L. Hubbell's representation of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association after it was seized by the Government.Mr. Hubbell was a Rose partner until he left to become the Associate Attorney General in 1993. The report by the F.D.I.C. found that while Mr. Hubbell represented the regulators he had failed to disclose that he had also been involved in a lawsuit brought against Madison by Seth Ward his father-in-law. Mr. Ward's company POM Inc. had borrowed significant amounts from Madison.The report also found $156286 in questionable billings by the Rose Firm.A different Government audit by the Resolution Trust Corporation covering a period that overlaps with that in today's report has questioned about $446000 in billings by the firm.

 9,Swimming heads the list of 40 participant sports in a survey taken in 1987 by the National Sporting Goods Association. More than 66 million Americans took the plunge last year and swimming was followed in the poll by exercise walking (58.1 million) which drew the most new participants (7.2 million).A participant is defined as someone 7 years of age or older who plays a sport more than once during a year.

 9,To its enormous credit the Bolshoi Opera chose boldness over mere middlebrow prudence. After Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin" last week the company could have continued along the same safe path with say "Boris Godunov" and "The Queen of Spades." Instead on Friday night at the Metropolitan Opera House it offered a real rarity Rimsky-Korsakov's opera-ballet "Mlada" to be followed on Wednesday by Tchaikovsky's almost equally rare "Maid of Orleans."Such repertory along with younger singers less known in the West than some older Bolshoi standbys represents a deliberate choice by the Moscow company's current leadership in place since 1988: Aleksandr Lazarev the artistic director and chief conductor; Boris Pokrovsky stage director and Valery Levental designer. They want to rediscover lost Russian masterpieces enliven stodgy production styles and showcase young talent.All noble aims but lamentably noble aims don't automatically translate into artistic success. Like the other two stagings presented here this "Mlada" is a direct product of the leading troika even though on Friday Mr. Lazarev was still fulfilling a prior commitment in Duisburg Germany of all unlikely places. First seen in Moscow in 1988 and presented to acclaim in Glasgow last summer the production seemed a muddled failure colorful refreshingly unliteral but profoundly confused. If the Russians don't take their own exotica seriously they can hardly expect Westerners to do so.Rimsky himself called his score "cold -- like ice." On Friday it seemed more lukewarm -- like mush. The whole enterprise score and production both with clumsily juxtaposed elements and fussy distancing devices -- along with the inexplicable absence of supertitles which will be used in the Bolshoi performances at Wolf Trap near Washington next week -- diluted the vibrant aspects of the piece canceling them out in confusion.

 9,Less than a year after Oregon voters turned down the strongest measure against gay rights that was ever considered by a state proponents of the measure have come right back with several election victories at the local level.In a two-week election by mail whose ballots were counted Tuesday night all of the four largely rural counties and two small towns that voted on the issue approved by lopsided margins a somewhat toned-down version of last fall's statewide measure which would have deemed homosexuality "abnormal and perverse" and allowed discrimination against homosexuals.The four counties -- Josephine Douglas Linn and Klamath -- and the two towns Junction City and Canby had been chosen by anti-gay forces that undertook petition drives leading to the voting because residents there had strongly backed the state measure. In the six elections combined approximately 90000 people cast votes. The entire state has a population of just under 3 million.The initiatives approved on Tuesday prohibit local governments from doing anything to "promote" homosexuality and bar laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination.

 9,On the fourth full day of camp Coach Joe Walton came up with yet another variation today in his attempt to change his philosophy about coaching the Jets. For the first time so early in training camp the players worked out in shorts and T-shirts rather than long pants and heavy pads this morning. They returned to regular gear for the afternoon session.Walton said with all the changes the team is making on defense he had not had time to work on the nickel defense or at blitzing.The Jets continue to be hampered by slight muscle pulls with the strong safety Russell Carter and the cornerback Bobby Jackson being the latest victims. Both missed practice this morning and although they went out on the field with the rest of the team for the afternoon session they did not do any work. ''The fast guys will have trouble with little muscle pulls'' Walton said between practice sessions.The coach said Joe Fields the center suffered separated ribs in Tuesday's practice and would miss the first exhibition game Aug. 10 at Giants Stadium against the Philadelphia Eagles.
 9,His doctor warned Joe Torre that his rate of recovery from prostate cancer would be unpredictable that he could feel strong and vigorous one day and weary the next. Whereas Torre once thought he might assume his role of manager on the Yankees' current road trip he said today that he was not ready and used two weeks as a time frame for his return.It could be sooner it could be later: Torre still finding himself tired at day's end in the seventh week since his surgery said he might manage next week hopes he'll be back by the All-Star Game break and is sure he'll manage again this year. The exact date? ''I don't know when I'm going to manage'' said Torre who watched the Kansas City Royals beat the Yankees 13-6 tonight for the first time since Aug. 12 1997.Don Zimmer continues to manage the Yankees in Torre's absence in spite of the pain in his knees and in spite of the fact that he called a team meeting earlier this week to inform players he would retire after yesterday's game. ''I'll be here until he decides to come back'' said Zimmer who answered questions alongside Torre today. ''Whether it be a day a month five weeks.''Said Torre: ''Why don't you ask me again in two weeks -- that's what I'm thinking about and if it's ahead of that then it would be a nice pleasant surprise for me. I've never been through this so I don't know what the timetable would be.''
 0,There were political neophytes and students of foreign policy onetime Republicans and lifelong Democrats.There were bankers and lawyers and probably a few sons of bankers and sons of lawyers too. The only thing missing were the Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.Welcome to Obama Singles Night in East Midtown where a beer was $8 and a mixed drink $12.Barack Obama probably wasn’t thinking of this crowd at The Grand on East 58th Street — a gathering of several hundred young professionals who are supporting him — when he made a pitch during Thursday night’s debate for health care that would give poor families more options than the emergency room. But they ate it up anyway.They also went nuts every time CNN zoomed in on one of the many celebrities in the audience like Stevie Wonder or Pierce Brosnan. But mostly they were cheering for Mr. Obama.If nothing else the crowd on Thursday night at The Grand on 58th Street on Manhattan’s East Side was diverse — socially ethnically politically and professionally. And while Mr. Obama was their man they clearly had wrestled with the decision.“He was like my favorite college professor and she was like my dominating mother” said Clair Kenny a 24-year-old city employee who added that it was not an easy choice deciding to support Mr. Obama over Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. “I think as a woman you don’t see many feminine role models as inspirational as Hillary. And that’s tempting. But Obama is closer to what I believe in and that transcends gender.”Said Jacob Buchdahl 35 a lawyer who was undecided until September: “Look Hillary is brilliant and accomplished and highly knowledgeable about the issues. But as far as who inspires you as a leader I don’t think it’s even close.”Mr. Buchdahl said he was torn partly because the first vote he cast was for Bill Clinton. But in the end he said Mr. Obama reminded him more of Mr. Clinton’s spark and enthusiasm than Mrs. Clinton did.Some were not even sure they were voting for Mr. Obama.“Barack seems to be kind of trendy right now so that’s what attracted me” said Valerie Thertus 22 a medical student whose intense academic schedule has left her with little time to read up on presidential politics. Thursday was one of here rare nights out.“It’s Barack-mania right now” she said “and I just wanted to know more about what’s going on.”And not everyone could even vote. “I’m Canadian” responded James Nidd 30 a banker when asked which candidate he was supporting.In theory he said he would vote for Mr. Obama. So why bother to come if you can’t vote? “The outcome of this election” Mr. Nidd said “affects the entire world.”Read more Primary Journal blog entries from the New York region.
 9,Unusually spirited and rythmically alert Bach playing was the unifying thread of a stimulating organ recital by Kei Koito at the Church of St. John the Evangelist Monday evening.Miss Koito played four works of the Thomaskantor - an early Vivaldi concerto transcription (BWV 593) the canonic variations on ''Vom Himmel hoch'' (BWV 769) the Trio Sonata in C minor (BWV 526) and the Prelude and Fugue in E flat (BWV 552) - with brilliant contrasts of registration (almost but never quite gaudy) and with a motoric swing that sometimes called to mind the Bach interpretations of Glenn Gould. Miss Koito is by no means alone in her application of a lean often non legato style to these works but her presentation of it was particularly fresh.She played the adagio of the Vivaldi arrangement with a blunt measured tread and hollow timbres; the variations brought singing fluency and deft ornamentation. The big final piece began with majestic pacing but in a way that remained relatively brisk and bright; the fugue was begun in severe colors that gave way to a sort of crescendo of registrational variety.Interspersed with the Bach were three new pieces all of them announced as New York premieres. Henri Pousseur's ''Deuxieme Vue sur les Jardins Interdits'' explored contrasts of timbre and confrontations of dissonance with pastiche consonance; it seemed limited by a stop-and-go character. Episodic construction though did not undermine the charm of Eric Gaudibert's ''Jetees'' a partly aleatory work of great variety; my favorite section was one in which pretty tweety high beepings cavorted with an Alberich-like bassoon stop below. Giacinto Scelsi's ''In Nomine Lucis'' built wild-sounding tone clusters into a vague chaotic climax and dwindled; it sounded primitive but stirring.

 0,PhotoSATURDAY PUZZLE — When last we saw Erin Rhode she was making her debut almost exactly one year ago with a wonderfully fun and lively Friday puzzle.Ms. Rhode returns today and it makes me insanely happy to see a woman contributing strong themeless puzzles to the queue. Welcome back Ms. Rhode.I love the fact that the colloquialism I CAN’T EVEN makes its debut today right beside PASS A TEST which is hilarious if you read them together. In addition FOOD COMA AND I’M OUT RED VINES and REPAYABLE make their debuts.Tricky Clues– 1A: For some reason I conflated “postprandial” with “drunk out of one’s head” and wrote in HANGOVER for the clue “Postprandial woe.” Just goes to show you. Postprandial means after one has eaten and the answer is the very lively FOOD COMA.– 43A: ENA was Bambi’s aunt in the Disney film.– 49A: I love oyster crackers even without the chowder but that’s not what the clue was going for today. With the question mark at the end of the clue we need to rethink the meaning of the word “crackers.” You know who cracks and eats oysters? OTTERS. Clever animals those OTTERS. They open them with a rock. In fact here’s one eating a clam:– 64A: There are so many ways to show one’s feelings. You could send flowers write a nice note. But if you’re going to display a small show of feelings which is the key phrase here you might use an EMOTICON.– 5D: Roman numerals in puzzles. Devilish especially when it’s clued vaguely like “10th-century year.” So how do you solve it? Take heart in the fact that you already know that the first Roman numeral is going to be C because of the clue. Then solve 15- and 16A to get CMI or 901.– 11D: SAT flashback time! A pride is a group of lions and you are being asked for the collective name for toads. Pride : lions :: KNOT : toads.– 35D: The clue “Old dope?” is not looking for the village idiot. The “old” in today’s clue which is very clever means that you are being asked for an old form of the word “dope.” Back in the day people used the word RAD (short for “radical!”) to mean “dope.”– 41D: When you’re working “blue” you’re working with racy or dirty material. A “blue book” in today’s puzzle is not a test booklet but SMUT.Let’s hear all about the puzzle from Ms. Rhode herself:Constructor’s NotesI’m very excited to show off my second-ever New York Times crossword puzzle just over one year from my first one. Perhaps I will make this an annual tradition. For all my friends and family who complained that my first puzzle ran on a Friday and they can never solve Fridays well … now is your chance to tackle a Saturday instead! It has been pointed out to me that I am the first female constructor to write a Saturday puzzle since 2014. For those who are excited because a female constructor surely means fewer sports references … sorry. I was really excited when I got “AL East” in there as an atonement for including “ALers” last time which I am well aware is a term that has been used in the real world by pretty much zero real baseball fans of which I am very much one. A resident of Oakland I had originally envisioned 32A to be an additional sports reference (my probably-too-hard clue: “Curry for one”) and even when I submitted the puzzle back in October assumed that it would be in reference to the 2016 N.B.A. Champions … but alas. It’s fine. Cleveland was due. And contrary to popular belief my hometown of Minneapolis did *not* take over the longest professional sports championship drought; thank you very much Minnesota Lynx. However as much as I could ramble on about sports none of the sports words were actually the seeds. FOOD COMA and BABY BUMP (which morphed into BABY MAMA when I decided that ESPNS was too much of a stretch even though there seems to be 17 different ESPNs these days) were my first seeds in opposing corners. ALONE TIME (which would have been a debut at the time I submitted) and I CAN’T EVEN were the seeds in the other corners. At one point in the lower left I had REPLY ALLS (as in “This e-mail thread has too many unnecessary reply-alls”) before deciding that like ESPN that wasn’t really a noun that should be pluralized. The less interesting — but more legit — REPAYABLE replaced it. After the seeds I was pretty happy that the middle section gluing the four corners turned out some nice entries as well. I hadn’t attempted a grid quite this open in the middle before and was delighted to get the aforementioned sports entries as well as ROT GUT and PEN NAME to fall out. Finally as I wrote the puzzle last fall my clue for 46-across was obviously different. (I believe I referred to the Curious George authors.) But I’m pretty excited that Will went the Star Wars route here. Rey was my favorite of the new characters.A very enjoyable Saturday outing Ms. Rhode. Come back soon.Your thoughts?

 9,The three-day symposium which has been meeting in private since Thursday is part of what Pope John Paul today called a general ''examination of conscience'' that is necessary as Christianity prepares to celebrate its third millennium. Its purpose which is more theological than historical is to examine Christian thought for prejudice against Judaism as well as against Jews.In the text of the Pope's comments made public by the Vatican John Paul joined other Roman Catholic theologians in acknowledging that by blaming the Jews for the death of Jesus certain Christian teachings had helped fuel anti-Semitism.''In the Christian world -- I do not say on the part of the church as such -- the wrong and unjust interpretations of the New Testament relating to the Jewish people and their presumed guilt circulated for too long contributing to feeling of hostility toward these people'' he said.''These contributed to soothing consciences'' the Pope said ''to the point that when a wave of persecutions swept Europe fueled by a pagan anti-Semitism -- which in its essence was equal to anti-Christianism -- next to those Christians who did everything to save the persecuted at the risk of their own lives the spiritual resistance of many was not that which humanity expected from the disciples of Christ.''During the 19 years of his pontificate John Paul has made significant progress in improving relations between the the Catholic Church and Jews. Today he again emphasized the common heritage that binds Christians and Jews. Those who consider Jesus' Jewish heritage as a ''simple cultural accident'' he said do a disservice to history and to Christianity.

 9,The specialties of Pizzeria Las Americas 40-05 Junction Boulevard (Roosevelt Avenue) Corona Queens are neither the typical kinds of pizza nor the latest designer styles. They are pizzas with a Hispanic flavor.The sausage pizza is made with chorizo for example. Another is made with ham and pimento and the spicy eggplant pizza comes with a layer of ham. The only variety not made with either ham or chorizo is the onion pizza which does not contain tomato either. A two-crust pizza gallega great to take on a picnic is filled with onions peppers and chorizo.The simple storefront with tables in the rear also sells empanadas of chicken meat or tuna.Pizza prices range from $7.90 to $11.80 for whole pies or $1 to $1.50 a slice. Empanadas are $1 and $1.10 each. Pizzeria Las Americas is open daily from 11:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; 718-478-5040. Adult Peanut ButterAdults - among them William F. Buckley Jr. Malcolm Forbes and Julia Child - are often caught with their fingers in the peanut butter jar. For such people the Peanut Advisory Board has published the ''Adults Only Peanut Butter Lovers Official Cooking Handbook.''The booklet has nine recipes for cookies and one for ice cream and can be obtained by sending a stamped self-addressed business-size envelope to Peanut Butter Cookies Peanut Advisory Board P.O. Box 7528 Tifton Ga. 31793.Here is the recipe for peanut butter shortbread to try while waiting for the booklet:Combine half a cup of softened unsalted butter half a cup of granulated sugar a quarter of a cup of creamy peanut butter and two cups of all-purpose flour in a bowl mixing the ingredients with your fingertips until they become crumbly like coarse meal. Press the mixture into an ungreased eight- or nine-inch round cake pan and with a fork prick lines in the dough to mark wedges.Bake at 300 degrees about an hour until very lightly browned. Cut into wedges when still warm but allow to cool completely before removing from the pan. Once cool the wedges can be embellished by glazing the tops with a melted three-ounce bar of semisweet chocolate. Painless Caramel

 0,Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman said his client will enter a plea of not guilty to the new charges when he appears before a judge on July 9. “Mr. Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false and he expects to be fully vindicated” Mr. Brafman said in a statement. “Furthermore to charge Mr. Weinstein as a predator when the interactions were each consensual is simply not justified.”The new indictment puts increased pressure on Mr. Weinstein. The original indictment contained a top charge of first-degree rape which carries a penalty of between five and 25 years in prison. But Mr. Weinstein is now charged with committing first-degree sexual crimes against more than one person which is considered predatory sexual assault. If convicted on that charge he faces a minimum of 10 years in prison and could be sentenced to 25 years to life.The predatory sexual assault law was not passed until 2006 so it could not be applied to the 2004 encounter involving Ms. Evans. But the other two women mentioned in the new indictment have said they were assaulted in 2006 and 2013 providing prosecutors a basis to charge Mr. Weinstein as a “predator” law enforcement officials said.Prosecutors said they are still interviewing witnesses and potential victims and the indictment against Mr. Weinstein may be updated again with more charges.It remained unclear if the new charges stemmed from accusations already made public against Mr. Weinstein or concerned a woman who has yet to come forward on social media or in news reports.Two of the women who have publicly accused Mr. Weinstein of attacking them in Manhattan are Paz de la Huerta and Mimi Haleyi. Ms. de la Huerta an actress known for her work on “Boardwalk Empire” told Vanity Fair last fall that Mr. Weinstein raped her on two separate occasions in her SoHo apartment in 2010.Ms. Haleyi who formerly worked as a production assistant on a Weinstein Company television series told reporters at an October news conference that Mr. Weinstein had invited her to his SoHo apartment in 2006 for what she assumed was a professional meeting. She said she had said “No” several times in the previous weeks to his flirtatious advances making it clear she had no romantic interest in him.Once she was in his apartment however Ms. Haleyi said Mr. Weinstein backed her into a child’s bedroom held her down on a bed and “orally forced himself” on her. “I tried to get him off me and kept asking him to stop but it was impossible” she said at the news conference. “He was extremely persistent and overpowering.”

 9,The ''L'' word wasn't dirty in at least one place last night - the annual Liberal Party dinner.Governor Cuomo told up to 700 Democrats and Liberals that ''liberalism properly understood is not just consistent with the American idea; liberalism properly understood is the American idea.''The Governor was attending his first Liberal Party dinner in several years after a rapprochement with the party leadership. He made an unusually serious speech for such a noisy political dinner attacking ''the grubby campaign of slander that the Republicans have waged trying to fool the American people.'' He assailed the Republicans for ''cheap efforts to distort'' liberalism.With Republican distortions he said ''freedom means permissiveness liberty means license privacy is pornography progress becomes chaos government means intrusion and conciliation means weakness.'' 'Celebrating the Liberal Policies'The Governor echoed other speakers including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Arthur Schlesinger the historian and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan in ''celebrating the liberal policies that have made this country great'' in the words of Fran Reiter vice chairman of the Liberal Party.

 0,Members of Congress return this week newly educated about their constituents' growing doubts about the cost of the Iraq occupation the health of the economy and the homeland's preparedness for disaster whether by grid failure or terrorist plot. The troubling budget deficits so eagerly engineered by President Bush and his Republican majority have only worsened during the vacation. The G.O.P. leaders face a difficult agenda and there are already more signs of fresh procrastination than of resolve. A prime example is the leaders' unwillingness to break out the problem of the Northeast power grid's failure into an emergency measure free of the pork-laden energy bill.If Congress learned anything this summer it should be the need to become a driving force in demanding a far more candid and thoughtful Iraq reconstruction plan from the administration. The House was able to muster some independence when it came to demanding the import of lower-price prescription drugs and overruling parts of the Federal Communications Commission plan to allow big media companies to own more TV stations. We would like to see more of that kind of spirit but it seems more likely that the majority will continue to move in lock step as it did when members cruelly blocked working-poor families from the new Bush child-credit tax break other Americans enjoy. The president has so far failed to deliver on his vow to fight for the poor but the opportunity is at hand if he dare resist his House majority leader Tom DeLay.The upcoming election cycle is likely to make it even more difficult to achieve progress on critical issues like homeland security. Members of Congress should be judged not so much by their patriotic rhetoric as their unwillingness thus far to adequately finance security at the nation's highly vulnerable ports or to begin inspecting cargo shipments aboard passenger jets. The Coast Guard estimates that $1 billion is needed next year to begin securing the ports; Congress so far has gone no higher than $150 million. And as Washington prepares to remember Sept. 11 Congress should press beyond White House resistance for the fullest inquiry into the terrorist plot's causes and money trail.Given the amount of damage this Congress has done already we might be grateful if the fall brought nothing more than large-scale standoffs already being predicted as lawmakers regather. The sorry House bill to protect gun makers from lawsuits would best die in the Senate. And the welfare reform issue will be difficult to address amid the continuing binge of deficit spending.

 0,Mr. Moulton is in particularly bad shape: He has been in the race for more than two months but has not reached 1 percent in a single qualifying poll according to the Times analysis. Aside from Mr. Sestak who announced his campaign less than two weeks ago Mr. Moulton is the only candidate in the 24-person field with this dubious distinction.[Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren gained ground in a series of post-debate polls.]The 14 candidates who have locked in a spot on the July debate stage by qualifying through both donors and polling in alphabetical order are: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Ind.; the former housing secretary Julián Castro; Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Kamala Harris of California; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; the self-help author Marianne Williamson; and the former tech executive Andrew Yang.Who could get cut from the third debate?An even larger group of candidates is expected to be left off the stage for the third debate in September. The D.N.C. raised the qualification thresholds for it significantly.Candidates will need to have at least 130000 donors and earn 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls. And this time they will have to meet both standards to make the cut.We surveyed the campaigns last month and while most did not provide data on unique donors a few did. Based on that information and what has been publicly released by the campaigns we know that seven candidates have already met the donor requirement.[Which presidential candidates raised the most money this spring?]Five of those seven — Mr. Biden Mr. Buttigieg Ms. Harris Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren — have routinely eclipsed 2 percent support in the polls and will presumably meet the polling requirement with ease. They are all but certain to earn a spot on the stage in September. A sixth Mr. O’Rourke also has a track record of achieving 2 percent or higher in the polls but a pair of post-debate surveys this week had him at 1 percent.Mr. Yang’s campaign announced Monday that he had also exceeded 130000 donors making him the seventh candidate to do so. But Mr. Yang’s support in the polls has wobbled between 0 and 2 percent and it is not clear whether he will achieve 2 percent four times in a two-month window.

 0,PhotoTHURSDAY PUZZLE — Every now and then I have this anxiety dream where something truly bizarre happens to The New York Times crossword puzzle on its way from Will Shortz’s desk to the print paper or the Internet. A lot of tricky stuff has to happen to get your puzzles to you including getting them past the EMUs in one piece so it’s not that far-fetched to think that my brain might worry about what might happen if say parts of the clues suddenly disappeared.What’s that you say? The clues really have disappeared? Oh that. That’s what we call a design feature not a flaw. Today’s puzzle by Timothy Polin makes good use of the phrase INVISIBLE INK by giving us the first letter of the theme clues and leaving us to figure out how those letters relate to the answers.For example we have the letter K as the sole clue at 18 Across and the answer is ECCENTRICITY. What does the letter K have to do with ECCENTRICITY? Well if you have already solved the revealer at 67 Across you know that we’re dealing with INVISIBLE INK. That INK has disappeared from the clue which would be “Kink” if we weren’t in the middle of one of my anxiety dreams. Kink of course is a synonym for ECCENTRICITY. Similarly “Fink” is a synonym for STOOL PIGEON (53 Across). I got held up at the S at 12 Down because I couldn’t figure out how FOUNDER was a synonym for “Sink” and thought it was incorrect. I asked Mr. Polin about this and I’m told that FOUNDER is a nautical term that means to fill up with water and sink.So now that we all acknowledge that the clues aren’t really missing I can relax and tell you that the Clue(s) of the day for me were “Frank refusal?” for NEIN and “Tough pill to swallow” for LOZENGE.Let’s see what Mr. Polin has to say for himself:Constructor’s NotesInspiration sometimes finds you in the strangest places. The phrase INVISIBLE INK had been stuck in my head for a long time but I’d never been able to wrangle it into a good crossword theme. Last May I even submitted a Sunday-sized puzzle with a completely different theme based on the same phrase which was rejected mercifully for a number of good reasons. It wasn’t until coming back from dropping someone off at the airport early one morning this past January semi-delirious from lack of sleep that I had this sudden insight: Tim you moron. Make the INK invisible in the clues not in the grid. Duh. O.K. so I have a pretty simple word game. You can convert one of this puzzle’s six theme answers into an equally viable answer for the same clue by altering (no adding or subtracting) just one letter. Can you figure it out? I’ll post the answer on XWord Info. Good luck!So let that be a lesson to all you aspiring constructors out there: When in doubt swap the clues for the entries. You never know what might work.Mr. Polin and I both agreed that a good video for this post would be a certain scene from Monty Python’s “Life of Brian” that speaks of “derring-do.” Unfortunately that scene is not standards-friendly but you are more than welcome to look it up. It features Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate and Graham Chapman as his friend with the name that cannot be written here.Since we can’t post that bit of hilarity let’s go in the opposite direction and listen to the actor and director ANDRE Gregory tell Wallace Shawn about reality in the 1981 film “My Dinner With ANDRE.”Your thoughts?

 0,Marie Rose Dorismond took a 28-hour bus trip to New York City to attend the wake and funeral for Sean Bell the 23-year-old killed in a police shooting last weekend Sarah Kershaw reports tonight.Mrs. Dorismond’s only son Patrick was killed at 26 by New York police in 2000. She was here to make herself available to the Bell family people she had never met and she also rejoined what has become an anguished club of relatives torn apart by police killings.Inside the crowded church in Jamaica Queens Mrs. Dorismond was weeping in the second row of pews only a few feet from the open coffin when Amadou Diallo’s mother Kadiatou arrived. Mrs. Dorismond rushed to her friend the two hugged for several minutes and Mrs. Dorismond shouted: “Again? Again? Again?”The funeral drew hundreds of mourners and protesters.

They then participate in a fishbowl discussion about journalism codes of ethics and write response papers.Author(s):Michelle Sale The New York Times Learning NetworkYasmin Chin Eisenhauer The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Examine how the First Amendment applies to the media.2. Consider questions of journalism ethics after a magazine agreed to turn confidential sources over to a grand jury by reading and discussing the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison.”3. Read codes of ethics for various media organizations then participate in a fishbowl discussion on press rights and responsibilities.4. Write response papers about Time magazine’s decision to provide documents revealing confidential sources to a grand jury.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050701friday.html (one per student)-copies of journalist codes of ethics found online at //www.asne.org/ideas/codes/codes.htm-resources about journalism ethics and laws relating to journalism (civics and journalism textbooks encyclopedias computers with Internet access etc.)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “The First Amendment of the United States Constitution states that ‘Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.’ What does this mean? What is the significance of a free press in a democratic society?” After a few minutes allow students time to share their answers. As a class brainstorm a list of situations actions or events where freedom of the press may be attacked or restricted due to other compelling interests. (The annotated text of the First Amendment is available from the FindLaw Web site at //caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/.)Explain to students that they will now read an article about a current legal case in which two reporters one for Time magazine and the other for The New York Times are being legally compelled to turn over their notes regarding a confidential source. (Background information about the case involving Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller known as the Valerie Plame investigation can be found online at the Web site for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press at //www.rcfp.org/shields_and_subpoenas.html#plame.)2. As a class read and discuss the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050701friday.html) focusing on the following questions:a. What decision did Time magazine announce?b. Why is it big news for a media organization to reveal a confidential source? What legal consequences are the two reporters facing?c. Who is Norman Pearlstine and why did he decide to hand in the documents?d. According to the article why is the case significant?e. Why has the press “traditionally argued that it needs confidential sources”?f. What is the position of Time’s reporter Matthew Cooper about Mr. Pearlstine’s decision? What documents are being handed over to the special prosecutor?g. How might Mr. Pearlstine’s actions affect Mr. Cooper? How might it they affect the situation of Judith Miller the New York Times reporter?h. Who is Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and what is his position in the case?i. What was the 1978 incident involving The New York Times? What position did the newspaper and reporter Myron Farber take in that case?j. What does Zachary W. Carter mean by “civil disobedience”?k. According to Mr. Carter and James C. Goodale how are the risks taken by an individual reporter different from risks taken by a company?l. What are the key points in this case? Who are the other reporters involved?m. According to the article what events in addition to the Plame case have created challenges for the news media?3. Divide students into six groups. Provide each group with copies of codes of ethics from various media organizations such as the American Society of Newspaper Editors the National Press Photographers Association and the Radio-Television News Directors Association. Codes of ethics for these and other organizations can be found at //www.asne.org/ideas/codes/codes.htm. Explain that they will be briefly examining these codes of ethics to prepare for a fishbowl discussion on journalism ethics.After a few minutes ask students to share what elements stood out from these codes. Write key words and ideas on the board for reference.Then explain to the class that they will be participating in a “fishbowl” discussion on journalism ethics. First ask students to number off one to five and then keep a list on the board of all “1’s” “2’s” “3’s” “4’s” and “5’s.” Ask all “1’s” to sit facing one another in the middle of a circle created by the rest of the students. The students in the center are the only ones allowed to speak. If a student from the outer circle wants to add to the discussion he or she moves to the middle of the circle taps a participant to indicate that he or she should resume a place in the outer circle and takes that student’s place as the new person in the discussion. After discussing the first question switch the students in the center to all “2’s” and allow the same fishbowl procedure to occur. Be sure to switch topics enough times so that all students have the opportunity to be in the center of the discussion at least once.Questions to pose to students include:-What is the role of the media in a democratic society?-Jail is often viewed as a deterrent of crimes or a corrective measure to prevent repeated crimes. Is jail an appropriate punishment for a journalist who refuses to reveal sources? Why or why not?-What are the dangers of limiting the freedoms journalists are entitled to when gathering information?-Do individual reporters and media companies have similar or different responsibilities to readers? To the law? To company shareholders? To the ethics of their profession?-Which is more important the public’s right to know or the judicial system’s need for information? Why?4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually students write reaction papers responding to the following task copied into a handout for easier student access: “Read the following statements taken from the article read during class. Write a 1-2 page paper responding to one or more of the following quotations. In addition to commenting on this opinion provide your own feelings about Time magazine’s decision to provide documents revealing confidential sources to a grand jury. Do you agree with this decision? Why or why not? Based on your reading and discussion in class how might this decision affect the actions of journalists and media organizations in the short term and in the future? How might it affect you as a news consumer?”QUOTATIONS-Norman Pearlstine editor in chief of Time Inc.: “‘I found myself really coming to the conclusion’ he said ‘that once the Supreme Court has spoken in a case involving national security and a grand jury we are not above the law and we have to behave the way ordinary citizens do.'”-Arthur Sulzberger Jr. publisher of The New York Times: “‘We are deeply disappointed by Time Inc.’s decision to deliver the subpoenaed records’ he said. ‘We faced similar pressures in 1978 when both our reporter Myron Farber and The Times Company were held in contempt of court for refusing to provide the names of confidential sources. Mr. Farber served 40 days in jail and we were forced to pay significant fines.'”-Zachary W. Carter a former United States attorney in Brooklyn: “‘I don’t believe that a company has the right to put the assets of it shareholders at risk in an act of civil disobedience’ he said. ‘On the other hand the reporters are only faced with the consequences to them personally. They have the absolute right to put their liberty and fortunes at risk.'”-James C. Goodale a former general counsel of The Times Company and an authority on legal protections for reporters: “‘A public company must protect its assets even if that means going into contempt’ he said. ‘It has an obligation under the First Amendment to protect those assets and it’s in the interest of shareholders to protect those assets.'”Students may share their response papers in a future class.Further Questions for Discussion:-Why might a reporter use an anonymous source?-What other professions have ethical codes?-How is an ethical code different from judicial laws?-What characterizes fair and honest reporting?-In the case of anonymous sources is a journalist or media organization that refuses to reveal sources acting “above the law”?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on completion of initial journal responses participation in class and group discussions thoughtful participation in fishbowl discussion and well-explained response papers.Vocabulary:confidential disclosure covert gravest subpoena precedent scrutiny credibility bias testify substantial counsel contempt of court incarceration curare acquitted relinquished obligations divvied civil disobedience consequences liberty fortunes beneficial institutional assets fate syndicated operative payback nepotistic boondoggle presumably scandals chillingExtension Activities:1. Research and write a briefing paper outlining the Watergate scandal and the role journalism ethics played in the reporting about it. What stance did Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward take regarding their sources? What stance did their editor Ben Bradlee and their employer The Washington Post take? How did the Supreme Court respond?2. Write a reaction paper examining why journalists unlike other professionals require a code of ethics that allows for the use of anonymous sources. Is there any other industry or field that legally uses anonymous sources?3. Create a pamphlet explaining how to begin a career in journalism. What type of schooling or training is necessary? Where can a person gain experience? What options are there within the field of journalism? Who are some famous journalists in each field? Why are they notable?4. Read “Red Light Green Light: A Plea for Balance in Media Ethics” by Roy Peter Clark (//www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=82553&sid=32) paying close attention to his “Red Light” and “Green Light” ethics lists. Write a position paper either supporting or opposing Mr. Clark’s opinion about how current affairs have impacted journalism ethics. Besides agreeing or disagreeing discuss the dangers of limiting (or not limiting) the media and work tactics of journalists.5. The Supreme Court case Branzburg v. Hayes (1972) examines whether news reporters being required to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries constitutes an abridgement of the freedoms of speech and press as guaranteed by the First Amendment.6. Conduct a debate on whether or not it is the responsibility of a news organization to protect its reporters in situations such as the one involving Mr. Cooper and Ms. Miller. Consider the stance of Time Inc. as well as The New York Times.Interdisciplinary Connections:Fine Arts – Create a poster illustrating the value of anonymous sources to American journalists.Global History-Research journalism ethics in various countries. Keep in mind that the type of government a nation has affects the way the media is run. Consider the media in non-democratic countries such as Cuba China Vietnam North Korea Iran the former Soviet Union etc. Prepare a chart illustrating the names of the countries types of government number of legal media outlets laws applicable to the media etc.-Prepare an oral presentation examining civil disobedience. What forms does it take? What famous acts of civil disobedience have occurred throughout world history? What impact did each event have?Teaching with The Times-Continue to read articles relating to the case against Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller. Clip headlines and key paragraphs and compile them into a news ethics journal. For each clipping write a brief summary of the article and you reaction to the events in this story.-Read and clip “The Ethicist” column by Randy Cohen in the Sunday New York Times Magazine for a month and respond to Mr. Cohen about one or more of his decisions.

 0,Models and other fashion insiders have been nursing miniature bottles of Champagne for years backstage at fashion shows and at chic parties and promotions. Cashing in on the cool appeal of casually sipping bubbly from a hand-held bottle companies like Moet & Chandon Veuve Clicquot and Pommery are marketing the minis or splits to the general public. Piper-Heidsieck has packaged its Baby Pipers (about a glass and a half) in eye-catching red bottles and distributes them to restaurants like Brasserie 8 1/2 and Flute ($15 a pop) which serve them right in the bottle like beer.Liquor stores carry the splits ($8 to $10) in party-ready packaging. York Wine & Spirits displays their Baby Pipers in boxes of 24. ''They're tiny sexy and luxurious and people have a sense of ownership when they hold them'' explained Herve Rousseau an owner of Flute who says the minis have been particularly popular with women since he began stocking them two weeks ago. ''They're like an accessory or toy.'' And since they have screw tops they won't explode all over an expensive silk blouse. JENNIFER TUNG

 0,As Greenland warms and its ice sheet melts sediment pours out along with the water. That might help meet a growing worldwide demand for sand.A few miles up the Sermilik Fjord in southwestern Greenland the water has abruptly turned milky a sign that it is loaded with suspended silt sand and other sediment.It is this material — carried here in a constant plume of meltwater from the Sermeq glacier at the head of the fjord — that Mette Bendixen a Danish scientist at the University of Colorado has come to see. As their research boat moves farther into the murky water she and several colleagues climb into a rubber dinghy to take samples.Mette Bendixen left David Blockley center and Mikkel Bojesen preparing to collect sediment samples.Dr. Bendixen a geomorphologist is here to investigate an idea one that she initially ran by colleagues to make sure it wasn’t crazy: Could this island population 57000 become a provider of sand to billions of people?Sand for eroded beaches potentially from the Rockaways to the Riviera. Sand to be used as bedding for pipes cables and other underground infrastructure. Mostly though sand for concrete to build the houses highways and harbors of a growing world.The world makes a lot of concrete more than 10 billion tons a year and is poised to make much more for a population that is forecast to grow by more than 25 percent by 2050. That makes sand which is about 40 percent of concrete by weight one of the most-used commodities in the world and one that is becoming harder to come by in some regions.But because of the erosive power of ice there is a lot of sand in Greenland. And with climate change accelerating the melting of Greenland’s mile-thick ice sheet — a recent study found that melting has increased sixfold since the 1980s — there is going to be a lot more.Sediment plumes are visible in the water below several of Greenland’s glaciers.“It’s not rocket science” Dr. Bendixen said. “One part of the world has something that other parts of the world are lacking.”Dr. Bendixen is planning a two-year study to answer basic questions about the idea including its feasibility and the environmental effects of extracting and exporting large amounts of the material. The government of Greenland a self-ruled territory of Denmark is studying it as well.It would be up to entrepreneurs possibly with assistance from the government to make the idea a reality. Given the potential cost of shipping sand around the world its feasibility would depend on the price of sand rising.Currently almost all sand is mined within 50 miles of where it is used said Jason C. Willett a minerals commodity specialist with the United States Geological Survey. “Once you move it any distance it then costs too much” he said.The idea also raises questions that go beyond science — about Greenland’s economic future about its potential independence from Denmark and even about the appropriateness of capitalizing on climate change.The need to diversify the economy is a big issue in Greenland where fishing accounts for about 90 percent of exports and Denmark provides nearly half of the government’s budget through a block grant. A large sand-exporting industry could help reduce this subsidy which would be critical to Greenland eventually becoming independent.“The diversification discussion is very important” said Birger Poppel a political science professor at the University of Greenland. “This could fit into that discussion.”Kuupik V. Kleist Greenland’s premier from 2009 to 2013 said that exploitation of mineral resources including sand were the obvious targets for greater economic growth.“But in order to replace half of the government budget you would need a lot of profit from any new activity which might arise” he said. “How many projects it takes and how big I’m not sure.”Over time Greenland’s ice sheet pulverizes the bedrock below. This silt sand and gravel forms deltas in the fjords.All told Greenland’s ice sheet delivers about 900 million tons of sediment to the waters surrounding the island each year or about 10 percent of all the sediment delivered to oceans worldwide. The glacier at Sermilik Fjord about 50 miles south of the capital Nuuk delivers about a quarter of Greenland’s total. That explains the vast delta of sand visible from the air as well as from a research boat as the tide begins to go out.The delta with muddy rivulets crisscrossing it stretches to the glacier more than five miles away.Dr. Bendixen has made some hypothetical calculations. If just 15 percent of the sediment pouring into this fjord every year could be extracted that amount of sand — 33 million tons — is twice the annual demand of San Diego County in California one of the most populous in the United States.GREENLAND Nuuk Sermilik Fjord LABRADOR SEA 20 MILES GREENLAND GREENLAND Nuuk Sermilik Fjord LABRADOR SEA GREENLAND 20 MILES GREENLAND Nuuk Sermilik Fjord LABRADOR SEA 20 MILES GREENLAND GREENLAND Nuuk Paamiut Sermilik Fjord LABRADOR SEA 20 MILES GREENLANDSermilik Fjord is only one of a number of places in Greenland with large amounts of sand. And the sand will keep coming as the world keeps warming and the ice sheet keeps melting. “It’s like a tap pouring not only water but sediment” she said.It was Dr. Bendixen’s work on the effects of climate change on Greenland that sparked the idea. She had come across a trove of aerial photos of the island taken by the American military during World War II. Comparing them with more recent satellite images it was obvious that deltas like the one in Sermilik Fjord were growing as the planet warmed and more meltwater came out of the ice sheet.Dr. Bendixen noted that Greenlanders’ contribution to global warming was very slight — their emissions are a tiny fraction of the global total. “They have a long list of negative consequences they have to deal with” she said including rising sea levels and thawing permafrost. “If one of the consequences is actually positive who are we to say that they cannot benefit from it?”Worldwide the demand for sand and gravel is relentless and increasing. Mining usually from open pits or by dredging is unregulated in many areas and often illegal. In India for example sand “mafias” have developed with gangs stealing sand from a river bend or a beach overnight.A United Nations report this year noted that extraction of sand around the world is exceeding the rates by which it is replenished. Sand removal along rivers and coastal regions often leads to greater erosion and harm to ecosystems the report said.In addition to better regulations the report called for reducing the demand for sand and gravel through improved designs that cut the amount of concrete in buildings and infrastructure. (Lighter designs would also help address a climate change problem: Manufacturing of cement the reactive ingredient in concrete is responsible for about 5 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide.)Concerns about the supply of sand seem far off in Nuuk population 17500 where it’s possible to walk from one end of the city to another in less than an hour and where the Greenland government works out of an office building above a shopping mall.Greenland’s capital Nuuk needs sand for its own plans to expand.But even Nuuk has its sights on expansion. There are plans to build thousands of homes and apartments to accommodate a population that is forecast to reach 30000 by 2030. More immediately work crews will soon begin lengthening the airport’s sole runway to handle jets which would help Greenland’s nascent tourism industry.Nicolai Mogensen who runs Nuuk’s only concrete plant is ready. This year he stockpiled extra sand anticipating the start of the runway project. He currently has about 15000 cubic yards a small gray mountain next to the plant. It comes from a nearby fjord sucked from the bottom by a dredge.Nicolai Mogensen has stockpiled sand for the concrete plant he runs in Nuuk.Mr. Mogensen who has run concrete plants in Norway Poland Germany and Denmark said he thought Dr. Bendixen’s idea was a good one. “All these countries are running out of sand” he said.Mike Hoegh who owns a marine salvage business extracts sand for use in Nuuk and other communities along the coast with his 150-foot dredging ship the Masik Sioraq. On a recent afternoon the ship was in a small fjord less than an hour’s sail from the capital.A 60-foot pipe is lowered to the seabed. Water and sand are sucked up and into the ship’s hold. The water is eventually displaced leaving 450 cubic yards of sand.What Dr. Bendixen and others envision would be on a much larger scale extracting sand from fjords like Sermilik and loading large bulk carriers for shipment elsewhere. Ports and loading facilities would have to be built.Dr. Bendixen said there could be environmental effects which she and her colleagues will investigate as part of their study. With all the meltwater and sediment entering it Sermilik Fjord’s ecosystem has always been disturbed she said. “But we’d need to assess the impacts in the vicinity of Sermilik that a dredging industry would cause.”Kaare Winther Hansen the World Wildlife Fund’s representative in Greenland said the fjords themselves were not that environmentally sensitive. “To my knowledge the biggest impact would be the shipping and a risk of accidents with those ships.”Dredging sand from one of Greenland’s fjords.For his dredging business Mr. Hoegh chooses areas where he knows the sand is good and there is little of the silt that was prevalent in the middle of the Sermilik Fjord. Nature tends to self-sort sediment: As a stream of meltwater enters the fjord and slows down the largest and heaviest material — gravel — drops out first followed by sand and finally silt. So one of the challenges of making large-scale sand extraction work would be to figure out a way to get to the sand and avoid the fine silt which would not be useful for concrete.On this their first foray in pursuit of sand samples to analyze Dr. Bendixen and her colleagues encountered some difficulties. Even after motoring the dinghy farther into the murky water all they were able to sample was silt.At one point Dr. Bendixen stepped out of the dinghy to tug it along. There was so much silt in the water she said it was like pulling the boat through paint. She hopes to use a helicopter for future fieldwork.Dr. Bendixen said the goal of her studies is to give Greenlanders a thorough analysis of the prospects for developing a sand industry. But that’s where her involvement would end.“It’s up to Greenland itself to figure out if this is something it wants to do.”

 9,Mr. Salinas will be sworn in at the Mexican Congress where in August and September enraged opposition legislators sought to prevent his certification as the country's President-elect. After nearly a month of heated debates and occasional fistfights however Mr. Salinas's victory in the July 6 balloting with a bare majority of 50.7 percent of the vote was made official.Opposition parties of the right and left continue to maintain that they were deprived of millions of votes and that Mr. Salinas is coming to office illegitimately. But negotiations aimed at preventing incidents during the inauguration ceremonies ended with both opposition blocs being permitted to state their positions before Mr. Salinas enters the legislative chamber.New doubts about Mr. Salinas's commitment to political change were raised this afternoon when Fernando Gutierrez Barrios Governor of the state of Veracruz was named Secretary of the Interior. That post whose responsibilities include supervision of the state police and security apparatus is the most politically influential and sensitive in the Cabinet. Mr. Gutierrez Barrios 61 headed the federal police in 1968 when army and security forces fired on student protestors here killing more than 250 people and he continues to be regarded as a hard-liner with no particular devotion to civil liberties. Minister Stays in CabinetIn a break with tradition Mr. Salinas retained Manuel Bartlett Diaz the current Interior Minister and his chief rival last year for the ruling party's presidential nomination in the Cabinet this time as Education Minister. Opposition leaders accused Mr. Bartlett of engineering the electoral fraud they say took place in July and the choice is likely to be as controversial as that of Mr. Guitierrez Barrios.As Foreign Minister Mr. Salinas chose Fernando Solana who is currently director of the Banco Nacional de Mexico and who has served previously as both Education and Commerce Ministers. Though the post of ambassador to Washington is not yet filled advisers to Mr. Salinas said the choice of Gustavo Petricioli the current Finance Minister was probable.

 9,Help Wanted: CriticWhen Pia Lindstrom first began working as a theater critic on television she was so worried that she wouldn't look as if she knew what she was talking about that she would eavesdrop on other theatergoers during intermission. "I used to go into the lobby lean over and listen" she said cackling.Eventually Ms. Lindstrom came to trust her instincts and became a graceful fixture on both WNBC-TV (Channel 4) and Broadway. But now after 23 years with the New York station she is leaving though she is not sure what's next. "I do think you have to pass the baton on to somebody else" she said.Will there be someone to grab it? The trend in television has been to downgrade theater coverage. Channels 2 4 5 7 9 and 11 once consistently broadcast reviews on opening night. At present only Channel 2 with Dennis Cunningham does. (Channels 5 7 and 9 have critics who review theater sporadically or on a freelance basis; 11 has no critic at all. New York City's cable Channel 1 also does reviews.) Terry Doll a spokeswoman for WNBC said "We will continue to have theater and movie reviews and the station is looking for someone to fill that role."Changes in coverage reflect changes in habits Ms. Lindstrom said: "Broadway theater is very much for tourists and people with $65. Our audience wants to take their kids to see 'Toy Story.' "

 9,The United States Steel Corporation said it had sold an 81 percent interest in its 64-story headquarters building here for $200 million and expects to sell the remaining interest by December. The purchaser was the California Public Employees Retirees System.David M. Roderick U.S. Steel's chairman said the building would remain the United States Steel Building and the company would continue to maintain its world headquarters here.The sale was seen as a move by the No.1 steelmaker to generate cash to pay for its $6.2 billion acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company. U.S. Steel had announced in July that it planned to raise $500 million to $750 million this year and a similar amount next year through the sale of assets.

 0,I walk around my house naked. My partner often does too. Not gratuitously just often. We don’t bother covering up when walking from bathroom to bedroom. We leave the door open when we get dressed. So far my 8- and 12-year-old sons remain unfazed. If I’m standing nude in the door of the bathroom telling my oldest to clean up the basement the only thing he finds audacious is the request.And both boys still wander around naked; they get hot they strip down. I don’t care about the visuals — naked television watching would be fine by me — but no bare bums on my couch. “Put on underpants” I say. And no nudity at the kitchen table. They may be arbitrary but those are the rules.For years I’ve known this had to change but thought there would be some obvious moment when we’d all know it was time to cover up — some sign from above or at the very least a demand from below. In particular I thought my oldest son as he approached his teens would be the one to draw the line.But nothing that clear has happened. Once he started shutting the door to the bathroom I thought I could take my cues from him — but he’s inconsistent. One day hearing something on the television while he was waiting for the bath he walked in hands covering his parts like a fig leaf unconcerned. Other days it’s “Mom do you mind? Give me some privacy!” while he’s changing his shirt.I’ve tried asking but the topic of nudity is far more embarrassing to him than the nudity itself and I don’t want him to feel like it’s a big deal. I love that it’s not a big deal.I’m not sure where my own inclination to roam around the house naked came from. It’s not like I haven’t struggled all my adult life with my body image. But there’s something affirming about how much my children have always loved and needed my body from breast-feeding to shared baths. That ease with one another’s nudity is part of the depth of my connection to them — something closed doors don’t offer. I know it has to change but when? In my childhood home no private parts were actively on display so no moment ever came when they had to be hidden away.Since I can’t ask my son what “normal” should look like I asked my friends what was going on in their homes. If their teenagers are any indication this Garden of Eden approach is doomed. One friend’s 15-year-old son David outnumbered by his two mothers and younger sister was 7 or 8 when he started closing the door to the bedroom and bathroom. He’s still frustrated that the women in his house leave doors open and trot past his bedroom naked with no respect for his desire not to see them. It’s not like he’s ashamed he says he just wants some boundaries. “And anyway it’s not like Penelope Cruz is walking around naked in my house.”David’s mothers agree they should try harder but it requires effort and they forget.Another friend’s husband is simply defiant: he agreed to the request for no nudity at home but retains the family cottage on a secluded lake with a floating dock as the last bastion against his two teenagers and their battle for familial modesty. The kids still come running to their mom with complaints: “Dad’s on the floating dock naked again. Do something.”Kids exhibit a range of responses to nudity from shame to awkwardness to disgust to letting it all hang out to flaunting it to you can look at me but I’m not interested in seeing you. What’s clear from everyone I talked to is that children set the household nudity agenda and it starts early.As soon as my toddler was old enough to climb into my bed I started wearing pajamas to sleep. As my kids got older they were louder and clearer about their preferences deciding when to display it or shut it away marking their boundaries and independence by withdrawing nudity completely then reintroducing it then withdrawing it again. The idea of no longer being intimately familiar with my children’s bodies makes me sad and yet I have no intention of walking the halls of my house with two full-grown naked men.We’re not ashamed of our bodies and we’re doing our best to ensure our kids feel good about theirs. We’ve defied the prudish version of modesty that makes nudity gross or necessary to hide. I don’t want to bother with a robe to get from the bathroom to the closet. I like that the kids will brush their teeth while I’m in the shower. But our bodies are ours to control. When my children are ready to cover up I’ll respect that. When they ask me to do it too I’ll dress accordingly.It’s all as it should be but I’m allowed to mourn the loss a little now and a little in advance. Maybe I should let them watch TV naked on the couch.

 0,CHICAGO – When Dewayne Wise leaped into history on July 23 with a spectacular catch to save Mark Buehrle’s perfect game he did it in front of a mural of Billy Pierce the former White Sox left-hander.When I interviewed Wise for this feature story I mentioned that Pierce once had a perfect game broken up with two out in the ninth inning. Wise was floored.“Really?” he cried. “You serious? Two outs in the ninth? Wow.”Pierce’s oddity in fact is more unusual than a perfect game. It was one of only nine occasions that a pitcher has lost a perfecto with two out in the ninth. The last you’ll remember was the Yankees’ Mike Mussina in 2001. There have been 18 perfect games.Buehrle needed Wise to make one of the greatest catches ever — given the degree of difficulty and the circumstances — to secure his gem. I asked Wise 31 for his favorite defense plays of all-time besides his own and he named three.First was Ken Griffey Jr.’s running airborne catch at the wall in Seattle in 1995 when Griffey broke his wrist robbing Kevin Bass of extra bases. He also mentioned a two-handed over-the-shoulder catch by Andruw Jones that I couldn’t precisely place.“And I like that Ozzie Smith play at shortstop bare-hand where it hits the rock or whatever” Wise said referring to an extraordinary grab from Smith’s 10th game in the majors on April 20 1978. “That was unbelievable to me to be able to lay out the ball takes a funny hop and you’re able to stick your hand up and catch it? That takes a lot of talent man.”It is Griffey who was Wise’s idol as a boy in South Carolina. He wore his hat backward because Griffey did and was thrilled to be his teammate late last season in Chicago and before that in Cincinnati. One spring training Wise said Griffey invited him to dinner on his yacht.“I’d just sit back and watch everything he does and say ‘God this is the guy I grew up idolizing and now I’m sitting beside him playing with him’ ” Wise said. “Man it’s unbelievable.”Now Wise has his own version of the unbelievable a play for the ages. And the mural of Pierce now has two words stenciled above it: THE CATCH.

 9,Right after hearing on Wednesday morning that a ferry had gone down en route from Tallinn Estonia to Stockholm Majlis Alm rushed down to the senior citizen's center here fearing the worst.Mrs. Alm a town council member who had previously run programs for elderly residents knew that a group of local retirees were on a ferry trip to Tallinn. When it became clear that it was their vessel that had capsized and sunk she summoned up the will to look at the list of their names. Six of the first eight names she saw were friends. Of the 56 people on the list -- all still missing and presumed dead -- she knew 20 well."I was reading the list and just crying" she said. "It was hard to be of much help to others."In a country that has been knocked off its bearings by the loss of the ferry Estonia and more than 800 of its passengers most of them Swedes no town has taken a harder blow than Norrkoping a placid port city of 120000 people 100 miles south of Stockholm.The 56 travelers from Norrkoping including 14 married couples were nearly all grandmothers and grandfathers longtime residents with relatives and friends all over town. Bengt Malmstrom was known to all as the former chairman of the local health authority. Arne Engberg had long organized a popular bicycle race.

 9,To the Editor:Kenneth W. Starr's choices in granting immunity reveal his true aim: to embarrass the President (front page July 29).Monica S. Lewinsky has been granted immunity from prosecution for a possible charge of lying under oath in order to trap the President on just such a charge. I can't see the logic in granting immunity to one person in order to prosecute another for the same crime. However if Mr. Starr's motives are not to see that justice is done but rather to skewer President Clinton then the logic is clear.ROBERT RESNIKOFFCroton-on-Hudson N.Y. July 30 1998

 0,California and New York and other big boys can move up their 2008 presidential primaries to influence the nominating contest all they want but tiny New Hampshire still has political muscle to spare.This afternoon Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama fell in line with several rivals for the Democratic nomination and agreed to participate in New Hampshire’s first Democratic presidential debate on June 3 sponsored by WMUR-TV the Union Leader and CNN.The Clinton and Obama campaigns had been ambivalent about participating in the New Hampshire debate: Inundated with dozens of requests for debates around the country the two camps had each preferred to stick to just six debates that are being sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee.Both campaigns indicated today that they still plan to participate in those six D.N.C. debates and are simply adding the New Hampshire forum to the list because well it’s New Hampshire long home to the first-in-the-nation primary that has proved a springboard for candidate after candidate (including Bill “Comeback Kid” Clinton).“The WMUR/Union Leader debate is an important part of the New Hampshire Primary tradition and Senator Clinton is excited to participate” said Clinton spokesperson Mo Elleithee in a statement. “She looks forward to this opportunity to continue her conversation with Granite Staters and demonstrate why she is the candidate most ready to lead and deliver the change we need.“We look forward to participating in the DNC’s schedule of six sanctioned debates that begins in July” Mr. Elleithee added.The Clinton campaign emailed its statement to reporters around 1:30 p.m. and Mr. Obama’s statement went out about 30 minutes later.“We had hoped that the DNC and the debate’s sponsors would agree to make this debate one of the DNC’s six sanctioned debates” said Obama state director Matt Rodriguez. “However Senator Obama believes talking about how we can change our politics with the other candidates in the home of the nation’s first primary is an opportunity too important to miss.”
 0,That truism is reflected in the way the convention program is structured. Virtually all the major speeches this week from those of Laura Bush and Gen. Colin L. Powell tonight and continuing with Senator John McCain and Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday the vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney on Wednesday and Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday are to take place between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. That just happens to be the hour each night that one or more of the over-the-air networks will be covering the Philadelphia proceedings live.''Everything is geared for the 10 to 11 o'clock hour'' said Tom Hannon the political director of CNN. ''They're obsessed about getting their message across in the 10 to 11 hour and that is their driving concern. People say that the conventions are for cable but as far as the parties are concerned the conventions are for the most eyeballs they can get.''Tonight the Republicans got those eyeballs at least on ABC but not exactly the program they had concocted. Like clockwork the preseason football game -- begun an hour early to accommodate the convention coverage -- ended a few minutes before 10 p.m. paving the way for Peter Jennings to introduce several minutes of highlights before seguing about a third of the way into a speech by Laura Bush. CBS broke into its ''48 Hours'' program early with an update and returned at 10:30 to cover the final half-hour.Viewers of ABC got a taste of what cable and PBS broadcast all night: an unusual showcase for multiculturalism. It was certainly the ''different'' sort of Republican evening the planners promised: videos of Gospel choirs and vignettes of inner-city school students who were used at times to underline the Bush campaign's promises of a more inclusive kind of Republicanism and to reinvigorate education reform.Governor and Mrs. Bush -- the former appearing by satellite from a classroom in Westerville Ohio -- both spoke with backdrops consisting of children seated at desks. For Mrs. Bush's remarks ABC even spliced in footage from a graduation ceremony in Crawford Tex. that the Bushes had attended.

 0,Ahead of Warren E. Buffett‘s Q.&A. with shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual meeting in Omaha the biggest question on many people’s minds was: how does the billionaire investor feel about Goldman Sachs?After all Goldman has been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for Securities Fraud. And the Justice Department has begun a preliminary inquiry of its own. Since the S.E.C. filed suit against Goldman two weeks ago the firm has lost $21 billion in market value.But in an interview with Bloomberg Television Mr. Buffett — who has $5 billion invested in Goldman — said he backed the firm’s chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein “100 percent.”Here’s more from Bloomberg:“He’s done a great job running that firm” Buffett said today in Omaha Nebraska in a Bloomberg Television interview before the shareholders meeting for his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “He’s smart. He’s high grade.” Buffett became one of Goldman Sachs’s most visible advocates amid public outrage over the bank’s pay practices and conduct with customers. He backed Blankfein in January saying the bank’s leader since 2006 “has been the right man” for the job. Last month Goldman Sachs was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Blankfein 55 was pilloried in Congress on April 27. The SEC said Goldman Sachs misled clients on the sale of assets tied to home loans as the housing market started to falter. The bank which said the suit is unfounded must weigh the risks of a legal battle against the benefits of a more immediate resolution as politicians vilify the firm as a symbol of the Wall Street excess that led to the collapse of the residential real estate market. Buffett said he will discuss the trade at the center of the regulator’s suit later today at the meeting and “I will bet that of the 40000 people in there 39900 of them have a misconception.”Go to Article from Bloomberg News »

 9,The characters in Lanford Wilson's ''Mound Builders'' are on an archeological dig in Illinois unearthing an Indian burial ground. Audiences who visit the Circle Repertory Company's new and revised revival of Mr. Wilson's 1975 play had better plan on doing some hard digging themselves. There are some fragments of interest in ''The Mound Builders'' but they are buried beneath mounds if not mountains of talk.Indeed this discursive drama may well separate its author's true fans from the dilettantes. First seen well after ''Lemon Sky'' (1970) and just before ''Serenading Louie'' (1976) -the two superior Wilson plays that have been treated to recent revivals at the Second Stage - ''The Mound Builders'' is best approached as a partial Rosetta Stone to the Talley plays that Mr. Wilson began with ''5th of July'' in 1978. Some crucial concerns of those later works are here in embryonic form from the durability of family and civilization in a destructive modern world to the class conflict of post-World War II America. Future Wilson characters are also prefigured and so is a setting: The rustic rented house where the archeologists summer in Blue Shoals Ill. has the porch screen door and insistent cricket serenade of the Talley manse in Lebanon Mo. (The good designer I probably needn't tell you is once again John Lee Beatty.) But if the later plays realize Mr. Wilson's ambitions in poetic Chekhovian terms (''5th of July'') and Tennessee Williams-flecked lyricism (''Talley's Folly'') - or failing that Lillian Hellmanesque melodrama (''Talley and Son'' revived by the Circle Rep this fall) - ''The Mound Builders'' is nearly all philosophical speechifying and highfalutin metaphor. While the play's half-dozen characters ostensibly represent two marriages three families and several love triangles their sexual genealogical gynecological and psychiatric histories are dropped perfunctorily and unconvincingly into amorphous college-style bull sessions. Never explored as deeply as the archeological sites nearby Mr. Wilson's people are usually mouthpieces for authorial sermons or pawns in symbolic conflicts pitting the builders against the spoilers the haves against the have-nots the idealists against the cynics.To make matters even more lugubrious there are two simultaneous time frames lengthy lectures about Indian anthropology metaphysical digressions about both fire-alarm and Chinese boxes and a much-heralded Old Testament cataclysm in Act II. While some of Mr. Wilson's characteristic wisdom and humor can be found so can lines like ''I have a real terror of gathering moss'' ''I'm swamped with commiserations'' and ''I'm definitely sick of esthetics.'' The audience seems to nod in agreement when one character expresses ''an intense desire'' to flip to the end of a book to find out prematurely ''how it all turns out.''Even so the Circle Rep does deserve credit for excavating this problematic effort by its foremost playwright if only so that students of the Wilson oeuvre can see his recent plays from another perspective. The production also initiates the company's ambitious new repertory cycle. ''The Mound Builders'' will be joined tomorrow night by Albert Camus's ''Caligula'' and later on by Anne Chislett's ''Quiet in the Land.'' To accommodate a program of this scale the company has temporarily left Greenwich Village for larger quarters at the Triplex Theater in TriBeCa.
 0,Though most of the 46 agencies in the evaluation released yesterday operate group homes for adolescents their residences range in size from small city apartments for three or four teenagers to the 150-acre Westchester campus of Children's Village where the 462 residents include some as young as 5.The three city offices that were evaluated run 30 homes the smallest an apartment for three teenagers under employee supervision the largest three centers that temporarily house 24 teenagers with mental and emotional problems.Some comparisons within the rankings are instructive however. Good Shepherd Services the top-rated agency operates some of the same types of programs for the same kinds of difficult teenagers as the city office in last place.Sister Paulette LoMonaco who has directed Good Shepherd's program for two decades says that one key to its success is a much better staff-to-child ratio than the state requires or that city payments alone would cover. When the state cut foster care rates a few years ago she said she successfully sought grants from private foundations like the Robin Hood Foundation to supplement the city contract.Though state rules allow one staff member to supervise nine teenagers for example Good Shepherd's Barbara Blum home in Brooklyn a short-term diagnostic center for 12 teenage boys never has fewer than three counselors present at all times she said and all its social workers have master's degrees. Ratios are similar at its 34-bed transitional residence for teenage girls on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.At the same time most agencies run such a large and varied mix of residential programs that large differences in quality may be missed by just looking at the rankings. The last-ranked agency for example the city office for Queens and Manhattan runs 12 homes including a quiet brownstone on West 85th Street which is known as one of the best city-run group homes.''We should get a hundred'' protested a 19-year-old girl who was crocheting in the brownstone's cozy living room when a reporter stopped by unannounced this week. ''They talk to us they love us. In my other group home I could leave at 3 o'clock in the morning and they'd be just looking like 'whatever.' ''

 9,Roughly one-quarter of the legislators from New York City and other areas served by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were absent Tuesday when the State Legislature voted to approve a financing package to rebuild the mass-transit system.No one has suggested that the outcome would have been different if the missing legislators had been present. The plan passed by a large margin in both houses. But citizen groups and others were critical.''They figured the votes were there to pass what needed to be passed'' said Paul H. Elisha executive director of the New York State branch of Common Cause a citizen advocacy group. ''But at a time when there's a great deal of discussion about raises for legislators a full-time Legislature the whole manner in which this special session was handled shows a very cavalier attitude on the part of legislators to the needs of the constituents. One would hope that that's not a bellwether for the year to come.'' #30 Absentees Recorded Of the 40 state senators who represent the 12-county area served by the M.T.A. 11 were officially listed as absent or ''excused.'' And in the Assembly which has 94 members whose districts fall within the M.T.A. service area 19 members were similarly listed.The counties served by the M.T.A. include the five of New York City as well as Nassau Suffolk Westchester Rockland Orange Dutchess and Putnam.

 0,The TV trucks arrived at 5 a.m.I’m back at federal Bankruptcy Court in Lower Manhattan this time to cover the first day of General Motors‘ long-awaited first-day hearings. (You can also follow along on Twitter.) And to no one’s surprise I’m not the only one with that bright idea.When I first arrived a little after 11 it became readily apparent that the courthouse staff was well prepared for the blitz of observers who would arrive. The plaza in front of the Bankruptcy Court (in the same building as the National Museum of the American Indian) was neatly sectioned off by metal barriers cordoning off pits for the expected throngs of photographers and video camera crews.And a small cadre of police and security officers were on hand to enforce order though none seemed particularly tense.By 1 p.m. a half-dozen spectators had grabbed seats in Room 623. That actually isn’t the customary courtroom for Judge Robert E. Gerber who was assigned to handle the G.M. case but that of Chief Judge Burton Lifland. Judge Gerber happens to have the smallest courtroom of all the bankruptcy judges in Manhattan a chamber roughly half the size of Judge Lifland’s whose much more spacious courtroom holds just under 100 people.Within the hour however the benches in the room quickly accumulated occupants. Assorted items — file folders stamped with law firm names papers bearing the CNBC logo various coats and jackets — sat sentry for future occupants. So too did dozens of young adults too fresh-faced to be anything but seat-warmers of one kind or another.(For what it’s worth the overflow room where I’ve camped out during the Chrysler hearings is far from packed. About a dozen folks are gathered here pecking away at their laptops.)By 3:30 p.m. it was hard not to navigate through the hallways without running into clumps of dark-suited lawyers striding down the hallway toward Judge Lifland’s courtroom which had become standing room only. Younger associates were easy to spot: they were the ones wheeling along cartons of documents.The hearing on Monday promises to be rather mundane concerned with typical first-day motions like payments to critical vendors and other concerns needed to keep the lights at G.M. on. The action should heat up when more controversial motions like the proposed 363 sale get under way.— Michael J. de la MercedGo to Michael’s Live-Tweeting of the G.M. Hearings
 0,A federal appeals court has ruled that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority which operates the transit system in Boston violated the free speech rights of a group that advocates marijuana use by banning its advertisements four years ago. The court said the authority had engaged in "viewpoint discrimination" by rejecting three advertisements from the group Change the Climate as the agency did not have the right to reject advertisements because it disagreed with their content. The general manager of the authority Michael H. Mulhern said the agency did not allow the advertisements because it felt they were intended for children. Katie Zezima (NYT)

 0,Democrats may have a reputation for being the “mommy party” but according to a survey of restructuring professionals Senator John McCain is the presidential candidate most likely to create a nurturing environment for turning around distressed companies.That’s among the findings in a survey by AlixPartners a business advisory firm that does brisk business in restructuring. As part of the firm’s second annual AlixPartners Risk Factor Index the firm surveyed 44 bankruptcy lawyers bankers fund managers and others.According to the survey 78 percent of these individuals think Mr. McCain the all-but-certain Republican nominee for president would most aid the work of those in the restructuring industry. On this question the two candidates for the Democratic nomination Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama earned just 11 percent each.Mr. McCain has sometimes spoken candidly of the troubles facing parts of the American economy most notably the auto industry. In the days before Michigan’s Republican primary in January the senator from Arizona told audiences that many of the state’s auto-making jobs probably wouldn’t come back a sentiment that Mitt Romney his opponent at the time deemed “defeatist.”But no matter who is in office respondents appear to think the federal government will intervene in the financial markets. About 74 percent of those surveyed expressed that view citing the role taken by the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve in arranging Bear Stearns‘s sale to JPMorgan Chase.What’s not in dispute is that these individuals expect to be busy. About 98 percent of respondents said a “big spike” in restructuring incidents is looming and 65 percent said it would likely to come by this winter. (About 30 percent said it would arrive by this fall.)Go to AlixPartners Press Release via BusinessWire »

 9,Doug provided a serious 20-minute lecture on raft safety. He explained what to do if we were tossed into the rapids -- lean back keep your legs up let the water carry you forward never try to put your feet down to stand you might get caught under a rock and dragged under -- and how to escape if you fall in and get caught under the raft. The neophyte rafters glanced around nervously. Most of us were first-timers whose biggest worries had been falling out of the raft and where we'd go to the bathroom. But we donned our life jackets and scrambled onboard. Our fears lifted as the boats caught the current and the journey began.We were hardly around the first bend in the river when we spotted two moose drinking near the water's edge. The wildlife generally steers clear of the human traffic because of an annual fall hunting season in the region that leaves the wildlife wary year round. But during the week we spotted several eagles soaring far above our heads lots of bighorn sheep scrambling across sheer rock a black bear and a varied assortment of mink snakes ducks and marmosets.At our first campsite I noticed what I assumed were bobcat or mountain lion tracks right next to our portable toilet. Malcolm confirmed that bobcats were local residents.Nervous apprehension about the rapids gave way after the first few rides through serious white water. Those of us who braved the front of the raft got the wettest; those in the back got the more thrilling ride. While not for the faint of heart these rapids amount to a great roller-coaster. By the end of the trip the white knuckles gripping the safety ropes had loosened and everyone was hoping for at least one Class IV experience. The river eased us in giving us two days of increasingly thrilling rides that peaked on the third and fourth days with treacherous white water at Salmon Falls and Vinegar rapids both of which were close to Class IV experiences.At Salmon Falls Steve a real-estate manager for the University of California took a scary spill in his first ducky ride and slid like a child's toy through the white water safe but shaken. But the river with its swift currents and swirling eddies is hardly the whole experience. Each campsite provides its own wonders. At one Melanie an art teacher from Moscow Idaho and a lifelong outdoors enthusiast lead a few of us up the canyon where she found the skeletal remains of a young buck untouched after it had died the previous winter.At our last campsite a ragged bighorn sheep wandered into camp and started nibbling on sneakers and T-shirts left out to dry. The determined scavenger would not be chased away virtually demanding a handout for herself and an adorable lamb that followed her deftly down the rocks.Holiday for an additional $50 provides tents sleeping bags mats and rain gear. David my travel companion is a former Boy Scout but we still fumbled helplessly with our tent the first night. By the end of the week we were pros.
 0,The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil industry strengthening efforts to thwart Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.Lawmakers voted 421-6 in favor of the Iran Sanctions Accountability and Human Rights Act of 2012 a set of measures that lawmakers said would starve Iran of revenue from its energy production and shipping trade the country’s largest export sectors. The legislation would punish financial institutions insurance companies and shippers that help Tehran sell its oil closing loopholes that have allowed Iran to circumvent existing sanctions.Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen a Florida Republican who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is the legislation’s sponsor said the bill “blacklists virtually all of Iran’s energy financial and transportation sectors and cuts off companies that keep doing business with Iran from access to our markets in the United States.”The Senate is expected to pass the legislation this week before Congress leaves on a five-week recess.The rush to pass new sanctions came after Mitt Romney the presumptive Republican presidential nominee visited Israel over the weekend and pledged to support its decisions about confronting Iran.The White House and lawmakers have acknowledged that their pressure campaign has not deterred Iran and that multilateral negotiations over the country’s nuclear program have stalled. In Israel on Monday Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta urged the American ally to give diplomatic and economic sanctions more time to work before carrying out a military strike.In a joint statement with Mr. Panetta on Wednesday Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister acknowledged that existing sanctions had damaged Iran’s economy but said they had no impact on its nuclear program.“Right now the Iranian regime believes that the international community does not have the will to stop its nuclear program” he said. “This must change and it must change quickly because time to resolve this issue peacefully is running out.”Repeating assurances by the Obama administration Mr. Panetta said the United States would not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon “and we will exert all options in the effort to ensure that that does not happen.”The sanctions bill was endorsed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and J Street two powerful lobby groups based in Washington.Some lawmakers from both parties opposed the bill including Representative Dennis J. Kucinich Democrat of Ohio. In a floor speech before the vote Representative Ron Paul Republican of Texas said passage of the new sanctions would be “an act of war.”“We’re over there poking our nose and poking our nose in other people’s affairs just looking for the chance to start another war” he said. “First in Syria then Iran. We have too many wars. We need to stop the wars. We don’t have the money to fight these wars any longer.”Update:The Senate passed the bill on a voice vote sending the measure to President Obama.
 9,To the Editor:Carlyle C. Douglas deserves credit for bringing attention to the gravity of Bedford-Stuyvesant's lead-poisoning problem (''In Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant Glimmers of Resurgence Are Visible'' news story April 19). However the article implies the commonly held misconception that the main cause of New York City's childhood lead-poisoning cases is toddlers picking and eating lead-coated paint chips from tenement walls.Studies have shown that only about 20 percent of the city's cases are caused in this manner.A majority of the city's childhood lead-poisoning cases are related directly to the deteriorating internal conditions of the apartment houses the children inhabit. Lead dust particles from crumbling walls and ceilings fall to the floor where young children walk crawl and play. They then inadvertently ingest the particles from the air they breath or more commonly by placing fingers covered with lead-paint dust into their mouths.Thus it should not be implied that the lead-poisoning victim is in any way to blame for his or her disease (i.e. picking and eating lead paint chips). Instead we should all begin to take account of the environmental hazards that children living in neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant face during their everyday lives.ANDREW B. BORINSTEIN New York April 20 1985 The writer a former research assistant for the New York Health Department's lead-poisoning-control program is a doctoral candidate in sociology at Columbia University.

 9,''Who do you believe'' Groucho Marx once asked ''me or your own eyes?''When Walter F. Mondale quoted that line in his second debate with Ronald Reagan he went to the heart of the difference between his campaign and Mr. Reagan's. The President is counting on the conviction that people do believe their own eyes relying in large measure on carefully staged and persuasive pictures to tell his story. Mr. Mondale relies more on the strength of his words.And as they present their cases to the American public they are not merely arguing in two different ways. They are also offering different versions of reality: the United States as a country with serious problems that must be tended to or one that is essentially well off. ''It's either the Land of Oz'' said one analyst ''or Kansas.''Mr. Reagan has largely bypassed the big-city newspapers by making extensive use of hundreds of local newspapers and television stations. Small Controlled GesturesAnd in him the Republicans have a candidate who has mastered the small controlled gestures of television: the cock of the eyebrow the turn of the head the soft voice that arrests and hold the attention of the viewer and establishes a sense of intimacy.
 0,In 2008 the Justice Department blocked Yahoo from making a deal with Google to provide the search ads for Yahoo’s web search efforts.Now Yahoo and Google are exploring a new relationship in which Yahoo would use Google for some regular search results as well as search ads.Yahoo confirmed on Wednesday that it has begun testing the use of Google search ads for a small portion of its desktop and mobile web search results. “As we work to create the absolute best experiences for Yahoo users from time to time we run small tests with a variety of partners including search providers” the company said in a statement. “There is nothing further to share at this time.”Google also confirmed the arrangement.The tests were first uncovered by Aaron Wall founder of SEO Book a site that helps companies improve their rankings in web searches.Yahoo got the right to work with other search providers in April when it renegotiated its partnership with Microsoft whose Bing search service had been the exclusive provider of search results and ads to Yahoo under a 10-year partnership between the companies. Under the revised deal Yahoo can use its own search technology or that of other providers for up to 49 percent of its search results.Marissa Mayer Yahoo’s chief executive oversaw search products at Google earlier in her career. However until now she has signaled that she was focused on developing new search products at Yahoo rather than turning to her old employer for help. She has also been aggressive at getting Yahoo’s search engine bundled into third-party products like Mozilla’s Firefox web browser and Oracle’s Java software.Any broad search deal between Yahoo and Google is likely to come under antitrust scrutiny. Google already handles most web searches worldwide and the European Commission has a formal antitrust case pending against it alleging it has abused its dominant position.

 9,"We tried our best to dignify the sport of soccer" Portugal Coach Carlos Queiroz said. "Too bad the goals did not come. If the field was dry there would be less collisions and fewer lost passes." Preview of 1993 MatchThe match part of the round-robin United States Cup that also features the national teams of Ireland and the United States was far from meaningless. Portugal and Italy will face each other next February in a pivotal World Cup qualifying match. There was some significant sizing up being done today.Italy started a lineup that was nearly as famous as its blue jerseys. Forwards Roberto Baggio and Gianluca Vialli poached near Portugal's goal ineffectively while goaltender Walter Zenga killed time while facing only three shots."Goalkeeping is a strange position" Zenga said. "I do more than make saves. I collaborate with the defense."Italy controlled the match for most of the first half when it seemed as if the young fleet Portuguese were star-gazing or playing for some nonexistent tie breaker. In the second half after a slew of substitutions by both sides Portugal became somewhat more aggressive with its counterattacks.

 9,3. Remove cooled ham from water. Preheat oven to 900 degrees. Cut off all rind except for a small band over the shank that will serve as a handle for carving. Trim off all fat leaving only layer between a quarter- and a halfinch thick. If you like score fat in a diamond pattern and stud with cloves in the traditional way although this is not customary with a country ham.4. Mix brown sugar with cornmeal mustard and pepper and moisten with bourbon or whichever juice you prefer. Spread over ham and bake for 20 minutes or until topping becomes bubbly and deep golden brown.5. Watch ham carefully during glazbig. Add more glaze it necessary and a little water if sugar melts down and looks as though it will burn. Country ham is best served cold. It should be sliced very thinly with the grain.Note: The excellent country ham we tested came from Kentucky and was salt‐cured. Hams now available from this same source are about 8 months old though they can be 12 to 15 months old at other times. These hams show white mold specks within the meat when sliced considered desirable by aficionados. If you like ham salty do not soak it or do so for only 12 hours. For novices the 29‐hour soak is preferable. Even with soaking it will be salty. Sugarcured hams are also available from the same source. These are known as city hams opposed to country hams and have far less character. Sugar‐cured hams which are not salty are made with sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite. Salt‐cured hams contain neither. Country ham traditionalists use no glaze and Donald Penn who makes these hams likes to boil his in water with Coca‐Cola. These Government‐inspected hams can be ordered from Penn's Old Country ‘Hams Route 6 Campbellsville Ky. 42718; (502) 965‐5065. They cost $1.89 per pound and range from 10 to 16 pounds. There is an additional charge for post age and a $1 charge for boxing. Expect hams c.o.d. one week from the time your order is received.A first cousin to Louisiana gumbo this thick soup‐stew may be made with file powder although Mr. Patteson's was not.

I have met several older and younger inmates active in the horticultural program at the Graterford Pa. state prison who are fine people that I would be proud to have as friends and neighbors.While I personally think that lifers who have reformed their lives in prison should be eligible for commutation care must be taken that the high cost of caring for elderly inmates is not used as an excuse to send them out when they are vulnerable and needy.Today when it appears that fewer and fewer Americans consider it important to be their brother's keeper it could be argued that many aging lifers would be better off being kept in prison assuming humane conditions than released if release is into poverty with no job prospects. Being set free when frail and needy could ultimately be a punishment more cruel than life imprisonment.TIMOTHY C. AUREDEN President Prihort Inc. Rosemont Pa.
 9,To the Editor:Abolition of the National Labor Relations Board does not require repeal of all the substantive provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.Prof. William B. Gould 4th is surely correct in his judgment that workers and their unions would be worse off in a regime regulated only by the market and perhaps the criminal law .But all players including management stockholders and consumers may be better off if the regulatory system does not rely upon an ''independent'' administrative agency presumably ''expert'' in matters of labor-management relations.Like most administrative agencies the labor board's first loyalty is to the board. The agency seeks to maximize its influence (and its budget) by ever-increasing regulatory intervention. The result is a mass of detailed rules lacking overall coherence. Parties are induced to engage in endless litigation to ''distinguish'' their case from all others.

 0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students learn about the history of major American music genres. Then through mock radio shows students examine the distinguishing features of each genre and how each has changed throughout the years.Author(s):Rachel McClain The New York Times Learning NetworkJavaid Khan The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Identify different American music genres.2. Learn about the winners in this year’s Grammy Awards by reading and discussing the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys U2 and ‘O Brother’.”3. Research the history instruments key musicians composition and themese of different American music genres.4. “Produce” radio shows representing their genres.Resources / Materials:-recording of 20-30 second selections of six different songs representing the following American music styles: rhythm and blues jazz bluegrass rock hip-hop and country-tape recorder or CD player to play the recording-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys U2 and ‘O Brother'” (one per student)-resources with information about the history of different American music genres (encyclopedias library resources computers with Internet access)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class prepare a recording of 20-30 second selections of six different songs representing the following American music styles: rhythm and blues jazz bluegrass rock hip-hop and country. Write the names of these styles on the board. At the beginning of class have students number a sheet of paper one to six. Explain that you will be playing six short music selections for the class. As each selection plays students should write the style of music they think the selection represents. Play the recording twice so that students can confirm their answers. Then go over the answers as a class discussing the different elements of each of these different styles of music such as rhythms common instruments and melodies. Why are these genres considered to be American? Who are some current popular performers in each genre?2. As a class read and discuss the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys U2 and ‘O Brother'” focusing on the following questions:a. What CD won album of the year in this year’s Grammys?b. How does the author of the article describe the film “O Brother Where Art Thou?”c. Who won best country vocal collaboration?d. According to the article what was “one of the night’s most poignant moments”?e. What awards did Alicia Keys win?f. What awards did U2 win?g. How does Bono feel about the effect of September 11 on his music?h. What were some of the answers to the question about why bluegrass and roots music dominated the Grammys?i. What “message to the industry” came from the classical field?3. Explain to students that they will be working in groups to investigate different American music genres and then create mock radio shows representing their findings. Divide class into six groups and assign each one of the styles from the initial class activity. Using all available materials each group researches their assigned type of music to discover the answers to the following questions (written on the board for easier student access):–When and where did this style develop?–Who have been the major figures (songwriters performers bands etc.) in this style since its birth?–What instruments are associated with this style of music and what roles do they play?–What are the standard rhythms melodies chords and other musical features of this style?–What are some common topics or themes addressed in the lyrics that accompany this style of music?–How has this style of music evolved since its inception to today?Then each group begins planning a mock radio show exploring the history of their assigned style of music. Each group should include ten recordings from the earliest years of the music’s “recorded” existence through today. Over the course of the show music selections should be prefaced with spoken introductions addressing the information from the research questions and explaining how the key figures and standard musical features of the genre have changed over the years. Before the end of class groups should divide responsibilities for finding and bringing in the recordings.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups compile and “produce” their radio shows tape recording them to play in a later class classes as part of an “American Music Festival.”Further Questions for Discussion:–How would you define “American music”?–What is your favorite genre of music? Is there a genre you really dislike? Why?–What is “popular music”? What genres fit into this larger category?–What do you think the outcome of the Grammys says about people’s musical tastes?–Do you think that the Grammy Awards are a measure of talent popularity or both? Why?–Do you think that most artists consider a Grammy Award to be a sign that they have “made it”? Do you think there are artists who do not place importance on the Grammy Awards? What might be the reason for these different points of view?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in initial class activity and class discussion group research and accurate and thoughtful American music genre radio shows.Vocabulary:contention climax wreaked vengeance poignant elliptical fervent paeans predicament turmoil consolidation underdogsExtension Activities:1. Compose and perform your own song (music and lyrics) in one of the music styles explored in the class activity. Keep in mind the defining features of this style when creating your song.2. Create your own “After Mozart” recording (or live performance) modeled after Gidon Kremer and Kremerata Baltica’s album. Choose a classical music piece that lends itself to modern electronic “sound effects” and perform your rendition for the class.3. Create a “fun facts playbill” to accompany this year’s Grammy Awards. Include information on this year’s nominees and artists who performed in the show. Provide general information about the artists as well as little-known facts such as childhood nicknames pet peeves and favorite foods. (Browse Internet fan sites for this obscure information.)4. Film a rockumentary about a current musician who you think has contributed the most to American music. Combine real and “fake” (staged between you and a friend playing the role of this musician) interview footage that highlights this artist’s achievements. Also include performance footage and interviews with people in your community commenting on this musician’s contribution to American music.Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics- Research the controversy behind the unauthorized use of copyrighted music such as Vanilla Ice’s use of “Under Pressure” in “Ice Ice Baby” or Lauren Hill’s cover of “Killing Me Softly.” Find an instance where the case went to court review the judge’s decision and write your own decision about what you think should have been the outcome of this conflict.Economics- Learn about cases in which music groups (such as TLC) or artists (such as Elton John) with top-selling albums are forced to declare bankruptcy. Then write a “Financial Guide for New Recording Artists” that includes tips about how to enter into fair contracts manage their money and deal with financial hardship.Geography- Research “home-grown” music genres from around the world. Choose a music genre from another country to present to your class. Dress up in costumes that reflect the culture that the music you chose represents and bring in instruments unique to this genre. Perform excerpts from songs that exemplify the genre’s unique features.Mathematics- Poll students in your school to find out about their music listening and purchasing habits. Compile your results in an article for your school’s newspaper.Media Studies- Watch “O Brother Where Art Thou?” Review the soundtrack of the film in terms of the following questions: How does the soundtrack enhance the film? Does the music ever detract from the plot of the film? Does the film rely too heavily on the soundtrack too little or is there just the right balance?Other Information on the Web:The Grammy Awards site (//grammy.com/) offers information on the 44th Annual Grammy Awards the history of the award audio and video of performances and more.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Music Standard 7- Understands the relationship between music and history and culture.

 9,The shooting woke us up. A sow grizzly and her three large cubs had come into a camp and they were fighting over something in the yard cuffing each other into the sides of the cabins. During the rest of the night the guides did what they could to send them on their way but nothing worked. Only sunrise helped. The four seemed consumed by guilt from their all-night party. They slipped into the brush on the west side of the camp and moments later were racing over the round stones of the river bar on their way out of Dodge.It was exhilarating. They had been around before and on a previous year had even chewed up the proprietor's airplane. This year there were more than a few dining on spawned-out salmon. It was an easy life on the verge of winter; but grizzlies did not require ease. If necessary they would ascend the high exposed scree slopes and snatch a mountain goat who thought he could safely watch the passing seasons in the valley below. It was rare for them to come into camp and it certainly gave a new piquancy to late trips to the outhouse.But this was the British Columbia wilderness and anything that made its contrast stark to our everyday world like the grizzly bear the raven the wolf or the eagle was welcome. To the robust cubs backing around the cabins with garbage sacks and low growls I wished to say "Have at it."I was here to fish for steelhead on one of the great angling rivers of the world the Dean. It was my fourth trip and as always with anadromous fish that return to spawn the question was whether or not the fish were in.

 0,The small immaculately catered luncheon that drew President Clinton to a stately home here today was billed as a benefit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But the anticipated recipient of much of the more than $1 million raised was the candidate who may have the least need for donations and the president's fund-raising help: Jon S. Corzine.Mr. Corzine the Wall Street multimillionaire who broke all records in spending nearly $35 million on his primary race has been a boon to Democratic candidates across the country because he has made heavy contributors out of wealthy friends in New Jersey and New York who were previously uninvolved in politics. Many were here today.Senator Robert G. Torricelli the chairman of the fund-raising committee who has begun to take a more direct hand in guiding Mr. Corzine's campaign as well missed the event because of a vote in Washington on aid to Colombia.But more than 40 people did show up paying at least $20000 apiece in addition to about a dozen local politicians. Among those who dined on medallions of poached Maine lobster tail under a backyard tent were former executives at Goldman Sachs & Company where Mr. Corzine was co-chairman until he resigned last year and other investment firms.
 0,Thorncrown is tall and narrow built of glass wood and stone. Mr. Jones used a stabilizing device believed to be new at the time crossed-wood bracing near the ceiling running most of the length of the building. Each brace is two lengths of two-by-four lumber joined by hollow steel joints that produce "a diamond fretwork of light" that creates "the illusion of infinity" Mr. Ivy writes.One of Mr. Jones's most ambitious projects was not completed. Tom Monaghan the founder of Domino's Pizza commissioned a palatial house at Ann Arbor Mich. in 1988. Four years into the project with construction well under way and with $3 million to $4 million already spent by Mr. Jones's estimate Mr. Monaghan suddenly halted the project. He had just read C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" and was stricken by a chapter on greed. He shifted his attention to building a Roman Catholic college in Florida.Mr. Jones designed 135 houses and 15 chapels and churches in 20 states from California to Massachusetts and from Florida to Colorado. Most were in Arkansas. He designed an assortment of other structures including fountains gardens pavilions and commercial buildings. He once designed an auto repair shop but the brothers who owned the business quarreled before it was built.Besides Thorncrown his other well-known sacred structures include the Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel in Bella Vista Ark. and the Marty Leonard Chapel in Fort Worth.Mr. Jones had no interest in skyscrapers but he did drafting work on one the Price Tower in Bartlesville Okla. when he was apprenticed to Wright.Euine Fay Jones was born on Jan. 31 1921 at Pine Bluff Ark. to Euine Fay Jones and Candy Louise Alston Jones. He grew up in El Dorado Ark. where his parents moved to run a restaurant. As a boy he liked to draw and to build treehouses. One burned when a spark from its brick fireplace escaped. He became interested in architecture when he saw a movie short subject in 1938 on Wright's new Johnson's Wax headquarters in Racine Wis.He studied engineering for two and a half years at the University of Arkansas then earned a degree in its new architecture program in 1950. He received a master's degree in 1951 at Rice University in Houston. Two years earlier at an A.I.A. convention in Houston a chance encounter with Wright led to a lasting connection. His first Taliesin Fellowship was in 1953.

 9,Others are looking in the meantime for alternative means to brighten the picture. But except for one outstanding exception the plans seem to rest on gambles as chancy as the casino campaign.The exception is the restoration of the beaches.In the glory days of Miami Beach which dwindled and then ended abruptly owing to a combination of events topped by the energy crisis of 1973‐74 the men who operated the seaside resorts along Hotel Row on Collins Avenue ran their empires with a keen sense of service business and cirofitmaking.They blocked measures to restore the narrow sandy beach that was eroded by natural ocean currents and the intrusion of concrete bulkheads and canopied hotel cabanas because they did not want the public to share widened beach with guests who were paying up to $100 a day.Other Projects illusoryWith economic reversals however the way was opened for the Federal Government to pump money and sand into Miami Beach: a $60 million dredging operation to restore 10 miles of oceanfront.Other projects are more illusory than real at the moment. Local business leaders are seeking $100 million in loan guarantees from Federal agencies to refurbish the resort hotels. They contend that such an investment would benefit the entire area.However Paul Dempsey an official with the Economic Development Administration in Washington said in telephone interview that the Miami Beach proposal had significant “defects” and would require extensive rewriting before it could be given serious consideration..“Our talks at this moment are very preliminary and only exploratory” said Mt. Dempsey. “A lot of the problem is obvious: Some of the hotels have been skimming off profits and the deterioration has been allowed to happen.”

 0,PHILADELPHIA — Henry Blanco has caught Mike Pelfrey’s last five starts and the combination has mostly worked well but Manager Jerry Manuel said he would like to mix it up a little bit and have Rod Barajas catch Pelfrey soon. Manuel said this before Pelfrey gave up six runs in four innings so it had nothing to do with Pelfrey’s performance against the Phillies.Manuel said the change would have come Saturday if it had been a night game. But it was a day game following a night game that Barajas caught so Manuel wanted to give him a rest even though Barajas hit two home runs and a double and knocked in three runs Friday night.He also has six home runs in his last seven games at Citizens Bank Park since leaving the Phillies after the 2007 season.Blanco had one of the Mets’ three hits off Roy Halladay on Saturday a double in the third inning. He was sacrificed to third but was stranded there after Angel Pagan drilled a line drive up the middle that was caught by Chase Utley at second.Some other interesting tidbits that came out of Saturday’s game:¶Jason Bay singled in the second inning to extend his hitting streak to eight games.¶Roy Halladay has five complete games in his last eight starts dating to last season with the Blue Jays.¶With 45264 people in attendance Citizens Bank Park was sold out for its 50th consecutive regular-season game.
 0,To the Editor:The anecdote from "McNamara's Old Bronx" about the pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski dropping in impulsively on a Bronx piano teacher (after hearing a Chopin nocturne emitting from an open window) and giving the astonished woman an impromptu free lesson (F.Y.I. April 24) reminds me of a similar event many years ago:Mischa Elman the legendary violinist was notorious for visiting unannounced Manhattan stringed-instrument dealers and repair shops. One afternoon in Rembert Wurlitzer's 42nd Street store I was trying out a violin to borrow for an audition. No sooner had I begun the Glazounov concerto when Elman popped in.I froze but he gestured to keep playing. Suddenly he cried "No no" grabbed the fiddle from me and played the entire first movement.It was a somewhat one-sided lesson since I didn't get to play another note.But I could not resist telling my fellow Juilliard students that I had a lesson with Elman.Les Dreyer Upper West SideThe writer is a violinist in the Metropolitan Opera orchestra.

 0,National Review’s Ramesh Ponnuru says “earmark reform” won’t fix everything about Congress that conservatives don’t like and in some ways it “could even be harmful” to their goals. … Steve Clemons of the Washington Note argues that President Bush in an April 2004 speech implied “that constitutional law requires you — as President of the United States — to secure a court order before wiretapping.” . . . In the Boston Globe Harvard professor Edward L. Glaeser writes that “[W]e are in danger of doing a far worse job rebuilding New Orleans than rebuilding Baghdad.” … At the Huffington Post Congressional Quarterly’s Craig Crawford blogs about what he calls New Orleans’s “six-sentence disaster” in the State of the Union address: “Can there be any more proof that the federal government is washing its hands of the worst natural disaster in U.S. history? Dozens and dozens of paragraphs on rebuilding other nations but barely a mention of New Orleans. … Maybe Louisiana should secede and turn over their oil to Islamic radicals — then the feds would invade and finally rebuild.”

 9,Yet most Argentine governments have been staunchly anti-Communist and have supported United States attempts to fight Communism in the Western Hemisphere. President Roberto Eduardo Viola has publicly supported American involvement in El Salvador and a senior army general suggested that Argentina should send troops though General Viola quickly disavowed that idea.Since a retired American general Vernon A. Walters visited this capital four months ago seeking support for the United States policy in El Salvador the Administration has been trying to improve relations with the key countries of South America particularly Argentina and Brazil. Sea Defense Is IssueMr. Buckley and others have said that Argentina and Brazil are necessary to defend the South Atlantic sea lanes. Tankers from the Persian Gulf area round Africa and move up the Atlantic narrows to Europe. But both Argentines and Europeans here note that several thousand miles separate the coasts of South America and Africa and that there is almost no international ocean traffic along the coast of Argentina and around the tip of South America.The South American route would become more important if the Panama Canal were closed but numerous strategic studies in the United States have observed that the most critical goods passing through the canal could be moved overland.Moreover it is noted here that even when relations between the United States and Argentina were at their worst during the Carter years Argentina was too anti-Communist to forge a military relationship with the Soviet Union. Out of economic necessity it has sold grain to the Soviet Union and it bought Soviet heavy water for its nuclear reactors last year. But there are no Soviet military advisers or equipment here and even Soviet cultural affairs officers must get special permission for their activities.Any lifting of the United States arms embargo is unlikely to result in a boon for the United States arms industry defense analysts here say. The Argentines are already locked into long-term contracts with West German and French suppliers for such items as surface ships and submarines. The country makes many of its other weapons such as tanks. Spare Parts Are NeededSome air force generals here have raised the possibility of a $3 billion order for jet fighters to replace some of the country's older A-4's and its assortment of French and Israeli planes. But Government officials say that any such order is highly speculative because the Government is trying to cut its budget.

 0,That was then and this is now. But now racing incredibly is getting a second chance. Now Fusaichi Pegasus has ended his four-month absence by winning the Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park last weekend with class and command and racing has rediscovered the thrill that comes with a great race horse. Or as it surmised last spring with two great race horses: Pegasus the 3-year-old winner of the Kentucky Derby and Lemon Drop Kid the 4-year-old winner of last year's Belmont Stakes and of this year's Brooklyn Suburban Whitney and Woodward.They have suddenly become rivals for Horse of the Year and they are facing two theatrical chances to settle the issue: the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park on Oct. 14 and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov. 4. What more could racing want?But this is where fact and fancy collide. Maybe it is too obvious two horses racing twice to see which one is truly the Horse of the Year. Maybe it lacks the complicated charm (and controversy) fanned by business ''solutions'' to the identity crisis threatening the sport. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association proposes to streamline its operations with a sophisticated technology network that might cost somebody between $100 million and $200 million. Frank Stronach's Magna Entertainment is looking into the idea of creating a national thoroughbred league with three or four franchises of 30 horses and ''teams'' of five horses.Suppose they had banked on Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet for such a league this summer but then found both stars injured? If Mark McGwire gets hurt the St. Louis Cardinals still report for the playoffs. But if Fusaichi Pegasus gets hurt does Neil Drysdale send in a pinch-runner? In racing you can't write the perfect script. Horses are individuals owned and trained by individuals with differing goals and motives.Stronach who owns various racetracks probably said it best when searching for reasons Fusaichi Pegasus had lost the Preakness to his Red Bullet: ''Horses aren't machines.'' Call it the X factor. It's what makes racing dramatic. Maddening true but utterly dramatic because it follows no script. The enticing part is voiced by John Terranova the trainer of Gander who was third in the Woodward: ''Fusaichi Pegasus is in a different universe as far as horses go.''

 9,The suffering of the Iraqi people cries out for compassion. Shortages of food medicine clean water and electricity now threaten to cause more death and disease than the Persian Gulf war. Indeed the worsening plight of Iraq's vulnerable children and powerless adults virtually demands some easing of the economic sanctions. Why make the Iraqi people suffer for the crimes of Saddam Hussein?But the sanctions remain one of the few levers by which the allied coalition hopes to disarm Iraq's nuclear chemical and biological capabilities. As Iraq disdainfully evades international inspectors the allies know they need every bit of pressure they can muster.There may be a way out of this dilemma: Permit Iraq to resume oil exports but impound the earnings and apply some of them to humanitarian assistance.Satellite photos and defectors' reports make clear that Iraq continues to violate the terms of the United Nations cease-fire. Iraq supplied misleading accounts of its nuclear arms program and still tries to conceal arms-making equipment and facilities from international inspectors. As if to underscore reports that Washington is weighing military options President Bush says "all means necessary" may be used to enforce the cease-fire resolution. But bombing during the war did not succeed in eliminating Saddam Hussein's nuclear capacity.

 0,The Bagger is so far back on the red-eye to Newark that he had to take a break on his way to the seat. It is more crowded than the People magazine party after the Screen Actors Guild awards and although the Bagger can’t see first class from here he’s pretty sure Philip Seymour Hoffman is not in the room. The Bagger is typing through turbulence over Kansas and trying to forget the trauma of watching “Flight 93” on the A&E channel. It didn’t scare him; it made him feel dirty for watching the whole thing. Now let’s roll:Call the Bagger a geek a newbie a rube without portfolio but he thoroughly enjoyed the Oscar announcements Tuesday morning. After several days of awards events where the signal-to-noise ratio was so high on the noise side it left much beyond the Bagger’s ken the nominations were a clarifying moment comparatively speaking. The event had it all: media throng glamour in the form of Mira Sorvino (sorry Sid) tension excitement and denouement. And it ended in providing a new data set that can be endlessly deconstructed. It was organized well – the Bagger was ushered into a clean well-lighted place with ample opportunities for hydration and engorgement the event went off almost on time and then the Bagger was thrown clear. And now that the nominations have been announced ending months of speculation the real speculation can begin. The almost five weeks of idle time means that much mischief will unfurl. So let’s do our part.Photo: Mira Sorvino poses after announcing the nominations for the 78th annual Academy awards in Beverly Hills. (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)

 9,Three Episcopal churches addressed themselves in different ways yesterday to the rising dissension in their denomination stemming largely from its willingness to ordain women. In West Palm Beach Fla. a congregation refused to bear Bishop James Duncan above beam it voted overwhelmingly to secede from the church. In Plainfield N.J. the priest of secessionist St. Stephen's Church forbidden in officiate by court order stood by the altar while another priest prayed that diocesan bishops might “come to their senses” about women's ordination. And in Manhattan the Church of the Ascension celebrated its 150th anniversary with a tacit affirmation that for the future as Donald R. Goodness the rector said “If the church is here it will be part of the Episcopal Church.” Articles on the three parishes appear on Page 61.

 9,''We're very glad to see George Washington in such good form'' said Mitsuko Suzuki of Japan who traveled to New York City with four members of her family for the festivities. Closing the CycleYesterday's ceremony capped a series of observances of the nation's founding that included the celebration of American independence in 1976 and the 1987 salute to the Constitution. And the inaugural re-enactment came after a weekend of festivities that brought a flotilla of tall ships into New York Harbor and sent fireworks flashing over lower Manhattan on Saturday. In the foggy night sky the fireworks had a washed-out look but the crowd oohed and aahed as rosettes bloomed above New York harbor and cannon-like booms echoed back and forth.After the first inauguration 200 years ago Dr. W. W. Buchanan a godson of Washington wrote that there was ''a police office and watch-house'' at Broad and Wall Streets and he watched the inauguration from there. That station house is long gone but the police were on hand yesterday. More than 4500 officers were stationed throughout lower Manhattan and most of the area was sealed off to private cars for most of the weekend.Yesterday's events began where Washington began his day 200 years ago at St. Paul's Chapel between Fulton and Vesey Streets. Two hundred years ago its steeple made it one of the tallest buildings in Manhattan; now it is dwarfed by the World Trade Center and almost everything else nearby. But inside the sanctuary with its clear glass windows and covered altar the pew that George Washington used on his inauguration day is still there.For yesterday's ''Service of Thanksgiving'' the church was filled with more than 300 dignitaries including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a Democrat of New York. He arrived as the deep ancient bells in the church tower tolled. A Hymn Is ReprisedMayor Edward I. Koch was already inside as were Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a fellow Democrat; Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato a New York Republican; Senator Frank Lautenberg a New Jersey Democrat and the actress Helen Hayes.Mr. Bush's heavily-guarded motorcade glided to a stop under a tent outside the chapel and the President and Mrs. Bush went inside where bright television lights and video cameras were nestled between the chapel's ornate white columns. There was no sermon only readings and prayers including one by the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr. the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Mr. Moore greeted the Bushes and noted that he had once worked on a ''civil rights program in Texas'' with them.
 0,PhotoHOUSTON – I remember being in a journalism class at Fresno State University in central California as everyone sat in silence stumped. The professor had asked us the simplest of questions.What’s the first thing you do after you get a story assignment?Students jumped in with answers. Pick up the phone. Run out to the story. Grab a notebook. Start writing. The professor a wiry fiery chain-smoking newsman straight from central casting named George Flynn dismissed all responses.No one guessed the correct answer – go to the morgue.The morgue is what newsrooms decades ago used to call the dusty collection of file cabinets where old stories are kept arranged by subject. How long had that bookstore that burned down in a fire this morning been open? Long before Google you went to the morgue to pull the file on the bookstore to find out and to turn up scraps of information and clues that would lead you closer to the heart of the story.I thought of the morgue and of Professor Flynn on Wednesday.I was intrigued by the practice of “rough rides” the brutal tradition of police misconduct in which handcuffed suspects in the back of police wagons are given a bumpy and wall-slamming ride. Other news outlets had done articles on the phenomenon in light of Freddie Gray the Baltimore man who prosecutors said Friday suffered a fatal spinal injury while being transported in a police van.What to do first?Go to the morgue. In today’s world that means essentially to go to Nexis.Nexis is the database that allows users to search millions of legal documents and newspaper stories for the most obscure and specific items. It’s the global morgue on your laptop. In a couple of hours on Wednesday I searched for rough-riding-related search terms and started reading. I looked for references to suspects who had accused the police of giving them a rough ride in dozens of newspapers around the country from the 1980s to the present. I was trying to find cases in other cities beyond those that other news media outlets had reported.The point of the morgue and of Nexis is not to use other newspapers’ material. The collection of old news stories you gather and read points you to the names of experts to lawsuits to cities. That retired Philadelphia police officer who was quoted in The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2001 saying rookies learn about rough-riding as part of their street training? With a little digging I tracked down his home phone number and left him a message.I read a reference in a news story to an old lawsuit in Chicago by the American Civil Liberties Union. I called the A.C.L.U. press office and the A.C.L.U. of Illinois started looking into it. They eventually sent me a link to download documents from the lawsuit filed in 1981 in federal court in Chicago. As I read these documents which described an alleged rough ride given to a handcuffed man named Freddie Franklin that caused him to bite off his lower lip the subject of rough rides turned from a half-baked idea into a full-fledged story.I had already been talking to several civil rights lawyers and police-procedures experts around the country in covering the recent fatal police shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston S.C. I called some of those same sources to ask if they had ever heard of rough-riding. How did I find and why would I trust those sources?I noticed that a few of the members of the task force that President Obama created to examine police practices in minority communities had served on Harvard University’s Executive Session on Policing and Public Safety. I got the membership list and started contacting former session participants.By Thursday morning I had pitched the story to my editors. Now I had a few more hours to do more digging before a version of the article would be posted on the home page on Thursday afternoon.Time is the enemy of the journalist. I remember reading the line in an old journalism textbook. And it’s true. You must get what you can when you can. The retired Philadelphia officer never called back. The A.C.L.U. had lost touch with Mr. Franklin who filed the federal suit in Chicago. I found a lawsuit filed against the City of Aurora Ill. in 1999 but the case was so old that no actual documents were available online in the federal court system database so I could use but limited detail from that case.In the end some of the best material in the article came from that original search of decades-old newspaper stories. In other words it came from the morgue.
 9,A Federal judge yesterday revoked the $1 million bail of Angelo Ruggiero asserting that Mr. Ruggiero ''might be a danger to society'' if he remained free while awaiting trial on heroin-trafficking charges. No date has been set for the trial.The ruling was made by Judge Mark A. Costantino in Federal District Court in Brooklyn in connection with the August 1983 arrest of Mr. Ruggiero whom authorities have identified as a high-ranking member of the Gambino organized-crime family.The bail revocation request was made by Federal prosecutors after the 46-year-old Mr. Ruggiero was permitted last week to remain free on bail after his recent arrest on Federal racketeering charges.During the earlier bail hearing on the racketeering charges a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent testified that Mr. Ruggiero and John Gotti had engineered the murders last Dec. 16 of Paul Castellano the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family and his top aide Thomas Bilotti. Authorities have said that subsequently Mr. Gotti had become the new head of the organization. Mr. Gotti is also being held without bail pending the outcome of his trial on Federal racketeering charges.

 0,Slide ShowIt is a $1 trillion game: Use It or Lose It.The private equity world is sitting on that 13-figure sum. It’s what the industry calls dry powder. If they don’t spend their cash pile snapping up acquisitions soon they may have to return it to their investors.Nearly $200 billion from funds raised in 2007 and 2008 alone needs to be spent in the next 12 months or it must be given back.DealBook Column View all posts Private equity executives after spending the last several years largely on the sidelines amid the economic uncertainty — often proclaiming “patience” as an explanation — have begun to be anxious that they may need to go on a shopping spree. At least two major private equity firms according to two executives involved in the discussions have held internal strategy sessions in recent weeks about how to approach the looming deadline.Some private equity firms have put the word out to Wall Street banks that they want to go “elephant hunting” — seeking big deals worth as much as $10 billion — and are willing to pay a special bounty for bringing them acquisition targets.At least one firm has gone so far as to begin contemplating asking its investors which include the nation’s largest pension funds to extend the deadline for the money to be spent in return for certain concessions on fees. (Of course they don’t return the fees that have been collected thus far).“The clock is ticking loudly for these funds” Hugh MacArthur the head of Bain & Company’s private equity practice wrote as the lead author of a report on the state of the industry.So the race is on.But of course there is a problem: “Burning off the aging dry powder will likely result in too much capital chasing too few deals throughout 2012” according to Mr. MacArthur.That means it is possible we could see a series of bad deals with even worse returns.Already private equity firms have been quietly spending lots of cash. In the third quarter alone private equity firms in the United States burned through $45 billion up from $17.1 billion in the previous quarter according to Capital IQ which tracks deals data. Carlyle Group which had its initial public offering in May has been the busiest firm this year: it has done 11 deals worth almost $12 billion.Acquisition prices are also likely to balloon because of “lots of firms bidding for the same obvious deals” Alastair Gibbons a senior partner at Bridgepoint Capital told Triago a fund-raising services firm that publishes a widely read quarterly newsletter. “Since there is near record dry powder globally it’s entirely plausible that we’ll see increasingly overcrowded bidding processes.”Richard Peterson an analyst for S&P Capital IQ’s Global Markets Intelligence group said that private equity firms are already paying multiples of Ebitda — earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization — of 10.6 this year up from 10.3 last year. It’s worth remembering that many of the most successful deals in the private equity industry were bought for six to eight times Ebitda he said.He noted however that since firms were able to borrow at unheard-of low rates today “it may give them more confidence to pay a little bit more.”Perhaps in a sign of desperation many private equity firms have been increasingly engaged in a game of “hot potato” with one firm selling a business to another — known as a secondary deal. Mr. Peterson said that at the current pace the industry was expected to spend a record-breaking $22.3 billion this year simply buying companies from each other rather than buying businesses from the public markets or from private owners outside the private equity industry.Mr. Peterson also raised a question that is often being whispered about but rarely said aloud: “A lot of these firms are publicly traded now. So to what degree are the transactions being driven by earnings objectives?”Many of the big private equity firms — Apollo Group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group among them — are public. And for the first time it is possible that the interests of the public shareholders could diverge from the interests of the investors in the buyout funds at least in the short term.If the private equity firms don’t spend the money that they have already raised it is unlikely they will be able to raise even more in coming years. And increasingly the private equity firms have become dependent on the management fees not just to keep the lights on but to expand their businesses into other areas in part to diversify which has been part of the pitch to public investors. The biggest firms have become asset gatherers.“In a nutshell 95 percent of funds would be affected and see a big drop in fee income based on not investing all of the committed capital” according to Tim Friedman director of North America for Preqin which tracks private equity fund-raising and deals. He said that he did not expect firms to do deals simply “for the sake of it” but he also cautioned that the firms were “under a lot of pressure.”So keep an eye out for megadeal headlines — and whether they command the same prices when the companies are sold.

 0,Kenneth C. Griffin founder of the Citadel Investment Group came about as close as legally possible Tuesday to advertise that his highflying $20 billion hedge fund is on the edge of going public Dow Jones reported.“The asset management businesses really have been the shining stars of the last 12 months” he said Tuesday as part of a Milken Institute panel titled “State of the State of Wall Street: Creating Opportunity Out of Chaos.”While he lambasted Bear Stearns UBS and other investment and commercial banks for risk-management gaffes that have led to near- catastrophic losses he cheerily said the climate for asset managers such as Citadel and fixed-income specialist Pimco “looks pretty good over the next six to 12 months.” He added that investors appreciate the strong returns amid the gloomy environment for financial services firms.Mr. Griffin has sparked I.P.O. chatter with several Wall Street hires including the news last fall that the firm had brought in John Andrews Goldman Sach‘s head of investor relations as a managing director. The speculation that Citadel may go public resurfaced in February when the firm announced that it had split its hedge-fund business from an options market-making unit.However Mr. Griffin told Dow Jones following his speech at the Milken Institute that he doesn’t expect to go public any time soon.Go to Article from Dow Jones via CNN Money »

 0,Though Mr. Trump’s campaign announced a new Asian Pacific American Advisory Committee last week a Republican National Committee spokesman Ninio Fetalvo said Mr. Trump’s outreach to Asian-American voters had been coordinated until now mainly through two staff members at the party’s Washington headquarters. The party he added has also printed materials in a variety of Asian languages in cities like Las Vegas.Republicans’ difficulties with Asian-Americans are similar to those the party has faced with most minority groups. A sense that the party is hostile to immigrants and minorities has driven more Asian-American voters into the Democratic Party lately political scientists and community leaders said. And if Republicans do not make more of an effort those voting shifts could harden just as Hispanics’ voting patterns have.“What we see now are some early indications that people who either leaned toward the Democratic Party or did not identify with either party are now starting to identify as Democrats” said Karthick Ramakrishnan a professor of political science at the University of California Riverside. “This is still a group that is making up its mind” he added “but it should be concerning to the Republican Party that you’re starting to see this crystallization.”A national survey in the spring by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote a nonpartisan research group showed “a significant leftward shift” since 2012 among Asian-American registered voters with 47 percent now identifying with the Democratic Party compared with 35 percent in 2012. Fifteen percent identified as Republican.In 1992 the year national exit polls started reporting Asian-American sentiment the group leaned Republican supporting George Bush over Bill Clinton 55 percent to 31 percent. But by 2012 that had reversed. Asian-Americans overwhelmingly supported President Obama over Mitt Romney — 73 percent to 26 percent almost the same margin by which Hispanics favored Mr. Obama.A Pew Research Center report released last month showed that Asian-Americans have since 2008 embraced the Democratic Party at a faster rate than any other ethnic group.

 9,In the Devils' last game goalie Martin Brodeur had come in for his rookie backup Mike Dunham after one period with the Devils trailing Anaheim -- and New Jersey had come back to win.Tonight the tables were turned. After a dreadful first period against Buffalo by the usually stalwart Brodeur Dunham started the second period with New Jersey trailing by two goals. Unfortunately for the Devils the result was not the same as the Sabres held off a late flurry and skated to a 6-5 victory in front of 18595 at Marine Midland Arena.''I felt we weren't playing that great and I wanted to give Dunham some ice time too'' Devils Coach Jacques Lemaire said. ''Goaltenders are going to have good games and not so good games. That's the way it is.''The Sabres jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the opening period on just six shots against Brodeur.Brian Holzinger's 12th goal of the season at 4 minutes 8 seconds of the period kicked off the scoring.

 0,There are occasional romantic interludes but the heart of the book involves Johannes Schöffmann an Austrian baker whose passion for obscure varieties of trout exceeds even Prosek's and who leads him through Europe and Central Asia going so far as Mongolia in pursuit of grayling (a cousin of trout). Schöffmann's method swimming underwater in a wet suit equipped with a small net certainly facilitated catch-and-release fishing. Moreover as he explains ''Diving is the only safe way to fish if a warden is around.''Still the prose disappoints in several ways. For one thing the color of trout so handsomely presented in the plates of Prosek's earlier ''Trout: An Illustrated History'' is hardly the stuff of words. Here the few watercolors chiefly show scenery and people and we get for the fish language like this about one caught in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan: ''I marveled at its sparse vermilion and black spots and the gentle daffodil yellow sides.''And while one may welcome the fact that the book is not just a series of highly detailed descriptions of the stealth and wisdom required to bring one courageous trout to the net after another using 6x leaders and size 22 elk-hair caddis flies the accounts of catching fish are almost as lifeless as his scenic descriptions are vivid. Oddly he almost never gives the color of the fly he uses as here in Spain: ''I rigged up my fly rod tying a small dry fly to the line. Then taking care not to hook the branch of one of the scrubby oaks I cast my fly into the pool. It landed softly and floated over where the trout were feeding. One took it gently and swiftly. When it had tired I steered it to my hand and held it.''The best yarn in the book has nothing to do with trout or even the wilderness. Before his searches began in earnest Prosek diverged nearly eight degrees north of the 41st parallel to Paris. There he fished the Seine for weeks trying for silure a catfish of sorts. He surprised himself to say nothing of bystanders and commuters by hauling a 50-pounder onto the Île St.-Louis.

 0,Roy Jones Jr. is 33 years old and talking as if he will retire by the end of next year. It is not so much the opposition says the man still described by many as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. It is his hands. They are still lightning quick but they are also chronically sore.''I've got real bad hands'' Jones said. ''There's a lot of times where I get a guy in a pretty good situation and I've got to chill out. I could knock out a lot of them but then my hands would be broke up so bad I wouldn't be able to fight no more.''Jones the undisputed light heavyweight champion is 45-1 with 36 knockouts. He is a prohibitive favorite against Glen Kelly of Australia on Saturday night at the American Airlines Arena in Miami.As Jones's fame has mushroomed so has his nonboxing schedule. He has played semipro basketball acted in a movie and become a rap artist.
 9,The Quaker Oats Company said yesterday that it would slash 300 salaried sales jobs in the first step of its restructuring. The food company will close as many as 15 field offices and combine its grocery sales divisions into a single group. More cuts are expected at the company's headquarters in Chicago and its research facility in Barrington Ill. but that number has not been disclosed. Only field sales for the Gatorade sports drink and food service divisions will remain independent. On May 16 Quaker Oats said it would take a charge of $110 million to $130 million in the fourth quarter which ended yesterday to cover restructuring in the next 12 to 15 months. Quaker shares fell $1.125 to $69.75 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.

 0,Chad Batka for The New York TimesWith 10 nods for his comeback album “Recovery” Eminem led the nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards which were announced on Wednesday night in a televised ceremony from Los Angeles.Jay-Z Lady Gaga Lady Antebellum and Bruno Mars also racked up plenty of nominations: Jay-Z Lady Gaga and the country band Lady Antebellum had six apiece and Mr. Mars who has sung on his own hits and those of others had seven including several for collaborations.In the album of the year category Eminem’s “Recovery” is up against Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” “The Suburbs” by Arcade Fire” Lady Gaga’s mini-album “The Fame Monster” and the likely wild card Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream.” The competition for best new artist pits Justin Bieber against Drake — both major young hitmakers — along with the jazz bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding and two British bands Florence and the Machine and Mumford & Sons.For years the nominations were usually announced in a drab early-morning press conference. But for a third time the Recording Academy which bestows the awards put together an hourlong show on CBS to prepare audiences for the awards which will be presented in Los Angeles on Feb. 13.Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesLike the recent awards ceremonies the nominations show hosted by LL Cool J was packed with performances. Ms. Perry opened it performing her “California Gurls” in a short silvery dress with a Christmas-ornament-theme headpiece. Miranda Lambert Mr. Mars and the band Train and others played.The television format provided some perhaps unintended comedy. Stevie Wonder seemed surprised by a script that named him as a previous winner of album of the year. And in announcing the nominees for song of the year (a songwriters’ prize) Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and the teen-pop singer Selena Gomez grimaced when mentioning “the song otherwise known as ‘Forget You’ by Cee Lo Green” as Ms. Gomez said. (The title of the song — on which Mr. Green shares songwriting credit with Philip Lawrence and Mr. Mars — contains a blunt profanity.)Also up for song of the year are Eminem’s “Love the Way You Lie” featuring Rihanna (written by Eminem Alexander Grant and Holly Hafferman); “Need You Now” written by Lady Antebellum and Josh Kear; Ray LaMontagne’s “Beg Steal or Borrow”; and Tom Douglas and Allen Shamblin for Ms. Lambert’s song “The House That Built Me.” The nominees for record of the year (which recognizes a track’s performers) are Mr. Green’s song; Eminem’s “Love the Way You Lie”; B.o.B’s “Nothin’ on You” featuring Mr. Mars; Jay-Z and Alicia Keys’s “Empire State of Mind”; and Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now.”Among those with multiple nods are Jeff Beck B.o.B and John Legend with five apiece and Mr. Green Drake Rihanna Ms. Perry Alex da Kid the Black Keys Ari Levine the Roots Dirk Sobotka and Zac Brown with four.The Grammys are voted on by about 12000 members of the Recording Academy who must have credits on at least six commercially released tracks to qualify. An irregularity in the scheduling of the 2010 Grammy ceremony resulted in an unusual 13-month eligibility period this year from Sept. 1 2009 to Sept. 30 2010.
 9,Whatever occurred during a late-night confrontation between two rival casino executives on May 4 it wasn't a crime a municipal judge ruled yesterday dismissing a complaint by Edward M. Tracy that Nicholas L. Ribis had threatened his life. Mr. Ribis who runs the Trump casino operations in Atlantic City had denied making any threat and said he merely asked Mr. Tracy to leave a restaurant at the Taj Mahal casino. Mr. Tracy who now works for another casino company was Mr. Ribis's predecessor as the chief executive of the Trump casinos. JOE SHARKEY

Divide students into six groups. Explain that the class will be preparing a news magazine program celebrating ice cream. Assign each group an ice cream-related topic to research such as History Types and Products Processes and Recipes Alternatives (lactose free tofu-based “Dippin’ Dots” etc.) Economics and Nutritional Facts. Encourage students to use each other for polling and survey information if they plan to include opinions in their portion of the presentation. To guide their search for factual information students may use the following questions (written on the board prior to class for easier student access):HISTORY-When was ice cream invented?-How was ice cream originally made?-What historical or cultural significance does ice cream have?-How has technology influenced the creation and development of ice cream?TYPES AND PRODUCTS-What are the most common types of ice cream?-What are popular ways to serve ice cream?-What are some foods that are used to accompany or decorate ice cream?-What are the various forms sold in your local supermarket? Choose your favorites or most popular and highlight them in your news segment.-What gadgets or tools are associated with ice cream?PROCESSES AND RECIPES-How is milk turned into heavy cream?-How is ice cream mass-produced?-How would you make ice cream in your own home? (Explain the ice-cream maker process if necessary.)-What would a sample ice cream recipe look like?ALTERNATIVE FORMS-Why do ice cream alternatives exist?-What non-dairy ice cream forms are currently mass produced?-Where are these forms sold?-How do each of these alternate forms compare to real ice cream? (Conduct a taste test or survey and tally the results for your portion of the presentation.)ECONOMICS-What is the current price of milk per gallon? How does the cost of milk impact the price of ice cream?-How much does a pint of ice cream cost on average? Examine several brands and list the range.-How much does it cost a particular company to make a pint of ice cream? How does this number compare to the price a consumer pays in the supermarket?-How large is the ice cream industry in the United States? How much did the industry gross last year? Five years ago? How many ice cream stores are located in the United States?-Who are the chief manufacturers of ice cream?NUTRITIONAL FACTS-Under what food group does ice cream fit?-How large is a “single serving” of ice cream?-What are the basic ingredients necessary to make ice cream? For each ingredient analyze its nutritional and caloric value.-How have companies changed the ingredients of ice cream to meet the health and dietary needs of consumers?-Compare the ingredients of the same ice cream flavor made by two different companies such as Breyers Turkey Hill Ben & Jerry’s Hood etc.Once research is completed groups should work to prepare scripts and visuals for their assigned segment for a news magazine program celebrating ice cream. Scripts can be rehearsed and performed for a live news program or taped and viewed in a future class.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually students create public service announcements promoting ice cream consumption. Encourage students to consider the information they researched during class to create their assignments as well as their own personal beliefs about ice cream. Who will be the target audience for the announcement? Where will the ads air? In a future class students may share their creations with peers.Further Questions for Discussion:–What does it mean to say that sundaes are “as messy and as irresistible as democracy itself”?–What ingredients do you like to use in your sundaes?–What is the strangest sundae topping you have ever tried or seen someone else try? Why is it so strange?–When preparing an ice cream snack at home do you consider the temperature of the ice cream or its presentation? Why or why not?–How if at all has this article changed your views about sundaes?–Besides those ingredients listed in the article what else would provide a good crunchy texture for a sundae?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses participation in class and group discussions thorough completion of research visuals and scripts and thoughtful creation of public service announcements.Vocabulary:refinement coupes parfaits ingenuity fleeting tryst surfeit indulged toil availed sophistication stately resonant crucial cleave ephemeral wrested frigid unctuous lulls stabilizers seared aromatic molten amber burnished foil acidity vibrant pallor pectin sequencing tonal embellishments fray dimensions conscience interplay languorExtension Activities:1.

 9,They rented Lake Placid Airport which has been shut all week and converted it into a village three times as big as Lake Placid itself. They created their own bus system and a well-organized parking grid placing the trailers of club officers at the front of the camp.Several Lake Placid officials said the trailer club might be the nicest best-behaved group of 9000 ever to vacation here. These are people brimming over with old-fashioned values. When club members mentioned the Wally Byam Usherettes they usually added ''those lovely ladies'' and when they spoke of the band they called it ''our very own Wally Byam band.''''I have never met a nicer bunch'' said Matthew Clark the Supervisor of the Town of North Elba.They have no religious slant or political philosophy. ''The only cause might be if some injustice was being done to recreational vehicles'' said Lou van Dyck a retired public relations officer for the State of New York and the club spokesman.''We hate when people call us Byamites'' said Frank Sargent a club member for 27 years. ''We're not a cult or anything.''They hate when people say they are snobby. ''Tent campers seem to think Airstreamers like the Cabots and Lodges only speak to God'' Mr. van Dyck said ''so we work hard speaking to everyone.''A 100-Member Police ForceJim Creel a retired teacher who heads the unarmed 100-member all-volunteer Wally Byam police force said he never heard of a participant at a major rally being arrested. A big problem he said is old people getting sick at rallies. Eight men who signed up to be members of the force had to cancel. ''It was mostly heart problems or falls'' Mr. Creel said.Club members are in plain words people who like to drive to new places in trailers park a while renew old friendships and meet new people who like doing the exact same thing.

 0,Readers respond to Thomas Friedman’s Mar. 1 column “Who’s Afraid of a Gas Tax?“Sherm Gallay Lee N.Y.: Can you get a voting majority of Americans to make a deliberate sacrifice which directly affects their pocketbooks? I would like to hope so but I don’t think so. Your pro-tax stump speech is compelling and accurate but I don’t think it will have broad appeal.You know there is one easy cost-free way to immediately reduce fuel consumption — enforce speed limits. A vehicle traveling at 65 miles per hour gets 10-20 more miles per gallon than one traveling at 75 m.p.h. In most states I’ve driven through the cops will give you about 10 m.p.h. over the limit before giving a ticket.Now if national leadership were to request that the states strictly enforce the speed limits but not change them there would be a quick and lasting reduction in fuel consumption. Would the American people go along with this rather painless proposition? I wouldn’t bet on it. Of course there would have to be real national leadership to even try it.Tom Sandusky Spring Hill Fla.: You cannot just propose a huge gas tax. Most people live from paycheck to paycheck. It has to be an integrated approach. First the government has to announce that a gas tax is going to be imposed increasing a small amount per year until you get to a target year in order to give people a chance to adjust. Second along with the increase in gas taxes the government has to increase fuel efficiency standards to help offset the cost of higher taxes.Sam Uretsky Wantagh N.Y.: The importance of developing alternative energy sources can’t be overstated but is a gasoline tax — ultimately a retrogressive tax — the best answer? People with the highest incomes could easily ignore it and continue to drive Hummers. People with low incomes might be unable to afford to buy an alternative fuel vehicle and be penalized. I’m uncertain whether any suitable alternative vehicles are currently available for handicapped conversion. Using tax policy as the prime mover of public policy simply seems like an inappropriate approach.I don’t have an all-purpose solution but a combination of inducements might help. Perhaps an initial tax break could be offered to corporate fleets using alternative fuels along with specifications for alternative fuels to be used in government vehicles at all levels. As these cars enter the used car market they would be more affordable for lower-income individuals thus permitting a gasoline tax to operate in a more equitable manner. Conversion kits might be made available for cars now on the road to permit increased use of biodiesel and gasohol without the need to buy a new vehicle. Increased subsidies for mass transit would also be a plus.It’s a national shame that we didn’t listen to President Carter when he developed an energy plan but perhaps this time we’ll learn.Michael Siteman Agoura Hills Calif.: I agree with you that by raising the tax and therefore creating higher gasoline prices at the pump we create a commercially feasible environment for proliferation of alternative fuels. My only concern regarding increasing the gasoline tax is that the government especially the current administration will squander the additional revenue.Frank Auer Stratford Conn.: You seem to have little concern for the poor and middle classes that have to drive and can’t afford hybrid cars. I drive 60 miles a day for work and others I know would really be hurt by a gas tax. How about a graduated tax on new cars based on mileage? Or putting those oil-company and rich-people tax cuts to use for research? Or eliminating the cuts and using the money for mass transportation improvements? It’s always the poor and middle classes who get stuck being the responsible citizens.Mike Flanigan Chevy Chase Md.: I applaud your focus on raising the gas tax and on our energy policy in general. But I think you should take more care in what you propose as alternatives to imported oil. Today you promoted hybrids that run on biofuels such as ethanol. The last time I looked at the issue a number of studies indicate that if corn is the source of the ethanol it takes more energy to produce a quantity of ethanol than we get out of the product. The other sources of biofuels are really in their infancy.Oliver Patton Alexandria Va.: I have followed your campaign for higher fuel taxes with great interest. It’s an important idea that needs to be fully aired.Two questions:1. How do we know that $4 a gallon will in fact change consumer decision-making? I understand the obvious answer — that people will look for other ways to lower their costs — but maybe that doesn’t happen in a serious way until we’re paying $10 a gallon. I don’t think you can look to European tax policy as an example because their geographic circumstances are so different from ours. My point is: it is critically important that the number be right. If you ask me to double or triple my automotive expenses for a specific cause I expect to see results pretty quickly. Otherwise you’ve got a political donnybrook on your hands. And you need to have agreement on what the federal government will do with all that money. Should all of it go into the Highway Trust Fund — we do need to do something about congestion — or should a portion of it go to say a new nuclear submarine every year or to a new gym for the House of Representatives?2. I also have a question regarding your assertion that we need to stop hitting ourselves in the face by sending money over to oil-exporting nations that either directly or indirectly support the terrorist tactics of radical Islam. I couldn’t agree more. But if we stopped buying oil from those nations tomorrow — stopped cold — it would make no significant difference in their income. Oh there would be a downturn in their revenue for a while but India and China would make up the gap in short order. So the money would still be there. We’d have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not funding our enemies but they’d still be funded. Am I missing something?Richard Moore Albany N.Y.: While I agree with your assessment of the energy crisis and am in favor of a significant increase in the gasoline tax I should point out that I agree because I can afford to agree. It wasn’t that long ago however that I commuted 70 miles round trip because I couldn’t afford a house in or near Princeton N.J. where I worked. Actually few who live in Princeton work in Princeton — business owners and old money exceptions notwithstanding. I now live within walking and biking distance of my work and a tank of gas lasts around a month. But I’m still very concerned about our gluttony for energy.What I believe we need is a two-pronged approach to energy independence. First as you point out a realistic gasoline tax would encourage commuters to carpool or find other means to get to work. This leads me to my second element — put that additional money into improving mass transit and making it easier for people to walk or ride bicycles to their place of business. As I said I can walk to work — but the route is along a heavily-traveled road with cars and trucks whizzing by me an arm’s length away. Why not put down a 6-foot wide asphalt path along every road deemed a commuter route? It would certainly make it easier for me and I’d wager that a great number of people who live even farther out would ride bicycles or walk. And it would be easy. I don’t get it.Anyway that’s my opinion.Kathy Ann Walsh Scottsdale Ariz.: I understand and agree with your logic about the long-range effect that raising the gas tax would have in forcing auto makers to greatly improve fuel efficiency. And I realize that for upper-middle-class people and above it would be a cost they could absorb without too much suffering. But I think there are an awful lot of people in this country who would be devastated by prices that high especially in places that lack decent mass transit. Some of them would not be able to afford to get to their jobs. Some small-business owners like landscapers who must use a vehicle in their businesses would not always be able to pass the cost along to their customers. I don’t think tax breaks for the poor would be quick enough so what else?

 0,The Jets hardly had the most challenging schedule this season but they did beat the Patriots at New England where they’ll return Sunday for a playoff game.It was the Jets’ most impressive victory of the season. A seemingly gleeful Ron Borges of The Boston Globe described it this way.(Borges has been a fierce critic of Bill Belichick not easy to do when a guy wins three Super Bowl titles in four years.)After the game the Patriots’ Richard Seymour with no points for originality said “We got outplayed and we got outcoached.” There is an accompanying video link in which Belichick engages in his least favorite activity: talking to reporters after a loss.Also from The Globe by Jim McBride today:Five things Patriots fans should know about the Jets:1. Chad Pennington is smart: The Jets quarterback won’t bowl you over with a great arm or great mobility. Instead he wins games by making good decisions. Pennington is a true field general who takes what the defense gives him and rarely gambles. He reads defenses quickly and is at his best when he’s picking you apart with short and intermediate throws. He’ll never be confused with a gunslinger such as Peyton Manning but he can be lethal just the same.2. They have excellent receivers: Laveranues Coles and Jerricho Cotchery complement each other well. Coles is the speed burner. The 5-11 193-pounder is stronger than he looks and has a ton of moves after the catch. Cotchery lacks speed but knows how to get open. He works hard to gain separation and won’t shy away when things get physical. Neither Coles nor Cotchery are particularly effective blockers.3. Jonathan Vilma’s a monster: One of the game’s great inside linebackers the 6-1 230-pound beast will be all over your television screen come Sunday. Vilma uses his exceptional hands to not only shed blockers quickly but to inflict punishment on ball carriers. Vilma excels at reading and reacting and forces teams to run outside where wingmen Eric Barton and Victor Hobson clean up any leftovers.4. They have fresh legs: In the absence of a true horse in the backfield the Jets go with “tailback by committee.” Rookie Leon Washington is the most consistent of the bunch. The 5-8 202-pound sparkplug runs with great balance and decent speed. Injury-prone Kevan Barlow is a between-the-tackles slasher who shows flashes but too often disappears for long stretches. Cedric Houston has been battling a calf injury but can be sneaky fast.5. You’re going to be sick of this storyline: By the time Sunday rolls around fans will be fed up with the Bill Belichick-Eric Mangini hype. Yes Mangini learned a lot from Belichick and yes there appears to be tension between the former friends/co-workers. Both coaches are very familiar with their opponent but it’s the players who have to execute the game plans. It all should make for another interesting midfield meeting when the final gun sounds.
 9,Starting Monday curtains are going up earlier at many theater ‐ district restaurants too.Broadway's change of cur tain time from 8:30 to 7:30 P.M. will mean a change in dining‐out patterns and the restaurateurs who cater to the playgoing throngs are bracing for it with new menus and serving hours.They have been going ahead with their plans de spite some antagonism to the changed time. “We feel it's wrong as an industry but we'll support it” Vincent Sardi owner of Sardi's res taurant 234 West 44th Street said recently. The qualified support was the stand of a recently formed unofficial alliance of a dozen or so theater district restaurant owners.Mr. Sardi expects that most theater patrons will arrive an hour earlier than usual from 5:30 to 6 P.M. for pretheater dining. A new menu at Sardi's will offer a choice of seven pretheater “mini‐dinners” consisting of a main dish such as chicken Sardi or canneloni with vegetables dessert and cof fee. The main dishes have been selected from popular items on the regular menu. Sardi's will switch to their late supper menu at 9:30 P.M. about an hour earlier than usual.The biggest innovation seems to be at nine of the Restaurant Associates opera tions—The Four Seasons the new La Fonda del Sol The Forum of the Twelve Caesars Mama Leone's Charley O's Bar and Grill Brasserie Trat toria Charlie Brown's and Promenade Cafe.

 9,Hilly Kristal founder and owner of the seminal East Village punk club CBGB called the policy unfortunate. "I would take each request separately" he said. "The music itself does not stir up anything terrible and a lot of these kids who come to see it and listen to it are fine. There can be 500 people and maybe 10 or 15 who cause the trouble." Verifying NamesAlthough the city has many restrictions on large events held in public spaces especially Central Park until yesterday the Parks Department had dealt loosely with smaller events.It has not required photo identification cards so that the city could verify the name and address of a permit seeker.The city has always made concert promoters post bonds on average of $250 for cleanup. If the organizers failed to restore parks to their original state they forfeited the money. But the $250 was low compared to the real cost Mr. Stern said.Under the changes he said the city will have greater flexibility in imposing higher cleanup bonds -- as high as $5000 -- on high-risk concerts and locations. "If there's a history of violence or failure to clean up the bond will go up" he said.John Miller deputy commissioner of public information for the police said the department does not keep statistics on the violence rates of one group of music fan versus another. "We can't characterize one form of art as causing more aggression than another -- albeit we haven't seen Mozart fans looting on the streets."Parks officials said Summerfest had a permit to showcase local heavy metal rap and punk rock bands from 2 to 6 P.M. Because of technical difficulties said Susan Alexander an organizer the concert began late and with the agreement of the police ended at 6:17 P.M. The authorities do not dispute this point but disagree on what ensued.

 0,Sam Greenwood/Getty Images left; Andy Lyons/Getty ImagesIf we forget about the controversy surrounding each of these programs over the past 30 days — Brian Kelly leaving for Notre Dame Urban Meyer’s health scare and ongoing coaching future — this game is as exciting as any bowl this season. On one hand you have the Big East champion Bearcats who sport one of the most prolific exciting offenses in the country. Cincinnati’s rapid ascension from F.B.S. afterthought to Big East power has been one of the best stories of this decade. Florida is running low after a loss to Alabama in the SEC championship which prevented the Gators from playing for yet another national championship but the Gators are clearly one of the best teams in the country. Of course this is the final collegiate game for quarterback Tim Tebow who we will all miss — whether you want to admit it or not. It may be difficult for both teams to forget about the off-field news but if we’re lucky once this game gets underway we will see two of the top teams in the nation.Allstate Sugar BowlFriday 8:30 p.m. FoxCincinnatiLost in the recent developments in both Gainesville and Lubbock has been the emotion flowing from the Cincinnati program following Brian Kelly’s departure for Notre Dame. If you have forgotten — and no one would blame you — there was a massive sense of anger and resentment from the Cincinnati players after Kelly broke the news; these Bearcats may play their best game of the season merely to spite their former coach if not to complete a perfect season. Stepping in for Kelly in this game is Kerry Coombs a former Ohio high school coach and the current U.C. defensive backs coach and assistant head coach. The offensive coordinator Jeff Quinn will continue to call plays while creating the team’s game plan before leaving to take the coaching job at Buffalo. Thanks for hanging around coach. He will have countless weapons to work with many of whom have burst upon the national scene thanks to Cincinnati’s undefeated regular season. One is quarterback Tony Pike who threw for 2350 yards and 26 touchdowns despite missing at least a portion of four games. His favorite target is the fantastic receiver Mardy Gilyard (80 receptions for 1150 yards) who also makes an impact on special teams. One area of concern for the Bearcats is on defense which despite being ranked in the top 50 in most statistical categories has struggled in recent weeks. Giving up 44 points to Pittsburgh is cause for concern.FloridaOne fear for Florida is a letdown. Last season’s Sugar Bowl saw Utah beat an Alabama team that like Florida was coming off a loss in the SEC title game that cost the Tide a shot at the national championship. One difference of course is that Cincinnati enters this game with a slightly better resume than did Utah meaning Florida may be less likely to come out flat. One reason why the Gators won’t? Tim Tebow obviously. Tebow’s wonderful college career — like him or hate him — wraps up here and the former Heisman Trophy winner will certainly have the Gators ready to play. One reason why the Gators will come out flat? The hysteria surrounding Urban Meyer’s retirement and comeback. While Meyer will be coaching the game tonight the focus his surreal waffling placed upon the program can only serve as a distraction. Having said that because of the combination of this being the final game for both Tebow and countless other Gators and the potential motivation of Meyer’s impending departure it would not surprise me in the least to see the best effort Florida has put forth all season.Know Your SponsorAllstateWe’re all in good hands with Allstate which has sponsored the Sugar Bowl since 2007. Unfortunately Allstate has yet to see a competitive Sugar Bowl: 2007 saw L.S.U. beat Notre Dame by 41-14 2008 featured Georgia’s 41-10 destruction of Hawaii and last season as mentioned saw Utah upset Alabama. More bad news: the American Association of Justice ranks Allstate as the nation’s worst insurer. The most damaging quote from the A.A.J.’s press release? “One Allstate employee reported that supervisors told agents to lie and blame fires on arson and in turn were rewarded with portable fridges.”Pick ‘EmPete: Florida. Tim Tebow leaves with a decisive final victory as Cincinnati hasn’t stopped anyone lately.Thayer: Florida. This game won’t cause Urban Meyer any chest pains.Paul: Florida. This game really would have been something without the off-field news of the past month.Fred: Florida. Lots going on in this one other than football but I think the Gators are just more talented than Cincinnati. I also don’t see Tim Tebow losing his final collegiate game.Connor: Florida. The Bearcats have given up a lot of points all season and this time they won’t be able to make up the difference on offense.Records Through Dec. 31Connor: 44-26 (regular season); 10-10 (bowls)Thayer: 44-26; 11-9Paul: 43-27; 10-10Pete: 43-27; 10-10Fred: 43-27; 11-9

Mr. Vega was detained just 30 minutes after the shooting but the case has dragged on through years of adjournments and three trials.

 9,To the Editor:What explains the current violence in Burundi? "Specter of Hate Stalks Burundi Too" (news article April 26) focuses on two causes: President Melchior Ndadaye's assassination last October and the assessment by Sylvie Kinigi who was Prime Minister under Mr. Ndadaye and briefly head of state that "a democratic system [ was ] thrust upon her country too abruptly" by the Belgians. This perspective however overlooks one driving influence: genocide.In two years of research with Burundi refugees in Tanzania I observed how the genocide carried out by the Tutsi-dominated Burundi Government in 1972-73 continues to captivate Burundian thoughts.It could hardly be otherwise: in 1972 responding to an armed Hutu uprising President Michel Micombero a Tutsi violently eliminated a generation of educated Hutus from Burundi drove hundreds of thousands out of the country and enacted measures to discriminate against surviving Hutus. Apartheid-like conditions prevailed until quite recently in Burundian society.The wound that genocide inflicted on Burundians has festered for two decades. Government-induced ethnic repression polarized post-genocide Burundi along the Hutu-Tutsi divide and Burundians have used the genocide to validate their respective ethnic histories and demonize the opposition.

 9,The resulting portrayal is of Washington as the ambitious yet reluctant leader. He turns away from power at nearly every critical moment in his career starting from the end of his military service. He did not want to be Virginia's delegate to the Constitutional Convention nor the nation's first president and he did not want to serve a second term. He was melancholy and from today's perspective unduly pessimistic about how the experiment that was the United States would turn out.''Our Affairs generally seem really to be approaching to some awful crisis'' he wrote Knox from the Constitutional Convention in 1787. ''God only knows what the result will be. It shall be my part to hope for the best; as to see this Country happy whilst I am gliding down the stream of life in tranquil retirement is so much the wish of my Soul.''There are letters in which Washington agonizes over his ownership of slaves including correspondence in which he considers leasing Mount Vernon to as he obliquely put it ''liberate a certain species of property which I possess very repugnantly to my own feelings.'' The slaves were not freed until the execution of Washington's will which can also be viewed as a published pamphlet at the Morgan. At times Washington's sentiments seemed conflicted: in another letter he advises a friend on ways to trick an escaped slave back into service.Washington's correspondence here is unfailingly fascinating. A letter from the battlefield finds Washington the general begging for gunpowder to arm his troops. Later he turns to a neighbor for a loan to pay for the trip to his Inauguration. ''Never 'till within these last two yrs I have experienced the want of money'' he wrote. ''Under this statement I am inclined to do what I have never expected to be reduced to the necessity of doing -- that is to borrow money upon interest.'' Washington found himself in these straits partly because he declined a salary while commanding the Continental Army though he did file an expense account. He claimed $64335.30 over eight and half years including reimbursement for his laundry.Often it is the medium itself -- the written letter -- that is the most stirring aspect of this exhibition starting with those written by Washington but also including some of his contemporaries. Martha Washington wrote from her camp outside Boston in the winter of 1775 ''Some days we have a number of Cannon and shells from Boston and Bunkers Hill but it does not seem to surprise anyone but me; I confess I shudder every time I hear the sound of a gun.''And John Adams an aging man writing in a cramped hand offers a rather prickly judgment of Washington after his death. In words that resonate today Adams describes the first president as one of the ''great masters of the theatrical exhibitions of politics.'' He added ''Washington understood this art very well and we may say of him if he was not the greatest President he was the best actor of Presidency we have ever had.''
 9,WHEN Joan Fleming received the Crime Writers Association's top award last year for “When I Grow Rich” I was delighted not only by this prize for one of my own favorite suspense novels but by the overdue recognition of the author herself a consistently admirable and versatile maker whose entire corpus of novels is a distinguished one. As I have often remarked she never writes the same book twice but even she reaches a new extent of versatility in THE CHILL AND THE KiLL (Washburn $3.95) which should be eagerly claimed by the science‐fiction enthusiasts as well as by the suspense buffsFor this is about a genuine case of extrasensory perception particularly precognition. A hitherto unexceptional adolescent girl develops after the shock of a minor accident a wild talent for foretelling the future: marriages arrivals deaths and a murder. But such startling aperçus are often imperfect; and when the foreseen murder happens even the young prophetess does not know whodunit. This is an adroit plot for combining mystery and s.f. (though Miss Fleming and Dr. J. B. Rhine might argue that E.S.P. should by now be classed as recognized fact) and the treatment is excellent—a fine depiction of an English village rich in complex and unstereo typed characters including the sensitively drawn E.S.P.er herself.One of fiction's best private detectives solidly and humanly in the Hammett (rather than the Spillane) tradition is the Chicago eye whose only name is Mac. In Thomas B. Dewey's DON'T CRY FOR LONG (Simon & Schuster $3.50) he becomes accidentally (and without pay) involved in the affairs of a controversial Congressman with a sexy and treacherous daughter. Strong suspense hard action firm characterizations.Lighter variants of the private eye: Shell Scott encounters on an Arizona dude ranch a gaggle of gangsters and the all‐female cast of a nude Western film in Richard S. Prather's THE COCKEYED CORPSE (Gold Medal 40 cents). The action is as briskly entertaining as the title is irrelevant. . . . Rick Holman in Carter Brown's MURDER IS A PACKAGE DEAL (Signet 40 cents) undertakes to free a fading filmstar from blackmail and walks into two murders. Conventonal but fast with a few nice macabre touches . . . Mavis Seidlitz in order to protect a threatened stripper turns stripper herself in Carter Brown's TIHE BUMP AND GRINND lMURDERS (Signet 40 cents). Some of Mavis's Gracie ‐ Allen ‐ plus sex humor is as strained as her bra‐straps; but the plot culminates in a fine sequence of double and triple crosses.

 0,John Faso accepting the Republican nomination in June. (James Estrin/The New York Times) John Faso accepting the Republican nomination in June. (James Estrin/The New York Times)John Faso not only responded to his being labeled an “Andrew” yesterday but he also spent time discussing his property tax cut plan. At a news conference he labeled Eliot Spitzer’s plan which calls for a $6 billion property tax cut over three years a “tax increase.”How does he come up with that? Because Mr. Faso’s own plan offers tax cuts only to school districts that cap spending increases while Mr. Spitzer’s has no spending cap Mr. Faso says that Mr. Spitzer’s cuts will be overtaken by school spending increases. On the other hand New York City is not expected to stay within his proposed cap which calls for annual spending increases of no more than 4 percent.— Danny Hakim
 0,Asked whether he was directing the Florida Legislature's leaders Mr. Bush replied ''We're both being kept abreast of the options and opportunities. I decided that it was best to take our case to the Supreme Court of the United States which will be heard tomorrow. All options are on the table but one of our strategies is to get this election ratified and the sooner the better for the good of the country.''The select committee made up of eight Republicans and six Democrats voted along party lines after two hours of impassioned debate this morning. Each side warned that history would judge the other harshly and each side contended that it was acting in defense of Florida's voters without regard to the presidential ambitions of either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush. Although members strained to maintain a polite tone there was no disguising the partisan fury that has infused both sides.''What the hell is going on?'' Tom Rossin the leading Democrat in the state Senate asked the committee this morning. ''Is this America? Is this democracy? Is this the legacy we want for our children?''Another Democratic senator Betty S. Holzendorf of Jacksonville said she was so disgusted by the whole affair that she planned to skip the special session. ''I'm going on vacation'' she said.For their part Republicans accused Democrats of ignoring their oath of office of shirking their constitutional obligations and of putting Mr. Gore's interests ahead of an entire state. The Democrats they asserted were aiding Mr. Gore in an effort to tie up Florida's election results in court challenges so that he would win by default with a majority of the remaining electoral votes.''Since our motives -- the motives of the majority -- have been presumably exposed by some members of the committee maybe this exposes the alternative motive which is to elect Vice President Gore by our own inaction'' said Senator Daniel Webster a Republican. ''Today is the day to act.''Fully aware of polls showing the political risks of intervening Mr. Webster and other Republican members said they regretted calling for a special session. But they said they had felt compelled to act because of uncertainty which they blamed entirely on recent election rulings by the Florida Supreme Court and on Mr. Gore's decision to contest the results. Those actions they said had placed the outcome of Florida's election in doubt and thus posed a ''significant risk'' that Florida's six million voters would not be represented in the Electoral College.

 9,LOS ANGELES Nov 1—Twenty former executives and employes of the bankrupt Equity Funding Corporation of America and two of the company's former auditors were accused today in a 105‐count indictment handed down by a Federal grand jury.The indictments followed a seven‐month investigation of one of the biggest business scandals in history involving the manufacturing of an estimated $120‐million in fictitious assets and the creation through computer manipulation of some 60000 bogus life‐insurance policies for nonexistent persons. The same defendants were named in an indictment also handed down today in DuPage Ill. where Equity's subsidiary the Equity Life Insurance Company is chartered.Heading the list of defendants is Stanley Goldbaum the 46‐year‐old former chairman and president of Equity and Fred Levin 40 and Samuel B. Lowell 34 both former executive vice presidents.The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to commit securities fraud filing of false documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission bank fraud interstate transportation of securities taken by fraud interstate transportation of counterfeit securities and electronic eavesdropping. Defendants also are charged with specific acts of commission.
 9,It was the turn of the inconsistent Devils to play well and tonight they did so in smashing fashion knocking off the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins 7-4 at the Civic Arena.Scott Stevens and Valery Zelepukin led the Devils with two goals apiece. Aleksei Kasatonov Laurie Boschman and Dave Barr (empty net) also had goals for New Jersey which posted its first victory in its last nine games against Patrick Division opponents.Kevin Stevens Jaromir Jagr Mario Lemieux and Joey Mullen had the goals for the Penguins against Craig Billington who made 24 saves and improved his record to 7-1-1.The victory for the Devils took on an extra dimension because of the recent success of the Penguins. Pittsburgh scored 30 goals and allowed only 9 in its previous 4 games all victories and the Penguins were on the move into the top of the division. Tops in Goals
 0,It was mighty quiet at the Coffee Station on Wednesday.Too quiet especially for the townspeople and tourists who lined up along the walls inside what is Crawford's only diner for a glimpse of the town's most famous resident who usually comes for a cheeseburger to ring out the old year.This year President Bush was a no-show.Maybe it was Code Orange. Or maybe Mr. Bush who has not been seen in public since he arrived here Friday and headed into his 1600-acre ranch did not want to answer questions about mad cows his attorney general or his New Year's resolutions. Whatever the reason a president who was remarkably chatty this time last year -- taking reporters on a brisk hike and answering questions about North Korea and Saddam Hussein in the diner's parking lot -- was nowhere to be seen.The disappointment was palpable inside the Coffee Station which like Iraq is under new management since Mr. Bush's last New Year's visit. Doug Cheatham a Texan who moved to Connecticut years ago brought his wife Zora and other family members well before noon. They scanned the crowd looking for tell-tale signs including Secret Service agents. There were a few -- but they were coming for lunch without their protectee.Diners had to sign up for a table. Words rarely spoken inside -- ''Brown table of two we're ready for you'' -- were shouted above the din as scores hoped to score a table next to the president's.
 0,Andrew H. Walker/Getty ImagesWhat makes a music festival reflect the place where it’s being held? Historically that connection has been key to its success. In the 1960s Woodstock and Monterey Pop crystallized the hippie subcultures of the East and West Coasts. More recently Bonnaroo in Tennessee gives a bucolic home to the jam bands that have always had one foot in Southern rock and Coachella captures the stylish mix of indie rock and dance music endemic to Southern California.What about All Points West? It’s produced by the people behind Coachella and for the last two years the big question has been whether it would have its own distinct character or be merely a smaller imitation of Coachella. (Well the convenience of the ferries may have been a more immediate concern.)In some ways All Points West succeeds beautifully at framing a New York-centric event. Jay-Z was an inspired booking and there is a strain of New York hip-hop historicism running through the lineup with Q-Tip Organized Konfusion and Kool Keith. It’s also not hard to find young New York rock bands: MGMT Vampire Weekend the National. Hip-hop is the exception here however not the rule and for every of-the-moment Brooklyn art-rock band that is NOT on the bill (Animal Collective Dirty Projectors Grizzly Bear) there are another two or three from England or Texas or Sweden. But is that a good thing or a bad thing? New York is cosmopolitan and omnivorous in every way. A festival that reflects our tastes should be like a United Nations of pop music. Right?

 0,Historians will measure the presidency of George H.W. Bush in familiar ways — by how well or poorly he managed the major domestic and international challenges of his time his leadership qualities the moral and social legacies he left for future generations.Yet at the moment of his passing it is difficult not to take note of the profound differences between the 41st president of the United States and the current occupant of the White House Donald Trump. Beyond a desire to be president — Mr. Bush was more competitive and ambitious than his self-effacing personality sometimes suggested — there is almost nothing in common: the one gracious and modest the other rude and vain; the one prudent the other brash; the one steady the other unmoored.Mr. Bush’s death on Friday is also a moment to recall a less quarrelsome political order when relations with traditional allies were more cordial than combative when government attracted people of talent and integrity for whom public service offered a purpose higher than self-enrichment when the Republican Party though slowly slipping into the tentacles of zealots like Newt Gingrich still offered room for people with pragmatic policies and sensible dispositions.Mr. Bush’s tenure was shorter than he had hoped and ended ingloriously in a lopsided defeat at the hands of an upstart governor from Arkansas Bill Clinton presaged by a huge drop in Mr. Bush’s approval rating from nearly 90 percent at the time of the 1991 Gulf War to the mid-30s in the summer before the election. Fingers pointed in every direction after his defeat — a deteriorating economy a divisive convention in Houston a disjointed campaign. But one big reason for Mr. Bush’s precipitous fall was Mr. Bush himself chiefly his inability to convince Americans that he understood the depth of their fears or could summon up a coherent plan for addressing them.

 9,This week the Mashantucket Pequot Indians will open a new building that will double the size of their Foxwoods casino. But even before the expansion the tribe has become the region's clear center of gravity with influence that extends from town halls to the State Capitol in Hartford.In a small town used to small business the casino's numbers speak for themselves. The Pequots made $26 million in gross profits in July just on slot machines. By year's end they expect to be one of the largest employers in the state with 9000 workers. Their new building will give the tribe 139000 square feet of gambling space. They say this will give them the largest gambling operation in the Western Hemisphere edging out the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City which claims to be the largest casino in the world. The power of all that money to buy up land has non-Indian residents worried.Last month in response to an inquiry from the three nearest towns -- Ledyard Preston and North Stonington -- the Pequots said their long-term goal was to buy 8000 acres and annex it to the reservation more than quintupling the 1850 acres of Federal trust land in the reservation's original boundary. The new lands would all but encircle the town halls of Ledyard and Preston."It's too much" said Ledyard's Mayor Joseph A. Lozier. But Mr. Lozier who describes himself as "pro-Indian" and "pro-Indian economic development" concedes that the growing power of the Pequots is not to be denied in the town of 15000 population. "When you're making $26 million a month it's you know what do you want this week?" Mr. Lozier said.

 0,Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is getting support from some high-flying financiers as he considers whether to run for president in 2008. Data published on Wednesday by PoliticalMoneyLine.com show that contributors to Mr. Giuliani’s presidential exploratory committee formed in November include T. Boone Pickens the Texas mogul who runs the hedge fund BP Capital Management; and Paul Tudor Jones II the chairman of the hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation. The fund also got money from Carl C. Icahn the billionaire investor filings show.Mr. Pickens and Mr. Jones were ranked No. 2 and No. 5 respectively in Alpha magazine’s listing of the most highly paid hedge fund managers of 2005. Mr. Icahn is one of the best-known activist investors on Wall Street.Mr. Pickens Mr. Jones and Mr. Icahn each gave $2100 to the fund called the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee according to PoliticalMoneyLine. (Update: Under campaign finance law at the time of these donations $2100 was the maximum an individual could contribute to a candidate in a single election.)Mr. Giuliani drew a lot of financial support from Mr. Pickens’ Dallas-based firm BP Capital. Employees there contributed a total of $18900 to his exploratory fund.Elliott Associates a hedge fund founded by Paul E. Singer one of Mr. Giuliani’s primary fund-raisers has also been one of Mr. Giuliani’s biggest supporters. Employees of Elliott Associates gave a combined $14700 to the fund filings show.In all Mr. Giuliani’s fund said it raised about $1.4 million between Nov. 15 and Dec. 31.In a Jan. 25 article The New York Times’s Landon Thomas Jr. wrote about the increasing importance of hedge fund money for those with political aspirations:Hedge fund money which now exceeds $1 trillion has emerged in the last several years as a potentially powerful force in politics as underscored by the significant role it is playing in the presidential aspirations of [Hillary Rodham] Clinton and Mr. Giuliani. During the 2006 election cycle executives who work at the 30 biggest hedge funds made $2.8 million in contributions to political candidates or party committees almost double the amount in 2000. Yet it is not just the money they donate directly that makes people in hedge funds attractive to campaigns. They also offer access to other potential donors in the financial world which in recent election cycles has become one of the biggest sources of political contributions.Go to Report from PoliticalMoneyLine.com »Go to Previous Article from The New York Times »Go to Related Article from the Associated Press via The New York Times »

 9,Coming up also is the first of three weekends to take children to Caramoor. Each of the ''Trio of Fairy Tales'' which is sponsored by General Foods will be given four times - on Fridays and Saturdays at 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. The first is ''Pinocchio'' on July 6 and 7. It is followed on July 13 and 14 by ''Hansel and Gretel'' both of those featuring the life-sized puppets and marionettes of Puppetworks.Then on July 27 and 28 Artreach an award-winning touring theater company brings a live production of ''Rumpelstiltskin'' to the Spanish Courtyard.For reservations to any of the above Caramoor events call 232-5035.The 13th year of free events at the Untermyer Performing Arts Festival is about to begin at the historic Untermyer Park in Yonkers. The first of the six 8 P.M. Saturday concerts presents the Haydn-Mozart Chamber Orchestra. The attractions in subsequent weeks are to be ''The Traveling Russian Village'' two dance evenings a choral program and the Opera Northeast production of Puccini's ''Madame Butterfly.'' Saunders Auditorium is the rain location; for more information call 964-3513.Although a number of summer festivals emulate the Untermyer by alternating dance and concert events Music in the Mountains seems to be the only one offering them in a single evening. This experiment in interdisciplinary programming was tried successfully last year so now there will be two such mixed evenings this Saturday and July 21 on the New Paltz campus of the State University of New York.At the first of these 8 P.M. concerts the Festival Chamber Players share the spotlight with Sarah Stackhouse and Dancers the program listing Ravel's Duo for Violin and Cello the Bartok Contrasts Joan Tower's ''Wings'' for solo dancer and clarinet and George Crumb's eerily fascinating ''Voice of the Whale'' the last with new choreography by Ms. Stackhouse. On July 21 the Chamber Players team up with members of the Jean Erdman Theater of Dance (257-3872).Well worth the trip are the Maverick Concerts in Woodstock N.Y. which are celebrating their 75th anniversary season with 10 Sunday afternoons of chamber music in a sylvan setting.Next week at 3 P.M. the violinist Charles Libove the cellist Roberta Cooper and the pianist Nina Lugovoy will re-create the first Maverick program of July 9 1916 when the music list included piano solos of Schumann and Chopin Christian Sinding's Suite for Violin and Piano the Valentini E major Cello Sonata and trios of Beethoven and Arensky.Among the subsequent performers of renown this summer are the Emerson String Quartet (on July 22) the flute-harpsichord duo of Paula Robison and Kenneth Cooper (Aug. 5) and Brass Ring (Aug. 12). The grand finale on Sept. 2 brings members of the Composers String Quartet and the Dorian Wind Quintet together for the world premiere of an octet by Peter Schickele one of five works commissioned to help celebrate Maverick's Diamond Jubilee season.

 0,LET us accept Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's contention that she was completely uninvolved in the presidential pardon of Marc Rich a fugitive commodities trader accused of tax evasion. Ditto the former president's decision to reduce the sentences of four Hasidic men from New Square N.Y. who were convicted of defrauding the government.The facts argue for a more cynical interpretation since Mr. Rich's former wife Denise is a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who pleaded her ex's case to Bill Clinton. She is so generous that she even gave the Clintons more than $7000 worth of furniture for their new homes. And New Square in Rockland County is the only Hasidic community in the state (each votes as a bloc) to overwhelmingly support Mrs. Clinton. Then after the election Mrs. Clinton attended a White House meeting between the men's supporters and her husband; Mr. Clinton subsequently commuted the original sentences of 30 to 78 months to terms of 24 to 30 months.So the facts do seem to undermine Mrs. Clinton's assertions of disinterest but even if she was indeed above the fray even politically naïve she still has a problem -- a big one. That problem is one of perception. It sure looks as if the junior senator has benefited from a quid pro quo and she has done little to dispel that dangerous impression.Politics has its own ethic and language and Mr. Clinton's leniency has given those of us on the outside a big fat glimpse of how things really work. The world of New York politics especially on the Democratic side is abuzz about the pardons the senator and her presumed role.
 9,Television for all its awesome reach has an ephemeral touch. Even the best programs rarely leave footprints in libraries archives indexes or books. It is harder to retrieve the transcript of a documentary seen by millions than to unearth an obscure magazine article read by thousands.Who remembers for example an ambitious four-part CBS documentary called "The Warren Report" broadcast just 25 years ago? It was apparently overlooked by the American Medical Association which claimed in May that two pathologists Dr. James J. Humes and Dr. J. Thornton Boswell had broken a 28-year silence to discuss their autopsy on President Kennedy.In truth Dr. Humes had offered essentially the same defense of the Warren Commission's forensic findings when he was interviewed by CBS 25 years ago. I only learned of this during a chance encounter with Leslie Midgley the program's executive producer who has been following with bemused detachment the uproar over Oliver Stone's recent film "J.F.K."The documentary yields other surprises. Take the famous photograph of a grinning Lee Harvey Oswald holding his rifle. The picture's authenticity has been widely questioned most recently in "J.F.K." The shadows cast by his face and body don't match prompting charges that Oswald's head was superimposed on someone else's body.
 9,Harris County Tex. and the Port of Houston Authority situated in that county are revamping their finances with a new $618 million bond issue that will be used to refund all their previously issued bonds.Tentative interest rates on the new bonds were announced yesterday by underwriters led by Kidder Peabody & Company. For unlimited tax bonds yields ranged from 5.60 percent for bonds due in 1986 to 7.40 percent in 1990 8.60 percent in 1995 9.20 percent in 2000 and 9.50 percent in 2006. Yields were higher by one-tenth of a percentage point for a companion issue of limited tax bonds.Although all the bonds are rated triple A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation the financing is divided into limited and unlimited tax bonds. The unlimited tax bonds are backed by the ability of the county and the port authority to levy property taxes without limit while the limited tax bonds are backed by the county's ability to levy a property tax up to 30 cents per $100 of market value. The limited tax bonds have a higher yield because in theory they are less secure than the unlimited tax bonds.Despite the difference between the two kinds of bonds the limited tax issue was assigned the highest triple A rating because the county's financial condition is strong and because its tax levy of about 5 1/2 cents per $100 of market value in 1984 was far below the legal limit.

 0,LOS ANGELES — The celebrated musical “La La Land” which begins its theatrical run next week is expected to be a force in multiple Oscar races including for best picture but not least for best actor and best actress. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone so perfectly inhabit their melancholy characters or so the chatter on the fall awards circuit is going that they were born to play the roles.They almost didn’t get them.As the film was coming together in late 2014 Lionsgate the studio behind “La La Land” said that the leads — difficult roles requiring singing dancing and dramatic emotional swings — had gone to Miles Teller then generating buzz for playing a tortured drummer in “Whiplash” and Emma Watson best known as Hermione in the “Harry Potter” movies.“La La Land” directed and written by Damien Chazelle would have been a big deal for both young stars.

 0,Patients who underwent a minimally invasive procedure to reduce their risk of a stroke by clearing plaque from neck arteries had unexpected gains in memory and mental skills according to a study that will be presented today at a medical conference in Toronto.If the results are confirmed by other trials wider use of the procedure may allow many elderly people to continue to live independently said Dr. Rodney Raabe the radiologist who led the research team at the Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane Wash.The procedure is known as carotid stenting and has been recently developed as an alternative to painful neck surgery which about 150000 Americans undergo annually at a cost of some $2 billion. It relies on tiny devices maneuvered through the circulatory system to the carotid arteries in the neck from a small incision in the thigh. Doctors inflate a balloon to push the plaque into the vessel wall and then implant a metal mesh scaffold or stent to keep the artery open.Dr. Raabe's research team had set out hoping to find that stenting reduced stroke risks without damaging mental abilities. While stenting typically improves blood flow to the brain it also unleashes a temporary shower of microdebris that can disrupt brain functions occasionally causing fatal strokes or other serious harm.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe team enrolled 100 patients over the last two years to look at whether using a filter to catch most of the debris during the procedure would reduce the disruptions so patients suffered no mental impairment. Two smaller less rigorous studies had previously suggested that patients might benefit mentally — as have some studies of neck surgery — but Dr. Raabe said he had been skeptical of those reports.The new data are the strongest yet to suggest that the benefits from the increased blood flow tend to swamp any harm from the debris. Taking memory tests and so-called executive function tests that required them to perform a series of actions to complete a task patients did better after the procedure than before. Some reported that colors were brighter. On the basis of the first 30 patients given follow-up tests after six months Dr. Raabe said it was already statistically improbable that the improvements were due to chance.

 0,Just when despair was kicking in the roles came: a loopy spin instructor on “Broad City” an acting student on “Barry” and a lead role as Janet on “The Good Place” in which she plays opposite Kristen Bell and Ted Danson. (Coordinating the shooting schedules for multiple comedies is no joke.)Working on a fizzily optimistic show like “The Good Place” is “healthy for me” Ms. Carden said. “It’s about imperfect people trying to be better.”After finishing her tea Ms. Carden took out her iPhone to show Ms. Perr some of the designs she liked. (The phone had a picture of Timothée Chalamet on the home screen. “I thought I’d do Chalamet across my chest” she joked.)“This one spoke to my brain the most” she said pointing to a cent symbol haloed by diamonds though Ms. Carden wanted a topper of three dots instead to represent “Me Jason and Penny” she said.Ms. Perr uploaded the design to her computer tweaked it and then sent it to a printer. In the meantime she had Ms. Carden sign a liability waiver. “Are you trying to scare me?” Ms. Carden said.With the stencil in hand the two women stood in front of a full-length mirror to figure out where the tattoo should go. They quickly decided on the area beneath Ms. Carden’s right wrist bone which would be a slight hassle for the makeup artists on “The Good Place” but until Janet gets a tattoo upgrade that’s that.

 0,TELEVISION in the next century will surely be about choice. No matter what form the television set itself takes the number of programs it delivers will be virtually limitless with the notion of separate distinct channels all but extinct. Instead every home will have the ME channel -- really a series of channels one for each member of the family offering a completely individualized lineup of programs assembled from the all-but-infinite selections pulsing through the digital web.Thus television the most effective mass medium ever devised will be undermined as a vehicle of mass distribution -- and with it will go the hit show. Why? Because the same digital forces will also affect magazines newspapers and radio causing them to narrow their focus -- and making it almost impossible for producers to establish a new show among a wide variety of viewers at the same time. There will be no reason to broadcast a show at a given hour (except for live events like sports) so the possibilities for creating a nationally popular entertainment program will be drastically limited.With few bona fide hits advertising revenues will most likely shrink. That will mean a switch to an almost entirely pay-per-view system for the ME channels just like at a movie theater.Programmers will try to counter with interactive communications made possible by the merging of the television and the computer to create instant word of mouth about new shows.

 0,“The room was close and sweaty suffocatingly so. It had been a hot and surly summer in Manhattan and summer in the city is more than anything a psychological season a season dictated by income bracket. (The lower your bracket the longer and hotter and smellier summer is.)”Betsy Berne from her wonderful novel “Bad Timing”“I don’t own a house in the country. For a lot of the time I couldn’t afford it and when I could afford it I didn’t have the urge. I think that almost everyone now owns a house in the country so there is a guest shortage and I feel I fill that need.”Something Fran Lebowitz once said.* * *At the exact moment at which I agreed to do this column I was stung by a bee. I was in the country walking hastily away from a swimming pool so as not to bother people with a cell phone conversation. “Fine” I said in response to the editor who was apologizing because they could not pay me what had been asked. Then all of a sudden I started hobbling from this pain in my toe. A moment later I was sitting on the grass like a monkey — my foot in both hands bringing it toward my face. With my head cocked so as to cradle the phone while I pulled out the tiny glistening stinger I said “I’ll do it.”This was before the war started. To say the war is factually and possibly morally wrong. But that is the word that sprang to mind. The ambivalences multiply as fast as the unlikely sentiments. I mention the bee sting because the timing seemed interesting — can you write about August in New York at such a moment without somehow shooting yourself (getting a stinger) in the foot?* * *Our hosts for our prewar country sojourn live in Saratoga Springs N.Y. full time. They used to live in Manhattan. Over dinner our first night we discussed a move to Roanoke Va. that my wife and I are going to make this fall. I’ve taken a job for a year a visiting professor gig at Hollins University.“You’ll find that living outside of New York is very convenient; there are a lot of things that will just be easier for you” our host said. “You may like it.” He dabbed a napkin to his lips. “Then there are things you will miss.”These comments were bracing though I can not say if it was the first half or the second half that moved me with worry — that we might like living elsewhere or that there are things that we will miss.* * *Back from the country I arrived into a heat wave. The city was like a kiln but I had been in the country long enough to have started to crave the city and my enthusiasm for it survived the first scorching day intact.On the second day I was standing in the subway listening to my iPod Shuffle with my face in the paper. Suddenly someone bumped into me from behind. He really jostled me. I hardly had time to react before he was past me though at the last second I did something with my body barely a twitch. It was a late rebuttal of sorts to the rude shove.The man slid past me and then turned to face me at the distance of a foot or so. He was slender and had high cheekbones a baseball cap on backward with a bandana underneath baggy jeans and though I couldn’t register this at the time the coloring of both an Asian and a Hispanic man. Like me he had white earplugs in his head. Our eyes met for a beat. Then he said loudly “If you didn’t have those earplugs in your head you would have heard me say’Excuse me.’ Dumb ass!” Impressively he stood right there and stared.I responded with a witheringly blank look or depending on how you consider it a look that reflected a certain dullness and inability to think on your feet compounded by the fact that I was on my way home from the dentist and half my face was numb. So I stared at him with an expression that said I am bigger than you but incapable of speech and possibly thought. I stared right into his eyes. There was a small horizontal scar above his left cheekbone. He was a cool-looking dude. We faced off like boxers before a fight.This was high theater and everyone in our vicinity was looking at us. But I could offer nothing to keep the play going. After a moment he stormed halfway up the car and I stared at him for minute in an attempt to recoup dignity and tried to formulate what I should have said.There is a term for thinking of the snappy thing to say after the fact. It is French. l’esprit de l’escalier the spirit of the staircase. This was l’esprit de l’subway.The big ideas that came to me while I pretended to go back to reading my paper were: “Are you also an ass in winter?” and “What are those white things sticking in your ears?” But only now writing this down do I wish I had simply said “I am sorry I blocked your way; please accept my apology.” That would have been amazing. But I am not that cool or that swift. Maybe next time.

 9,Mr. Gilroy said yesterday that when he created Amos Burke in 1963 he sold only the television rights for the use of the character and retained publishing rights for himself.He said he thought then that Burke might be his hero in of the character and retained publishing rights for himself.He said he thought then that Burke Might be his hero in a series of detective novels. However he added “the opportunity to publish a series of books was ruined by those companies when they proceeded with the publication of two paperback books in 1964 using the character and written by another author.”Mr. Gilroy filed suit in April 1965 following the publication of those two books. The suit finally came into Manhattan State Supreme Court in 1972 before Justice Sidney A. Fine. The case ended with a verdict in Mr. Gilroy's favor. Justice Fine found that the defendants had misappropriated the character. Mr. Gilroy was awarded about $15000 the profits from publication of the books as compensation. He refused to and heMr. Gilroy said that it was critical to him to prove to the court that Burke would have been of much greater value had the paperbacks not been written..

 0,To the Editor:In his review of Michael A. Bellesiles's ''Arming America'' (Sept. 10) Garry Wills accepts the book's ludicrous argument which dismisses the use of firearms in America from early times.At first guns were indeed rare and unreliable. The need however was undeniable. You can't kill a deer with a sharp stick and it's all but impossible to bring down a rabbit with a thrown stone. The early muskets were improved but not soon. The ''embattled farmers'' who fired ''the shot heard round the world'' were underequipped but they sure were better shots than the Brits. It took them seven years underfed frostbitten and underarmed but in the end they defeated the finest army in the world. They didn't do it with pocket knives.As for those wise old dead white guys who invented our country it may well be that the creation of the United States was the most important event since the founding of the Roman Republic. If you accept this as I assume most Americans would then follow the trail of revolution: the next was the French Revolution dissolving almost at once into the bloody Terror succeeded in turn by the dictatorship of Napoleon followed in time by the equally bloody dictatorships of Stalin Mussolini Hitler (the last two elected democratically) Mao Zedong Fidel Castro Pol Pot and Laurent Kabila. The first act of each of these bloody-handed tyrants on taking power was to confiscate all privately held firearms. Perhaps that will give Wills pause.He is correct in saying that the Civil War brought immense improvement in the design and quality of guns (from cannons to pistols). The Confederates tended to be better shots but the Union troops improved throughout the war and of course had better weaponry and equipment over all. The Plains Indians were subdued after the war by cavalrymen even better armed than they'd been in the Civil War.

 0,ISTANBUL — Even before he began his first day at work as Istanbul’s new mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was being talked about as the man who could challenge President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the leadership of Turkey in four years’ time.For the moment he is avoiding the question and insists that he will concentrate for the next five years on serving Istanbul a sprawling metropolis of 15 million inhabitants a quarter of whom live below the poverty line.“Right now I am a person who is fully concentrated on governing” he told foreign journalists at a news briefing on his first day in office last Friday. “But if there are those who see our star high in the sky we thank them.”There is no doubt that he presents a broader threat to the president. Mr. Imamoglu said he fully intended to use the enormous popular support that elected him by a surprisingly wide margin in a rerun on June 23 as a mandate to push back against Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarianism and bring democracy and fairness to all of Turkey.

 0,JACKSONVILLE Fla. — Even with one more win Bobby Bowden couldn’t gain ground on Penn State’s Joe Paterno the coach with the most career victories in the Football Bowl Subdivision. At the same time Florida State was beating West Virginia 33-21 in Bowden’s swan song at the Gator Bowl Paterno’s Nittany Lions were holding off L.S.U. 19-17 at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando.Paterno 82 has 394 victories. Bowden 80 ended his 55-year coaching career with 389 but stands to lose as many as 14 of those because of academic misconduct.“I wanted 400 so bad” Bowden said “because I felt like well Joe is going to beat me. When they took away those games Joe is going to beat me. And if I could just get to 400 it would be me and him. I could hang around with him and follow him around a little bit.”Bowden who has coached the past 34 seasons at Florida State was forced to resign at the end of the Seminoles’ 6-6 regular season. He will be replaced by the offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher. Bowden wished to coach one more year so he could reach the 400-win milestone. Despite not being able to go out on his own terms Bowden said he is at peace.“I’m not ate up with coaching football at my life” he said. “I have got 80 years in. I wanted 81 but I got 80 years in. I wanted more and couldn’t have it. They wouldn’t let me have it.”He added: “I have always felt like you can’t take it with you. If I want more games than anybody else which I’m not Joe is so what? When I die I can’t take it with me. There are things in life more important. There are just things more important than that to me. That’s why I’m at peace with myself.”He said he was reminded after the game that victories aren’t everything. In the locker room Bowden’s players asked him to sign their jerseys and he was able to spend a few minutes with former players like Derrick Brooks and Chris Weinke one of two Heisman Trophy winners that Bowden coached.“It is a great closeness there” Bowden said. “It’s is like a family. And I really appreciate all those boys coming back to the game.”

 9,Microelectronic circuits embedded on pieces of silicon are the building blocks of modern electrical devices from computers and communication equipment to consumer electronics goods. They are also critical components of weaponry automobile-engine control systems to improve fuel efficiency and factory automation systems.The performance of these vital components will continue to improve over the next decade rippling through the economy. The number of transistors that can be put on a chip will increase from about one million to close to 100 million. As that happens more and more of the value of a computer will be contained in the chip. Complex chips specialized for particular tasks hold out the best hope of achieving long-sought goals like computers that can understand speech or interpret scenes.The United States still leads in designs of clever circuitry but lags in the ability to manufacture chips. Sematech the consortium financed by the Government and the semiconductor industry is seeking to redress that balance. It is also trying to keep alive the endangered American manufacturers of chip-making equipment.But Sematech alone even if it is successful will not be enough experts say. A big problem for the United States is not technology but capital. Most American companies can no longer afford to build advanced manufacturing plants which cost several hundred million dollars now and promise to keep getting more expensive.

 9,Since World War I Fort Amador has been the jewel of the American military presence here dominating the Pacific Ocean entrance of the Panama Canal. But on Tuesday the 207-acre site which includes the residence of the United States Army commander is to be transferred to Panamanian control.The change is the beginning of a marked acceleration in the pace of the American withdrawal from Panama. Over the next year the United States is also scheduled to hand over Albrook Air Force Station Gorgas Hospital and the Arraijan fuel depot and reduce its strength here from 6800 to 4400 soldiers.In addition by the time the Federal Government's 1997 fiscal year ends next Sept. 30 the headquarters of the United States Southern Command here on Quarry Heights in one form or another since 1916 plans to have left for its new billet in Miami.Among Panamanians that prospect has awakened as much apprehension as pride.With barely three years remaining before the final American departure this country of 2.5 million people finds itself rummaging for ways to put these newly reverting areas to use and gradually realizing that maintenance costs will be huge especially if private investment projects fail to materialize.

 0,But that’s the way the labor market works in general with some sectors expanding at any point in time and others contracting. Right now the retail sector is bleeding jobs as physical stores give way to more online shopping. The information-services sector shed more than a million jobs from 2001 to 2012. The share of jobs in manufacturing has been falling pretty much continuously since World War II.So the real question is not whether some jobs involving fossil fuels will go away if greenhouse gases are regulated more stringently; what matters is whether the jobs that emerge to replace them will pay better or worse.If no jobs emerge at all and unemployment rises then that’s a failure of macroeconomic stabilization — which is to say it’s the Federal Reserve’s fault for keeping interest rates too high.There’s a parallel with trade policy. Major trade deals have minimal effects on the overall number of jobs and increase incomes on average but may have a particularly large job-reducing effects in particular locations and among particular workers.In other words it’s one thing to say that jobs drilling for oil and mining coal will go away even as jobs installing solar panels will be created. That sounds comforting — but if different people in different locations are doing those jobs there can still be disruption.And beyond the complexity of modeling how climate policies will affect the economy and the judgment call of how much value to assign to preserving existing jobs there is an even bigger question.In pessimistic forecasts of the impact of climate change the cost to adapt to a warming planet will be eventually be huge potentially including vast expenditures to try to protect cities from rising seas adjusting agriculture to new climate patterns and countless other changes to business and the economy.

 9,Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin charges that New York City's emergency repair program for rundown housing is riddled with mismanagement and ineptness by city agencies and with excessive charges And poor work by contractors causing a loss of half the $7.5 million spent on the program last year.In an audit of the program completed last week but not yet generally made public Mr. Goldin described the program in terms .similar to those used by Mayor Beame when he was the Comptroller in 1972.At that time during the majoralty of John V. Lindsay the emergency repair program was mired in scandals which included charges of questionable contract arrangements loose procedures and overpayments for work. Steps were subsequently taken that were designed to remove the abuses.The program dating from 1965 seeks to restore essential services and remove dangerous conditions when private landlords fail to do so in their apartment buildings. The city hires contractors to do the jobs and then seeks to recoup the costs from the landlords.

 0,New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in presenting the city’s budget counseled austerity becuse he sees the real estate market slowing and prices dropping. That would mean less tax revenue.“The city’s commercial occupancy rate is the highest in the nation. New York’s real estate market is expected to slow however with a 10% decline in home prices a 14% decline in home sales over the next few years and a significant decline in real estate transaction taxes that have buoyed the City’s tax revenue in the last few fiscal years.”It’s a healthy warning to other localities that are awash in tax money thanks to the housing boom. It isn’t going to last. — DAMON DARLIN

 9,For his part Mr. Brock has not responded publicly to reports of internal bickering over civil rights policy beyond insisting that his views are shared by President Reagan and other Administration officials. In any event the growing brouhaha over affirmative action is not only an indication of how the issue of race still stirs strong emotions but also a sign that Mr. Brock's honeymoon at the department may be over. ''The long knives are out for Brock'' said a senior Labor Department official close to the Secretary ''and there's going to be a continuing struggle as to what he can do here.''It's all a far cry from the heady days just five months ago when Mr. Brock a former Republican senator and onetime chairman of his party's national committee answered President Reagan's appeal and left his position as United States Trade Representative to try to invigorate the demoralized agency. He succeeded Raymond J. Donovan who resigned in March after a New York judge ordered him to stand trial on charges of fraud and larceny and began a whirlwind of policy and personnel changes. Mr. Brock quietly removed several of Mr. Donovan's aides who had had sharp disputes with career employees. At the same time he filled a number of key positions some of which had been vacant for more than a year. The strategy by most accounts produced quick results. Morale improved and he has reopened the department's doors to labor and civil rights groups by adopting what appears to be a more conciliatory attitude about their concerns.Moving to soothe a particularly sore spot among critics of Mr. Donovan's tour in the department Mr. Brock promised to review a decision by Robert A. Rowland the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration not to require farmers to provide toilets drinking water and other sanitary facilities for half a million field hands throughout the country. He also told labor groups that the Administration's proposal for a youth subminimum wage scale was flawed and according to Labor Department officials he intends to announce this fall major modifications in the bill.Lynn R. Williams the president of the United Steel Workers of America said that so far Mr. Brock's tenure is ''a great improvement over where we were before - Certainly it's a much more open department.'' And A.F.L.-C.I.O. president Lane Kirkland long a critic of the Administration's labor policies said he was ''bemused'' by reports that Mr. Brock was being advised to take a tougher line with organized labor. ''There have always been elements of the Reagan Administration that have wanted to do away with the labor movement'' Mr. Kirkland said.But conservative groups in particular are increasingly unhappy about the Labor Department's new leadership which they accuse of being far too interested in improving its image and appeasing critics. Reed Larson head of the National Right to Work Committee a conservative lobbying organization accused Mr. Brock of ''turning his back on the rights of working people while catering to the institutional interests of politically powerful union officials.''

 0,''It doesn't take a leap of imagination to expect that at some point those nations will work with those terrorist networks and assist them in achieving and obtaining those kinds of capabilities'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.Mr. Rumsfeld speaking on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' did not name those terrorist-supporting nations. But a Department of Defense report released in January said that Iraq Iran Syria Sudan and Libya all have active chemical or biological weapons programs. In addition Iraq and Iran are trying to acquire materials for nuclear devices the report said. Those nations all are on the State Department's list of governments thought to sponsor international terrorism.Mr. Rumsfeld is preparing to release the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review an assessment of the nation's defense needs mandated by Congress. The document which will be sent to Congress on Monday focuses heavily on the need to protect the United States against terrorism and ballistic missile attacks and on the proliferation of chemical biological and nuclear weapons.Mr. Rumsfeld said today that the military was in the process of adjusting its command structure to deal with terrorism. ''There's always been terrorism'' he said ''but there's never really been worldwide terrorism at a time when the weapons have been as powerful as they are today with chemical and biological and nuclear weapons spreading to countries that harbor terrorists.''The defense secretary's concerns were repeated by Mr. Card. ''I'm not trying to be an alarmist'' Mr. Card said on ''Fox News Sunday'' ''but we know that these terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda run by Osama bin Laden and others have probably found the means to use biological or chemical warfare.''But for all the concerns that terrorists armed with chemical or biological weapons would have for the general public Pentagon officials say they are most immediately worried about the safety of American military forces.Asked today whether the United States was worried that military conflict in South Asia might destabilize Pakistan which has nuclear weapons Mr. Rumsfeld said yes. And asked if the United States would soon turn its attention to nations other than Afghanistan that support terrorism like Iraq Mr. Rumsfeld replied ''I think we're already turning our attention to other states.''

 9,NEW YORK has always been a tough market for small agencies. To succeed most rely on their creative reputations for producing the innovative work not usually found at many larger agencies.But a few others are coming up with new ways to appear distinctive. Carroll Raj Stagliano for example an agency with billings of only about $12 million is relying on account planning to give it a competitive edge.Account planning is a technique in which an agency researcher acts as the voice of the consumer during the process of creating ads. The technique is widely used by British agencies but one that has never caught on in this country.Most American agencies use conventional research techniques in which information on consumer attitudes about products is simply passed along to the creative department. But account planning differs in several ways.

 9,Edward Carter Ives a former Connecticut real-estate agent died Friday at his home in Kennebunkport Me. He was 81 years old.Mr. Ives a native of Bridgeport Conn. owned and operated Ives & Rogers Real Estate in Greenwich. He had been president of the Greenwich Real Estate Board.He graduated from Yale University in 1929.Surviving are his wife the former Cecelia Gray; a son Eli; a daughter Candee Ives Weed and nine grandchildren.
 0,But he claimed at the time to have no ambitions to lead the orchestra and the board went with an outsider: Mr. Woods who had developed a reputation for innovation during his run as president of the Seattle Symphony. The staff he inherited included at least two people who had been discussed as contenders for his job. When he departed he said in a statement that “after a great deal of reflection I have concluded that my hopes and aspirations lie elsewhere.”In a sign of how awkward the upheaval has been and how quickly the change of leadership was put into place Mr. Smith declined to be interviewed which is rare for the incoming chief executive of a major orchestra. Sophie Jefferies the orchestra’s director of public relations said in an email that Mr. Smith was “not giving interviews at this juncture” and that he “would like time to set his vision for the organization and will talk later.”It was not immediately clear what the appointment would mean for the Ojai Music Festival about 90 minutes north of Los Angeles where Mr. Smith recently began his tenure as artistic director. (His first edition of the festival is planned for June 2020.) Asked if running Ojai so near the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its summer home the Hollywood Bowl was seen as a conflict or complication officials at the orchestra and the festival said that there would be no change at the festival.After Mr. Woods stepped down several prominent critics expressed support for Mr. Smith. In The Los Angeles Times Mark Swed described him as the “obvious” candidate. And several composers including John Adams praised his appointment on social media. “Sometimes” Mr. Adams wrote in a post on Twitter “things actually go right in the world and today that happened in L.A. with Chad Smith being named to run the Philharmonic.”

 0,From Greenwich to East Hampton on private helicopter pools ferrying investment bankers into town from Long Island's South Fork and in the steam room of Park Avenue's Racquet Club the cognoscenti can readily recognize one familiar facet of the tale of Martha Stewart and her friend the now-former biotechnology chief executive Samuel D. Waksal: they were entwined in a Manhattan grapevine where the exchange of corporate information is a burgeoning social custom not necessarily a crime.In Manhattan and its environs friendships like theirs often coincide with business relationships. And where power access and social advantage intersect information that most Americans would think of as exceedingly privileged is passed at cocktail parties and over linen-clad dinner tables as casually as canapés.In the latest case however investigators are asking whether a few social figures went over the line. On June 12 Dr. Waksal then chief executive of ImClone Systems was arrested on charges of insider trading. Ms. Stewart's actions are being examined in several investigations. She and Dr. Waksal say they did nothing illegal or wrong.Insider trading is the buying or selling of securities for personal gain with the knowing use of confidential information. While the whispers of the moneyed crowd are not usually the kind of information that will send its purveyors away in federally issued orange jumpsuits the chattering classes do trade data on the subtle level of plain old sociability.
 0,Although my recipe makes enough for 12 I wouldn't halve it. Simply freeze the six you don't want as soon as they cool and make life easier for yourself another day. Shortcakes really have to be eaten the day they are made (if you are not freezing them) so unless you have a voracious horde coming over it isn't worth splitting and filling the whole batch now. Besides once you make these you're going to have requests for them again. Now you're prepared. So sit back and enjoy the remaining bit of summer while you can.SALMON WITH THYME LEMON BUTTER AND ALMONDS Time: 40 minutes1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 4-pound salmon cleaned and scaled head and tail removed 2 scallions trimmed 1 small bunch (about 1/2 cup) fresh thyme 6 tablespoons melted butter 1 tablespoon sea salt 1/3 cup sliced almonds Juice of half a lemon.1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Lay out a double layer of foil big enough to wrap fish in and drizzle with oil. Place fish on foil. Put scallions and half the thyme in cavity of fish. Drizzle 2 tablespoons butter over fish and sprinkle with salt to taste. Wrap fish loosely place on a baking sheet and bake 35 minutes. 2. Place a small skillet over medium heat. When pan is hot add almonds and stir until golden brown. Remove from pan and set aside. In a small bowl combine remaining melted butter and lemon juice; set aside. 3. When fish is cooked carefully peel skin from side facing you. With a knife divide fish in three portions by making two long cuts parallel to each other and perpendicular to the backbone. Cut down to the rib bones but do not cut through them. Remove a portion of meat by sliding a spatula over rib bones and pulling meat away; repeat with 2 remaining portions and place on three warmed plates. Remove backbone and attached rib bones. Cut three more fillets from remaining fish placing them on plates. 4. Drizzle lemon butter over each fillet and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Pull leaves from remaining sprigs of thyme and scatter over fillets. Serve immediately.Yield: 6 servings.CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY SHORTCAKES Time: 40 minutesFor the shortcakes:Vegetable oil or nonstick spray for pan 1 2/3 cups flour 1/3 cup cocoa 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 2 tablespoons sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) diced chilled butter 1 large egg 1 cup sour cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 tablespoons honeyFor the filling: 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar 1 cup raspberries.1. To prepare shortcakes heat oven to 400 degrees. Oil bottom of each cup in a 12-cup muffin pan. In a mixing bowl combine flour cocoa baking powder baking soda and sugar. Using a pastry blender or an electric mixer or working by hand cut in the butter until mixture resembles damp sand. In a separate bowl whisk together egg sour cream vanilla and honey. Add to flour mixture and stir until thoroughly blended. 2. Put a scant 1/4 cup dough into each muffin cup. (Do not use muffin papers.) Bake until risen and firm on top 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Then remove from pan and cool completely. Place 6 shortcakes in an airtight freezer bag and freeze for another use. 3. To prepare filling for 6 shortcakes whip heavy cream with 2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar until thick but still soft. Add 1/2 cup raspberries to cream mashing them roughly with a fork. 4. Split each shortcake in half horizontally and place a dollop of raspberry cream onto bottom half. Add a portion of whole raspberries and put the top back on at an angle. Sprinkle a dusting of the remaining 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar over shortcakes and serve.Yield: 12 shortcakes and filling for 6.

 0,WASHINGTON — The State Department inspector general has determined that Huma Abedin the close confidant of Hillary Rodham Clinton must return more than $9000 for alleged overpayments made to her during her time working for the department when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state according to her lawyer and Senate documents.The inquiry into Ms. Abedin a longtime aide to Mrs. Clinton and wife of Anthony Weiner the former New York congressman comes at a time of increased congressional scrutiny into the tenure of the former secretary of state as she seeks the Democratic nomination for president.The inspector general directed Ms. Abedin to refund the government $9857.73 according to a letter released Saturday by her lawyer Karen L. Dunn who said Ms. Abedin will challenge the finding. Her lawyers criticized the inquiry for “holes in its methodology” and “unsupported allegations.”The investigation which was first reported in Saturday editions of The Washington Post was brought to the attention of the office of the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Charles E. Grassley Republican of Iowa a spokesperson for the senator said. The senator has not yet obtained a copy of the inspector general’s investigation which has not been made public.Letters from the judiciary committee dated July 30 raised concerns that Ms. Abedin had been improperly paid twice for work done while she was on leave or working for the Clinton Foundation. Ms. Abedin has requested an administrative review at the State Department.Specifically Ms. Abedin is said to have taken a vacation and maternity leave that she did not officially file for. But her representatives say that she was still working during those times.“Huma has been nothing but cooperative in helping the department work through its record-keeping issues and she will continue to do so in the hope the right thing is done” said Ms. Dunn.Senator Grassley’s office denied there was any political motivation for the committee’s interest in the matter.“Information about the State Department’s practices on special government employees email use and more has been hard to come by” Senator Grassley said in an emailed statement. “As information came in it evolved to focus on an agency that used the designation in a different way than others in at least one high-profile case.”John Kirby the State Department spokesman said in an email “We are in receipt of Senator Grassley’s letter and will respond to it accordingly.”

 9,Gertrud Michelson's ''When a Child Walks Away'' [Opinion Page June 10] evoked a sad nostalgia as I recalled a similar experience not many years after the author's.I was a little older than Gertrud back in the 40's when I ''ran away'' - about 11 years of age. And my trip took me much farther - from Philadelphia to New York.My mother was visiting her mother in New York and I became angry at my father who was home with my brother and me. I raided my bank (public transportation was very reasonable in those days!) and set off by trolley car (a natural means of transportation for an 11-year-old then) for Pennsylvania Station in Philadelphia. In looking back I wonder why I was not questioned at the ticket window; I purchased my ticket and made the trip uneventfully to New York.From there it was just a non-threatening subway ride to 96th and Central Park West and a three-block walk to my grandmother's house - where I was welcomed by a near-hysterical mother and grandmother because my father had called frantically to report my disappearance.

 0,To the Editor:Re “Can Joe Biden Be Forgiven?” by Lucy Flores (Op-Ed April 30):I believe that the reason Mr. Biden is not doing a satisfying apology to either Anita Hill or Ms. Flores (and anyone else he was too physical with) is that he is still hoping to appeal to President Trump’s male voters and he doesn’t want his apology to be campaign fodder for Mr. Trump however well meaning it may be.The problem for Mr. Biden is that he may be overestimating what an apology means to men at the expense of underestimating its meaning to women.Gayle Pickard-FishmanEnglewood N.J.To the Editor:Studies have revealed that those who refuse to apologize after hurting others feel more powerful as a result. Conversely those who do apologize feel less powerful even as they stand to benefit by repairing a fractured relationship.As disappointing as it may be it should come as no surprise that both our president and those vying for his position seem oddly allergic to those two little words: I’m sorry.

 9,On bad days I wear red. What's a bad day? It's one when words won't come; when the typewriter is glum and unproductive; when I've burned the prunes for the second time; when the crevices in my skin make me sad - again.So I wear red - brilliant with life a spirit-lifter. Also it gives spring a giant prod. I don't demean winter; it has its scenic brittle splendor albeit with melancholy attributes. I don't gainsay that my neighbor's oak tree with outstretched branches doesn't have a bleak appeal but what compares with the magenta peach and blue crocuses and those daring darling daffodils and a soft breeze like a blessing?Suddenly the universe bursts into being. So it is with color - twin playmate to hope - even reflected in the new fashions: flamboyant dresses with riotous configurations on skirts scarfs footgear. Black has no status in this landscape; gray rates poorly.In this atmosphere corns ache less bones cease some of their grinding eyes are alerted jitters ease off and spirits soar. Red is a singing color an antidote to winter's impudence. Something positive and gutsy in red is a fillip to ego and spirit.
 9,BOSTON June 30 (AP) —Rocky Colavito drove in two runs with a home run and double and three Kansas City pitchers combined to hurl a two‐hitter as the Athletics defeated the Boston Red Sox 2—1 today.Two right‐handers Moe Drabowsky and Wes Stock held the Red Sox to one hit until the ninth when Carl Yastrzemski spoiled the A's shutout bid with a home run off StocK. John Wyatt then went in and preserved Drabowsky's third victory by getting the last two Red Sox hitters.
 0,The results are based on interviews with 1660 voters entering 40 randomly selected Democratic caucus sites. Samples are subject to a potential sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Results based on smaller subgroups like supporters of a particular candidate have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on caucus day such as some voters changing their mind after they enter the caucus may introduce other sources of error into the poll.The Iowa caucus poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters on Monday evening as they entered party caucus sites throughout the state. The poll was conducted by Edison Research of Somerville N.J. for the National Election Pool a consortium of ABC News The Associated Press CBS News CNN Fox News and NBC News.The Times was assisted in its polling analysis by Prof. David R.

He was elected secretary of the union in 1962 secretary treasurer in 1972.He was a vice president of the international union and vice chairman of the New York State Service Employes Legislative Committee.He leaves his wife the former Muriel Foy; two daughters Carol and Mrs. Theresa Pusateri and a brother Chester.
 9,New-media concepts still baffle many of the 17000 who attended Natpe. Many think digital television means high-definition television and dismiss it as a gimmick. Others understand that digital TV simply means a digitally compressed signal that can carry voluminous amounts of extra information with the traditional sound and picture -- but even those people have no clue what extra information their viewers will want.And so the computer mavens -- distinguishable by the sporty polo shirts they wore instead of jackets and ties -- swooped in preaching the gospel of digital bits and video streaming. Steve Klein director of new-business development for Intervu Inc. a company that helps people expand the reach and speed of their Web sites said Internet knowledge among television executives was rising.''Two years ago it would have been 'Streaming -- what?' '' he said. ''Last year it was 'Streaming -- how?' And this year it's 'Streaming -- when?' Can you do it live? Can you do video on demand?''Last year three panels during the four-day convention addressed new-media issues. This year 11 did out of 31 altogether. Last year a seminar on how to sell ads on a Web site drew 10 people who sat around a table together; this year it attracted almost 100 and aides had to drag more chairs into the room.Molly Glover the director of interactive marketing at the Granite Broadcasting Corporation which owns 10 television stations helped conduct that seminar.All 10 Granite stations have Web sites and 3 -- in San Jose Calif. Buffalo and Austin Tex. -- are ''streaming'' their news broadcasts now: This means people with personal computers no matter where they are can watch the station's local news live or tune in to catch the traffic report. They do so through Mr. Cuban's company Broadcast.com which announced during Natpe that it had just signed contracts with two ABC stations -- WABC Channel 7 in New York and WPVI in Philadelphia -- to stream their news.''We've had quite a few E-mails from servicemen or other people overseas who have watched their local news'' Ms. Glover said. ''And snowbirds in Florida like to watch the Buffalo weather.''

 0,The other side of the ledger could be off as well. For example the $707 billion figure for universal child care factors in economic growth generated by the plan but under “static” scoring — without assuming any changes in growth — the cost is closer to $1.1 trillion. Similarly the $470 billion estimate for free college tuition assumes that states would be willing to contribute the remaining one-third that the federal government does not fund.What Ms. Warren Said“My 2-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the fortunes in this country if we use just a piece of that money to forgive student loan debt for about 95 percent of those who have student loan debt that has huge support among Democrats independents and Republicans.”— Fairfax Va. in MayTrue.Several polls have found that Ms. Warren’s wealth tax plan has broad support though “huge” is a slight overstatement.Of the respondents 61 percent supported the proposal in a January survey commissioned by Data for Progress a left-leaning think tank. More Republicans supported the wealth tax than opposed it 44 percent to 37 percent while 61 percent of independents and 76 percent of Democrats also endorsed it.In a Morning Consult/Politico poll in February 61 percent of all respondents were in favor of the wealth tax including 74 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans.Polling that month from Survey Monkey for The New York Times produced similar results: 61 percent approval among all respondents 75 percent among Democrats 57 percent among independents and 51 percent among Republicans.An April poll from Quinnipiac University found similar or higher levels of support among all respondents (60 percent) Democrats (82 percent) and independents (63 percent) but notably lower approval from Republicans (32 percent in support and 60 percent in opposition).Past stance on potWhat Ms. Warren Said“So actually I supported Massachusetts changing its laws on marijuana. Massachusetts had decriminalized at that point and I thought it made a lot more sense for Massachusetts to go ahead and legalize marijuana and I now support the legalization of marijuana.”— CNN town-hall-style meeting in AprilThis is exaggerated.When a student asked about her evolving position on marijuana legalization Ms. Warren overstated her past support.
 0,“We worship an awesome God in the blue states” Senator Barack Obama said in his star-making speech at the 2004 Democratic convention. Democrats would go on to do some major soul searching about why people who called themselves “values voters” were voting for Republicans. The party has looked for ways to close the “God Gap” and some view Mr. Obama as a Democrat who just might have the whole “God talk” thing down.That didn’t stop some major conservative Christian leaders from objecting to Mr. Obama’s scheduled appearance at an AIDS summit at Saddleback Church a California megachurch run by Pastor Rick Warren author of “The Purpose-Driven Life.” Phyllis Schlafly the head of the Eagle Forum led 17 other conservative leaders in a letter urging Mr. Warren to rescind the invitation due to Mr. Obama’s support of legalized abortion:You cannot fight one evil while justifying another. The evangelical church can provide no genuine help for those who suffer from AIDS if those involved do not first have their ethic of life firmly rooted in the Word of God.Mr. Warren defended his decision and stuck to it:This summit will put people together who normally won’t even speak to each other. But if you can only work with folks you completely agree with you’ve ruled out most of the world.So Mr. Obama appeared earlier today and despite the furor building up to his appearance he didn’t hesitate to make comments that might alienate his hosts:Like no other illness AIDS tests our ability to put ourselves in somebody else’s shoes to empathize with the plight of our fellow man to live up to the Golden Rule. While most would agree that the AIDS orphan or the transfusion victim or the wronged wife contracting the disease through no fault of their own needs help sometimes it’s been easy for us to distance ourselves from those who we think are somehow at fault — the promiscuous youth or the unfaithful husband or the gay man — and say ‘This is your fault you’ve sinned. We have nothing to do with you.’ And I don’t think that’s a satisfactory response. My faith reminds me that we are all sinners. My faith reminds me that there are times where I have fallen and made mistakes. My faith tells me as Pastor Rick has said that it’s not a sin to be sick. My Bible tells me that when God sent His only son to Earth it was to heal the sick and comfort the weary and feed the hungry and clothe the naked to befriend the outcast and redeem those who had strayed from righteousness.And in the something-for-everyone style the junior senator from Illinois is becoming famous for he even had a little bit of political grist for Republicans in the audience:Now let me say this: I want to publicly applaud the Bush administration — I don’t do that that often. And sometimes unfairly so. Because this is an area where I think the Bush administration has not gotten enough credit. The administration and this Congress have been serious about putting resources in contributing to the fight against HIV and AIDS.Tonight Mr. Obama moves on to a more secular stage when he’ll appear on the Jay Leno show. Let’s hope he has the audacity to best one of Mr. Leno’s jokes.
 9,WESTBURY L. I. — Steve Warrington a 24 — year — old trainer hitched up one eighth of his harness‐horse stable at Liberty Bell in Philadelphia one morning a couple of weeks ago and headed for Roosevelt Raceway here with a 3‐year‐old pacer in his van and as he put it “dollar signs in my eyes.”Horses carrying the hopes of small stables from Caribou Me. to New Zealand were leaving the hinterlands of harness racing; Warrington whose father Walter had never quite made it under the bright lights of Roosevelt and Yonkers Raceways was hoping that his Mark Forrester would be that which racer dreams are made of.They wouldn't let Warrington and his horse on the New Jersey Turnpike.A 2½‐hour trip became a four‐hour excursion through the back roads of New Jersey. “I'd never seen such places I went.” said Warrington but he'll make the trip again tomorrow as he has for each race his colt has entered.This time though hopes of victory have increased the dollars signs have diminished.Eight horses all of whom earned less than $5000 through last Dec. 15 as 2‐year‐olds will be racing for a $25000 purse tomorrow night at Roosevelt the biggest prize in their young lives. Mark Forrester qualified for this race the Westbury final of the aptly named Hopeful Series part two of which will start next week at Yonkers Raceway.

 0,At one point this season the Madison Square Garden fans were busy chanting for the team to re-sign forward Sean Avery. But now with Avery out for the season with a lacerated spleen and the Rangers’ playoff lives seemingly resting on the shoulders of captain Jaromir Jagr and goalie Henrik Lundqvist the free agent the Garden fans are showering with attention is Jagr.He was greeted in warmups with signs saying “Come Back J.J.” and fans chanted his name throughout the game. While Jagr brushed off all talk of his future after the game even his teammates admitted it meant something.“I think it means a lot” said center Brandon Dubinsky. “It’s a good feeling when you have your home crowd behind you and they let you know how much they appreciate you. It was nice to hear our fans acknowledge him and what he’s contributed and what he’s continuing to contribute. I think it feels good for him and feels good for the rest of us too.”Jagr scored the biggest goal of the season in the second period the first goal of the game and the one that spelled the end for Pittsburgh in this game. Adding to its drama Jagr was knocked nearly cold by the shoulder of Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik just after he scored. He lay on the ice for awhile but eventually was helped up and skated to the bench. He did not miss a shift.“It was great” said center Scott Gomez. “He’s definitely taken his game to another level. Every time he touched the puck he was a threat. It’s great when your captain’s going like that. He’s been playing like that for a long time. You can tell we definitely fed off him.”Jagr though rightfully shared star billing with Lundqvist who had a spectacular game. He stopped two breakaways by Penguins star Evgeni Malkin and that is not even counting the penalty shot Malkin was awarded after a small shove from Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi. The penalty shot may have been one of the easier saves Lundqvist made because Malkin skated in so slowly and waited so long he had almost no options by the time he took his shot. Lundqvist knocked it away with his glove.It was Lundqvist’s second penalty-shot save of the playoffs (the first came against New Jersey’s John Madden) but this was his first shutout of the playoffs. It came at the perfect time for the Rangers who needed perfection to stave off elimination.As for Avery he remains in intensive care at St. Vincent’s Hospital but the Rangers said he was improving.

 0,ALBANY — It was not even 11 a.m. but the day already looked lost for Gartrell Johnson.On Sunday the first day of Giants training camp Johnson was struggling to complete a conditioning test.Johnson a second-year running back eventually did finish bringing up the rear but that was the closest thing to an incident as the Giants kicked off their season.“Rigor mortis” Coach Tom Coughlin said of Johnson’s struggles.Otherwise Coughlin said it was a great way to open camp. There were no injuries and none of the players were overweight.“We have an entire team where no one is overweight” Coughlin said. “All the big guys. I can’t remember being with a team where all the big guys made it. They all made it.”On the injury front Ahmad Bradshaw (feet and ankle) and Keith Bulluck (knee) did not participate in the conditioning test in the morning but practiced in the evening.Kenny Phillips (knee) and Kevin Boothe (pectoral) were on the physically unable to perform list.But perhaps the Giants will be adding another player to the list: Johnson (rigor mortis).
 9,NAIROBI Kenya May 31—Kenya's Minister for Tourism and Wildlife said today that the Government would follow up its ban on big‐game hunting with a program to crack down on poachers whose activities are a major cause of the dwindling of the country's wildlife.While conceding that legal hunting accounted for the deaths of only 6000 animals last year the minister Matthew J. Ogutu said the ban would enable game wardens to spot poachers more easily since killing of any kind would now be outlawed.In the past he noted hunters and poachers used the same kind of weapons and operated in the same areas and so it was difficult to distinguish between them. “Now anyone found killing breaking the law” he said. “The Government has the long arm to stamp out the poachers.”The minister said that $2.9 million would be spent on helicopters LandRovers and radios to step up his department's antipoaching patrols. The World Bank is supplying the money.

 9,Just as there is a thread that joins the new school designers in Paris so there has blossomed a common spirit among the younger generation of designers in New York which sets them apart from America's old guard.Even if one did not know Cynthia Rowley Susan Lazar Jill Stuart or Donna Haag one could likely correctly guess their age group: in their 30's. There is a giddy informality in their design that one would not expect to find in the work of say a Bill Blass Donna Karan or Ralph Lauren who have come to stand for sober immortal clothes.For many younger designers now clothes seem alive for the moment vibrating with disposable chic. It is an air that both Ms. Lazar and Ms. Stuart expressed well for spring. Ms. Rowley while inhabiting the same universe was not as successful.Her design locomotive was out of control with no clearly discernible direction evident amid her wide-legged trouser suits long awning-stripe dresses ruffled asymmetrical dresses and coat jackets over slim pants.
 9,Nancy McCarthy a former WPIX news writer yesterday depicted Fred M. Thrower president of WPIX as inti mately involved with the pres entation of news on his station calling during and after news casts to complain or make sug gestions.Her characterization of the station executive was at vari ance with large segments of Mr. Thrower's testimony earli er in the WPIX license hearing. Mr. Thrower under question ing by the Federal Communi cations Commission's lawyer Pat W. Valicenti had por trayed himself as leaving day to‐day operations to others. He testified that there were long stretches when he didn't watch WPIX's news.Mrs. McCarthy's testimo ny Which came on her third and final day on the witness stand was capped by her pic ture of Mr. Thrower's concern and by a recital of what she considered misrepresentations of news by WPIX.Under cross‐examination by WPIX's counsel John R. Schoe mer Jr. last Friday Mrs. Mc Carthy admitted that when she complained of news distortions to Mr. Thrower at a confer ence in his office on Dec. 5 1968 she had in one instance exaggerated. Yesterday Mr. Va licenti on re‐direct examina tion attempted to rehabilitate Mrs. McCarthy's testimony.
 9,Puccini's 'Manon Lescaut' A Royal Opera production filmed at Covent Garden featuring Kiri Te Kanawa Placido Domingo and Thomas Allen; conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli Thorn EMI Video 130 minutes. $79.95 ''Manon Lescaut'' may not be everybody's cup of operatic tea but those devoted to it should find this video cassette a special treat.Here is an ardent 18th-century love story that involves a riches-to-rags progression - and all the scenic variety entailed - before the hapless pair die together on a desert island near New Orleans.Implausible? Yes but oh so appealing as acted and sung by Miss Te Kanawa and Mr. Domingo both of whom are slim enough and young enough to be attractive even in close-ups. The seeming ease and naturalness of their singing gives the performance special believability. Other positive factors include Mr. Allen's portrayal of Lescaut Manon's scheming brother and Mr. Sinopoli's splendid conducting.The Gotz Friedrich production was conceived for the Hamburg Opera and borrowed for use at Covent Garden (this version was filmed there in 1983). There are no scenic or directorial surprises in it but Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's set for Act II - the rich part - is notably lavish in a nouveau-riche way.
 9,Angel Cordero Jr. rode Over All to her third straight stakes victory on closing day at Saratoga Race Track today but the 44-year-old rider still fell four victories short of winning his 12th consecutive riding title here.Cordero ended the 24-day Saratoga meeting with 22 victories but Jose Santos the brilliant 26-year-old Chilean jockey who led the nation in earnings last year won 26 races to break Cordero's 11-year hold on the Saratoga title.''If I had to lose I'm glad it was to Jose'' Cordero said today. ''They call him the next Cordero and he deserved it this month. I'll get him next year.''Over All a D. Wayne Lukas-trained daughter of Mr. Prospector became the first filly since Talking Picture in 1972 to sweep Saratoga's stakes series for 2-year-old fillies. She won the opening-day Schuylerville Aug. 5 the Adirondack Aug. 20 and scored by 4 1/4 lengths in the $168900 Spinaway today. Sent off the 3-to-10 favorite in a field of four she ran the six furlongs in 1:11 for her fifth victory in seven career starts. Bold Lady Anne finished second followed by Flashy Runner and Justsayno.
 9,The New York Stock Exchange plans to re-examine its rules for coordinated halts in trading in the market known as circuit breakers John J. Phelan Jr. its chairman said yesterday.The exchange board meets tomorrow when it is expected to announce a series of rule revisions to deal with market volatility. ''We have to revisit the circuit breaker to see if we have adequate ones'' Mr. Phelan said yesterday adding that the re-examination is likely to focus on cross-market circuit breakers which would affect the futures markets in Chicago and the Big Board.''We will probably come out with some short-term things that will speak to the concerns that people have'' Mr. Phelan said of the Thursday meeting. There has been a rising tide of complaints about index arbitrage a form of program trading that is based on differing prices in the stock market and the stock index futures market. But Mr. Phelan declined to be more specific about what changes might be adopted.The exchange has been holding a series of meetings with major participants in the markets in recent days. Yesterday officials met with executives at the top trading desks of Wall Street's largest firms.
 9,State Senate majority leader Ralph J. Marino two months ago came to Washington for a fund-raiser at the Capitol Hill Club. He went back to Albany with between $50000 and $80000 State Senator Guy J. Velella said in a telephone interview. Mr. Velella is the chairman of the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee.If anything the amount donated last year was smaller than the year before when the battle for control of the Senate was coming to a head. In the weeks leading up to the election Federal records show Representative James H. Scheuer a veteran Douglaston Democrat donated $18500 to the state Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. Representative Gary L. Ackerman another Queens Democrat loaned the committee $15000.But the declared donations were only the tip of Washington's financial iceberg. Many representatives convinced friends and contributors to arrange fund-raisers members of the Congressional delegation said. Representative Stephen J. Solarz a Brooklyn Democrat said he helped raise $30000 for the State Senate Democratic Committee. Since he had not given the money himself he was not required to report it. While the Legislature appeared to protect Mr. Solarz's district the plan created by the court could force him to run against another incumbent.The flood of donations spurred by redistricting provides an unusual glimpse into one of the lesser known paths used to channel contributions and underlines how money and access to money has usurped many of the political parties' functions. Traditionally most Federal lawmakers came to Washington after spending years climbing the party structure giving them a broad base of support in the statehouse.But the parties' declining influence has cut many of those ties. And a decade of domestic budget cuts has reduced the number of opportunities for Federal lawmakers to make themselves appear irreplaceable by grabbing slices of the Federal bacon. This has forced representatives to come up with new ways of winning statehouse friends and influence. Role ReversalThe result has been an inversion in members' traditional roles especially in states losing Congressional seats like New York which must cut three districts. Where representatives are accustomed to lobbyists courting them with perks and contributions the redistricting process has turned members into supplicants.The impact of their donations remains unclear. Mr. Solarz and several other members from both sides of the aisle said they have concluded the money was not a wise investment since Democrats failed to gain a Senate majority and legislative deadlock for the moment has put redistricting before the courts. "We now have state judges Federal judges deciding. I hope they don't ask for contributions" Representative Fish joked.
 9,A Federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction today halting the program that pays dairy operators to slaughter their cattle. It also orders the Department of Agriculture to limit the number of animals sent to market.The action grew out of a lawsuit filed in April by beef cattle producers' associations and individual producers from Texas and Montana.The suit said the program designed to reduce dairy herds and cut surplus milk production had cost the cattle industry $25 million in lost revenue in the first week of April and cut the value of cattle on inventory by $2 billion.In addition to issuing the preliminary injunction the judge Halbert O. Woodward ordered that the Department of Agriculture immediately prepare regulations to specify marketing procedures to limit the total dairy cattle marked for slaughter to no more than 7 percent of the national dairy herd each year.

 9,Financial fire fighting and economic coordination are supposed to be specialties of the Group of Seven as the consortium of the world's biggest industrial nations calls itself. But on both counts the recent record of these nations -- the United States France Britain Germany Italy Canada and Japan -- is looking less than impressive.Indeed some economists believe that its impact is in the process of being eclipsed by a lesser-known body of industrialized and developing nations which scored an economic success last week as the Group of Seven produced another disappointment.At their annual spring session in Washington last week finance ministers of the Group of Seven's member nations fell out over the Clinton Administration's indifference toward a weak dollar with many complaining that turbulent currency markets are endangering world recovery.Helmut Kohl the Chancellor of Germany had set the tone before the talks even started by saying American policy was "not acceptable." Lawrence H. Summers an Under Secretary of the Treasury hit back in an interview published with the Handlesblatt newspaper just after the talks by accusing the Germans of "always saying no." Lamberto Dini Italy's Prime Minister and Finance Minister termed the meeting "tense."

 9,The study did not look at the incidence of diseases associated with obesity like diabetes high blood pressure and high levels of blood cholesterol. About 6 percent to 8 percent of obese people develop diabetes said Dr. Jules Hirsch an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University adding that ''diabetes heads the list'' of diseases associated with being fat.The lead author of the study Dr. June Stevens an epidemiologist and nutritionist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill said that she and her colleagues analyzed data collected by the American Cancer Society for a study of cancer prevention.The investigators excluded people who had ever smoked and people who were ill or who had had a recent unexplained weight loss. But that still left more than 300000 people who had been followed from 1960 to 1972.In analyzing the data Dr. Stevens and her colleagues considered body mass index as a measure of fatness. Body mass is defined as 4.89 times the weight in pounds divided by the height in feet squared.The ideal body mass is usually said to be 21. For a woman who is 5 foot 5 that corresponds to a weight of about 126 pounds. Every 6 pounds of weight gained would increase her body mass index by 1 point.A man who is 5 foot 10 and had a body mass index of 21 would weigh 146 pounds. Every 7 pounds he gained would increase his body mass index by 1 point. (To calculate how many pounds equal one point in your body mass index take your height in feet square it and multiply it by 0.204.) But the data show even among the youngest people in the study those ages 30 to 44 among whom the effects of obesity were most profound there were no excess deaths associated with obesity until the body mass index was above 27 and even then the effects were relatively modest -- less than a 25 percent to 50 percent excess death rate -- until the body mass index was about 32 when the risk of death approximately doubles for those ages 30 to 54.Dr. Stevens said that she found the increase in death rates caused by obesity at younger ages to be alarming. And even though there is no good treatment or even a proven prevention that does not mean that people should be complacent she said.''Obesity is an extremely important public health problem'' Dr. Stevens said. And she added with one third of Americans overweight defined as body mass indexes above 27 ''Americans are getting so fat that it's incredible.''

 0,Thank you for your column on traveling with pets (March 4). But please expose the pet travel racket within Europe. We are seeking quotes for taking our Labrador from London to Nice in July or August. British Airways directs us to World Cargo (www.baworldcargo.com) which cites an oligopoly of four accredited shippers.The “handling fee” for pickup and drop-off of the dog works out to £650 with V.A.T. or $1262 at $1.98 to £1 — more than £16 or $31 per kilogram (including crate) — about twice the price of a round-trip business-class ticket. Last year we paid only about £400 ($777) with British Midland which took the dog as “excess baggage.” Are there other options?Claus Moehlmann LondonIt is costly to transport pets if you want them to be safe and comfortable but there is no “racket” that I can see. As of October 2006 British Airways no longer allows passengers to check in their pets as excess baggage but requires them to be shipped by a freight forwarding agent who has an account with British Airways and books the space preferably a recognized pet travel agent at cargo rates.According to Ross Gays European director of WorldCare Pet Transport (www.worldcarepet.com) in London: “Other airlines may start to require pets to travel only through cargo systems via a pet travel agent not checked in as before by the accompanying owner as excess baggage.”But “cargo” costs a lot more than “excess baggage” because you are paying a freight forwarding agent who then has to pay the airline for the transportation. Mr. Gays estimates that transporting your dog as “excess baggage” would have cost £150 compared with the £650 you were quoted. “But your reader is getting a reasonable deal” Mr. Gays said. “We would have quoted more for the service that we provide.”You are not required to use one of the four pet travel agents suggested by British Airways: Airpets.com; Par Air (www.parair.co.uk); Whitelea Skydogs (www.skydogs.co.uk); and Pinehawk Livestock Shippers (44-1223-290249). You can use any accredited agent preferably a member of the Independent Pet and Animal Transportation Association (www.ipata.com). Who you choose may depend on price level of service and where you going.Air France allows pets to be checked in as excess baggage. But to fly nonstop from London to Nice you are limited to British Airways and easyJet which does not transport pets. (To fly Air France you must change planes in Paris.) — ROGER COLLIS

 9,Chris Kinzer kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired today to give Virginia Tech a 25-24 victory over North Carolina State in the Peach Bowl and give Coach Bill Dooley a triumph in his final game at the school.Erik Chapman the Hokies' quarterback led the winning drive by completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards in the final 1 minute 53 seconds. The drive was helped by a 15-yard pass-interference penalty on the play immediately before Kinzer's field goal.Mike Cofer had kicked a 33-yard field goal with 7:12 left to give North Carolina State a 24-22 lead.The contest completed an 8-3-1 season for Dick Sheridan the first-year North Carolina State coach who took over a program that had suffered through three consecutive 3-8 seasons.

 0,PUEBLO Colo. – Senator Barack Obama ridiculed the endorsement that Vice President Dick Cheney extended to Senator John McCain on Saturday asking voters here whether they believed that was a sign that Mr. McCain would take the nation in a new direction.“Do you think Dick Cheney is delighted to support John McCain because he thinks John McCain’s going to bring change?” Mr. Obama said. “Do you think John McCain and Dick Cheney have been talking about how to shake things up put Halliburton and get rid of the lobbyists and the old boys club in Washington?”Mr. Obama seized upon remarks that the vice president delivered at a Republican campaign event on Saturday in Wyoming where Mr. Cheney offered a forceful argument for Mr. McCain’s candidacy saying: “John is a man who understands the danger facing America he’s a man who has looked into the face of evil and not flinched.”For months Mr. Obama has been seeking to link Mr. McCain to the Bush administration. The comments from Mr. Cheney offered a fresh rationale for Mr. Obama which he pitched to Colorado voters in the second stop on a three-state that began in Nevada and ended in Missouri.“I’d like to congratulate Senator McCain on this endorsement because he really earned it. That endorsement didn’t come easy. Senator McCain had to vote 90 percent of the time with George Bush and Dick Cheney to get it” Mr. Obama said. “He served as Washington’s biggest cheerleader for going to war in Iraq and supports economic policies that are no different from the last eight years.”For Mr. McCain who has been working to distance himself from the administration the endorsement presented an awkward moment.A spokesman for the McCain campaign issued a statement responding to Mr. Obama’s remarks reminding voters that it was Mr. McCain who had opposed the Bush administration’s energy policy. Mr. Obama supported it.“Barack Obama and Dick Cheney aren’t just cousins they’ve shared support for the Bush energy policy and the out-of-control spending that John McCain has fought to oppose” said Tucker Bounds a spokesman for the McCain campaign.
 9,To the outside world however the girl in the modest-maiden dresses and modified bowl hairdo had been transformed into a poised and elegant fashion plate whose every style change influenced the way women around the well-dressed world stepped out.There were frequent reports and just as many denials from Buckingham Palace that the marriage was in trouble and that Charles and Diana were thinking of splitting up. Then in December 1992 Prime Minister John Major told a packed House of Commons that they had agreed to separate.The monarchy was faced with its greatest crisis since the abdication in 1936 of Edward VIII who was forced to give up the crown because of his love for an American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson.In 1994 Charles took part in a BBC documentary in which he admitted his adultery and dismissed suggestions allegedly from Diana that he was not fit to be King. She retaliated in 1995 with an equally bold television interview confessing her own extra-marital relationships her anger at the royal family her feeling that she was resented by her husband for attracting more favorable attention than he and her conviction that Charles would not make a good King. There were widespread reports that she wanted to see the crown go directly to her son William familiarly known as Wills.The British public has always been more smitten with Diana than with Charles a figure perceived as remote cool and unpleasantly eccentric. Her television interview was seen as much more convincing than his increasing her popularity and putting the British more than ever off the man destined to become their monarch. Just this month a poll said that for the first time a majority of the public did not believe that Britain needed a monarchy anymore a feeling only intensified by Diana's estrangement from Buckingham Palace and her seemingly heart-broken televised lament that ''there were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded.''Diana gained public sympathy with her admission of ''a feeling of being no good at everything and useless and hopeless and failed in every direction'' and her suggestions that it was Prince Charles and his coterie of male friends who held her up to such ridicule. She unblushingly talked of her humiliating affair with Mr. Hewitt saying she ''adored'' him and was ''very let down'' by his ending the relationship.With the divorce she had to give up being addressed as Her Royal Highness the honorific that separates the royal family's inner circle from other nobles and aristocrats. But she was able to keep the title Princess of Wales and she obtained a lump sum payment of $22.5 million and $600000 a year to maintain her offices. She also got to keep her five-bedroom four-reception-room apartment at Kensington Palace. Maybe most important she gained equal access with Prince Charles to her two children.

 0,Welcome to Watching The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site.Every month Netflix Canada adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for February broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. (Unfortunately streaming information provided in our Watchlist listings applies only to viewers in the United States.)Movies New to Netflix‘42 Grams’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeAs part of the wave of innovative Chicago fine-dining destinations chef Jake Bickelhaupt’s 42 Grams picked up two Michelin stars within a year of opening in part because of its uniquely intimate setting and ever-evolving menu. With Bickelhaupt’s wife Alexa running the front of the house the two entered into a successful partnership that nonetheless buckled under the combined stresses of their personal and professional lives. “42 Grams” offers up the eye candy of a typical foodie doc but it also witnesses the volatility and ego that sabotage their dreams.—‘Being John Malkovich’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Feb. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe screenwriter Charlie Kaufman burst onto the scene with this wholly original playfully surreal comedy about a portal into John Malkovich’s head that allows people to experience his state of being for 15 minutes at a time. Kaufman and director Spike Jonze delight in playing around in this metaphysical space while also offering up such absurd creations as an office space on a half-floor and a 60-foot Emily Dickinson puppet. Yet “Being John Malkovich” is sneakily moving turning on the common and melancholy yearning of what it’s like to want to escape your own skin.—‘Blue Crush’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeLoosely based on Susan Orlean’s magazine article “Surf Girls of Maui” this late-summer hit from 2002 may be primarily about beautiful beaches and bodies in motion but it overachieves in every respect. Director John Stockwell who made the fine teen romance “Crazy/Beautiful” has a good handle on the emotional state of a gifted young surfer (Kate Bosworth) who’s trying to make it back in the water after near-fatal incident. Her comeback follows the usual sports-movie formula but for surfing footage so spectacularly rendered that much is forgiven.—‘Friday Night Lights’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeBefore “Friday Night Lights” was developed into one of best dramas in recent network history it existed onscreen as a solid adaptation of Buzz Bissinger’s nonfiction book about a football-obsessed small town in Texas. Director Peter Berg doesn’t have time to explore fully the characters and social complexities of Bissinger’s book but he does capture the pressure-cooker atmosphere of a place where football is religion. All that pressure is brought to bear on the coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who’s expected to win every game or lose his job.—‘In Good Company’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like“In Good Company” has a record-scratch of a premise: A middle-aged advertising executive (Dennis Quaid) not only cedes his position to a new boss half his age (Topher Grace) he’s also dealt the added humiliation having that young man date his daughter (Scarlett Johansson). Yet writer-director Paul Weitz fresh off “About a Boy” works the premise through an unexpectedly low-key comedy-drama where the power dynamic between the two men shifts back and forth revealing vulnerabilities about each.—‘Moon’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Feb. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeDuncan Jones’s auspicious directorial debut feels composed of equal parts “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “Dark Star.” Like the “2001” it’s a metaphysical head-trip about an astronaut (Sam Rockwell) relying on a possibly diabolical sentient computer (GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey) for companionship. Like “Dark Star” it has an abundance of low-budget charm with a space station set that looks like an old rental and an openness to whimsy. Rockwell stars as a loopy energy contractor who’s thrown into chaos just as his final year on a lunar outpost is about to end.—‘Nightcrawler’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Feb. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeWith a title that sounds like a reference to a B-movie monster “Nightcrawler” offers a ferocious beast in its antihero (Jake Gyllenhaal) an amateur cameraman who seeks out grisly footage to feed the “If it bleeds it leads” maxim of local broadcasts. His combination of ambition shamelessness and moral vacuity makes him perfect for the job — and also the perfect target for the writer-director Dan Gilroy’s dark scabrously funny attack on media venality. Gyllenhaal’s natural charisma makes it frighteningly easy to accept his character as a go-getter type which allows Gilroy to escort the audience to some disturbing places.—‘Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane’Starts streaming: Feb. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe Rolling Stones haven’t exactly been hurting for documentary immortalization having already been the subject of films by the Maysles Brothers (“Gimme Shelter”) and Martin Scorsese (“Shine a Light”) just for starters. But the montage maestro Brett Morgen (“The Kid Stays in the Picture” “Jane”) cuts together a fascinating in-depth profile of the band from a combination of audio from new interviews and 50 years worth of archival film and video. If nothing else the film is a reminder that the Stones were once revolutionaries not just a bunch of dinosaurs playing the hits in football stadiums.—‘A Most Violent Year’Starts streaming: Feb. 7Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like“A Most Violent Year” is the perfect example of the type of top-drawer production that would have thrived in theaters in the ’60s and ’70s — it might have shared marquee space with a film like “Serpico” — but doesn’t fit any contemporary model for success. This superb third feature from J.C. Chandor (“Margin Call” “All Is Lost”) stars Oscar Isaac as a straight-arrow heating-oil magnate who has to bend the rules when payments on a new waterfront fuel yard come due and his drivers are suddenly harassed by violent carjackings. That leads some of the drivers to start carrying themselves. We watch as a good man is led down the road to corruption.—‘Midnight Special’Starts streaming: Feb. 7Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeIn his first big swing for the studio fences director Jeff Nichols (“Mud” “Take Shelter”) leaned heavily on Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” for inspiration but he couldn’t help making a Jeff Nichols film instead. Audiences didn’t know what to make of this interstellar curiosity but cult fandom surely awaits this story of a father (a typically wired Michael Shannon) who steals back his son — a boy with extraordinary and perhaps otherworldly powers — from a religious cult that has been built around him. “Midnight Special” has that “Close Encounters” mix of obsession and wonder but it is filtered through a more peculiar sensibility.—‘Django Unchained’Starts streaming: Feb. 15Feb. 15 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeQuentin Tarantino’s biggest hit is also among his most audacious a historical revenge fantasy along the lines of “Inglourious Basterds” but with the action leading to a Mississippi plantation during slavery. Tarantino tramples over any sacrosanct notions of how such a racially sensitive topic might be approached — and in the same year “12 Years a Slave” won an Oscar no less. But there’s plenty of righteous exploitation-style kick to this story of a freed-slave (Jamie Foxx) who teams up with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to liberate his girlfriend (Kerry Washington) from an evil slaver (Leonardo DiCaprio).—‘The Final Year’Starts streaming: Feb. 18Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeShooting over 90 days in 21 countries the documentary director Greg Barker expected to cement the legacies of three Barack Obama foreign policy appointees: Ben Rhodes the Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications; Samantha Power the Ambassador to the United Nations; and Secretary of State John Kerry. But the election of Donald Trump turned “The Final Year” into an excruciating run-down of hard-won negotiations and accomplishments that were deemed likely to undone by the coming administration. Depending on your political persuasion it’s either a bittersweet reminder of Obama-era policymaking or a cause for schadenfreude.—Netflix Original Movies‘On Body and Soul’Starts streaming: Feb. 2Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeNetflix gambled smartly by picking up this Golden Bear-winning Hungarian drama which just made the cut for an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film. Geza Morcsanyi and Alexandra Borbely star as workers at a slaughterhouse who happen to have the same dream every night where they’re deer that meet in the forest and fall in love. It seems only natural that the two are fated to be together but reality and dreams turn out to be some distance apart.—‘Seeing Allred’Starts streaming: Feb. 9Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe nation’s most prominent and controversial feminist lawyer Gloria Allred was in the news recently for representing one of the women accusing Roy Moore the Alabama Republican candidate for United States Senate of sexual misconduct with a minor. This admiring documentary profile from Sophie Sartain and Roberta Grossman catches Allred just as she was shining a big media spotlight on a wave of Bill Cosby’s accusers. But the film also takes a broader view of Allred’s advocacy for women and how it was able to develop considerable power.—Netflix Original TV Series‘Altered Carbon’: Season 1Starts streaming: Feb. 2Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThis promising (and expensive-looking) Netflix Original series has a “Blade Runner” look and an intriguing premise set in a future where human consciousness can be preserved on disks and transferred to new bodies. Joel Kinnaman plays one such body a handsome specimen with martial-arts skills who’s trying to solve a murder while experiencing echoes of previous corporeal forms. “Altered Carbon” has the look of modern noir — and a reputed abundance of sex and violence to match — but the premise opens up the possibility for a hard sci-fi treatment of memory and identity.—Also of interest (all categories): “About Time” (Feb. 1) “Apollo 13” (Feb. 1) “Chef” (Feb. 1) “The Danish Girl” (Feb. 1) “John Mellencamp: Plain Spoken” (Feb. 1) “Limitless” (Feb. 1) “The Mermaid” (Feb. 1) “Oculus” (Feb. 1). “Ray” (Feb. 1) “The Theory of Everything” (Feb. 1) “The Mindy Project”: Season 6 (Feb. 2) “Baywatch” (Feb. 9) “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman: George Clooney” (Feb. 9) “The Joel McHale show With Joel McHale” (Feb. 18) “Mama” (Feb. 19) and “Begin Again” (Feb. 26).

 0,Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery yesterday by Vice President Al Gore to the International Press Institute in Boston as provided by the Gore campaign:Twenty-five years ago today the last helicopters lifted off from the roof of our embassy in Saigon. Although that brought an end to the war in Vietnam -- a conflict I witnessed with my own eyes -- it did not bring an end to its influence on our thinking about foreign policy.Even now a decade after the end of the cold war we hear echoes of the old arguments. Some seem to believe that with the fall of the old Soviet empire we have nothing more to fear in the world and should dramatically cut our defense budget. Others keep insisting that we continue to prepare to face down a cold war threat that no longer exists and persistently ignore the world as it is. I believe that both groups are locked in a self-destructive argument over a false choice. . . .We are now in a new era. . . . We are now in a global age. . . .We need a new security agenda for the global age based on forward engagement. . . .In the global age we must be prepared to engage in regional conflicts selectively -- where the stability of a region important to our national security is at stake where we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest where we are certain that the use of military force can succeed in doing so where we have allies willing to help share the burden and where the cost is proportionate. America cannot be the world's policeman. But we must reject the new isolationism that says: Don't help anywhere because we cannot help everywhere. . . .

 0,There’s a line early on in “21 & Over” about your “oldest friends always being your strangest ones.” That may be true but there is a bigger theme here: After four years of college lifelong friendships can become forced resulting in awkward attempts to reconnect and relive the good old days.Not that the second point is explored with much depth in this movie about an odd couple — the motor-mouthed self-involved Miller (Miles Teller channeling a 1980s John Cusack) and the Wall Street-bound straight arrow Casey (the charming Skylar Astin) — who surprise their old pal Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) with a visit on his 21st birthday. Debauchery is expected for such a milestone but these guys get into more trouble in one night than members of this film’s target audience will encounter in their entire college lives.
 9,Still suffering from the lower back spasms that kept him out of the Nets' last two games on their West Coast trip last week Derrick Coleman didn't practice with his teammates yesterday. His status was listed as day-to-day. The Nets' next game is tomorrow night against the Atlanta Hawks at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.The 6-foot-10-inch Jayson Williams who has a sprained left ankle he suffered in Saturday night's victory over the Kings in Sacramento is definitely out for tomorrow's game so if Coleman is unable to play the Nets will have only one true power forward Rick Mahorn available.The Nets however have been getting along splendidly without the 6-10 Coleman by playing 6-11 backup center Chris Dudley at the big forward spot with 7-1 center Sam Bowie and 6-8 small forward Chris Morris and Mahorn contributing his savvy."It doesn't matter to Chuck Daly -- he'll play anybody who can get the job done" the Nets' assistant coach Paul Silas said of the team's head coach. "I think Chuck just has a great great way of motivating and not talking a lot."

White said: ''I doubt if the speedway will be there in 1984. It's just not economically feasible for the village.''Freeport stock car racing had a limited season from the end of May to September. Races ran on Friday and Saturday nights leaving the 13- acre 7500-seat track idle five days a week during the season.Last year the village asked the State Legislature to be allowed to sell the property to developers. Mayor White said that the village needs to increase its tax base and that the annual $70000 to $80000 received from the lease races gate parking and concessions was too little revenue. Francine Campion a member of the citizens' advisory committee created to study options for the property said ''People wanted the stadium to remain open not sold.''

 9,Kline May Sign On as Papp AideKevin Kline may soon be added to the list of directors whom Joseph Papp has hired to oversee programming at the Public Theater. Such a move some staff members feel could threaten the future of Mr. Papp's newly appointed artistic associate and apparent successor JoAnne Akalaitis. Mr. Papp is having discussions with Mr. Kline to supervise the Shakespeare marathon which began in January 1988 and which has so far included 15 of the 36 plays. Two of the more successful efforts have been Mr. Kline's "Hamlet" in which he starred and directed and "The Taming of the Shrew" with Tracey Ullman and Morgan Freeman directed by A. J. Antoon. Still Mr. Papp acknowledges he has been "unhappy with some of the work we've done" in the marathon.Staff members at the Public say he's also been uncertain about the long-term role of Ms. Akalaitis who has had trouble fitting in with the Shakespeare Festival's entrenched permanent staff. "She is very insecure and difficult to deal with and Joe hates insecurity more than anything" says one staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity adding that Ms. Akalaitis who is directing "Henry IV Parts 1 and 2" for a March 6 opening might not welcome reporting to Mr. Kline.Mr. Papp says: "Kevin Kline is one of our finest Shakespearean actors but he hasn't said yes yet. JoAnne Akalaitis is the best director we have and she will figure very prominently in the future of this institution." Mr. Papp says a lot also depends on Mr. Kline's film commitments. "We still need to formulate the relationships" he says. "Kevin might just direct or just act. He might also be on our board of directors. I want to hug him tighter to this institution." Mr. Kline's agent Jeff Hunter says "It would be premature to comment."Mr. Papp says he would like to see Mr. Kline create a small company using the talents of younger people. "I used to say that all you needed to do Shakespeare was two planks and a passion" he said. "I don't feel that way anymore. You need a psychological milieu which JoAnne knows how to create. Her 'Henry IV' is six hours of Shakespeare I really enjoyed. I think she and Kevin would make a wonderful alliance."

 0,You may never find a purple cow in real life but Zynga’s fortunes are very real.With its S-1 filing on Friday the profitable online game company now has a date with the public markets. Its initial public offering which is expected to value the company at $20 billion or more should yield a huge windfall for Zynga’s owners a small group of venture capital investors and senior executives.Who stands to gain the most?Mark Pincus Zynga’s chief executiveJim Wilson/The New York TimesBy far the founder of Zynga has the largest stake in the company. Mr. Pincus and his related entities own 91385846 class B shares about 16 percent of the pool. He also owns all of the available Class C shares (20517472 shares). Mr. Pincus who made $435000 in salary and bonus last year will not have to scrape by until the I.P.O. In March he sold 7840836 class B shares worth $109.5 million. The coming I.P.O. will not be the first for Mr. Pincus. The executive was the chairman of Support.com which went public in 2000. At the time he owned 17.1 percent of the company according to a 2000 filing and sold a portion of the stake in the I.P.O.Kleiner Perkins Caufield & ByersKleiner Perkins represented by Bing Gordon a partner in the venture capital firm and a Zynga board member led a $29 million funding round in the company back in June 2008. Through its investments the firm owns 11 percent of class B shares about 64.2 million shares.Union Square VenturesBack in January 2008 when Zynga was less than a year old Union Square Ventures decided to throw its weight behind the company leading a $10 million round (the first major funding round). “People already love to play casual games” Fred Wilson a partner at Union Square Ventures told The New York Times then. “But when you take a casual game and stick it inside a social network it becomes way more exciting. This is like pouring gasoline on fire.” His statement proved to be a sage bet. Union Square and its related entities own 5.5 percent of Zynga’s class B shares or 30.7 million shares. The firm managed to sell about $25 million worth of shares in January.Institutional Venture PartnersThe venture capital firm which has investments in Twitter and Netflix owns 34.3 million class B shares worth 6.1 percent of the pool.Foundry Venture CapitalFoundry was one of Zynga’s earliest backers. It started investing in Zynga in November 2007 (when it was named Presidio Media) and it participated in Zynga’s first major financing round in January 2008. Its managing director Brad Feld who founded the firm in 2007 has served on Zynga’s board since November 2007. In a 2008 blog post Mr. Feld said “Over the past six months I’ve become an incredible believer in the appeal of social gaming as a broad idea and see it as a disrupting force in the overall gaming industry.” The Foundry owns 34.6 million class B shares about 6.1 percent of the pool.Avalon VenturesThe venture capital firm owns 34.7 million class B shares which represent about 6.1 percent of total class B shares.D.S.T. GlobalIf it is a multibillion-dollar Web company on the verge of an I.P.O. the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner probably has a hand in it. His venture capital firm DST Global owns 32.8 million class B shares worth 5.8 percent of the pool. Unlike the other venture capital firms in this group DST was a bit late to the party. The firm made its first investment in late 2009. It led a group of investors in buying a $180 million stake.Bear in mind not all shares are created equal. Zynga’s I.P.O. features three classes of stock class A B and C. Class A shares will be issued to public shareholders while class B and C shares will stay in the hands of its top executives and venture capital investors. Although it is not clear how much voting control Mr. Pincus owns through his class C shares it is superior to class B which trumps class A. Mr. Pincus who owns all of class C will have more voting power as class B shares convert to class A (shares convert in the event of a sale).This may seem like a sour deal for Zynga’s public shareholders but the filing does provide fair warning:
 9,Although the eyes of Irving Texas and a national television audience will be on Joe Namath when the Jets play Dallas Saturday the eyes of the Jet defense will be on Roger Staubach and their legs will be trying to keep up with him.Staubach is ‘the daring quarterback of the Cowboys and right now he is in a singular position—he's one of the best running quarterbacks in the National Football League and he's the leading passer in the National Conference.Little wonder he presents problems for the defensive people.“No one's been able to stop him” Buddy Ryan the Jets’ defensive line coach said yesterday. “He's a different type of scrambler than Fran Tarkenton. Tarkenton is smart. He lays down before you get him. This guy keeps going. He thinks he's a running back. He's still trying to win the Heisman Trophy in the pros.”Staubach won the Heisman eight years ago as a junior at Navy. Four years of naval service including a year in Vietnam delayed his pro career but now in his third year as a Cowboy he's reaching the potential he showed as a collegiate star.

 9,Nettie S. Horch an arts patron and co-founder of the Master Institute of United Arts in New York City died at the Humana-Biscayne Hospital in North Miami on Monday. She was 94 years old and lived in Hallandale Fla.She died of bronchitis her daughter Oriole Farb Feshbach said.The Master Institute which began as a music school with a collection of Old Master art works was founded by Mrs. Horch in 1922 with her husband Louis. Its purpose was to help bring people together through the arts.In 1928 the Horches incorporated quarters for the Institute in a 29-story residential skyscraper they built at Riverside Drive and 103d Street. Their aim was to provide an environment of art and culture for apartment dwellers and they developed the concept that income from the apartments would support the art activities of the Institute. The building contained a 300-seat theater a non-profit school of fine arts studio apartments for musicians and dancers and the Riverside Museum a small vanguard institution that became known for showing work that differed from the prevailing currents in the art world. Equality in AcquisitionsMrs. Horch became the director of the museum which not only housed the couple's collection of Tibetan American and American Indian art but mounted many early shows by artists who were later to become well-known like Louise Nevelson. The museumdevoted a number of shows to the work of women and under Mrs. Horch's direction presented in 1939 the first exhibition by the Abstract American Artists whose work ran against the social realist trend of the time. The museum also gave shows to the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. In 1940 it mounted one of the earliest exhibitions of work by Puerto Rican artists.
 0,In the new church of American finance the first article of faith is progress. More and more goods and services will be produced with fewer and fewer hours of labor world without end.Evidence in support of this belief would appear to be conclusive. First there is the revolution in computer technology. Second there seems to be official affirmation in the national productivity statistics.To compute these statistics the Labor Department divides the volume of our national economic output by the hours worked to create it. In the third and fourth quarters of 1999 the productivity of American nonfarm labor rose at annual rates of 5 percent and 6.4 percent the fastest in years. Expectations are running strong that the next productivity report to be released on Thursday will be just as brilliant.It will be a miracle if it is. If the strength of the recent productivity reports seems unbelievable it is perhaps because they are. James Medoff a Harvard economics professor and Andrew Harless an economic consultant in Needham Mass. have uncovered deep-rooted flaws in the data. Their conclusion is that the numbers were distorted in the melee associated with the run-up to the year 2000. If they are right as it seems apparent they are the ''New Economy'' is about to lose some of its luster.
 9,Mr. Dillon who has been interviewed by investigators has said that he had weekly breakfasts on the day before the magazine was to be released with employees from the Donnelley plant in Old Saybrook Conn. investigators said.In addition Mr. Dillon has told investigators that similar trades based on the Business Week articles were made through accounts held in the name of Mr. Dillon's mother Elizabeth Baird and one of his friends Francis Roche. It is not clear whether his mother and Mr. Roche made the trades themselves.The account in Ms. Baird's name was maintained through the retail brokerage Quick & Reilly Group the investigators said. The account in Mr. Roche's name was kept at the Charles Schwab Corporation. Both accounts were maintained through branches in Connecticut.There was no answer at the telephone in Mr. Roche's home. Ms. Baird did not return a message left with a woman who answered her home telephone. Mr. Dillon did not return a phone message left on his answering machine at home. California Plant InvolvedThe second Donnelley plant based in Ventura Calif. became part of the investigation as a result of trades made through the Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. branch in nearby Anaheim.Officials from Prudential said that one Donnelley employee at the plant apparently traded on information from Business Week articles through an account at the Anaheim branch. The brokerage on Friday dismissed Brian Callahan the broker who oversaw the account after the account was suspended.Also under investigation by the S.E.C. are a second stockbroker at Merrill's New London branch a stockbroker at Advest Inc. in New London and three former brokers from the Hartford office of E.F.

 9,To the Editor:Re "The Making of a Tragedy" by Thomas Fleming (Op-Ed July 19): The Allies had many good reasons for not paying much attention to the German military's tardy resistance to Hitler but the underlying reason showed that the lessons of history can sometimes be properly applied.In 1918 the German generals were allowed to deal for peace the Kaiser was put on a train to the Netherlands in his pajamas and the Fatherland was left physically untouched. The resulting "stab in the back" myth and the glorification of the invincible German "front soldier" laid the foundations of World War II.The Allies were determined not to create a similar situation in 1944 insisting instead on total unconditional surrender. The message was to be unmistakable: You Germans are not invincible and have no one to blame for your destruction but your own leaders. Mr. Fleming writes that "unconditional surrender was a propaganda windfall for the Nazis."On the contrary this strategy won the peace. The West Germans became a nation of pacifists and did not look back fondly to those "fighting" days in occupied Poland. What they saw was simply too horrible. The Holocaust? Until 30 years after the war the murder of the Jews was hardly an issue in Germany.
 9,The dollar ended little changed against most leading currencies yesterday. It initially rose to a five-week high against the yen as traders assessed the United States impact of the vote in Quebec that narrowly rejected secession from Canada but the dollar then slipped back after the Mexican peso weakened."Canada helped the dollar and Mexico held it back" said Jay Westheimer senior currency trader with Banco di Sicilia in New York.Concern that a Quebec vote for independence would roil Canadian financial markets made market participants wary of holding too many United States or Canadian dollars during the last few days. After the slim vote against separation Canadian and United States markets surged yesterday morning driving both currencies higher."Investors are feeling a little more comfortable about investing in North America hence the dollar is benefiting" Charles Spence director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York said during morning trading.
 9,''The only people who did not lose money were those who couldn't put their hands on any'' said Mr. Prushi. ''There were people who sold their houses others sold their cows and now their children don't even have milk.''Mrs. Rinxhi reached for the cigarettes she started smoking again when the crisis began her eyes filling with tears. ''We are in a terrible situation'' she said. ''It can't be worse.''Today Mr. Xhaferri is in jail his fund seized by the Government; Marta the woman who ran the local Xhaferri office collecting wads of leks -- the Albanian currency -- from people who spent hours waiting in line has disappeared. And the people of Fushe-Kruja a shabby dusty town of 25000 responded last weekend by joining the rest of the country in street demonstrations which in some places have turned into near-riots.Thrown on the defensive the center-right Government of President Sali Berisha has promised to restore at least some of the missing money to the people on Nov. 5 to be distributed through savings account passbooks and options to bid on state property. The Government has also lashed out at its already feeble opposition and has blamed opponents for fomenting the violence last weekend.But here where the demonstrations were peaceful residents insist that the Government is to blame for the catastrophe that has befallen them. Like many others they are waiting to see if President Berisha fulfills his promise. ''We want our money'' said Mr. Prushi. ''We don't want pieces of paper.''Fushe-Kruja like many small towns in this nation of 3.5 million was a relative late-comer to the national craze which by October of last year had reached frenzied levels. By then funds like Xhaferri were stepping up efforts to collect more money opening new offices promising ever higher rates of return over ever shorter periods of time -- all signs that the bubble was about to burst.But when Mr. Xhaferri came here nobody really wanted to ask him hard questions like how he could promise to triple their money in three months in a country with meager investments and 20 percent unemployment.

 0,Last fall the racial skew in expulsion rates became a national issue after six black students in Decatur Ill. were expelled following a brawl in the bleachers at a high school football game and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's Rainbow/Operation PUSH Coalition filed a civil-rights lawsuit. The case was dismissed and the expulsions upheld but the testimony showed that blacks accounted for more than 80 percent of the district's expulsions over the last four years even though they make up less than half of the student body.That kind of racial skew is common in several aspects of education the study found. In all nine districts that provided statistics on academic placement by race the study found white students were disproportionately represented in advanced placement and gifted programs and minority students underrepresented.In San Francisco the study found that blacks and Latinos make up 42 percent of the student body but only 14 percent of those in advanced placement and gifted programs. And in Durham N.C. where blacks and Latinos make up 62 percent of the students they represent only 27 percent of the students in academically advanced classes. While few of the districts studied had large Asian-American populations the Asian-American students in most districts were overrepresented in advanced classes and underrepresented among those who were disciplined.The study asserts that the disparities amount to ''a deep pattern of institutional racism.'' But many education experts took issue with that conclusion. While the inequalities described in the study are distressing they say those differences like the well-documented racial gap on test scores do not necessarily add up to institutional racism.''Unfortunately we have a lot of history and evidence that schools tend to reproduce the economic and social disparities of the larger society'' said Robert B. Schwartz president of Achieve a school reform group made up of governors and corporate executives. ''We look to schooling to be this great equalizing engine but history hasn't been terrific on that score. Can one deny that racism persists? Of course not. But I think it's more complicated than racism alone. Obviously class plays into this and other factors.''

There have been suggestions that manual sweeping is the only way the streets will ever be made really clean.But Mr. Kretchmer said the cost of hand labor by sanitation men — who he said earned an average of $10500 a year with overtime — was becoming pro hibitive. He intends to rely heavily on mechanical aids to extend his manpower.One of these aids he was especially enthusiastic about was a three‐wheeled motor scooter with a dump body on which a sanitationman rides from street to street. The man still uses a hand broom to sweep up litter when he sees it but he shovels it onto the scooter and does not waste time walking and pushing a conventional wheeled barrel from one litter pile to another.

She had been using her free mornings to document the work of contractors clearing the lot next to her brick house on Irwin Avenue because she thought they were encroaching on her land.Ms. Bond Davis was also worried about the earth workers were removing near the base of a 210-foot-long retaining wall that propped up Riverdale Avenue atop a ridge overlooking her backyard.Ms. Bond Davis who was then appearing in ''The Women'' on Broadway was not the only one. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz drove by one day with Councilman G. Oliver Koppell and said ''It looks like an accident waiting to happen.''Two days later the wall collapsed. ''I thought I was in an earthquake'' Ms. Bond Davis said although she her house and her cat went unscathed. Steve Varkaris a partner of Outlook Realty the company that owns the land said the wall had collapsed because it was old and unsound.

 0,PhotoGeneral Manager Sandy Alderson has continued to make it clear through both actions and words that he is less than confident about the state of the Mets’ bullpen.Looking for a reliable arm for the middle innings he has added veterans like Pedro Feliciano Scott Atchison and LaTroy Hawkins on minor league contracts in recent days.But part of the concern has centered on closer Frank Francisco who will earn $6.5 million this season. Francisco who had 23 saves and a 5.53 earned run average during an erratic campaign last season had surgery in December to remove a bone spur from his elbow.Alderson did not hesitate to suggest during an interview Thursday night on SNY that the Mets could pursue a bigger name to help take care of the late-innings responsibilities.“Coming out of last season looking with what Frankie has been dealing with in the off-season as far as his elbow is concerned I don’t know that we could have a lot of confidence in where we are” Alderson said. “I hope that Frankie is able to step up. We’ve taken a lot of the time to look at other possibilities and ways that we can shore this up.”He added “I think we’re going to have another guy or two between now and spring training” though he did not specify what caliber of pitcher that could be.One option the Mets have considered is Jose Valverde who could compete for the closer role according to an ESPN New York report Friday.Valverde 34 saved 35 games for the Detroit Tigers last year but fell apart toward the end of the season. He posted a 5.02 E.R.A. in September and he was removed from the closer role by Manager Jim Leyland during the playoffs.As Alderson said the Mets are “not terribly comfortable” looking at Francisco as their closer. So the search for reliable arms will continue.Mets Sign Byrd The Mets signed the veteran outfielder Marlon Byrd to a minor league contract and invited him to spring training the club announced Friday night.Byrd 35 was an All-Star for the Chicago Cubs in 2010. Last year he batted .210 in 47 games combined for the Cubs and the Boston Red Sox. He was released by the Red Sox on June 12. Later that month he received a 50-game suspension for testing positive for Tamoxifen.

 9,To the Editor:Our Founding Fathers distinguished us from other countries by insuring that we would be free from the yoke of institutionalized religion. Contrary to Edward Morgan (Op-Ed Dec. 25) the Bill of Rights includes the right of freedom from religion as well as the freedom to practice any religion.The success rate of 80 percent that Mr. Morgan claims at the Bowery Mission is laudable. However you can just as easily point to the planning organizing leading and controlling -- that is good management -- as the reason the mission has achieved that rate. You could go further and ask whether many of people the mission serves are there because faith did not provide the tools to survive in our complex society.JORDAN KAPLANBrooklyn Dec. 26 1997The writer is an assistant professor of management at Long Island U.
 9,HOUSTON Nov. 30 — The baseball franchise of Richmond in the International League was sold today to Toledo Ohio but the team will continue to operate as the leading minor‐league affiliate of the New York Yankees.The sale announced at the annual meetings of the major and minor leagues will bring Toledo back into the high minor leagues after an absence of 10 years. The club had played in the American Association as the Mudhens and then the Glass Sox until 1954.The team at Richmond had been owned by the Yankees untill two years ago when it was bought by Romeo Champagne a supermarket executive from Manchester N. H. Last season it played to only 148000 persons continuing a decline that had started about three years ago.Champagne sold the franchise to the Lucas County Recreation Commission in Ohio for a price that was reported to be between $90000 and $100000.

 0,In this weekend’s Your Money column I take a close look at an ING Direct mortgage promotion that turned up in the mailbox at Bucks headquarters in Brooklyn. Turns out the company broke one Federal Reserve rule related to adjustable rate mortgage disclosures and didn’t meet my own common sense/raised eyebrow standard over all.This isn’t the first time I’ve had uncomfortable discussions with ING Direct about its mortgage marketing. A few months ago I had to convince the bank that the difference between percent and percentage points really did matter when you are promoting six-figure loans.I don’t do this sort of thing because I dislike ING Direct. Quite the opposite.Company executives talk about being on the side of the customer and trying to simplify things with every new product they offer.Given those high standards — and the fact that ING Direct ought to be standard bearers for its peers (even if their high-yield savings account rates don’t offer the best rates anymore) — the expectations are higher too. And the failures are all the more disappointing.So does a mortgage company have an obligation to say in all its ads and mailings how much an adjustable interest rate or payment may rise? Or is it enough to tell people later after they’re well into the application process?And what other bit of simplification or new information would you like to see in this industry? You can bet that Elizabeth Warren is thinking about these things since she’s made mortgages a high priority for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

 0,Netherlands vs. Brazil10 a.m. EasternTV: ESPN UnivisionThe Netherlands and Brazil two teams that have subjugated their natural swashbuckling impulses in favor of more measured approaches meet in Port Elizabeth for this much-anticipated quarterfinal match. The Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg was singled out for praise by his coach Bert van Marwijk after making two crucial saves in a 2-1 win over Slovakia in the Round of 16 on Monday. But Stekelenburg’s job becomes markedly harder against Brazil which scored three fine goals in its 3-0 win over Chile on Monday. Brazil’s defense led by the team captain Lúcio continues to look impenetrable while the team’s attacking stars — Robinho Kaká and Luís Fabiano — appear to be finding harmony at the right time.Uruguay vs. Ghana2:30 p.m. EasternTV: ESPN UnivisionTwo young strikers are the main attraction in this quarterfinal in Johannesburg. Luis Suárez 23 scored both goals for Uruguay in its 2-1 victory over South Korea last Saturday in the Round of 16. His superb play in South Africa should not come as a surprise to anyone who followed him last season at Ajax in the Dutch Eredivisie where he scored a league-high 35 goals. Ghana has relied on its own young star Asamoah Gyan for production. Gyan a 24-year-old forward nicknamed Baby Jet has scored three of the Black Stars’ four goals in this Cup including the match winner in extra time against the United States in the Round of 16 last Saturday.

 0,Opera management declined to comment saying it was still reviewing the lawsuit. "We will respond to it in an appropriate manner within an appropriate time frame" it said in a statement. "San Francisco Opera values its relationships with its unions and continues to look forward to working with them on these and all other issues." Ms. Vaness sharply disputed the union's characterization. She said it was common not to use typical contracts for such galas and that the singers felt no pressure. "Every single person at that gala that I know -- and I knew just about everybody -- was there with great respect for Donald Runnicles" she said. "I even popped out of a cake!"Some company members were also angered by Mr. Runnicles's pay. Tax documents show his salary for the 2002-3 season as $513000 a 42 percent increase over the previous year. The singers and dancers said that earlier this year they had agreed to a wage freeze for the next two years and a 2 percent increase after that because the opera was citing financial distress. Chorus members also took a de facto pay cut when the opera limited extra weeks of work during the season Ms. Heiber said. They earn $45000 to $55000 a year which she added is difficult to survive on in San Francisco.One chorus member who did not want her name published for fear of retaliation said she had no problem with Mr. Runnicles's earning what the market would bear. But many in the company she said resented his plea for them to make financial sacrifices without doing the same himself.Opera house officials said Mr. Runnicles was paid more because he conducted three additional productions for which guest conductors would have to have been paid.Mr. Runnicles well respected by many critics recently agreed to a three-year extension of his contract which would have ended in 2006. The announcement revived memories of his comments to an Austrian newspaper in August that he "would really have to think" about remaining in the United States if President Bush won re-election.

 0,The story’s political undercurrent lingered in the 1907 opera it inspired. Composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov it is a cartoonish political satire dressed up as a fairy tale in which he pushed his usual musical language — highly colored instrumentation sinuous melodies folk motifs — to a parodic extreme. “The Russia depicted in this opera is a caricature” the Princeton musicologist Simon Morrison said in a phone interview adding that the composer “contrasts this with a fantasy space of the exotic east.” In other words nothing in “Golden Cockerel” feels remotely real.Still the content was troubling enough to alarm the censors and delay its premiere. The opera opened in Moscow in 1909 after Rimsky-Korsakov’s death and was picked up a few years later by the Ballets Russes. In that version from 1914 staged by Michel Fokine the story was acted out by dancers while the singers and chorus sat in tiers on either side of the stage. The separation of the voice from the body made the similarity to puppet theater even more apparent.Fokine’s take was also less political not “a satire on royalty” he wrote in his memoirs “but on human frailty and weakness in general.” His characters were puppetlike in the style of Russian folk art echoed by the production’s spectacular designs by the avant-garde painter Natalya Goncharova: brilliantly colored vehemently two-dimensional almost childlike. Richard Hudson’s designs for the current production are based on Goncharova’s though not as exuberant. “I simplified some of the backcloths” he explained in an email from London “to achieve a clear sharp coherent stage picture.”In 1937 Fokine created a new one-act pure-dance version without singers. (The designs again were by Goncharova.) The cockerel which had been represented by a prop bird was now a ballerina on pointe. Extended excerpts were captured on film. (You can see them at the Public Library for the Performing Arts.)Fast forward to 2012 when the Royal Danish Ballet asked Mr. Ratmansky to create a new work for the company. He was intrigued by the lore surrounding the Fokine staging. “The first knock on the door for me was that Fokine said it’s his best ballet” said Mr. Ratmansky who expresses a great love of ballet history. “I thought it must be a very special thing.” He went back to watch the footage from the 1930s production and was persuaded to give it a try. His own version quotes just a few of Fokine’s movements particularly in the sharp jerky choreography for the cockerel. They are like a salute to the ballet’s past.Mr. Ratmansky’s two-act ballet opened to mixed reviews in Copenhagen in 2012; critics lauded the designs and the characterizations but some complained that there wasn’t enough dancing. For American Ballet Theater Mr. Ratmansky has added more. Even so there is more mime than most contemporary audiences are accustomed to all in the interest of conveying the fantastical story. The political subtext is not emphasized. “I mean what do I do put Putin makeup on the king?” Mr. Ratmansky asked with a wry laugh. “I wish I could be more daring in that sense but I don’t see how I can translate that. For me it’s about the music and visuals and characters.”
 0,Those differing perceptions of flood control help explain why Donald E. Powell federal coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding announced on Thursday that the levees in the New Orleans region that were being rebuilt would not meet the insurance standard of protecting against a 100-year flood the category that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.The announcement was in many ways a candid admission that the old ways of building flood protection no longer applied.Mr. Powell insisted that the $3.4 billion in work currently under way would make the levee system stronger than ever and prevent catastrophic failure in another storm of Hurricane Katrina's strength.But he said work to bring the levees up to the standard required by the insurance agency would require as much as $6 billion in additional spending to raise levee heights replace suspect floodwalls and take other corrective action.If FEMA cannot certify the flood-stopping power of the levees the agency's maps will have to treat them as if they are not there. In other words as if the land behind them is unprotected.That will have a significant effect on how neighborhoods will be rebuilt how high off the ground homes will have to be constructed and the cost of insurance.In the old days before Hurricane Katrina and before global warming experts assumed that New Orleans was protected by the levees that the corps had built. Since then however the emerging science of weather and climate change has led to an understanding that the world is entering a cycle of stronger and more frequent storms with higher surges and waves.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Problems with the original design have also been found.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyFundamentally the notion of what constitutes a powerful storm has been altered."We now have a new storm of record" Mr. Hitchings said. "Katrina."The data drawn from the experience of last August changes the equation of risk he said.For all the new data however the levee system that the corps has been building is largely based on a model of a hurricane derived from data first collected in 1959. By the 70's the National Weather Service had conducted new research that suggested that definition was too weak but the corps did not alter its plans to accommodate the new data."The corps once it's locked on a track will not take input from outside groups" said Ivor van Heerden a leader of the task force investigating the levee breaches for Louisiana and a professor with the hurricane center at Louisiana State University.In a recent interview Col. Lewis F. Setliff the head of the team rebuilding levees said the corps was not like the man on the street who is free to do what he pleases and change his mind at will. "We have to have a law in Congress that tells us to do something" Colonel Setliff said.Robert G. Bea a professor of engineering at the University of California Berkeley said the problem with that lack of flexibility was that "the data is not stable." Even the repairs Professor Bea said are problematic."They're building new walls but they're building them to the old standard" he said. "But we already know the old standard is inadequate."The corps has undertaken a two-year project at the request of Congress to propose substantial upgrades for hurricane protection in southern Louisiana. A preliminary report from that project is due in June with a final report in December 2007.If the study comes up with proposals for what the people of Louisiana say they truly want protection against the strongest Category 5 storms the cost would make the additional $6 billion look like a bargain. But it would more than exceed the insurance needs Mr. Hitchings said adding "Obviously if it was Category 5 it would be much bigger than 100-year protection."D. J. Nordquist a spokeswoman for Mr. Powell said that "there's obviously a bigger question" facing New Orleans which will always have the threat of storms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story"What level of protection are people comfortable with and what are they willing to spend?" Ms. Nordquist asked. "What's even feasible?"

 9,In a November 1995 ruling that upheld the zoning ordinance limiting the height of the landfill to 90 feet Superior Court Judge Charles D. Gill noted that Waste Management had made approximately $50 million in gross revenue during the two preceding years in which the validity of the ordinance was being appealed.The appeal now pending in the State State Supreme Court is the second time the case has been before the state's highest court. In July 1995 the court ruled 5-0 in favor of the town's position. That decision reversed two lower court rulings that had gone in favor of Waste Management in 1993. And those proceedings had been in the legal pipeline going back to 1990. But as early as 1985 Waste Management had apparently caught town officials off guard when it petitioned the state for permission to expand the dump to 190 feet from 90 feet.While Waste Management published a notice of its application for a modified permit in local newspapers ''no comments were received from New Milford town officials'' the Supreme Court ruling noted. After the State Department of Environmental Protection granted the permit in February 1987 ''no appeal was taken'' by the town the court said.Liba Furhman the New Milford Mayor from 1991 until last year said that zoning officials never received notice of the permit application; her predecessor since deceased denied any knowledge of the application which would have gone to his office first. And the newspaper notice was published she said on New Year's Eve drewing no notice in the town.Mrs. Furhman a Democrat also noted that the town was handicapped in its dispute with Waste Management because of its lateness in adopting zoning regulations. New Milford was she said one of the last municipalities in the state to adopt relevant zoning regulations.In 1971 the town adopted zoning statutes that prohibited a landfill in an industrial zone. But the landfill on Route 7 existed prior to the regulations and it thus became a ''permitted nonconforming use'' the court decisions have noted. The prior owner of the dump had received a permit from the state to operate the landfill to a maximum height of 90 feet after which the subsequent owner Waste Management sought and received permission to increase the height to 190 feet leading to the legal confrontation.''It is a period in my life that I'd like to forget'' Mrs. Furhman said of the town's fight with Waste Management.

 9,So buyers who feel little nostalgia for the LP era may feel shortchanged by the new reissues. Obviously the recital records could have been combined in a multidisk set with the original breakdown of programs indicated in the booklet. Still the recordings sound splendid and it is good to have them all back.The ''Poliuto'' performance which shows Callas at a crossroads in her career has circulated in pirated recordings and for some years on the Melodram label; this is its first EMI release (65448; two CD's). When she appeared in this production which opened the 1960 season at La Scala Callas had been absent from the company for two years because of an acrimonious dispute with its director Antonio Ghiringhelli. It was a time of vocal insecurity for her. Her decision to return in a role new to her from a little-known opera dominated by a tenor bewildered many Callas fans at the time.The opera based on a play by Corneille and set in Armenia in the third century deals with a spiritual crisis of the nobleman Poliuto who converts to Christianity risking persecution by the country's Roman occupiers. ''Poliuto'' though a stylistic hybrid is a work of ambition and grandeur with crowd scenes anticipating the brassy Triumphal March of Verdi's ''Aida.'' The title role requires a tenor with lyricism and agility but also power and stamina. The Scala production conducted sensitively by Antonio Votto featured Franco Corelli who lacked bel canto lyricism but had power galore.Callas sings Paolina Poliuto's wistful deferential wife who married him only after her true love the Roman consul Severo had (mistakenly) been reported killed. Paolina is so moved by Poliuto's courage in the face of persecution that in a transforming final scene she follows him into the arena where death awaits.No doubt Callas chose this role in part because it allowed her a cautious way back into a company with which she had had a pivotal if tumultuous relationship. But here in any case is a searching intelligent artist characteristically championing a neglected work and finding dramatic resonance and musical complexity in a role thought to be secondary. Her singing is sometimes shaky with wobbly vibrato and chancy high notes. But this is a deeply felt subtly phrased arrestingly vivid portrayal. The sound quality is adequate for a live recording. The audience interrupts with frequent ovations which merely underscore the sense of event in Callas's difficult homecoming.The ''Live in Concert'' set (72023; two CD's) begins with Callas in 1935 not yet 12 singing ''Un bel di'' from Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' on the ''Major Bowes Amateur Hour'' radio broadcast. Because her father was opposed to her performing in public she had to use a pseudonym Nina Foresti. For a pre-teen-ager the voice though tremulous is remarkably bright and full of temperament.

 9,"People come here from all over the city. It's important to keep it going. It's the kind of education I believe in."Hooker's reputation is so strong that out-of-district families are regularly turned away for lack of room. Many are drawn by the rich diversity of the student body. Over a third of the students about 90 children come from abroad -- from Norway and Nigeria Yugoslavia and Venezuela China Korea and Japan. Mr. Angeletti said that some families have opted for Hooker over private schools in the city. Many of these families come to New Haven because one or both parents are Yale graduate students. Often they must leave before their children reach the fourth grade. 'A Good Foundation'Recently Nwabata Oputa from Nigeria celebrated her sixth birthday in Mary Burns's first-grade class. The happy occasion was tinged with sadness because the little girl's mother Alexandra Oputa explained that the family was moving to the South in the winter."Bata got a good foundation here" her mother said. "She was blessed to have wonderful teachers." When the family moves Hooker will lose one of its faithful cafeteria volunteers."Many want to stay but can't" said Mrs. Burns who has taught in the New Haven school system for 29 years 12 of them at Hooker. "Most only stay two or three years. This school is special."The children said they valued their diverse classmates. "I have special friends from Korea and China" said Leah Pillsbury a fourth grader. Her friend Emily Williams reported "Foreign students are cool especially because I got to tutor a Chinese boy in reading." For tiny Terri Ramiah a first grader from Malaysia Hooker is special because "they give you books to read and it is not as hot as home 100 degrees."The school has a teacher who works full time with children who need help in mastering English. The teacher Joan R. Carroll meets with each of her charges 30 minutes a day.

 0,Although it bears the title ''Two Women'' Tahmine Milani's film is really about one. And her name is legion.While ''Two Women'' is set in Iran the suffering woman at its compassionate heart may be found wherever those like her are denied a right to education and work are oppressed and abused by husbands are stalked by violent obsessive men and are denied recourse in court.''I am a human being!'' she cries in despair at one point. But almost no one seems to care.Ms. Milani's impressive unsettling deeply felt film about a brilliant young woman trapped and reduced to hopelessness in a society that accords her no right to equality is said to have proved a sensation when released last year in Iran. ''Two Women'' may be seen at tonight and tomorrow in the 29th New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art.The women of the title are Fereshteh and Roya who meet as university students in Tehran and become fast friends in the tumultuous period of the Iranian revolution of the late 1970's when factions dedicated to the clerical forces of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini clashed with westernized intellectuals and liberals on campuses.
 0,Stanford played Georgia Tech in the Seattle Bowl last Thursday losing by 24-14 to the Yellow Jackets who were led by the interim coach Mac McWhorter. The Cardinal finished 9-3 this season. Although Stanford has had three losing seasons since 1997 it was 44-36-1 and played in four bowl games during Willingham's seven seasons the most prominent being the Rose Bowl after the 1999 season. Stanford won the Pac-10 title and he was named the conference's coach of the year that season.Willingham took over as head coach when Bill Walsh left after the 1994 season. Before that he was an assistant to Dennis Green with the Minnesota Vikings and at Stanford where he was the running backs coach from 1989 to 1991.Willingham has shown that a black coach can succeed at a major college. But blacks make up less than 5 percent of the head coaches among Division I-A programs according to a study released last summer.''Having Notre Dame make this decision might be the first time that we open the doors to the possibility of a much broader opportunity for people of color to be hired in positions of responsibility'' said Richard E. Lapchick the author of the study and the director of the sports business management program at Central Florida.Willingham was first contacted by White after Davie was fired said Gary Migdol an assistant athletic director at Stanford. Then came Notre Dame's fiasco with O'Leary. But Willingham could not negotiate seriously with White until Stanford played its bowl game said Migdol who described the talks as a ''start-and-stop situation.''The O'Leary incident turned out to be the latest in a string of public embarrassments for Notre Dame. The most prominent involved a former booster who gave gifts and money to players after embezzling $1.2 million from her employer. She was sentenced to jail in 1998 and the football program was placed on probation for the first time in December 1999.It was one of several aspects of Davie's five-year tenure that Notre Dame would rather forget. He finished with a 35-25 record the third-worst winning percentage for a Notre Dame coach. But Davie who was promoted from defensive coordinator to succeed Lou Holtz had a 100 percent graduation rate among his players last year.
 0,Although I had been writing about food for several years before going to New York magazine nothing took off quite the way it did once I started working for Clay Felker.For one thing he realized the value of service pieces and respected them. Before that they were considered a sort of dirty commercial kind of journalism if indeed the word was even applicable. He once told me: “More people care about finding a great brownie than about most world affairs. They can do something direct about the brownie but not much about the rest.”What made it such fun to work there was the in-your-face tone the magazine took the fact that it was an upstart and that there was such great talent. Most of all though writers could say there what could not be said in most any other publication at the time something that made us all willing to work almost for nothing. That was fortunate because that is just about what we were paid. But what a showcase!Clay also knew when to clear the decks at the last moment to accommodate a great piece. When I wrote “I Tasted Everything in Bloomingdale’s Food Department” — something that took me 11 months to do — he had me report individually on 1196 items killing some other pieces he had planned to run.He also had a great way of inspiring young writers as I saw when I spoke at one of his classes in magazine development at Berkeley where he could play devil’s advocate to get students thinking.Clay could talk himself into very strange fixed ideas that he defended loudly and aggressively. One day during an argument with someone he declared that Catholics can’t cook. Seeing me in the office he said “Let’s ask Mimi.”When I answered “Catholics? You mean like the French and the Italians?” he stopped talking to me for two weeks. But as far as I know I had not changed his mind.Before serving as food critic of The Times from 1975 to 1983 Mimi Sheraton was a contributing writer at New York magazine from 1970 to 1975. A Brooklyn native and New York University graduate she has also written written on food and travel for numerous other publications including Seventeen Time Smart Money Harper’s Bazaar Vogue The Village Voice Vanity Fair Esquire and Mademoiselle. Her most recent book is “Eating My Words: An Appetite For Life” (William Morrow 2004). She has lived in Greenwich Village for more than 60 years.

 9,Innovative jazz and mainstream popular music grew further and further apart in the 1940's and 50's. Jazz singers still had their pop hits but you certainly couldn't say that singers like Anita O'Day Billy Eckstine Sarah Vaughan or Mel Torme were at the center of the culture's consciousness; they were on its vigorous borders or in its vanguard. Of the mainstream performers who made their names in the war and postwar years Sinatra Ms. Lee and Cole (despite the trash he sometimes had to record) were the hit makers who kept the jazz-pop links center stage. (Doris Day was a very good singer but she concentrated on movies not recordings.)Sinatra's other great gift of course was his sexual charisma. Whatever he sang it was there. The jaunty manliness was sexy; so was the melancholy introspection; so was the edgy rebelliousness one saw most clearly in his best film performances. He was a star and he had what real stars have: the ability to take their gifts their limitations and their influences and mold them into a unified whole called My Personality. The force of that personality is what makes Sinatra unforgettable.But why claim as some do that Sinatra was the first popular singer to think of himself as an artist? Surely we don't still believe given the evidence of the work they put in (the practicing the jam sessions the attention paid to opera singers actors horn players and their own own peers) that the masters of the preceding generation didn't know they were artists. Holiday Armstrong and Mabel Mercer -- the English song-actress nonpareil whom Sinatra called a major influence along with Holiday and Tommy Dorsey -- all wore an armor of modesty in public but that shouldn't fool us anymore. They knew their worth.It has been very unpleasant reading these eulogies to see how segregated racially and sexually views of popular music remain. And wearying to have to note that nearly all of the pre-Sinatra innovators who are left out of this musical hagiography are blacks and women. In my generation this is called the Elvis Presley syndrome. The setting: A fertile but largely unformed musical world. The action: He arrives.It makes one remember that preferential treatment based on race and gender has always been the norm in American life; it is only the beneficiaries who have changed in the last few decades. For all of his talent and drive Sinatra benefited greatly from the preferential treatment given his race and gender as if by natural right in those days. (So for all of his greatness as a dancer did Fred Astaire.) Not only did Sinatra have unparalleled power in the music industry he got to act out a lavish drama of masculinity that thrilled the entire culture.What black man could have gotten away with such cocky brashness and become a star of that magnitude? (Witness the unusually passive public demeanor of Cole.) What woman of either race could have? They simply could not have seized the imagination and approval of a mass audience with such open displays of power and nose-thumbing.Sinatra was a great performer because he joined kinetic musical force to what looked and sounded like pure naturalism. It was also his great good fortune to come of age in a time when the world still considered whiteness and maleness the best and most natural of states.

Fisher of Detroit and the late Mr. Fisher who with his brother Fred J. Fisher in 1908 organized the Fisher Body Company now a part of the General Motors Corporation.
 9,On another level ''Rhapsody in August'' is also the director's first film in years that is essentially a family drama unfolding in an intimate setting a far cry from the fantastic milieus of ''Akira Kurosawa's Dreams'' or the outsize historical epics of ''Ran'' ''Kagemusha'' and other recent movies. In the film community Mr. Kurosawa's autocratic style and mania for perfection have earned him the sobriquet the Emperor. Indeed on the set crew members run not walk at his directions and one can see that his sense of control is total.''I was surprised to see he was even more of an emperor than I really thought he'd be'' said Mr. Gere. ''He's had his team together so long and he is the Great Man of Japanese cinema. If he calls out an actor's name the actor steps forward with a 'Hai! Domo arigato!' '' (''Yes! Thank you!'') Another famous characteristic of Mr. Kurosawa's film-making is his shooting every scene with two or three cameras none of them close up. Mr. Gere said the director explained to him that if the actors don't know which angle is being shot they act more naturally.''My argument to him was that you're not taking advantage of a trained actor who can focus his energy at the camera lens if he knows where the light and camera are coming from'' Mr. Gere recalled. ''I was very open with him about that and I think people on the set were a little shocked.''One More ChanceOver the years Mr. Kurosawa has clashed with producers and critics on a Shakespearean scale and what some say is his compulsiveness led to his suicide attempt in 1971 after a series of painful setbacks.But in a remarkable change of heart Mr. Kurosawa's backers for ''Rhapsody in August'' are a consortium of 18 Japanese companies put together by the Shochiku Company a leading movie company that walked away from Mr. Kurosawa after backing ''The Idiot'' a critical and financial failure made in 1951.Industry people say that decades after shunning Mr. Kurosawa Japanese businesses have come to recognize the public relations value of supporting the recipient of every honor the film industry has to offer including a special Academy Award last year for lifetime achievement.
 9,But when a company like Hotmail with no real revenue to speak of is sold for $400 million other companies may feel like failures in comparison -- even when they are sold for three to five times the amount their investors put into them.In the pre-Internet days a return of five times invested capital would have been terrific. But venture capitalists like myself will be judged not only by the absolute dollars we return to our investors or the internal rate of return on the capital invested but against our peers many of whom have seen $2 million investments turn into $1 billion in value in three to five years -- thanks to those runaway stock prices.This unrealistic comparison threatens the foundations of one of the most remarkable constructs of a capitalist economy. The business of venture capital providing growth financing to entrepreneurs in exchange for equity in fledgling or semi-established companies can be a superb engine of economic growth creating an enormous number of jobs and fueling an entrepreneurial spirit essential to a healthy economy.But when a company with no visible means of support let alone a plan to generate revenue sells for $400 million even normally sharp-witted venture capitalists lose their minds. In a mad scramble they start outbidding each other to provide capital to what they hope will be the next Hotmail. So what? Who gets hurt? The entrepreneurs.I know one chief executive who has worked day and night for three years to build his Internet software company. He has suffered through all of the dysfunction and pain of nurturing a start-up. This year in the first full year of selling his product his company is the No. 1 or No. 2 player in the market (depending on which research report you believe) he has more than 1200 customers and has expected annual revenues of $3.5 million to $4 million. And he may turn cash flow positive sometime in the fall. Not bad by anyone's measure right? Wrong.He thinks he has failed. Given the economics of the software industry the likely exit scenario for this company is a sale to another software company. The likely price will be somewhere just below $50 million. But if that happens the chief executive told me he will have failed.And so will his investors. After three or fours years of work he will walk away with ''only'' $2 million to $3 million. And the investors will see a return of ''only'' 200 percent to 300 percent. So to avoid the perceived failure he will probably choose to hang on longer than he should in pursuit of a market that simply may not be big enough to support his enterprise as a stand-alone company. And he and his investors instead of cashing in will sit at the table too long and possibly walk away with nothing.John Doerr a much better-known and wealthier venture capitalist than I is often quoted as saying that the Internet represents the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. So far Internet stocks seem to be proving him right. For my part I just hope he is not the yardstick against which we will all be measured.
 9,Teodoro Garcia a reluctant Mexican lieutenant who battled the rebel Pancho Villa in the Mexican Revolution and is believed to be the last soldier in the army of the dictator Porfirio Diaz died last Saturday in a retirement home in Texas City Tex. He was 110.''He was the last Federal'' said Manuel Urbina 2d a professor of Latin American history at the College of the Mainland in Texas City and an expert on the survivors of the Mexican Revolution. ''There are a few very few who fought with Villa and others and who are still alive because they were 11- 12- 13-year-old boys or they fought with later factional governments during the revolution. But Garcia was the last who fought with Diaz.''Mr. Garcia was born into a family of prosperous landowners on Jan. 7 1889 in Sacramento in the Mexican state of Coahuila about 100 miles southwest of Laredo Tex. Although he sympathized with the poor he made an offhand promise to a friend that he would join the Federales a name for Diaz's army if they ever passed through town. When they did a few weeks later the young Garcia felt that as a matter of honor he had to enlist.Joining the Federales -- the name now refers to the Mexican federal police -- was also somewhat expected of Mr. Garcia. His family after all had about 40 peones on its hacienda and President Diaz was battling civil insurrection. As it turned out Mr. Garcia fought on the losing side. Diaz in power since 1876 was overthrown in 1911 by Francisco Madero with the help of Villa the revolutionary leader in the north of Mexico and Emiliano Zapata the leader in the south.

 9,* To the Editor:Your July 26 editorial on the costs of free concerts suggested that they could just as well be held in a stadium. But the reason they are held in Central Park is that people like to be around growing things once in a while.It's a different sort of atmosphere.In theory the park is there to be enjoyed; if it gets damaged you fix it. If funds are not available for music that draws 350000 or more people then what are we all working and building tall glass towers for?Meanwhile who gave Henry Stern the Commissioner of Parks the authority to decide that The Clash (punk-rock group) can't play in the park (news story July 26)? Seems to me like a lot of power over what we hear and think. DAVE LIPPMAN New York July 26 1983

 9,In June the Comptroller completed an audit of the way the board keeps track of televisions and other audio-visual equipment purchased for schools. Equipment MissingLast year auditors visited 10 of the city's 150 high schools selected at random to inspect inventory records according to Roger D. Liwer Deputy Comptroller for audits. In the 10 schools they discovered that much equipment was missing including 25 televisions 45 videotape machines 75 tape players and five video cameras worth a total of $77000 Mr. Liwer said.The most serious problems were at Julia Richman High School on East 67th Street in Manhattan where 55 appliances worth $15000 were missing the report said. In a written response to the auditors Theodore Bronsnick an acting assistant principal at Julia Richman acknowledged that the missing items had probably been stolen. At Herbert Lehman High School on East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx however where 42 appliances worth $8400 were missing Robert Leder the principal told auditors that school officials had simply discarded old and unusable equipment without deleting it from board inventories.The auditors' attempts to trace the missing items were complicated because in most cases there were no records to confirm that the equipment had ever been delivered to the schools Mr. Liwer said.The Bureau of Supplies buys pencils notebooks and other high-volume products in vast quantities storing them in its central warehouse at 44-36 Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City Queens for distribution to schools. But to supply schools with costlier items like computers and televisions the bureau has commercial suppliers deliver equipment directly to schools. Criticism IgnoredIn five separate inspections of the bureau from 1992 through 1993 by the Comptroller's office and by Ernst & Young the accounting firm auditors criticized the bureau for paying for televisions and other equipment as soon as suppliers billed the board without confirming deliveries Mr. Hevesi's report said. Each time the supply bureau ignored the criticisms the report said.In June the bureau also rejected Mr. Hevesi's recommendation that it establish procedures to confirm deliveries before payment.

 9,''The differential is so small and the number of women at selective colleges is more than the number of men so I don't think it has had much of an effect'' he said.But Monty Neill executive director of Fairtest an advocacy group based in Cambridge Mass. said the gap was ''clearly significant because college admissions are in part decided on these tests and a lot of special programs and scholarships are largely awarded based on test scores.''''Our view is that the test itself is biased'' she added.White students also continued to do better than most underrepresented minorities. White students showed a one-point gain on the verbal test and no gains on the math test over last year's results. Scores for black students remained the same on the verbal test and fell four points in math.Overall scores for Hispanic students were also lower except for Puerto Rican students whose scores were up three points in verbal and one point in math.The Educational Testing Service the company that administers the College Board tests is in the early stages of developing a formula to help colleges adjust scores for members of minorities and other students who have fewer educational advantages providing a kind of handicapping system.Those efforts College Board officials said yesterday did not suggest that the current scores were less valid.''Looking at SAT scores in a broader context is something admissions people have done for years'' said Gretchen Rigol vice president for special projects at the College Board. ''Though there are lots of people interested in this research it is far from being operational.''
 0,Summer has barely begun but already advertisers are thinking about buying commercial time during Super Bowl XXXVIII to be broadcast on CBS on Feb. 1.One advertiser buying time is a Super Bowl newcomer the Procter & Gamble Company.

Procter has advertised before and after Super Bowls but never during the game.Advertising Age reported that CBS part of Viacom had already sold about a third of the total commercial time during the game at an estimated average price of $2.4 million for each 30-second spot.

 9,For Waffles and Pancakes Picasso Would LoveSix maple trees growing upside down in an art installation in the courtyard of Mass MOCA the new modern art museum in North Adams Mass. are the inspiration for but not the source of a new maple syrup sold in the gift shop. Appropriately enough it's called Upside Down Maple Syrup. In a display there a can of it is suspended from wires much the way the trees have been since spring.The installation ''Tree Logic'' is by Natalie Jeremijenko an Australian experimental artist. The trees -- flame maples not sugar maples -- are expected to be on display for at least a couple of years with their roots in big buckets of earth. The idea is to see how the branches and leaves will grow.As for the syrup the only unusual thing is the label. It's good grade-A amber syrup from the Berkshires excellent on pancakes or even to sweeten an upside-down cake. An eight-ounce tin is $9.95 with the proceeds benefiting the museum (shipping is $3). To order: (413) 664-4481.Instant Coffee Real FlavorA serious java-head has little use for instant coffee. The convenience is usually not worth the compromise in flavor and aroma. But a new instant coffee Samba from Brazil is an exception. It is a blend of robusta and arabica beans and has enough full-bodied richness and true coffee aroma to make for a reasonably satisfying cup. It's excellent for recipes that call for coffee liquid or powdered. With a small jar tucked into a carry-on bag you have the makings for a good cup of coffee on a plane. A two-ounce jar is $2.45 at A.&P. supermarkets. Waldbaum's and Pathmark are some other chains that sell it.
 9,NEW ROCHELLE N.Y. June 1 (AP) —Pat Bradley is serving notice to everyone else entered in the $100000 Ladies Professional Golf Association tournament that starts tomorrow at the Wykagyl Country Club that she intends to retain her title. The event has been increased to 72 holes and has a first prize of $15000.Miss Bradley a fourth‐year pro now 26 years old did not achieve her first major victory until competing here last season. At that it took a four‐player two‐hole sudden‐death playoff before accomplishing the feat.“I'm ready” said Miss Bradley before competing in today's pro‐am. “As a matter of fact I'm playing quite well and I'm so excited. Everything is going really well. My iron and putting games are stronger. And I'm stroking the ball well. If I make a few putts the rest of the field better watch out. I'm in the same position now as I was last year.”
 9,More Than LandAnd land was not the half of it. There were the shipping interests which perhaps accounted for the newspaper's enthusiasm for the San•Pedro harbor and an annexation of Hawaii: the automotive interests (Goodyear Tire and Rubber) and road construction interests (Western Construction) and gravel and rock interests (Southern California Rock and Gravel Consolidated Rock Products) and oil interests (Royal Dutch Shell. Union Oil) which perhaps accounted for its disdain of mass transportation systems. The Times also helped to turn Southern California into one gigantic traffic circle from which there seems to be no egress under the thumb of smog.Not to mention the Santa Anita racetrack the Los Angeles Philharmonic the chief of police and the Republican Party.No wonder organized crime never had much of a chance in Los Angeles. The Chandlers and their various syndicates ran everything except the vice racket. No wonder a nonentity like Norris Poulson could be elected Mayor three times. Times political columnists decided who was electable. No wonder the Watts. riots came as such a surprise. The Times hadn't reported on the existence of Watts.Aficionados of modern journalism will be most interested in the last third of “Thinking Big” which is the story of how The Times changed itself after 1960 from a right‐wing parochial rag into one of the nation's finest newspapers from a sponsor of Norris Poulson to a sponsor of Tom Bradley. is also the fascinating story of the politics of culture of the reign of Dorothy (Buffy) Chandler over the institutions of spiritual uplift. And it usefully describes the new power elite of Los Angeles in which there are actually some Democrats and Jews.But I found myself absorbed in the early years. Every dynasty is started by some sort of bandit. General Otis certainly wrote like a bandit: “The apostles of disorder the missionaries of unrest the jawsmitbs of closed‐sho•p unionism the haters of honest industry the acquisitionists of other people's property the enviers of other people's prosperity the brawlers the larcenists the dynamiters the I.W.W.'s and the friends of raising the devil generally are flocking to the standards of Absalom. The air is incarnadined and made mephitic with their presence.”

 9,Last Sunday the 11 A.M. Polish-language Mass at St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Church was jammed with a standing-room crowd of 500. It was attracted by the newly crowned Miss Polonia who will represent the parish at today's Pulaski Day parade in Manhattan and an afternoon raffle for tickets to Pope John Paul II's Mass at nearby Aqueduct race track on Friday.The excitement in the church was palpable but it was heightened by the fact that the parishioners actually had a church in which to worship.Three weeks ago St. Stanislaus Church at 88-10 102d Avenue in Ozone Park reopened after a suffering a devastating fire on June 20 1994. There were no injuries and firefighters extinguished the flames before they spread to the St. Stanislaus grammar school next door but the ceiling of the 65-year-old church was destroyed and there was extensive smoke and water damage."One of the priests called me at work and asked had I left any equipment in the church that there had been a little fire" said Michael Zybrocki 35 a systems analyst for Nynex who plays the church's pipe organ and has led its choir for 15 years. "When I got off the subway after work I couldn't believe it. There were hordes of people out in the street crying and hugging each other."

 9,Mr. Gore who had a fatal heart attack in 1986 while hiking set the policy that no more than 200 people should work under one roof. One day in 1965 when he was walking through his flourishing plant he realized he no longer knew everyone. From that came the growth strategy to ''get big by staying small.''''The physical 'feel' of the company's buildings has always been very important to the whole Gore family'' said Mr. Hill who started with the Gores 36 years ago in the basement of the Gore home. ''We want our employees to feel good about where they work. We spend more on our cafeterias than we do on our lobbies.''Gore's president the 59-year-old Robert W. Gore the son of the founder was the creator of the Gore-Tex technology. He often walks the sites taking an interest in details down to the plantings.Mr. Hill said the under-200 strategy costs more in terms of land and overhead since each building must have its own cafeteria conference room and loading docks. It also requires that each location have a receptionist a custodial staff and personnel director.He said the policy probably cost Gore at least 20 percent more for its buildings than would a conventional real estate program. But the gains in efficiency flexibility and teamwork more than offset the extra expense Mr. Hill said.''I think our track record has proven it works'' he said. ''We really do think of ourselves as a small company.''As a privately held company with most of the stock held in a trust set up by the Gores the company has the flexibility to make decisions based on a longer-term outlook Mr. Gore said.

 0,Republicans were growing increasingly confident on Saturday that they would win the Iowa Senate race picking up a Democratic-held seat that could ensure that they gain the majority.Democrats were less certain Iowa was slipping from their grasp pointing to their success in persuading voters who do not typically cast ballots in midterm years to vote early.In conversations Saturday with officials in both parties though the disagreement over the outlook in Iowa was the exception as consensus emerged about the rest of the Senate landscape.Democratic-held seats in South Dakota Montana and West Virginia are now expected by strategists in both parties to go to the Republicans.Each side also believes that Senator Jeanne Shaheen a Democrat will hang on in New Hampshire. Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina has a slight edge but the race has now become one of the closest in the country.Republicans are most optimistic — and Democrats most concerned — about their chances in Colorado and Arkansas where Democrats Mark Udall and Mark Pryor respectively are seeking re-election.Both sides generally agreed that Senator Mark Begich Democrat of Alaska is in some danger but polling is unpredictable enough in the sprawling state that neither party was supremely confident about the outcome.Of the Republican-held seats both parties think the member in most danger is Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas who is locked in a difficult race with Greg Orman an Independent.If that happens and Mr. Orman caucuses with Democrats it would mean that Republicans would need to pick up seven seats to win the 51 they would need to take control of the Senate. (If it is 50-50 the Democrats would retain the edge thanks to the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.)The Kansas race could raises the stakes in the two Southern states that both require candidates to receive more than 50 percent of the vote to win outright on Election Day.Both sides are preparing for runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana which could turn on a variety of factors including whether the races are for control of the Senate.Democrats worry about the prospect of a separate gubernatorial runoff in Georgia in December a month before the Senate runoff and the challenge of turning out voters three times in three months. That is why they poured so much money into the state in the last week: A win outright on Election Day by Michelle Nunn the Democratic nominee could represent their 50th vote.
 9,In his first time at bat against Darwin Strawberry led off the second inning with a single to left. He raced to third as Johnson singled to right and he scored on Gary Carter's fly to left.The third time he went to the plate in the fifth inning Strawberry tripled and triggered a three-run burst. He scored on Johnson's sacrifice fly and Bobby Ojeda later singled home two runs after Magadan stroked his third single and Kevin Elster doubled.Having hit a single a home run and a triple in his first three tries Strawberry had a chance to become only the fifth player in Mets' history to hit for the cycle. (No he said if he had hit another home run he would not have stopped at second.) No Double for Strawberry However he never got the double. He grounded to second in the sixth inning and was walked in the eighth after McReynolds doubled Dykstra home and Wally Backman to third. McReynolds had hit a home run in the sixth.The 12-run 16-hit attack was enough to give Ojeda only his second victory in his last eight starts. Ojeda's performance though was mixed. The left-hander held the Astros without a hit until two were out in the fifth inning but in the eighth inning he was unable to maintain a six-run lead and required relief.The Astros actually scored their first run without a hit. With the Mets ahead 4-0 and one out in the fifth Ojeda walked Henderson. Craig Biggio the Astros' rookie catcher from Seton Hall then hit a grounder to third base and Howard Johnson trying for a force at second threw the ball into right field.Henderson went to third on the error and scored on Darwin's fly to right. It was then that the Astros got their first hit. Billy Hatcher rapped a double to center field and Biggio scored the second run. Trouble for OjedaA hit by Hatcher caused trouble for Ojeda in the eighth inning too. It was a leadoff single and Rafael Ramirez followed with a double to right. Ojeda struck out Bill Doran and retired Glenn Davis on a soft liner to second but Kevin Bass lined a hard single to center driving in both runners and reducing the Mets' lead to 8-4.After Ojeda walked Buddy Bell Manager Johnson summoned Terry Leach and he ended the rally by getting Terry Puhl a pinch-hitter on a line drive to short.

 9,Will it be Simms or Hostetler?That was the question that broke the silence broke the ice and ever so slightly broke up Bruce Coslet at training camp today. With the first exhibition game against Philadelphia just three days away the Jets' head coach has other things on his mind than answering the quarterback question of the Super Bowl champion Giants. He even has a sizable quarterback quandary of his own."I hope to play all the quarterbacks" said Coslet who has already indicated that last year's starter Ken O'Brien will get the start against the Eagles."If that works out fine" said Coslet. "If not don't read too much into it because we're going to try to win the game. Our first priority always is to win the game. We want to see some young defensive players. We saw them in a scrimmage situation. Now we want to see them in a game."The Jets lost a controlled scrimmage to the Washington Redskins 25-16 last Saturday at Lehigh University in Bethlehem Pa. as Coslet got a good look at his quarterbacks in 7-on-7 passing drills against no rush and 11-on-11 against a weak pass rush.

 0,Hormone therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk for dementia a new study has found.Androgen deprivation therapy or A.D.T. is used to treat prostate cancer of varying degrees of severity. It can significantly reduce the risk for cancer progression and death.The study in JAMA Network Open included 154089 men whose average age was 74 and who had diagnoses of prostate cancer. Of these 62330 received A.D.T. and the rest did not.In an average follow-up of eight years the scientists found that compared with men who had no hormone therapy one to four doses of A.D.T. was associated with a 19 percent increased risk for both Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia and the risk increased with the number of doses. At five to eight doses the increased risk was 28 percent for Alzheimer’s and 24 percent for other dementias.

 9,Now that the auto makers are in that box Mr. Bieber clearly relishes keeping them there insisting that they sell all 60000 and create all 15000 new jobs. "By God I'll tell you this we're going to keep tabs of how many are sold there and we're going to remind people of this" he said. Parts Supplier MovementsWhile he does not expect the auto makers to move assembly plants to Mexico overnight Mr. Bieber said he thought they would begin pushing their parts suppliers to relocate there in pursuit of lower-cost labor.In a recent interview at Solidarity House the U.A.W.'s headquarters here Mr. Bieber reflected both on his recent defeat on the trade agreement and on what most auto analysts regard as his recent victory over the Big Three in national labor contract negotiations. As he spoke about the future of labor and of his union -- whose diverse but declining membership includes not only auto workers but state employees and jai alai players -- he adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Mr. Clinton whose support he acknowledged he needs to fulfill a broad legislative agenda."I have great respect" Mr. Bieber allowed with the faintest of grins "for his ability to get people to vote his way."Indeed Mr. Bieber has not taken the big picture of him with Mr. Clinton off his office wall despite the irony that the President's scribble has acquired since the trade agreement vote: "with thanks for all your help.""We worked hard in 1992 to help elect Bill Clinton President of the United States" Mr. Bieber said. "I have no regrets." Fourth and Final Term at U.A.W.At 65 Mr. Bieber a hulking man and a tenacious bargainer is serving his fourth and final term as U.A.W. president. He will retire in 1995 ending a career with the U.A.W. that began in 1949.

 9,In Robbins v. California he said: ''It is often forgotten that nothing in the Fourth Amendment itself requires that searches be conducted pursuant to warrants.'' The Chief Justice seems to have sanitized the language of the Fourth Amendment by asking us to forget that the ''right of persons to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.''In Mapp v. Ohio decided in 1961 the defendant was convicted of possession of obscene literature. Her conviction was based primarily on the introduction in evidence of supposedly lewd and lascivious books seized during an unlawful search of her home. At the trial no search warrant was produced by the prosecution. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of conviction holding that the rule excluding evidence unlawfully seized was ''an essential part of both the Fourth and 14th Amendments.'' This is the exclusionary rule criticized by Justice Rehnquist.Now we are told ''what a person knowingly exposes to the public even in his home or office is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection'' (quoting Smith v. Maryland 1979) even the intimate details and habits of the life he or she leads in the home.It is no wonder that Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in dissent ''that members of our society will be shocked to learn that the Court the ultimate guarantor of liberty deems unreasonable our expectation that the aspects of our private lives that are concealed safely in a trash bag will not become public.'' He also stated ''Scrutiny of another's trash is contrary to commonly accepted notions of civilized behavior.''Finally Justice White writing for the majority failed to note that an Orange County ordinance required the respondents to ''remove from their premises at least once a week all solid waste created produced or accumulated in or about his dwelling house.'' Accordingly respondent Greenwood cannot be said to have voluntarily placed his trash in an area accessible to the public. He had no choice and was merely acting in compliance with a county ordinance. He was held to have surrendered his subjective expectation of privacy but not in a manner society accepts as objectively reasonable. Society would not accept the proposition that a person merely by placing a letter or book in a mailbox for pickup by the postal carrier has surrendered reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of either. In 1789 James Madison wrote in ''Annals of Congress'' (Volume One page 439) that ''independent tribunals of justice will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights'' (Amendments One through 10 ratified in 1791). Now almost 200 years later the Supreme Court of the United States has indeed encroached upon rights expressly granted in the Fourth Amendment by trashing our privacy. WILLIAM M. BRINTON San Francisco May 18 1988
 0,“We feel this is a significant day in Buffalo Bills history.” — Russ Brandon the Bills’ chief operating officer.Brandon was speaking at a news conference Saturday to introduce the two newest members of Buffalo’s revamped defense defensive tackles Marcus Stroud and Spencer Johnson. In the first two days of the free-agent signing period the Bills have been among the most active teams in an attempt to improve a defense that ranked 31st in the N.F.L. last season. On Friday Buffalo added linebacker Kawika Mitchell a former Giant.“It was unanimous that Josh Brown was the top free agent at any position available.” — Rams Coach Scott Linehan.Yes Linehan is talking about kicker Josh Brown. This coming from the coach of a team whose offensive line last season was decimated allowing 48 sacks and a bevy of quarterback injuries. The Rams apparently made an offer to guard Alan Faneca but Brown was in their sights after Jeff Wilkins retired Friday. Brown agreed to a five-year $14.2 million contract to move from one N.F.C. West team to another.Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren was not pleased last year when receiver Darrell Jackson was traded to a division opponent and he can’t be too happy to see Brown go to a rival too. Brown was considered so valuable that Seattle used its franchise-tag on him last year. He was expected to be a top priority for the Seahawks to re-sign and although they reportedly offered him $14 million Brown said Saturday that the offer was backloaded.”I was kind of nervous about another team in the division and I was like ‘I’m going to get massacred by the Seattle fans now.’ But it’s all part of the game.” — Josh Brown.Brown was not the only free agent to change teams but not divisions. After being cut by the Rams with whom he had spent his entire career Isaac Bruce signed with the San Francisco 49ers who have hired Bruce’s former coach Mike Martz as their offensive coordinator. Bernard Berrian decided to trade an unsettled quarterback situation for a slightly less unsettled one moving to the Vikings from the Bears. The Buccaneers signed Jeff Faine away from the Saints making him the highest-paid center in the N.F.L.
 0,DINNER with entertainment often used to mean dinner theater but the days of dinner theater in Connecticut seem to have faded into yesteryear along with veal cordon bleu and baked Alaska.That doesn't mean you have to dine in silence or to a repertory of golden oldies played off-key on an out-of-tune piano. These days you can find some very hot live music and entertainment all around the state in both fancy and funky settings that also feature interesting food. Here are a few of some of the livelier spots listed alphabetically by town.BridgeportDowntown Cabaret Theater may be the last outpost of what used to be known as dinner theater -- with a twist. Maybe it has survived because of its novel approach to dining called B.Y.O.D. Bring Your Own Dinner (and drinks). It works surprisingly well. Some patrons arrive with pizza and beer others favor more elaborate menus and a few have gone so far as to bring their own tablecloths china and silverware.The drill we found was to arrive early (in order to get the choice seats facing the stage at our reserved table which is shared with others) and unwrap and munch on our home-made sandwiches pasta salad and cookies. While we opted for the casual we noticed diners at another table with a large casserole salad bowl foil-wrapped warm rolls meringue pie and 1920's-style cocktail shaker of martinis. Most tables seat 8 though there are a few for 2 and one for 10 diners. Soft drinks tea and coffee are the only drinks sold on the premises.
 0,Roland Lewis the president and chief executive of the Waterfront Alliance answered City Room readers’ questions this week about land use environmental concerns and preservation of New York and New Jersey’s waterways and harbors. Following is his third and final set of responses. We are no longer accepting questions on this feature.Why is there no official waterfront access for the entire southern coast of the South Bronx? It is the longest stretch of land with no riverfront access. What is M.W.A. doing about it and who else is working on this important issue of equity?— Posted by PabloYou are correct that the southern coast of the Bronx is sorely lacking in waterfront access. A start was made with Barreto Street Park and the Hunts Point Riverside Park but there are literally miles of shorefront that could have access points. In terms of waterfront access the new park at Yankee Stadium also leaves much to be desired. There are great organizations in the Bronx that are working to fix this including Sustainable South Bronx the Point and the Bronx River Alliance. The Waterfront Alliance is working with Borough President Carrion’s office and the New York State Department of State to identify and promote waterfront access points in the South Bronx.I am concerned about the loss of the Todd Shipyard graving dock that was filled for Ikea’s parking lot in Red Hook. Especially when the city just came out with a report saying we need more graving docks in order for our maritime industry to stay competitive. Why do we need ship repair facilities? What’s special about the Erie Basin and Brooklyn waterfront in Red Hook?— Posted by LisaThe loss of the Todd Shipyard to an Ikea parking lot was a tough blow to the maritime industry in New York. In hindsight that decision was particularly disappointing as New York’s Economic Development Corporation’s Maritime Location Study conducted by SUNY Maritime recently concluded that New York City needs eight more ship repair facilities to handle the backlog for this growing industry. Red Hook with its deep water is ideally suited for the maritime industry and across the Erie Basin from Ikea the Erie Basin bargeport hums with activity with tugs and barges coming and going.The Red Hook story is still unfolding. On either side of the Swedish furniture store are now vacant lots one of them was once home to the Revere sugar factory. Will the city follow the prescription in its own report and use this critically needed space for maritime activity or are we sliding down the commercial retail slippery slope with Home Depot Bed Bath and Beyond and their ilk taking up this waterfront space? Ikea itself could help the maritime cause. The store controls two piers that could be used by companies like Hughes Marine to relieve its overcrowded operation in Erie Basin. Also Ikea while it was in development said that it would consider shipping in its goods by barge. What a green and progressive waterfront stroke that would be.And finally the Todd Shipyard is buried but not gone. This valuable piece of maritime infrastructure (worth hundreds of millions of dollars if built today) could someday be excavated and put back to work. The Red Hook story is far from over. Stay tuned and get involved.I understand that boat and ship motors are not very efficient and are not regulated in any degree as cars are. Do you think increased ferries and other commercial motorboats small and large will increase air and noise pollution on the water? Can New York City enforce its own regulations for boat motor emissions?— Posted by StacyGetting people on ferries and goods and recyclables on barges will get cars and trucks off of our roads which would help to clean our air. But if we do not work to clean up the engines that power these vessels we are replacing one problem with another. M.W.A. urges the use of use clean fuels on the water. The City of New York has gotten the ball rolling by mandating the use of lower sulfur diesel fuel on the Staten Island Ferry beginning in 2008. Legislation has also been introduced in the New York City Council that would mandate cleaner fuels for all ferries. Finally bulk purchase of low sulfur diesel or biofuel would help lower the cost for smaller operators.Any idea what’s planned for re-use of the West 135th Street marine transfer station — which is not slated for use under the city’s solid waste management plan? Is there a planning process under way?— Posted by KendallThe use for the West 135th Street Marine Transfer Station is still not determined. WEACT the Harlem based environmental justice organization is working closely with the City and other community leaders is organizing a community-based charrette process that would work to find the best possible reuse for the transfer station.I was wondering what is in store for those rusty ancient piers along the Hudson around 63rd Street (and maybe a brief history of what they originally were used for). I know that Donald Trump apparently ripped one down and it seemed as if he got his hands on half of the others before someone was able to stop him. Are those remaining structures going to be protected or does it seem he will eventually be able to get rid of them to complete his little Battery Park North? At this point they are really natural sculptures and a great reminder that not all of this city’s past can be bought and turned into a suburb. Is there hope?— Posted by ZacI’m with Zac — I also worry about any possible plans for removal of the old piers in river near the West 60s. Please tell me they’re going to stay!— Posted by KatieThose old rusty structures are now commonly known as the “Spaghetti Pier.” Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe and many other appreciators of fine accidental art lobbied to keep them and they have been saved at least for the time being as a science experiment as the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation and the city’s Parks Department are using them to determine the effect of shading on Hudson River fish. I hope the study is very thorough and the Spaghetti Piers stay up for a good long time.I know there was a huge fire in Greenpoint that destroyed most of the neighborhood. But I hope that a commemorative park and small museum is established on the East River’s edge to preserve the Monitor’s special piece of history! The site also as I remember had a wonderful view of the New York City’s wonderful skyline.If my Dad was alive he would have been very sad to see that the World Trade Center towers were destroyed. He had worked on the very precarious top of those buildings installing water lines and air-conditioning equipment. It had been very dangerous work — he was so proud of his effort! We could actually see the towers from the top floor of our Oak Street home. Well at least my family has its unforgettable memories. Let’s hope the Monitor historic site will be restored to the East River water’s edge. I’m sure there are many others who lived in the area that would like to see it preserved too.— Posted by Kathy KiernanThank you for your reminiscence about Greenpoint. The group you should look up and get involved with is the Greenpoint Monitor Museum. The museum does not yet have a home but does not lack for enthusiasts and it would probably welcome a native daughter to lend a hand. When this museum is created it will be a welcome addition to the North Brooklyn waterfront as a well as valuable educational resource about our nation’s history.How will the Governors Island’s waterfront be handled? The simpler least commercial the better.— Posted by dm10003Many people call Governors Island “the Central Park of the Waterfront.” Its future has yet to be decided. Great progress has been made in providing access and fun programming on the island — and most recently in establishing a world-class park. A design team was selected for a 40-acre park on the southern half of the island on the island and design work and some demolition is now under way. The island also contains two historic forts run by the National Park Service. The open question is what will be the programming and use for the dozens of historic buildings on the northern two-thirds of the island. You can keep up to date about news and events on the island by visiting the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation and the Governors Island Alliance. But most of all if you have not made the trip please do. Especially now before the commercial use of the island is settled on — it is a remarkable oasis in the middle of our harbor.My question is: given the recession New York State is facing what impact will the budget cuts both at a city and state level will have on the development and preservation of the waterfront? How can citizens situated at various levels and with a wide range of professional training do pro bono work and assist in the wonderful work already in progress? How can we partner up to make this happen?— Posted by Angelica AquinoWe are entering tough economic times and many of the waterfront efforts will be delayed or possibly even threatened. Your instinct to lend a hand would be welcome by many of the Waterfront Alliance partners. Visit our list of partners at our site and shop around for a waterfront organization that interests you and go volunteer. The economic cycles will come and go but the mission driven work to transform our waterfront by the many alliance partners will persevere and your support will be welcome.Are there plans and a time line to connect the Upper East Side greenway with the Harlem River Esplanade? It is one of the major missing pieces in making the Manhattan Greenway possible. Currently bridge repair has taken acres of waterfront land from 125th Street to 135th Street — a 10-block detour. Then after the Harlem River Esplanade ends at 142nd Street a bicyclist or pedestrian must detour for another 10-13 blocks until the greenway begins again at 156th Street.Unfortunately because of its isolation the Harlem River Esplanade is an area full of gangs drug use and homeless people. By connecting it north and south it will be used and patrolled more and would greatly improve the area.— Posted by Harlem EsplanadeThere are plans but unfortunately they have been put on hold for as long as eight years as the Department of Transportation has taken over this stretch of the waterfront as a staging area for the rebuilding of the Harlem River Drive. One bright spot is the stretch between 139th Street and 142nd Street — where the M.W.A. is in partnership with community partners like as the Harlem River Park Task Force and the city’s Departments of Parks and Recreation — have redesigned the edge of this waterfront. The concrete bulkhead is being replaced with a variegated shoreline that will include a sitting are that could serve as an outdoor classroom tidal pools and a pilot project oyster bed. It will be environmental and accessible. It opens this fall. Check it out.* * *More than the number of questions from so many City Room readers this week the passion and intelligence of your queries and comments impressed me. It is our waterfront. Please be sure politicians government officials and policymakers remember that and keep thinking writing and working to create the world-class waterfront we all deserve.

 9,To Sir Colin a medium-sized man with light brown hair and an easy jocular mannner the fact that the Federal agency has set a deadline for comment bodes well since Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card can then make a decision.Mr. Card has said he will decide before President-elect Bill Clinton takes office. He has also said there are strong reasons to allow the investment.For one he and others say it would strenghten USAir financially and help secure the jobs of 47000 American workers. It would also send a strong signal that the United States welcomes foreign investment in domestic companies.On the other hand Mr. Card has also pushed the British hard in talks to let American carriers have similar rights to invest in British carriers. He has also sought what are called beyond rights or the ability of American carriers to fly beyond major hubs like London.All four major United States carriers have said that they will go along with the British Airways investment in USAir if they get reciprocal rights. Sir Colin argues that his airline's deal should not be linked to granting United States carriers more rights in Britain. He said the proposal conformed to American laws and should be decided on its merits.Once the deal is made he argues Britain is prepared to negotiate a much greater liberalization over the next year a process that will take time since Congress and the Clinton Administration would have to approve the new terms. Negotiators' StanceBut negotiators for the American side say that such a strategy would mean giving up their most valuable chip and that they would have to rely on the good will of the British to open their market.

 9,Barry Bonnell ran for Burroughs maneuver made by Tom Burgess the acting manager to give the Braves more speed. Bobby Cox had been dismissed for some abusive words from the bench while the Mets were batting in the fifth. Nick Colosi the plate umpire tossed Cox out.With Bonnell on first Lockwood committed a balk the fourth one called by the second‐base umpire Joe West. With Bonnell on second Biff Pocoroba sliced a double to right for the run. Lockwood got out of the inning without further scoring.Although the Mets had 11 hits off four pitchers they left 13 men on base. The Braves made better use of their scoring opportunities leaving only six men stranded on the same number of hits.“We had a bunch of chances” was all Manager Joe Torre could say after the game.The Braves had protested vigorously when Joel Youngblood threw out Burroughs at first for the second out in the fourth. Actually Youngblood's throw pulled Willie Montanez off ‘first base—or so it seemed to the 5399 fans who booed Satch Davidson”s call. It was Cox's jawing that finally got under Colosi's skin so he gave the Atlanta manager the restof the night off.The balk calls led to Met runs in the first against Preston Hanna Atlanta's starting pitcher and in the sixth against Adrian Devine the third Braves pitcher. Devine balked Boisclair to second wild pitched Boiselair to third and then balked him home with New York'Is final run. Montanez on base with an intentional walk moved to second on the same balk.
 0,EVERYONE seems worried about an exodus of high-skill jobs from the United States to third-world countries. But those fears are probably misplaced.While some such jobs are moving overseas the American economy will generate many more at home. And a lot of the jobs that go overseas will be more in the nature of 4 a.m. technical support for personal computers. Americans benefit from that too. The savings from that phone center in India are built into your new $350 PC.There is no great shortage of jobs in this country anyway. Unemployment is at a level that a generation ago would have been considered hard to achieve without significant inflation. Immigrants continue to pour in and to find work. Well-educated Americans will do just fine; foreigners are so confident in our economy that it is the beneficiary of huge capital inflows.Indeed the real threat to the American economy is not competition from successful foreign lands but the enormous drag imposed by countries that cannot produce the kind of strong consistent growth required for global prosperity. A world that depended for so long on American military power for political security now depends on American consumer spending for economic security and I suspect that this new dependence will prove just as troublesome. Over the long run it's probably not sustainable.
 9,Nancy Reagan opened a conference on drug abuse today by saying that any user of illicit drugs is an ''accomplice to murder.''Using unusually harsh language Mrs. Reagan set the tone of the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America by insisting that the key to eradicating drug use was to reduce demand not supply.''We must be absolutely unyielding and inflexible in our opposition to drug use'' said Mrs. Reagan who has made the drug issue one of her major causes. ''There is no middle ground. We must be as adamant about the casual user as we are about the addict.''Mrs. Reagan also announced that a treatment facility for young drug users the Nancy Reagan Center would be opened in Southern California after she and President Reagan left the White House. ''You can't get rid of me'' she told the audience gathered at a Washington hotel. 'Beginning to Win'

 0,“I found my peace when I decided to never kill again” Eastman said.And thus was the new Morgan explained his new code for survival solidified when his most coldblooded murder literally came back to haunt him giving his sensei a mortal nibble. As death descended Eastman handed over his lucky rabbit foot the one we saw in the Season 5 finale and gave a final piece of advice that sent Morgan on the quest back to Rick and friends. “You could stay here but you shouldn’t stay here” he said. “Everything is about people; everything in this life that is worth a damn.”And therein as another sage storyteller once put it lies the rub. Because not-killing in the name of preserving your own inner peace is great for you and your adversary but less so for the people who might encounter that adversary later. The Wolves Morgan declined to kill last season including the one he lectured on Sunday later took out others and eventually attacked the Alexandrians who were feeding and sheltering Morgan. At least one of the Wolves he turned loose in Episode 2 appeared to attack Rick last week.Inner peace is great but preserving it in such a way that jeopardizes the people who both sustain and depend on you is ultimately an act of selfishness. If you let me go Morgan’s captive told him after his story “I’m going to have to kill you Morgan — I’m going to have to kill everyone” children included. “Those are the rules” he said. “That’s my code.” So chew on that Morgan-san.That’s the problem with codes: They work in isolation but get trickier when they bump up against one another. For all the objective nobility of Morgan’s decision about how to exist in the world it doesn’t really answer the question about what he owes everyone else and how best to satisfy those obligations. That’s a riddle that he and nearly everyone else on this show whether it’s Rick’s ruling with an iron fist or Glenn’s encouraging others at his own peril have yet to solve.A Few Thoughts While We Put Our Feet Up• Glenn Watch: No answers this week not that I expected them. And not that I’m complaining either. I’m not sure Sunday’s episode needed to be 90 minutes long. (Does any TV show need to be 90 minutes long which seems to happen more and more these days?) But I do think after the pace of the first three we all could use a little break. (Update: Commenters and others point out that Steven Yeun was left out of the opening credits.)• Enjoyed the flaming walker who emerged from Morgan’s fire in the early part of the episode. Seems like you could weaponize those things right? Light them and direct them into a rival camp? I suppose it doesn’t show much regard for one’s opponent but it would be fun to watch.
 9,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will introduce on Monday a microprocessor chip that incorporates almost all of the components of the circuit board used in the original PC-AT personal computer.The announcement is the first of several expected in the coming months of superchips that are expected to allow notebook-size personal computers to shrink even further.In early personal computers the microprocessor which serves as the brain was surrounded by dozens of other chips that performed ancillary functions like helping the microprocessor interact with other parts of the computer. In recent years companies led by Chips and Technologies Inc. have developed so-called chip sets which consolidate these functions into a handful of chips.But as the number of transistors that can be put on a single piece of silicon continues to grow it is becoming possible to build the ancillary functions into the microprocessor itself. Advanced Micro's new chip contains all the electronics for a personal computer except the memory and a few specialized chips like one for drawing images on the screen.

 9,To the Editor:In her review of ''The Loony-Bin Trip'' Rosemary Dinnage asks ''Should not . . . psychiatric staff take antipsychotic medication for a time as part of their training in order to know what it feels like?'' No. The reason is that ''what it feels like'' differs depending upon the state of mind of the subject at the time. Given to a patient already depressed these antipsychosis medications intensify the experience of anguish and distress. Given to someone in a normal state of mind the drug creates a distressing sense of enervation. Given to the acute psychotic however it provides a very welcome relief.Most manics no matter how bad their judgment is resist taking medication that threatens to take away their mania. They enjoy the mania in the same way that individuals who are high on cocaine enjoy their high and do not willingly give it up. Both will come for treatment only when they have crashed into depression.As characterized by Ms. Dinnage Kate Millett's argument is not correct: mania is not creative. Hypomania that is a state of exhilaration in which judgment is not seriously impaired can be extremely creative. Because of the impairment of judgment that accompanies it mania is disruptive and destructive though it is not recognized as such until the individual recovers from it.MORTIMER OSTOW M.D.Bronx

 0,Fremon ended his affair with the unknown woman and rented a cottage at the Haymarket Gardens a verdant recreational park that Major John Pryor owned on the banks of the James River. A prominent Revolutionary War veteran who had fought under George Washington Pryor was a wealthy Richmond businessman proprietor of the largest livery stable in the capital and secretary of the influential Jockey Club. The repulsively vulgar seventy-five-year-old was notorious not only for his shady horse racing ventures but also for his arresting thirty-year-old wife. The improbable match was a classically tawdry tale of decayed southern gentry and social expediency. Charles Fremon's emergence as Anne Pryor's French teacher would only add to the drama.Anne Beverley Whiting was the youngest of fifteen children. Her father Colonel Thomas Whiting a Virginia landholder who had been a leading member of the House of Burgesses had been the king's attorney before the American Revolution. President of the Naval Board during the Revolution-a most dignified position-Whiting's lineage traced a connection through marriage to George Washington whom he had held as an infant during the future president's baptism. His Elmington estate encompassed all the acreage in Gloucester County between the North and Ware rivers. It was to his third wife Elizabeth Sewall that Anne was born.Whiting died when Anne was six months old. His estate was divided equally among his surviving children each of whom also received "thirty negroes" according to his will. As a baby Anne was powerless to protect her inheritance and when her mother married Samuel Carey Anne's fortune dwindled as Carey directed the family's finances. The five children from Whiting's first marriage engaged in protracted and apparently unsuccessful litigation against Carey in an effort to acquire control of the bequests. With the death of her mother the orphaned Anne found the Carey home intolerable-"disagreeable from the vexations of lawsuits"-and moved in with her married sister Catherine.By age seventeen Anne had blossomed into a graceful belle and Catherine avidly sought a suitable mate for the dispossessed girl. She settled on John Pryor as Anne's deliverer from what one observer called "the greatest of all calamities poverty." Anne was repulsed by the gouty and crude man forty-five years her senior and rebuffed his pursuit despite her sister's ardent efforts. Finally she relented apparently entering the marriage in 1796 with stoic resignation. Her dowry included "the negroes contained in lot No. 3"-three men two women and two children who apparently constituted what was left of her inheritance.From the start the arrangement was problematic he a cantankerous and impotent elderly man-"a disabled stiff-limbed old soldier" the Richmond Dispatch later portrayed him-she increasingly desperate in the loveless childless union. Her bride's nest was a modest rambling structure on the grounds of Haymarket Gardens consisting of two long wings and attached servants' quarters. "I was married too young to be sensible of the importance of the state in which I was about to enter" Anne wrote afterward "and found when too late that I had acted with too much precipitancy and could never feel that love for him to whom I was united without which the marriage state of all others is the most wretched."For twelve years she suffered in silence eventually refusing to join Pryor in the fast-paced horsy set that was her husband's milieu and slipping steadily into what was then called melancholia-the nineteenth-century euphemism for depression. Not until the stunningly handsome and wildly romantic Jean Fremon came to Richmond in 1810-taking up lodging on Pryor's estate-did Anne feel the stirrings of love for the first time in her life. Hired by Pryor to teach French to Anne Fremon lured her smoothly into an affair. Though as discreet as possible their mutual arousal was impossible to hide especially for the Byronic Fremon. They planned to wait for Pryor to die-then Anne would inherit his abundant holdings and the two would be free to marry-but their designs were preempted when her husband learned of the illicit liaison.The hot-tempered Pryor confronted the two lovers on July 9 1811 threatening first to kill Anne. "You may spare yourself the crime" she railed at him. "I shall leave your house tomorrow morning forever!" The two men exchanged threats each vowing to kill the other but by dawn the next day Anne and Charles had left Richmond. "I did not run away but was turned out of doors at night and in an approaching storm" Anne later claimed. Anne "totally alienated her affections from me by the vile and invidious machinations of an execrable monster of baseness and depravity with whom I have recently discovered she has for some time past indulged in criminal intercourse" Pryor declared in his divorce petition published in the Virginia Patriot.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.On the eve of the War of 1812 Richmond was a flourishing community of some seven thousand what historian Jay Winik described as "a thriving hybrid of old-fashioned Southern gentility and newfangled urban enterprise." Such a city was primed to find interest in the couple's scurrilous conduct and the scandal was rich fodder for gossip among Richmond's patrician society. But Anne and Charles embarked on their own adventure apparently following Fremon's long-standing and mysterious interest in the character and condition of North American Indians touring the Indian regions of the southeastern United States. Combining their assets they loaded their belongings onto a stagecoach and along with two of her slaves set out for Williamsburg and then Norfolk where Anne would collect additional possessions in those towns-property Anne had apparently been granted the previous year as a result of litigation against her father's estate.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyFamily lore would have it that they had enough money between them to "gratify Fremon's wish to tour the South and learn something of the habits of the Indians in which he felt a keen interest." His unexplained anthropological curiosity about American Indians is said to have fostered an early attachment to the subject in his son John the legend of his ethnographic exploration evolving with John's future fame. Though the story was no doubt embellished by a succeeding generation the evidence suggests that the couple did indeed move from town to town often camping for extended periods with Native Americans.By October they were settled in a tiny brick house in Savannah Georgia on the property of one of that town's more prominent citizens. Located in what was then known as the Yamacraw section of the small city they set up housekeeping while awaiting her final divorce so they could marry. Their funds nearly exhausted Charles began advertising his services as a teacher of French and dancing instructor and Anne sought boarders to supplement their meager holdings. "We are poor" she wrote a friend at this time "but we can be content with little for I have found that happiness consists not in riches."The Virginia House of Delegates declined Pryor's divorce petition on December 11 1811 and when Anne's first child John Charles was born January 21 1813 the birth was possibly out of wedlock. Much would be made of John's illegitimacy later in his life-by both political rivals and psychological biographers-his future marred by "the dual heritage of scandal and the blunt label of bastard." Observers would attribute John's driving ambition remote personality and defiance of authority to this hapless beginning. Still his early family life was affectionate and stimulating-his nanny the bighearted "Black Hannah" inherited by his mother had accompanied the family from Richmond. Overall it was a time that he remembered with fondness despite its many hardships. "A child of love a child who knew the meaning of discrimination before he knew the word" wrote his biographer Ferol Egan "Frémont came from a background with all the trappings of a Charles Dickens novel."Shortly after John's birth the couple took to wandering again. John later recalled his first memories as those of Indian villages where his parents and their servants would tether their horses aromatic smoke permeating their campsite. In an ironic twist of fate the toddler narrowly escaped a bullet fired by his future father-in-law. In September 1813 the Fremons were temporarily lodged at a Nashville hotel-alternatively identified in historical accounts as the City Hotel and Clayton Talbot's Tavern-where Thomas Hart Benton and his brother Jesse also were guests. Then an up-and-coming lawyer and Tennessee politician Benton had come to Nashville to confront General Andrew Jackson who had acted as a second for Jesse Benton's rival in a recent duel. The town had poured out to greet Jackson celebrated for his role as a fighter of Indians and for his heroic march from Natchez to Nashville during the War of 1812. Undaunted by Jackson's fame and support Benton was determined to avenge what he considered Jackson's brutal treatment of Jesse. Such frontier violence was commonplace the days of Daniel Boone still fresh in the young nation's mind."The quarrel was an opera bouffe episode" according to historian Nevins Jackson widely proclaiming his intention to horsewhip Benton. But after a volley of gunshots and a series of physical blows it was Jackson who was carried away bleeding-the blood from the injury soaking two mattresses and leaving Jackson perilously close to death. The fracas left a minié ball from Jesse's pistol lodged in the future president's shoulder and another stray bullet meant for Jackson penetrated the thin wall of the hotel room where John was sleeping with his traveling parents. Out of the duel between Jackson and Benton grew a friendship and political alliance that would benefit them both-and fatefully John.The family would stay at least a year in Nashville where Anne gave birth to their daughter Elizabeth. They then moved back to Norfolk hoping to settle permanently. Now that Pryor had died Charles and Anne were free to marry-though there is no evidence that they ever did so-and the scandal that had surrounded their elopement had faded though it was never wholly forgotten. Anne had many family members in Norfolk. Charles's brother Francis also still lived there and the couple's third child a boy named Horation "Frank" Franciswould be born there in 1817.It had been seven of the happiest most adventurous and fun-loving years of her lifeAnne was by all accounts unconcerned about their improvident circumstances and passionately in love with her husband. But when Charles died suddenly that same year she was left in utter poverty a widow with three small children. Francis Fremon urged her to move to France with him. The recent accidental fatal shooting of Francis's sixteen-year-old son at a Fourth of July celebration had left him mourning and desirous of returning to his native land. There Francis assured Anne the Fremon clan would embrace her brood. But Anne felt herself an ingrained American and would not consider relocating.Instead she moved into quarters near the Dinwiddie Courthouse where John received his first formal instruction. Little is known of their time in Norfolk after Charles's death though Anne had now taken to calling herself "Mrs. Fremont" with the t. How she survived owning no property and at thirty-seven years old facing an unpredictable and precarious future can be attributed to her fortitude energy and devotion to her children. She would focus her hopes and dreams on her firstborn son and John would gallantly rise to the call. He adored his mother whom he saw as "a woman of most extraordinary grace and beauty of gentle captivating manners with a sweet but singularly melancholy disposition." From that early bond forged with a romantic and independent woman his own respect and admiration of women would be formed.In 1823 Anne now nearly destitute turned her sights several hundred miles down the coast to Charleston South Carolina determined as she was to rear her children in genteel surroundings while also offering them the opportunity that the bustling trade center might afford.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyExcerpted from Passion and Principle by Sally Denton Copyright © 2007 by Sally Denton.

 9,''Dance of Hope'' opens today at the Public Theater just 13 days before the Dec. 14 presidential and congressional elections in Chile the first since the military coup that overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens. The timing is not accidental.The film directed by Deborah Shaffer is a documentary about the Chilean opposition movement that eventually led to the 1988 plebiscite in which the vote went against continued military rule. In particular the movie documents the activities of a women's group calling itself the Association of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared.Like their counterparts in Argentina who fought the former military Government in that country the Chilean women are well organized and persistent supported in large part by their sorrow and anger. Eight women of different backgrounds tell their stories. Intercut with the interviews are harrowing shots of anti-Government demonstrations their suppression by the military and the women's efforts to finds the bodies of lost relatives in the desert wastes of northern Chile.The title of the film refers to the cueca the Chilean love dance usually performed by a man and a woman. To call attention to their loss the women in the film perform the dance without partners. The movie attends an Amnesty International concert held across the border in Argentina where Sting performs to publicize the Chilean women's cause.

 0,Japan's unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 5.1 percent in August as more people stopped looking for work the government statistics agency reported. The labor force fell by 310000 reflecting a labor market that is still stagnant but the jobless rate fell because those who stopped looking for work were not counted as unemployed. Another measure of the economy improved however as spending by households headed by a salaried worker grew 2.2 percent in August. The increase came largely as a result of a big decline in spending in July. Ken Belson (NYT)

 9,Stanford University reached the College World Series for the fifth time in seven years today. A 16-2 victory over Kentucky the second over the Wildcats in two days allowed the defending champion Cardinal to win the Northeast region of the national collegiate tournament and continue a tradition that is as challenging as it is happy.After winning the double-elimination tournament following an opening-game loss and after having to defeat the Wildcats twice with freshman starting pitchers the Cardinal players realize that the hard part has not yet begun.The College World Series starts Friday. And so do final examinations. ''I've got to take them home and try to figure out how we're going to take finals'' said Mark Marquess the Stanford coach. ''I want my seniors to graduate and the rest of the team to be back next fall.'' On the BrinkFour days ago the Cardinal (41-22) nearly avoided a conflict between the National Collegiate Athletic Association baseball calendar and the end of Stanford's academic quarter. Last Friday the Cardinal lost to St. John's and was tied with Fordham in the eighth inning.

 9,The tipoff came when the Bush people said the speech would be a "defining moment." That was what they had called the gulf war this time last year -- a "defining moment" -- and now they were recycling it to ballyhoo a speech.They didn't even have any new phrases for Pete's sake. How could they possibly have a new idea? Applying "defining moment" to that perennial brain-glazer the State of the Union speech should have told us how things stood: to wit that this outfit is so sure it's home safe for another four years that it doesn't even feel the need for fresh bluster much less a fresh thought.As if to flaunt his contentment with last year's crowd-grabbers the President addressed the economic recession with the same chilling words he used after Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait: "This will not stand."What does this mean? That the recession is going to get Schwarzkopfed unless it comes to its senses and clears out of America pronto? Of course not. It means "Prosperity is just around the corner."

Only as you reach the foot of the spacious lawn does Talavera reveal itself in all its faded elegance subject to the inroads of time but occupied in unbroken succession by the Van Ness and Philip families for nearly 200 years.Every fall some 2000 city dwellers and suburbanites make their way to the orchards around back where descendants of the original owners are making ends meet by running a pick-your-own-apple business. Apples cost $14 to $16 a bushel depending on the variety which includes McIntoshes Northern Spy Mutsu and Jonagolds. The family also sells heritage tomatoes and pears -- among them Anjou rare on the East Coast and Harrow Sweet.''My great-great-aunts would have died to see me in pants and down there taking money'' said Leila Philip 40 an English professor at Colgate University in Hamilton N.Y. ''But it's an important job that needs to be done. I enjoy the people and I feel it connects me to a long history.''The Philip family's once extensive land holdings in Columbia County -- 294 acres in 1732 -- have diminished to 125 acres. In 1992 when Ms. Philip's father John Van Ness Philip Jr. died it looked as though the family might lose the place forever. The cost of labor machinery and materials had risen drastically in recent years and apples could be raised more cheaply outside the United States.

 9,SATURDAY. SEPTEMBER 3 1977Malaysia's attitude to Vietnamese seeking refuge in the country has softened. American diplomats say this has followed President Carter's decision to admit 15000 refugees from Indochina and the offer of other Western countries to take some in. Thailand and especially Malaysia are not so fearful now that they will be permanently burdened. Malaysia no longer pushes the “boat people” back out to sea. Of the 8000 refugees in transit camps from Japan to Indochina 3000 are in Malaysia. Only Western nations have offered asylum to the wanderers. No Asian nation has acknowledged an obligation to give permanent asylum. [Page 1 Columns 2‐4.]•The latest British‐American proposals for a Rhodesian settlement are “mad” “crazy” and ‘insane” Prime Minister Ian D. Smith said in a television news conference in Salisbury. He stopped short of an outright rejection however and said that his Government would give the proposals serious consideration before responding possibly with Counterproposals. [3:6.]•Rumania's human rights movement appears to have been crushed completely. President Nicolae Ceausescu has succeeded in eliminating visible dissent with comparatively little punitive action. Paul Goma the novelist who was the movement's leader has been silenced as have been hundreds of others who only five months ago were signing petitions appealing for support from International organizations and even staging modest demonstrations. Mr. Goma has been put to work in the National Library in Bucharest and he and his famliy have been given a new apartment but no telephone. [3:1‐2.]A rise in the unemployment rate in August of two‐tenths of a percentage point to 7.1 percent of the total labor force was reported by the Labor Department. Almost all of the increase the department said was concentrated among blacks. Civil rights leaders asserted that the new figures confirmed charges made by black leaders that the Administration had neglected blacks the poor and the cities. [1:6.]
 9,Much of the time Room 3-223 is a fairly harmonious place. Simone Rivera 9 said she felt comfortable enough in class to answer honestly when another girl Caroline Sepulveda asked her if she had both a mother and father at home. ''I said 'No' '' Simone recalled the other night her mother at her side. ''She said 'Why?' So I told her 'Because my mom is gay.' ''And Hillary Fertig the class's 23-year-old student teacher who attended only Jewish day schools and yeshivas until age 18 said she was greeted enthusiastically when she asked several black students to teach her the rap song they were singing. ''I said 'I'm white. Do you think I can sing it the same way as you?' '' Ms. Fertig recalled. ''They said 'Of course.' ''But sometimes the students demonstrate flashes of intolerance.Ms. Fertig said that she once watched a Hispanic girl snatch a book from a classmate saying ''You can't touch it because you're black.'' Jyoti Sharma who has picked up many of the vocal cadences of her parents' native India said a classmate had derided her accent as ''weird.''And Seiji Iino said a boy had called him a ''nigger'' in the lunchroom. ''He doesn't even know what it means'' concluded Seiji whose family is from Japan and Austria.Other students say they have been taunted not because of their race but for other perceived weaknesses.

 9,To the Editor:The writer of your article on New York City's West 57th Street ("A T-Shirt for Every Theme" Nov. 24) seems to have walked up and down the street with blinders on until the lights became garish enough to see. Too late.He writes that West 57th Street was "pale" in comparison to Fifth and Park avenues Broadway and the Bowery. Fifty-seventh Street has always been one of the cultural centers of Manhattan: a magnificent street of width beauty and elegance.Regrettably only Hollywood's and New York City's current catering to tinsel taste awoke him. But this new streetscape is a sad testament to the city's continuing slide into a theme park mentality (42d Street being another case in point).Long before the likes of Planet Hollywood and the Brooklyn Diner were dropped on 57th Street that thoroughfare was home to a marvelous juxtaposition of eclectic architecture and companionable commerce: most of the finest art galleries in the city; the Art Students League (housed in a beautiful building); the wonderful old Automat; the Russian Tea Room in all its glory and the jewel in the crown Carnegie Hall. It was a street in the true understated European tradition. All this in the short space from Avenue of the Americas to Broadway alone.
 9,'Didn't Do It for Love'Directed by Monika TreutNot rated; 82 minutesOne thing you can say about Eva Norvind the flamboyant subject of Monika Treut's documentary film ''Didn't Do It for Love'' is that she has never stayed in one mode for very long. When she was still a teen-ager in the early 1960's the Norwegian-born actress took a bus from New York to Mexico with only $10 in her pocket. She quickly established herself as a blond buxom star in a series of Mexican B-movies and worked as a prostitute whose clients included a number of prominent Mexican politicians. Later she participated in a scheme to smuggle television sets into the country.After appearing on Mexican television advising women about birth control and creating a scandal by exhibiting herself on the streets in a bikini Ms. Norvind was officially deported from the country (but remained secretly) and had an illegitimate daughter.Moving to New York City after winning a scholarship to study film at New York University Ms. Norvind established a raffish literary salon of sorts and under the name Ava Taurel became a professional dominatrix administering punishment and humilation to a mostly male clientele (many of her clients were lawyers she recalls) at $300 an hour. As business boomed she began teaching workshops in dominance and submission and appeared on television talk shows.All this frenetic change is more than one modest 80-minute movie can comfortably encapsulate. The person shown in the film clips of Ms. Norvind when she was a Mexican movie star bears hardly any physical resemblance to the severe gray- haired woman of today who in the movie's black-and-white film clips of her practicing her sadomasochistic trade fits the 1940's movie stereotype of a menacing prison matron.
 0,It is a magical sight: most mornings at dawn two hot-air balloons bearing tourists rise up and float silently above this ancient city of Buddhist temples and pagodas. After dodging and weaving for an hour through soft breezes they set down on a parched riverbed.Children from a nearby village gather to gape as the British pilots deflate the balloons and pop bottles of Champagne for the passengers. Rough travel this is not.It is precisely the kind of tourism deplored by democracy advocates inside and outside Myanmar. They say that travelers should not visit this country once called Burma because tourism dollars help underwrite its repressive military government. If people insist on going the critics say they should at least avoid plush hotels and sightseeing activities.Sipping Champagne after a recent flight some passengers explained their decision to make the trip.''I worried about political correctness prior to visiting Myanmar but now I feel it is politically incorrect not to visit'' said Helen Hasenfeld an administrator at the California Institute of Technology.

 9,The seven-year-old Wilkinson's Seafood Cafe needs more publicity about as much as lobsters need mittens. On weeknights this inviting little neighborhood spot has an easygoing cadence: it is busy enough to be sociable yet calm enough to offer intimacy. If it were not my job to blow the cover on such places I'd keep it to myself.Aside from the setting what lures Upper East Side regulars here is sprightly seafood cooking and smart unobtrusive service. Andrew Tun the Thai-born chef has an affinity for Oriental preparations which when successful can be light and spirited. His few failures are attributable to creativity at the expense of cohesion.The dining room behind a friendly little bar would not win any interior design awards - it is a jumble of brick grotto and pastel-shaded contemporary with medieval-looking art hanging next to country trompe-l'oeil murals - but somehow the composite is still appealing. A casually well-dressed Yorkville crowd drifts in nightly about 8.My favorite starter here has always been the tender ring-sized fried calamari with a side of tarragon tomato sauce. Instead of the undistinguished seafood salad try the heaping plate of tart arugula in a good vinaigrette garnished with big grilled shrimp or the same greens with delicious little slices of sweet Chinese pork sausage. Soups are uniformly good from the visually dramatic puree of roasted red peppers with mussels in their shells to a combination of salmon and meaty Manila clams in a creamy seafood stock. Fans of New England clam chowder might find the rendition here a bit precious - the clams are arranged around the plate in their shells - but the light broth is packed with flavor. One of the chef's more inventive successes is called scallop hash a thick patty of golden cubed potatoes and rare-cooked scallops infused with fresh thyme. The wine list carries 22 well-chosen whites but most are stiffly priced. Among the more reasonable are the 1987 Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay Russian River ($26) and the 1988 Cakebread Cellars Sauvignon Blanc ($25).

 0,It has been a hard year for romaine. A national food-poisoning outbreak tied to the lettuce this winter sickened hundreds of people across 35 states and killed five. The threat has passed but the sting lingers. Romaine for many households is still a tough sell. In mine commodity iceberg that old crunchy friend has lately been in ascendance and wedge salads have been the order of the day: pale green-white triangles drizzled in pale white-blue dressing with crumbles of bacon and bright red pops of cherry tomato and pricks of green chive strewn across the top. The crunch of it the bright colors the sweet and salt seem to please the children. Adults too.In restaurants of course wedge salads have done well for years even decades as essential steakhouse fare — “iceberg wedges blue cheese bacon” was Roger Sterling’s order on “Mad Men” when he and Don Draper saved the Madison Square Garden account in Season 3 set in 1963. But there is no reason not to bring them home. “There’s something special about this blank-slate juicy and crisp wad of iceberg that’s dripping with fat and crunch” Brooks Headley the chef and owner of Superiority Burger in New York City told me. “Doesn’t need a fancier lettuce. Just needs the bacon just right and the blue cheese not too fancy but also just right.”

 9,In the modern annals of political warfare no leader had been more effective than Yasir Arafat. He used its techniques and strategies to achieve major goals against an enemy far stronger militarily. But despite his successes once again his character and ambitions have led Palestinians to the brink of disaster.The Arafat techniques include an international propaganda campaign that made much of the world accept as truth the fiction that a part of Jerusalem is already a city in itself with an Arab majority belonging to Palestinians by history and right. Arab Jerusalem or East Jerusalem they call it.Any action by Israel to defend its interests and sovereignty in that fictitious city like opening a second door in an archeological tunnel or building apartments for Jews is denounced by Mr. Arafat and countries around the world as provocation and justification for Arab riots and terrorist murders.Terrorism is a built-in part of Mr. Arafat's political warfare. The technique is to promise to give it up as a weapon against the Jews. Collect for the promise. Then break it when necessary to put more pressure on Israel. Make the promise again. Collect.

 9,Mr. Miller looked back upon the campaign with satisfaction commenting: “I can't really say that as of this moment I would have changed anything that I have done.”At the outset he said the Republicans were placed on the defensive by Democratic allega­tions that Mr. Goldwater would risk nuclear war and abolish the Social Security and farm pro­grams so they had to dedicate a “considerable amount of time to setting the record straight.”But as the campaign has pro­gressed he said the Republicans have been able to take the in­itiative on such issues as for­eign policy fiscal responsibility limited Federal government and corruption.Mr. Miller said the Republi­cans' most effective issue had been the Administration's for­eign policy which throughout the campaign he has criticized as weak and vacillating. But he continued:“Maybe the issue we are get­ting the most votes on is the issue of corruption in govern­ment the breakdown of respect for law and order.”As to why he had stepped up his attacks on Senator Hubert H. Humphrey the Democratic Vice‐Presidential candidate in the final week Mr. Miller ex­plained that it was part of an “affirmative campaign” to show that the choice in Tues‐ day's election was “between private enterprise and social­ism.”Stresses A.D.A. AffiliationIn statements and speeches in the last week Mr. Miller has placed considerable empha­sis upon Mr. Humphrey's asso­ciation with the liberal Ameri­cans for Democratic Action and suggested that his oppo­nent had socialistic beliefs.Mr. Miller found no basis for the criticism that the Repub­licans had failed to offer a definite program during the campaign. He said the Repub­licans had spelled out their ideas on such issues as Cuba relations with allies and the So­viet Union and military strength.

 0,Defying modern presidential norms Mr. Trump has refused since he became a candidate for president to release any of his tax returns. Democrats suspect the tax information could provide clues to wrongdoing by Mr. Trump and they made getting the documents one of their top oversight priorities when they reclaimed control of the House in January.[A New York Times investigation showed that the president engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father.]Mr. Neal said he was making the request as part of his committee’s oversight of “the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.” Under I.R.S. policy the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year. Mr. Neal said the committee was considering legislation related to the issue.“I take the authority to make this request very seriously and I approach it with the utmost care and respect” Mr. Neal said in a statement. “This request is about policy not politics; my preparations were made on my own track and timeline entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration.”He added “I trust that in this spirit the I.R.S. will comply with federal law and furnish me with the requested documents in a timely manner.”In addition to Mr. Trump’s personal returns for 2013 to 2018 Mr. Neal requested returns for Mr. Trump’s trust and seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations including his golf club in Bedminster N.J. He also asked the I.R.S. to share any information it had related to the entities including whether they had been audited.Liberal Democrats have complained for weeks that Mr. Neal 70 and a roll-up-your-sleeves legislator was dragging his feet on making the request. They have organized events in his district taken out advertisements and produced legal briefs meant to make a case that he should act and act quickly.

For specific ideas about steps you can take I’d recommend Enough Project Save Darfur Coalition and the Genocide Intervention Network. If you have other suggestions please post.[An update: Reuters is reporting that fighting broke out on Saturday in a village west of Abyei. They’re reporting that 70 people were killed.]
 0,WASHINGTON — George T. Conway III the husband of the presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway has withdrawn himself from consideration to become the head of the Justice Department’s civil division he said in a statement on Friday citing family considerations as he became the latest sign of personnel woes at the White House.Mr. Conway had been President Trump’s pick to lead an office staffed by about 1000 lawyers — with a vast portfolio of cases dealing with issues ranging from national security to the actions of the president — but his nomination had not yet been submitted to the Senate. Mr. Conway’s decision to step aside comes as the White House — hobbled from the start by a sluggish transition that failed to generate a list of fully vetted candidates — is still struggling to fill some of the most important positions in the federal government.James Donovan whom Mr. Trump nominated last month to be the deputy secretary of the Treasury dropped out just three days later citing family considerations. Also last month Mark E. Green a Tennessee state senator and Army flight surgeon became the second person to withdraw as Mr. Trump’s prospective secretary of the Army.The president has also yet to settle on a new F.B.I. director after his abrupt firing last month of James B. Comey. Former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut announced he did not want to be considered for that position citing his law firm’s role in the legal team being assembled to represent Mr. Trump during investigations into whether his presidential campaign had ties to Russia.

 9,John Turner won a resounding endorsement today for his continued leadership of the Liberal Party at a national convention.Delegates to the convention voted to keep Mr. Turner by a margin of 2001 to 622.Gathering 76.3 percent of the vote Mr. Turner considerably surpassed the total various foes had said would be necessary for him to continue.Mr. Turner's victory represents a major comeback from his September 1984 defeat by the Progressive Conservative Party led by Brian Mulroney.''Now I know that I have your confidence'' Mr. Turner told the convention. He said his task now would be to prepare for a federal election in 1988.
 9,Mr. Gellman's book will not convince everybody but it is the solid heavily documented sort of work that will have to be taken into account by serious people as the debate about Nixon continues.It is a full-scale political biography of Nixon during his early career in politics. It is not a biography that adds a conspicuous store of new material to what has been presented by other writers over the years from Garry Wills to Stephen E. Ambrose to Henry A. Kissinger. But in directing our attention to what he portrays as the anti-Nixon myth and its endurance Mr. Gellman effectively joins the argument. At some point in almost every chapter he itemizes a few of the major allegations that have acquired the force of truth; then he tries to refute them.The overall effect of this is persuasive enough to cause some reflection on the entrenchment of images in American political life how a certain view of a figure enhanced by an unquestioning acceptance of the putative facts of that figure's life gains a kind of etched-in-stone validity. But some of Mr. Gellman's refutations are more persuasive than others. His detailed chapters on Nixon's defeat of the Democratic candidate Jerry Voorhis for Congress in 1946 addresses accusations that that Nixon was the handpicked choice of a cabal of monied conservative interests in Southern California and that he underhandedly and falsely charged Voorhis with gaining endorsements from the political action committee of the Congress of Labor Organizations which at that time was viewed as Communist-affiliated.Mr. Gellman shows that the California committee that approached the young Nixon to run for election in the state's 12th Congressional District was not a bunch of professional dirty-tricksters but an ordinary non-nefarious group of Republican activists. They were in Mr. Gellman's description doing nothing more than what many other groups of interested citizens Democratic and Republican have done for decades. As for the famous C.I.O.-political action committee connection Mr. Gellman shows that Voorhis did receive such endorsements endorsements that the candidate himself found troubling and had sought to keep quiet.An impressive element of Mr. Gellman's thorough research is that he is able to pinpoint when certain anti-Nixon myths were born and how they have been repeated over the decades. In the Voorhis case they began with a 1952 article in The New Republic by Ernest Brashear an unsuccessful candidate for the California State Assembly. Among other things Brashear wrote of legions of Nixon supporters' making anonymous phone calls to voters accusing Voorhis of being a Communist. Mr. Gellman finds no evidence that any such dirty trick took place.

 0,A Florida investor is seeking to block a $195 million preliminary settlement between tax shelter investors and KPMG and to disqualify the settlement's lawyers over what he calls a major conflict of interest.The investor Mark Kottler of Boca Raton Fla. argued in a brief filed in federal court in Newark on Thursday that lawyers at Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman negotiated the settlement on behalf of separate plaintiffs in a class action against KPMG.According to the brief those "secret negotiations" which Mr. Kottler said he was never informed of compromised a separate lawsuit filed on Mr. Kottler's behalf by Milberg Weiss against KPMG in a Florida state court in early 2004 on the same abusive tax shelters.Melvyn Weiss of Milberg Weiss said yesterday that his firm "would vigorously oppose their seeking to stay our settlement."

 9,Coach Rick Pitino threw a challenge at the Knicks and they met it by defeating the Milwaukee Bucks 113-103 tonight in what Trent Tucker called ''our biggest victory of the season.''The dare came when the coach completed the afternoon shootaround by saying: ''This game is going to be a barometer of how badly you want to make the playoffs. No more speeches no more motivational talks; it's your ball game now.''In posting only their fifth road victory in 35 games the Knicks (31-40) moved a game behind the Philadelphia 76ers and two behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the battle for the Eastern Conference's final two playoff spots. The Knicks have 11 games remaining 6 on the road and 5 at home where they have won 17 of their last 19 games. Knicks Shoot 53 PercentThe Knicks played some of their best defense of the season; they shot almost 53 percent from the field 10 percent higher than they averaged in the previous four games against the Bucks; and they outrebounded Milwaukee 51-39.

 9,For the most part those babies were either abandoned in hospitals at birth born with drugs in their systems or brought to the hospitals suffering from neglect or abuse.The study found 58 of the children about 60 percent were still in foster care in 1988 many because the paper work had not been done on time. Both the city and the private agencies who place children under contract were found to be at fault. 'Results Are Shocking'The 73-page report said that in 46 percent of the cases the agencies had failed to file a petition to end parental rights on time. In another 46 percent the city failed to respond on time to requests to put children up for adoption or to place them elsewhere.''The results are shocking'' Mr. Goldin said. ''These children have been shuffled from one temporary home to another. Morever indifference has been compounded by bad judgment.''For example the report said the city waited seven months to respond to an adoption request then denied the request because it was more than six months old. The child in that case who came into foster care after being neglected remains with foster parents who have said they will not adopt him.By law the city must respond to adoption requests within 30 days.The report said the city also failed to abide by the 30-day limit in a case involving a child who had not seen her mother in 22 months and who was listed as expected to ''return to parent.'' Although a request to put the child up for adoption was made in August 1987 the city had not responded after nine months. Deprived of AdoptionIn another case a child who was never visited by either parent was still not freed for adoption after almost three years the report said. Had proper procedure been followed the child could have been adopted shortly after his first birthday. Instead the report said ''adoption is still in the remote future.'' The 30-Day Limit
 9,Detroit LionsQuarterback Rodney Peete and the Lions resolved their contract differences. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed but the Lions said the contract was dependent upon Peete's passing his physical. A starter since his rookie season in 1989 Peete a sixth-round draft choice from the University of Southern California missed the last half of the 1991 season and the playoffs after tearing his Achilles' tendon. Seattle SeahawksThe Seahawks reeled in the big one coming to terms on a four-year deal with their 300-pound first-round draft choice Ray Roberts an offensive tackle from Virginia. Roberts (No. 10 over all in the 1992 draft) is expected to sign today leaving only one missing rookie wide receiver Michael Bates a sixth-round (No. 151) pick from Arizona. Bates has been excused from camp. He is on the United States Olympic track team as a 200-meter man. Denver BroncosIt's not that quarterback John Elway won't have any friends to throw to but after bidding adios to Ricky Nattiel (traded to Tampa Bay) and Vance Johnson (out for three months with a shoulder tear) the Broncos' Three Amigos are down to one Mark Jackson.The team's receiving corps has been further depleted by off-season back surgery to wide receiver Michael Young who is expected to miss most of training camp and a broken ankle suffered last Saturday by running back Steve Sewell a favorite Elway target on third down.

 9,With Mr. Claudio's face smeared with charcoal to symbolize the toll taken by the previous year the group accompanied the mule as it took on the sorrows and burdens of the neighborhood. And when they ended their journey at midnight -- hoarse tired and tipsy -- they would burn the mula their raggedy clothes and their worries starting the year anew.Theirs is the tradition of the parranda a caroling party rare in New York yet thriving in the snow and cold luring old ladies to shout excitedly from their windows. As the carolers slapped hand drums and tambourines the mule swayed down blocks lined with graffiti memorials gated windows and empty lots. They dropped in on beauty parlors bodegas firehouses and homes staying long enough at each stop to bring season's greetings as well as receive offerings of a few dollars in an upturned drum and perhaps a drink to brace for the journey.THE custom has journeyed from Puerto Rico though it is fading there as crime has discouraged the carolers from their rounds. Perhaps it is more needed in the Bronx; the carolers know that although they are far from home buried beneath their sweaters shirts and coats beat hearts strong with the rhythms of their youth."This is a seed that grows where we plant it" said Jose (Chema) Soto who has led this ragtag group for more than 15 years. "In any country we're in even on the moon on the moon we'd take out the mule."A few days earlier Chema had finished sewing the mule costume inside Rincon Criollo a wooden shack that is the headquarters in New York for the traditional music known as plena. Here in a room lined with portraits of Puerto Ricans ranging from Roberto Clemente to Fernando Ferrer the mule lay limp atop a freezer.

 0,Seventeen was once the magazine girls picked up before they turned 13 and cast aside well before they headed to senior prom.But Seventeen’s popularity has been growing with college students and now the magazine is introducing along with its August issue a 40-page supplement called Seventeen College Style. Due out Tuesday the issue includes articles on campus fashions creative ways to apply eye makeup for rush week events and affordable ways to decorate a dorm room and make it the “hangout study haven makeout spot of your dreams” according to the magazine.In developing material Seventeen worked with several Web sites including hercampus.com aimed at women in college and relied on a survey of 1000 female college students. It also tried to tailor its articles to women on a variety of campuses.“We are the magazine that helps them go to college” said Ann Shoket Seventeen’s editor in chief. “We designed the stories so that it was drilled down to what kind of college you are going to.”Seventeen views the supplement as a safe investment citing data from the media research firm GfK MRI showing that the number of 18- to 24-year-old women reading the magazine jumped by 17 percent in the last five years.Ms. Shoket credits the growth partly to the events it has been holding on college campuses where copies of the magazine and samples from advertisers are distributed to students. For the last five years Seventeen has also run a “Freshman 15” program in which 15 women write blogs about their first year.Danai Kadzere a 19-year-old Harvard student entering her junior year who appears in the latest issue said that after taking a break from reading Seventeen for a couple of years she returned to it because she wanted to see clothes she could actually buy.“Vogue I cannot afford a single thing in there. But in Seventeen I can afford most of all of it” said Ms. Kadzere. “In college your parents aren’t paying for your clothes anymore. Even with a summer job it still doesn’t come up to being able to afford a $100 T-shirt.”

 0,This summer the bookstore chain Borders is starting a program to apply the market research techniques of the grocery store business to the sales of novels and nonfiction books. One of its first lessons may be that comparing books to frozen foods is a sure way to raise the ire of authors regardless of the details.Last week Ralph Nader Noam Chomsky and 26 other authors signed a letter to the chairman of Borders Gregory P. Josefowicz arguing that the new program called category management would hurt small publishers and narrow the stores' selection. Their main gripe was that Borders invited publishers -- for fees that can reportedly run more than $100000 -- to be ''category captains'' for each of 250 categories from cookbooks to thrillers.Learning of the program Mr. Nader and the authors began to fear that the sponsoring publishers would effectively control the shelves at the stores at the expense of others promoting their own books over those from smaller publishers and reducing the variety of titles sold.''There is a difference between books and Pop-Tarts'' the letter warned. ''Leave the category management to the soap merchants.''

 9,''The retail location was disappointing'' he said. ''We had fewer visitors and sales than here at Lenz'' which is on Main Road (Route 25). He did not dismiss the idea of finding a new retail location on the South Shore but said he would ''not look for one very actively at this time.'' Mr. Carroll also expressed doubts about whether ''Sagpond Vineyards' success notwithstanding'' the South Fork was as viable a viticultural -- grape growing --area as the North Fork. There are two other wineries on the South Fork Sagpond in Sagaponack and Duck Walk in Water Mill. (A new label Channing Daughters Vineyard owned by Walter and Molly Channing of Bridgehampton is making its debut this fall. The wine is made by Lenz.) The North Fork has 14 wineries and more seem to be on the way.''The South Fork has a shorter growing season than the North Fork it is harder to get grapes to ripen there and you need early ripening grapes'' Mr. Carroll said. ''I am not willing to do a Duck Walk -- to buy property and plant vineyards.'' He was referring to a sizeable investment in replanting defunct vineyards made by Dr. Herodotus Damianos the owner of Pindar Vineyards in Peconic after he purchased the bankrupt Le Reve winery in 1994 and renamed it Duck Walk.A further complication Mr. Carroll said is that as a condition for permitting a winery to be established the Town of Southampton requires that at least 75 percent of the grapes used in its products must be grown in the town.What went wrong?''The quality of the Bridgehampton wines already in bottles was not as high as the Lenz wine that we were used to producing and selling'' Mr. Carroll said. ''I thought that in the wholesale area my people could sell Lenz and Bridgehampton but that proved not to be a good assumption. The differences in quality --and the prices which were close together made it hard.''What I should have done was to have discounted the wine and used the cash flow to buy new grapes and thereby make better wine. But this didn't dawn on me until the beginning of 1996 by which time it was a bit late in the game with the lease expiration coming up in September.''Mr. Greenfield who has a summer home in Amagansett and is a partner in a Manhattan-based company that composes music and jingles for television and radio planted vines in 1979. His first commercial vintage was in 1982 and he opened the winery the next year. (It was preceded by the Hargrave Vineyard in Cutchogue in 1973 and Lenz in 1978.)Over the years the Bridgehampton Winery always a boutique operation won more than 150 medals in competitions. Its chardonnays have often been attractive especially those made by its winemaker of 11 years Richard Olsen-Harbich who is now with Jamesport Vineyards. He was one of the earliest producers of sophisticated barrel fermented chardonnay on the East End.
 0,DEAR DIARY:The passenger elevator in our building is undergoing a total overhaul so we're forced to use the service elevator. It's amazing how this small change harkens one back to a simpler time. I hate to admit it but I'm hoping the repair takes longer than expected.There's a certain civility to being taken swiftly and directly to your floor. The operator almost takes pride in remembering where you're going. He's quick to make small talk and we all seem quick to make it back. If you're just going down to the basement to do laundry the operator will sometimes stay and wait for you. If someone is in a hurry he'll bypass a stop or two to get that person home all the quicker.And the change in the building is remarkable. Whereas before we just stared at the numbers hoping that no one would break the silence people now seem quick to converse on the elevator talking about where they've come from or where they're going the weather outside.Perhaps it's the novelty of the experience but I'd like to think it's a process of being conjoined by this silly lift carrying us from floor to floor. Before we were separated by the sterile technology of the automatic elevator. Now we're connected by the human presence on the lift. For a while at least it's almost as if we live in one big apartment. Gino DiIorio
 9,President Reagan has moved to give more prestige to the delegation he sent to Geneva to negotiate arms reduction with the Soviet Union. To impress the Russians with the caliber of the delegation the President has given what is called ''personal rank of Ambassador'' to four deputies and one coordinator at the talks.The ranks given to people on special missions carry no pay increase and are valid for only six months. The recipients are checked by the F.B.I. before the President gives them the titles and he sends their names to the Senate but the Senate need not advise or consent.The new holders of the personal rank are John A. Woodworth Warren Zimmerman Lewis A. Dunn Henry F. Cooper and Ronald F. Lehman 2d.''There are no perks involved'' said Herman J. Cohen Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Personnel. ''These guys are there for that mission and the ranks are for the benefit of their counterparts on the opposite side. They show that we're serious about these negotiations.''

 0,A YEAR ago at the start of soft-shell crab season I made an unusually fortunate discovery in the usual way: accidentally. I had long been a fan of grilling soft-shell crabs but mostly out of laziness. Soft-shell crabs are best sautéed not so much for the crust they develop -- most are more than a little crunchy naturally and retain their crunch no matter how you cook them -- but because cooking in a pan helps retain at least some of their flavorful juices.Still it makes an awful mess. First you need at least eight soft-shells for four people so two big pans are in order. More inconvenient soft-shell crabs are notorious spatterers so the cleanup time is longer than the cooking time.That endless cleanup is why when I learned how to grill soft-shells 20 years ago it became my method of choice. You can cook two dozen crabs at once on a large grill there is no cleanup and the crabs like almost everything else taste great when grilled. Of course there is a compromise involved: as the crabs exude their juices the source of the spattering in stove-top cooking those juices drip onto the fire and are gone forever. But the crabs shrivel and dry out a bit and their small legs inevitably become charred. To compensate I usually basted the grilling crabs with liquid usually a mixture of butter lemon and Tabasco. (By the way I don't want to denigrate this technique. It will remain in my repertory.)Then there's the weather: it's difficult and unpleasant to grill in the inevitable spring rain. So last year when the crabs started arriving and I prepared to grill them and it began raining I did what I usually do when I can't grill: I broiled. And I discovered that this simple alternative solved the problems inherent in both sautéing and grilling. The crabs did not spatter (or if they did I didn't notice) and they remained plump and juicy. A sprinkle of salt a drizzle of lemon (some olive oil is nice but not necessary) and that was that.
 9,According to Mr. Zumwalt Mr. Bull took out last July 11 a tape that purported to cover all conversations held in the President's hideaway in the Executive Office Building from April 11 through April 16. It was on April 15 a Sunday that the President talked with Mr. Dean for an hour after 9 P.M. But it was not until Oct. 27 or 28 the White House says that Mr. Buzhardt or anyone else discovered that the tape that Mr. Bull had withdrawn from security on July 11 did not contain the Nixon‐Dean conversation at all. The President's special counsel told the court today that one six‐hour tape had been available in the office in the Executive Office Building to record the April 14–15 weekend and that it had been exhausted during a busy weekend of talk before the Dean conversation began Sunday night.Interviewed after today's hearing Mr. Buzhardt said that the last conversation appearing on the April 15 tape was one between Mr. Nixon and Richard G. Kleindienst then Attorney General after lunch on Sunday.The White House counsel said that no attempt to audit the April 15 tape for the Dean conversation had been made until last weekend because “we thought we were going to win the suit” brought by Archibald Cox then the special Watergate prosecutor to obtain the tapes for the grand jury.Mr. Dean testified before the Senate Watergate committee earlier this year that the President had told him on April 15 that Mr. Nixon had been “foolish” to discuss clemency for E. Howard Hunt Jr. one of the convicted Watergate burglars with Charles W. Colson then special counsel to the President.The second conversation at issue—a telephone conversation with Mr. Mitchell—was never recorded Mr. Buzhardt said yesterday because the President made the call from a hall phone in the White House that was not attached to the recording system.At the White House officials provided anonymously much the same scenario on the unrecorded conversations that Mr. Buzhardt was outlining in Federal court. They said that a six‐hour tape would have handled any ordinary weekend since Mr. Nixon was often out of town on Saturday and Sunday and when he was not rarely used the Executive Office Building facility extensively.Explaining why the missing conversations had been discovered so recently a White House official said “We believed the President would never let go of these tapes and no one believed there was any need to find out what was on them.”

 0,Mr. Andres 52 is among several members of the Mueller team who came from private practice and he is believed to be the first to return.Most of the lawyers were temporarily assigned to the inquiry from other posts in the Justice Department and many are returning to United States attorneys’ offices and other department jobs; at least one other prosecutor is going into private practice . One will teach at a law school.At Davis Polk where Mr. Andres was a partner before joining the special counsel’s team in August 2017 he will return to handle white-collar defense and other litigation. During his time in Washington he lived in a sparsely furnished one-bedroom apartment near Union Station a short walk from the Special Counsel’s office and a location that would hasten his Amtrak commute home to New York on weekends to see his wife — a federal judge — and their three daughters. Mr. Andres said he is happy “to be home.”Earlier in his career Mr. Andres spent a dozen years at the Justice Department 10 of them as a prosecutor at the office of the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. There he eventually rose to head the office’s Criminal Division.He had handled scores of cases against organized crime figures playing a central role in an effort that gutted the Bonanno crime family and led to the convictions of more than 70 mobsters. He led the team that won murder and racketeering convictions against the Bonanno boss Joseph C. Massino who in 2005 facing the death penalty became the first Mafia chieftain to testify against his own family.Mr. Massino revealed at the time that Mr. Andres’ success against the Bonannos had not gone unnoticed. He told the F.B.I. that the family’s then acting boss Vincent Basciano known as Vinny Gorgeous had plotted to kill Mr. Andres and the federal judge who oversaw Mr. Basciano’s trial.Mr. Andres spent his final two years at the Justice Department in Washington working as a deputy assistant attorney general overseeing the Criminal Division’s sections for fraud organized crime and gangs death penalty cases and appeals. He helped oversee some of the earliest efforts to prosecute crimes arising from the 2008 financial crisis.Now he will be defending some of the same types of companies and executives.“No one is really better at getting to the heart of complex financial issues and that includes convincing the government when it doesn’t have a case” said Neil MacBride the former United States attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia who is now the co-head of Davis Polk’s white-collar defense group.Noah Weiland contributed reporting.

 9,''As soon as I heard the record I caught the songwriting fever once and for all and decided I belonged on Tin Pan Alley - you couldn't tear me away from the profession after that'' he said.Mr. Parish estimates he collaborated with at least a hundred different composers over the years. Though his writing techniques have varied from situation to situation his approach toward lyrics has been quick and intuitive.''In many cases I was given both a tune and a title'' he said. ''Sometimes I would write a 'dummy' lyric with words that didn't mean anything in order to get the rhythmic flow. Then I would come up with the actual words. Occasionally a dummy lyric ends up being the final lyric. Irving Caesar's 'Tea for Two' is a famous example.''Once I had a title I would take it home walk around with it for awhile to let it percolate and then sit down to write. The actual writing time was usually a half hour to an hour. I didn't believe in laboring over a lyric too much because the song would sound too worked over.''Mr. Parish found working with a predetermined title to be a nuisance albeit one that sometimes yielded artistic dividends. In the lyrics of both ''Star Dust'' and ''Sophisticated Lady'' the actual song titles aren't repeated in the catch phrases of the chorus but occur almost incidentally in the narrative helping to sustain the smooth natural flow of imagery. The lyric of ''Star Dust'' is especially striking in the way the verse seems to begin in the middle of a thought: ''. . .And now the purple dust of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart.''The history of ''Star Dust'' illustrates Mr. Parish's belief that songs that are overnight sensations tend to be quickly forgotten while those that come to be recognized as standards often have a longer quieter gestation in the public consciousness.Hoagy Carmichael wrote and recorded the melody for ''Star Dust'' in 1927 as a jazz instrumental heavily influenced by Bix Beiderbecke. Mr. Parish wrote the lyric in 1929 and it became a hit the following year in a recording by Isham Jones the tenor saxophonist bandleader and songwriter (''I'll See You in My Dreams'' ''It Had to Be You'') who led one of the most popular orchestras of the pre-swing era. The following year Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong also had minor hit versions of the song.

 9,Richard Holbrooke chose wisely in starting his new job as America's delegate to the United Nations with a three-day trip to Kosovo. Peace and democracy will take root in the province only if Washington and the U.N. closely coordinate their efforts. Mr. Holbrooke an experienced Balkan hand is well suited to help make that happen. He enjoys President Clinton's full confidence and is also on good terms with the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and the organization's chief administrator in Kosovo Bernard Kouchner.Mr. Holbrooke met with local leaders and international officials and got a closer view of the violence against Kosovo's Serbian and Gypsy minorities. His visit to a mass grave of Kosovar Albanians near Stara Cikatova where 129 bodies have so far been exhumed called attention to the terrible Serbian atrocities that led to international intervention. But Mr. Holbrooke also made clear that the new Kosovo must move beyond an endless cycle of ethnic retribution. He pointedly and properly reminded Hashim Thaci the political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army that Washington intends to hold the K.L.A. to its commitment to demilitarize its forces by Sept. 19 and turn to peaceful competition with other political parties.Only 25000 Serbs remain in Kosovo out of a prewar population of 180000. NATO and the U.N. must protect those who have stayed and eventually encourage others to return. Mr. Holbrooke recognized that this will take time since Serbs and ethnic Albanians cannot yet easily live alongside each other. Unlike Bosnia Kosovo is going to have a single dominant ethnic group the Albanians. But Serbs and Gypsies who have also lived in the province for generations must also have a right to reside there in peace.That can happen if the U.N. moves strongly to establish democratic institutions and impartial rule of law. The international war crimes tribunal can also help by bringing more prosecutions against Serbs responsible for this spring's atrocities. Punishment of those directly guilty might discourage collective retribution against all remaining Serbs.

 0,There’s a neat trick at work in Joe Krozel’s puzzle: using the same clues for consecutive entries. He does this three times at the top in the middle and at the bottom.Much like yesterday’s puzzle all these “givens” in the grid considerably restrict what can be done with the fill. Again the results mostly belie that difficulty.At 31 and 32 Down ARTEL and BAHA’I aren’t the most mainstream entries but they should be familiar enough crossword fodder for many. WOTAN across the way is a bit more obscure unless of course you’re a fan of Wagner’s Ring Cycle.Down below extra credit goes to all who filled in NYASA and GOLGI without using all the crossers. Camillo Golgi was an Italian cytologist whose name has been lent to several microscopical methods and types of cells. He was mentioned just this week in The Times (last paragraph).Before I hand things over to Mr. Krozel I’ll acknowledge a slight case of theme greediness. After finishing my solve I went back to analyze the pairs of like-clued entries hoping to find different parts of speech for each pair. It did happen in four cases which I particularly appreciated. For example “Mean” was a noun for AVERAGE and a verb for SIGNIFY. Of course asking the puzzle to do that for all nine pairs on top of what it has already accomplished would be an adjective for “Mean” — inhuman.Notes From Joe KrozelI got the idea for today’s crossword from this puzzle by Matt Ginsberg in which pairs of 7-letter entries were anagrams of each other (I even used a similar grid layout). But more than that I have Matt to thank for something else that made today’s puzzle possible; Matt had assembled a word database that he generously shared with his fellow constructors. Within that database is a feature that cross-references entries of the same length that have been clued with the exact same verbiage. So I scoured that list and manually extracted as many 7-letter entries that fit that description.Finally some solvers have remarked that constructors try to misdirect them by using clues that have two meanings … I suppose I’ve been caught red-handed!

 0,Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work.Carolyn SilveiraBig institutions are often slow to awaken to major social transformations. Microsoft was famously late to grasp the importance of the Internet. American auto manufacturers were slow to identify the demand for fuel-efficient cars. And today the United States government is making a similar mistake: it still doesn’t seem to recognize that Americans no longer work the way they used to.Today some 42 million people — about a third of the United States work force — do not have jobs in the traditional sense. They fall into a catchall category the government calls “contingent” workers. These people — independent contractors freelancers temp workers part-timers people between jobs — typically work on a project-to-project basis for a variety of clients and most are outcasts from the traditional system of benefits that provide economic security to Americans. Even as the economy has changed employment benefits are still based on an outdated industrial-era model in which workers are expected to stay with a single company for years if not their whole careers.The industrial-era model of employer-based health care no longer applies.For most of the 20th century it was efficient to link benefits to jobs this way. But today more and more work falls outside the one-to-one employee-to-employer relationship. Work is decentralized workers are mobile and working arrangements are fluid. However the risks of life haven’t gone away: people still need protections. They just need a different system to distribute them. They need benefits that they can carry around like their laptops. As things stand millions of independent workers go without health and unemployment insurance protection against discrimination and unpaid wages and pension plans. It makes no sense.One of the social innovators to recognize this problem early and act on it was Sara Horowitz the founder of the Freelancers Union which has more than 165000 members across all 50 states. At Fixes we highlight practical applications of ideas that have the potential to achieve widespread impact. That means looking at how ideas take root in institutions that become part of the fabric of society.In the early 20th century a landscape of new institutions — including the early labor unions and hundreds of civil society organizations like Rotary International the Boy and Girl Scouts and the N.A.A.C.P. — reshaped the American landscape. Today the Freelancers Union offers a glimpse of the kind of social enterprise — mission-driven and pragmatic market-savvy and cooperative — that is likely to proliferate in the coming years to meet the needs of a fast-changing work force and society.Horowitz had been a labor lawyer and union organizer when in the early 1990s she recognized that the number of people turning to independent work was on the rise. It was also clear that institutions had not yet been built to represent them in any meaningful way. (On one occasion Horowitz found herself misclassified by an employer as an independent contractor — and quickly discovered that she received no job benefits.) Horowitz had the idea to create an organization to bring freelancers together so they could wield their power in the marketplace and in the political arena much like AARP does for retirees.She quickly discovered that their biggest concern was the cost of health insurance. But there were other problems too. Unlike traditional workers who receive unemployment benefits independent contractors have to rely on their own resources to get through hard times. In 2009 Freelancers Union surveyed 3000 members and found that more than 80 percent had gone jobless or underemployed during the year. More than 60 percent had used their credit cards or borrowed from friends and family to make ends meet and 12 percent had to turn to food stamps. Close to 40 percent had given up or downgraded their health insurance protection.Another problem was getting paid. Some companies like Time Inc. actually charge freelancers penalties if they request payment within 25 days. Freelancers Union found that 77 percent of its members had been cheated by a client during their careers and 40 percent had had trouble getting paid in 2009. The average wage loss was $6000. The Department of Labor protects traditional workers from unpaid wages but freelancers have no equivalent recourse. Then there were difficulties obtaining mortgages the lack of access to 401(k) plans and other issues.An insurance provider that stays viable by not seeking to maximize profits.Horowitz saw that she could attract a large membership if she could figure out how to provide health insurance at lower cost. Health insurance companies don’t have much love for freelancers. They prefer to serve large groups because it’s easier to deal with one corporate benefits manager than a multitude of individuals. And because insurers often lack reliable information about independent workers they tend to assume that they are risky. As a result premiums in the open marketplace for health insurance are higher and more volatile than those for employees. (The Affordable Care Act is designed to address this problem beginning in 2014 by subsidizing private insurance but it applies only to people with low and moderate incomes.)Horowitz got the idea of grouping freelancers in New York State so they could purchase their health insurance together. It made sense in theory but it had never been done. She worked closely with officials in Albany notably Assemblyman Sheldon Silver who was a strong ally and Gregory Serio the former superintendent of insurance for New York State who had the authority to grant approval for “discretionary” insurance groups.“A lot of health insurers have looked at individual and sole proprietors as very expensive and risky to underwrite” explained Serio. “Sara was able to foresee a trend [in the rise of independent work] before a lot of other people did. She went and found out that these people were not bad risks. Her creativity was in using existing concepts of insurance risk sharing and applying it to a community that has been ignored by the marketplace and in fact almost vilified by the marketplace.”Serio and Horowitz made an interesting team. “I was a conservative Republican from Nassau County working for George Pataki” he told me. “And she was my liberal friend from Brooklyn.” But Serio found the idea of protecting freelancers appealing because his father had been a dentist who operated out of a second-floor walk-up office on Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven Queens. “I grew up in a sole proprietor household” he said. “If my father didn’t work he didn’t get paid. And I knew what it was like seeing health insurance rates go up and up.”Today the Freelancers Insurance Company (F.I.C.) which is wholly owned by the Freelancers Union (a nonprofit) has revenues of roughly $100 million and covers 25000 independent workers and their family members in New York State offering them premiums that the company calculates are more than a third below the open market rate. Close to 60 percent of its clients were previously uninsured or on COBRA (a temporary extension of their previous insurance). The renewal rate last year was 97 percent. (Disclosure: I have purchased health insurance from F.I.C. for a number of years.) The company was financed with $17 million in loans and grants from social investors including the Rockefeller Foundation the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the New York City Investment Fund. “Our freelancers have access to the best doctors and hospitals” says Horowitz. “We have skilled human resource people just like Fortune 500 companies. We’re able to watch out for our members.”How can the F.I.C. undercut market rates and still be a viable enterprise? The key is that while it seeks to be profitable it does not seek to maximize profits. Its executives receive salaries that are below industry averages and it has only one shareholder (the Freelancers Union) to satisfy. Those are fundamental differences. Silver who is the speaker of the State Assembly notes that the success of the F.I.C. makes it more difficult for traditional insurers to contend that they can’t deliver insurance at lower cost. “Duplicating the model and showing the ability of [the F.I.C.] to keep costs under control is something that we will be looking at” he adds.Like many social goods health insurance is often seen through a binary lens: either it must be handled by the government or it must be handled by the free market. But the F.I.C. is demonstrating that a middle way can work too and that it may be preferable to provide vital services like insurance through social-benefit companies at least to certain customer groups. In fact the Affordable Care Act has a provision to finance a new type of nonprofit health insurance company that would be run by its customers. It would be called a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP). The Freelancers Union has proposed to establish CO-OPs in Florida New Jersey New York Oregon and Washington.Because the F.I.C. has a close connection with freelancers it can be more effective helping its members make good health care decisions. “We’re moving away from fee-for-service medicine to one where a primary care doctor aggressively coordinates care” explains Horowitz. “We’re also trying to innovate with alternative care — promoting meditation yoga and nutrition which can have long-term beneficial effects.” In 2012 the organization will be opening up the Brooklyn Freelancers Medical Practice a health center modeled on the medical-home approach and designed in partnership with a physician named Rushika Fernandopulle who pioneered a team-based model of care that is attracting attention across the country.For now the United States government doesn’t keep an accurate count of the independent work force. This is an oversight. It appears likely that this way of working will continue to grow. In cities with concentrations of knowledge workers you find a proliferation of co-working spaces designed specifically for freelancers. And online marketplaces for freelancers like Etsy oDesk and Elance are expanding rapidly.Related More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series.It’s not just hipsters who work like this. Forty-five percent of Freelancers Union members are over 40 years old. Not all follow this path by choice. Many freelancers are former employees like journalists who lost jobs. Recent college graduates discovering that a degree is far from a job guarantee are forced to be more entrepreneurial. And many companies seeking to hold costs down engage freelancers rather than hire full-time workers. All of these workers deserve the same protections accorded to others.“The industrial workers of the 20th century helped bring about the New Deal” says Horowitz. “But the New Deal hasn’t evolved to include independent workers. I think this work force will help bring about the next New Deal — a framework of economic security that is parallel in its goals but led by a network of new institutions.”“The government can’t replace civil society” she added. “So if the civil society organizations have control it will be harder to have your benefits taken away — if you happen to lose an election.”On Wednesday I’ll report on some of the other ways the Freelancers Union is helping to make independent work more secure.

 0,He said some of his shots had been disrupted by Patrick Ewing the 37-year-old Knicks center. ''He might be an old guy but he still can change a shot'' Carter said. ''Couple times I got in there and he bumped me in the air and caused me to miss a couple easy layups.''And some found fault with Carter for passing instead of shooting when the Raptors had a chance to win in the final moments of Game 2 last Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. Projected as the heir to Michael Jordan as the N.B.A.'s next marquee attraction Carter in the past week seemed to be the epitome of his team: not quite ready for the rarefied air of the playoffs.Charles Oakley the former Knick described the Raptors' season as ''more hype than what we're trying to accomplish as a team.''He added: ''We haven't done anything as a team. We're still building.''Worse than hype for Carter and others was the nasty exchange of words between Coach Butch Carter and several of his players last week. Among other things the coach said his roster lacked leadership. He took Christie out of his starting role. Christie used the words ludicrous and dumb to describe the coach's comments. Dee Brown said the coach's remarks about player leadership were a cop-out. In that Butch Carter does not approve of headbands Christie and Brown decided to wear black ones today.When asked about communication with his coach since the demotion Christie replied: ''I haven't talked to him once. He hasn't said anything to me. What's expected of me he needs to let me know so I can go out there and do it.'' Of the other distractions of this series such as Butch Carter's brief lawsuit against Marcus Camby of the Knicks Christie said: ''I don't think I'll remember this series for anything on the court. It'll be off the court that this series is remembered.''

 9,To the Editor:Apropos the recurring confusion generated by the Lincoln's Birthday and Washington's Birthday holidays: Let's add to it. On George Washington's birth certificate it says that he was born on Feb. 11 1731. In the textbooks it says that he was born Feb. 22 1732. Which side is correct? Both as usual.When Julius Caesar developed his calendar his solar calculations were off by 11 minutes and 14 seconds a year. It added up over time. When Pope Gregory XIII developed his calendar in 1582 the disparity had reached 10 days. Gregory decreed that Oct. 4 1582 should be called Oct. 15.England and its colonies finally adopted the Gregorian calendar on Sept. 2 1752 decreeing the next day should be Sept. 14 thus bridging the 11-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Thus too George Washington's birth date was transposed from Feb. 11 1731 (called Old Style) to Feb. 22 1732 (New Style). The British act also fixed the start of the new year at Jan. 1.Since the calendar was changed in September moving January and February to the beginning of the year Washington did not have a birthday in 1731. He skipped a year and thus became 11 days older and one year younger. JOHN M. CULKIN New York Feb. 22 1991

 0,The N.F.L. and its players have been throwing verbal barbs at each other in recent weeks as they try to work out a new labor agreement. The players union though appears to have lost at least one megaphone.CBS College Sports Network has refused to air a commercial produced by the N.F.L. Players Association for Saturday’s Texas-America All-Star game which is sponsored by the union.As part of their nearly year-old agreement with the hosts of the event and College Sports Network the union says it was promised two minutes of free air time with no content restrictions.So it produced a 30-second and a one-minute commercial the first cuts of which were given to the network in mid-January according to George Atallah a spokesman for the players union. He added that the network rejected them late last week saying that it did not want to get in the middle of the dispute over the collective bargaining agreement.The one-minute version of the commercial clearly flouts the union’s agenda. It features scenes of empty stadiums locker rooms and gyms and fans and players saying “let them play” and “let us play” and an allusion to the threat of a lockout by the N.F.L. owners if a new labor deal is not reached by March 3.At the end of the commercial the screen reads “Do Your Part to Let Us Play. Sign the petition at www.nfllockout.com//www.nfllockout.com/.”“It’s unfortunate they seem to be scared off” Atallah said of the network. “I hope this puts the spotlight on the college all-star game and the players who might be locked out.”Dana McClintock a spokesman for CBS College Sports Network confirmed that the network did not want to take sides in the labor dispute and that it wouldn’t run a similar ad from N.F.L. either. CBS is one of four networks that pays the N.F.L. $4 billion to broadcast their games.Addressing suspicions that the network balked so as not to offend the league Greg Aiello a spokesman for the N.F.L. said the league did not know about the network’s decision and had no objection to anyone running the ad.
 9,"Turnover causes us tremendous heartburn" said Robert Coletta general sales and service manager for G.M.'s Buick division. Salespeople he said need about a year to fully understand a manufacturer's products and a dealer's procedures. And as cars grow more complex he added that learning period grows longer.One of the earliest deferred bonus plans began two years at Volkswagen which for every car sold pays the sales representative $150 -- in three installments spread over two years. The bonus comes on top of whatever commission the dealer pays the sales staff. Volkswagen officials have no statistics on whether the program has reduced turnover but they say dealers have told them it has helped.Audi of America offers yearly bonuses of $6000 to salespeople who sell 60 cars and $12000 and a trip to Germany to those who push 120 cars out the door. The wait is not as long as with Volkswagen's program but the idea is the same: to keep top producers in the fold some of whom had left as sales drooped."If you lose a guy who's worth a hundred cars a year it's like losing a whole dealer" said Joseph H. Tate general sales manager of Audi of America.Fritz Hitchcock the owner of the Toyota dealership where Mr. Salcido works calls the traditional commission system "very destructive." But Mr. Hitchcock who has set up his own deferred-bonus program doubts whether other alternatives -- some sort of guaranteed salary say -- would be the answer. "It's hard to figure out if a guy is giving you his all if he's on a guarantee as opposed to a commission" Mr. Hitchcock said.Mr. Salcido and other salesmen said that deferred bonus programs like the one offered by General Motors were a nice perk but were not enough to make salespeople stick around after several slow months at a dealership. "It's an extra but people want money now said one Detroit-area car salesman who insisted that he not be identified. "My mortgage bill is now." An Inherently Transient BusinessSalespeople and car dealers say they applaud any programs designed to reduce turnover and improve the image of salespeople. But many also believe the incentives or courses do not address the fundamental realities of selling cars that make it such a transient business: long hours few benefits and unpredictable paychecks.

 9,Prime Minister Romano Prodi's new center-left Government passed a critical test in the Chamber of Deputies today winning a vote of confidence with the "conditional" help of 35 hard-line leftist deputies whose support it needs for a majority.Coming after a victory in the Italian Senate last week the 322-to-299 vote in Parliament's lower house gives the new Government full powers six weeks after a leftist-leaning coalition won national elections for the first time in Italian history.But the Olive Tree the new group headed by the politically untested Mr. Prodi fell short of a majority of seats in the 630-member Chamber of Deputies. It will have to rely on the small Communist Refounding Party a splinter group of far-leftists to carry out a program that mixes fiscal austerity with political change.Mr. Prodi who went to Germany this week on his first foreign visit as Prime Minister has signaled his determination to reduce Italy's deficit. He is preparing to bring the lira back into Europe's exchange rate mechanism by the end of the year and eventually to qualify for the European currency union.

 0,The New York Times Company said on Friday that it had sold more than half of its minority ownership in the Boston Red Sox and several other sports properties.The company sold 390 of the 700 Class B units of the Fenway Sports Group that it owned to three separate buyers in a deal for $117 million. The company which did not disclose the buyers expects to record a pretax gain of about $64 million in the third quarter because of the sale.The sale leaves the company with 310 shares or about a 7 percent stake in the Fenway Sports Group.

 0,IF a computer can have sex appeal it is probably demonstrated most clearly in high-end gaming laptops. While young men in decades past might have lusted after the latest automotive hardware the players (almost all young men) who gathered at a gaming party near Buffalo last month have a different passion. It made them enthusiastic road-testers of three roughly comparable laptops -- from Alienware Dell and VoodooPC -- that a reporter asked them to size up.Each laptop came with a DVD/CD burner 1 gigabyte of RAM a 60-gigabyte hard drive and built-in Wi-Fi networking capability. All were in the $3000 vicinity.The Dell and VoodooPC units also had Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The VoodooPC included a built-in videoconferencing camera and the Alienware had its own remote control. The VoodooPC included the Professional version of Windows XP while the others used the Home Edition.Dell's unit was the fastest but with its bulky case it also ran the coolest. The VoodooPC was not quite as fast as the others but its lustrous finish and elegant design attracted the most attention. The Alienware fit between the other two in both styling and speed. (The makers of Alienware and VoodooPC in particular pointed out that the laptops they provided were not at the top of their product lines; the best are even faster and can top $4000.)

 0,Chrysler founded in 1925 has had a tumultuous history as the third-largest of Detroit’s auto companies. Known in the years after World War II for its well-engineered cars it has spent the last three decades bouncing between highs and lows The New York Times’s Micheline Maynard writes.Facing financial difficulties in the late 1990s Chrysler merged with Daimler the German automaker in 1998. The conjoined company DaimlerChrysler was split apart in 2007 in a deal with Cerberus Capital Management.The company encountered financial turbulence in the late 1970s that prompted it to seek a Congressional bailout a process that vaulted its chief executive Lee A. Iacocca to national prominence. Chrysler paid off the loans early in the 1980s when it enjoyed success thanks to its minivans and a family of fuel-efficient autos called the K-cars.In 1987 Chrysler bought the No. 4 automaker American Motors but the subsequent consolidation prompted another financial crisis that led to a restructuring of the company. In the 1990s Chrysler came back again with vehicles like the powerful Dodge Viper sports car and its Jeep lineup. In 1998 Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz of Germany and spent the next eight years as part of DaimlerChrysler.But its inconsistent financial results and pressure from German shareholders prompted Daimler to seek a buyer in 2007. It sold the company to Cerberus Capital Management an investment fund which installed Robert L. Nardelli the former chief executive of Home Depot as its chief executive. Mr. Nardelli vowed that Chrysler would make a comeback as an American-owned company yet the automaker like others in Detroit was battered by a deep sales slump last year as a recession took hold.In November Chrysler joined General Motors in seeking assistance from Congress which rejected the company’s bid forcing the Bush administration to step in with a financial lifeline. In January Chrysler announced it had reached a tentative deal with Fiat and in March President Obama gave the companies 30 days to conclude the transaction.That effort culminated in a restructuring plan in which Fiat would take a major role in the company’s management and the United Automobile Workers and major lenders agreed to concessions. But with the Obama administration unable to get support from all of the bondholders for the plan it is now up to a federal bankruptcy court to determine the details of Chrysler’s immediate future.Go to Article from The New York Times »
 9,To the Editor:Your coverage of the Persian Gulf war welcome-home celebrations in New York City and Washington highlights the incongruent priorities in Federal and local policies.The Washington celebration focused on hardware (news story June 9). It cost $12 million (including an unforeseen $4 million cost overrun) and the Pentagon picked up a $7 million bill. Only about 200000 people showed up. The veterans and their families were treated to corporate donations of hot dogs and the crowds enjoyed an expensive hardware fest.In New York we celebrated the people who served in the war. For hours on June 10 more than two million New Yorkers watched people not hardware march up Broadway. Most of the $5 million bill was paid by private donations. New Yorkers could visit a few ships docked in the area and sailors enjoyed the city.Washington has monuments but New York also has an ordinary course of daily existence that never fails to impress visitors. Even after active duty they haven't seen it all. I watched some very alert sailors offer their subway seats to two women. The look on one woman's face reflected the contagious pride from being hosts to these guests.

 0,PhotoHaruki Murakami’s next book “The Strange Library” sounds surreal and experimental even for an author whose work features talking cats giant frogs and malicious miniature people.“The Strange Library” which will be published in the United States by Knopf this December is narrated by a boy who visits a library on his way home from school. An old man takes the boy hostage and forces him to memorize a large number of books. The boy eventually realizes that the man plans to absorb the information he’s memorized by eating his brain. With the help of a strange girl and a man dressed as a sheep the captive devises an escape plan. (Men dressed as sheep have cropped up in Mr. Murakami’s work before.)In a news release announcing the acquisition on Tuesday Knopf’s chairman and editor in chief Sonny Mehta called Mr. Murakami’s 96-page book “as scary and surprising as anything he has ever written.”“The Strange Library” will arrive just three and a half months after Mr. Murakami’s latest novel “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage” which came out in the United States in August. It sold more than a million copies in Japan and is currently No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list for hardcover fiction.“The Strange Library” may feel slight to some Murakami fans especially those coming off his latest 400-plus page novel and his massive 925-page novel “1Q84” which was published in English in 2011. Knopf is fleshing out “The Strange Library” with full-color art throughout in a lavish volume designed by Chip Kidd Knopf’s associate art director. Mr. Kidd said he drew on his own collection of vintage Japanese graphics as inspiration for the design.
 9,Two of the largest retailers have gone to court to block one of the hottest products of the largest credit card company Visa U.S.A. Inc.Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Limited Inc. filed an antitrust suit against Visa arguing that they should not be forced to accept Visa Check cards -- debit cards with the Visa logo that withdraw purchases from the cardholders checking account. Visa insists that retailers that accept its credit cards must also accept the check cards.The suit filed last Friday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn contends that the merchants must pay a fee for check card transactions that is almost as high as the fee on credit card transactions -- typically between 1.5 percent and 3 percent of the purchase price.The two chains contend that the debit cards can be used as if they were credit cards or cash cards of the type used in automated teller machines. But if they are used as cash cards the fees paid by merchants should be 10 cents a transaction the suit says.

 0,"Many national studies on victims of domestic violence tell us that their abusers have threatened to kill threatened to harm or actually harmed their pets as a means of keeping the victim from leaving the relationship" Mr. Baldacci a Democrat said. "With this new law we hope to help remove another tool for emotional and physical violence used by the abuser to exert power and control over their victims."Maine is believed to be the first state with such a law. But the issue has captured attention around the country as police departments domestic-violence programs animal protection societies and state officials become increasingly aware of a link between domestic violence and animal abuse.A new program in Columbus Ohio takes animals of victims of domestic violence and places them in a women's prison where the inmates care for them. In Nashville the city gives such pets a safe haven for up to 30 days. And in St. Louis the Domestic Violence Pet Assistance Program finds foster homes for the animals."There are some batterers who are prone to using coercion and terrorizing tactics who very well know how strongly attached their partner is to the animals in her life" said Frank A. Ascione a psychologist at Utah State University. "It's the dynamic of preying on the love and affection that women often have for the animals in their lives who may be their only source of solace their only source of unconditional love."PhotoIn the late 1990's Dr. Ascione and colleagues interviewed 101 women in shelters for battered women and 120 women who were not victims of domestic violence.They found that 54 percent of the battered women said their abusers had harmed or killed their animals compared with 5 percent of women in the other group. Thirty-four percent of the women whose pets had been both threatened and harmed delayed going to the shelters out of concern for their pets.In 2002 Dr. Ascione said he interviewed 42 men in prison who had had violent relationships with women and found that half of them said they had hurt or killed pets.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Cantara said. He cited a 2002 case in which an abusive husband had beaten the family's cats to death buried them in the backyard and threatened a similar fate for his wife and children.Advertisement Continue reading the main story"To our horror" Mr. Cantara said "that yard was filled with dead Maine pets."Karen Days president of the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence in Ohio said of her work at the Columbus city prosecutor's office: "I had a victim who was in my office and the prosecutor agreed to issue a warrant for the arrest of her partner. But she was just adamant that she be able to go home first and get her dog. When I asked why she said 'When I left him before he started mailing me pieces of my cat to tell me if you don't come back this is what I'm going to continue to do.' "Ms. Days and others said that battered women without children might be the most attached to their pets. But in homes with children there are other concerns Dr. Ascione said.He said that seeing animals abused made "some kids likely to act out what they may have witnessed" while others "get even more strongly attached to their pets" which can be dangerous if the "children start trying to intervene to protect the animals."Jill Morris the public policy director at the National Coalition against Domestic Violence said that she had not heard of another law like Maine's but that some judges had begun to include animals in protective orders.Ms. Days said her organization would be lobbying the Ohio Legislature to make penalties for domestic violence stiffer if animal abuse was involved.Wayne Pacelle president of the Humane Society of the United States said his organization conducted workshops for police departments prosecutors and social workers on the problem."Oftentimes these situations go on for a long period say months or years" Mr. Pacelle said. "We really try to spread the word about this."

 0,Updated 11 p.m. | It was the aviation equivalent of the arrival of the Queen Mary 2 in New York City. Today the double-decker superjumbo Airbus 380 the largest plane ever manufactured landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in its first commercial flight to the United States.The A380 an Emirates Air plane from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates landed around 4:30 p.m. A last-minute shift in wind caused the airport to change the landing path to a much shorter runway (which made the plane very low to the ground when it landed barely clearing the trees).The size and amenities of the A380 are jaw dropping. The first class section has luxury cruise ship features — showers and spas and private suites furnished with personal mini-bars wardrobes and massage system. The plane can fly up to 7456 miles on a full load which carries 14 first class 76 business and 399 economy seats.The plane is so large that airports around the world including Kennedy had to spend an average of $100 million to upgrade the taxiways to accommodate its heft.(An earlier version of this article and the accompanying headline described the A380 as the world’s largest plane. Airbus calls it the world’s largest passenger airliner. But as several readers helpfully noted in their comments there are larger plane though they were not designed for commercial passenger service.)By the time the A380 debuted commercially last year it was already two years late and 50 percent over its initial $12 billion budget. To date there are 202 orders for the A380 from 17 customers. Emirates Air is the largest customer having ordered 58 planes.Airbus said the updated design means the plane is getting 20 percent greater efficiency on a seat-mile basis than any other airplane which is more critical than ever as fuel prices have forced airlines to seek savings in the smallest ways. The Airbus A380 also became the first commercial aircraft to fly with a synthetic liquid fuel processed from gas in a three-hour flight between Filton England and Toulouse France.Kennedy International Airport however is no longer considered the top place to showcase a new plane. The A380 debuted commercially in October 2007 with a Singapore Airlines flight between Singapore and Sydney.But 40 years ago J.F.K. was chosen as the stage for the debut of the Boeing 747 a plane which began the jumbo-jet age and held the record for passenger capacity for four decades until it was eclipsed by the Airbus A380.For its maiden commercial voyage the 747 hurtled down the runway at Kennedy Airport bound for London on Jan. 21 1970. It was a Pan American World Airways flight once an icon of flying chic.J.F.K. which was built originally on some 1000 acres of marshy land long reigned as one the world’s most celebrated airports. But that seems no longer the case. (We already know that at least when it comes to long-haul flights the best airlines are not necessarily the American ones.)Among the top 10 finishers of the World Airport Awards in 2008 were five airports in Asia four in Europe and one in Africa (Cape Town South Africa). The highest-ranked American airport was San Francisco International Airport at No. 11.The top 10 award winners this year were:Hong Kong International Airport Singapore Changi International Airport Incheon International Airport in Seoul South Korea Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia Munich Airport in Germany Kansai International Airport in Osaka Bay Copenhagen Airport in Denmark Zurich Airport in Switzerland Helsinki Vantaa Airport in Finland Cape Town International Airport in South AfricaThe top-ranked airports are thorough modern with features like free Wi-Fi and high-speed train service to downtown.Kennedy Airport once the Jewel of the Jet Age has become the bane of many world travelers. Despite the arrival of the AirTrain there is still no efficient way to get directly from Lower or Midtown Manhattan to the airport in Jamaica Queens. And the airport has been hobbled by a layout in which each airline has its own terminal or ticketing area.Over the past two decades other cities like Atlanta and Denver have built airports that are considered more modern than J.F.K. which as early as 1990 was facing challenges. In recent years the airport has undergone renovations but the construction has sometimes compounded the misery of travel with disruptive barricades rerouted traffic and makeshift quarters.

 9,John E. du Pont the millionaire charged with killing a former Olympic wrestler lost his bid today to be released to a psychiatric institute.In a ruling denying Mr. du Pont's plea to be released on bail for that purpose Judge Patricia H. Jenkins of the Court of Common Pleas cited the defendant's questionable mental state two-day standoff with the police request for a passport wealth and proficiency with guns as reasons for the decision.The judge also found that security at the mental hospital failed to measure up to that provided by the Delaware County Prison the suburban Philadelphia jail where Mr. du Pont has been confined since Jan. 28 when he was arrested in the shooting death of David Schultz 36 at Mr. du Pont's home in Newtown Square.Judge Jenkins said in a seven-page opinion "The commonwealth has met its burden of demonstrating that no combination of bail conditions especially those which rely upon the institute's security provisions can assure the defendant's appearance at trial."
 9,Why India? Why does this distant stiflingly crowded quarrelsome country still ridden with wrenching poverty for hundreds of millions and still unable to free itself of murder and hatred among castes and religions mean so much to the United States - or why should it?Why does it mean so much to me? Long ago I lived here as a correspondent; it was the center of my world. I have lived in other countries and while they remain in mind they become part of my past. Only India still seizes me so emotionally and intellectually so long afterward. I keep thinking about India keep coming back I and those other Americans who felt the pull of India and will for the rest of our lives.For 30 years I have been trying to explain this to friends and to myself. It seems a good time the beginning of a new year a time of re-examination to return to India.I came to find out what India was like after four years of absence. Mostly though I wanted to figure out whether the idea that India was still important to my country and my life was just romanticism and sentimentality arising out of what India had been and I had been or had meaning.
 0,Ashley Gilbertson has taken photographs in emergency rooms throughout the world including in Iraq and Afghanistan. But what he saw during the week he spent in the Maimonides Medical Center emergency room in Brooklyn shocked him.“I’m used to seeing people being taken from an E.R. to the morgue sometimes because of a lack of technology education or even electricity” Mr. Gilbertson said. “ I had never seen people brought back to life on a regular basis. It was so beautiful so powerful but for the doctors and nurses it was just another day in their life.”The photographs that Mr. Gilbertson made of the “whole human experience in one relatively small room in Brooklyn” accompany an article by Lizette Alvarez and a video by Mathew Orr and Ms. Alvarez on Sunday in the Metropolitan section of The Times.Ashley Gilbertson a New York-based photojournalist with the VII Network Photo Agency documents the effects of war. In March “Bedrooms of The Fallen” depicting the bedrooms of service members who died in Iraq and Afghanistan was featured on Lens. In July he wrote about his experiences photographing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s hot line for veterans.
 0,“We had higher expectations than anybody in the N.F.L. I would say — at least anybody that’s willing to talk about it” tight end Dustin Keller said.Much of that swagger begins with Ryan who strode to the lectern afterward with his eyes sunken and red. At the day’s outset the Jets owned a 10.4 percent chance of making the playoffs according to Football Outsiders and needed an unlikely confluence of events in Houston Cincinnati and Denver or Oakland to turn in their favor — but they needed to defeat Miami first. A man with an answer for everything Ryan said Sunday’s loss with pride and postseason hanging in the balance was difficult to explain although in Sanchez’s performance he identified a reasonable starting point.Once celebrated for his ability to perform under pressure Sanchez has committed three turnovers in each of the Jets’ last three games all losses. Even if as Ryan asserted Sanchez was without a doubt the Jets’ “long-term solution” they could hardly be encouraged that his three interceptions Sunday all came on checkdowns to his third or fourth receiver.Two of those came on consecutive fourth-quarter possessions including Marvin Mitchell’s interception that all but clinched Miami’s victory — Jets ball at the Dolphins 10 trailing 16-10 and 3 minutes 10 seconds remaining. In the end Sanchez completed two more passes to Randy Starks a Miami defensive lineman than he did to Holmes.Photo“I’ve got to play better for us to win” Sanchez said.As much as the Jets vowed that this week would be different — for Sanchez for the maligned offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer for unsatisfied fans — it was not. An offense that staggers and sputters for 15 games does not suddenly awaken in the 16th. Though their first touchdown drive was nearly flawless balancing execution with imagination their other six possessions before halftime resulted in four three-and-outs; a field goal drive that entailed four momentum-stalling false-start penalties and two burned timeouts; and Starks’s first interception which led to a Dan Carpenter 58-yard field goal that sliced the Jets’ lead to 10-6. In the second half their four possessions went punt interception interception and touchdown a 10-yarder to Patrick Turner that was rendered meaningless when Miami recovered the onside kick.“All year long” Moore said. “Penalties turnovers lack of focus and attention to detail and things like that. It’s been going on all year. It showed up again this game.”Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.Moore’s appraisal seemed an indictment of some teammates and the coaching staff both of which will be strenuously evaluated. Keller said Ryan in his postgame speech told the Jets to examine themselves as players and teammates. “You can have all the greatest individuals in the world” Keller said “but if they’re not great team players you’re not going to win anything.”Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIf the Jets opt to overhaul their staff Schottenheimer responsible for an underachieving group appears the likeliest candidate to go. His unit actually outgained Miami 374-210 just another confounding statistic in a season loaded with them. The Jets finished with more regular-season road losses (six) than in their previous two years combined. On Sunday they held Miami to 97 net yards in the first half intercepting Matt Moore twice but had all of 10 points to show for it.That output was not nearly enough not on a day when the Jets’ defense failed them in a way not fully seen since Tim Tebow’s stirring game-winning drive in Denver in Week 11. Leading 10-6 midway through the third quarter the Jets had the Dolphins pinned deep in their territory. And then Moore engineered a drive that left them dumbstruck and desperate converting all six third-down opportunities. Taking over at their own 6 the Dolphins marched 94 yards in 21 plays consuming 12:29 to take a 13-10 lead. In response Sanchez threw an interception and the Jets’ collapse was all but complete.Not that they would agree but missing the playoffs might have been the best thing for the Jets. It forces them to examine their roster the staff and the schemes instead of perceiving the team as being merely one victory from the Super Bowl. That was a year ago. These Jets had too many flaws to be champions and as was revealed Sunday too many flaws to make the postseason as well.

 0,At the Calvary Chapel in Fort Lauderdale an evangelical church with a racially diverse congregation a guest speaker Rick Green a former Texas lawmaker who often talks to conservative groups told 3500 worshipers to "vote for righteousness." He directed people to "voter guides" in the hallway. One published by the Christian Coalition claimed that Mr. Kerry supported abortion and gay marriage. (Mr. Kerry has said he opposes same-sex marriage.) Books including "America's Godly Heritage" and "Is America One Nation Under God?" were on sale. On her way out Maureen Crocco 58 said of Mr. Bush "This is a man who lives out his faith and I don't see anything wrong with that."At the First Assembly of God Church an evangelical congregation in Des Moines the Rev. John M. Palmer told 800 worshipers: "I pray that God gives wisdom to every voter making choices and that they will support individuals who uphold the sanctity of life. To choose individuals who are committed to biblical ways and who will lead this nation with a biblical perspective."A brochure in the program asked "Why Must Christians Vote?" and quoted Scripture in answer: "When the godly are in authority the people rejoice. But when the wicked are in power they groan."Kelli Russell 17 said she was for Mr. Bush. "He believes what I believe and I support what he has done in office" she said.In Denver it was the Day of the Dead at the Cameron Church a United Methodist congregation that honors loved ones and ancestors on the last Sunday of October on or close to Halloween. The altar was crowded with mementos and music to "wake the spirits" was played. Most of the worshipers though not all were Kerry supporters and some wore buttons proclaiming their allegiance.But the senior pastor the Rev. Bill Kirton was nonpartisan in his sermon focusing on a scriptural beast in the Book of Daniel. "If you are a liberal you are a beast and if you are a conservative you are a beast to somebody" he said. He advised looking past the election to what he called things that matter.In Cleveland the Rev. C. Jay Matthews pastor of the Mount Sinai Baptist Church a black congregation recalled a personal political journey that had taken him from Mr. Bush to Mr. Kerry. "I have supported this president and I've been a leader in promoting his faith-based initiatives" Mr. Matthews said. He even met with the Republican national chairman Ed Gillespie on how to raise black votes. But his congregation did not go along and he had second thoughts as the campaign in Ohio became bitter with negative attacks.
 0,Saturday night Marsha and I attended a Nine Inch Nails tribute concert for relief and emergency workers as part of the Voodoo Music Experience an annual New Orleans festival. The concert was held on the banks of the Mississippi River in weather that turned crisp after darkness fell.Earlier as the setting sun silhouetted tankers and container ships gliding down the river toward the Gulf we had been entranced by Worms Union a local punk drum ensemble one of whose members wore the most commonly seen T-shirt at the festival. It featured just above a musket a skull emblazoned with a fleur-de-lis; circling the skull and gun was a simple message: “Defend New Orleans.”If there’s anything left for me to say after my 15 columns and videos this past month about my hometown it’s to echo that plea: Defend New Orleans.The city is in jeopardy. At dinner last night a knowledgeable historian and friend who has been trying to get a fix on the actual population of New Orleans today told me that the estimate he keeps hearing is 150000 people during the day and only 50000 at night. That means if those numbers are accurate the city has a resident population only one-tenth its size before Hurricane Katrina hit two months ago.Many have compared the tragedy here to the events of 9/11 but as terrible as that day was for America and the families that lost loved ones it resulted in the closing of a neighborhood in New York and a building in Washington. My son then a student at Columbia University was back in class a few days later. The collapse of defective levees here on the other hand led to the forced evacuation of an entire city. Our universities will not open again until January. Basic governmental services are still being restored two months later. Much of the population is homeless and either jobless or without salaries. What happened in New Orleans is a catastrophe of so large a scale it is difficult to comprehend the extent of the upheaval.As has now been widely documented all this suffering was engendered by the incompetence of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. As an engineer on an L.S.U. team researching the collapse of the city’s levees concluded the levee design the corps chose to use “could never work.” But having lost our houses cars jobs and possessions to a needless flood for which a government agency bears responsibility we now face an administration ideologically opposed to the use of government to serve the public good. The grandiose promises of reconstruction aid made by President Bush before St. Louis Cathedral in a dramatically lit nighttime speech to the nation turn out to have been nothing more than lies by a weakened politician. It is now expected that what aid we get will be funds redirected from existing poverty programs and unlike any other federal disaster aid in history we will be made to pay it all back.I have been overwhelmed by the response to my columns this past month and I apologize for not having been able to respond personally to all the readers around the world who sent their sympathy encouragement and gratitude. (I was especially touched by the bookshop owner in Maine who offered to replace some of the books I had lost and another reader who tried to locate a place for us to stay when Marsha and I were taking cold showers in the daycare center where we first slept upon returning to New Orleans.) Many readers expressed their shame and outrage at the performance of the federal government in responding to the crisis here.I hope all those readers and everyone who loves the Big Easy will do whatever they can to keep attention focused on what happens down here over the next year and to support however they can the rebuilding of this great city. We New Orleanians can’t defend New Orleans by ourselves; we need your help.

 9,WHAT price fashion?

He has headed his own couture house for the last four years.Instead of the beaded exoticisms that sent the audiences applauding in Italy this summer Valentino's collection for Bloomingdale's emphasizes the kind of clothes that the business girl or housewife can wear all through the day. Slender and shapely they curve in toward the body in front and hang straight at the back.

 9,''It's impossible to talk about any other alternatives without one side accusing you of being a traitor and having a hidden agenda'' Professor MacCoun said.The polarization has been illustrated by the refusal of Senator Jesse Helms to let the Foreign Relations Committee that he leads consider the nomination of William F. Weld as United States Ambassador to Mexico. Senator Helms Republican of North Carolina accuses Mr. Weld the former Massachusetts Governor of being soft on drugs because he favors making medicinal marijuana available for seriously ill people. In fact Mr. Weld as a Federal prosecutor put drug traffickers behind bars.The 34 professionals advocating a new look at drug policy plan to announce 14 ''principles for practical drug policies'' at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday. Their move constitutes the first attempt in years to bring pragmatism as well as civility to what has degenerated into a shouting match.''It's being done to make clear to people that the argument between the legalizers and the drug warriors isn't where the action is if what you're really trying to do is reduce the damage that drugs do to American society'' said Mark A. R. Kleiman a professor of public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''What we'd like to do is make it politically safe to say something sensible about drug policy.''Though the people who have signed the statement are generally known for their work on issues like drug addiction most have not publicly spoken out about drug policy before. To avoid partisanship none of the prominent personalities on either side of the drug debate were invited to sign the declaration which also avoids much of the language of the current heated debate. For example it speaks of reducing the damage of drugs to society rather than ''harm reduction'' a phrase that connotes cutting down on the harm addicts do to themselves.

 0,WASHINGTON — For decades brand-name and generic drug companies have fought each other in Congress at international trade negotiations and in court. So when the world’s largest generic drug company moved this year to join the powerful trade association for producers of brand-name medicines pharmaceutical lobbyists were in a swivet.The trade group the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America known as PhRMA is plunging into battles over drug prices here and in many state capitols. And the request from the generic company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is raising eyebrows in PhRMA’s secretive councils.Some brand-name drug companies have expressed alarm at the prospect that Teva will join their ranks a move some see as tantamount to allowing a spy into the fold.If PhRMA “broadens its membership to include the world’s largest generic company the association’s emphasis on innovation will be diluted” Carlos Alban an executive vice president of the brand-name drug maker AbbVie wrote in late May in a letter to the board of the trade association.

 9,As Governor Cuomo finished an impassioned speech this week at Princeton University on the plight of the country's poor a freshman stood up to ask a question.''Governor'' the freshman asked ''how do we go about ending poverty without either raising taxes tremendously or increasing spending dramatically? In concrete terms what do you propose we do?''Mr. Cuomo stood silent for a moment looking out over McCosh Hall and its banners of ''Go Mario!'' and ''86 Albany/88 D.C.'' Then after a five-minute response in which he continued his attacks on the policies of the Reagan Administration he finally acknowledged that in fact he had no specific alternatives to propose.To be sure he said he is working on some but they are not ready.After more than two years of widely publicized speeches by the Governor criticizing President Reagan's policies Cuomo aides acknowledge privately that it is becoming awkward that he has nothing detailed to offer as an alternative. And even the Governor a possible Presidential candidate in 1988 has begun to acknowledge the problem.

 9,After 23 years on the Supreme Court bench Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun stepped down today in a simple court ceremony.Moments after the Justices issued the term's final six decisions two of which were written by Justice Blackmun Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist read a brief letter from all the Court members paying tribute to their retiring colleague.But the letter included a remark that some in the courtroom saw as double edged. The Chief Justice referred to a Blackmun opinion he has criticized the one establishing the constitutional right to an abortion saying: "Your opinions have covered a wide range of the issues that come before the Court. You are undoubtedly best known for having authored the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade in 1973 but that distinction should not obscure the many other important issues on which you have spoken for the Court."Justice Blackmun who is planning to move to Jacksonville Fla. although he will maintain an office here responded by quoting the retirement letter of Justice William O. Douglas who compared serving with his colleagues to being an outdoorsman with its "occasional long and strenuous portages and the last night's and the last morning's campfires."
 9,“WHEN a man buys a horse” said Mike Ryba “he takes mighty good care of him. The man knows he has an investment to protect and so he turns that horse over to trainer groom stablehands and exercise boys. But big league ball clubs are much too careless with their investments. They sink millions of dollars into bonus players their stars of the future and send them to the minors where one man the manager has to be everything to everybody.”Mike is normally a placid individual but there was a faint trace of bitterness in his voice as he talked in St. Petersburg a week or so ago. He is nearing the end of a temporary scouting assignment with the St. Louis Cardinals and would love to latch on with some ball club in any capacity. He has matchless qualifications too because of his remarkable versatility.A slugging first baseman for St. Francis College of Loretto Pa. he was signed by the Cards in 1925 as a catcher. He finished his big league career in 1946 when he pitched for the Red Sox in the World Series. He has played every position on the diamond and is the only man in history who ever pitched and caught in both major leagues.“Last year I managed Cedar Rapids for the Reds” said Mike. “But the minors keep shrinking. Bill DeWitt told me he liked my work but he was forced to cut down. I had 35 kids out there and I could only suit up 19. So the other 16 had to sit in the stands during games. I would have the 16 at the ball park every morning for practice. When we went on the road I'd leave the 16 in charge of the oldest.

 9,To the Editor:American consumers now pay more than twice what they should for sugar! But Senator Daniel K. Inouye has sponsored a provision in the 1989 appropriations bill for agriculture that would further subsidize a few large sugar refiners under the guise of helping the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries and the Philippines.United States sugar refiners would purchase raw sugar at the domestic price (again more than two times higher than the world price) from Caribbean Basin producers and the Philippines. Domestic refiners would refine and export the sugar to the world market at the substantially lower world price. The taxpayer would then compensate domestic refiners for the difference.This is a business subsidy in its worst form because the domestic sugar program which artificially props up prices by virtually precluding sugar imports from other countries already costs the United States consumer nearly $3 billion a year!And this sugar export enchancement program would cost taxpayers $140 million more a year with the subsidy going to about 10 major refiners.

 0,The early estimates prepared by the members of Congress involved in the fund's creation are they admit preliminary. But they agreed that the fund was structured to compensate families roughly in line with what they might expect from a court award. In cases of death and severe injury such awards routinely exceed $1 million. ''Those kinds of numbers were clearly being contemplated'' said one official involved in the negotiations.The fund's framers said their aim was to offer families an avenue for relief that would be faster and more certain than litigation. But the concerns already raised about how it will operate and whom it will serve suggest it may need refining.The emerging questions and unhappiness about the fund were in effect born in compromises made to achieve its passage according to interviews with a half-dozen Republican and Democratic participants in the process.The basic architecture of the fund was designed in less than 24 hours with the final passages written at 4 a.m. on Friday Sept. 21 just hours before the measure was passed by both chambers. Negotiators for both parties said the rush was driven by the demands of airline executives who had bluntly warned that they would be out of business without immediate financial aid and protection from lawsuits.Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt had made it clear that there would be no deal for the airlines without compensation for victims. But a disagreement about how best to construct such a system of compensation surfaced.A plan proposed by the White House would have had all victim claims consolidated for trial in federal court in Manhattan with the government stepping in to pay claims only after the airlines' insurance was exhausted. If victims failed to prove who was to blame for their losses they would get nothing.Ultimately though the real wrangling over the nature of the fund took place when leaders of the Senate and House met in the offices of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert on the night of Sept. 20.

 0,LOUISVILLE Ky. — The best show at this year’s Humana Festival of New American Plays which runs here through Sunday had an unbearable start. The first 40 minutes of Mara Nelson-Greenberg’s “Do You Feel Anger?” felt so gratingly forced it was hard to see where the story could go. But there was a payoff and a great one.In this dark comedy directed by Margot Bordelon an “empathy coach” named Sofia (Tiffany Villarin) is sent out to train the employees of a debt-collection agency. Ms. Nelson-Greenberg doubles down on the absurdism: Sofia’s parents nickname her “little spider” because she was born with eight arms while Eva (Megan Hill) an agency employee cannot remember the name of the boyfriend she just broke up with. We are stuck in a collegiate version of Ionesco and it is stultifying.Eventually however the real subject emerges: the way some men feel threatened by women and demand that love and work be on their terms — or else.Jon (Dennis William Grimes) is dumbfounded when he learns about menstruation; Howie (Amir Wachterman) has a meltdown and stops only when Sofia tells him that yes he’s funny: “I think I just didn’t understand the joke” she explains.
 0,Stan Honda/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIntroduced on Thursday: 2011 Subaru WRX STI sedanIs it real? Travis Pastrana wannabes rejoice: The wing is back! Just when enthusiasts thought that continual upgrades to the “regular” WRX sedan (including its own boy-racer wide-body treatment) would negate the STI’s raison d’être Subaru renews its commitment to clandestine street racers everywhere with this addition to its ultimate-performance model line (which includes also a five-door hatch).What they said: “The continuous evolution and development of the WRX STI is driven by the strong loyal and vocal support from thousands of enthusiastic owners of this exciting high-performance vehicle” said Tom Doll executive vice president and chief operating officer of Subaru of America. “The 2011 four-door WRX STI will expand the appeal of this iconic performance model to a wider range of driving enthusiasts.”What they didn’t say: Does Subaru expect that “wider range of driving enthusiasts” to include golfers? Well please note the luggage compartment in the WRX STI will accommodate three golf bags. Who buys a WRX for golf? You buy them — and embarrass Golfs.What makes it tick? The 2011 WRX STI sedan as well the hatch that has been the only other STI body style offered since a 2008 redesign will offer a high-boost 305-horsepower turbocharged/intercooled 4-cylinder Boxer engine mated to a 6-speed manual. To maximize handling – beyond the improvements Subaru says it has made to the system over all for this model – the driver can select among “Intelligent” “Sport” and “Sport Sharp” automatic driving modes; and there’s a manual mode with six driver-selectable differential locking settings. (Use responsibly.) Rocket fuel recommended.How much? How soon? A base price around $35000 is expected when it goes on sale this summer just in time for tire-melting season.How does it look? These things aren’t meant to look pretty are they? Good thing because in everyday driving the new picnic table/rear spoiler would look um juvenile. The imitation rally racer (Subaru no longer competes in the WRX World Rally Championship) wide-body panels and the new 18-inch wheels and tires complete the out-of-its-element look.

Worn down on the inside barely able to get free on the perimeter Jackson the young star of the Australian team resorted to the only move she had left against the Americans a move straight out of a heated schoolyard:She pulled someone's hair.With four minutes left in the gold medal game tonight and while jostling under the basket the frustrated 19-year-old Jackson plucked Lisa Leslie's ponytail sending the hairpiece into a row of photographers. Leslie was embarrassed but not enough to hold her tongue on the way up the floor.''I told her she could have the hair; I'll take the gold'' said Leslie the United States center.And the Americans spoiled the teenager's party by routing Australia 76-54 to win their second straight Olympic basketball gold medal in front of 15000 people who had wanted to see them put in their places.Leslie and her teammates dedicated the game to Teresa Edwards the 36-year-old five-time Olympian who is retiring.The United States women turned in a virtuoso big-game performance. Leslie was a force underneath scoring 15 points and gathering 9 rebounds using her sinewy frame and footwork to make Jackson work inside. Edwards and Dawn Staley moved the ball on offense and pressured the Australians on defense. Sheryl Swoopes (14 points) ran the floor Natalie Williams (15 points 9 rebounds) and Yolanda Griffith (13 points 12 rebounds) muscled inside and everyone but the injured Chamique Holdsclaw got off the bench to celebrate in the final minutes.

 0,Industrial production was unchanged in June from July as declines in output of semiconductors and cars offset increases in production of steel and paper. Still the government said it expected factory output to rebound in the months ahead forecasting that production would increase 1.5 percent in August and 0.6 percent in September. July's production figure is the latest of a string of data that points to a slowing of Japan's recovery. Last week the government reported that the unemployment rate rose for the first time this year increasing to 4.9 percent in July from 4.6 percent in June. Todd Zaun (NYT)

Mukasey who is presiding in the case set a new trial date of Dec. 5 to give time to newly appointed lawyers to prepare their cases for the defense.Judge Mukasey's decision was made necessary in part by his disqualification last week of the firm of William M.

The judge accepted a Government motion to disqualify the Kunstler & Kuby firm on the grounds that they had a conflict of interest.Mr. Elgabrowny has engaged a new defense lawyer Anthony Ricco who last week told Judge Mukasey that he would need two or three months to prepare his case.

 0,Representatives from Consolidated Edison and the union that covers nearly 9000 workers at the utility returned to the bargaining table on Tuesday morning after a three-day cooling-off period. Instead of digging into the latest counterproposal from Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America the two sides first debated the size of the negotiation table and who should have a seat according to a union spokesman Joe Flaherty who likened the fracas to the Paris peace talks in the 1970s when North Vietnam the United States and other parties argued about the table.Talks finally got under way around 10 a.m. an hour late Mr. Flaherty said. The new deadline for talks is tonight at 11:59 p.m.There was a notable addition to the table this morning: Barbara C. Deinhardt the chairwoman of the New York State Employment Relations Board. She is in effect serving as a proxy for Gov. David A. Paterson who called for the cooling off period late Saturday night after it became clear that the two sides were not going to reach an agreement before the Sunday morning deadline.Ms. Deinhardt joined Hezekiah Brown the private mediator chosen by both sides last week but who was unable to bring the sides together before.Mr. Brown is the retired former head of State Employment Relations Board under former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.The two sides have been arguing over proposals by Con Edison to raise wages by about 1.5 percent to create 401(k)-style pensions for new workers and changes to the pension and health care plans according to union representatives.

 0,Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.The first manned balloon flight took place in France during the early 1780s and not surprisingly people began thinking of how to turn the balloon into an implement of war. Within a few years the French army was using observation balloons in battle and Benjamin Franklin even suggested that balloons might actually be used to convey soldiers into the fray. In 1849 the Austrian high command sent some 200 unmanned balloons laden with timed explosives over Venice. Unfortunately the wind shifted carrying them back over the hapless Austrians.Ballooning caught on in the United States as well and by the beginning of the Civil War there were several budding “aeronauts” as the balloonists styled themselves anxious to place their crafts and skill at the disposal of the Federal forces including an ambitious and highly capable young New Englander named Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine Lowe.Library of CongressA self-educated former magician’s assistant Lowe had relatively little experience with balloons when the war began having only built his first craft in 1858. Three years later he set out to make history by navigating the first manned transatlantic balloon flight. He lifted off in Cincinnati in late April 1861 and made it as far as South Carolina where the vagaries of wind forced him down – smack in the heart of the newly minted Confederacy. Lowe was immediately arrested by surprised rebels but they released him when they determined – falsely as events would prove – that he posed no threat.Library of CongressLowe realized the value of what he’d seen from above of rebel troop preparations. Through political connections he finessed a June 11 meeting with President Lincoln and offered the chief executive a demonstration. Six days later Lincoln watched as Lowe in the company of officials from the American Telegraph Company soared to some 500 feet above Washington’s Columbia Armory in the hydrogen-filled balloon Enterprise. Lowe ever the showman had rigged the balloon with a telegraph key and wired the president from aloft “I have pleasure in sending you this first dispatch ever telegraphed from an aerial station …”Lincoln a lifelong fan of new technology and desperately seeking an advantage over the enemy was sold. In a subsequent introductory letter to Winfield Scott commander of the army he wrote “General this is my friend Professor Lowe who is organizing an aeronautics corps and who is to be its chief. I wish you would facilitate his work in every way.” Lincoln authorized the creation of the Balloon Corps which was staffed by civilians and attached to the Army’s Corps of Topographical Engineers. Lowe was placed in charge at a salary of $10 a day. Lowe went to work on Aug. 2 1861 eventually constructing seven hydrogen balloons of cord-wrapped and varnished silk cloth. He also designed and built portable hydrogen gas generators for service in the field making his balloons highly mobile.Lowe however was not the only man who wanted to be the Union’s chief aeronaut. One of the first orders for a military balloon went to an experienced Pennsylvania-born pilot John Wise. For his first – and as it turned out last – assignment Wise was charged with observing the enemy at the Battle of First Bull Run. Unfortunately his craft caught in tree branches en route to Manassas rendering it useless. By this time it was too late to contribute to the Union effort during the battle but perhaps to show off his superior ballooning skills Lowe went aloft after the fray impressing the Union brass with his observations of the victorious rebels’ troop movements.At Arlington on Sept. 24 Lowe ascended in the balloon Union to over 1000 feet marked enemy troop movements in Falls Church (some three miles away) and relayed the information to the ground by telegraph. The ensuing Union barrage represented the first time in military history that artillery had been accurately used against an unseen enemy. Lowe also devised a method of launching a balloon from the water by rigging a “flight deck” on a converted coal barge – thus creating the world’s first aircraft carrier. He successfully used this system on rivers during the entire Peninsula Campaign. Reportedly the Yankee aeronauts were so successful in marking rebel activities that some Confederate units banned campfires at night and created dummy camps to deceive the pilots.Related Disunion Highlights Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. See the Highlights »Throughout the war debate raged among aeronauts as to whether balloons should remain in a fixed position or allowed to float on favorable winds. One of Lowe’s competitors a brassy young New York State native named John La Mountain (or La Montain) floated his balloon directly over enemy positions near Ft. Monroe Va. sketched what he saw and caught an air current back to the Union lines. Generally however balloons were kept tethered – or “captive” – when sent aloft held earthbound by rows of straining soldiers.The reasoning was simple: besides providing an irresistible target for enemy (and in some cases friendly) fire an unattached balloon was at the mercy of the winds and as Lowe himself had found wind currents were neither predictable nor fully understood at the time. The Confederates discovered this for themselves when they created a much-abridged version of Lowe’s Balloon Corps. Using multi-colored silk that according to legend had been designated for the manufacture of women’s attire the rebels constructed two hot-air “silk dress balloons.” One escaped its tether floated directly to the Yankees and was captured. (The other was taken by the enemy as well when the rebel tugboat that was towing it ran aground.)While serving with the Topographical Engineers the Balloon Corps was also invaluable in creating maps of the local terrain. The importance and lack of accurate maps during the Civil War cannot be exaggerated. When the war began neither side had current or reliable information on the terrain – a problem that was neither easily nor speedily resolved. In 1862 Gen. George McClellan observed “Correct local maps were not to be found and the country though known in its general features we found to be inaccurately described in essential particulars….” Frequently both armies relied almost exclusively on the intelligence gathered by scouts – and no terrestrial observer could come close to the intelligence available to the Balloon Corps.Library of CongressDespite the Balloon Corps’ many contributions throughout numerous battles and campaigns Army officers always viewed it with ambivalence. Despite the active support and encouragement of such highly placed generals as McClellan and Irvin McDowell a large number of officers – often far from the front and unfamiliar with the workings of the Corps – tended to see the balloons as useless and the pilots as a gaggle of unruly overpaid civilians. The military didn’t know how best to use the crafts or for that matter where to house them.The Army transferred the balloons to the Army Corps of Engineers in early 1863 and placed a non-aeronaut Capt. Cyrus B. Comstock in charge. He had no use for Lowe or his creations and wasted no time in cutting the Corps’ budget and drastically reducing Lowe’s salary. Lowe quit in disgust in May and by early August bereft of both adequate funding and Lowe’s inspired leadership the Balloon Corps itself was no more.The reappearance of observation balloons in American warfare would have to wait until World War I during which the United States military created the Aeronaut Badge to be worn by balloon pilots. The insignia which would in time become known as the Balloon Pilot Badge featured a winged balloon across which were embossed the letters “U.S.” Thaddeus Lowe would have been pleased.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Ron Soodalter is a journalist and member of the board of directors of the Abraham Lincoln Institute.

 0,An unexpected issue in the 2012 election is whether or not rank-and-file Americans should aspire to a college degree. Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum have both made comments about higher education that could come back to haunt them in a general election.“President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob” Santorum told a Tea Party meeting in Troy Mich. on Feb. 25. “I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image.”Romney the all-but-certain nominee was blunt when speaking in March at a metal assembly plant in Youngstown Ohio: “It would be popular for me to stand up and say I’m going to give you government money to pay for your college but I’m not going to promise that.”There is a partisan logic to the Republican hostility to higher education: the well-educated — a reliable source of conservative support as recently as the 1980s — have been moving steadily toward the Democratic Party. In a head-to-head contest a March 26 McClatchy-Marist Poll shows Romney ahead of Obama 47-42 among those without college degrees while Obama leads Romney 51-42 among those with them. Similarly those without college degrees lean toward voting for Republican congressional candidates 49-40 while those with them lean toward Democrats 46-44.Not only are Democrats making gains among the better-educated but these voters are becoming a larger share of the electorate. Exit polls show the growth of the college-educated voting bloc.In 1984 those with college and advanced degrees made up 35.3 percent of the electorate. Reagan’s strongest margins were among the college educated who backed him over Walter F. Mondale by a crushing 62.7-36.9 margin. Among all those with both college and advanced degrees Reagan won 58.7 percent a landslide margin.Jump to 2008. Even though those with college degrees made up 27.9 percent of the population that year they cast 45 percent of the presidential vote. These voters register and go to the polls in substantially higher numbers than the less well educated.By 2008 the Republican advantage of the early 1980s among voters with a college degree or higher had disappeared. Barack Obama carried this demographic with 54.1 percent. He beat McCain 50-48 among those with bachelor’s degrees and by a decisive 58-40 among the 17 percent of the 2008 electorate with post-graduate degrees.The shifting allegiance of the better-educated – together with the growth of such pro-Democratic constituencies as single women Hispanics and African-Americans — has been a crucial factor in the revival of the Democratic Party as a fully competitive force in presidential elections. The party’s gains have in many respects made up for losses among white working class voters.In the 1970s and 1980s the defection of Reagan Democrats gave the Republican Party a clear edge in national contests; by the 1990s and 2000s the once reliably Republican affluent suburbs surrounding cities like New York and Philadelphia had moved in the opposite direction empowering the Democratic Party to win the White House in 1992 1996 and 2008 and the popular vote if not the presidency in 2000. By contrast in the 1970s and 1980s Republican presidential candidates won on average 59 percent of the upscale suburban vote.The gains the Democrats made were concentrated in one major segment of the well-educated: professionals — salaried employees in schools and colleges social workers the arts the natural and social sciences knowledge/information workers “symbol analysts” “creatives” and so forth.Andrew Gelman director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University has illustrated the voting trends among different job classifications in his book “Red State Blue State Rich State Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do.”The graph below shows how professionals voted compared to the entire electorate.courtesy of Andrew GelmanAt the same time the percentage of the population employed in professional jobs has been growing steadily from 16.4 percent of the workforce in 1970 to 22.2 percent in 2010.While Democratic gains among those with undergraduate and advanced degrees have clearly benefitted the party there are costs.The replacement of working-class whites with upscale professionals has turned the Democratic coalition into an alliance with a built-in class division. Instead of representing the bottom half of the income distribution as it did from the 1930s to the 1960s the party has become bifurcated with roughly 60 percent of the base vote cast by relatively poor and heavily minority voters and much of the remainder provided by relatively affluent social and cultural liberals.While constituting a minority the relatively upscale wing clearly dominates party policy and provides the majority of the activists who run campaigns serve as delegates to the convention and have become the core of the party’s donor base.The leverage of the highly-educated wing is reflected in the priority placed on the culture war issues that are of key importance to this wing. Support for abortion rights and gay rights for example is an essential litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates. There is no parallel demand that candidates protect and expand food stamps Medicaid or other means-tested programs for the poor.On the Republican side of the aisle the aversion to federally funded scholarship aid – as demonstrated for example in the budget passed last week by the Republican House — has significant consequences for the party’s core supporters.The children of the white working class are in need of financial support to pay for tuition at a two or four-year colleges as a path to upward mobility. The overwhelming majority of Pell Grants 63.3 percent go to low income whites while 11.8 percent goes to African-American students 13.2 percent to Hispanics 6.8 percent to Asian-Americans and the rest to other groups.This year Romney will need to win by a wide margin among those for whom access to post-secondary education is a key issue — particularly white men whose wages have stagnated or eroded more than those of women.The following chart put together by the M.I.T. economists Daron Acemoglu and David Autor shows what has happened to the wages of men with various levels of education working full time (high school dropout high school graduate some college college graduate greater than college).courtesy of David AutorFor men without college degrees 1972-3 marked — in economic terms — the best year of their lives and earnings adjusted for inflation have gone downhill over the forty years since then. Only men with college degrees and especially those with post-graduate degrees did better in 2008 than they had in 1973.A central theme of the Romney campaign is that he intends to replace the Democratic “entitlement state” with the restoration of America as “a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom.”In the fight for Republican primary votes it may make political sense for Santorum to mock higher education as the province of liberal elitists and for Romney to display deficit-consciousness by declaring his opposition to government assistance for college tuition.In the general election Romney faces a far tougher sell. Federal aid to education has strong bipartisan support among voters with more than 60 percent of Republicans and Democrats opposed to making any cuts according to a Gallup poll from Jan. 26 2011.Romney’s refusal to promise that he will “give you government money to pay for your college” is a risky approach to courting ambitious lower income voters. Democrats see Romney setting a trap for himself and have already begun to lay the general election groundwork.The increasing salience of education provides Democrats with an effective means of countering the problem of an underperforming economy as President Obama demonstrated in a speech on Feb. 27: “We can’t allow higher education to be a luxury in this country. It’s an economic imperative that every family in America has to be able to afford.”Romney in turn appears to recognize that he has stepped onto treacherous terrain. His Web site now declares: “Post-secondary education cannot become a luxury for the few; instead all students should have the opportunity to attend a college that best suits their needs. Whether it is public or private traditional or online college must be available and affordable.”Still Romney does not specify which actions he would have the federal government take to prevent post-secondary education from becoming a luxury for the few. Instead his Web site trumpets the potential for initiatives at the state level where Romney speaking as a former governor himself “knows what can be accomplished when governors are empowered to reform their education systems.”Thomas B. Edsall a professor of journalism at Columbia University is the author of the book “The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics” which was published in January.

 9,Prof. William Albert Niering an internationally recognized expert on the ecology of wetlands and tidal marshes died Monday in New London where he had just addressed the incoming class of 2003 at Connecticut College. He was 75 and lived in Gales Ferry Conn.He collapsed on the campus outside Palmer Auditorium and was pronounced dead on arrival at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital the college said.Dr. Niering the Lucretia L. Allyn Professor of Botany at the school and its longest-tenured faculty member was one of the first small group of scientists to realize that wetlands play vital ecological roles and are not something to be drained and filled in. He contributed to the understanding of the role of marshes in flood drainage water filtration and providing a spawning habitat for fish and other ocean life.His botanical research varied from the vegetation of Connecticut's remaining natural spaces to wetlands ecology from the dynamics of the vegetation of Pacific atolls to the flora of the desert Southwest.
 9,LONDON—An exhibition opened in London last week to celebrate the achievements and ambitions of a revolutionary theater company which dedicated itself to breaking down the boundaries between the arts — between performers and audience between poetry and dance between painting and music. In one of its productions the dancers sat in the stalls while a dozen male customers in full evening dress disrobed on the stage. The impresario and choreographer drove in from the wings in a wheezing battered old car. And in the intermission a psychedelic film was projected on a screen. In another production the company's male star appeared nude. View Full Article in Timesmachine »

 0,WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — I heeded this puzzle’s 62 Across advice before I even knew what it was. If HASTE MAKES WASTE then my solving performance on this puzzle was pretty frugal. It wasn’t that I preferred to plod it was just the pace the puzzle imposed. Of course that very same HASTE MAKES WASTE entry serves as a hint to the puzzle’s theme the idea being that if you change the H in HASTE it makes WASTE.The Details:Regarding the theme BASE WIT in the center of the puzzle was a nice extra touch. And an amusing one as well. “Bread in a jar perhaps” was a great clue for TIPS and “Big Indian” had me scratching my head before discovering it was RAJA. Did you know LYNDA Carter a k a TV’s Wonder Woman was a former Miss World USA? I didn’t but the next time it comes up in conversation I’ll be armed. I’m not sure if that’s a good or a bad thing.“Pikake garland” was something new for LEI which is always a good thing. In case you’re wondering pikake isn’t a Hawaiian city it’s a species of jasmine. Along with plumeria it’s the most common flower used to make a lei. Maile vines and leaves might also be used especially if you’ve got hula dancing or getting married scheduled for the afternoon.Looking for a way to share the puzzle with your children? Here’s a word search game they can play using your completed puzzle: Find AL 16 times in the grid reading forward backward up down or diagonally.

 9,With the clock ticking down until Election Day and new polls showing that her re-election remains in doubt Gov. Christine Todd Whitman turned her attention today to some of her softer areas of support giving a speech on personal responsibility that seemed intended to appease social conservatives in the Republican Party and expressing her solidarity with minority voters who traditionally favor Democrats.Mrs. Whitman whose positions in favor of abortion and gay rights have alienated some fellow Republicans told hundreds of teen-agers at Cedar Grove High School in Cedar Grove that she wanted to begin a dialogue with children in New Jersey about the importance of choosing between right and wrong.Alluding to a number of widely publicized crimes by teen-agers in New Jersey over the last year Mrs. Whitman said ''We as adults have not been doing a very good job of communicating to you and the people coming up after you about consequences and responsibility.''When you make a decision and take an action there are going to be consequences'' she said.Later Mrs. Whitman stood on a dais outside the Oak Avenue School in Orange a relatively poor city that has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold and accepted endorsements from several local black leaders.

 0,Until last week there was near total silence from companies like Netflix Disney and WarnerMedia. Then Mr. Sarandos the chief content officer at Netflix said that his company would “rethink our entire investment in Georgia” if the law went into effect. Robert A. Iger Disney’s chief executive said in an interview with Reuters that it would be “very difficult” to continue to make movies in Georgia if the law became a reality.WarnerMedia said in a statement on Thursday “We will watch the situation closely and if the new law holds we will reconsider Georgia as the home to any new productions.”Mr. Chernin and his company’s movie chief Jenno Topping were outspoken from the outset saying in a statement in mid-May that Georgia had “declared war on the rights and freedom of its women.”Chernin Entertainment which has produced films like “The Greatest Showman” “Hidden Figures” and “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” has two major projects set for production in Georgia. One is a trilogy of films based on the “Fear Street” novels by R.L. Stine. The other is a television drama called “P-Valley” that is headed to Starz. In his fund-raising email Mr. Chernin elaborated on his decision announced on May 15 to continue with those plans rather than look for other shooting locales.“Firing workers most of whom oppose this legislation does not seem like a just response” Mr. Chernin wrote adding “Taking action against only Georgia felt like a highly narrow and targeted response to a national battle. Abandoning and isolating parts of the country that we don’t agree with strikes me as a dangerous response.”Other Hollywood figures including Ron Howard J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele have said they will keep production going in Georgia while donating to organizations like the A.C.L.U. and Fair Fight Georgia. Fair Fight Georgia is led by Stacey Abrams the Democrat who became a national liberal icon after nearly defeating Gov. Brian Kemp in the most recent election.“Peter Chernin really has heeded the call in a way very few in Hollywood have over the years” Mr. Romero the A.C.L.U.’s executive director said on Monday night.

 0,Nick Kurczewski for The New York TimesIntroduced last Thursday: 2011 Kia Optima sedanIs it real? Yes. Take off the badges and you could mistake the 2011 Kia Optima for a European luxury car.What they said: Kia should mean more than bargain-prices and a strong warranty according to Peter Schreyer Kia’s chief design officer. Speaking directly after the press conference Mr. Schreyer said the Optima can make Kia a “desirable brand” while maintaining core values such as affordability and economy.What they didn’t say: How will Kia stop the stylish new Optima from cannibalizing sales of sister company Hyundai? The Optima shares the same platform and engines as the Hyundai Sonata which received a similar revamp earlier this year. Toyota and Honda might be the intended targets but the Korean brands could equally end up stealing sales from each other.What makes it tick? Three engines are available: a naturally aspirated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder a 2-liter turbocharged 4 and in early 2011 a hybrid based on the 2.4-liter engine. A 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters are the transmission choices. The fanciest options – like a panoramic sunroof special black leather trim and the gorgeous 18-inch alloys seen on the show car at the New York Auto Show – come standard on the sportiest trim level the Optima SX.How much? How soon? The Optima in naturally-aspirated 2.4-liter and 2-liter turbocharged format arrives this fall. However the wait for the Optima hybrid stretches into early next year. Pricing (and official m.p.g. figures) will be revealed closer to the launch date.How does it look? This is one great looking car plain and simple. Other journalists at the New York auto show compared the exterior to cars from the likes of Saab and Audi.

 0,The Red Bulls (2-1-2 8 points) were back on the field only four days after their 2-0 victory against the expansion San Jose Earthquakes last Sunday. On Wednesday the Red Bulls traveled north to Canada for a match against Toronto F.C. (3-2-1 10 points) which had won three straight games after starting its second season in Major League Soccer with consecutive losses.The biggest news north of the border has been Toronto’s signing of the former MetroStars midfielder Amado Guevara. The Honduran international had two goals and an assist in the team’s first three victories. Before Thursday’s game against the Red Bulls at BMO Field Toronto had not allowed a goal in more than 200 minutes of play.Final Score: Red Bulls 1 Toronto F.C. 1The Ratings (on a scale of 1 diabolical; to 5 world class):GoalkeeperJon ConwayCaught a bit flat-footed on Toronto’s goal. Rushed off his line in the 76th minute to grab the ball and thwart a potential breakaway. Dealt well with cool and wet conditions. Grade: 3DefendersKevin GoldthwaiteTight across the back but rarely ventured into the attack — like is counterparts in the defense Thursday night. Solid if unspectacular. Grade: 3Jeff ParkeOn a rare foray into the offensive half Parke put an nice early ball onto the head of Ángel for a shot that was high. Solid in the middle of the defense. Dollar for dollar one of the best bargains in M.L.S. Grade: 3.5Hunter FreemanFirst start of the season after missing time because of an injury sustained as the United States under-23 team qualified for this summer’s Olympics in Beijing. A welcome replacement for a shaky Chris Leitch. Grade: 3MidfieldersDave van den BerghGot the Red Bulls even in the 39th minute on a low left-footed shot that ended Greg Sutton’s long shutout streak at 250 minutes. Van den Bergh struck from about 25 yards out and beat Sutton to the far post.. Grade: 4Claudio ReynaLargely uninspired 45 minutes before being replaced by Sinisa Ubiparipovic after sustaining an injury to his lower-left leg. Seemed to be competing with Mike Magee for a share of the ball when pushing forward. Grade: 2Seth StammlerEarly on Stammler reintroduced himself to Amado Guevara with a hard body check — no thought of going for the ball. Guevara was an absolute nonfactor in the second half. Stammler played the designated ball hawk most of the night. Strong savvy defender. Grade: 3.5Danleigh BormanThe rookie wing midfielder saw a lot of the ball in the first half and hit a couple of decent crossing balls. But struck an errant cross early in the second half after taking a nice pass from Ángel. Should have done better with it. Grade: 2.5Mike MageeHas shown some nice skillful flashes as a substitute early in the season. Made his first start of 2008. Always on the lookout to spring teammates with searching through balls. Good vision. Good skills. Somehow seems to wheedle his way into dangerous and opportunistic situations. If only the guy could stay healthy. Grade: 3.5Sinisa UbiparipovicCame on for second half replacing Reyna. Picked up a yellow card (so what else is new?) in the 69th on a foul from behind on Maurice Edu. Grade: 2Dane RichardsEntered the match in the 55th minute replacing Borman. First action of the season for the second-year player who sustained a knee injured during the club’s preseason training (in a so-called friendly) in Salzburg Austria. Grade: 2ForwardsJuan Pablo ÁngelThe high-scoring striker from Colombia has been hobbled by a back injury. Let his man slip away on Toronto’s goal by Marco Velez off a quick free kick. Missed a close-in header off a nice pass from Freeman in the 79th minute. Grade: 2.5Jozy AltidorePositioned more like an attacking midfielder out on the right flank early on. A different look for the team and for Altidore as he sent a couple of dangerous balls into the penalty area in the first 10 minutes. Had an opponent’s body on him nearly the entire first half. Switched to left side and moved forward for second half and had some dangerous runs. Pass with outside of right foot just failed to find Richards who was streaking to the net. Grade: 3.5John WolyniecLate late sub in stoppage time for Altidore. Grade: IncompleteSubstitutes/Did Not PlayZach Thornton (GK) Luke Sassano Chris Megaloudis Eric Brunner.

 9,''There's no question that Rubbia was the driving force behind the machine'' Dr. Knapp said in a telephone interview. ''But there were a thousand people who contributed to that project. In a way it's too bad when science gets to that point. But things are still moving ahead. Young people are still able to participate and make an impact.''Legends Recall the IndividualTeam research is not really a new phenomenon according to historians. They say the tradition dates to the ancient Greeks. But they also note that favorite tales passed down through the ages tend to ignore teamwork and emphasize lone genius.''Eureka!'' Archimedes reportedly cried as he ran naked through the streets of Syracuse to announce the discovery of his principle of buoyancy the idea having come to him in a flash when he first stepped into a bath.According to Dr. Owen Gingerich a historian at Harvard University while some ancient ''lone'' achievements were real others were often the result of quiet teamwork. This he said was undoubtedly the case with Claudius Ptolemy known through the ages as ''the greatest astronomer of antiquity.'' Ptolemy who lived in the 2d century in Alexandria Egypt wrote extensively on such subjects as astrology mathematics harmony geography and astronomy.''It's very unlikely that he did it single-handedly'' Dr. Gingerich said.''In many ancient cases there was cooperation'' he added. ''But there wasn't a model for equality. Instead if assistants were of sufficient stature they would became the giants of the next generation.''Even such luminaries as Sir Isaac Newton - who is said to have come to his most famous insight while sitting alone under an apple tree - were constantly in contact with peers and rivals using them as sounding boards to refine their ideas according to Dr. Kranzberg. ''The lone guy in a lab was always a romantic fiction'' he said. ''The Royal Society was founded in the 17th century. Newton was its president. They were always busy meeting and arguing their points.''Rise in Joint AuthorshipIn the 20th century the scientific quest has increasingly been based on teamwork according to sociologists of science. One sign they say is the rise in joint authorship. Scientific papers that used to have a single author now often have many on occasion more than 100. Dr. Robert K. Merton at Columbia University once performed a study of journals and found that in 1920 single authors accounted for 93 percent of the papers. By 1940 this had dropped to 65 percent and by 1960 it had fallen to 26 percent.

 9,A LEADING forecaster of advertising spending has raised his estimate for 1999 after cutting it earlier because of concerns about the worldwide economic turmoil last fall.With those qualms virtually vanquished and amid reports of robust first-quarter ad spending in myriad media Robert J. Coen senior vice president and forecasting director at the McCann-Erickson USA unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising is raising his predicted gain for 1999.In December the last time Mr. Coen offered predictions ''we saw signs the economy was questionable'' he said yesterday in a presentation at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan ''and we were cautious.''''But 1999 is turning out to be so much stronger than anybody expected'' he added. ''We have a lot more stimulus than anyone thought possible six months ago.''

 9,To the Editor:In raising understandable concerns about recent setbacks to enforcement of Voting Rights Act provisions to increase representation of minority voters "Voting Rights Under Siege" (editorial Feb. 16) presents a false choice: continued drawing of race-conscious legislative district lines that increase opportunities for minority voters to elect candidates of choice or a return to the days when the voting power of minorities was diluted in majority white districts.Both alternatives are anachronistic to those of us who believe we should simply strive to promote fair representation for all voters regardless of such subjectively defined criteria as one's race or where one lives. As the voters of Cambridge Mass. Peoria Ill. and several other American communities have discovered there are ways to achieve this goal: modified at-large voting systems such as preference voting and cumulative voting.Modified at-large systems are structured to allow more voters to elect candidates of choice without exercising any more voting power than other voters. Unlike race-conscious districts they provide fair representation by allowing individual voters to define the representation they seek. Preference voting and cumulative voting are fully consistent with the principles of one person one vote; they only break from American winner-take-all traditions by ending the unnecessary link of one vote per election contest.By providing "universal coverage" for fair representation these colorblind partisan-blind voting systems are the best way for the United States to achieve consensus on insuring better representation of minorities -- and of majorities. Winner-take-all elections in single-member districts will never allow us to reach this consensus because they systematically and unavoidably deprive large numbers of voters of any realistic chance of helping to elect candidates of choice.

 9,Russia in 1812 One of the things about Napoleon in Russia that Leo Tolstoy could not rationally explain was why the famous and disastrous retreat from Russia ever took place. It is Tolstoy's opinion set down in "War and Peace" that after the burning of Moscow the French Emperor should have headed not for home but southwestward into the rich and warm Ukraine.

 9,SOMETIMES the question is not so much what's in a name as it is what's in a place?The thought was prompted by the local furor in Suffolk County about the name of Shirley the village on Sunrise Highway Extension near the south end of South Haven Park (Yaphank is at the north end). There are those who would like to change the name of Shirley to Floyd Harbor and there are those who have vowed that they will never renounce Shirley.There is no evidence of sexism in the debate between Shirley and Floyd none of the kind of thing that resulted in the weather people's finally deciding to use male as well as female names when it comes to hurricanes. A community is not a hurricane although a name change may sometimes indicate which way the wind is blowing.When Constantinople which is not on Long Island but in Turkey became Istanbul one knew that there had been a change in management from Greek to Turk. In Northern Ireland the Irish Catholics call the border city Derry while those with strong Empire leanings keep it on the map as Londonderry. Jerusalem the Hebrew and best-known name of the Israeli city which was in Roman times Aeolia Capitolina is known to the Arabs as Al-Kuds the Holy Place.Suffolk's neighbor to the west the town of Nieuw Amsterdam suddenly became New York in 1664 when the British conquerors retired the Dutch founders. The venerable Long Island Historical Society recently changed its name to the Brooklyn Historical Society in keeping with its Brooklyn Heights location. In early years Brooklyn its own city was widely acknowledged to be on Long Island and indeed was the place where Washington's 1776 battle with the British took place.

 0,AT the peak of the New York Cares Coat Drive its distribution center -- donated warehouse space at the Chelsea Market in Manhattan -- was a mountain range of shapes and colors. Thousands of used coats that had been contributed to the drive were sorted into categories: men's women's and children's; large medium and small.Colleen Farrell stopped sorting one morning to admire an extra-large lined leather coat with a fur-trimmed hood. It ended up in one of the bags that Nathaniel Thompson 56 took to St. Bartholomew's Church in Midtown.Those who came to the church's soup kitchen were told that anyone needing a coat could go outside to Mr. Thompson's van. Theotis Allen 46 and homeless wanted something to replace a much-too-thin coat.Mr. Thompson pulled out the leather coat. Mr. Allen put it on and headed off to find a place for the night. Maybe he would try Penn Station though he had been kicked out before. He crossed Fifth Avenue talking about how much he enjoyed Rockefeller Center this time of year. It felt like snow was coming but at least he was warmer. NICOLE BENGIVENO

 0,Many Ferris wheel fans stay on the Wonder Wheel at the Coney Island boardwalk for more than one stomach-flipping ride but none take as many spins as Kato who most days rides the wheel from the moment it opens at noon until it closes at midnight. Then it's time for Kato to get to work.Not that he has a long commute. Kato is a dog a mix of German shepherd and Akita and when he's not riding the 150-foot-high Wonder Wheel which towers over the Cyclone roller coaster he's guarding it.''He's on the night shift'' said Dennis D. Vourderis who with his brother Steve owns the Ferris wheel and 21 smaller rides and attractions surrounding it. From midnight to noon Kato walks around the fenced-in Wonder Wheel compound. But when he's off-duty and it is not raining or too cold Kato prefers riding the Wheel to heading home to the dog run he shares with the park's three other guard dogs.Many people first spot Kato as he spins past in his specially modified cagelike car while they are waiting in line. ''They think it's quite comical'' Dennis Vourderis said. ''They try to get his attention and then they see his head pop up. Sometimes he just barks at people in line.''
 0,The economic summit that begins today in the French Alps -- the first meeting since the war in Iraq between Mr. Bush and European leaders who opposed it -- is the start of a new effort to revive globalization. It is the annual meeting of the Group of 8 which includes Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan Russia and the United States.Beyond the disagreements over Iraq the United States and Europe have had a number of clashes over trade. Europe for example opposed genetically modified foods and criticized steel tariffs and tax benefits for exporters like Boeing in the United States. The recent decline in the dollar has also made life difficult for European companies that had become accustomed to the effective price edge on their goods while the dollar was higher.After the Évian meeting the next step in the trade talks known as the Doha round will be in Cancún Mexico in September. In Cancún differences over agricultural subsidies and drug patents will be more clearly on display than they are this week as negotiators who have fallen behind schedule determine whether they can meet their own deadline of signing a new pact by 2005.In the meantime officials from the United States and Latin America will continue their fitful discussions about creating a trade zone for the Western Hemisphere similar to one that exists in North America.''All the trade negotiations are in trouble'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. the president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a former trade negotiator. The steps taken during the last decade ''have been so successful that we've gotten down to the final difficult issues.''Bush administration officials take a more positive view saying they remain committed free traders despite their support last year for new steel tariffs and farm subsidies. Officials cite successes in the war on terrorism which they say are removing a major obstacle to the movement of people and goods and recent trade pacts with Chile and Singapore. Those pacts are part of a strategy that Robert B. Zoellick the United States trade representative calls competitive liberalization in which the administration seeks to maintain free-trade momentum even if global talks bog down.John B. Taylor the under secretary of the Treasury in charge of international affairs said: ''You take steps forward and move back. That's always the case.'' Over all he added ''the trends are good.''

 0,LAZAROF--Henri. Prolific composer and educator Henri Lazarof passed away from Alzheimer's disease at his home in Los Angeles California. Mr. Lazarof was born in Sofia Bulgaria on April 12 1932 where he spent his youth studying at the Jesuit Lycee Francais. As a student he showed an early talent in music and became a concert pianist before his teenage years. In his early teens he turned to music composition. His family immigrated to Tel Aviv Israel where he studied with Paul Ben-Haim a prominent Israeli composer. During Mr. Lazarof's army service he organized concerts throughout Israel for the Israeli troops. He won the first musical scholarship awarded in Israel to attend the prestigious Saint Cecilia Academy in Rome where he studied with the renowned composer Goffredo Petrassi. Mr. Lazarof arrived in Rome speaking four languages fluently but not one word of Italian. In three months he mastered the Italian language and became a tour guide. He finished his four-year courses in three years and won another scholarship to Brandeis University in Massachusetts. There he studied under the guidance of American composers Arthur Berger and Harold Shapero and became fluent in English his eighth language. In 1966 Mr. Lazarof moved to California and became a Professor Emeritus at the University of California Los Angeles teaching music composition and organizing contemporary music festivals. From 1970 to 1971 he served as composer-in-residence in Berlin; in 1979 he held the same position at the highly acclaimed Tanglewood Music Center in Boston Massachusetts. In 1982 Mr. Lazarof decided to solely focus his attention on musical composition. Throughout the course of his career Mr. Lazarof had 126 works published with the Associated Music Publishers Theodore Presser Bot and Bock and others. These works include seven symphonies three concertos for orchestra three violin concertos three cello concertos two flute concertos a viola concerto a piano concerto 11 string quartets and innumerable pieces for orchestra chamber orchestra small ensembles solo instruments and mixed chorus. Numerous works were commissioned and recorded and premiered by various orchestras throughout Europe Asia and the United States including Carnegie Hall in New York; "First Symphony" with the Utah Symphony Orchestra; "Concerto No. 2 Icarus" with the Houston Symphony Orchestra; "Concerto for Oboe and Chamber Orchestra" with the New York Chamber Symphony; "Symphony No. 5 for Solo Baritone Mixed Chorus and Orchestra" with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's passion for art was reflected in his music such as the "String Quartet No. 8" homage to Paul Klee and "Tableaux (after Kandinsky)" premiered by Garrick Ohlson and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. His prizes included first place in the International Tchaikovsky Competition; First International Competition from Monaco for Concerto for Viola and Orchestra; and First International Prize City of Milan La Scala Award for his musical composition "Structures Sonores." He also received grants from the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts as well as two Grammy nominations in 1991 for Best Contemporary Composition and Best Classical Performance Instrumental Soloist(s) with Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's compositions were known for their broad range of textures dynamics and diversity of rhythms. Many of his works used unusual seldom written combinations of instruments. By refusing to settle within any one ideology or style even those of his own previous works Mr. Lazarof remained faithful to his principal of growth and exploration producing a body of work that will endure. Survivors include his wife sister son daughter-in-law four stepdaughters and their spouses and nine grandchildren. Services will be on Friday January 3 2014 at Hillside Mortuary in Los Angeles California at 2:00pm. In lieu of flowers the family would appreciate contributions to the Henri Lazarof Memorial Fund c/o American Youth Symphony 3424 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 830 Los Angeles California 90010 (310) 470-2332.
 9,Atter its sharp decline on Thursday the world sugar futures market regained a little equlibrium yesterday. Trading slowed from a near record 6344 contracts to 1400 contracts.The sharp drop on Thursday followed reliable reports of better than expected supply situation. Yesterday at the opening of trading there was some further liquidation of sugar contracts by speculators probably due to some margin calls after Thursday's debacle.As one broker commented the selling may have been overdone because trade buying entered to steady the market and push prices ahead for the day.The busy September delivery which declined from 3.83 cents a pound to 3.70 cents on Thursday pushed ahead to close at a range of 3.74 cents to 3.75 cents yesterday. The world spot price remained unchanged yesterday at 3.75 cents.
 9,ROME June 2—Pope Paul VI today elevated his principal aide to cardinal thus placing him among the candidates for the papacy.The Pope appointed Archbishop Giovanni Benelli known as the second most powerful official in the Vatican the Archbishop of Florence. This post and his elevation to cardinal clearly put Monsignor Benelli among those mentioned as possible successors to the present Pontiff who will be 80 years old in September.Monsignor Benelli who is 56 years old has served for 10 years as deputy secretary of state. This powerful post allowed him to screen appointments and papers for the Pope. This is the same job once held by Pope Paul under Pius XII.Pope Paul was also moved from the job as deputy secretary of state to the post of Archbishop of Milan by Pope Pius. Such experience outside the Vatican is regarded as important for all papal candidates.
 0,On the simplest level the show works as a raucous parody that sends up the hokey conventions of the sitcom genre. This fictional George (played by the unexpectedly funny Timothy Bottoms) is a bumbling father like Homer Simpson or Hal on ''Malcolm in the Middle.'' Homer works at a nuclear power plant and George holds the power to start a nuclear strike but both would have trouble feeding themselves without help from their smarter wives. George is the president as doofus Dad. And who after all is more of a national Daddy figure than a president?But after the informal scandal-ridden Clinton years what could seem more retro and hollow than putting the first family on a pedestal? ''That's My Bush!'' is a satire of hero worship itself; it is the anti-''West Wing'' and the first true post-Clinton comedy.Its creators have gone out of their way to say the show is not political but they're the ''South Park'' guys; we're not supposed to take what they say literally. It is true however that the series is not ideological. The concept in place long before the election was to spoof the first family whether that meant going after Bushes or Gores. The show's production and its original debut date of Feb. 28 were delayed because of the post-election tussle.But the series is not divorced from politics. George tackles issues like abortion and gun control treating them as superficially as the typical sitcom or 60-second campaign ad does. What the series make you wonder is the big difference between these approaches?This politically astute criticism is embedded in so much hysterical humor that the series never seems weighty. References to classic sitcoms are everywhere beginning with the mock opening credits that introduce the characters some more linked to reality than others. Besides George and Laura there is the fictional Maggie a smart-mouthed maid who looks like the heroine of the 60's comedy ''Hazel'' and is played by Marcia Wallace from ''The Bob Newhart Show.'' There is a next-door neighbor who keeps barging into the house for no reason; he is named Larry (John D'Aquino) like the neighbor in the second ''Newhart'' series. (''Hi I'm Larry this is my brother Darryl this is my other brother Darryl.'') And there is Karl Rove (Kurt Fuller) a balding right-hand man who keeps the Oval Office from chaos and of course has the same name as the real president's adviser and campaign mastermind.

 9,"It's not so different from paying ransom to buy back your baby" said Constance Lowenthal executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research an organization that specializes in tracking stolen art.She was speaking of the out-of-court settlement made final last Tuesday in which the Government of Germany acting in the name of a small Lutheran church in the medieval town of Quedlinburg paid $2.75 million to a family in Texas for returning and relinquishing all claims to the glittering thousand-year-old treasures stolen by an American soldier in the closing days of World War II. Ms. Lowenthal spoke for many who were shocked by the settlement since the heirs of Lieut. Joe Tom Meador who died in 1980 had admitted in court that he "inappropriately removed" the treasures.There are practical reasons for paying ransom for stolen art rather than pursuing a case in court. In the art world the question of who owns what can be anything but clear-cut especially when works from ancient civilizations are involved and there is little desire to set precedents that might later be used to question who owns antiquities now in major museums.But will the Quedlinburg settlement establish a precedent for the payment of multi-million dollar shakedowns ("a finder's fee" the Germans called it) for the return of other World War II war spoils? Or will a more generous spirit take hold?

 0,It's always hard to tell just what ends and what begins on Labor Day. Schoolkids have the best answer because for them a change of life is coming right around the bend. A surprising number of adults with or without school-age children of their own also feel the echoes of the educational calendar as if the first few days of September still meant new teachers new classrooms and the strange sense of starting over and picking up right where you left off.In summer we search for a kind of stasis -- an uninterrupted expanse of time even if it only lasts for part of an afternoon now and then. But with Labor Day another instinct kicks in a love of transition. It's one of those moments when we look up from whatever we've been doing and notice often in unfeigned horror how many days deep into the year we really are. There was never any possibility of going backward in time but somehow the year didn't seem quite so irrevocable on Memorial Day as it does on the 1st of September.Labor Day is a traditional marker in an increasingly nontraditional flow of time. All the old calendars -- from school church and farm -- reinforce the strong seasonality of human experience. But all the new calendars -- of business information entertainment and politics -- insist on the unbroken continuousness of time the never-ending utility or diversion in every passing moment. Most of us can feel the tension between the old and the new calendars even if we only notice it from time to time. The paradox of Labor Day which we try to honor by ceasing our labors nicely catches the way those calendars collide in our lives.It may well feel like summer for the next few weeks but it's a different kind of summer. The light comes later in the morning and goes sooner in the evening and the sun cuts a lower track across the sky. It's easy to pretend that such incremental differences don't have much effect on us anymore now that we live in a world that never stops ticking buzzing beeping humming and glowing. But they do. The cities that engulf us may look artificial but they're inhabited by beings who feel the ancestral pulse of time and change. Labor Day comes and goes in a flash but it's long enough for us to sense the calendar tipping toward fall toward whatever fall will bring.

 9,Mr. Warren-Boulton acknowledged the narrow point but noted that most of the contracts called for the Internet access companies to guarantee that 75 percent or more of their customers use Microsoft's browser.Mr. Lacovara countered by asking whether such exclusive cross-promotional deals were standard in many industries. ''Absent monopoly power'' Mr. Warren-Boulton replied in a pointed return to his theme that the antitrust rules are different for monopolies ''exclusive-dealing arrangements can be assumed to be benign.''In the morning session Mr. Lacovara offered evidence that several large computer manufacturers including Hewlett-Packard now ship their personal computers with their own hybrid Web browser installed. Was that not an indication Mr. Lacovara asked that Microsoft was not restricting manufacturers nearly as much as Mr. Warren-Boulton and the Government have contended?Not really Mr. Warren-Boulton responded. The Hewlett-Packard browser like others is really just a ''shell'' -- a custom-made user interface behind which lies the code for Microsoft's browser Internet Explorer he said.''This works for Microsoft'' Mr. Warren-Boulton said ''because it increases the installed base for Internet Explorer'' and prompts developers to write complementary software.After a couple of years of enforcing contracts that limited the freedom of computer makers to offer the Internet software from rivals Microsoft loosened the contracts earlier this year mostly with the introduction of Windows 98 an upgrade of its operating system introduced in June.Similarly Microsoft relaxed some contract restrictions on Internet service suppliers early this year. By then Mr. Warren-Boulton said ''the game was over'' in terms of tipping key channels of software distribution in Microsoft's favor. The easing of contract restrictions also came after the Justice Department's high-profile investigation of Microsoft was well under way and the company faced Senate hearings and a Government challenge in a separate case.

 9,But very quickly the Paines outgrew 50. Four years ago Josh was born; two years later Daniel came along.Mr. Paine often worked the night shift at Eastman Kodak and he found that trying to sleep during the day in the small house was an art. In winter with everyone cooped up the hallway outside Mr. Paine's door sounded like the New Jersey Turnpike. ''The house had a real bad traffic pattern'' said Mrs. Paine. ''The kids were up and down the hall constantly.''Last May Mrs. Paine put a note in Mrs. Hoffman's mailbox suggesting a possible switch. Because no real-estate fees were involved they could sell below the market price. The Hoffmans sold the bigger house for $67000 though it was appraised at $80000; the Paines sold the smaller house for $53000 though the appraisal was $65000.The larger house at 48 is just what the Paines needed. ''We can't get over having three bathrooms'' Mrs. Paine said. For a while Josh the 4-year-old could find only two of them.Mr. and Mrs. Paine have done a lot already including pulling up carpeting in the family room putting in new storm doors and painting the boys' rooms. They plan much more. Their new home is so much bigger; they don't even have furniture for the dining room yet.''But for the Hoffmans it was not quite as exciting as for us'' said Mrs. Paine 26. ''To settle for a smaller house it's discouraging.''Mrs. Hoffman 41 could not afford 48 any more. In December 1983 she was divorced. The judge gave her 18 months either to buy out her ex-husband or sell the big house and split the profit.

 9,The Westinghouse Electric Corporation is all but ready to announce its $5 billion bid to buy CBS Inc. Most of the details of the $81-a-share cash deal were sewn up yesterday and the CBS board is scheduled to meet this morning to approve the offer people with knowledge about the negotiations said.If CBS directors give their blessing as expected the acquisition will be announced this afternoon in New York. A Westinghouse spokesman declined to comment.In lining up the necessary financing from Chemical Bank and J. P. Morgan  the lead banks Westinghouse has apparently agreed to sell between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in assets within two years. Proceeds from the sales would be applied immediately against the loan's principal a person familiar with the terms said.Some of those close to the transaction said that yesterday's $19 billion merger between the Walt Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC was having no effect on the Westinghouse-CBS marriage.

 0,The brother of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran was sentenced to five years in prison on corruption charges the state news media reported on Tuesday and four people were sentenced in another case on charges of spying for the United States and Britain with one person facing the death penalty.The penalties added to the perception that Mr. Rouhani is under increasing pressure in Iran where he won elections in 2013 and 2017 partly on promises to curb corruption and end the country’s prolonged economic isolation.Instead corruption has flourished the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement promoted by Mr. Rouhani is near collapse and Iran’s economy has been seriously hurt by President Trump’s restoration of sanctions.Mr. Rouhani’s brother Hossein Fereydoun was arrested in 2017 in connection with long-running accusations of corruption and the Iranian judiciary said at the time that he was the subject of “multiple investigations.”
 0,Since the Nixon administration the federal government has stopped building subsidized housing. Once public housing was a proud symbol of postwar American democracy. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers got good homes and a leg up. Now Washington offers tax incentives some $7 billion a year to private developers so they will take over the job. The public has gone from builder to beggar.For comparison’s sake Washington each year gives up more than $100 billion nationally in mortgage interest deductions which principally benefit the upper-middle class.This year’s presidential candidates — even Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton — have so far said next to nothing about affordable housing. Amazingly neither of those Democrats had evidently visited a public-housing project before the New York primary in April. The Democrats have since strengthened the party’s platform; but the issue didn’t seriously come up at either convention so it is hard to believe much help is forthcoming.City Hall knows this and plans to steer billions of capital dollars toward housing allocating more money to subsidize affordable homes than the next 50 United States cities combined. Even so absent greater federal money it will remain nearly impossible to reach the levels of affordability that low-income New Yorkers actually need.Of course housing isn’t the only issue that matters to city residents. Zoning should grow out of holistic planning based on participatory governance. Communities have been complaining loudly that the de Blasio administration is a stalking horse for large developers hellbent on securing as much housing development as it can wrangle out of rezoning negotiations with neighborhoods conceding only what’s necessary — not collaborating with locals from the start.In East New York the first neighborhood the mayor rezoned the city has paved the way for subsidized apartments and neighborhood improvements. But speculators have also bought property driven up land prices and threatened some of the very residents the rezoning is intended to protect fueling fears among poor New Yorkers that Mr. de Blasio’s plan will make neighborhoods even less affordable. In some cases the relatively high price of affordable apartments may actually drive up housing costs.

 9,The Soviet press has not given general currency to the persistent speculation abroad that the assassination of President Kennedy was the result of a plot.It has never publicly acknowledged that Oswald spent some time in the Soviet Union.After the immediate flush of excitement that followed the murder of the President there has been no concerted effort of the part of newspapers here to represent the assassination as the result of a dark conspiracy instigated by rightwingers because of Mr. Kennedy's efforts to improve the international climate between East and West.Communist party propagandists are apparently reconciled to the prevalent view that Oswald carried out the assassination without any accomplice and that the killing of Oswald was the work of one man Ruby and not as Soviet papers hinted at first staged with the connivance of the Dallas police.This general press policy however has not prevented the occasional reprinting of Western speculation in Soviet newspapers.

 9,When a piece of Giuseppe Soffiantini's right ear arrived by mail at the office of a top Italian newscaster last week the debate over Italy's kidnapping laws took on new urgency.It was not the first time that the kidnappers of the 62-year-old businessman had sent such gruesome evidence to prove that their victim was still alive. Last November five months after he was seized at his house outside the northern Italian city of Brescia his family received a piece of his left ear -- strengthening their conviction that if they wanted to see him alive they would have to pay ransom.But under Italian law families are barred from paying ransom or negotiating with kidnappers except with the permission of a prosecutor and the cooperation of the police. In fact the 1991 law unique to Italy goes one step further and imposes an automatic and obligatory freeze on assets belonging to the kidnapped victim's family.The idea was to discourage Italy's kidnapping gangs whose exploits included the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty 3d and the kidnapping in 1992 of an 8-year-old Egyptian boy Farouk Kassam. In both cases parts of their ears were sliced off.

 0,Updated 6:44 p.m. | STAMFORD Conn. — After traveling to New York City to rouse phone-bank volunteers making calls for Senator John McCain Senator Joseph I. Lieberman returned to his home state of Connecticut for yet another event to promote Mr. McCain’s White House candidacy. Mr. McCain is scheduled to hold a campaign rally at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield Conn. at 1 p.m. on Sunday.Mr. Lieberman lost the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont in 2006 but went on to win re-election to a fourth term as an independent. Since then he has caucused with the Democrats but often voted with Republicans. His support for Senator John McCain’s run for the presidency is no different.At the Stamford Government Center this afternoon Mr. Lieberman joined Representative Christopher Shays Republican of Connecticut to discuss Mr. McCain’s visit to Connecticut. They plan to join Mr. McCain during his visit to Fairfield.Mr. Shays said that Mr. McCain did not need to visit to win the Republican primary in Connecticut. “He’ll probably win this state without coming but he wants to say thank you to Joe” Mr. Shays said.Democrats across the state have expressed outrage at Mr. Lieberman’s endorsement of a Republican candidate. But Mr. Lieberman said it would be “irresponsible” of him to not support the candidate he thought was best for the job “just because of party lines.”“I know it’s unusual for a Democrat to support a Republican but it’s not unusual for normal people to do that” he said. “People vote for the best person for office.”“Good point” said Mr. Shays nodding in agreement.Mr. Lieberman in keeping with his positions on foreign policy and the war in Iraq and against Islamic terrorism said the main reason why he supports Mr. McCain is because he is an “instant world leader.”“He’s ready to be the commander in chief at a time when we’re at a war with Islamic terrorists” he said. “He’s ready to lead us to victory in the war”Mr. Lieberman stressed Mr. McCain’s independent political tendencies as a reason he was supporting him. He mentioned that Mr. McCain was for stem cell research and was also one of the first Republicans to address global warming seriously.“I think McCain is a Connecticut kind of political leader” said Mr. Lieberman. “We never hesitate to work across party lines.”“He’s the kind of person who will shake things up.”Mr. McCain will be good for Connecticut because he’s a straight talker a listener and a man willing to acknowledge when mistakes are made added Mr. Shays.“He’s not an ideologue” he said.Mr. Lieberman was sure to point out that he respected both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama but that Mr. McCain had more experience.When asked if he would consider running with Mr. McCain should he earn the nomination Mr. Lieberman said absolutely not as he told The Associated Press in an interview this week. “I’ve been there and done that” he told reporters in Stamford.Nancy DiNardo chairwoman of the Connecticut Democratic Party issued a highly critical statement in response to Mr. Lieberman’s appearance in Connecticut with Mr. McCain:I continue to be disappointed beyond words with Joe Lieberman as are a lot of Connecticut Democrats — saddened surprised and truly disheartened by just how completely he has abandoned the Democratic principles that have guided him over the years and the Party whose members have supported him and helped him achieve his goals. As recently as 18 months ago Senator Lieberman was telling us Democrats that he shares our values and with the exemption of Iraq that he agrees with us on the issues we care so much about — critically important issues like a woman’s right to choose tax and economic policies health care and education. Moreover in July of 2006 Senator Lieberman even stated that he intended to work to help a Democrat get into the White House in 2008. His endorsement of Senator McCain means he either doesn’t care about the issues noted above or he’s putting politics ahead of people. If you look at Senator McCain’s voting record and campaign platform – on these and many other issues we care about – you’ll understand why I am saying this. This is a man Senator McCain who proudly says he was a “foot soldier” in the Reagan Revolution. Senator McCain is wrong on the issues we Democrats care so much about—and he’s wrong by a lot. I am proud to stand with my fellow Democrats and announce that we as a Party will grow stronger and do everything in our power to make sure a Democrat is elected in November.Christine Stuart contributed reporting from Hartford.

 0,Citing a telecom newsletter and a Paris-based analyst Reuters reported Tuesday that Alcatel is in talks with Nortel Networks its Canadian rival to acquire its high-speed mobile arm. Such a deal would be worth 1.51 billion euro ($1.91 billion) Reuters said.The French telecom giant has only a few months to seal a deal before it seals its merger with U.S. rival Lucent at the end of this year. Any deal with Nortel would face far higher hurdles after the Lucent tie-up is complete.“We are open to all options that would allow us to boost our presence in that technology” Alcatel told Reuters without confirming the talks. A Nortel spokesman said the company declined comment.The talks have arisen only two weeks after Nortel unveiled a four-year partnership with Microsoft focusing on Internet calling and video and instant messaging. Before that Nortel was seen as the odd man out in an industry that had been brimming with tie-ups including those between Ericsson and Marconi and Nokia and Siemens.Previous items on DealBook noted speculation on possible partners for Nortel including Motorola Cisco China’s Huawei and yes Alcatel.Oddo a French brokerage said an Alcatel-Nortel deal would make sense as a combined Alcatel-Lucent would have only 6 percent of the market for high-speed cellular equipment. And Sam Greenholtz an analyst with Telecom Pragmatics told TheStreet.com: “Nortel has been looking to focus more to the IP market. And Alcatel could really use the wireless technology. It would give them a chance to win back customers that they had lost.”Go to Article from Reuters »Go to Article from TheStreet.com »

 9,To the Editor:"Sister Souljah Is No Willie Horton" (editorial June 17) indicates that Sister Souljah was calling for violence against whites and praises Gov. Bill Clinton for condemning her statement in a speech to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.In the same issue "Rapper Chided by Clinton Calls Him a Hypocrite" (news article) indicates that Sister Souljah's statement was in response to a "question about the views of those who committed the violence":"Did they think it was wise? Was that wise reasoned action?"While Sister Souljah's answer may not have been artful it is clear that she was attempting to convey the thinking of those who committed the violence in Los Angeles who thought nothing of killing blacks or whites.I am fearful that you did what so many white Americans including Mr. Clinton do when it comes to remarks made by blacks in not examining the context of the statement and jumping to the conclusion that this is another black calling for violence against whites.Your editorial also indicates that many black elected officials rallied to Mr. Clinton's support. However note that Representative Charles Rangel of New York interpreted Mr. Clinton's action "as a way to court white voters." I am sure that the average black voter will agree.
 9,The National Basketball Association fined Bill Laimbeer of the Detroit Pistons and Brad Daugherty of the Cleveland Cavaliers $5000 each yesterday for fighting during a game last Friday. The players had received one-game suspensions without pay -costing Daugherty $10000 and Laimbeer $7300 - and both missed games on Sunday. Wayne Embry the Cavaliers' general manager was fined $1000 for leaving his seat behind the Cleveland bench and charging onto the court during the fight. Daugherty is appealing his fine. ''I was wrong to take a swing at him but to put me in the same boat as Laimbeer is ludicrous'' he said.(AP)
 0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students research write edit illustrate and compile a traveler’s guide to their town or community for children or teenagers their own age.Author(s):Katherine Schulten The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes-1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Consider why people enjoy traveling and describe one place they would like to visit and why.2. Examine a subjective itinerary of New York City sites by reading and discussing “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame.”3. Plan as a class how to write and compile a Travel Guide to their town written for kids their own age.4. Write rough drafts of personal reviews for individual entries in this Travel Guide.5. Rewrite edit illustrate and compile these individual reviews into one Guide in future classes.Resources / Materials:-student journals-classroom blackboard-paper-copies of “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “What for you makes a place desirable to visit? What place would you most like to visit? Why?” Students then share their answers.2. As a class read and discuss “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame” focusing on the following questions:a. What is the overall tone of this piece? How would you compare such a subjective personal guide to New York with say an encyclopedia description of the City?b. What one site or attraction described in this piece would you most like to visit? Why?c. What is the difference between an adventure and a “misadventure”? What misadventures have you been on?d. What “street smart” advice does Edward the City Cousin give? What “street smart” advice could you give a visitor to your town?e. What does it mean to “get in touch with your inner Auntie Mame”? How does that attitude seem to define this whole article?3. Tell students they will be creating a Visitor’s Guide to their own town written specifically for kids their age. Each student will choose a site event and/or activity to write about; later the class will edit and illustrate this work to compile into one pamphlet or book. As a class decide how this work should best be done. (Should students form small groups each taking charge of one category of activity such as “eating” “shopping” “the arts” or “sports”? Should the class compile a list of “must-include” items together then assign individuals to write each? Or should individual students simply submit one review each of a place event or attraction they highly recommend?) The teacher may choose one of these methods or ask the class to decide how it would best be done. Teacher and/or students may also broaden or narrow the overall topic depending on the size of the community. (For example in a large city students may choose to simply write a list of the best places in one neighborhood; in a small town students might include attractions and seasonal events from a whole region). After the class compiles a list have students select one topic each making sure that no students have the same topic.4. Students begin to individually plan and craft their own reviews using those in “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame” as a model.5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students visit or research in some other way the sites or attractions they have been assigned and continue to polish their entries. In future classes students can meet as a whole class or in small group teams to decide how to illustrate edit and compile these individual entries to create one book or pamphlet. Classes might then think of where and how to distribute the results – and consider anywhere from the school newspaper to the town Visitor’s Center to a website.Further Questions for Discussion:a. What is the best adventure you ever had while traveling or hosting a visitor? The worst misadventure?b. Where did you most like to visit in your area when you were younger? When and why do you think you outgrew it?c. Does travel “broaden the mind”? Why or why not?d. Do you think you would want to attend a college far from home or nearby? Why?e. Where do kids your age seem to “hang out” most in your area? Why do you think that is?f. What makes a place appealing to people your age? How could your town be made more appealing for you and your peers?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries participation in class and small group discussions and planning sessions and creation of individual entries for the class Traveler’s Guide.Vocabulary:symmetry chaperon honing mortification nonchalance relishes dispenser overfranchised evoke itineraries jaded cicerones venerable myriad doting warren memorabilia eminently gawk intermittently campy boisterousExtension Activities:1. Read the novel “Auntie Mame” or watch the movie and imagine an “Auntie Mame” figure in your own life who would brighten the humdrum. Then write an essay or short story that describes how your life might change as a result.2. Create a “traveler’s guide” or map to the world of a character in a book you have read. Be sure to see this world from the character’s point of view rather than your own. How would his or her “take” on this place differ from a reader’s?3. Write the speech you would deliver if you were chosen as a tour guide to your school. What sites would you make sure to point out to visitors? What would you say about them? What other information would you include?4. Write an essay about either a great adventure or a great misadventure you have had while traveling.5. Create a pitch to deliver to your principal arguing for a one-day educational class trip to a site or event about which you think your teachers may not have recognized the educational value. What would your class learn? What assignments might be given? How would this visit relate in some way to curricula you are studying?Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Plan an educational tour that students in your school could go on next summer that will feature at least 5 important historical sites central to some theme in American history. Your theme can be as specific and “offbeat” as you like (“scandals in American history” “technological innovations”) but should be something the school would deem educational. Write a rationale for the overall theme and for each site included.Geography- What ten places in the world do you most want to visit? Note each on a map of the world along with the important topographical information about each place and reasons why you listed them.Global History-If you could visit any time or place in history what would it be? Write an essay describing the time and place you would choose and why. What specific events and/or people would you want to see? What questions might you ask your “hosts” on this visit?-Museums are a big tourist attraction all over the world. How did museums come to be? When and where was the first created? What are the strangest museums you can find? Which would you most like to visit and why?Technology- Visit a number of websites that concern travel to specific places in order to get ideas for a website of your own. Then design a website that displays the information compiled in your class Traveler’s Guide (or a guide of your own) in some way that will make people want to visit.background: Teachers may want to explain the “Auntie Mame” reference in the title and text of the article. (It is the title of a novel by Patrick Dennis – made into both a famous movie and a famous play – in which an orphan boy goes on wild escapades with his eccentric loveable aunt).Other Information on the Web:Explore online city guides to learn more about the places people and events of your city or cities that you plan to visit.

 9,Opposition politicians grumbled about a deal in a smoke-filled room. One leading newspaper speculated that it had been sealed over glasses of port at Brooks a luxurious Establishment club.Not so said Sir Nicholas Goodison chairman of the London Stock Exchange as he answered questions Friday about reforms the exchange plans to accept in return for an end to a long and expensive legal battle with the Government's Office of Fair Trading which has accused it of about 150 restrictive practices. To start with Sir Nicholas noted wryly he does not smoke or drink port and he is not a member of Brooks.The deal worked out between Sir Nicholas and Cecil Parkinson the new Trade Secretary surprised the financial community and those who follow it because it contained so few concessions by the exchange.Three Key ElementsThe agreement has three key elements. The most important is the promise to phase out the exchange's minimum commissions on securities transactions by the end of 1986 a transition the New York Stock Exchange made in 1975 in just 18 months. The two others allow nonmembers to play a larger role in the affairs of member companies and the exchange itself including the council that runs it.

 0,AP Photo/Stephen CherninThe Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Offenbach’s “Contes d’Hoffmann” stirred up heated debate within opera circles for the company’s decision to present a version of the score that fails to take into account recent research into the sources for this compromised score left incomplete at Offenbach’s death. The new production of Bizet’s “Carmen” may also provoke some debate over questions of authenticity.Bizet wrote “Carmen” as an opéra-comique which meant that extended stretches of dialogue were spoken not sung. The term opéra-comique gives the false impression that such operas are comic. But even serious works within this tradition used spoken dialogue as a way of conveying everyday realism.“Carmen” had its premiere in Paris in March 1875 just months before Bizet died at 36. Later that year for a production of “Carmen” in Vienna the composer Ernest Guiraud adapted the spoken dialogue from the libretto (by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy) into recitative which he wrote. It was in this version that “Carmen” gained its immense popularity for the next century.Starting in the 1960s or so it became increasingly common for “Carmen” to be performed as Bizet intended: with spoken dialogue. The Met chose that option for its celebrated 1972 production starring Marilyn Horne and conducted by Leonard Bernstein documented in a Deutsche Grammophon recording.For its new production by the director Richard Eyre the Met is using Guiraud-composed recitatives which was also the choice of Franco Zeffirelli who created the previous production in 1996 a lamentable show. Purists will no doubt object to the Met’s recalcitrance on this matter.Pragmatic reasons are typically cited when a company chooses to use Guiraud’s recitatives. Singers who are not native French speakers are often reluctant to speak the language on stage. Also mezzo-sopranos who revere classic old recordings like the historic 1951 RCA recording starring Risë Stevens with Fritz Reiner conducting often long to sing the role the way they heard it growing up.The Met’s new “Carmen” is a gripping and brilliant production. Still I would have been willing to hear certain singers speak imperfect French for the chance to experience the opera with the realistic urgency that comes from having the dialogue spoken. In this case Elina Garanca the Met’s Latvian Carmen would have been trading many spoken lines with Roberto Alagna the French tenor of Sicilian heritage which would had added pressure on the star.Today at least a majority of opera companies around the world present “Carmen” without the Guiraud recitatives. Let the debate begin.

 0,Just before Thursday’s vice-presidential debate four independent groups have been trying to seed public opinion by running advertisements that are critical of Gov. Sarah Palin and Senator John McCain.Campaign Money Watch a watchdog group produced a spot focusing on Mr. McCain’s involvement in the Keating Five scandal in which Mr. McCain of Arizona was accused of improperly exerting influence on regulators on behalf of Charles Keating the high-flying financier and campaign contributor whose savings and loan collapse cost taxpayers $2 billion.The spot is fairly tame but dredges up a scandal that Mr. McCain would rather forget particularly as Americans are struggling to accept the government’s proposed $700 billion bailout of financial institutions.The Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund is behind a graphic 60-second advertisement attacking Ms. Palin’s stance on the aerial hunting of wolves.“As Alaska governor Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife” a narrator says.The spot then follows with what appears to be video from a wolf hunt showing grainy images of two men in a small plane who shoot a wolf from the air. The wolf then barrels into the ground writhing in pain on the snow.The advertisement concludes with a picture of a dead wolf hanging from the wing of a plane beneath the text “Do we really want a Vice President who champions such savagery?”Planned Parenthood has produced a 30-second spot focusing on Ms. Palin’s tenure as mayor of Wasilla Alaska.It begins with a shot of a young dark-haired woman named Gretchen who identifies herself as a rape victim.The narrator begins “Under Mayor Sarah Palin women like Gretchen were forced to pay up to $1200 for the emergency exams used to prosecute their attackers.”Independent fact-checkers have examined the controversy over rape kits. PolitiFact the fact-checking arm of The St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly found that while the policy was in place while Ms. Palin was mayor there is no evidence that she directly endorsed the policy nor that she ever commented on the policy.Perhaps the harshest of the advertisements is a 30-second spot produced by the 85000-member California Nurses Association and running in closely contested states. It is a full-fledged swipe at Mr. McCain’s age and health and a direct attack on Ms. Palin’s readiness to take over as president if necessary.At one point the spot shows Mr. McCain before a black background and a pulsing signal from a heart-rate monitor that turns into a flat line.“One heartbeat one heartbeat one heartbeat away” a chorus cheerfully sings.Even opponents of Mr. McCain are likely to find such a graphic reference to his health offensive undermining the message of the advertisement.

 9,The Federal Highway Administration is banning as of Thursday all further installation of two common kinds of guardrail along Government-financed highways after determining that the guardrails cause full-size pickup trucks to roll over in tests.Pickup trucks are designed to climb up and over obstacles a feature that is useful on muddy farms and construction sites but can be dangerous when they hit guardrails. Most sport utility vehicles are based on pickup designs and some ride even higher off the ground leading many researchers to suspect that sport utility vehicles may also fare poorly when they strike guardrails. But few tests have been done with such vehicles which have only recently become popular so nobody knows whether they pose a problem.State and Federal officials said there were no plans to replace hundreds of thousands of miles of guardrails because of the cost.About 15000 Americans are killed each year when their vehicles leave the road. About 1100 of these deaths occur in crashes that begin when vehicles hit guardrails. Many other deaths occur in crashes that begin on the road and then send one or more vehicles into the guardrails but the Government lacks accurate statistics on these crashes.

 9,The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission has been given a preliminary triple-A rating by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. It is the first United States shelf offering by a Japanese company to be rated.The Japanese company will be issuing bonds totaling 400 billion yen (about $3.2 billion now) over a one-year period. The proceeds will be used to buy property and equipment.Nippon Telegraph was converted from a Government-owned domestic telecommunications monopoly to a private company in April 1985. A recently completed third public offering of 1.5 million shares has reduced the Government's ownership to about 65 percent. The Government is required to own at least one-third of Nippon's outstanding shares.

A Decline in AugustThe November gain was the poorest performance since orders fell 1.4 percent in August.Some economists said they were particularly concerned about an 18.5 percent plunge in orders for computers and other office equipment suggesting that businesses might be showing increased caution about spending.

 0,Here is what we know about the economy and in particular the jobs situation.Employers are adding workers at a fairly sluggish clip at a pace of about 146000 jobs a month in the past three months. That’s probably more jobs than is necessary to keep the unemployment rate stable given the natural growth in the size of the labor market. But it is fewer jobs than is necessary to pull the unemployment rate down from its elevated level of 7.8 percent very quickly.Of late consumers have been feeling better. Home prices have bottomed out in many markets and are picking up in many others. The ranks of the jobless have shrunken and millions of workers are seeing their wages increase though not by much. Households have worked their way through the worst of the “deleveraging process.” The campaign seems to be having an effect too: Democrats are feeling especially good.But businesses are feeling worse. Executives are very concerned about the “fiscal cliff” the huge tax increases and spending cuts looming in January. Manufacturing and exports two of the bright spots in the recovery have weakened of late. Overall growth in the American economy remains sluggish and the major emerging-market countries that fueled the global rebound from the recession have cooled off.Friday’s jobs report for October — the consensus forecast of economists according to Bloomberg is a net gain of 125000 jobs — will be met with a deluge of political spin and hyperbolic analysis. Campaigns and their surrogates are eagerly awaiting the numbers their narratives pre-written and their talking points sharp.Surrogates for Mitt Romney’s campaign will argue that the current pace of jobs growth is too slow to bring us anywhere close to full employment any time soon. They will argue that the recovery is anemic in historical terms and that households are still feeling extraordinary pain. They will pick out especially weak numbers in payrolls or wages or employment in certain sectors.Administration officials and advisers to President Obama’s campaign will argue that the economy is slowly but surely recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression. They will argue that the economy is adding jobs steadily with increases in private-sector payrolls for the past 31 months — probably 32 months as of Friday’s report. They will pull out especially strong numbers in payrolls or wages or employment in certain sectors.But it is highly unlikely that Friday’s jobs report will do much to change our understanding of the current state of the broader economy — even if the numbers come in surprisingly high or surprisingly low as they often do given the noisiness of the data.
 9,BUSINESS travelers worldwide are increasingly embracing the Internet to research and book their flights an annual survey by the International Air Transport Association has found.Almost two-thirds of the survey's approximately 1000 respondents from Europe North America and the Asia-Pacific region said they used the Internet to find flight information a 50 percent increase over the survey's results from two years ago. In some cases IATA compares the current results with year-earlier figures in others with figures from 1997.Not surprisingly North American business travelers -- who made up approximately one-third of the group surveyed -- were the heaviest users of the Internet for flight research; 70 percent of this group said they went on-line to do research an increase of 27 percent over 1997. Such use grew at an even greater rate among European travelers (an increase of 68 percent over 1997) and Asian travelers (an increase of 63 percent).Over all the number of travelers using the Internet to actually book a trip has almost doubled from 9 percent in IATA's 1998 poll to 17 percent this year. One in 10 of those surveyed said they made flight reservations online weekly one-fifth use the Internet monthly to book while almost 40 percent make online bookings every few months.

 9,The last five years have been precarious ones for Doris Dillems's New Friends Place nursery school and day care center at 130 Greene Street. Rent increases and legal fees racked up in her struggle to hold on to her ground-floor space have helped to drain her resources. This month she must leave the space where for the last 18 years she has operated one of the few day care centers in SoHo. The landlord wants to sell it and she says she cannot afford to stay in the area. ''I'm going under unless I get some help'' she said.Already because of the uncertainty some of the parents of children in New Friends are reluctantly making other arrangements. ''It's a huge hardship for parents and for the kids'' said Faye Ran-Moseley a 25-year-resident of SoHo and teacher at Audrey Cohen College who is looking into alternative plans for her 3-year-old daughter. ''For a working mother these things are the foundations of your life.''Other past and present clients say Ms. Dillems has molded the day care center which serves up to 40 children ages 2 through 5 to suit the sometimes erratic SoHo artist's schedule. ''She loves artists and she responds to their way of life'' said Tsipi Ben-Haim director of City Arts a SoHo-based nonprofit arts education group whose son went to New Friends.In return some SoHo artists are attempting to rescue New Friends by donating artwork for an auction to raise money for the school to pay for a new home in the area which they say is short on affordable day care. The auction is scheduled to be held at 139 Greene Street at Space Untitled from Thursday to June 10. City Arts is sponsoring the effort and the Buhl Foundation a nonprofit educational foundation has promised to match whatever money is raised.

 0,Today alone eight new fires were reported scattered throughout the region and Ms. Barrett said overworked and exhausted firefighters would soon have to be rotated off duty for rest. She said officials would also have to be selective about where they put their stretched resources trying to control fires of less than 10 acres as quickly as possible in what is known as ''initial attack'' to keep them from spreading and eventually letting some isolated areas burn.''As much as we worry about the fires there's not a blade of grass or a tree out there that's important as the lives of our firefighters'' Ms. Barrett said.Except for a training accident in Alaska there have been no firefighter fatalities in forest fires this year.The fire in the Sequoia forest a habitat for California spotted owls is in an isolated area west of California Route 395. Eleven firefighters there have suffered injuries all minor. Nine water-spraying helicopters and eight fixed-wing aircraft dumping flame-retardant chemicals are being used to supplement the efforts of firefighters on the ground said Doug Johnston an engineer with the Fire Department of neighboring Kern County who was one of those called to the scene to help attack the blaze.''The estimate now is that it won't be fully controlled for about two weeks'' Mr. Johnston said speaking by telephone from a regional command center in the town of Kernville. ''Our weather is going to change on us with thunderstorms forecast. If we could get some precipitation that would be good. But the history of this area is you just get lightning with no rain.''
 9,In the end the burdens were more than the Buffalo Bills could bear.There was the weight of failure in the previous two Super Bowls and the weight of expectations for Super Bowl XXVII yesterday. And if that wasn't enough the Dallas Cowboys quickly brought their own pressure to bear forcing nine Buffalo turnovers as they humiliated the Bills 52-17.The Bills whose turnovers set a Super Bowl record were left to make history as the first team to lose three consecutive Super Bowls.Jim Kelly the Buffalo quarterback had two passes intercepted before he was forced out of the game in the second quarter. That brought on Frank Reich architect of the greatest comeback in college football history and recently pro football's greatest -- a playoff victory over Houston in which the Bills rallied from 32 points down.But yesterday in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena Calif. it was not to be. Troy Aikman's four touchdown passes revived the glory of the Dallas Cowboys a team that had not been to the Super Bowl in 14 years. Presiding over it all was Jimmy Johnson who in his fourth year as the Cowboys' coach became the only man to lead a college team the University of Miami to a national championship and a pro football team to a Super Bowl victory.

 0,A visit to one of this restaurant's tatami rooms is like a quick trip to Japan. Here some of the most exquisite kaiseki cuisine can be experienced in a serene atmosphere. Kaiseki cuisine associated with the tea ceremony is food for the soul as well as the body meant to feed the eye with its beauty and the spirit with its meaning.

Sugiyama*** [Rating: 3 stars](212) 956-0670251 West 55th StreetManhattan$$$$ All major cardsThe food is so extraordinary at this tiny restaurant that a visit feels like a dreamy voyage to Japan.

This artful food makes no concessions to American prejudices. Splendid sushi is a part of each meal but there are often tiny crabs no larger than a fingernail (you pop the whole creature into your mouth) lily roots and ginger buds. The meal often begins with ankimo the smooth Japanese version of foie gras (actually monkfish liver) served with a tiny wooden spoon. Most meals continue with zensai beautiful little appetizers arranged with great delicacy then an assortment of sashimi then perhaps rich decadent black cod marinated in sake lees. The meal invariably closes with miso soup pickles and rice.11.

The zangetsu and other pastries are delicate delicious and unforgettable.
 9,NEITHER Hugh Wolff the music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra nor Michael Torke the composer whose new piece opens the ensemble's New Jersey concerts next week would bruit it about that they are on the brink of wider horizons. But these private hopes have already taken form in the minds of admirers who are happy to blow their cover.Mr. Wolff a former leader of the New Jersey Symphony is visiting next week on a tour with the St. Paul group. Next year is to be his last with that ensemble and ostensibly he leaves without a future position. He'll just float around the scene as Kurt Masur's contract with the New York Philharmonic expires; as the Philadelphia Orchestra rolls over Wolfgang Sawallisch's contract; as Seiji Ozawa battles for artistic control of the Boston Symphony Orchestra where he has been dug in for what some say is too long.Mr. Wolff 45 is a gifted cosmopolitan American in a time when the music world is asking why more American orchestras don't have American leaders. Paris born and Harvard trained (like Yo-Yo Ma) he studied composition with Messiaen and has guest-conducted every one of this country's first-rank orchestras.Next week's concerts in Morristown and Princeton show off Mr. Wolff as a classicist and an American adventurer. Beethoven's Symphony No. 8 and Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor both from the heart of the repertory are preceded by Michael Torke's ''Lucent Variations'' a 15-minute commissioned work introduced in St. Paul only a few weeks ago.
 0,Mark Lennihan/Associated PressMorgan Stanley which has not had much joy in a rough year for Wall Street had reason to celebrate on Wednesday.As the lead underwriter on Facebook’s initial public offering the firm will reap not only millions of dollars in fees but more important the bragging rights that come with what bankers described as a once-in-a-generation event.At Facebook it had been clear for some time that Morgan Stanley would help shepherd the company to the public markets.The Wall Street firm had led the prominent I.P.O.’s of LinkedIn Groupon and Zynga. And Michael Grimes the leader of Morgan Stanley’s office in Menlo Park Calif. had steered the firm’s tech team through the dot-com bust and forged relationships with the venture capital firms that have incubated today’s tech giants.So a vexing question for Facebook executives as they prepared to go public was: What sort of role should go to Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley’s chief rival in winning I.P.O. assignments?Goldman’s reputation has taken serious hits in recent years. A series of events from a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in 2010 that accused the firm of creating a mortgage product that was intended to fail to Goldman’s handling of a $1.5 billion investment in Facebook itself last year have led to criticism of the firm.Facebook executives say people briefed on the matter weighed how the bank’s record might affect its own reputation. So while many people still expected Goldman to be the runner-up among underwriters it was JPMorgan Chase that took the No. 2 spot in the Facebook prospectus’s listing on Wednesday.It was surprising given that JPMorgan is relatively untested in leading technology I.P.O.’s but helps illustrate the firm’s rise in recent years. The bank had played a full-court press to win over Facebook with its chief executive Jamie Dimon forming a rapport with Facebook’s chief operating office Sheryl Sandberg. The bank’s top deal-maker James B. Lee Jr. meanwhile regularly led pitches to Facebook executives.One advantage was JPMorgan’s strength as a lender having helped create a credit facility that provided Facebook with ample cash.Still the banks were in the dark about whether they stood in Facebook’s good graces until a few weeks ago. Three other firms round out the underwriting syndicate so far: Bank of America–Merrill Lynch Barclays Capital and Allen & Company.In a show of support for their prospective client bankers from the top three underwriters had set up Facebook accounts despite firm policies banning the use of social networks at the office.“This is a great thing for people’s tech practices” Peter Falvey a managing director at Morgan Keegan said. “It’s such a unique asset and such a highly anticipated offering that it has significant franchise value.”Such is Facebook’s prominence that banks are willing to work for a much lower fee than usual. The company is expected to pay its advisers a fee as low as 1 percent of proceeds raised according to a person briefed on the matter. That would be far below the norm of 3 to 7 percent though the size of Facebook’s offering guarantees a still-handsome payout.That low fee is reminiscent of what General Motors paid in its “re-I.P.O.” in the fall of 2010: an eye-popping 0.75 percent. There however the selling shareholder was the federal government.With an expected valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion Facebook will be among the biggest companies to seek the public markets in recent memory. Recent trades on Sharespost a secondary market for Facebook stock valued the company at as much as $89 billion.Even with a fund-raising target of $5 billion — a preliminary figure that will almost surely grow over time — Facebook’s offering is more than twice as big as Google’s $1.9 billion initial offering nearly eight years ago.The road to landing a coveted underwriting role began years ago according to people briefed on the matter. It meant forming relationships with Facebook’s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg who viewed Wall Street bankers with some skepticism.It also meant winning over top executives like Ms. Sandberg and Facebook’s finance chief David Ebersman who would oversee the I.P.O. process. Bankers also courted influential Facebook investors like James W. Breyer of Accel Partners and Yuri Milner of DST Global.Bankers and analysts had long assumed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the front-runners. Together the two firms underwrote nearly 14 percent of I.P.O.’s worldwide last year raising $22.3 billion in proceeds for their clients according to data from Thomson Reuters. Goldman ranked first with 54 offerings that raised $11.9 billion.Yet within Silicon Valley Morgan Stanley has a nearly matchless reputation. In making their pitch to Facebook to be lead underwriter Morgan Stanley bankers promoted their firm’s ability to sell huge amounts of stock through its retail brokerage network — an ability that appealed to Facebook according to a person briefed on the matter.Goldman had its own cards to play having also worked on Groupon and Zynga. It also led a $500 million investment in Facebook last year and sold an additional $1 billion worth of stock to wealthy foreign private clients. But the latter led to embarrassing questions about potential securities regulation violations hamstringing Goldman’s efforts.Evelyn M. Rusli contributed reporting.

 9,"We're starting to be able to pick up the defensive momentum the way we were able to under Coach Pitino" said Mark Jackson who watched from the bench as rookie Greg Anthony used his quick feet to defend against Isiah Thomas for all but the final seconds of the fourth quarter. "The defense is different because we don't go full-court. But we're starting to be able to pick it up a notch in the half-court and at important times in the game."Before anyone gets carried away it would be wise to consider who the competition was. The fading Pistons (7-9) two-time National Basketball Association champions still bring an admirable ethic to work but appear to have fallen a couple of crucial notches in their levels of chemistry and execution.Even what Knicks Coach Pat Riley described as their "tactics" didn't help them yesterday. Early in the second quarter with Ewing posting up in the lane against Bill Laimbeer Laimbeer fell backward and to the floor in small part from minimal contact and in large part from one of his notorious flops. Laimbeer got the call and Ewing a techical foul but John Salley fell over Laimbeer and injured his left knee. The 7-foot front courtman Detroit's most active shot-blocking presence was suspected to have suffered damage to his anterior cruciate ligament.It also didn't help the Pistons nor hurt the Knicks' growing defensive egos that small forward Mark Aguirre after piling up 18 first-half points injured his right elbow and played only the first few minutes of the third quarter. That left Detroit's offense in the hands of Thomas who scored 17 points and his slumping backcourt partner Joe Dumars who had 15. Of Us and ThemBehind Gerald Wilkins's 8 points to close the second quarter the Knicks reduced Detroit's lead to a workable 56-48. Then the Pistons committed a rash of early third-quarter fouls worked their way into the penalty at the 9:19 mark and paid for it. As the Knicks took their 60-56 lead 8 of their 12 points came at the line.
