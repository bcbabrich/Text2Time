0,SHAPIRO--Pauline. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a cherished long-time friend who with her beloved husband the late Louis Shapiro was a YU Guardian who gave major support to Yeshiva University. Among their many contributions were the establishment of a large Reading Room in the Mendel Gottesman Library Scholarship Funds in their honor and in tribute to several friends and sponsorship of Yeshiva College publications and of the annual Mishnayos Bekiyus Competition of the YU High School for Boys. Her kindness and compassion and bravery in the face of adversity made her a true "Ayshet Chayil". Heartfelt condolences are extended to her children Martin (and Pat) Shapiro Harvey Shapiro Sheila (and Mark) Rosler her grandchildren and her great granddaughter. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel President Norman Lamm Chancellor Morry J. Weiss Chairman Board of Trustees
1,Most presidents will at some point benefit from a surging economy and stock market but none has claimed more credit for them than Donald J. Trump as he did again during this week’s State of the Union address. Among the highlights:• “$8 trillion and more” in stock market gains.• “2.4 million new jobs” created since his election.• “Over 3 million workers have gotten tax-cut bonuses” and “rising wages.”• All thanks to “the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.”Since the president has frequently complained that the media denies him credit for any of this I thought it only fair to assess the degree to which the undeniably strong economy low unemployment and surging stock market are because of Mr. Trump’s achievements notably his sweeping tax bill.It turns out that’s no easy task especially since Mr. Trump has only been president for a year and the tax legislation is little more than a month old. Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagan’s 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passage.“It’s not like chemistry or physics where you can do a controlled experiment and change one variable” said Joel Slemrod professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan and co-author of a seminal study of the economic impact of the 1986 tax reform act. “We can never be entirely sure because we don’t know what would have happened without the tax act.”
1,Mr. Moulton is in particularly bad shape: He has been in the race for more than two months but has not reached 1 percent in a single qualifying poll according to the Times analysis. Aside from Mr. Sestak who announced his campaign less than two weeks ago Mr. Moulton is the only candidate in the 24-person field with this dubious distinction.[Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren gained ground in a series of post-debate polls.]The 14 candidates who have locked in a spot on the July debate stage by qualifying through both donors and polling in alphabetical order are: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Ind.; the former housing secretary Julián Castro; Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Kamala Harris of California; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; the self-help author Marianne Williamson; and the former tech executive Andrew Yang.Who could get cut from the third debate?An even larger group of candidates is expected to be left off the stage for the third debate in September. The D.N.C. raised the qualification thresholds for it significantly.Candidates will need to have at least 130000 donors and earn 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls. And this time they will have to meet both standards to make the cut.We surveyed the campaigns last month and while most did not provide data on unique donors a few did. Based on that information and what has been publicly released by the campaigns we know that seven candidates have already met the donor requirement.[Which presidential candidates raised the most money this spring?]Five of those seven — Mr. Biden Mr. Buttigieg Ms. Harris Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren — have routinely eclipsed 2 percent support in the polls and will presumably meet the polling requirement with ease. They are all but certain to earn a spot on the stage in September. A sixth Mr. O’Rourke also has a track record of achieving 2 percent or higher in the polls but a pair of post-debate surveys this week had him at 1 percent.Mr. Yang’s campaign announced Monday that he had also exceeded 130000 donors making him the seventh candidate to do so. But Mr. Yang’s support in the polls has wobbled between 0 and 2 percent and it is not clear whether he will achieve 2 percent four times in a two-month window.

1,There are three levels of heat in the spice rubs at Brooklyn Suya starting with mild which is in fact hot. Not too hot just enough to open the pores and bring a faint sheen to the skin. It’s the next level up that slows you down insists you take your time and pause every few bites.The highest level says stop. The mouth turns to kindling. A small sun is born.“Are you sure?” the woman behind the counter said doubtfully when I requested the highest. “Me I stick to the lowest.”In Nigeria suya is street food: meat cut thin slapped with a dry spice rub dominated by ginger peanuts and chiles then skewered and charred on an often improvised grill and handed over in newspaper gone dark with oil.So it feels right to eat it on the street in Crown Heights Brooklyn even on the most brutal of summer days sitting hunched at the lone teetering tiny table on the sidewalk. Brooklyn Suya opened here as a pop-up last August; the owners Hema Agwu and Folusho Adeyemo signed a lease in February.

0,Etta James a hefty 63-year-old who has been singing professionally since she was a teenager was helped onto the stage at the B. B. King Blues Club by an attendant on Thursday night and she performed seated. She had the haughty jaded expression of an empress overseeing workaday matters as if she took her attentive band and the adoring audience for granted. And though her most recent album ''Blue Gardenia'' (Private Music/BMG) is a set of jazz standards she didn't sing any of them. Instead her set stuck to songs she may have performed thousands of times mostly her hits from the 1950's and 1960's.Yet on Thursday night the beginning of a three-night stand on the first anniversary of the club (at 243 West 42nd Street in Manhattan) Ms. James's routine reached into some essence of American music: the soul alchemy of sorrow laughter carnality fury loss and hope.Ms. James's voice remembers every stage of her life. She encompasses coy teenager and amorous woman heartbroken lover and spiteful victim party girl and desperate addict. Her 1995 autobiography ''Rage to Survive'' detailed her struggles with men drugs and the music business but her singing tells more.She wields her voice with the timing of a falcon breezing aloft and then darting directly and implacably toward its target. She flirts sobs chuckles taunts growls; she moans with satisfaction and with pain. In one song she sings quick glancing lines skimming them across a steady vamp; in the next she lingers over words connecting them in long caressing phrases. As she does even her familiar songs illuminate the emotional turmoil that they sum up so concisely.

9,"I don't feel like it was a raw deal for me" Hector said. "With six weeks I should be ready to go."Hector said that he's leaving open the possibility that the Jets will call him back but he said there were no guarantees offered when he reached his injury settlement with team officials this morning."If they feel like after six weeks I'm 100 percent healthy and I can help the team then they'll call me back" Hector said.Coslet said the thought of having Hector return about the middle of the season was in the back of the Jets officials' minds when they made the injury settlement. Coslet said the team's situation would dictate whether Hector would be brought back at the end of six weeks.Hector said he hadn't thought about the possibility of being picked up by another team. That is unlikely since he has an injury that will require six weeks to heal. If he does not return to the Jets he will be remembered for his performance against Miami in the final game of last season. Coming off the bench and subbing for an injured Thomas Hector had 13 carries for 132 yards and helped put the Jets in the playoffs for the first time since 1985.Heading into training camp this year Hector was facing stiff competition for the fourth running-back spot from A. B. Brown who was coming off a knee injury and Chaffey a big fullback who blocks and catches well. When Brown was cut last week Hector realized he was vulnerable.With Taylor and Stargell being cut the Jets no longer have any of their draft picks from the second through the sixth round of the 1990 draft.

8,In another step toward liquidation the board of the Des Moines Register and Tribune Company today approved the sale of four radio stations for $11.6 million.Ackerley Communications Inc. of Seattle will acquire KSGO-AM and FM in Portland Ore. for $6 million and the Price Communications Corporation of New York will buy WIBA- AM and FM in Madison Wis. for approximately $5.6 million.With the sale of the four stations the company will have disposed of $290 million of assets.But the board made no decision on the disposal of the Register and Tribune's 430000 shares - representing 14.3 percent ownership - of the Cowles Media Company whose holdings include the Minneapolis Star and Tribune and other smaller papers.The Cowles stock is the Register and Tribune's only significant asset that has not been sold and its value is thought to depend largely upon whether it is sold as a block or dispersed to shareholders. Cowles stock which is traded through broker transactions though the company is private has recently sold for $80 a share according to Robert Gales of Piper Jaffray & Hopwood a brokerage firm in Minneapolis.

1,PhotoAfter a big Memorial Day weekend brought a strong end to a record-breaking season Broadway’s box office sales sagged a bit last week.The post-holiday comedown — not unexpected given that fewer tourists were in town — meant that most of the shows vying for Tony Awards saw a drop in grosses. The Tonys will be presented on Sunday.There were still 10 shows that grossed more than $1 million in the week that ended May 31 including the hit plays “Fish in the Dark” and “The Audience”; the new musicals “An American in Paris” “Something Rotten!” “The King and I” and “Finding Neverland”; and four longer-running hits “The Lion King” “Wicked” “Aladdin” and “The Book of Mormon.”But several shows that had topped $1 million the previous week dropped below that mark last week including “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” “Kinky Boots” and “The Phantom of the Opera.”Among the contenders for the best new musical Tony three had news to brag about: “American in Paris” continues to pull in the biggest box office “Something Rotten!” saw the biggest increase in grosses and “Fun Home” had the most packed houses. That show bested even “The Book of Mormon” by reporting 103 percent capacity audiences meaning that not only was every seat taken but there were substantial standing-room attendees as well.The fourth nominee “The Visit” continues to lag at the box office taking in $149023 which is only 20 percent of its potential.The first show to open in the new Broadway season the comedy “An Act of God” written by David Javerbaum and starring Jim Parsons reported a healthy $693379 gross in four previews and four regular performances. That was down from the previous week reflecting the fact that the show gave away tickets on opening night and to critics.

0,Brendan Behan the loquacious Irish novelist and playwright who died in 1964 of diabetes complicated by alcoholism (he was only 41) once jokingly described himself as ''a drinker with a writing problem.'' Peter Sheridan's gentle misty-eyed screen adaptation of Behan's coming-of-age novel ''Borstal Boy'' barely hints at the marathon toper to come in a scene in which the teenage Brendan gets pleasantly tipsy on cider.The film set in the early 1940's is a likable rites-of-passage memory piece doused in period nostalgia including the prominent use of vintage Movietone newsreels to mark the events of World War II. While incarcerated in a Borstal (a British reform school) the teenage Brendan discovered the theater by reading Oscar Wilde stood up to the institution's resident bully tried and failed to escape and formed two romantic relationships. By the end of the film he has blossomed from an introverted rebel into an endearing self-assured future Great Writer.Most of the movie is set in the reform school in East Anglia where Brendan was incarcerated after being caught taking explosives into Liverpool. A fervent Irish republican he was legally too young at 16 to be sent to a regular prison. As depicted in the movie the institution lacks the ominous aura of a modern reform school and looks less like a penal institution than a Spartan summer camp. Although violence erupts there it isn't endemic to the school whose stern but kindly warden Joyce (Michael York) genuinely cares about the young men under his charge.As played by the American actor Shawn Hatosy Brendan comes across as a wholesome sensitive idealist with a streak of sexual ambiguity. The movie puts a glowing romantic spin on Brendan's attraction to his best friend Charlie Millwall (Danny Dyer) a sailor who although openly gay is not seriously harassed. When the two exchange a kiss it is a liberating moment unencumbered by guilt or shame. Nor does that kiss have any effect on Brendan's deepening passion for Joyce's daughter Liz (Eva Birthistle) who returns his affection. (Behan eventually married another woman in 1955.)
0,Search for the word “refund” on NYTimes.com and you’ll find articles about people getting their money back for everything from taxes to unused Metrocards to an Oasis concert.But theater tickets?In an unusual move patrons at recent performances of a play in Chicago called “El Grito del Bronx” were offered refunds if they weren’t satisfied with the show. Of the approximately 3000 people who saw the production during its 20-performance run only 14 asked for — and got — their money back.The program sparked much chatter in Chicago theater circles and in the blogosphere. Some people thought the program was a refreshing way for theater companies to attract new audiences and produce difficult works. Others thought it negatively commodified the theatergoing experience.What do you think? Under what circumstances should a theater offer money-back guarantees to patrons? Post your comments here.

1,Mr. Gatling’s exoneration will be the 20th time in the last two years that the Conviction Review Unit has helped to clear defendants found guilty in Brooklyn of crimes they did not commit. Charles J. Hynes began a similar effort as the district attorney in 2011 but when his successor Ken Thompson took office in 2014 he renamed the unit and put his support squarely behind it. The review unit initially focused on cases connected to one detective Louis Scarcella whose alleged misconduct has called into question nearly 50 murder cases. But as news of the unit’s work has spread its reach has widened to include cases like Mr. Gatling’s.Mr. Gatling’s ordeal began on Oct. 15 1963 when a man armed with a shotgun burst into the home of Lawrence Rothbort an artist who lived on Bedford Avenue with his wife Marlene and their two children a 6-year-old boy and an infant daughter. According to police reports and later testimony at trial the man demanded money from Mr. Rothbort. When the artist refused the gunman shot him in the chest.During the investigation suspicion first fell on Mr. Gatling when one of the Rothborts’ neighbors a felon named Grady Reaves informed the police that he had seen Mr. Gatling in the area just minutes after the shooting. When Mr. Gatling was interviewed by detectives in the 80th Precinct (which was later absorbed by another precinct) he told them that he had been paying his rent at the time — a fact that his landlord eventually confirmed. A few hours into the interview Mr. Gatling’s lawyer called the station house but the detectives told him that he could not see his client until the questioning was complete court papers say.Image Mr. Gatling in a portrait taken while he was in prison.That same evening Mr. Gatling who was 6-foot-1 was placed in a lineup with three notably shorter men. Mrs. Rothbort was called in to identify him but did not pick him out even though court papers say the detectives directed her to focus on “the tall one.”
8,Precious metals futures soared yesterday after a dramatic late rally caused frenzied buying among the large number of traders who had been betting on a decline in the prices of gold silver and especially platinum in recent weeks.Indeed platinum was the catalyst that touched off the turnabout with the active nearby deliveries soaring the daily permissible limit on the New York Mercantile Exchange.At the close the unrestricted spot March platinum futures were up $25.30 an ounce to $475 while the more active April delivery rose the daily limit of $25 also to $475.Experts said the late surge in platinum largely reflected rising concern about the political situation in South Africa a major producer of the metal.

0,Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Sara Krulwich/The New York Times The Broadway cast of “Billy Elliot the Musical” is about to lose another cast member who plays the title character — only this time it’s someone who has reached the age of majority. Stephen Hanna the former New York City Ballet dancer who portrays the role of Billy’s older self in that musical will rejoin the company of City Ballet as a guest artist for its coming 2009-2010 winter season. In a news release City Ballet said on Thursday that Mr. Hanna who departed for the Broadway show last year will assume his former rank as principal dancer when he returns to the company. Mr. Hanna joined the corps of City Ballet in 1997; he was promoted to soloist in 2004 and made a principal dancer in 2005. A press representative for City Ballet said that Mr. Hanna would depart “Billy Elliot” at the end of October. A representative for the Broadway musical confirmed Mr. Hanna’s departure and said that a replacement for him had not yet been determined.
0,Aetna Inc. and the ING Group the Dutch financial services company said yesterday that they were discussing a new offer from ING to buy Aetna's financial and international divisions.

0,Bowing to reality but still confident about growth executives of Home Depot Inc. reduced the company's expected earnings growth yesterday to an increase of 18 to 20 percent a year for the next three years. Last year they had predicted a growth rate of 23 percent to 25 percent for the company.The announcement came at the company's annual meeting for Wall Street analysts and investors in Atlanta where Home Depot the country's biggest home-improvement chain is based. Investors appeared to like the news driving shares of Home Depot up $2.63 to $46.65 in the heaviest trading since September.''It was a relief rally'' said Colin McGranahan a retail analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''The numbers were what I expected and pretty much what the market expected.''It was the first meeting led by the chairman and chief executive Robert L. Nardelli who replaced Home Depot's founders less than a year ago after a long career at General Electric. Like many executives in retail Mr. Nardelli watched the ground shift beneath him as the sputtering economy and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 made shoppers newly cost-conscious and reluctant to make any but the most essential purchases. That shift has required the company to embrace a plan of action that makes cost cutting as important as rapid expansion.

9,She ended up at Harvard University in culture shock. ''I spent the first week almost locked in my room'' Ms. Charo said. For once she had bought clothes to replace her hand-me-downs. But she said ''we're talking Kmart.''Appearance was only part of it. ''I really didn't know how to behave'' Ms. Charo said. The other freshmen ''kept talking about things I had no experience with.'' They spoke about vacations in Europe when she had never been on an airplane.''To me Europe was 'the other side.' That was the immigrant phrase.''Soon she said she retreated to what had worked in Flatbush her own version of cool. Her attitude was ''I'm rough and tough from Brooklyn with a chip on my shoulder.'' Ms. Charo cringes to think about it. ''I was so irritating to everyone'' she recalled. ''I was so tedious. I'm just grateful that some of the friends I made stuck with me as I worked through this stage.''Inspired by her junior high school teacher she majored in biology. ''If Mr. Miller is still out there he should know that he's the man who determined the course of my life'' Ms. Charo said. But her first two years were a struggle as she gradually learned how to study and what was required to get good grades at Harvard.After a few summers in biology laboratories and a few too many laboratory courses Ms. Charo finally admitted to herself that she just did not enjoy that kind of work and drifted into a major that she felt was still acceptable: behavioral evolution and evolutionary theory. At the same time she took some law courses and was fascinated but wary and almost embarrassed to think about becoming a lawyer.''To me law school was a real drop in status from science'' Ms. Charo said. ''I thought that scientists were the only people who create something new. Everyone else is massaging existing data.''Torn between law school and graduate school she compromised -- she took the Law School Admissions Test and the Graduate Record Exam. Her score on the Graduate Record Exam used by graduate schools in deciding whom to admit was ''respectable'' Ms. Charo said. Her score on the law school examination she said was ''stellar.''
1,Fans and pundits will surely debate the extent and the quality of the Knicks’ progress this season.They have a winning record (but just barely).They are on a pace to make the playoffs (as a lower seed).They might win a first-round series (though it seems unlikely).They have an undisputed star in Amar’e Stoudemire (but he is not LeBron James).Yet the progress is both tangible and indisputable and a credit to Donnie Walsh the team president who over two years dismantled a dysfunctional overpaid lineup and replaced it with a cohesive respectable reasonably priced team.As Walsh awaits word about his future it is instructive to look back to the roster he was handed on April 1 2008 which may look even worse in retrospect than it did at the time.Six of the 15 players Walsh inherited are out of the league — not counting Eddy Curry who might as well be. Three others are on N.B.A. rosters but barely playing. That leaves only five players of any significance.Without further ado welcome to “The Isiah-era Knicks: Where are they now?”Thriving MostlyZach Randolph Memphis Grizzlies Had a brief and forgettable stopover with the Los Angeles Clippers. Now producing the usual gaudy numbers for Memphis: 20 points and a career-best 13.2 rebounds a game. Has not made the playoffs or been part of a winning team though the Grizzlies have a shot at the eighth seed in the West. Salary in 2008: $13.3 million. Current salary: $17.3 million. How he left: Traded (with Mardy Collins) to Clippers for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas on Nov. 21 2008.Jamal Crawford Atlanta Hawks Won the Sixth Man of the Year award last season simultaneously proving that Crawford was a) one of the better players Isiah Thomas acquired and b) was miscast by Thomas as a starting guard and No. 1 scoring option. Remains a key reserve for playoff-bound Hawks but scoring and shooting percentages have dipped to 15.9 points and 43 percent. Salary in 2008: $7.9 million. Current salary: $10.1 million. How he left: Traded to Warriors for Al Harrington on Nov. 21 2008.David Lee Golden State Warriors Named an All-Star in final Knicks season albeit as an injury replacement. Was the best member of a bad Knicks team averaging 20.2 points and 11.7 rebounds. Now a solid member of a poor Warriors team averaging 16 points and 9.7 rebounds. Salary in 2008: $990000. Current salary: $10.8 million. How he left: In sign-and-trade deal with Warriors for Anthony Randolph Ronny Turiaf and Kelenna Azubuike on July 8 2010.Nate Robinson Boston Celtics Other than Crawford the only Isiah-era Knick to play a major role for a playoff team. Helped fuel Celtics’ Game 4 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010 N.B.A. finals. Now averaging 7.7 points and shooting .412 as the Celtics’ sixth man. Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $4.2 million. How he left: Traded (with Marcus Landry) to Boston for Eddie House Bill Walker and J.R. Giddens on Feb. 18 2010.Wilson Chandler Knicks Thomas’s best parting gift — a talented low-maintenance high-scoring forward who always plays hard and improves every year. Averaging a career-best 17.4 points. Current salary: $2.1 million. Future: A free agent this summer could be used in trade for Carmelo Anthony or let go to make room for Anthony.Approaching IrrelevanceQuentin Richardson Orlando Magic Opened season as a key rotation player became superfluous when Magic acquired Gilbert Arenas and Jason Richardson. Played 57 minutes in January. Salary in 2008: $8.1 million. Current salary: $2.3 million. How he left: Traded to Memphis for Darko Milicic on June 26 2008.Jared Jeffries Houston Rockets Found niche as versatile defender in his final years with Knicks. Niche in Houston is between 13th and 14th seats on the bench. Has made 17 appearances this season averaging 7.8 minutes. (Side note: Thomas upon signing Jeffries said he would “balance the plane ride.”) Salary in 2008: $5.6 million. Current salary: $6.9 million. How he left: Traded to Houston (with Jordan Hill) in three-team deal that brought Tracy McGrady to Knicks on Feb. 18 2010.Renaldo Balkman Denver Nuggets The hustle. The hair. The Rodman-like nose for the ball. There was little to enjoy about these Knicks but Balkman’s frantic energy was something. He is more static now: He has played 44 minutes this season. (Side note: Balkman was drafted one spot ahead of Rajon Rondo in 2006.) Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $1.7 million. How he left: Traded to Denver for Taurean Green Bobby Jones and a second-round pick on July 28 2008. (Jones and Green were later waived.)Eddy Curry Knicks Symbol of an era of overpaid underachievers. Peaked in 2006-7 (19.5 points a game) regressing ever since. Unable to stay healthy or in shape jeopardizing career. Has appeared in 10 games since start of the 2008-9 season. Salary in 2008: $8.9 million. Current salary: $11.3 million. Future: If Knicks cannot trade his expiring contract by Feb. 24 they will probably waive him.Off the GridStephon Marbury Benched by Coach Mike D’Antoni. Refused a buyout. Took a buyout. Joined the Celtics. Played sparingly. Declined to re-sign with Celtics. Wanted better offer. Found no other offers. Went on YouTube. Ate Vaseline. Now playing in China. Salary in 2008: $19 million. How he left: Waived Feb. 24 2009.Jerome James Often injured always jovial rarely in shape. Spent a lot of time on what came to be known as the Jerome James Memorial Stationary Bike. Presumed retired. Salary in 2008: $5.8 million. How he left: Traded (with Tim Thomas Anthony Roberson) to Chicago for Larry Hughes on Feb. 19 2009.Malik Rose Consummate nice guy veteran of two Spurs championship teams tried best to infuse professionalism in a chaotic environment. Now a broadcaster for the Spurs. Salary in 2008: $7.1 million. How he left: Traded to Oklahoma City for Chris Wilcox on Feb. 19 2009.Mardy Collins Steady selfless guard. Not particularly good at anything. Out of league after failing to make Washington Wizards last fall. (Side note: Paul Millsap was still on the board when Collins was drafted in 2006.) Salary in 2008: $967000. How he left: Traded (with Zach Randolph) to Clippers on Nov. 21 2008.Fred Jones Won 2004 slam-dunk contest. Won 23 games in only season with the Knicks. Spent 2008-9 with Clippers. Has not been seen since. Salary in 2008: $3.3 million. How he left: Was not re-signed after 2007-8 season.Randolph Morris When Knicks signed him straight out of college — via little-known loophole — Thomas said Randolph was like an extra first-round pick. Like an extra Mardy Collins. Salary in 2008: $810000. How he left: Was not re-signed after 2007-8 season.

9,April is the cruelest month? Ha! T. S. Eliot obviously never spent August searching for a good movie. The last weeks of summer are the traditional dumping ground for films too weak to go up against midsummer blockbusters. But there are always exceptions and this August brought two of the season's smartest most stylish most entertaining movies. "Desperado" and "The Usual Suspects" both have hunky heroes mazelike plots and slick action: the perfect formula for escapist dog-day pictures."Desperado" owes its flair in equal measure to the director Robert Rodriguez and the star Antonio Banderas. Though the story is a virtual remake of Mr. Rodriguez' done-for-a-pittance "El Mariachi" this story of a violent guitar-playing seeker of justice gains a whole different twist with Mr. Banderas in the title role. He plays up his Latin-lover appeal with flowing hair and what another era would have called bedroom eyes. But "Desperado" shows him to be an actor whose mind is in the right place too.This is a film that pays homage to the old ultra-violent shoot-'em-up genre even as it wallows in "Wild Bunch" gunfights and Mr. Banderas has the wit to make this semi-serious attitude work. In one especially wry scene the hero's lover serenades him while he calmly and comically points his guns at the villains creeping outside their bedroom windows. Though "Desperado" may seem like one more entry in the Tarantino school of smart-guy crime movies Mr. Rodriguez's swift visual style is distinctively his."The Usual Suspects" directed by Bryan Singer also pays homage to caper movies while becoming a sleek addition to the genre. The twisty plot practically defies understanding. It has something to do with stealing $91 million worth of cocaine from a ship and is just lucid enough to keep viewers trailing along after it which is half the fun. The other half is watching a handful of first-rate actors who keep the audience guessing what blunders and doublecrosses they have in mind.

0,A lawyer for the city said that although the city had agreed to send out the directives the city maintains that no new policy of selective-enforcement has ever been instituted and that the increase in arrests merely reflects a sharp increase in the number of contacts between officers and homeless people.''There were more arrests because there was more activity'' the lawyer Gail Donoghue special assistant to the corporation counsel said. She described the directives as ''a confirmation of our existing policy and practice.''''The policy was and is as part of Police Department training and procedures that people are treated the same'' Ms. Donoghue said. ''But we didn't have these things written out.''''It is our policy'' she added. ''We have no reason not to write it down.''A police spokesman had no additional comment.The lawsuit charged that after reports in the news media last fall about a significant increase in the number of homeless people on the streets top police officials directed the Homeless Outreach Unit to change its mission from one of offering services to arrest. The suit said that officers had also been told that they were not to enforce the law in a similar manner against people who were not homeless.The new directives have been read aloud at 10 consecutive roll calls of the Homeless Outreach Unit and the Transit Bureau and distributed to individual officers the documents show.They also offer guidance to members of the Homeless Outreach Unit when carrying out their duties. For example if an officer finds a person stretched out on a subway seat or a park bench the officer must first ''take appropriate corrective action.''

9,Now Mr. Mahathir's favorite hobbyhorse -- controlling capitalism's excesses keeping small countries from being washed out to sea by the ebb and flow of billions of dollars -- is the subtext of half the seminars here in Davos.While almost no one has endorsed the Malaysian solution declaring a nation's currency valueless outside its borders the 73-year-old Prime Minister has come to seek vindication and to delight in the fact that the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury fear others could follow Mr. Mahathir's path.''The U.S. must be more tolerant of the stupidity of Malaysia'' he said. ''Why not leave us to do the wrong things we want to do? What is this talk about freedom and independence if you say I have the power to stop you and I will stop you?''Actually the United States has not exactly said that. But Mr. Mahathir was directly challenged on his own turf in November by Vice President Al Gore who at an Asian economic summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur took up the language of Mr. Anwar and other enemies of Mr. Mahathir's rule openly calling for ''reformasi'' or reform.Mr. Gore's aides are happy that it played well back home that the Vice President in the words of one of his advisers ''took on a tin-pot dictator.''Here in Davos Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Gore steered clear of each other no small trick in a town this small. But Mr. Mahathir spent a good deal of time repairing relations with investors who have cut his country off ever since Malaysia declared that any money invested in the country must stay there for at least one year.Asked over dinner about statements he made to largely Muslim audiences in Malaysia about the role of Jews in causing the global financial crisis he readily admitted that his people ''see a Jewish hand'' in the chaos and he did not appear prepared to challenge that perception.

The site will also take content from MSNBC Telemundo “Today” and the nightly news.“Network news if you will looks different now than it did 20 years ago” Mr. Capus said of the anchors and correspondents. “We’ve got some very high-profile players who reflect the diversity in this country.”

9,In the 1970's Michael Weller established himself as the unofficial biographer of the generation that came of age as flower children chronicling their aspirations and inevitable disillusion in plays like ''Moonchildren'' and ''Loose Ends'' and in the screenplay for the movie of ''Hair.'' In ''Ghost on Fire'' a poignant play suffused with humor Mr. Weller writes their requiem.When we first meet him in the mid-80's Dan Rittman (Lee Sellars) is teaching screenwriting in New York and an affair with a student has put his marriage to Julia (Betsy Aidem) in jeopardy. Suddenly out of the past arrives Neil Toomie (Nelson Avidon) a onetime sidekick to Dan and Julia when they made short documentary films together in their hippie days ''when we believed everyone was important'' as Dan explains at one point. Neil a cameraman who stayed on in California when Dan and Julia abruptly left is now married to a ditsy woman ''from the Bordeaux region of Texas'' and is in New York to work on a movie about ''drug abuse or is it child abuse . . . one of the abuses.''Neil who keeps up a steady glib banter increasingly tinged with bitterness also may have found an Israeli who is willing to bankroll the big feature movie he and Dan always dreamed of making. But Neil also has a secret which is revealed when his wife Michelle (Dannah Chaifetz) arrives from California with some CAT scans showing he has an inoperable brain tumor.''Ghost on Fire'' fills the stage with ably drawn characters: the vacuous but earnest soap opera actor who is so in love with Julia he has started reading philosophy (albeit at a page an hour) so he can carry on a conversation with her; a sex-obsessed doctor of dubious ethics who wants to be a poet; an upstairs neighbor who is still trying to ban the bomb; the Israeli producer with an amusing if imprecise command of English idiom and his leggy but erudite mistress.

0,The death of James E.

Davis the councilman's brother first publicly raged over the killing then promptly announced his desire to run for his brother's seat a decision that upset some members of the extended family. The councilman's mother tugged by grief and a sense of duty has lent public support to her son but has also tried to broker family peace and to contend with an array of politicians and handlers descending on the suddenly high-profile race in central Brooklyn.''It has been difficult'' Thelma Davis the mother of the late councilman said in an interview yesterday. ''But we are a strong family. We support each other.''

9,Twenty-two Civil War and Lincoln scholars and historians released a statement yesterday saying the charges of plagiarism against Prof. Stephen B. Oates "are totally unfounded."The charges were brought at a symposium of the Illinois State Historical Society last fall by Prof. Robert Bray of Illinois Wesleyan University. Professor Bray said parts of Professor Oates's 1977 biography of Lincoln "With Malice Toward None" were plagiarized from "Abraham Lincoln" by Benjamin Thomas which was published in 1952. Professor Oates of the University of Massachussetts at Amherst denied the charges.In a statement released yesterday the 22 scholars and historians said "We find no evidence of the appropriation of either the ideas or the language of other scholars without attribution -- the only legitimate test of plagiarism."Signers of yesterday's statement included C. Vann Woodward of Yale University David Donald of Harvard University James M. McPherson of Princeton University John Hope Franklin of Duke University Eric Foner of Columbia University and William S. McFeely of the University of Georgia.

9,A white supremacist charged with improperly buying bubonic plague cultures by mail pleaded not guilty today.The defendant Larry Wayne Harris 43 of Lancaster entered the plea at his arraignment in Fairfield County Common Pleas Court. Mr. Harris who has said he belongs to white separatist groups said he had been developing antidotes for the plague because of the potential invasion of germ-carrying rats from Iraq.He had been indicted on charges of forgery and receiving stolen property after the authorities said he misrepresented himself when he obtained freeze-dried bubonic plague cultures from a Maryland laboratory.
9,To the Editor:Your film reviewer refers to a gang rape in "The Shawshank Redemption" as "homosexual rape" (Sept. 23). Prisoner rape is an outrage perpetrated by heterosexuals usually on heterosexual victims. To call it "homosexual" rape gratuitously insults homosexuals and misleads the public about a horrifying practice for more than 300000 men and boys a year. If reviewers need to warn viewers that the rape alluded to involves one gender only "male rape" or "prison rape" would be sufficient. STEPHEN DONALDSON President Stop Prisoner Rape New York Sept. 26 1994

8,Turner Broadcasting System Inc. signed a four-year $275 million contract with the National Basketball Association yesterday that nearly tripled the annual license fee that cable television now pays to professional basketball.In early November the N.B.A. also tripled the value of its broadcast-television arrangement when NBC agreed to pay $600 million for four years for television rights to league games.When the promotional services won from NBC are included the total N.B.A. television arrangement for the 1990-93 seasons is worth nearly $925 million. Under the league's agreement with the players 53 percent of the income from the sale of television rights must go to the players and the new deals will probably push the average salary past $1 million from the current $750000.Under the new agreement TNT will show 50 regular-season games and at least 25 playoff games. The regular-season games are usually shown on Tuesday and Friday evenings.

1,COLDWATER Mich. — One October night in 2004 Curtis Dawkins smoked crack dressed up for Halloween in a gangster costume and terrorized a household killing one man and taking another hostage in a rampage that drew 24 patrol officers and a six-member SWAT team. He is serving a life sentence without parole in Michigan.On Tuesday he will also be a published author when his debut story collection is released by Scribner a literary imprint at one of the country’s top publishing houses. The unlikely story of how Mr. Dawkins a recovering addict and confessed killer landed a major book deal is a strange inversion of the usual prison-writing trajectory:Mr. Dawkins began as writer earning a Master of Fine Arts degree before he committed his crime. And while his book “The Graybar Hotel” has received early praise from writers like Roddy Doyle and Atticus Lish its release has also raised uncomfortable questions for the publisher as it tries to win over booksellers and critics to rally behind a work by an unknown debut writer — who is also a convicted murderer.Most of the stories in “The Graybar Hotel” take place in jail or prison and are narrated in the first person often by an unnamed prisoner. In “573543” an inmate called Pepper Pie is given a dead man’s prison identification number and learns to become invisible and pass through walls eventually escaping. The story’s title comes from Mr. Dawkins’s real prison ID number.In “The Boy Who Dreamed Too Much” the narrator is quarantined and undergoes psychological evaluation before being assigned to one of Michigan’s prisons. The protagonist’s crime is never revealed but his guilt is palpable. The smell of burning tobacco “caused me to think of home and all the pain I’d caused” he reflects. “I thought of my children and freedom everything I’d taken and lost.”
0,Yes there was a surge of patriotism after the Sept. 11 attacks and yes American soldiers are now in Iraq. Ms. Marenoff explained her mission in less far-reaching terms. She said she had been hired to broaden the Intrepid's audience and message. ''We're about the humanity behind the hardware'' she said. ''There's a common thread of heroism running through the Intrepid -- the idea 'I can be a hero in everyday life.' Or if veterans come in and see they've been honored then we've succeeded on that level.''Ms. Marenoff is 38 two years younger than G.I. Joe. And he ''was totally in the forefront of the boys in my childhood'' she said. ''You remember G.I. Joes being strong figures that represent heroism very American pure in a way. Parents were proud to have their kids play with them.''And Hasbro is happy to have G.I. Joe be something of a historical figure. ''We don't pursue today's events in the brand'' Mr. DePriest said. ''There's no Iraqi Freedom G.I. Joe. Instead we choose to take a higher road and commemorate heroes in uniform without tying them to specific events.''One recent Joe -- a 12-inch figure -- is a Navy Seal in an orange vest. Another features Duke a sergeant on the G.I. Joe team or so says an identification card on the package. Duke is thoroughly modern -- so much so that he talks. When his stomach is pushed his mouth opens in an O-shape and recorded phrases like ''lock and load'' or ''get the others -- we're going in'' come out. But there is a disjointedness to Joe's speech patterns. He. Talks. Like. This. With. A. Noticeable. Pause. Between. Each. Word. No. Battlefield. Commander. Could. Survive. Giving. Orders. This. Slowly.Which is not what Mr. DePriest remembers from his boyhood. ''You could impart any sort of adventure on G.I. Joe'' Mr. DePriest said. ''What we loved was he was a real guy a real hero as opposed to a superhero or a robot. When you get three boys together thinking about adventures you could do with G.I. Joe the options were limitless. G.I. Joe was a great thing that really brought us together and fueled our imaginations.''What he imagined he said was not necessarily military action. ''We grew up in a time when the G.I. Joe on the shelves had shifted gears from the military to what was called the adventure team the fuzzy hair and the kung fu grip. One of the things that Hasbro advertised was there are 50 adventures of G.I. Joe and there are literally 50 sets of clothes you could get. We fell under the spell of this globe-trotting adventurer who was part environmentalist and part kung fu expert. We joined up on adventures that went all over our backyard.''

0,Cellphones are a boon to stagecraft. With only a small clutch of electronics pressed to the head characters can now convincingly perform monologues anywhere: in cars on the beach in the tub. ''Karen Sisco'' which has its premiere tonight exploits this device spinning drama chiefly from close-ups on the radiantly made-up face of Carla Gugino the show's star as she bathes paces and drives in Miami. And all the while talks into her flip-top mobile.Sisco begins the pilot with a bad hangover. She is an alcoholic United States marshal who can't remember a recent shootout that knocked her out and garishly wounded her chest. As she tries to remember the show joins its amnesia plot with a sleeping-with-the-enemy plot in a two-for-one evening of favorite action formulas.''Karen Sisco'' is driven by a soundtrack of cool jazz -- easy listening that may remind viewers of being on hold. But on hold for what? The show seems to promise disclosures and entanglements but by the end of the first episode nothing seems to have happened. An intricate romance simply evaporates and Sisco gives no clue about why it even got started.Still your call is important to ABC and it's worth standing by for the second episode of ''Karen Sisco'' which will be shown next Wednesday. A prisoner sees an unexpected chance to escape his handler and he flees. Sisco who could have apprehended him also accidentally lets him go. This time she is not morally remote or immune to change. Rather she seems to have lost her virtuosity as a marshal even before the show can establish it.

1,In the wake of the spectacular best-picture snafu at Sunday’s night Oscars the fallout has begun.The two PwC accountants involved in the envelope mix-up that saw the producers from “La La Land” accepting the best picture award before everyone realized it belonged to “Moonlight” will not be working at the Oscars again according to a spokeswoman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.One of the accountants Brian Cullinan a partner at PwC had handed Warren Beatty the incorrect envelope moments before the actor went onstage with Faye Dunaway to present the best picture Oscar. Martha L. Ruiz the other PwC accountant who worked the awards with Mr. Cullinan will also not be returning the academy said.Mr. Cullinan had mistakenly given Mr. Beatty a duplicate envelope for best actress which had just gone to Emma Stone for “La La Land.” After Mr. Beatty read that envelope’s contents he showed it in confusion to Ms. Dunaway who saw the words “La La Land” and triumphantly announced it the winner creating what has been widely described as the most outrageous mistake in modern Oscars history.After the accountants realized the error they scrambled onstage with the ceremony’s stage manager to retrieve the wrong envelope and open the right one revealing that “Moonlight” had pulled off an upset. In those chaotic moments fingers immediately pointed to Mr. Beatty as the culprit; on Tuesday he issued a statement deflecting questions and asking that Cheryl Boone Isaacs the academy president clarify what happened.

1,The committee will release new rankings every week until Dec. 4 when its final rankings will determine the pairings for the national semifinals. Those games — the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale Ariz. and the Peach Bowl in Atlanta — will be held Dec. 31. The winners will go to the national title game on Jan. 11 in Tampa Fla.The 12-member committee will also help determine the composition of the four other playoff-affiliated bowl games although conference commitments play a part; for instance the Rose Bowl will pit a Big Ten team against a Pac-12 team.The highest-ranked champion from the second-tier conferences collectively known as the Group of Five will play in the Cotton Bowl in Arlington Tex. on Jan. 2. At No. 23 Western Michigan (9-0) of the Mid-American Conference remained in line for that spot with a 52-20 win over Ball State on Tuesday; Boise State (7-1) of the Mountain West is one place back in the rankings.The Big 12 which placed no members in the playoff in 2014 and is the only major conference that does not stage a league championship game is in a deep hole. No. 17 Baylor (6-1) No. 18 Oklahoma State (6-2) and No. 20 West Virginia (6-1) have had weak out-of-conference schedules and Oklahoma has lost to Houston which was not included in the rankings and to No. 6 Ohio State.There is a good case to be made that if Alabama Clemson Michigan and Washington win the remainder of their games they will fill the four spots in the final bracket. Washington would be 13-0 while Texas A&M could at best finish 11-1. (The Aggies would be blocked from playing in the SEC championship game by Alabama which also plays in the conference’s West division.)Four 13-0 major conference champions would be unprecedented in the playoff era though and challenges remain. Alabama plays at No. 13 Louisiana State (6-2) this weekend and hosts No. 9 Auburn on Nov. 26. Texas A&M also has L.S.U. remaining on its slate.In a throwback the most eagerly awaited regular-season game remains Michigan’s trip to Ohio State on Nov. 26. The winner is likely to face another current top-10 team — Wisconsin or Nebraska — for the Big Ten title.

1,Now it’s empathy that’s the thing with feathers. Or that’s the perception of the impenetrably thick-skulled men who rule the workplace in Mara Nelson-Greenberg’s “Do You Feel Anger?” a fitful comedy with an ingenious premise which opened on Tuesday night at the Vineyard Theater under the direction of Margot Bordelon.“Empathy? Isn’t that a type of bird?” asks Jon (Greg Keller) a boss at a debt collection agency with what appears to be genuine cluelessness. Jon is speaking to the newly arrived Sofia (Tiffany Villarin) a counselor who has been brought in to teach his team the value of compassion.Just before posing that question Jon had been extolling his company’s new maternity leave policy: “We let women leave when they’re giving birth.” And no that’s not a joke either. What Jon and his male co-workers — the short-tempered Howie (Justin Long) and the self-described poet Jordan (Ugo Chukwu) — find genuinely funny turns out to be a lot more inane and a lot scarier.Ms. Nelson-Greenberg has had the inspired notion of translating everyday sexism into the ostensibly nonsensical language of absurdism as it was practiced by the likes of Eugene Ionesco the young Edward Albee and more recently Christopher Durang. In the testosterone-saturated world of “Do You Feel Anger?” words have been uprooted and mangled to the point that they now convey only the most atavistic impulses.
9,But judging by the tempered reaction today it seemed that even they would be reluctant to harshly repudiate a President who is 20 points ahead in the polls. Even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York an authority on welfare refrained from criticizing his party's standard bearer.''The President will take some heat on this'' said Geoffrey Garin a Democratic pollster. ''But the fact is half the Democrats voted for the bill when it left the Senate. Clinton's not isolated in the Democratic Party on this position.'' If that argument fails Mr. Garin said the President can always contend that his vetoes saved the country from a more extreme bill. ''Clinton can argue he made a bad situation much better'' he said.Or as Fred Greenstein a professor of politics at Princeton University said ''Clinton can say 'I held out until I got something which wouldn't be unkind to children.' He can use it to claim credit to being true to his centrist principles.''It is possible though not likely that many Democrats lamenting the turning back of the Great Society will be so disappointed in Mr. Clinton's stand on welfare that they will sit out the election.Still the bottom line is that liberals have no place to go. ''It's not ingenuous or a new strategy'' said Robert M. Teeter a pollster who headed Mr. Bush's campaign in 1992. ''The liberal base is not going to vote for Perot or Dole.''Mr. Clinton's move not only takes a traditional Republican issue from Mr. Dole but could help incumbents in Congress who have been hungry to pass some substantive measure that they can trumpet to voters who are sick of gridlock.The action is probably less a political plus to Mr. Clinton than a detriment to Mr. Dole. Campaigning in Nashville this afternoon there was frustration in Mr. Dole's voice as he told a business audience: ''There's not a dime's worth of difference between the bill he talked about today and the one he vetoed a few months back. The only difference is that it's 97 days before the election.''

7,Compared to a Government bureau the mills of the gods grind exceeding fast. In August 1973 the United States Senate ratified an international convention for the protection of endangered species of plants and animals. The Interior Department actively promoted the treaty and urged quick passage of a law for carrying out its provisions. !laving got everything it asked for the Department has in effect sat on its hands ever sinceThe convention included an appendix listing several hundred critically endangered animals. Some were aiready on this country's endangered list hut 175 were not—and they are not to this day. They include a rare subspecies of Alaskan bear the clouded leopard the Indian elephant the pronghorn antelope and the American crocodile.For its slow‐motion reaction to a critical situation the Department's Office of Endangered Species pleads lack of personnel and more fundamentally lack of money. But that explanation has only a limited validity.No extensive investigation is required to add to this country's protected list species already declared by the treaty signatories to be endangered or seriously threatened. The little funding that might be needed can be had if the Department—and the Administration as a whole—has a genuine will to secure it. It is far more likely that the trouble stems from that interminable disease of bureaucracy—red tape.

8,Among the 30 Jews on the stage was Ignatz Bubis a builder and prominent Jew. In the course of the evening's heated exchanges Mr. Cohn-Bendit and other speakers in the audience asserted that Mr. Bubis was Mr. Fassbinder's prototype for a character in the play called The Rich Jew.Mr. Bubis who survived the war in Poland was asked at one point if he did not fear that the anti-Fassbinder protest would deepen anti-Semitism in West Germany rather than check it. ''My parents left Germany in 1935'' said Mr. Bubis his hands firm on a length of the protest banner. ''If what you say came to pass I might have to emigrate too.''The Jews were challenged to explain how they could be certain that a play was anti-Semitic when it had never been performed. Mr. Ruhle insisted that his dramatization of the Fassbinder text had taken care to avoid an anti-Semitic slant. He said the character called The Rich Jew in the original text was given a name ''A'' in his version.Death Camp SurvivorAnother of the protesters Josef Choupack said: ''I was in Bergen-Belsen and I remember when Goebbels said that it was he who decided who was a Jew. And I say that we decide what is anti-Semitic.''From the first row Christian Raabe a Frankfurt lawyer rose and said that he was half-Jewish on his mother's side. ''I have read this play twice and carefully I think'' he said. ''And I have come to the conclusion that The Rich Jew is the only human figure in the play. I believe it is not correct for one group of the population to say that only their opinion is correct.''As protesters and members of the audience took the floor in a free-form debate President Reagan's visit to the Bitburg cemetery with Chancellor Helmut Kohl last May became an issue. Mr. Reagan was criticized for visiting the cemetery because some of the graves were of Waffen SS soldiers.''Here we want to start'' said Michel Friedman a 29-year-old Christian Democratic member of the Frankfurt legislature. ''We also demonstrated at Bitburg but we were not enough. We are only 30000 Jews in the country and we cannot do what 60 million Germans should do.''

But the usual scornful look from George - and all the fans were awed. They saw his face grow stern and cold they saw his muscles strain And they sensed that Billy Martin was destined to be fired - again.

0,IT'S not surprising that "Riding the Bus With My Sister" the 2003 autobiographical book by Rachel Simon that inspired tonight's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation is set in a city that is never named. If word got out about the town's terrific bus drivers the regulars would be standing in the aisles. And Ms. Simon's sister Beth the most fanatic of regulars would be among them. In her book Ms. Simon describes Beth (near right with Ms. Simon) as "a person with mental retardation." She now prefers "with a developmental or cognitive disability" she said although Beth likes "a person with special needs" -- one of them being the freedom to bus-hop around her city for most of the day. Like the book the film shown at 9 on CBS is about the year Ms. Simon decided to enter her sister's world on wheels but includes flashbacks to their childhood. During her time en route Ms. Simon discovered the kindness of strangers (there are 12 bus drivers in her book reduced to two composites in the movie) as well as the special abilities of the sister she had worried too much about for 38 years. "I've inadvertently become a national speaker for both the disability community and the public transit industry and I meet bus drivers all around the country" she said. "They're a type of person that is well represented by the people in the movie -- very giving people sensitive people people people." It was at the house of one of Beth's bus-driving buddies that Ms. Simon and her sister first watched the film which stars Andie MacDowell as a dewy-eyed Rachel and Rosie O'Donnell as a bouncy beat-you-to-the-bus-door Beth. "What Rosie got" Ms. Simon said "was exactly what she wanted to get: a character who is being portrayed not as a stereotype but as a full person -- someone who isn't going to be pushed around." Not even to the film's Los Angeles premiere. "Oh yeah she knows what she wants" Ms. Simon said of the real Beth. "She doesn't want to be on an airplane. And what's the fun of sitting in a movie theater with movie stars if you can sit on a bus with your favorite driver?" JODY ALESANDRO

9,To the Editor:John Russell's tribute to Tom Armstrong's tenure as director of the Whitney Museum of American Art is well founded [''Adding Up the Costs of Changes at the Top'' March 18] . Nevertheless he should not have been shocked by Mr. Armstrong's recent dismissal. It's an occupational hazard.A museum with contemporary focus - like the Whitney - whose trustees are committed largely to patronage of living artists cannot be expected to demonstrate policy based in tradition and stability. These contemporary patron-trustees tend to make decisions in a businessman's vacuum unlike the ''collecteur-amateurs'' of earlier times.A practical truth may be that a museum director's job security varies directly with the average age of the works collected or exhibited by the museum. Although disturbing news for contemporary-museum officers this equation should give comfort to those working at institutions solidly bound to the art of previous centuries.SHELDON PECKNewton Mass.

9,BURSTING a speculative bubble is easy for a central banker. Doing so without killing a lot of innocent bystanders is not. Alan Greenspan may have accomplished the task.The operative phrase is "a lot" and there are many people who would disagree with it. Certainly there were many speculators who suffered greatly as a result of the Federal Reserve's tightening of credit including some who did not know they were speculating. But the Fed managed to unwind huge speculation on interest rates with only minimal damage to the stock market and the economy.The bubble was to be sure in large part a creation of Mr. Greenspan. When the American banking system was reeling from the effect of bad loans in 1990 the Fed and its chairman helped to engineer a prolonged period of falling interest rates and -- perhaps more importantly -- a very steep yield curve. With short rates much lower than long rates banks could pay less for deposits and make a nice profit buying government bonds.As time went on more and more people began to play that game and to convince themselves they were geniuses because the money rolled in. The derivatives market made it easier to make those bets and easier to conceal from the unsophisticated just what was being done. Getting out of the way when Mr. Greenspan changed the rules in February required nimble footwork that few could manage and 1994 produced a line of humiliated speculators including Piper Jaffray's Worth Bruntjen and Orange County's Robert Citron.

0,When Honduras defeated the United States 2-1 today to win the regional Olympic qualifying tournament in soccer ecstatic fans held blue-and-white Honduran flags in two hands and waved them as a matador waves a cape. They serenaded the team with loud horns at Hersheypark Stadium while the players carried Coach Ramon Enrique Maradiaga on their shoulders for a victory lap.Ten days earlier when players temporarily boycotted the tournament over nonpayment of bonuses there had been a different reaction toward the team in Honduras.''They wanted to stone us'' Maradiaga said.Today's match played before 12129 fans was not particularly meaningful in terms of the Olympics as both teams had qualified Friday for the 2000 Games in Sydney Australia.Yet the conclusion represented a stunningly improbable resurrection for a Honduran team that arrived as a national shame the day the tournament began lost 3-0 to the United States and then recovered to win the North American Central American and Caribbean regional tournament defeating the heavily favored Americans and Mexicans in three days.

1,Still wherever Lopez goes he is never far from a disquisition on humanity’s merciless ways. Rising from his bed one night in the tropical heat of Isla Santa Cruz in the Galápagos he walks alone (a frequent habit that makes for some of the book’s best bits) to the beach and watches a group of brown pelicans asleep on the bay. The birds’ vulnerability — “oblivious just now to all that is hidden and potentially threatening in the lightless world we share” — leads his train of thought to Spanish conquistadores releasing vicious dogs on Indians and from there to the European bankers who underwrote the slave trade in West Africa and on to the present horrors of Boko Haram. It’s all ultimately in the service of pondering the roots of barbarism and how we ignore the barbarism unfolding in our own society at our peril.Image Clearcutting near Highway 30 in Oregon. Credit... Leah Nash for The New York Times[ Read our round-up of recent books about climate change. ]Strangely though these relentless reminders of egregious acts don’t diminish the appeal of seeing the world through Lopez’s eyes. His reverence for exploring every corner of the world even the sites of its most shameful histories is infectious. Rarely does Lopez decline an offer of adventure no matter how potentially grueling the trip might be. Traveling he writes “turns the mind toward a consideration of context and releases it from the dictatorship of absolute truths about humanity. It helps one understand that all people do not want to be on the same road.”Lopez’s journeys often start in ways that make you shake your head. (More than a few trips begin with a banal sentence like: “In the austral fall of 1987 I was traveling through Namibia with a few people.” You know as one does.) One night he reads a paper in the scientific journal Nature about the discovery of some 4.27-billion-year-old zircon crystals in remote Western Australia. He immediately emails the researchers about visiting the field site — because he just happens to be headed to Perth soon “en route from Zimbabwe to the Northern Territory.”The scientists initially ignore his request. But he persists and several years later he’s finally on his way to the Jack Hills. He flies from the United States to Sydney and then goes by train to Perth persuading the engineers to let him ride in the locomotive. One day crossing the vast Nullarbor Plain “the train suddenly ran into a wall of water” a drenching rainstorm. When the weather clears a double rainbow appears. And then a mob of kangaroos arrives over a hundred of them leaping across the plain. “The sight of it was so exhilarating the three of us in the cab nodded an affirmation to one another. Whatever was wild and lyrical in the timeless world we were in the middle of it now.”Lopez proceeds in a rented four-wheel drive to a sheep-ranching outpost where a geologist has arranged lodging 120 miles from the nearest town “on an unsigned dirt track.” When he arrives the rancher and his daughter have “a meat pie in the oven and he wanted to know whether I took milk with my tea.” One day as Lopez is heading out to the geology site the rancher offers him a rifle and asks if he’d mind shooting any wild goats he encounters. Lopez declines. But through evening chats on the veranda the two men form a bond; the rancher ultimately visits Lopez at home in Oregon. This knack for making friends in the most unlikely places resonates long after you turn the last page. “Are we not bound” he asks “to learn how to speak with each other?”Had we mastered that skill 30-odd years ago would we be where we find ourselves today grappling with violent xenophobia while forests incinerate oceans rise and acidify magnificent organisms everywhere fade away? Where will we be three decades on if we don’t take heed? There is still time though not as much as there once was to shape what’s coming.

1,TOKYO — Kim Jong-un North Korea’s leader said Tuesday that he was willing to have a second summit meeting with President Trump but he paired the offer with a threat that if international sanctions against his country were not lifted the North would “have no choice” but to return to nuclear confrontation.“I am willing to meet the United States president at any time for the betterment of our international community” Mr. Kim said in his New Year’s Day speech broadcast on North Korea’s state-run television. “However if the United States does not keep its promise in our international community and misinterprets our patience and intention and continues with the sanctions then we have no choice for the sake of our national interest and peace of the Korean Peninsula but to come up with new initiatives and new measures.”Wearing a suit and tie and sitting in an overstuffed leather armchair in a book-lined room Mr. Kim offered a largely motivational speech about the need to strengthen the North Korean economy. But he took the opportunity to reiterate a demand that South Korea cease all military drills with “other foreign sources.”“Those should be completely stopped” Mr. Kim said. “That is our stance.”There were sparse direct references in the speech to denuclearization. But Mr. Kim said the country would not be willing to take further steps toward removing its nuclear weapons unless the United States reciprocated.

9,Michael Winerip's article made me wonder how many relatives of Jews trapped in Germany or Austria in the late 1930's may have received similar pleas for help. My mother Martha Gomberg received one -- a cable from a distant cousin in danger in Vienna. My mother gathered our family's available funds ($600 I believe) and went from Cleveland to Cuba. Somehow she managed to meet with the president-dictator Fulgencio Batista give him the money and ask him to issue visas for her cousin's family: a mother father and 12-year-old son. I think she had never before been south of Ohio.Miraculously Batista kept his word. Our cousins arrived in Cuba on the last boat that was allowed to discharge refugees. The son was permitted to come to the United States almost immediately. He lived with us for a year until his parents were allowed to enter.After their narrow escape from the Nazis our cousins prospered in this country. One happy ending among so many tragic ones.Joanne NathansBaltimore
8,Coach Rick Pitino threw a challenge at the Knicks and they met it by defeating the Milwaukee Bucks 113-103 tonight in what Trent Tucker called ''our biggest victory of the season.''The dare came when the coach completed the afternoon shootaround by saying: ''This game is going to be a barometer of how badly you want to make the playoffs. No more speeches no more motivational talks; it's your ball game now.''In posting only their fifth road victory in 35 games the Knicks (31-40) moved a game behind the Philadelphia 76ers and two behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the battle for the Eastern Conference's final two playoff spots. The Knicks have 11 games remaining 6 on the road and 5 at home where they have won 17 of their last 19 games. Knicks Shoot 53 PercentThe Knicks played some of their best defense of the season; they shot almost 53 percent from the field 10 percent higher than they averaged in the previous four games against the Bucks; and they outrebounded Milwaukee 51-39.

This is the safer version.” He added that he likes the Clinique bronzing cream because it has no chemical odor and the color isn’t too dark.Tom Ford the designer film director and creator of a namesake fashion label said he created Tom Ford Men’s Bronzing Gel for his own use. “I use a bronzer every single day” he said “and I had been searching for something that was high quality and masculine at the same time.”

9,Even in a genre noted for youthful prodigies Samuel R. Delany stands out. His first novel was published in 1962 when he was 20 years old. The next three years saw the appearance of a wildly ambitious trilogy now known as "The Fall of the Towers"; before the end of the decade five more novels (among them "The Einstein Intersection" which won a Nebula Award) and some innovative short stories including the Nebula-winning "Aye and Gomorrah" had secured Mr. Delany's reputation as one of science fiction's most important writers.Although he has reined in the rhetorical excesses of his early years he has never ceased to experiment with form and content. His subjects have included love and sex in their many guises and the central role of language in the human comedy. He has written a stylistically and thematically challenging novel that reached a wide audience ("Dhalgren") autobiography so frank it verges on pornography and some of science fiction's most thoughtful criticism.His latest novel THEY FLY AT CIRON (Tor/ Tom Doherty $19.95) serves as a kind of retrospective for Mr. Delany. While the writing displays the spare beauty of his mature style the setting and characters derive from a short story he wrote in 1962 but failed to sell. Even as his career flourished he could not get this story out of his mind; a second version reworked in collaboration with his friend James Sallis appeared under a joint byline in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1971. Still unsatisfied Mr. Delany kept tinkering. The version he offers now contains none of Mr. Sallis's contributions. Instead it represents a fruitful collaboration between the mature Mr. Delany and his younger self of 30 years ago.A biting parable about the bloody roots of civilization "They Fly at Ciron" takes place on an unnamed world that except for a few disconcerting details could be Earth before the beginning of recorded history. For those who believe that small is beautiful and growth is optional Ciron itself might be utopia -- one of a chain of independent villages and hamlets each linked to its neighbors by occasional travelers and trade but basically self-sufficient. Then one day the forces of Myetra arrive. Myetra is an empire in embryo a technologically advanced state whose leaders believe they are bringing the boon of civilization to those who survive their conquests.
9,When RUTH GRUBER was in the Soviet Arctic as a foreign correspondent for The New York Herald Tribune in 1936 she interviewed a 104-year-old Yakut woman who berated her for not being married. The woman warned "Don't wait too long" Mrs. Gruber recalled the other day. "She brought out a birch-bark cradle which had its own irrigation system and in which she had carried her 20 children and insisted I take it" Ms. Gruber said. "She sounded just like my own mother and I wondered had I traveled 11000 miles to find another Jewish mother."Seventeen years later and married Ms. Gruber had a daughter Celia Michaels and two years later a son David Michaels; the cradle was used for both.Now Ms. Gruber has her bags ready to go to London as soon as she hears from her daughter a television producer and videotape editor who is due to give birth. And what will she take with her? "That birch-bark cradle of course."

9,Dennis Martinez gained his first victory at Yankee Stadium 11 days before Joe Torre got his first victory anywhere as a manager. Last night Torre made it 1000 as the Yankees edged the Seattle Mariners 3-2 and Martinez is still looking for No. 2 at Yankee Stadium.''It doesn't seem that long ago but it was 20 years'' Torre said of his first victory with the Mets. ''We beat Montreal at Shea Stadium. Craig Swan. It was the first game I managed.''Torre joined Bobby Cox and Tony La Russa as the only 1000-game winners among active managers primarily because David Wells pitched his best game with the Yankees. Wells admittedly growing weary of comparisons with Jimmy Key scattered seven hits walked none and struck out nine in seven and two-thirds innings. He was especially tough with runners on base.''All I've been hearing for the last stinking week is we want Key back and all that'' Wells said. ''People are going to say things. Let them say it and go on.''
0,Fred Wilpon is trying to buy Nelson Doubleday's 50 percent share of the Mets and the owners have spent months squabbling over the deal. But Wilpon insisted yesterday that the negotiations would have no impact on the way General Manager Steve Phillips constructs the team for next season and he hinted that he might authorize Phillips to exceed the budget to sign a top player.''We have a 100 percent track record there'' Wilpon said referring to the times Phillips has asked for special permission to make a move. ''We've said yes every time. Over four or five years there have been several times; more than two.''The Mets would prefer to keep their payroll around $95 million for next season but with trades for elite hitters failing to materialize Phillips may turn to Wilpon for authorization to pursue a top free agent.''Someone said to me 'You're not going to get any free agents' '' Wilpon said. ''I said 'That's not entirely what Steve said.' Steve said we will more likely be getting our significant changes through the trade route because of the nature of our team. But he didn't preclude us from the free-agent market.''

9,Pentagon aid to the Soviet Union would be separate from and in addition to other public and private American assistance currently under consideration including increased agricultural loan guarantees and direct food aid this winter. The total amount of proposed Pentagon aid has not been determined the officials said.When the idea was first suggested by Mr. Aspin in August after the unsuccessful hard-line coup in Moscow Defense Secretary Dick Cheney dismissed it as "foolish" and "a serious mistake" that could damage United States security.Under gentle prodding from the White House though Mr. Cheney is now ready to relent on the condition that the Pentagon has authority to make the necessary budget cuts and to decide how the money will be spent on the Soviets Administration officials said.The Soviet aid package is the brainchild of the two influential leaders of the Armed Services Committees Mr. Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. For the last several weeks the two men have worked with their staffs and quietly with key Administration officials to draft a proposal acceptable to Congress and the Pentagon.The lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on the plan which is included in the military budget bill that House and Senate negotiators are expected to complete in the next few days.The full House and Senate are expected to approve the compromise bill which then goes to President Bush. Administration officials said the plan would not violate last year's budget agreement because the Soviet aid would come out of the Pentagon's budget. No Pentagon money could be devoted to domestic programs this year without reopening the budget agreement a very unlikely possibility.Lawmakers have suggested that the Pentagon consider a number of steps to assist the Soviet Union including using Air Force planes to transport food and medical aid to the Soviet people this winter and to provide other help in distributing the aid.
8,The key to a trouble-free start-up of heating equipment is maintenance. This is work for the experts and homeowners who schedule annual checkups of their oil furnaces have the right idea. The service should include a check of burner nozzles contact points filters and automatic controls. Gas burners are easier to maintain; a homeowner can change filters annually though professional cleaning of the furnace and venting will eventually be needed.Persistent problems with a gas pilot light or spark igniter should be handled by a professional. Make certain your fuel provider has night and emergency numbers. Here are some steps to take if things go wrong with an oil furnace. PROBLEM: Furnace won't startWHAT TO DO: Turn up thermostat check on/off switch and fuses or circuit breakers. PROBLEM: Furnace shuts offWHAT TO DO: Check fuel level. If you have fuel press restart button. PROBLEM: Furnace won't restart
1,Our turnout modelThere’s a big question on top of the standard margin of error in a poll: Who is going to vote? It’s a particularly challenging question this year since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.Our poll under different turnout scenarios Who will vote? Est. turnout Our poll result The types of people who voted in 2014 258k Barr +3 People whose voting history suggests they will vote regardless of what they say 273k Even Our estimate 275k Even People who say they will vote adjusted for past levels of truthfulness 291k Barr +2 The types of people who voted in 2016 305k Barr +4 People who say they are almost certain to vote and no one else 333k Barr +12 Every active registered voter 485k Barr +9In these scenarios higher turnout tends to be better for Republicans.Just because one candidate leads in all of these different turnout scenarios doesn’t mean much by itself. They don’t represent the full range of possible turnout scenarios let alone the full range of possible election results.

Backing From AbroadMr. Alfi said there was also evidence of financial support and contacts between the suspects and four other Middle East countries. He would not identify the targets of the plot or the countries involved.
1,How We Got Here
8,As fire and smoke filled Grand Central Terminal Wednesday morning a major concern among fire officials was the potential for PCB contamination from burning electrical transformers.The Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Company 1 was called with the first alarm at 5:30 A.M. to monitor the situation and check for other chemical dangers.PCB's or polychlorinated biphenlys were used as coolants in electrical transformers before the Federal Government banned them in 1977. Many transformers in utility power circuits and electrified railway cars built before the ban however still contain the substance. At high temperatures it becomes a cancer-causing agent that can be spread by smoke and soot.Firefighters of the HazMat unit as the company is known were among the first to enter Wednesday's blaze which swept through 18 decrepit rail cars left in an underground storage yard.
9,The New York State Power Authority seeking major improvements at the nuclear plants it operates in Westchester County and on the shore of Lake Ontario said yesterday that it planned to hire a New Orleans company to manage the plants.Under a preliminary agreement power authority officials said the Entergy Corporation which has won the nuclear industry's praise for its management of five plants in the South would take over the Indian Point 3 plant in Buchanan and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba under a five-year contract.Officials said details of the management contract including how much Entergy would be paid and how many of the power authority's workers would be cut remained to be determined pending an analysis by Entergy of the operations at the two plants. The plan requires the approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.At a news conference senior executives of the power authority said the private management proposal untested anywhere else was necessary because of both the poor performance at Fitzpatrick and Indian Point 3 and the heightened demands expected with deregulation of the electrical utility industry.

0,But victory on Rugby Road came at a price. While recognizing the clear gain of a modest heroin bust many there say that the aggressive tactics used against Mr. Sierra -- and others -- have too often swept up innocent bystanders too often increased tensions in the neighborhood too often left them feeling as if police officers had no sense of proportion.The major sentiment on this two-block stretch of Rugby Road near Midwood expressed by two dozen people who were interviewed is that the New York Police Department has in some fundamental way misunderstood what they expect from law enforcement. They describe a police precinct that mindlessly imposes the mores of Mayberry on what is a classic rough-and-tumble Brooklyn neighborhood -- working class Democratic ethnically dazzling full of swaggering striving characters who are not greatly shocked by a little human vice.They describe officers swooping into the neighborhood like urban warriors watching residents from rooftops circling in unmarked cars and surveillance vans seemingly oblivious to the rhythms of the neighborhood: who just moved in who is home from college who has a bad temper. Residents say the police never seem to know. Yet at the same time sometimes comically every scarf is a gang color every neighborhood scuffle a prelude to gang warfare every neighborhood nickname a menacing gang moniker. ''Wear a little bit of gold they ask you questions'' said Royale Gibbs 21 who lives on Rugby Road.Almost every black or Hispanic teenager on the street has a story of being stopped and frisked One teenager asked how many times he had been stopped in the last year started counting with the fingers on one hand then moved on to his other hand then went back for round two on the first hand before giving up altogether because his friends were laughing so hard at his misfortune.They howl in laughter as they recite in perfect unison the phrase they hear all too often from police officers -- ''You fit the description'' -- and they tell stories of being ticketed for spitting for riding bicycles on the sidewalk.
7,LONDON Nov. 2 (Reuters)— Najeeb Halaby the president of Pan American World Airways suggested today that prospec tive buyers of the Concorde the British‐French supersonic airliner be given a chance to try the plane in passenger serv ice before deciding whether to buy it.In an interview in Tuesday's issue of. The Financial Times which appeared tonight Mr. Halaby said he thought a small group of the world's major air lines should be allowed to fly the Concorde before it went into quantity production.Mr. Halaby said this would make sure the aircraft was safe economically sound and socially acceptable. He stressed that his proposal was not a delaying tactic so that the American supersonic transport could catch up.
0,Jim Antonucci/Associated PressCBS announced Wednesday the cancellation of the longest-running scripted program in broadcasting history the soap opera “Guiding Light.”It has been on radio and then television for 72 years beginning on NBC radio in 1937 and moving to CBS television in 1952. The last broadcast is scheduled for Sept. 18.The move came after many years of steep ratings decline for the soap which was owned by Procter & Gamble and thus was a link to the earliest days of daytime serial dramas on radio. The dramas gained the name “soap operas” because of sponsorship by soap companies.CBS and the producers of “Guiding Light” — which was also a throwback in being shot on the East Coast in Manhattan and on some sets in New Jersey — had taken several steps in recent years to try to keep the franchise alive especially in switching the production to a digital format intended to reduce costs.That move last year to handheld digital cameras and permanent four-walled sets as opposed to the traditional three-walled sets built by soaps to accommodate bulky stationary cameras saved considerable money according to CBS executives.But not enough to save the series. This year the audience for “Guiding Light” declined to just 2.1 million viewers. Its pattern over recent years had been steadily downward from 3 million viewers five years ago.Audio from the original radio broadcasts of “Guiding Light” can be found here at Internet Archive.Video of recent episodes of the show can be found here at the CBS Web site.

0,By an unusually slim margin of 30 to 20 (with one member absent) the City Council voted on Monday night to call on the State Legislature to adopt congestion pricing for Manhattan south of 60th Street giving Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his ally the Council speaker Christine C. Quinn a major victory. As Diane Cardwell notes the fight now moves to Albany where the biggest obstacle for the plan may well by Sheldon Silver the State Assembly speaker. (See related blog post.)As The Daily News notes “It was one of the closest votes in recent memory for a Council that usually passes measures by wide margins but supporters hailed it as a sign of broad support.”The New York Post reports “Senate Republicans said they may take up the congestion pricing measure as soon as today but Mayor Bloomberg’s plan faces significant opposition in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.”Friend Testifies in Sean Bell Shooting CaseTrent Benefield who was in the back seat during the fatal shooting told the court he saw a man standing in front of the car pointing a pistol at Mr. Bell.

9,"The intent was to hurt someone in the building" said an assistant chief fire marshal Louis Garcia in a news conference outside the building yesterday. "Someone was out to get someone here."Chief Garcia said that his investigators had canvassed the building interviewing tenants hoping to discover the identity of the arsonist and the motive behind the blaze. He did not publicly identify any suspects late yesterday. The landlord the Green Door Realty Corporation offered a $5000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the offender and was not considered a suspect in the blaze.The tenants were able to return to their apartments yesterday. As they went back into the building with its shattered windows its beige walls now black with soot and its tile floors littered with plaster from crumbling ceilings they spoke with anger and frustration demanding that the arsonist be found arrested and jailed. Most were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who paid $500 to $600 a month for three-bedroom apartments in what they described as a poor and crime-ridden neighborhood and many worried that their plight would soon be forgotten or ignored."This is the ghetto and we're minorities but we work hard here and we're not garbage" sobbed Maria Cerda a 50-year-old office worker who said she knew the women and children injured in the fire. "These people whoever did this wherever they are they have to be punished. We want justice."The eight victims of the blaze five of whom were critically injured included Carmen Delgado 35 and her two daughters Gisnel Guzman 5 and Alondra Guzman 2 who lived on the sixth floor according to relatives and the Fire Department. Sometime before the fire Ms. Delgado had blocked the entrance to the fire escape with a wooden door firefighters said perhaps hoping to prevent burglars from breaking into the apartment. But it also blocked their only escape route.
0,Can rock 'n' roll save a city's economy? When Jerry Grafstein a Canadian senator was introduced as ''a senator from SARS'' at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe this year he decided it was time to repair the reputation of Toronto where there have been 42 SARS fatalities the most outside Asia. In the process perhaps something could be done about the multimillion-dollar losses of the city's tourism and hospitality industries.So he and Dennis Mills also a member of Parliament looked for ways to send a message to the world that Toronto was free of severe acute respiratory syndrome and ready for the tourist and convention dollar again.They decided there was only one answer: classic rock.They privately raised most of the $7.1 million that the concert promoter Michael Cohl said he needed for the show. (''Quite frankly'' Mr. Grafstein said ''there was no way international millionaire rock stars were going to get subsidized by the government.'') The event organized in just two months and unofficially dubbed SARSstock and SARSfest drew some 450000 people to Downsview Park on Wednesday to see the Rolling Stones Justin Timberlake AC/DC and others.If Woodstock was an antiestablishment event SARSstock celebrated a return to the established order with patriotic announcements maple-leaf-flag waving advertisements that Toronto was open for business again and a lineup loaded with local acts like Sam Roberts the Tea Party Blue Rodeo Rush and the Guess Who. Though the Flaming Lips a lovable Oklahoma psychedelic-rock act with animal-costumed dancers donned surgical masks onstage scarcely any SARS posters face masks or T-shirts could be seen in the audience.

7,PATERSON N.J. Jan. 1— When the Labor Department designated this city and sur irounding Bergen and Passaic Counties as an area of “sub stantial” unemployment this week it came as no surprise to Frank Kaster.Shifting from foot‐to‐foot waiting stolidly for the long line in which he was standing to inch its way up to the claims counter at the United States Employment Service office here Mr. Kaster explained how he had been out of work for “about nine or 10 weeks.”Though single he found it “rough” to live on an unem ployment insurance check of $69 a week and was puzzled as to why he had been laid off after eight years on the job at the Heller Candy Company.“I used to bring the stuff up on the elevator” he said “and I got laid off with a lot of other people. They never told us anything.”
1,Millions of Americans are missing out on a chance to avoid debilitating fractures from weakened bones researchers say because they are terrified of exceedingly rare side effects from drugs that can help them.Reports of the drugs’ causing jawbones to rot and thighbones to snap in two have shaken many osteoporosis patients so much that they say they would rather take their chances with the disease. Use of the most commonly prescribed osteoporosis drugs fell by 50 percent from 2008 to 2012 according to a recent paper and doctors say the trend is continuing.Last month three professional groups — the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the National Bone Health Alliance — put out an urgent call for doctors to be more aggressive in treating patients at high risk and for patients to be more aware of the need for treatment. It followed a flurry of recent articles in medical journals documenting and bemoaning patients’ abandonment of traditional osteoporosis drugs. But osteoporosis experts are afraid their efforts will do little to change minds.“Ninety percent of patients when you talk to them about starting one of these drugs won’t go on” said Dr. Paul D. Miller medical director of the Colorado Center for Bone Research a medical practice in Lakewood. “Ninety percent who are on the drugs want to come off. The fear factor is huge.”

Keep staring at that grid. Sooner or later it will pop out at you.If that’s not enough of a reminder we have a 2007 puzzle by Peter A. Collins that will help you count off the months as long as you don’t let the creature at 36 Across get you first.You don’t need to be reminded that it’s hot outside but there are other kinds of hot things. Try this 2010 puzzle by Paula Gamache and see if you can get them all.Finally you might be tempted at this point in the summer to just take the plunge into any body of water you see.

7,The campaign for Governor of New Jersey now in its last five weeks finally has produced some heat and in the process seems to have awakened the state's volatile electorate to the elements of high drama present in this contest:Governor Byrne a 721000‐vote winner four years ago who lost most of his luster early in his administration had to beat nine rivals to get the Democratic nomination last June. Now he is trying to overtake his Republican opponent State Senator Raymond H. Bateman who has a 7‐point lead according to the polls.There is a strong emotional issue the state income tax championed by Mr. Byrne and denounced by Mr. Bateman.Interest in the outcome extends to the White House since New Jersey and Virginia are the only states in the nation with governorship races this year and the results could be interpreted as the first referendum on the Carter Administration. President Carter recently campaigned in the state with Mr. Byrne and said he would be back before the election Nov. 8.Not only the tempo but the nature of the campaign has changed. The Governor the target for so long of harsh criticism over the income tax went on the attack two weeks ago when Mr. Bateman offered a program that he says would enable him to run the state for the next four years without the tax. Mr. Byrne ridiculed the plan and its author reminding audiences that Mr. Bateman had voted for an income tax in the past and generally succeeded in putting his opponent on the defensive. Political observers could only wonder however how all this was affecting the state's inscrutable so‐far passive electorate.

0,The TV trucks arrived at 5 a.m.I’m back at federal Bankruptcy Court in Lower Manhattan this time to cover the first day of General Motors‘ long-awaited first-day hearings. (You can also follow along on Twitter.) And to no one’s surprise I’m not the only one with that bright idea.When I first arrived a little after 11 it became readily apparent that the courthouse staff was well prepared for the blitz of observers who would arrive. The plaza in front of the Bankruptcy Court (in the same building as the National Museum of the American Indian) was neatly sectioned off by metal barriers cordoning off pits for the expected throngs of photographers and video camera crews.And a small cadre of police and security officers were on hand to enforce order though none seemed particularly tense.By 1 p.m. a half-dozen spectators had grabbed seats in Room 623. That actually isn’t the customary courtroom for Judge Robert E. Gerber who was assigned to handle the G.M. case but that of Chief Judge Burton Lifland. Judge Gerber happens to have the smallest courtroom of all the bankruptcy judges in Manhattan a chamber roughly half the size of Judge Lifland’s whose much more spacious courtroom holds just under 100 people.Within the hour however the benches in the room quickly accumulated occupants. Assorted items — file folders stamped with law firm names papers bearing the CNBC logo various coats and jackets — sat sentry for future occupants. So too did dozens of young adults too fresh-faced to be anything but seat-warmers of one kind or another.(For what it’s worth the overflow room where I’ve camped out during the Chrysler hearings is far from packed. About a dozen folks are gathered here pecking away at their laptops.)By 3:30 p.m. it was hard not to navigate through the hallways without running into clumps of dark-suited lawyers striding down the hallway toward Judge Lifland’s courtroom which had become standing room only. Younger associates were easy to spot: they were the ones wheeling along cartons of documents.The hearing on Monday promises to be rather mundane concerned with typical first-day motions like payments to critical vendors and other concerns needed to keep the lights at G.M. on. The action should heat up when more controversial motions like the proposed 363 sale get under way.— Michael J. de la MercedGo to Michael’s Live-Tweeting of the G.M. Hearings

0,For a set John Isner had reason to keep dreaming. He took the first set in his third-round match with the best player in the world. Then he woke up. Well actually Roger Federer woke up rallying to win 6-7 (4) 6-2 6-4 6-2.Isner the 6-foot-9 American had 18 aces and 49 winners in all. But Federer started to do a better job of returning Isner’s booming serve in the second set and the gap in their games became obvious. The Swiss jerked Isner around the court drawing unforced errors galore as Isner grew tired. (Isner had 42 unforced errors to Federer’s 11.)To Isner’s credit Federer looked relieved more than anything after the match. Up next for Federer is the Spaniard Feliciano Lopez who defeated the American Donald Young earlier in four tight sets.

9,IN the five years since Yugoslavia entered its spiral of ethnic barbarism outside diplomats have often laid much of the blame at the feet of two ambitious men: Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. Each built his own political fortune on a base of nationalist passions that he stirred up among his countrymen when Communism collapsed.Now suddenly it seems as if both could be quickly forced out of power -- Mr. Milosevic by widespread street protests and Mr. Tudjman by cancer. So the question naturally arises: Would that help in the quest for a Balkan peace?The answer is: Perhaps but probably not.The people who surround the two Presidents are indeed preparing for their departure. But it is far from certain that the virulent nationalism repression and rampant corruption that have come to characterize their rule in Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia (which comprises Serbia and Montenegro) will be lessened.One reason is that behind the two men stand groups of hard-line nationalists who do not flinch at the use of force have little tolerance for parliamentary niceties or a free press and will not be eager to share power given the privileges and wealth they have amassed.

9,The bulletin out of Beth Israel Medical Center yesterday morning was intriguingly incomplete. ''At least'' five sets of twins the notice read had been born there in the last 24 hours. The wording raised two possibilities: either doctors there had no idea exactly what was going on or a statistically improbable occurrence was becoming even more so.In fact set No. 6 was on its way by early afternoon when a small army of doctors nurses and public relations people greeted reporters with the vitals: more twins than had ever been born in so short a time at the hospital had blinked their wrinkled way into the world starting at 7:40 A.M. Thursday. Half were the result of fertility treatments. Four of the 12 parents were lawyers. One father was a mailman. (''So both he and his wife deliver -- hah hah hah!'' one of the public relations people said.)The numbers went on: by noon two of the women had delivered naturally two had delivered by Caesarean section and one had had what an obstetrician Dr. Janet Stein called ''the complete obstetrical experience'' -- a natural birth and a Caesarean birth.''And the last set'' Dr. Stein said ''we hope she'll push them out any moment now.''Most important everybody was fine and the babies were beautiful.

8,TO French cooks garnishes and decorations have always been important. They can take many forms from a simple sprig of parsley or watercress to an ice sculpture or a pastry that is molded into an architectural shape and baked.Recently I prepared a recipe given to me by a friend Noelle Morris. The dish was breasts of chicken sauteed with mushrooms and given a garnish of cooked artichoke bottoms filled with a puree of sweet red peppers. Although it can be made in an hour I don't think of it as a dish for a casual meal. It is quite festive and worth fixing for a special occasion. The basic dish is excellent and the artichoke garnish gives it a special style.The preparation entails sauteing boneless chicken breasts in butter until cooked through. They are served on a bed of noodles with a white wine and mushroom cream sauce. When the garnish is added the contrasts both in the colors - the green of the artichokes and the red puree of peppers - and in the flavors will make your guests sit up in admiration. Chicken Noelle (Chicken breasts with artichokes) 8 boneless skinless chicken breast halves Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 2 red sweet peppers about 3/4 pound 4 tablespoons butter 1/2 pound mushrooms thinly sliced about 3 cups 2 tablespoons chopped shallots 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 pound medium egg noodles 2 quarts boiling water 4 buttered artichoke bottoms (see recipe) 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.1. Sprinkle pieces of breast meat with salt and pepper and set aside.2. Cut away the core of each pepper. Cut peppers lengthwise into quarters; discard inner veins and seeds. Put pieces of pepper in a saucepan with water to cover and bring to a boil. Simmer about eight minutes. Drain. In a processor or electric blender blend the pepper to a fine puree. Pour puree into a small skillet and cook about five minutes. Add one tablespoon of butter.

0,''The state statute says you can substitute a name on the ballot within 51 days of the election'' Mr. Perr said. ''However the statute then stops and doesn't say what happens if you are closer than 51 days. So what it will come down to is a battle over the common law and practices of the state.''Mr. Perr said the courts were unlikely to insist on a blank space on a major party's ballot in a federal election. ''There is an overwhelming federal and state trend toward giving the voters as much choice as possible around election time'' he said.Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee said today ''The law in New Jersey is very clear: an individual may not pull his or her name from the ballot 51 days from the election.'' He said the committee would join ''in any challenge'' to the effort to replace Mr. Torricelli.William Barrone the lawyer for Douglas R. Forrester the Republican nominee whose campaign had repeatedly called for Mr. Torricelli to resign from the Senate said today that the only exception to the 51-day rule the courts had allowed was in the case of a candidate who died after the deadline had passed.''The Democrats will say 'Well Bob Torricelli dropped out and now the voters have a right to choose' '' Mr. Barrone said. ''Well the voters have that right but it's not like Bob Torricelli was hit by a bus -- he got hit by his own ethics.''Mr. Barrone said the mechanics of printing and distributing ballots made the change with 36 days to go unreasonable and illegal.''In this case not only have the deadlines been blown by more than two weeks'' he said ''the ballots have been printed in all 21 counties absentee ballots in some counties have been mailed and far more importantly -- our overseas military voters have a federal right to vote by absentee and their ballots were sent out last week.''

9,In the modern annals of political warfare no leader had been more effective than Yasir Arafat. He used its techniques and strategies to achieve major goals against an enemy far stronger militarily. But despite his successes once again his character and ambitions have led Palestinians to the brink of disaster.The Arafat techniques include an international propaganda campaign that made much of the world accept as truth the fiction that a part of Jerusalem is already a city in itself with an Arab majority belonging to Palestinians by history and right. Arab Jerusalem or East Jerusalem they call it.Any action by Israel to defend its interests and sovereignty in that fictitious city like opening a second door in an archeological tunnel or building apartments for Jews is denounced by Mr. Arafat and countries around the world as provocation and justification for Arab riots and terrorist murders.Terrorism is a built-in part of Mr. Arafat's political warfare. The technique is to promise to give it up as a weapon against the Jews. Collect for the promise. Then break it when necessary to put more pressure on Israel. Make the promise again. Collect.

8,BAKING with flour is not the microwave oven's best trick nor is browning. But when you want to do one or both of these things the microwave oven can be a great aid in preparation that would otherwise take more time or be more annoying. The filling for a lemon-orange meringue pie can be made in the microwave oven. The crust is conventionally baked and the meringue is once again browned under the broiler. The lemon curd is easy to make in a microwave oven and does not scorch. It also contains no gelatin. It can be made ahead of time and left to chill overnight. The crust can also be baked ahead of time. For a nice variation add orange sections and orange zest. Lemon-Orange Meringue Pie Preparation time: 30 minutes plus time for making lemon curd and chilling crust Cooking time: 25 minutes 2 cups lemon curd (see recipe) 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3 ounces cold lard 3 ounces chilled unsalted butter cut into small pieces 3 tablespoons cold water 1/4 cup orange marmalade 2 juice oranges optional 4 egg whites pinch cream of tartar pinch kosher salt 1/4 cup granulated sugar.1.Make lemon curd and place in the refrigerator to chill while finishing recipe.2.To make the crust sift together flour and salt in the large bowl of an electric mixer. Add lard and butter and mix with a paddle until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cold water and mix only until dough forms a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for one hour.3.Roll out pastry or press it into a 9-inch glass pie plate. Prick bottom all over with a fork. Line with baking parchment or aluminum foil and weight with beans or pie weights. Chill for 15 minutes.4.Preheat conventional oven to 425 degrees.5.Place crust in oven and bake for 10 minutes or until edges are set. Remove beans and parchment and continue baking for 10 more minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven.

1,EHRLICH--Peter R. A memorial service will be held on Saturday June 7th at 11:00am at St. Matthews Church Bedford NY.
1,VideoBernie Sanders said on Sunday that he and Hillary Clinton were heading to a “contested” convention this summer because she will need superdelegates to secure the nomination a claim that clashes with the accepted definition of a contested convention. He also said that superdelegates who have supported her should switch to him instead.At a news conference in Washington Mr. Sanders said that the Democratic convention in July would be contested because “it is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14 with pledged delegates alone” and that she “will need superdelegates to take her over the top.” He added: “In other words the convention will be a contested convention.”A convention is typically understood as contested when a candidate cannot reach the necessary delegate count using both pledged delegates and superdelegates typically party officials and state leaders who are not bound to any candidate.Mr. Sanders urged superdelegates in states that he has won and those who came out in support of Mrs. Clinton before he declared his candidacy to switch their support to him. He also said other superdelegates should consider supporting him because in many polls he beats Donald J. Trump by more than points Mrs. Clinton does and that they would be more likely to do so if he won further primaries.He acknowledged that his strategy to persuade the superdelegates to switch would be difficult.“We have an uphill climb no questions about it” he said. “It is not going to be easy. Nothing I’m telling you today suggests that this is going to be an easy fight.”Mr. Sanders’s push for superdelegates comes as he fights to remain viable after a string of losses last week and a sharp drop in fundraising in April. Mr. Sanders has the support of 39 superdelegates while 520 have said they will support Mrs. Clinton. She also leads him in pledged delegates 1663 to 1367 giving her a total lead of 2183 to 1406. It takes 2383 total delegates to secure the nomination.Mr. Sanders expressed frustration that Mrs. Clinton had won superdelegates even in states where he won the primary. In Washington State where he won almost 73 percent of the vote Mrs. Clinton has 10 superdelegates while he has none. In Colorado Mr. Sanders won 59 percent of the vote but again Mrs. Clinton has 10 superdelegates from that state and he has none. Sanders aides handed out a list showing similar situations in states like New Hampshire Kansas and Maine where he won more votes but has fewer superdelegates than his rival.“If I win a state with 70 percent of the vote you know what? I think I am entitled to those superdelegates” Mr. Sanders said. “I think the superdelegates should reflect what the people of the state want and that’s true for Hillary Clinton as well.”According to Democratic Party rules pledged delegates must follow the wishes of voters while superdelegates can support whichever candidate they want. In 2008 Barack Obama won the party’s nomination against Mrs. Clinton using pledged and superdelegates.Still Mr. Sanders was adamant about his strategy. He called Mrs. Clinton the party’s “second strongest candidate” and said he hoped superdelegates would focus on his strength among independents and young people.“I think the real struggle will be in the hearts and the minds of superdelegates who came onboard the Clinton campaign a long long time ago” Mr. Sanders said. “That is admittedly a tough road to climb but it is not an impossible road to climb and we intend to fight for every vote in front of us and for every delegate remaining.”

0,In a program note for his Carnegie Hall recital on Thursday evening the pianist Andras Schiff wrote that he thinks "in terms of projects and not just single concerts." That seems to have been his approach all along: 25 years ago he seemed focused on Bach and concentrations on Mozart Bartok and Schubert followed.Lately he has been interested in Janacek although not for the first time. He recorded the composer's music for Decca in the early 1990's and for ECM more recently. In the last couple of weeks he played in two Janacek-centered chamber concerts at Zankel Hall (although in one his own performance was in a Dvorak work) and at his recital he offered Janacek's three most substantial piano works "On the Overgrown Path" (Series I) the Sonata "1.X.1905" and "In the Mists."Mr. Schiff finds a universe in these three scores. The tuneful folk-tinged portraits embody both recollections of the rural Moravia of Janacek's youth and sorrow over the death of the composer's daughter in 1903. Those may not seem to be extremes. Nostalgia after all often has a melancholy tinge. Mr. Schiff navigated these currents deftly and his success at keeping the distinctions clear paid off in his poignant reading of the final vignette "The Barn Owl Has Flown Away" where nostalgia and grief intermingle.The sonata which commemorates a riot in Brno in which a student demonstrator was killed and "In the Mists" an introspective often brooding work are denser more sharp-edged scores. Mr. Schiff's accounts of both thrived on clarity of texture and a fine balance of the dramatic and the emotional and in the Sonata especially his fluid tempos put the music's passions in high relief.

0,WASHINGTON May 31 - When he becomes president of the World Bank on Wednesday Paul D. Wolfowitz says Africa will be his top priority."Nothing would be more satisfying than to feel at the end of however long a term I serve here that we played a role in changing Africa from a continent of despair to a continent of hope" he said Tuesday at his first news conference.To underline that commitment he will travel to Africa in June.Mr. Wolfowitz becomes the 10th president of the bank the world's largest development organization at a time when experts are again asking basic questions about what works in pulling countries out of poverty.One of the few things most development institutions agree on is the need for a large increase in development aid. The United Nations and the World Bank under James D. Wolfensohn the departing president have called for the world's rich nations to double the aid given to the poor.
0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students investigate artificially elevated regions or cities around the world to compare histories cultures and strategies related to potential flooding disaster.Author(s):Annissa Hambouz The New York Times Learning NetworkJavaid Khan The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – one hourObjectives:Students will:1. Speculate about their vulnerability to a natural disaster; speculate about their potential reactions to an impending natural disaster.2. Examine New Orleans’s risk of flood disaster by reading and discussing the article “Nothing’s Easy for New Orleans Flood Control.”3. Compare the New Orleans’s case to other cities or regions around the world vulnerable to the threat of floods through in-class research.4. Create three-dimensional models of the flood-prone regions.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils-paper-student journals-classroom blackboard-copies of “Nothing’s Easy for New Orleans Flood Control” (one per student)-geography resources (textbooks encyclopedias computers with Internet access)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “To what types of natural disasters do you think your town or region might be vulnerable? If you were given a few days’ warning of an impending natural disaster how do you think you might prepare? How would you react if meteorological predictions regarding the impending disaster were unclear and some people dismissed the warnings as ‘exaggerations’?” Allow students to share responses briefly.2. As a class read and discuss the article “Nothing’s Easy for New Orleans Flood Control” focusing on the following questions:a. Between which bodies of water does New Orleans lie?b. What might happen if a hurricane from the Gulf of Mexico reached New Orleans?c. What measures has the city taken to prevent such a disaster from occurring?d. Who is Dr. Suhayda?e. What types of hypothetical flooding situations are scientists researching?f. What are some proposed methods of preventing future catastrophes?g. What is the “community haven” concept?h. What makes the city of New Orleans particularly vulnerable to experiencing a natural disaster?i. How has the city’s development added to its vulnerability?j. What does the reporter liken to “spider webs” and a “witches’ brew”?k. Who is Dr. van Heerden?l. According to Dr. van Heerden what would New Orleans’s “worst case situation” be?m. How much might that worst case scenario cost the city?n. When is hurricane season?o. What are the chances of a disastrous hurricane striking the city?p. How does the American Red Cross treat the threat of disaster in New Orleans?3. Divide students into groups and assign each a flood-prone geographical location to research. Choose regions or cities you have studied. Suggestions include: New Orleans the Netherlands (Zeeland and Ijselmeer) Bangladesh and Thailand (Bangkok). Using all available resources each group conducts basic research about their assigned region summarizing the following aspects of the area (written on the board for easier student access):–Body of water or meteorological challenge to the region–History of city’s or region’s development–Cultural aspects connected to the flood-prone nature of the region (Dutch “man vs. water” literature colloquial expressions etc.)–Transportation–Past solutions in times of flooding–Current solutions in times of flooding–Future plans to prevent further destruction from flooding–Current and projected costs of flood controlGroups should write a “fact sheet” for their region or city based on their research.4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK Each student creates a three-dimensional topographical representation of their city or region to accompany the group’s fact sheet completed in class. In a future class each group can present an assessment of their region’s level of preparation in the event of a flood. Different scenarios can be illustrated by using the graphic representations of the regions that were created for the homework assignment.Further Questions for Discussion:–Do you think it is worth it for the city of New Orleans to spend millions of dollars preparing for a disaster that might never occur?–Do you think New Orleans will have difficulty maintaining its status as a residential and tourist destination once its status as “disaster prone” gains more public attention? Why or why not?–Would you consider moving to a disaster-vulnerable region or city? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal responses thoughtful participation in class discussions group research and presentation of three-dimensional maps.Vocabulary:levees surge propelled prohibitive geological meteorological sultry hypothetical evacuation blunt marshlands sediment eroded barrier delta dredged containership crucial peril pimento metaphoric petrochemical morass incalculable cataclysmicExtension Activities:1. Choose two or three sites of past natural disasters where residents were warned of potential danger in advance. Write an investigative report about how people prepared or did not prepare for the disaster.2. New Orleans is known for its famous “Mardi Gras” celebrations. Research the history behind the “Shrove Tuesday” holiday and compare the festivities in New Orleans to “Fasching” in Switzerland and “Carnival” in Brazil. Create a collage that combines images from each of these celebrations.3. How were the early river valley civilizations affected by floods? Compare Indus Nile Yellow Tigris and Euphrates civilizations. How did floods affect these cultures and belief systems? Present your findings in an illustrated chart.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research New Orleans history. How did the city develop? Who were its original inhabitants? What role did it play in the development of colonial America? Make a timeline of key events.Economics- Choose three recent natural disasters and three examples of human-made catastrophes (acts of war or terrorism etc.). Compare the estimated damages of each event then plot and graph these figures along with the amount of aid or assistance received in the aftermath of the disasters.Language Arts- Design a disaster response brochure for children in the event of a dangerous flood. Explain how to prepare for a flood and illustrate your steps with drawings.Science- This article mentions potential water contamination as a result of floods. How is water tested? Make a “How it Works” chart explaining the process by which water is tested for chemical composition and contamination.Other Information on the Web:New Orleans District (//www.mvn.usace.army.mil/) designs constructs and operates navigation flood control hurricane protection environmental and water resource development projects in southern Louisiana.FEMA Storm Watch (//www.fema.gov/fema/trop.htm) provides information on tropical storms from the Federal Emergency Management Agency including disaster news and flood warnings.InFocus: Floods (//www.pbs.org/newshour/infocus/floods.html) teaches about how and why floods happen offers real-life accounts of what happened during different floods and much more.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Geography Standard 4- Understands the physical and human characteristics of place.

7,Ralph Nader asserted yester day that the United States would “become a nation of slaves” unless safeguards and human values were integrated “before it's too late” into what he called the unregulated and uncontrolled use of computers.In a wine‐ranging speech at the New York Hilton before the 25th annual convention of the 27000‐member Association of Computing Machinery Mr. Nader described in pessimistic terms the ramifications of a growing computer technology that he said is now “exclu sively in the domain of cor porate and governmental con trol.”Because “the computer and the consumer should be the major concern of somebody in society” the consumer crusader urged his audience to begin to infuse “human considerations and values” into the use of com puters.Mr. Nader predicted that a “citizen backlash” against com puters was inevitable if their use remained completely apart from public review.
6,SAIGON South Vietnam Dec. 31—Buddhist leaders met today in a national convention whose purpose was to unify the Vietnamese Buddhists and to thresh out their political course.Although the speakers' references to politics were veiled young Buddhist monks who gained their first taste of political action in demonstrations against the late President Ngo Dinh Diem earlier this year made plain they intended to weld Buddhism into a powerful and permanent political force.“The experiences of recent months have shown us that social events can deeply influence religious life because Buddhists are at the same time citizens of the country” declared Thich Tam Chau chairman of the intersect committee which led the religious and political movement that helped overthrow the Diem regime.Another speaker Thich Thien Minh called for a systematic organization of Buddhism. “Out of experience the Buddhists must be realistic” he said. “They should not consider religion as a vague doctrine but as a real organization.”

6,CHICAGO June 30 — Gov‐ ernor William W. Scranton said today that the Republican voters of Illinois supported his candidacy for the Presidential nomination even if their convention delegates did not. He expected he said that some of the delegates would recog‐nize that fact by convention time. July 13.The Pennsylvania Governor at a news conference said that the Nielson Poll an established organization had found that 65 per cent of the Illinois Republicans favored him and that 35 per cent supported Sentor Barry Goldwater.Mr. Scranton's news conference took place before the Illinois delegation announced that 48 of its 58 members had committed themselves to Mr. Goldwater with none for Mr. Scranton.The Governor however had been prepared for the blow. He was asked whether he would be surprised or shocked if the delegation indicated 48 or more for his rival.

0,ZAGREB Croatia March 31 - The Bosnian Serb authorities said Thursday that they were investigating nearly 900 officials of their own government to determine whether they had a role in the killings of more than 7000 Muslim men and boys from the town of Srebrenica in 1995 during the war in Bosnia.A commission of inquiry has given Bosnian state prosecutors the names of 892 people accused of some responsibility in the killings considered the worst mass killing in Europe since the end of World War II.The list was drawn up at the request of Lord Ashdown the British envoy who is the international administrator in Bosnia after a report on the killings published by the Bosnian Serb government in December.Until last year the Bosnian Serb authorities had denied the extent of the killings which were committed by Bosnian Serb security forces in a final push to create an exclusively Serbian state within Bosnia.

1,PhotoAdministrivial Notepad-in-the-Tuesday-Puzzle Alert! If you solve the crossword using Across Lite the iOS app or the Windows app please take the time to read the Notepad in the Tuesday puzzle. I can’t tell you what it says because it would spoil the puzzle but trust the emus: you’ll have a much better experience if you read it.MONDAY PUZZLE — Well. Here we are with a hilarious and well-developed puzzle by Loren Muse Smith and Andrea “I Rock Mondays” Michaels. Now I just have to blog this in a way that won’t get me fired. [What? — Ed.] [Nothing. — D.A.]It’s definitely a refreshing theme by our standards and this makes a pair of New York Times puzzles by Loren Muse Smith. There are three types of bras hinted at by the starts of the theme entries and the revealer at 58 Across gives the entire puzzle an energetic boost. Interestingly the last time BOOBY TRAPS was seen in The New York Times crossword was in 1968 and it’s high time it was brought back so kudos Ms. Smith Ms. Michaels and Will Shortz.What I really liked was the smoothness of the solve and you could definitely feel Ms. Michaels’s touch here. I don’t think I hit any speedbumps here at all. My favorite entries were PADDED CELL PUSH UP DAISIES MIRACLE WORKER ODDS MAKER and SPORK.Let’s chat with our constructors:Constructors’ Notes:Loren Muse Smith: A couple of years ago Andrea emailed me telling me I should consider trying to construct. We started working on various ideas – man she’s a bundle of energy and enthusiasm! And patience. It occurred to me that I could take some wordplay I’d been joking around with for years before constructing and translate them into themes. I’ve been maintaining for years that BOOBY TRAPS would be a fun name for a bra store. So then I thought it’d be a cool revealer. My thought on its execution was utterly pedestrian; Andrea is the one who suggested going the disguise-the-bra-type-in-another-phrase idea. We racked our brains coming up with kinds of bras – training halter Wonder support plunge – until we settled on this group. It’s cheeky but I hope solvers will be good sports as Will continues to allow the Grey Lady to well to bust out of her more traditional confines of propriety and decorum. Andrea Carla Michaels: I was impressed with Loren’s unbridled enthusiasm and hysterical anecdotes on “another” blog and thought she’d make a fantastic constructrix if given a bit of a nudge. This took 3-/2 years to “develop”! It was quickly accepted 3 years ago but sat on for who knows why! By the time it was ready to publish we were told the fill would no longer fly. We had five entries some starting with the bra type some ending so in order to get a cleaner fill we decided four would be the new five and we would start all the theme phrases with types of bras … Loren created a nice new grid with CHEST in the middle. But in the end CLINT gave us the cleanest fill. We are thrilled that it’s finally seeing the light of day … and yes we would like a medal AND a chest to pin it on!O.K. then. Let’s change the subject:Your thoughts?
1,STUART Fla. — A rancid smell penetrated the front of Marisa and Duncan Baskin’s one-story house which rests less than 100 feet from an inlet of the St. Lucie River in this tourist hamlet just inside the Atlantic coastline that bills itself as “America’s Happiest Seaside Town.”But the Baskins — whose 22-month-old daughter like Ms. Baskin suffers from asthma — and their neighbors are not so happy these days. In the water of the inlet of their subdivision in Northriver Shores an inch-thick layer of bubbling ooze and slime emits a stench so overwhelming that none of the neighbors go outside.In fact the Baskins were preparing Friday to stay with friends across town for the weekend just to get away from the green and blue algae bloom that has overtaken their small neighborhood marina from which most neighbors have moved their boats.“Our lives revolve around the water; we have a boat surfboards and there’s nothing really to do here without the water” Ms. Baskin 31 a lifelong resident of Stuart who works as a social worker at a local hospital said Friday. “And I think our governor and local politicians are to blame. This isn’t the first time this has happened but it’s definitely the worst.”

1,PERRYSBURG Ohio — Bill Clinton swept through a campaign visit to Ohio on behalf of President Obama on Thursday blasting Mitt Romney and his surrogates for implying that Jeep might begin manufacturing vehicles in China at the expense of American jobs and for suggesting that Colin L. Powell endorsed Mr. Obama because both men are black.Mr. Clinton 66 started the day with a campaign stop in Wisconsin and made his first Ohio stop here outside Toledo his voice as hoarse as it often was 20 years ago when he campaigned for president. Much of his appearance was a reprise of his speech at the Democratic National Convention and other campaign talks that have praised Mr. Obama’s economic health care and student loan policies.“My voice is a little weak” he told a crowd of about 1900 students and other supporters at Owens Community College. “But I wasted it in a good cause.”In fact the pace of his appearances for Mr. Obama was evident a few minutes into his speech when Mr. Clinton said “I’m honored to be here in Pennsylvania to support President Obama.”“Ohio!” many in the crowd shouted.“I have a Pennsylvania line in the speech” Mr. Clinton explained. But it was a forgiving crowd. “It’s O.K” one woman screamed. “Give ’em hell Bill” a man shouted a few minutes later.Mr. Clinton reveled in the opportunity to attack Mr. Romney over the Republican ticket’s widely criticized commercial that left the misleading impression that Chrysler — the corporate parent of Jeep – would build Jeeps in China at the expense of American jobs. The automaker says it is discussing new Jeep production in China for sales within China but that would not affect jobs in the United States and that it is adding workers in Toledo. The Romney campaign has stood by the accuracy of the commercial.“Mr. Romney has come into Ohio time and time again and tied himself in knots” Mr. Clinton said. “So what’s their latest scam? You’ve probably seen it — they say that Jeep is moving jobs to China.” Many in the crowd also shouted “China!” as Mr. Clinton said it almost drowning his raspy voice.“The truest thing the Romney campaign ever said was they have no intention of having their campaign be dictated by fact-checkers” Mr. Clinton added.Mr. Clinton also took a shot at John H. Sununu the former New Hampshire governor and one of Mr. Romney’s chief surrogates who last week had suggested that Mr. Powell the former secretary of state under George W. Bush may have endorsed Mr. Obama for a second time because they are both of the same race.“Oh he endorsed him because they are both black” Mr. Clinton said using his own paraphrase of Mr. Sununu’s comments. (Mr. Sununu had quickly backtracked last week saying he did not doubt Mr. Powell’s endorsement was based on anything other than support for Mr. Obama’s policies.)And Mr. Clinton wasn’t finished. He mentioned how the Romney campaign had in Mr. Clinton’s words stated that “now the Italians are taking your jobs away.” (Chrysler is majority-owned by Fiat – the “Italians” – and the Romney commercial’s voiceover had stated that Mr. Obama had “sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job.” Text shown on the screen had also said “Plans to return Jeep output to China.”)Chrysler’s chief executive Sergio Marchionne e-mailed his employees earlier this week to “unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China” adding that “it is inaccurate to suggest anything different.”Mr. Clinton who says he has Irish ancestry closed his remarks here by joking “Pretty soon they’ll come after the Irish – and I’m toast.”
0,Tennessee may need to buy a 30-minute ad in prime time to introduce itself to the country as the N.F.L.’s best team. After pulling away for a convincing win over the Colts on Monday the Titans (7-0) have a two-game lead in the A.F.C. and a four-game lead in their division. But they are on a short week as the Packers (4-3) coming off a bye have had two weeks to heal and prepare. Throw in the fact that these two teams last played four years ago and this game is dangerous for Tennessee.The Titans’ hallmark has been their defensive line and run stoppers led by Albert Haynesworth and Kyle Vanden Bosch but their pass defense is not a pushover; it is ranked fourth in the N.F.L. and is leading the A.F.C. with 12 interceptions. It does not give up big plays it is tied for the league lead at 5.7 yards a pass. That might take Green Bay’s deep threats out of the game.But Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers is actually playing better since injuring his shoulder. Playing hurt for his past three games he has completed 71 percent of his passes with 6 touchdown passes an interception and a 108.5 passer rating.Line: Titans by 4 1/2PATRIOTS (5-2) at COLTS (3-4)Colts by 6Perhaps the prime example of this season’s reshuffling of the deck is the state of the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts heading into their game Sunday night. For the past few years this game has been a highlight of the regular-season schedule. But these rivals may have trouble recognizing each other this year. The Patriots’ offense after all is led by Matt Cassel and Kevin Faulk. And this is the first time since October 2001 that one of the teams has had a losing record when they played.The Colts need a win especially with a game in Pittsburgh next week. They could look like a different team because of the expected returns of safety Bob Sanders and running back Joseph Addai. Sanders’s absence has been cited often for the struggles of the Colts’ defense but Sanders is not a one-man miracle machine. And just the Colts’ luck: as soon as they got Sanders back they lost starting cornerback Marlin Jackson for the season because of an injured right knee.The Patriots are also having trouble finding healthy defensive backs not an ideal situation when facing the Colts. New England whose previous opponents are 19-32 is in the meat of its schedule. This game is followed by three American Football Conference East games then a matchup with the Steelers.Patriots-Colts may not be as glamorous as in years past but it could still be a turning point for both teams.COWBOYS (5-3) at GIANTS (6-1)Giants by 9Brad Johnson is undefeated at Giants Stadium with a 3-0 record and a 113.1 passer rating. But the last time he started there was November 2005 a 24-21 victory with the Vikings. Johnson’s passer rating in his two starts with Dallas is 60.3 and he may be on a short leash with Brooks Bollinger receiving snaps with the first-team offense in practice last week.JETS (4-3) at BILLS (5-2)Bills by 5 1/2Trent Edwards and Brett Favre have a few things in common. They each have a penchant for fourth-quarter rallies and they each turned the ball over three times last week. A game between such evenly matched teams could come down to turnovers. Buffalo has eight in its losses; the Jets have eight in theirs.CARDINALS (4-3) at RAMS (2-5)Cardinals by 3It will be like 1999 in St. Louis as the Rams induct Dick Vermeil into their Ring of Honor and Kurt Warner returns as Arizona’s starting quarterback. This will be his first start there against his former team. Believe it or not this game has playoff implications. The Rams so woeful mere weeks ago will be only one game out in the National Football Conference West if they win.TEXANS (3-4) at VIKINGS (3-4)Vikings by 4 1/2October has been a nonstop performance of the Matt Schaub-Andre Johnson show. What will November hold? Johnson has four consecutive games with more than 130 receiving yards and Houston has won three in a row for the first time. But remember September? That was the last time the Texans played on the road where they are 0-3.RAVENS (4-3) at BROWNS (3-4)Browns by 1 1/2Both offenses seem to be rounding into shape just in time for a key A.F.C. North game. With Joe Flacco more comfortable Baltimore last week unveiled a two-quarterback package featuring Troy Smith. Cleveland has been doing fine without Kellen Winslow but with him back Derek Anderson has all options available against the Ravens’ patchwork secondary.EAGLES (4-3) at SEAHAWKS (2-5)Eagles by 6 1/2Hey Seneca Wallace run! Wallace’s mobility is the reason Mike Holmgren occasionally uses him at receiver and Wallace is going to need that fancy footwork against Jim Johnson’s defense. There may be no escape for Seattle’s pass defense against the Eagles’ potent attack especially with defensive end Patrick Kerney out with a shoulder injury.STEELERS (5-2) at REDSKINS (6-2)Redskins by 2Clinton Portis’s five-game streak of 120-yard rushing games will be put to the test by the Steelers’ third-ranked run defense. Pittsburgh’s two losses are to N.F.C. East teams.DOLPHINS (3-4) at BRONCOS (4-3)Broncos by 3 1/2Denver spent its bye week trying to learn from a 41-7 loss to the Patriots. But Ronnie Brown should have a field day against the Broncos’ porous defense which is without the Bailey brothers.LIONS (0-7) at BEARS (4-3)Bears by 12 1/2In a Week 5 rout of Detroit Kyle Orton had his best game. Chicago will have its starting cornerbacks back which should neutralize the Lions’ one weapon Calvin Johnson.JAGUARS (3-4) at BENGALS (0-8)Jaguars by 7 1/2The Lions appear to be moving closer to a win but the Bengals seem to be moving further.Outscored by 99-30 in its last three games Cincinnati cannot make it to its bye week fast enough.BUCCANEERS (5-3) at CHIEFS (1-6)Buccaneers by 9This appears to be a mismatch but Tampa Bay is 1-3 on the road where it is averaging 8 fewer points and allowing 8.5 more. Still these are the Chiefs we’re talking about.FALCONS (4-3) at RAIDERS (2-5)Falcons by 3Matt Ryan and Darren McFadden were taken third and fourth in April’s draft but there may not be a reunion because of McFadden’s injured toes. It must be the shoes the Raiders say.

9,Over Democrats' objections a bill that would extend the state's authority to house its prisoners in county jails was approved yesterday by the Assembly. Joseph V. Doria Jr. the Assembly minority leader said the bill is unfair to counties because the state does not pay the full cost of incarcerating its inmates.Of the 27000 state inmates 4500 are in county jails and the number is growing said Chuck Leitgeib a spokesman for the Assembly's Republican majority. In separate action yesterday the Assembly passed a bill to give Camden County $5.9 million to build a 200-bed addition to its jail.

9,Engineers have found a new use for energy captured from the sun: keeping cars cool.On a sunny summer day the temperature inside a parked car can exceed 140 degrees. That makes it very difficult for people when they enter the car and it can age vinyl and other materials faster.For the last three years though Intersolar Ltd. of England has sold a device that combines solar cells and a ventilation fan. It has been available in the United States only through catalogues but this spring the fan will be sold at Eckerd's Drug Stores and other retail outlets priced at $25.The product called Auto Vent hangs on a rear window that is open just a crack and pushes overheated air out through a slit on top. Cooler air is drawn in through the car's ventilation ducts.Auto Vent is a perfect use for solar cells because they run best when the sun is bright and that is when they are needed most to cool a car.
9,The summit meeting in Moscow made notable advances with the signing of a strategic arms accord and a dramatic commitment to convene a Mideast peace conference in October. But Presidents Bush and Gorbachev both shied away from the hard imperative task of seeking deeper reductions in the nuclear arms that still imperil the world.Both said it would be impractical to eliminate their arsenals at a time when other nations still possess nuclear arms. Mr. Bush expressed particular concern about nuclear weapons in the hands of "renegades." But he seemed to rule out the risk of renegade nationalists or military officers in the Soviet Union gaining access to some of its huge stockpile of weapons. The best way to reduce that risk however remote is to negotiate further cuts.The Start treaty signed yesterday cuts the long-range nuclear arsenals of the two sides for the first time since the superpower arms race began. Just as important it provides a framework of definitions accounting practices and verification procedures that would facilitate further reductions without the need to retrace the long and tortured path that finally produced this treaty.Further reductions are needed because even with a 35 percent cut in Start a chaotic Soviet Union still has 7000 long-range nuclear weapons and thousands more in its shorter-range arsenal. But the Soviets will only reduce these stockpiles if the U.S. agrees to corresponding cuts.

8,JACKEE HARRY a star of the television comedy series ''227'' jokingly describes her cabaret act as ''New York girl makes good goes to Hollywood and goes crazy.'' The remark is typical of the blunt sassy humor that runs through her show which plays at Sweetwater's (170 Amsterdam Avenue at 67th Street) through May 3.Among other comic bits Miss Harry recalls her experiences as a would-be pedicurist and does an amusing send-up of a Hispanic fortune teller giving impromptu readings between choruses of Stevie Wonder's ''Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing.''More confident as a comedienne than as a vocalist Miss Harry is musically comfortable singing light brassy novelties like ''Material Girl'' and ''Freeway of Love.'' The bump-and-grind pop-soul version of Stephen Sondheim's ''Putting It Together'' that opens her show is an amusing travesty. Dramatic ballads however exceed her technical reach. Belting a medley of ''A House Is Not a Home'' and ''Who Can I Turn To?'' at Tuesday's late show Miss Harry was frequently flat. Her version of Laura Nyro's ''Buy and Sell'' lacked the aura of smouldering angst that the song demands and she failed to give ''I Am Changing'' from ''Dreamgirls'' a coherent dramatic shape.
0,Upon arriving at their practice facility for media day Sprewell told the Knicks that his right hand which was visibly swollen was bothering him. The Knicks immediately sent him for X-rays which revealed a fracture of the fifth metacarpal near the knuckle of the pinkie.''He kept it to himself'' a Knicks spokesman said. ''He didn't tell anybody because he didn't think it was a big deal.''Sprewell who will be replaced by Shandon Anderson in the lineup would not comment today and the Knicks refused to make him available to the news media.Though Sprewell could have easily seen when he first noticed pain or swelling Knicks Coach Don Chaney said he was the type of player who could be injured and not realize it. Sprewell's agent Bob Gist said that he spoke with Sprewell on Thursday and that he did not mention the injury.''You've got to understand who we're dealing with'' Chaney said. ''We're dealing with a very tough player probably the toughest player on our team so he's not going to complain about anything. We're always bumping and bruising ourselves and when we have a little swelling here a little soreness there we don't really complain that much about it. And he is the epitome of a guy who doesn't complain about injuries. He bangs himself all the time so I would imagine with him hitting himself he probably said 'Well it's just a bruise no big deal.' ''Though he has largely remade his image during his four seasons with the Knicks Sprewell has been embroiled in more than his share of controversies with the club. Perpetually late for home games Sprewell missed training camp in 1999 because of an unexcused absence. He was fined by the club last season for walking out of a mandatory team meeting at which the Madison Square Garden chairman James L. Dolan was present. And he skipped a pregame shootaround and arrived just 80 minutes before tip-off for a game in Miami late last season. Sprewell was initially fined $125000 -- one game's pay -- for that transgression but after he fought the penalty Dolan rescinded all but $2500 of the fine.The Knicks perhaps fed up with Sprewell's antics tried to trade him this past summer shopping him in an attempt to land point guard Andre Miller now with the Los Angeles Clippers.

0,After taking a tongue lashing from President Obama Chrysler’s holdout lenders got a show of support from The Financial Times’s John Gapper.“Unlike Barack Obama and others I have sympathy for the hedge funds and other investment funds that rejected the Chrysler restructuring offer and forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy” Mr. Gapper wrote in a column titled “In defence of the Chrysler hedge funds.”On Thursday Mr. Obama railed against the holdout lenders now effectively a hostile group of business partners whom he called “speculators.”“They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrifices and they would have to make none” Mr. Obama said of the creditors among them several hedge funds and boutique investment funds. “I don’t stand with them.”Most of the major debtholders led by JPMorgan Chase agreed to write down the debt owed to them by more than two-thirds. That put the onus on the remaining holdouts — including units of OppenheimerFunds Xerion Capital Fund of Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital — which argued they were falling victim to the willingness of their big banking partners in Chrysler to play nice with a government that had helped bail them out as well. Perella Weinberg decided late Thursday that it would accept the government’s terms.Administration officials said the holdouts’ position left them no option but to force Chrysler into bankruptcy.“Well yes” Mr. Gapper wrote “except that some of these ‘speculators’ inconveniently manage money on behalf of pension plans and endowments rather than rapacious rich people. They have a fiduciary duty to get the best deal they can on behalf of their investors.”“I also take seriously their point that although they are higher up in the ranks of creditors than Chrysler’s unions notably the UAW they were offered less for their investments” Mr. Gapper added.The secured lenders contending that they are being unfairly blamed for sending the automaker into bankruptcy protection say that the Obama administration is skirting bankruptcy law by forcing them to take a larger loss on their debt than other Chrysler stakeholders.The group which is calling itself the Committee of Non-TARP Lenders said Thursday that it had been compelled to negotiate through a group of big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that have accepted government bailout money and so are reluctant to push back against the Treasury Department’s proposal. They claim the government has ignored their proposals to restructure Chrysler.Mr. Gapper agreed with that assessment writing: “President Obama is trying to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to shove these investors into taking a worse deal than they could ordinarily expect under Chapter 11. The Tarp-funded banks that voted for the deal were no doubt aware of how they might be pilloried if they did not do so.”However not all industry watchers were feeling the love for the holdout lenders. The Washington Post’s Steven Pearlstein took them to task in a broad swipe at the hedge fund industry.“There may be nothing more pathetic than a hedge-fund manager worked up in a moral lather complaining that he hasn’t been treated fairly. Since when did any of these guys ever worry about fairness?” Mr. Pearlstein wrote.The columnist said he didn’t “recall receiving even a single e-mail from a hedge-fund manager complaining about how unfair it was that the government stepped in to bail out creditors and counterparties of Citigroup Bear Stearns and AIG.”In an editorial on the Chrysler bankruptcy The New York Times said that by pushing the matter into bankruptcy court the administration was assuming that the judge would also reject the holdouts’ demands.“There are reasons to hope it will work out that way. In particular a judge may be unwilling to favor the dissident bondholders when other significant stakeholders have been able to come to agreement outside of court” The New York Times said.Bankruptcy always contains some element of unpredictability and the minority of debtholders who oppose the new arrangement could argue in court that the company is worth more to them in liquidation. Mr. Gapper argued that the holdout creditors may even “have a better chance of getting improved terms from the bankruptcy court than the US administration would have us believe.”Go to Article from The Financial Times »Go to Article from The Washington Post »Go to Item from DealBook »Go to Editorial from The New York Times »Go to Related Article from The New York Times »
9,President Bush refused tonight to sign the $30 billion budget measure for the nation's intelligence agencies. In killing the measure he said his authority to conduct foreign policy would have been violated by a provision requiring him to tell Congress of requests for foreign or private help in covert operations.By withholding his signature Mr. Bush pocket-vetoed the legislation: it could not have become law unless it had been signed within 10 working days after it reached his desk. That deadline expired tonight. Because Congress has adjourned no new spending legislation can be passed until a new Congress convenes in January.It is not clear how the Central Intelligence Agency and other espionage agencies will continue to function legally without authorization to spend money.A C.I.A. spokesman said tonight that the agency had consulted with the Justice Department and "will continue to be able to spend appropriated funds." He would not elaborate. Possible Legal Battle
9,Acting over the objections of 11 of the defendants a Federal judge yesterday postponed for more than two months the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 12 other men accused of conspiring to wage a war of urban terrorism against the United States.Judge Michael B. Mukasey who is presiding in the case set a new trial date of Dec. 5 to give time to newly appointed lawyers to prepare their cases for the defense.Judge Mukasey's decision was made necessary in part by his disqualification last week of the firm of William M. Kunstler and Ronald L. Kuby from defending their remaining client in the trial Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny. The judge accepted a Government motion to disqualify the Kunstler & Kuby firm on the grounds that they had a conflict of interest.Mr. Elgabrowny has engaged a new defense lawyer Anthony Ricco who last week told Judge Mukasey that he would need two or three months to prepare his case.

9,To the Editor:Frank Rich misses an important point in "The Radio Funnies" (column Feb. 17) his criticism of the hiring of Curtis Sliwa by WNYC. Perhaps conservative views not only "have a right to be represented on WNYC" but are also necessary for the New York City station's survival.I consider myself a conservative yet I listen to WNYC more than to any other station because of the quality of its reporting. Yet no open-minded person will argue that WNYC does not give a slanted liberal viewpoint in its news and features.Thomas Morgan WNYC's president must recognize this. Radio stations financed by this city cannot continue to ask for public money by catering only to its liberal constituents. Hence Mr. Sliwa's hiring.I am infuriated by many WNYC features and do not contribute when the station holds fund drives. However I would consider doing so if it balanced its reporting with more conservative views. Maybe Mr. Morgan and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani understand this. PAUL M. SOLENICK White Plains Feb. 21 1994

0,Both winners were a testament to how deep the United States moguls team is and how difficult selecting only seven athletes for the Olympic squad is going to be. Right now Moseley the defending Olympic gold medalist is on the outside looking in after his ninth-place finish today.''At this point I'm in trouble'' said Moseley who has one top-10 World Cup finish this season and is well behind the front-runner Jeremy Bloom. ''I've got four World Cups to go.''Moseley hopes that the more the judges see the dinner roll -- a move that would be illegal if his feet went over his head for an inverted aerial -- the better his chances of scoring well. If they do not come to accept the jump Moseley will have to decide whether he will go back to the blah-blah basics to give himself a shot at making the Olympic team.''I'll either have to change or go to the X Games'' he said.He has made a good living off his flamboyant style and Hollywood smile parlaying his Olympic gold in 1998 in Nagano Japan into film work. But his comeback has been frustrating and the talent on the men's team has proved deeper than most expected.Bloom has come out of nowhere to stand on two World Cup podiums. His decision to defer his football scholarship at the University of Colorado to try out for the Olympic team has paid off. The 19-year-old Bloom used veteran caution and held back today finishing fifth as he nursed a groin injury.

1,PARIS — On Wednesday Virgil Abloh the rising street wear designer and creative director for Kanye West staged the first presentation for his Off-White line in a gallery in the Marais. It was an extended meditation on the white T-shirt and jeans — jeans made both in his Italian factories and by collaboration with Levi’s white T-shirts split and reworked inserted with shoulder pads pleated and Frankensteined together. Mr. Abloh a gregarious and enthusiastic designer was in a chatty mood backstage. Here five things to know about his collection in his own words.He is here to revitalize the jaded.“The whole show was based around this premise this writing on the wall: ‘Why are you here?’ It’s my synopsis of fashion week. After the first show you go out to dinner and say ‘What did you see?’ Everyone’s like ‘Oh nothing.’ ‘What’s really great?’ ‘Oh nothing.’ That’s why I started designing. It’s up to us to design something that’s good for people to look at. We can’t just complain.”But he’s not doing it on his own.“Everyone’s always like ‘Don’t do a show when you start.’ Shows are boring. I feel like doing it small repeating it trying to make it a different type of experience — it’s more like performance art. I flew out my friends from New York and we just sat at dinner and thought of it over wine. I feel like I’m just representing a group of kids rather than being a designer who’s totalitarian. It feels rewarding. I feel like I’m just a vessel for the young fashion kid getting into culture.”

1,On Monday Saint Laurent announced that it had appointed Anthony Vaccarello as creative director following the exit of Hedi Slimane. Here’s what to know about the 33-year-old designer who will present his first collection for the house in October.He’s Belgium-Born and BredBorn in Belgium to Italian parents Vaccarello studied at the art-and-design school La Cambre in Brussels and graduated in 2006; that year he took home the top fashion prize at the annual Hyères Festival in France which focuses on emerging talent. He worked on furs at Fendi for two years before founding his own brand and held his first runway show in September 2010 for the spring 2011 season. He won France’s ANDAM (Association Nationale pour le Développement des Arts de la Mode) award for up-and-coming names the following July. Since then Vaccarello has continued to participate in the Paris calendar; his shows are typically scheduled for the first day of the French capital’s fashion week. It remains unclear if he’ll be shuttering his label upon taking the reins at Saint Laurent.

8,EXHAUST from the smokestacks of oceangoing ships has been added to the list of surprisingly potent human contributions to the earth's climate.The exhaust produces tiny particles aerosols that tend to absorb incoming sunlight and turn it to heat. But scientists studying satellite images have found a far more important effect: the same particles serve as seeds for the formation of cloud particles.As a result where ships have passed by clouds tend to be made up of more and smaller particles. That lets them reflect more sunlight than similar but unpolluted clouds making them brighter from space especially at wavelengths near the infrared.The researchers believe that the cooling effect of the pollution substantially outweighs the warming effect of absorption by the particles themselves. The findings were reported in Science by experts from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

9,NOT everyone is a born gardener but some of us pretend. So I visited the hardware store to select seeds for my suburban garden and after consulting the almanac on a shelf for information chose peepers tulips and helicopters. Taking the envelopes to the garden I planted and watered the seeds and sped up the calendar so that each day took 10 seconds to pass. For this was a computer game or simulation Forever Growing Garden by Media Vision of Fremont Calif.The cat watched from inside the house through a window and soon a bluebird flew over to taunt it. A gopher also surfaced but when I tried to catch him I caught a skunk instead. Finally two beautiful peepers started to pop through but as of this moment (it is Aug. 2; whoops now it's Aug. 3) there is no sign of the tulips or helicopters the latter being fantasy plants.The program offers three settings: the suburban flower garden a vegetable patch or the grounds of a medieval castle. Depending on the choice the hardware store will offer appropriate seeds. After or if you have successfully grown the flowers or vegetables you will be able to harvest the vegetables and take them to market to sell cut the flowers and arrange them in a vase or trim the castle's hedges into Scissorshands patterns. Gardens can be saved on disk and reopened later and there are surprises hidden here and there.Forever Growing Garden comes as a CD-ROM. The one disk works with PC's running Windows 3.1 or most Macintoshes running System 7.0 or later. The suggested list price is $39.95.

0,Brazil's economy grew at its fastest pace in the third quarter in eight years lifted by surging exports and a sharp increase in domestic consumption. The government's statistics agency said that gross domestic product expanded 6.1 percent from July through September compared with the year-earlier period. The most recent performance was the fastest growth rate for the quarter since 1996. When compared with the second quarter however the economy grew a more modest 1 percent slightly below most forecasts. All sectors of the economy expanded in the quarter with exports soaring 18.2 percent from a year ago and industrial output rising 7 percent. Household consumption meanwhile rose 5.7 percent the biggest increase since 1997. Brazil's economy South America's largest is expected to grow 4.66 percent this year. But growth is expected to slow to about 3.5 percent in 2005 as a recent increase in interest rates threatens to weigh on the economy. The government also revised last year's growth numbers saying the economy expanded 0.54 percent in 2003 instead of shrinking 0.2 percent. Todd Benson (NYT)
0,Andrew H. Walker/Getty ImagesThe sun is out and the sky is (somewhat) blue for Day 2 of All Points West but the fans are still stepping cautiously as they make their way through the front gates. Thanks to Friday’s rain the grounds of Liberty State Park in Jersey City are a patchwork of muddy puddles and soggy grass with only the occasional oasis of pavement or woodchips.But by the time the crowd got to White Rabbits a Brooklyn band that opened the main stage they had gotten as acclimated to muddy calves as they were probably ever going to be and settled into the usual rock-festival roles: fearless dancers up front intra-stage browsers toward the back and Hacky Sack-ers off the sides.Eric Thayer/ReutersSo far the crowds are thin for the second day which features Tool My Bloody Valentine Gogol Bordello Neko Case Arctic Monkeys and lots more. But it’s early and that schlep from the ferry takes a while.Yet it’s not clear just how crowded it will get. Attendance figures haven’t been released yet but none of the festival’s three days have sold out in advance. Last night the festival announced that tickets for Friday could be used for free admission Saturday or Sunday a concession to the inclement weather on Friday. It’s also a way to help with one of any festival’s primary goals: to get lots and lots of people through the gate and onto the grass. Or as the case may be the mud.Related: Day 1 Coverage of All Points West

9,Moving to rescue the nation's capital from financial paralysis the Senate today approved a $660 million appropriation for the city just after Washington's Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly finished describing at a news conference how she planned to halt much of the government.Without the appropriation which the House had already approved the District of Columbia would have suspended operations at midnight except the functions essential to protect life and property. President Clinton this evening signed the measure the last of the 13 appropriation bills for the new fiscal year which starts Saturday.But while city officials scrambled to complete their emergency plans senators kept them on pins and needles as they spent hours debating whether to intervene in the major league baseball strike waxing nostalgic about youthful trips to the ball park or praising idle home teams.Senator Bob Graham Democrat of Florida called his high school graduation gift a trip to the 1955 World Series in New York "one of the jewels of my life."

All the seats here are red although with seemingly everyone wearing the same color it’s tough to tell who’s standing or sitting.This is my second opening day as a beat writer and the third one I’ve covered and it never ceases to amaze me how subdued the clubhouse is beforehand. When I walked in the Mets’ clubhouse at 3:40 CDT this is what I saw:*Jose Reyes and Lastings Milledge sitting reading copies of Baseball America.*Jose Valentin plopped in front of his locker working on a SuDoku puzzle.*Ambiorix Burgos breaking in his glove in front of his locker with headphones on.*Aaron Sele feet up on a shelf reading “Crossroads of Twilight“.*Endy Chavez playing golf on his PSP.*Paul Lo Duca on a couch trying to watch golf on one TV and the Suns-Mavericks game on another.*Tom Glavine munching on some Cheerios.In other news the Cardinals are honoring their 1982 world championship team tonight and Keith Hernandez the SNY broadcaster and former Met was introduced. During our pregame interview session with Willie Randolph the manager was incredulous that Hernandez was taking part as a Cardinal and then in a week was throwing out the first pitch at the Mets’ home opener.“He’s a Met; he’s not a Cardinal” Randolph said.

9,Seven months after he announced that he was leaving office President Carlos Saul Menem says he will run for re-election if his supporters can legally overturn a constitutional ban prohibiting a third consecutive term.Mr. Menem's aides say that he is convinced that the country needs him in office to resist the financial contagion spreading from neighboring Brazil and that he is committed to negotiating a treaty with the United States during the next few years that would replace the peso with the dollar as Argentina's currency.''If there's a possibility of running in the primaries I'll do it'' Mr. Menem said in a radio interview on Friday.Mr. Menem remains far behind in the polls and with the ruling Justicialist Party's primary vote due in May or June and the general election scheduled for October he may be running out of time. But since he was first elected as a dark-horse candidate in 1989 he has repeatedly surprised analysts with his political resourcefulness and cunning.
7,UNITED NATIONS N. Y. Dec. 1—Britain today suggested a renewal of negotiating efforts toward reopening the Suez Canal.Sir Colin Crowe the British Permanent Representative here declared in the General Assembly that such arrangements—if accepted by Egypt and Israel—could “unlock the door” to an eventual settlement in the Middle East.The United States last year actively pressed both countries to accept an interim arrangement involving the holding of indirect or “proximity” talks in New York. Today an American official said that the offer “still stands.”But Egypt's Foreign Minister Dr. Mohammed H. El‐Zayyat said that he had no indication of any new initiatives being considered by Washington although there have been reports of such moves in recent days.

9,A Federal law intended to restrict paroles for violent felons has become a stumbling block in state budget negotiations with Gov. George E. Pataki and the Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver trading accusations of dishonesty and competing interpretations of the law.Strictly speaking it is not a budget matter. The state stands to lose $24 million this year in Federal aid for prison construction if it does not comply with Federal parole guidelines passed last year that require violent offenders to serve on average at least 85 percent of their sentences. But that is a pittance next to the $635 million the Governor wants to spend this year on new prison space let alone the $66 billion budget. State officials say New York has until Tuesday night to apply for the Federal grant.Nor is it strictly speaking a matter of how much time prisoners serve. A state with prisoners serving relatively short sentences can qualify for the Federal grant if it denies all paroles while another state that grants paroles might not qualify even if its prisoners serve longer terms.Mr. Pataki a Republican insists that the state has not met the Federal standard and that it ought to deny parole to all first-time violent felons. Mr. Silver a Democrat from Manhattan says he believes that the state qualifies. And the Justice Department says the answer is unclear.
1,To the Editor:Re “Can Joe Biden Be Forgiven?” by Lucy Flores (Op-Ed April 30):I believe that the reason Mr. Biden is not doing a satisfying apology to either Anita Hill or Ms. Flores (and anyone else he was too physical with) is that he is still hoping to appeal to President Trump’s male voters and he doesn’t want his apology to be campaign fodder for Mr. Trump however well meaning it may be.The problem for Mr. Biden is that he may be overestimating what an apology means to men at the expense of underestimating its meaning to women.Gayle Pickard-FishmanEnglewood N.J.To the Editor:Studies have revealed that those who refuse to apologize after hurting others feel more powerful as a result. Conversely those who do apologize feel less powerful even as they stand to benefit by repairing a fractured relationship.As disappointing as it may be it should come as no surprise that both our president and those vying for his position seem oddly allergic to those two little words: I’m sorry.

1,Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesThursday’s 11:30 a.m. session at the Bikram Yoga NYC studio in the Flatiron District began as usual: a handful of half-dressed students slowly flapped their elbows as they decelerated their breath and stared at themselves in the mirror. After paying as much as $25 each they began their mindful workouts in the 105-degree “Torture Chamber” while outside on Fifth Avenue pedestrians scurried past in coats.A few blocks away on West 27th Street about 30 pupils soon began the same breathing exercises dripping with sweat in the 103-degree heat. But this class labeled “Traditional Hot Yoga” and offered by the growing studio chain Yoga to the People cost just $8.“Yoga should be for everyone” Matt Hillock a blissed-out wrung-out student said after the lower-priced class.But Bikram Choudhury the millionaire founder of Bikram Yoga believes his kind of yoga belongs to him — he has even copyrighted it. Now he has sued Yoga to the People for copyright infringement seeking monetary damages and asking a federal judge to block Yoga to the People from offering its hot yoga class.“We sent an investigator to take the classes” Robert Gilchrest Mr. Choudhury’s lawyer said on Thursday. “The classes were virtually mirror images and the dialogue was consistently the same.”Despite yoga’s long history Mr. Gilchrest said that Mr. Choudhury had the right to claim his own 26-posture sequence and the instructor’s dialogue.“Words have been in existence since women and men started speaking but you can copyright a sequence of words” Mr. Gilchrest said.The founder of the Yoga to the People studios Greg Gumucio began as Mr. Choudhury’s student. He said the guru enlightened him by saying “You are your own teacher. You are responsible for your own experience.”That led Mr. Gumucio to the realization that high-profile (and expensive) instructors were not necessary for successful yoga study. And in 2006 he opened Yoga to the People in the East Village. Now the chain which also offers its classes in non-heated rooms on a voluntary-donation basis has five studios in New York and one each in San Francisco and Berkeley Calif. and Seattle.Mr. Choudhury’s suit (see also below) filed in California where Bikram is based has a different philosophy — that he is responsible for students’ success. Aspiring Bikram teachers must take his formal nine-week $7000 course. Once certified instructors must obtain his permission to open studios.The suit reported Wednesday by the Manhattan news site DNAinfo calls Mr. Gumucio’s instructors “impostors” and charges that he broke his agreement to follow Mr. Choudhury’s rules.The rivalry has been brewing for some time. In August another Bikram outlet Bikram Yoga Manhattan said it was closing one of its studios because “the presence of our competitors” namely Yoga to the People “has made it impossible for us to continue.”Mr. Gumucio however said he never agreed to abide by Mr. Choudhury’s rules and that was why he split with him.“For almost five years I worked with Bikram was often a guest in his home and he in mine” Mr. Gumucio wrote in an e-mail. “I have never agreed with Bikram and his idea that he owned the yoga or that he should sue anyone.”Mr. Choudhury has taken legal action against imitators before. He is currently suing two other studios for copyright infringement Mr. Gilchrest said and he reached a monetary settlement with a Los Angeles studio in 2003.One regular student of Yoga to the People Diane Pamphile pronounced Mr. Choudhury’s suit “mean.““I’m a student” she said. “We can’t afford expensive yoga classes. I commute from Queens just to come here.” She is one of more than 3000 signers of a petition on the Web site yogatruth.org that defends Yoga to the People’s ability to continue teaching the style.Chelsea Channing Portney 23 a Bikram student for nearly five years said she loves the classes but doesn’t think Mr. Choudhury should be able to claim the poses as his own.“I don’t believe that Bikram should be able to own those moves since they have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years” she said.Still she will keep going to the classes. “While I don’t agree with Bikram I personally love my teachers and the people I have met” she said.Mr. Gumucio said that his sequence of poses is not exactly the same as Mr. Choudhury’s.“I cringe at the thought of the far far reaching ramifications that this lawsuit holds” he wrote. “If the originators of this traditional knowledge had attempted to copyright trademark or own in any way yoga a yoga pose a yoga sequence then perhaps nobody today would have the joy of experiencing yoga.”In a 2007 op-ed in The New York Times the writer Suketu Mehta noted that the United States had issued 150 yoga-related copyrights and called Mr. Choudhury’s legal actions “a gross violation of the tradition of yoga.”“There is a line in the Hindu scriptures: ‘Let good knowledge come to us from all sides’ ” Mr. Mehta wrote. “There is no follow-up that adds ‘And let us pay royalties for it.’ ”

1,RANCHO PALOS VERDES Calif. — The technology elite gathered for the annual AllThingsD conference here to discuss everything from the mood in Silicon Valley to the latest technology gadgets and services. Here are a few highlights.Stephanie Diani for The New York TimesZynga no-showMark Pincus the chief executive of Zynga was scheduled to speak at the conference. But Mr. Pincus told conference hosts Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg last week that he couldn’t make it. Mr. Pincus didn’t give “any reason whatsoever” for his absence the hosts said. That of course got people talking. And on the conference floor what I heard most often is that Mr. Pincus didn’t show because Zynga is about to file for a public offering.Zynga has declined to comment about its plans for an I.P.O. plans but people briefed on the company’s plans have said that it may file as soon as this month.I.P.O.s everywhere or nowhere?On the heels of the LinkedIn public offering the parade of hot Internet companies presenting at the D9 conference were asked about their I.P.O. plans. Dick Costolo the chief executive of Twitter would not comment despite persistent questions about it. Andrew Mason the chief executive of Groupon declined to answer. Next Jack Dorsey gave what was probably the best answer to the I.P.O. question. “Which one?” Mr. Dorsey is chief executive of Square the hot mobile payments startup and he is also chairman and head of product at Twitter. Of course he also declined to comment on any specific I.P.O. plans.The public offerings of Groupon Zynga and others are coming and are certain to fuel more talk of a bubble. In the meantime LinkedIn closed at $77.45 down 5 percent on Wednesday. Shares are down 37 percent from their peak of $122.70 and below the opening price of $83 on May 19 its first day of trading.Groupon zingersThe audience consensus was that Mr. Mason gave the best interview explaining his company’s business and answering questions with poise and humor. When asked why he didn’t sell Groupon to Google which last year offered about $6 billion for the company he answered with an expressionless stare (some in the audience called it the “death stare”).He also delivered a few good zingers. Asked about competition from Google which began testing its Offers product in Portland Ore. on Wednesday he that he was particularly impressed with one thing: “The Buzz integration is seamless” he said. For those who have forgotten Buzz is Google’s spectacularly failed attempt to build a social network on top of Gmail. Finally he responded to a question about Groupon’s potential by saying that the entire retail economy was more than $12 trillion and that if Groupon could get 10 percent of that he’d be happy.Ricoh’s pad demoRicoh the Japanese maker of cameras copiers and printers is the latest entrant in the tablet market which is dominated by Apple’s iPad. But rather than going head-to-head with the iPad Ricoh’s eWriter Solution is a lightweight e-Ink tablet that looks more like a large-screen Kindle that you can write on. Ricoh said the tablet is a replacement for clipboards and paper forms that are still widely used in businesses. You may use it to fill out forms at the doctor’s office to sign for a delivery of a package or by an insurance adjuster filling a form for a new claim. The flip side of its limitations is that it is very simple to use. “It was designed to be so simple that people could walk out with it and know how to use it” said Ron Barr vice president of marketing for Ricoh. It will cost $500 and come with a set of services that will allow companies to manage the tablets and will be available in summer.Fanhattan searchTrying to decide what to watch on your iPad is not easy. You have to go app by app — say Netflix iTunes and others — to see what’s available. Fanhattan a new free iPad app allows you to search through all major apps in one go. If you search for “127 Hours” for example it will show you all the apps where the movie is available. Clicking through to reviews and previews is easy and the service works for both movies and television shows. It reminded me of Clicker.com a service for searching and discovering Web video that was acquired by CBS in March. While Fanhattan works on the iPad only Gilles BianRosa the chief executive said the company plans to make a similar app for Internet connected televisions.Inkling textbooksI also got a peek at Inkling a new iPad app that will be unveiled on Thursday and that offers college students digital versions of their textbooks. Inkling has worked with some major textbook publishers to turn some of their titles into interactive books that look beautiful on the iPad and include video and audio. Matt MacInnis founder and chief executive of Inkling was a longtime employee at Apple where he worked in market development for educational products. He said that by fall Inkling will have about 100 of the most used textbooks. The company is backed by Sequoia Capital and a chorus of angel investors. It will compete with Kno which is also working to digitize textbooks for tablets and was unveiled at the same conference last year.Say cheeseSpeaking of Sequoia-backed companies another one was introduced at the conference on Wednesday. The Melt describes itself as an innovative fast casual restaurant. It was founded by Jonathan Kaplan the creator of the Flip Video business and is opening with four locations in the San Francisco area. It plans to expand to 500 outlets in five years. The Melt let attendees taste its grilled cheese sandwiches which were definitely more analog than digital.

7,Ilie Nastase won't have the United States Open to kick around anymore. The temperamental Rumanian seeded No. 7 in singles was ousted in the second round of the tennis championships yesterday by Corrado Barazzutti of Italy 6‐4 6‐4 and then dropped out of the doubles shortly afterward.“Nastase phoned me from his hotel” said Bob Howe the assistant referee “saying he was so tired and his leg hurt so he was going home and rest.”Nastase's defeat was a surprise—but not the only one—on a stiflingly humid day at Forest Hills Queens. On an afternoon that saw four former champions make an early exit from the tournament Stan Smith seeded No. 16 bowed to Mike Fishbach and Fishbach's controversial “spaghetti” racquet 6‐0 6‐2. Fishbach a 22‐year‐old qualifier from Great Neck L.I. is playing in his first Open.Stolle Also LosesSmith the winner of the 1971 Open and Nastase who won in ‘72 were part of the group of defeated champions that included Fred Stolle of Australia the 1966 victor and Maria Bueno of Brazil who won the women's crown in 1966. Stolle lost to fifth‐seeded Manuel Orantes of Spain 6‐2 6‐2 while Miss Bueno dropped a 6‐2 6‐3 verdict to Virginia Ruzici of Rumania.

0,To the Editor:Re "Search and Rescue" by Tim O'Reilly (Op-Ed Sept. 28):The Authors Guild's objections to Google's plan to offer a searchable database of the collections of five libraries is analogous to the Recording Industry Association of America's imposition of limitations on digital radio (including "terrestrial" stations with Internet simulcasts) through its lobbying of Congress during creation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.The goal was to stop the spread of music file-sharing but restricting the number of songs noncommercial radio can play by an artist in a given time period reduces the positive effect exposure can have on establishing the artist.With 38 years in "terrestrial" radio in New York I know that the more songs I can play in a concentrated time the greater the listener excitement and the more apt that excited listener is to buy the album.If authors want their work to survive it had better be in digital libraries. If record companies want to establish new artists they should support outlets that offer exposure. Why tie the very hands that are trying help these artists achieve their goals?

Mr. Obama has yet to nominate people to fill many of those jobs while others remain vacant because Senate Republicans have refused to allow votes on his selections.The comptroller’s office has lacked a permanent leader for almost a year.Senator Tim Johnson the South Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the banking committee issued a statement praising Mr. Curry and pledging to advance his nomination “as quickly as possible.”“Tom has been a strong effective director at the F.D.I.C. for the past seven years and his experience should serve him well as the next comptroller of the currency” Mr. Johnson said.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The comptroller’s office has fought with considerable success to exempt national banks from the requirements of state laws. The financial legislation passed last year required the agency to revisit the issue and last month it issued a proposal that would leave its longstanding policies essentially unchanged.In response the Treasury Department took the unprecedented step of submitting a public comment to the agency criticizing its proposal for ignoring the law’s intent.Mr. Curry who spent almost a decade running a state banking agency has made it clear that he believes that states should have more latitude to apply laws that protect consumers.His current thoughts are likely to be a central subject at his confirmation hearing.Ms. Miller joined the Treasury Department last year.

0,The Mandelring Quartet from Germany has won a handful of prizes since the early 1990's and has made a handful of recordings that range from standard repertory to rarities by Georges Onslow and contemporary works by Berthold Goldschmidt and Allan Pettersson. It should be better known in the United States and the Frick Collection has been doing its part on the quartet's behalf: on Sunday afternoon the collection presented it in its round chamber music room for the third time since 1994.There is a lot to like about this group starting with a taut throaty tone a fluid approach to color and an impeccable sense of style. The performance of Schubert's Quartet in G minor (D. 173) that opened the program was beefy and dramatic at first but eventually countered this current of Romantic storminess in Schubert's style with a measure of clear-eyed Classicism. The Andantino and the Menuetto in fact had a Mozartean courtliness and even the finale stopped short of returning to the Romanticism of the opening movement reveling in a folksy briskness instead.The warm rounded sound of the Schubert was retained -- but also reconfigured -- in the group's account of Shostakovich's Quartet No. 4 (Op. 83). Shostakovich's lines pull toward an icy stridency and the Mandelring players followed those impulses part of the way stopping short of harshness but conveying all the work's wrenching energy.That intensity couched in an unambiguously warm glow informed the group's performance of Beethoven's C sharp minor Quartet (Op. 131). This is Beethoven at his most mercurial the connected movements shifting quickly between heart-tugging bittersweet meditations and unalloyed playfulness. The musicians had the nimbleness that these sudden changes demand as well as the ensemble precision to make the work's disparate movements cohere.

0,The battle with city officials also illustrates the potential political fallout that states' schools chiefs risk as they use the more muscular options of the law for schools that fail to improve over many years.The moratorium on taking control an amendment to a schools construction bill would bar the state from initiating any actions toward a takeover until June 2007. The votes in the heavily Democratic legislature were largely along party lines with Democrats winning large enough margins in the two houses to override an expected veto from Mr. Ehrlich.In a statement he accused lawmakers of "fighting for the status quo at the expense of Baltimore city schoolchildren."Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

"This is not the time to pull the rug out from reform efforts that are starting to work."He called the takeover "a blatant political move."Dr. Grasmick who spent Friday defending her actions to lawmakers said she was not completely surprised by the response. Friday was the last day that the Legislature could act to block the takeover and still have time to override a veto.The bill reached the governor's desk just minutes before the 5 p.m. deadline."I think it's unconscionable" said Dr. Grasmick who has been superintendent since 1992 under three governors. She denied any political motivation."There comes a time when you have to think about what is the right thing to do" she said.If lawmakers indeed override an expected veto she predicted "business as usual for another year."She said that other state superintendents who considered using the No Child Left Behind law to wrest control of chronically failing schools should anticipate the same firestorm that she faced.Officials of the federal Education Department appeared to lend Dr. Grasmick moral support but could offer little else. Although the federal law gives states the authority to take over schools it does not address extraordinary measures like legislative intervention carried out on Friday.Advertisement Continue reading the main story"Leadership requires talking about the right things and doing the right things and sometimes you take your knocks when you do that" said Henry Johnson the federal assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education.

1,Patrick Mcdermott/Getty ImagesThere’s a stereotype of tennis — fair or not — that it is a gentlemen’s sport. The players like the game itself are supposed to be polite and mild-mannered individuals with affluent backgrounds.Alex Bogomolov is not like that. And he knows it.“I grew up differently” he said. “I’m not the uptight tennis player most people think of.”Bogomolov who lost in men’s doubles Thursday will take the court again Friday against Rogerio Dutra da Silva of Brazil in the second round of men’s singles. He defeated Steve Johnson with whom he has played doubles in the past in the first round Wednesday.“I didn’t do too many things well besides mentally give myself a chance to stay in the match” Bogomolov said. “The good thing is I always fight through the adversity.”That resiliency is rooted in his upbringing. Russian immigrants his family did not live the lavish lifestyle his tennis peers enjoyed. Instead he had a passionate father also named Alex who was a prominent tennis player in the Soviet Union and went on to become a successful coach.When he was 9 the Bogomolovs moved to Mexico then two years later to Miami where Bogomolov Sr. ran a tennis academy.Bogomolov Jr. and his sister also took to tennis and were coached by their father and his sister’s traveling schedule led Bogomolov Sr. to go on the road much of the year. To continue developing as a player an 11-year-old Bogomolov was sent to Brooklyn to work with a friend of his father. Over the next decade Bogomolov spent half the year in Brooklyn and the other half in Miami honing his game.In New York Bogomolov and his friends attended the Open each summer but never paid for a ticket; they would find a way to sneak in. The group would look for fights and at 16 Bogomolov landed in a holding cell after he was arrested for fighting at the Port Washington Tennis Academy. Still Bogomolov takes pride in his upbringing.“I feel like everybody wanted to prove to the others that we got each other’s backs” Bogomolav said. “It was just the way it was.”Bogomolov’s resiliency has been tested more than in just Wednesday’s match.First there was the pressure of not living up to the expectations as a top junior player.Then there was a messy divorce from the tennis player Ashley Harkleroad whom he married when he was 21 and divorced two years later.“I was in debt for a long time because of it” he said. “I would have a good result pay off some of the debt then not do so well. I never had any momentum.”Another blow came in 2008. During an event in South Korea Bogomolov fell on his wrist but felt no pain and went on to win the match. He woke up the next day unable to move the wrist. A doctor’s visit revealed he had torn ligaments.“It was like a knockout punch” Bogomolov said.Bogomolov was told he might never be able to use a two-handed backhand again. Then came a break that he said changed his life. A week after returning from Korea he met Luana Goncalves at a car convention in Miami. The two remained in contact and in the week leading up to his surgery in January 2009 he stayed in New Jersey with Goncalves who moved to the United States from Brazil as a child.After surgery Bogomolov took a job as a consultant for a tennis academy in New York with hopes of getting back on the court. But rehabbing did not go as well as expected and he could not hit a ball without pain.Then he got some unexpected news.“I came back from work one day and she told me she was pregnant” Bogomolov said of Goncalves. “A week after that I was hitting full-on backhands. It was a miracle because before that I couldn’t even hit a backhand.”With another mouth to feed Bogomolov knew he had to get back on the court to make some money.“He realized that it was now or never” Goncalves said.Three months later in June 2009 he was back on tour. He lost in last year’s United States Open qualifying tournament but qualified for every Grand Slam event this year advancing to the third round of Wimbledon in June. At 28 when most players are on the decline Bogomolov is now ranked 44th the highest in his career.He credits his son Maddox now 20 months old and Goncalves for putting him in line.“I don’t get out of hand like I used to” he said. “After a loss I would get drunk and depressed. With her it was a big issue we had to change. Right away she changed that. She wouldn’t let me do that. I would pout and she would tell me to change my mentality.”

8,''Because they say it is politics but it is not politics'' he said. ''This is what we are.''He added ''The church cannot let itself die'' by giving up its advocacy of social justice. Church Report on RightsThe church in Chile has been harshly critical of the Pinochet Government since shortly after he took power in 1973 through a military coup that overthrew the Marxist Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens.On Monday night the church accused the Government of trampling on human rights and stepping up the use of torture against its opponents. The church's human rights organization said in a report that deaths from political violence rose 42 percent last year reported cases of torture were up almost 30 percent and arrests on politically related charges increased nearly 25 percent.''It shows once again the continuation of norms that do not favor human rights of repeated complaints of attacks on personal liberty of people's deaths in conditions of violence of the use of torture and unnecessary violence against detainees'' the report said.Over the last 13 years President Pinochet has justified repressive measures as necessary to defend the country from a Communist threat most recently represented by a growing left-wing insurgency. System 'Currently Dictatorial'Asked by a reporter today to compare the situations in Chile and in his native Poland John Paul said ''We are going to encounter a system which is currently dictatorial but which is transitory by its own definition.''In Poland he said there are no signs that dictatorship will give way and so the struggle of the people there is ''much more demanding and difficult'' than in Chile.

9,B-2 or not B-2? Once again that is the question as a Congressional conference committee convenes to resolve differences on the defense budget. The President wanted full funding for four of the bat-winged Stealth bombers in this year's budget. The Senate went along by a narrow 51-to-48 vote. But the House overwhelmingly gave the right answer to the question how many B-2's does the nation need: None.President Bush's insistence on spending $3.2 billion for more B-2's along with $5.2 billion he wants for strategic defenses contradicts his own appreciation of modern realities. Consider what he said Friday: "New leaders in the Kremlin and the republics are now questioning the need for their huge nuclear arsenal." The Warsaw Pact has "crumbled." And any threat of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe has evaporated."As a result" he rightly concludes "we now have an unparalleled opportunity to change the nuclear posture of both the United States and the Soviet Union." Then why buy four more B-2's? Mr. Bush offers no convincing answer.Congress is already committed to building 15 of the bombers; the Pentagon wants 75 eventually. The B-2's staunchest defender in Congress Senator Sam Nunn chairman of the Armed Services Committee now says no more than half that number need be built. Even that figure looks reckless considering President Bush's view expressed Friday that "we can dramatically shrink the arsenal of the world's weapons."

0,DES MOINES _ Mike Huckabee held a little event here on Tuesday to thank the roughly 700 bloggers who he said were responsible for keeping his campaign alive. Because he had no money and initially got very little media attention he said he could not have kept going without their dedication.He said the bloggers whom he called his “secret weapon” spent their days “pounding their keyboards and hitting ‘send’ in the middle of the night.” Ed Rollins his campaign consultant said none of the bloggers were on Mr. Huckabee’s payroll chuckling at the idea of a payroll.At one point Chuck Norris Mr. Huckabee’s most famous supporter wandered into the small meeting room where the event was being held. Mr. Norris the martial artist and action actor confessed to being “computer illiterate” himself but thanked the bloggers for getting him and Mr. Huckabee together.Mr. Norris proposed holding a fund-raiser for Mr. Huckabee with a “virtual barbecue” at his Texas ranch on Jan. 20. He said he would take the blogosphere on a virtual tour of the ranch including his 2000-square-foot gym and perhaps Mr. Huckabee would sing with his band. One blogger proposed that all bloggers hold actual barbecues in their home towns at the same time to raise money. The bloggers applauded their approval.“Pork across America!” Mr. Huckabee proclaimed.About a dozen or so bloggers had set up their laptops to take notes and blog as Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Norris spoke; the mainstream media was allowed to observe but not ask questions.Mr. Huckabee had a rough time yesterday at the hands of the media when he announced he was canceling a negative ad against Mitt Romney and then showed the ad to the assembled reporters who burst out laughing. Today he turned the tables. He noted that the mainstream media might be “filing a bad story” right now and if the bloggers were relying on the same wireless system at the hotel they might be “clogging up the lines” and preventing them from filing.If that’s the case “thank you” he said. “You’re doing the Lord’s work.”Mr. Huckabee was asked if he became president whether he would hold an event like this one in the White House. He said he would. “You gotta dance with the one that brought you” he said.Afterwards Anthony Bonna 20 a blogger from Florida who is a student at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. said he supported Mr. Huckabee because he is “the authentic conservative” in the race. His Web site is devoted to him.

0,A committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court filed suit in Little Rock today asking a state court to enforce its recommendation that President Clinton be stripped of his law license for falsely denying under oath that he had a sexual relationship with Monica S.

8,Some fans may think that the saturation point may have been reached with the arrival of the United States Football League this year but there is more professional football on the way. And the backers of the new league say they are serious.Yesterday plans were announced for the 12-team International Football League to begin operations next spring in New York Chicago Florida Hawaii Houston Los Angeles Milwaukee Nebraska North Carolina Ohio the San Francisco Bay area and Tennessee. The league which will be in direct competition with the U.S.F.L. does not have a television commitment but is negotiating with NBC and with the USA cable network according to Jerry Saperstein a vice president at Madison Square Garden who would operate the New York franchise with Richard Stein an attorney. NBC through a spokesman Kevin Monaghan confirmed that there had been ''preliminary discussions'' last week. USA officials also confirmed talks and said future discussions were a possibility.''We wouldn't be here if we didn't think we had a chance to be on national or cable television'' said Dennis Murphy a league vice president who helped found the American Basketball Association the World Hockey Association and World Team Tennis. ''Perhaps in time good sense might bring about a merger with the U.S.F.L.''''We'll compete with the U.S.F.L. for free agents and guys who don't make it in the National Football League'' said Ray Malavasi the former coach of the Los Angeles Rams and a consultant to the league who said that he expected to coach one of the teams in California. ''And we can offer an opportunity to kids who don't like sitting on N.F.L. benches.''

0,''The faculty is nervous'' said Dr. Larry Frohman a neurological ophthalmologist at University Hospital in Newark part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. ''Many of us think is that this is about money not excellence. My feeling is that the commission was handed its conclusions before the report was written.''The plan unveiled in October by a commission appointed by Governor McGreevey recommended that the three research universities be recast as a single university of 64000 students with semiautonomous campuses in Newark New Brunswick and Camden. It also recommended consolidating leadership of the proposed new university by creating the position of chancellor. The commission that produced the 114-page report was headed by Dr. P. Roy Vagelos a retired chief executive of Merck & Company who is a former faculty member of several medical schools.The plan has been embraced by the New Jersey Institute of Technology and tepidly endorsed by Rutgers. But current and former officials at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey have been highly critical of the proposed merger which is not surprising since the commission report lamented the school's reputation and said acidly that ''the goal of excellence has not been achieved.''The volley was recently returned by Stanley S. Bergen former president of the university who said: ''The report's methodology is inconsistent and poorly documented. It scrutinizes U.M.D.N.J. under a microscope examines Rutgers with the naked eye and glances at N.J.I.T. through a telescope.''Any reorganization would require the approval of the State Legislature and take years to put in place. First the governor plans to appoint a task force that will develop a blueprint for creating the new university. As Mr. McGreevey has frequently said his overarching goal is the improvement of the state's medical schools with the goal of attracting tens of millions of dollars in federal and private grants for medical and biotechnical research.

1,Week Three of the Christine O’Donnell comic hostage crisis: As promised Bill Maher pressed on with his Friday night embarrassment-by-installment campaign. He’s trying and failing so far to goad Delaware’s Republican/Tea Party candidate for Senate into appearing on his current HBO show “Real Time” by airing wacky comments from her appearances on his old ABC show “Politically Incorrect.”Race Profile The Delaware Senate Race The Tea Party movement scored another victory when it helped propel a dissident Republican Christine O’Donnell to an upset win over Representative Michael N. Castle.The latest clip like the first one where she explains her teenage flirtation with witchcraft reveals her affinity for religious experimentation — not to mention Italian food.“I was dabbling in witchcraft I’ve dabbled in Buddhism” said Ms. O’Donnell. “I would have become a Hare Krishna but I didn’t want to become a vegetarian … because I’m Italian and I love meatballs.”In an interview with Christian Broadcast News this week O’Donnell was firmly in the Christian rather than Krishna camp saying that God was keeping her in the race.“We marched on because we knew God was not releasing us to quit” she said adding about the prospect of joining Congress immediately after the election “and now with such an important lame duck session you realize why we were to endure all that stuff.”Social conservatives consider O’Donnell’s ability to talk about her “faith journey” the key to what makes her a compelling new voice as The Times’s Mark Leibovich wrote.O’Donnell who got her start as a nationwide personality with 22 appearances on Maher’s show told Leibovich that her dad dabbled in comedy himself. He was Philadelphia’s Bozo the Clown.

1,Yet it did. On Oct. 2 came the denouement. There was a protest meeting that afternoon in the Plaza of Tlatelolco. The army had been given orders to dissolve the meeting but their assault ended in a cross-fire between soldiers and the mysterious “Olympic Battalion” a paramilitary group created by the government posted in nearby buildings.It was the unarmed students who paid with their lives. The hellish violence went on for hours. No one knows the exact number of dead. There was talk of hundreds. Perhaps there were even less than 100 slain but the scenes of horror the arrests and imprisonments the revelations of torture would linger in our collective memory down to the present day.Over the years various theories about the massacre have been proposed. The C.I.A. seemed to believe in a conspiracy forged in Cuba a theory that was brandished by Mr. Díaz Ordaz. However for better or for worse such an idea was highly unlikely since Mexico was the only Latin-American country that had refused to break off relations with Castro. In his unpublished memoirs Mr. Díaz Ordaz asserts that Mexico was “at war.” The students were “the opponents.” After the killings he would write in a tone of satisfaction “They finally obtained their insignificant deaths (sus muertitos).”The real war unleashed in 1968 Mexico was the struggle for the presidential succession in 1970. As had been the custom since 1929 a Mexican president would designate his successor. Various government secretaries would wage a no-holds-barred struggle to gain presidential favor. Luis Echeverría secretary of the interior would finally be the winner because in the eyes of Mr. Díaz Ordaz he showed “more pants” and was “the boldest.” And he also effectively nourished the president’s paranoia.Perhaps the greatest contribution of ’68 was in behalf of freedom of expression. Although as president Mr. Echeverría Mr. Díaz Ordaz’s successor tried to ingratiate himself with university students through a rhetorical veering to the left the criticism he kept receiving from the newspaper Excélsior (very much in the spirit of ’68) exasperated him enough that he maneuvered a coup (in July of ’76) against its editor Julio Scherer.

1,I didn’t think much about it at the time: I was appearing in a short television segment and had quickly brushed my hair then slapped on some concealer. I figured my glasses would cover the circles under my eyes.Only later did I behold what I looked like — and it was terrifying. It wasn’t that I was disheveled; it was the actual face that looked back at me in the frozen screen shot.My mouth curled slightly downward my brows were furrowed my lips were a little pursed. My eyes aimed forward in a deadpan stare. I looked simultaneously bored mad and skeptical. I was basically saying to the newscaster: Die.In that moment I joined the ranks of a tribe of women who suffer from the scourge known as “resting bitch face” or increasingly just RBF.

8,''We're very glad to see George Washington in such good form'' said Mitsuko Suzuki of Japan who traveled to New York City with four members of her family for the festivities. Closing the CycleYesterday's ceremony capped a series of observances of the nation's founding that included the celebration of American independence in 1976 and the 1987 salute to the Constitution. And the inaugural re-enactment came after a weekend of festivities that brought a flotilla of tall ships into New York Harbor and sent fireworks flashing over lower Manhattan on Saturday. In the foggy night sky the fireworks had a washed-out look but the crowd oohed and aahed as rosettes bloomed above New York harbor and cannon-like booms echoed back and forth.After the first inauguration 200 years ago Dr. W. W. Buchanan a godson of Washington wrote that there was ''a police office and watch-house'' at Broad and Wall Streets and he watched the inauguration from there. That station house is long gone but the police were on hand yesterday. More than 4500 officers were stationed throughout lower Manhattan and most of the area was sealed off to private cars for most of the weekend.Yesterday's events began where Washington began his day 200 years ago at St. Paul's Chapel between Fulton and Vesey Streets. Two hundred years ago its steeple made it one of the tallest buildings in Manhattan; now it is dwarfed by the World Trade Center and almost everything else nearby. But inside the sanctuary with its clear glass windows and covered altar the pew that George Washington used on his inauguration day is still there.For yesterday's ''Service of Thanksgiving'' the church was filled with more than 300 dignitaries including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a Democrat of New York. He arrived as the deep ancient bells in the church tower tolled. A Hymn Is ReprisedMayor Edward I. Koch was already inside as were Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a fellow Democrat; Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato a New York Republican; Senator Frank Lautenberg a New Jersey Democrat and the actress Helen Hayes.Mr. Bush's heavily-guarded motorcade glided to a stop under a tent outside the chapel and the President and Mrs. Bush went inside where bright television lights and video cameras were nestled between the chapel's ornate white columns. There was no sermon only readings and prayers including one by the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr. the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Mr. Moore greeted the Bushes and noted that he had once worked on a ''civil rights program in Texas'' with them.

7,The flames raged almost until dawn yesterday at 558 50th Street in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. Sirens screamed firemen fought the blaze police officers held back the spectators and ambulances stood by to carry away the injured. But there was no panic and hardly any anxiety and when some fiery debris fell from the four‐story brick building there was even be a scattering of applause from the crowd. A movie was being madeThe film was “Nunzio” and it is being produced entirely in the Bay Ridge‐Borough Park sections of Brooklyn because the writer James Andronica grew up there and drew on his experiences for the story. “Nunzio” is about a retarded man in his 20's who is tormented and bullied by neighborhood youths but who emerges as a hero during a fire.Jobs for Young PeopleThat fire was being manufactured in the early hours yesterday. But it was not just a simulated fire. Under the terms of the agreement between the building's owner the Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee—a nonprofit community organization—and Universal Pictures which is financing the production the film company will pay for part of the renovation of the building and support the employment of about 40 neighborhood youths during cleanup operations.Other youths from this low‐income area are being hired as extras or production aides for the film. And many residents who at first had reservations about the filming in their neighborhood because of the disruptions and distractions now say they are delighted that the effort is also being translated into money for Bay Ridge‐Borough Park.

8,He described the still-missing item as a headdress mask of the Tlingit tribe that had been collected in Alaska's Baranof Island. The item has a value of about $150000.The recovered items were found in the A.C.A. Galleries at 25 East 73d Street by detectives from the Police Department's intelligence division. They were acting on information from a confidential source police officials said. Detectives said it had not yet been determined whether the gallery knew the artifacts had been stolen.Last June 15 when the theft was made public Dr. Roland W. Force the museum's director described the stolen objects as ''some of the finest pieces of their kind in existence.'' Stolen From Display CaseDr. Force said he first noticed on June 13 that the artifacts were missing from their display case on the second floor of the museum on Audubon Terrace at Broadway and 155th Street. But he said he had thought then that a member of the museum staff had simply moved the pieces.The director said someone had removed the frame from the display case slid the glass aside and taken five of the six pieces in the case. ''My supposition is that this was done by people who were very knowledgeable'' he said at the time. The five pieces were small enough to be concealed under clothing unlike the other item that was left behind.

0,''Not at all'' he said. ''If anything the last three made it harder. We go into Baltimore we really played well. Who gets 540 yards in the pro game? If not for a few errant plays we'd be playing this weekend and I'd still be coaching the Jets. A couple of people when I told them about the offer said 'You need to consider this; it's a great fit for you.' When that is combined with the annual offer of the duration they've made seven years guaranteed those numbers started to add up.''Groh had a four-year contract with the Jets.Now the Jets must begin the process of hiring a head coach their fourth in a span of one year. It was almost exactly one year ago on Jan. 3 2000 when Parcells stepped down to go to the front office and set off a series of events that even by the bizarre standards of Jets' coaching history were mind-bending.Parcells is expected to meet with the team owner Woody Johnson tomorrow. Johnson will undoubtedly try to persuade Parcells to become the head coach. Parcells the director of football operations may be in line to acquire even more power as the president of the team but Johnson knows that the players are clamoring for stability and would love to see Parcells back on the sideline.Minutes after he learned about Groh's departure cornerback Ray Mickens said he and players that he had spoken to were concerned about the uncertainty the team faces. Groh said he has not talked to players since he left. ''Having been around these situations before when you leave nobody wants to hear from you'' he said.But for players even seemingly mundane matters hang in the balance when a coach departs. What will the off-season workout program be like? When will the players be expected to report for minicamps? Will their assistant coaches with whom players have intense contact be the next to go? Groh said he would take only his son Mike a former Virginia player with him from the Jets staff. Mickens said Parcells was the best coach he had ever played for and he would love to have him back.But Parcells has insisted that he is done with coaching even though there are constant murmurs from others to the contrary. Parcells could feel a sense of obligation to help the Jets. His two hand-picked successors -- Bill Belichick and Groh -- have blown up spectacularly in the Jets' faces. Parcells could agree to come back simply to steady the ship for one year.One person who does not seem concerned is the offensive line coach Bill Muir. With the exception of the receivers coach Todd Haley the rest of the assistants have another year remaining on their contracts according to Muir. Unless the Jets go outside the organization for a coach who wants to clean house much of the franchise will look the same.

9,They also succeeded because they took the Knicks out of their two-man game of Ewing and Starks and forced them to play fast-paced run-the-court basketball. And New Jersey didn't let up after jumping to a 52-43 halftime lead. Only 3 Rebounds for EwingEwing had 16 points and 3 rebounds 7 points and 9 rebounds below his average. Starks who had 13 points 3 below his average had three more rebounds than Ewing.New Jersey (31-24) also played some of its best defense of the season. Only Ewing Starks and Mason who had 14 points scored in double figures for the Knicks (36-18). Charles Oakley (6) and Charles Smith (7) were invisible while Greg Anthony scored just 5 points and shot two fabulous airballs.The Knicks who were routed in Detroit on Friday shot 35.9 percent from the field. The Nets who had shot less than 40 percent during their three-game losing streak shot 44.9 percent today."In the last few games we haven't been playing well" said Ewing. "It's embarrassing. We have to keep playing hard and go back to the drawing board. We didn't execute all of us. I didn't keep Chris Dudley off the boards."Nets Coach Chuck Daly recently had a talk with Dudley and told him to be like another star he has coached: Dennis Rodman king of the rebound. "He told me to go after the boards go after it" said Dudley. No. 1 vs. No. 2This game further sweetened the rivalry between the Knicks and the Nets -- who are in first and second place respectively in the Atlantic Division -- because it demonstrated that the Nets can win. The Knicks who now lead by five and half games had easily won the teams' first two meetings this season with New York just brutalizing the Nets in the second one.

8,From a speech delivered by Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin before the Senate on April 28:My Myth of the Day is that the vast majority of our nation's nearly eight and one-half million unemployed workers are receiving unemployment compensation benefits.Losing a job is a terrible blow to an individual and his or her family. Even under the most generous unemployment compensation programs only a portion of a worker's salary is replaced by unemployment benefits.Even with these benefits the families of unemployed workers are often forced to postpone all but absolutely necessary spending and may have to go into debt. How much tougher the situation becomes if no unemployment compensation benefits are available while a worker seeks a new job.This is why we should concern ourselves with the fact that there has been an astonishing decline in the percentage of those unemployed individuals who are collecting unemployment insurance benefits.

9,A submerged object in the Southern Ocean punctured the hull of the yacht Enza New Zealand yesterday during its attempt to sail around the world in 80 days. The impact which has forced the crew to head for the nearest port has eliminated any chance for the seven-man team to claim the Jules Verne Trophy and the accompanying $1 million in prize money.The 85-foot catamaran was about 1400 miles southeast of the tip of Africa when the accident occurred. Enza's co-skippers Peter Blake of New Zealand and Robin Knox-Johnston of England reported by radio that none of their crew was hurt but that the boat was damaged too severely to continue.Another catamaran trying to win the Jules Verne Trophy the 85-foot Commodore Explorer was about 200 miles ahead of Enza yesterday and was continuing.Enza New Zealand had traveled more than 9000 miles and had averaged 14.5 knots since leaving Brest France on Jan. 31. The boat was 4.3 days ahead of schedule in its 80-day global attempt. The record time for a round-the-world voyage is 109 days.

0,Those differing perceptions of flood control help explain why Donald E. Powell federal coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding announced on Thursday that the levees in the New Orleans region that were being rebuilt would not meet the insurance standard of protecting against a 100-year flood the category that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.The announcement was in many ways a candid admission that the old ways of building flood protection no longer applied.Mr. Powell insisted that the $3.4 billion in work currently under way would make the levee system stronger than ever and prevent catastrophic failure in another storm of Hurricane Katrina's strength.But he said work to bring the levees up to the standard required by the insurance agency would require as much as $6 billion in additional spending to raise levee heights replace suspect floodwalls and take other corrective action.If FEMA cannot certify the flood-stopping power of the levees the agency's maps will have to treat them as if they are not there. In other words as if the land behind them is unprotected.That will have a significant effect on how neighborhoods will be rebuilt how high off the ground homes will have to be constructed and the cost of insurance.In the old days before Hurricane Katrina and before global warming experts assumed that New Orleans was protected by the levees that the corps had built. Since then however the emerging science of weather and climate change has led to an understanding that the world is entering a cycle of stronger and more frequent storms with higher surges and waves.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.Scientists have also discovered that the land under the New Orleans metropolitan area has subsided and that the levees are now lower than their original design height. Problems with the original design have also been found.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyFundamentally the notion of what constitutes a powerful storm has been altered."We now have a new storm of record" Mr. Hitchings said. "Katrina."The data drawn from the experience of last August changes the equation of risk he said.For all the new data however the levee system that the corps has been building is largely based on a model of a hurricane derived from data first collected in 1959. By the 70's the National Weather Service had conducted new research that suggested that definition was too weak but the corps did not alter its plans to accommodate the new data."The corps once it's locked on a track will not take input from outside groups" said Ivor van Heerden a leader of the task force investigating the levee breaches for Louisiana and a professor with the hurricane center at Louisiana State University.In a recent interview Col. Lewis F. Setliff the head of the team rebuilding levees said the corps was not like the man on the street who is free to do what he pleases and change his mind at will. "We have to have a law in Congress that tells us to do something" Colonel Setliff said.Robert G. Bea a professor of engineering at the University of California Berkeley said the problem with that lack of flexibility was that "the data is not stable." Even the repairs Professor Bea said are problematic."They're building new walls but they're building them to the old standard" he said. "But we already know the old standard is inadequate."The corps has undertaken a two-year project at the request of Congress to propose substantial upgrades for hurricane protection in southern Louisiana. A preliminary report from that project is due in June with a final report in December 2007.If the study comes up with proposals for what the people of Louisiana say they truly want protection against the strongest Category 5 storms the cost would make the additional $6 billion look like a bargain. But it would more than exceed the insurance needs Mr. Hitchings said adding "Obviously if it was Category 5 it would be much bigger than 100-year protection."D. J. Nordquist a spokeswoman for Mr. Powell said that "there's obviously a bigger question" facing New Orleans which will always have the threat of storms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story"What level of protection are people comfortable with and what are they willing to spend?" Ms. Nordquist asked. "What's even feasible?"

8,When Franklin Roosevelt nominated Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme Court in 1939 voices of the extreme right called Professor Frankfurter a Communist. They cited especially the fact that he was a member of a national committee of the American Civil Liberties Union.On Jan. 12 1939 Frankfurter himself appeared as a witness before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee: a break from the traditional practice of Supreme Court nominees. The questions begun by Senator William E. Borah Republican of Idaho focused on his association with the A.C.L.U.Frankfurter explained how the Civil Liberties Union had come into being after World War I a time of public hysteria about supposed radical plots. He had been a Federal prosecutor Frank-furter said and he knew about the dangers of power in official hands. He knew the need for ''a group of people whose special job it should be to be watchful [ of ] the Bill of Rights.''As an example of his role he said the A.C.L.U. had consulted him about whether to help the Ku Klux Klan when Boston officials tried to stop it from holding a parade. ''I said 'Of course civil liberty means liberty for those whom we do not like or even detest.' '' (He was surely paraphrasing a passage in one of his favorite opinions by Justice Holmes: ''If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought - not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.'') Senator Borah asked about the relationship of the A.C.L.U. to Communism.
7,One section of the bill whose effects were uncovered yesterday would increase in some circumstances the pensions of officials who remained in office after the age of 70. It would do this by in effect freezing the money reserves on which the pension was based when the employee became 70 rather than letting it continue to decline as was now the case.This is the section that could in theory affect Mr. Levitt and Mr. Lefkowitz if they retired and selected certain pension options. Both men denied having encouraged the measure or having any knowledge of it and said it had no relevance because they had no current plans to retire.Its primary beneficiaries according to sources would be a number of judges who routinely remain in their posts after the age of 70. Precisely how many would be affected by the change and how much such a change would cost could not be ascertained yesterday.Another section would in essence allow the New York City Conciliation and Appeals Board—the hearing officers for disputes involving the city's rent‐stablilization system — to be classified as a municipality giving its employees the right to join the state's employee‐retirement system.This provision would allow Mr. Gribetz who served on the board for four years to take that additional credit for state service which would have some effect on his eventual pension. Mr. Gribetz said yesterday that he was unaware of the measure until the time it was introduced and criticized the way it was done.“I didn't ask for it and I didn't know about it” Mr. Gribetz said. “If they want to add these people to the retirement system it ought to be done openly not within a salary bill.”He said the provision would affect about 100 people other than himself and that many of them were not currently covered by any pension plan.

9,There are logical reasons why composers are regularly honored with centenary (and multi-centenary) tributes but performers' centenaries are rarely celebrated. A composer's work after all takes on a life independent of its creator; a performer's art is personal expression. Without the performer on hand what is there?Carnegie Hall wrestled with this question on Thursday evening in a tribute to Marian Anderson who would have been 100 years old on Feb. 17. The concert was part of a larger tribute that includes an exhibition of memorabilia from her career in the hall's Rose Museum and a teachers' workshop that was held last weekend.Anderson's career had a special dimension of course: it was inextricably linked to a historical current the struggle for civil rights in the first half of this century. She was often described as a reluctant symbol and one can appreciate that: her triumphant 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial after all came after being banned from Constitution Hall. The entire episode was itself a symbol of Anderson's ability to prevail over countless other humiliations.But a powerful and lasting symbol it was and it became a leitmotif on Thursday when several of Anderson's colleagues offered both personal anecdotes and stories with a broader historical sweep between performances of works associated with her. Isaac Stern began with a celebratory overview and Rita Dove the poet spoke of Anderson's influence on her. It seemed early on as if hagiography would overwhelm music as a focus of the evening something I suspect Anderson would have regretted.

9,Taina inhabits a hip contemporary urban world that comes with eclectic music -- salsa R&B hip-hop -- and she has three best friends two black and one white. Her nemesis at school is Maritza Diaz born to a Puerto Rican father and an African-American mother and ''a character kids love to hate'' Ms. Perez-Brown said. The producer modeled it after the girl who stole her boyfriend when the was 14.In selling ''Taina'' Ms. Perez-Brown said she tailored the story to cater to the network's taste -- realistic characters with a child's point of view who delve into issues that appeal to a general audience of children. She said she pitched the show armed with well-developed characters 13 story lines (enough for a season) research from focus groups of Latino and black teenagers (their favorite show: ''Seinfeld'') and a business proposition.''I said here's an opportunity for you to make a bunch of money'' she said. ''In a way it's giving them a model for how to sell the series how to promote it. How to use the music to make records and music videos how to take advantage of subsidiary uses for this property. You can't assume they see the vision you have for the show.''While excited about the project executives of Nickelodeon which has invested about $600000 on development also want it to maintain a broad appeal. Ms. Perez-Brown and the executives said a large part of the give-and-take in the development process was how to balance accurate portrayals with the need to keep both Hispanic and non-Hispanic viewers interested. What is the right mix of references to the Latino family? How much Spanish to include? Would everyone get the jokes?''How do we keep the authenticity while keeping everybody else involved?'' Mr. Hecht said. ''There is a sweet spot.''That balancing effort was in evidence at a script reading by cast members for the pilot episode last month. A common teenager-parent issue -- when are children old enough to make their own decisions? -- was given a Hispanic spin (applicable to other ethnic groups as well) when the extended family butts in after Taina has announced that she wants to join the touring band.

9,Gertrud Michelson's ''When a Child Walks Away'' [Opinion Page June 10] evoked a sad nostalgia as I recalled a similar experience not many years after the author's.I was a little older than Gertrud back in the 40's when I ''ran away'' - about 11 years of age. And my trip took me much farther - from Philadelphia to New York.My mother was visiting her mother in New York and I became angry at my father who was home with my brother and me. I raided my bank (public transportation was very reasonable in those days!) and set off by trolley car (a natural means of transportation for an 11-year-old then) for Pennsylvania Station in Philadelphia. In looking back I wonder why I was not questioned at the ticket window; I purchased my ticket and made the trip uneventfully to New York.From there it was just a non-threatening subway ride to 96th and Central Park West and a three-block walk to my grandmother's house - where I was welcomed by a near-hysterical mother and grandmother because my father had called frantically to report my disappearance.
0,Like smoking and trans fats plastic bags are becoming the target of a continued campaign of public disdain. The anti-plastic bag movement — which has drawn the most momentum abroad in countries like Ireland and Bangladesh — is becoming more and more local.New York’s City Council has discussed mandatory recycling and there have even been faint rumblings of a plastic bag tax. An outright ban however like the one in San Francisco hasn’t gathered much momentum in New York.Now Whole Foods which has pledged to eliminate plastic bags in all 270 stores by Earth Day is selling a limited-edition GreeNYC cotton bag in 16 of its New York metropolitan region stores during the month of April at $11.99 a pop. It is the first of a series of cotton bags that will be introduced over each of the next several months by GreeNYC the PlaNYC environmental campaign which features that lopsided 1970s-era bird (what kind of bird is it again?).Plastic bags — while convenient and inexpensive (about the quarter the cost of a paper bag) — tend to hang around and end up in the remote crevices in the environment. Plastic bags also use petroleum in their production which makes them doubly non-environmental. (The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that plastic bags used in the United States each year require about 12 million barrels of oil to produce.)But the bags are doubly environmental. Not only do they reduce the demand for plastic bags for each bag sold but Whole Foods Market will also donate $1 to MillionTreesNYC a collaboration between the Department of Parks and Recreation and the New York Restoration Project an initiative to plant and care for one million new trees across the five boroughs over the next decade.Likewise Whole Foods’ other new reusable bag the FEED 100 bag designed by Lauren Bush (niece of President George W. Bush) will provide money to pay for 100 nutritious school meals for hungry children through the United Nations World Food Program (hence the FEED 100 name). The bag which retails for $29.99 will be rolled out nationwide on May 1.As for the GreeNYC bag there is a certain crunchy-granola earnestness to its design which is literally green (a green apple morphed with the symbol for infinity the letters “NYC” and the text: “Help Make NYC Greener”). So the Magritte irony of Anya Hindmarch it has not. We’re probably not going to see any “I Am Not a Plastic Bag”-type counterfeits in Chinatown or on eBay.
0,Wimbledon and St Averil have been withdrawn from Saturday's Kentucky Derby because of minor injuries reducing the field to 18 horses.Wimbledon who won the Louisiana Derby before finishing fifth in the Santa Anita Derby was scratched Friday morning after his trainer Bob Baffert discovered a knot about the size of a dime on the left front leg near a tendon.''These things sometimes may not be that bad'' said Baffert a three-time Kentucky Derby winner who will have no Derby starter for the first time since 1995. ''I don't think it's a career-ending injury but it's enough that we don't feel comfortable about taking him out there and running him this weekend.''Baffert said that he had Wimbledon jog and that he was all right.''He's not sore but I had a vet come in there and look at it and there is something going on there'' Baffert said. ''It's probably not that bad right now but if we were to go out there and run him then you can really hurt him.''

1,It was going to happen to someone and it did. Nearly everything that could go wrong in a live public broadcast television appearance went wrong for Mariah Carey in her three-song just-before-midnight performance on ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest” in Times Square. At first it was pretty standard fare: She posed framed by feathers as a glittering pop princess through a pristine apparently lip-synced “Auld Lang Syne.”But then “Emotions” started and she said as the music played her monitors weren’t working. (Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International the longtime audio company for Times Square on New Year’s Eve disputed her complaints: “There were zero technical malfunctions” he wrote in an email to The New York Times. “Every monitor and in-ear device worked perfectly.”) Beyond a handful of phrases Ms. Carey didn’t attempt to sing her lead vocals. Meanwhile both speaking and singing her voice was considerably lower huskier and scratchier than it had been during “Auld Lang Syne.”“I’m trying to be a good sport here” she said as the backing track to “Emotions” played on. “Let the audience sing” she urged and she cued one of her dancers to grab her in a lift. She kept on smiling and strutting in her high heels; she held her microphone toward the crowd. When the song ended she declared “That was” — she paused to choose a valid but positive adjective — “amazing.”Then with a skirt added to her outfit and still smiling she performed her 2005 hit “We Belong Together” at times holding the microphone far from her mouth or calling out “Happy New Year!” as the impeccable lead vocals continued: more proof of lip-syncing. “It just don’t get any better” she quipped husky-voiced again. And the segment was over.
9,The Missing 'Falsettos'The Broadway season ended this week on a slightly sour note for "Falsettos" despite the many positive reviews it received. It was the last musical to open by Wednesday the cutoff date for Tony Award eligibility but neither Channel 5's 10 P.M. news nor Channel 4's 11 P.M. news carried reviews by their respective critics Stewart Klein and Pia Lindstrom. "Falsettos" combines two one-act musicals about gay life in the early 1980's -- "March of the Falsettos" and "Falsettoland" by William Finn and James Lapine -- that were produced separately Off Broadway.So why does it matter that these two news programs looked the other way? For the Broadway theater industry locked in a constant struggle with local stations about lack of coverage it means a lot. Broadway has been lucky these last six weeks with its anomalous surplus of Hollywood stars. But without Glenn Close or Jessica Lange to tantalize local news directors Broadway shows have been increasingly ignored in the last year. "Falsettos" has no stars."It's a great disappointment to us that a major network like NBC has arbitrarily decided not to support a new American musical by refusing to review our show" say Barry and Fran Weissler the show's producers. "It is outrageous that this is a decision that not only affects our show but could affect our entire industry in the coming seasons."Ms. Lindstrom says: "We have had a policy over the last year not to cover every Broadway show. What I review is my decision in collaboration with the executive producer who will look at a list of openings and ask 'What can you eliminate here?' If a show is a revival doesn't have stars or has a limited appeal then we don't do it. As a news organization it is our right to decide what to cover."

9,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students explore the backgrounds qualifications and platforms of the current Presidential candidates for the 2000 election. Students will work in pairs or small groups to research pertinent information about assigned candidates and create official-looking résumés for their Presidential hopefuls.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Determine what an informed voter should know about all candidates prior to voting in an election.2. Examine the current trend of 2000 Presidential election candidates incorporating their character into their campaign policies by reading and discussing “Candidates Taking a Stand Mix Policy and Persona.”3. Categorize important information that one should know about Presidential candidates into headings commonly found on résumés.4. Investigate in pairs or small groups information about an assigned Presidential candidate to be included in a résumé for that candidate as determined by the class.5. Create official-looking résumés for their Presidential hopefuls including all research information conducted in the appropriate format.Resources / Materials:-student journals-paper-pens/pencils-classroom blackboard-copies of “Candidates Taking a Stand Mix Policy and Persona” (one per student)-ten slips of paper each with the name of one of the Presidential hopefuls (Gary Bauer Bill Bradley Patrick J. Buchanan George W. Bush Steve Forbes Al Gore Orrin Hatch Alan Keyes John McCain Donald Trump)-hat or bag-computers with Internet access (as many as available preferably one per every pair of students)-print resources with information on the 2000 Presidential candidates (newspapers magazines etc.)-a variety of sample résumés (copied from résumé books) for students to use as guides to résumé layout and formActivities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals students respond to the following (written on the board prior to class): How does someone make the decision of which candidate in an election for whom he or she should vote? What are the different things that you would want to know about the candidates if you were voting in the upcoming 2000 Presidential elections? (You may create a list.) Ask students to share their responses. Title a section of your blackboard “What We Want to Know” and add students’ ideas as they share them.2. As a class read and discuss “Candidates Taking a Stand Mix Policy and Persona” focusing on the following questions:a. Read the first three paragraphs. Then respond to the journalist’s questions posed in paragraph 3. What is the role of a candidate’s character when it comes to elections?b. Why might Presidential candidates be developing and presenting “more meaty 10- and 12- point plans earlier in the season than ever before in Presidential politics”? What examples are offered in the article?c. How do “the candidates’ handling of issues (reveal) their won approaches and personalities”? What examples are offered in the article? Why does personality matter in an election?d. Why according to the article do many politicians present detailed plans early in the election process particularly in this Presidential election?e. How can presenting an overly-detailed plan lead people to feel that a politician is getting “tripped up in the minutiae”? How does this relate to some of the 2000 Presidential hopefuls?f. How do political ads reflect a candidate’s character?g. What examples from recent election history are given to support the statement that “candidates have to be mindful that voters do not always take detailed policy proposals at face value”? How does this affect the race for President as supported by the article?h. How do politicians attempt “to use substance to prove their own character”?i. Do you agree with the statement that “the more candidates propose the more they overpromise”? Why or why not? What does the last paragraph leave readers feeling and thinking?3. Explain to students that they will each be working with a partner (or small group of three if class size is larger than 20) to learn about a Presidential hopeful and then to write a résumé about him as if he were applying for the job of President. Refer back to the “What We Want to Know” list and add any necessary categories that relate directly to the organization of a résumé (such as objectives special qualifications previous jobs and education). Then determine where different items on the original list could be categorized and create new résumé categories as necessary. Be sure to include a category or categories explaining the candidate’s positions on social security crime women’s issues the economy education and other important issues of the day.4. Each pair or small group draws a slip of paper from a hat or bag with the name of the Presidential hopeful whom they will be researching. Using all available classroom resources students should research the information that will need to be included in the résumé as determined on the board. It will be very helpful to students if they organize their notes into the categories determined by the class each category on a separate sheet of paper. This way their research will be organized fairly well when it is time for them to transfer the information into résumé form. The Internet will be students’ most valuable resource as there is a vast array of good accurate easy-to-find information there. Suggest that students go to a search engine such as Yahoo! (//www.yahoo.com) AltaVista (//www.altavista.com) or another favorite search engine and type in the name of their candidate. All candidates have at least one Web site devoted to their background and platforms. Students can also find excellent information in newspapers and magazines though this type of information search will probably take longer than searching through Web sites.5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: After all research is complete each pair or small group transfers their research into résumé format developing an official-looking résumé for their Presidential hopeful. Display or hand out sample résumés for students to use as visual guides for the layout and form of their résumés. Résumés should be neatly typed and checked carefully for proper grammar and spelling. In a future class each pair or small group should hand out copies of their Presidential hopeful’s résumé and present his qualifications and platform to the class for discussion. Students might also develop questions for further research on each candidate for the groups to investigate as the campaign continues.Further Questions for Discussion:–What personal qualities should every good leader possess?–How do journalists often insert their own views into the news that they relay?–What information about a candidate’s past do you think is important to know? What do you think is not important?–What different methods do Americans use to determine which political candidate to support?–What are some of the issues that are important topics of debate in recent American political history?–Why do some people choose not to vote?–What are various methods of political campaigning?–What fundamental differences exist between the Democratic and Republican party platforms?–What other political parties exist in the United States and what are their fundamental political platforms?–How do national and international events impact political elections and how people vote?–How might a voter’s gender religion ethnicity age education job and region in which they live affect how he or she votes in an election?–What responsibilities does the media have in presenting information about political candidates?–What responsibilities do political candidates have in being honest to the media?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal response participation in class discussions thorough and accurate research of a Presidential candidate’s background and platforms and thoughtfully- created résumé for this Presidential hopefulVocabulary:persona espousing substance attuned elusive pronouncements intricacies parlance geniality optimism daunting substantive implicit aura subliminal bona fides partisans accelerated minutiae ridiculed remedy mavens deflect integrityExtension Activities:1. Host a mock press conference or debate of Presidential candidates. Ask different students to represent different candidates one student to act as the moderator and the remaining students to act as the press. Each student representing the press should come prepared to the conference or the debate with a series of questions for candidates and those acting as the candidates should be confident in their knowledge of their candidate’s background and platform on different issues. Stage the conference or debate for other classes in your grade or school and then hold a mock election. Determine percentages of votes going to the different candidates and compare them with poll results as the electoral process continues. Interview voters as to how they voted and why and write a news analysis of the process and results for your school newspaper.2. Create a diagram of the electoral process in the race for the Presidency. You may want to locate and analyze a news article related to each step of the process. Additionally the New York Times Learning Network offers a crossword puzzle titled The Electoral Process (//www.nytimes.com/learning/students/xwords/november99_1.html) which incorporates election process and history into its clues.3. Choose a significant issue that surfaces in many if not all of the platforms of the 2000 Presidential election hopefuls. Create a comparison chart detailing where each candidate weighs on this issue. Then examine how each candidate supports his views and write a position paper on your opinions of these platforms.4. Develop an illustrated timeline of changes in voting law in the United States from the 19th century to today. How did different minority groups gain the right to vote and what impact has their voice had on elections? What legislation has been developed to ensure the voting rights of all citizens? What legislation now exists regarding who may run for different offices?5. Research the platforms of candidates in past Presidential elections and how these platforms reflected critical issues in the nation and the world at that time.6. Create biographies or résumés for people who withdrew their candidacy for the 2000 Presidential elections. Where did these people stand on important issues? Why did they drop out of the election?7. Examine your most recent local and/or state elections. What promises did candidates make regarding important issues on a local or state level? How are the elected candidates attempting to meet these needs? What has been the public reaction to these candidates now that they have been elected into office?8. Use The New York Times to follow the campaign of a favorite Presidential hopeful. Create a scrapbook of articles photos and related news items analyzing the successes and failures of the candidate throughout the electoral process. The New York Times on the Web’s political campaign special index (//www.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/) provides articles and columns about the upcoming elections in 2000 plus maps polls and links to campaign ads.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Locate and analyze the texts of historic speeches given by Presidential candidates. How would Americans view these candidates today?Geography- Create a series of maps of the United States that relate to opinion and official polls for the 2000 Presidential election. You may want to color-code candidates or parties to clearly see where political sympathies lie. Then examine why the people in different states may side with a particular candidate.Global History- Research election laws voting methods political parties and governments in other countries. Investigate the successes and obstacles of this year’s first democratic elections in many areas of the world such as in Indonesia.Journalism/Teaching with The Times- Explore how photographs that run in the newspaper affect one’s perception of a candidate’s character. The New York Times on the Web’s Photo Gallery: The Campaign Trail (//www.nytimes.com/library/photos/thecampaigntrail.html) offers the most recent photos of Presidential candidates with related articles. Be sure to also examine photographs from past and present elections in other countries. Create a collage of the pictures that you think best reflect the character of the candidates captured on film.Mathematics- Graph opinion and official polls of Presidential candidates throughout the electoral process. What causes fluctuations in a candidate’s popularity? Who do you predict to win as each poll is released?–Investigate and graph the campaign finances of some or all of the current Presidential hopefuls. Find the appropriate statistics on Web sites such as the Federal Election Commission (//www.fec.gov) Center For Public Integrity (//www.publicintegrity.org) Center for Responsive Politics (//www.opensecrets.org/home/index.asp) Public Disclosures Inc. (//www.tray.com) and Project Vote Smart (//www.vote-smart.org/). Include in your statistical research each candidate’s receipts (money raised) disbursements (money spent) cash on hand top contributors and how much they each have contributed business sector contribution totals and geographic totals (totals or percentages of money from different states or regions of the country). At the bottom of each graph created write a paragraph analyzing what this graph indicates about this candidate and his campaign.Media Studies- Evaluate Presidential campaign advertisements and how candidates both emphasize their views and attempt to point out what they feel are the “flaws” of their opponents. The New York Times on the Web has an extensive video collection of Presidential campaign commercials (//www.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/ads-index.html).Other Information on the Web:Policy.com Issue of the Week: Campaign 2000 (//www.policy.com/issuewk/1999/0719_84/index.html) is an exploration of the candidates issues and campaigns.Democracy Network: Presidential 2000 (//www.democracynet.org/pres2000/) includes an index of election and voter resources candidate Web sites and significant news stories.The American Presidency Online (//gi.grolier.com/presidents/) is a comprehensive site for historical information on the presidency and American politics from Grolier’s.Editorial Cartoons: Campaign 2000 (//www.cagle.com/2000/) offers editorial cartoons on the campaign for the 2000 elections from newspapers around the U.S. updated daily.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Civics Standard 9- Understands the importance of Americans sharing and supporting certain values beliefs and principles of American constitutional democracy.

9,While living in Greenwich Village and Harlem Wright produced hundreds of articles and short stories. Working for the Federal Writers Project he wrote the Harlem section for New York Panorama and contributed to "The Harlems" in the New York City Guide. His friends in the arts included Ralph Ellison (future author of "Invisible Man" and best man at Wright's wedding) Langston Hughes Countee Cullen Nelson Algren John Hammond Carson McCullers and John Steinbeck. The turning point in his career came in 1940 when Harper and Brothers published "Native Son" with its memorable violent character Bigger Thomas. It was a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and sold 215000 copies in three weeks.Because of Wright's lectures and writings against racism the F.B.I. investigated him in 1942 to determine if he could be prosecuted for sedition. Professor Rampersad notes that Wright continued to be monitored by the F.B.I. and later by the C.I.A. as well for the rest of his life. His autobiography "Black Boy" was denounced as obscene on the floor of the Senate in 1945 by Senator Theodore Bilbo a Mississippi Democrat. The book sold 195000 copies in its Harper edition and 351000 through the Book-of-the-Month Club. Living in France after World War II Wright came under the influence of the existentialists. His novel "The Outsider" appeared in 1953 but existentialism was not his forte.The reader of Professor Rampersad's notes on the text learns that the Book-of-the-Month Club requested changes in both of Wright's major works to cool down some of the sexual passages and to eliminate his political experiences. Wright wrote in his journal that pressure from American Communists led the book club to ask him to drop the second section of his autobiography which dealt with his involvement with the party in Chicago. The challenging title "American Hunger" was changed to "Black Boy."Wright acceded to the changes and made them himself -- understandably since the book club meant recognition and improved his fortunes. For black as well as white writers -- in newspapers magazines books and films -- freedom of language and subjects were nowhere near the same in the 1940's as they are in the 1990's. But even with the cuts "Native Son" was still strong medicine for white readers. It became politically correct (in today's phrase) to read it or see it performed onstage.Now all the self-censored material has been restored in both volumes of "Richard Wright." For the first time the complete text of Wright's autobiography has been brought together using the page proofs that were set before the book club's intervention. Similarly Wright's first novel "Lawd Today!" is reinstated with its kaleidoscopic experiments restored. Present-day readers will be pleasantly surprised by its stylistic passages that recall parts of John Dos Passos' "U.S.A."

1,ROME — Retaliating against a remarkable campaign from within the church to force the ouster of Pope Francis the Vatican’s former spokesman issued a statement on Sunday night questioning the credibility of an archbishop who has accused Francis of covering up sexual misconduct.But in seeking to defend the pope against the latest allegations which relate not to abuse but to the pope’s own credibility the former spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi seemed to confirm a key part of the archbishop’s claims. And the defense also offered a portrait of the pope and his top advisers as having been politically naïve.In a letter released Friday the archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò challenged the notion put forward by Vatican officials and the pope that he had ambushed Francis in 2015 by setting up a private meeting at the Vatican’s Washington embassy with Kim Davis the Kentucky county clerk who became a conservative celebrity by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Archbishop Viganò said in the letter that he had fully briefed Francis and his top advisers all of whom he named about Ms. Davis and her “conscientious objection” to promoting same-sex marriage. He received approval from them all he said.
8,IF you're a kid living in New York and you haven't been cast in a movie you're just not trying. Even pictures that aren't shooting in the city have dispatched operatives to wander through schools public and private searching for talent. Take the director Moshe Mizrahi (who made the Academy Award-winning ''Madame Rosa'') for instance. He begins filming ''The Children's War'' in Budapest this week and he chose New York teen-agers five boys and two girls to be his leading players. The screenplay by Abby Mann based on ''The Survivor'' an autobiographical book by Jack Eisner is about children of the Warsaw ghetto who rose against the Nazis in 1943 and Mr. Mizrahi wanted the cast to come from one place so moviegoers wouldn't be jarred by a variety of accents. ''They have to speak the same music'' he says.Mr. Mizrahi lives in Israel though he began his directing career in France and he's very impressed by New York's youngest. ''They are talented and bright'' he says. ''They have no illusions no bitterness. They're not trying to settle accounts with anybody.''Mr. Mizrahi works well with children and one of his most personal films ''I Love You Rosa'' about a little boy and an older woman was based on the life of his great-grandmother.''She lived to be 107'' he says. ''When she was 21 her husband died and the Jewish law said she had to marry her brother-in-law. He was 11 years old. She had to wait until he reached the age of reason so he could decide either to marry her or to give her her freedom. That woman decided she would take that child raise him fashion him to be her husband and she just did that. When he was 15 he married her and they had 10 kids. I identified with that story especially when I was sliding into adolescence. I thought it would be marvelous if a woman would take me and teach me.''

9,APOLOGY or no apology Mike Tyson ought to receive not a cent for his fight Saturday in Las Vegas Nev. against Evander Holyfield the heavyweight championship bout that some people have mistakenly likened to the Roberto Duran ''no mas'' bout. This was more Shakespearean as when Marc Antony asks ''Lend me your ears.'' But Tyson is not one to ask for anything. He takes. Ask Desiree Washington whose rape accusation eventually sent Tyson to prison for three years.In a live televised statement yesterday Tyson said that he had ''snapped'' when he bit Holyfield's ears and drew a disqualification. ''It was the worst night of my professional career'' he said and added ''I apologize'' to the world his family the Nevada State Athletic Commission among others.He said he did what other athletes have done and has ''paid the price.'' And he mentioned for one the ballplayer who spit into the face of an umpire. But no one in memory has chewed off part of an opponent's ear.Officials of the Nevada State Athletic Commission will today make a recommendation on whether to suspend Tyson or give him a life sentence from boxing in their state as well as whether to fine him. Tyson in effect was seeking leniency in his apology. And because he has shown remorse leniency should be considered.
9,For all the talk about the poor performance outside the conference by the members of the Big East competition within it has never been more ferocious. Some call it parity. Others say that everyone has dropped to the same level of mediocrity.In any event the competition is even free flowing and yes exciting.Last Wednesday Georgetown played suffocating defense and shot uncharacteristically well from 3-point range for a 73-62 upset over Seton Hall then the conference leader.A day earlier Boston College which hasn't had a 20-victory season since 1985 upset St. John's 71-61 to make its conference record 5-3.On Saturday the surging Eagles then surprised Georgetown before a delirious home crowd at the Conte Center. Bill Curley in leading his team past Georgetown established himself as one of perhaps the most dominating power forwards in the Big East.

8,To the Editor:Your Aug. 16 news article on Spandau Prison accompanying the obituary of Rudolf Hess refers to Hermann Goring at Nuremberg as a field marshal. While it is true that Goring once held this rank after the fall of France when Hitler rewarded his victorious generals with marshals' batons the corpulent head of the Luftwaffe received the unique title of Reich Marshal. Thus the man who said ''whenever I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver'' is the highest-ranking German military officer to date. TOM MOORE Madison Wis. Aug. 18 1987

9,"There's plenty of cash on the sidelines" he added "and it will be supporting the market on any pullback."Commenting on program trading where market professionals make a profit on small price differentials between say futures contracts on the S.&P. 500 index and on the stocks themselves Mr. Birinyi maintained that the practice had "a markedly negative impact and accelerated some of the downtrends considerably more than it helped on the up side."The market in 1990 he said was up 52 percent of the time. "The obvious reason we ended with a down year" he added "was that the bad days had greater declines than the good days" had gains. He said that program trading averaged about 20 percent of the volume during 1990 -- "well over an hour a day on average." Downtrend Was Accelerated"During this period" he added "the market fell more than 800 points. But that's not to suggest that program trading was the primary cause. But in many cases program trading accelerated the downtrend without causing it. There's a very definite strong relationship but there are too many facets to the stock market to blame or credit just one."Figures supplied by S.&P. on the best and worst performing stock groups through Thursday show that health-care stocks rose 58.3 percent soft drinks 22.1 percent and tobacco 20.8 percent. Diversified health-care stocks rose 17.2 percent household products 15 percent medical products 14.7 percent cosmetics 13.1 percent and drugs 11.2 percent.Hotel stocks fell 62.7 percent leisure stocks 45.8 percent machine tools 42.1 percent and long-distance telecommunications 38.1 percent. Worst Since 1981Both the Dow and the S.&P. 500 turned in their worst performance since 1981 when the blue-chip average slid 9.2 percent and the 500 lost 9.7 percent. The S.&P. has advanced every year since then but the Dow fell 3.8 percent in 1984 the last time it was in negative territory for a year.
0,It is one of the most arresting images ever made by a war photographer. A soldier is carried on a stretcher toward medical personnel who are calmly preparing to attend to his injuries. But the operating table the gowned and masked nurses and surgeon the stretcher carrier are all standing in water and the operating room is enclosed in a mosquito-netting tent in the middle of a mangrove swamp. A nurse draws aside the flap of the tent whose fluttery lines complement the delicate hanging tendrils and other vegetation. Natural light illuminates the table and hits the swirls of water around the approaching medic.In haunting unreality and beauty this picture surpasses Robert Capa's 1943 image of British surgeons working shirtless in a church in Sicily. Unlike Capa who is internationally famous Vo Anh Khanh is not much known even in his own country Vietnam. He took the picture in 1970 in a Vietcong haven in the southern Mekong Delta didn't think much of it and never printed it.His image is one of more than 100 black-and-white photographs in ''Another Vietnam: Pictures of the War From the Other Side'' at the International Center of Photography. The exhibition a collaboration with the National Geographic Society offers a rare comprehensive look at how Vietnamese photographers who found common cause with the Communists recorded the conflict.Mr. Khanh now in his early 60's was one of 30 surviving war photographers whom Doug Niven the show's curator tracked down during more than 20 trips to Vietnam. An American news photographer he began his search after he went to Cambodia in the early 1990's and saw handmade black-and-white postcards of the war.
8,As a vegetarian I was deeply disturbed and offended by Priscilla Feral's remarks about animal issues in general and Friends of Animals policy in particular [ ''Connecticut Q&A'' Oct. 11 ] .On the one hand she claimed to be a vegetarian. But then she admitted that she eats ''a little fish.'' I don't know how little a fish has to be before it stops being an animal. But it sure isn't a vegetable no matter how small it gets.Ms. Feral went on to say that she'd become a full-fledged vegetarian if only she were single ''and free to be that selfish.''What in the world is she talking about? If vegetarianism especially the ethical kind is anything it's unselfish. That's the whole point of it. A person chooses not to eat meat for the sake of animals not because of his or her own appetite.

8,The Knicks who usually win games at home in the fourth quarter found a way to lose one last night shooting 23 percent from the field.While Knicks were missing 20 of 26 shots in the last period the Golden State Warriors were shooting 70 percent and outscored the Knicks 134-114 at Madison Square Garden before a capacity crowd of 19591.The loss was the Knicks' third in the last six games at the Garden since the Philadelphia 76ers halted their home winning streak at 26 games. The defeat also was the Knicks' worst at home since April 17 1987 when the Bullets beat them 142-110. Wilkins Ties MarkThe only good news for the Knicks was Gerald Wilkins who made six 3-point field goals tying Trent Tucker's club record set last November against the Pistons. The Knicks attempted 29 3-pointers the second most in National Basketball Assocation history and hit 11 equaling a club mark.

0,How do you raise money when your institution has been made much poorer by an ongoing sex scandal — like say the Catholic Church? You sell off your valuable but obsolete property.And whom do you sell it to? Well to people you really like. And maybe at a bargain price.The National Catholic Reporter is running a cover story on the sale of church property to the Follieri Group an investment concern with purported ties to the Vatican.“They don’t want to compete” said a real estate professional who dealt with the firm on a multiple-property offering in a Midwestern archdiocese. In this case said the professional the Follieri Group attempted to short-circuit the established procedures by ignoring the brokers hired by the diocese and making its offer directly to the church for the multiple properties.The accompanying editorial calls for accountability when it comes to the church’s business practices.Bonus: There’s a celebrity angle heating up this tale.Thanks to his relationship with burgeoning Hollywood star Anne Hathaway (the princess of “The Princess Diaries” and most recently Lureen in “Brokeback Mountain”) Raffaello Follieri is more likely to be featured in New York’s tabloid newspaper gossip pages or paparazzi-like Web sites than on the financial pages.— JOYCE COHEN

7,ISLAMABAD Pakistan. July 2 (AP)—Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and opposition party negotiators agreed today on a plan for new elections designed to quell four months of political unrest.Spokesmen for the two sides said that the agreement now must be approved by the central council of the opposition Pakistan National Alliance but that a formal version could be signed within two days.The agreement is intended to end the upheaval that began after the March 7 national elections when the alliance charged that Mr. Bhutto's ruling Pakistan People's party had rigged the voting. More than 300 people died in anti‐Govornment rioting after the election and major cities were placed under martial law.The alliance negotiator Ghafoor Ahmed said that a formal version of the pact if approved by the central council would be signed by Mr. Bhutto and the alliance leader Maulana Mufti Mahmood. [Alliance leaders met Saturday night to discuss the plan and probably will continue their talks Sunday Reuters quoted Maulana Mahmood as having said.]

8,To the Editor:It is difficult to understand why the basis of our protests against United States Surgical Corporation is consistently misreported (news story March 3). The company operates on live dogs in hundreds of sales demonstrations to promote use of its surgical staplers to doctors. Board-certified surgeons are trained in all wound-closure methods. United States Surgical is not a medical school; it is a commercial enterprise that kills dogs to make sales. That has nothing to do with surgical training. It has everything to do with animal abuse.More to the point would be a report on our efforts and legal actions to have the company's Connecticut lab license revoked so that this vivisection for profit can be stopped. The case is now on appeal and the truth may soon be recognized as expert opinion is brought to bear.Yes there are larger issues involved but none larger than the cutting up and killing of dogs for corporate profits.

0,To others he represents the only hope for peace and independence for his fragile fledgling country. Despite the flawed administration of the Palestinian Authority and the divisions among Palestinians no alternative has emerged.There was no mistaking where the crowd of 2000 or so stood tonight. They cheered wildly and chanted as Mr. Arafat held the torch aloft. Nisreen Turki 7 waved a Palestinian flag and clutched her father's hand as she strained for a glimpse of the legendary leader.Almost as quickly as he had arrived Mr. Arafat was gone. After less than three minutes and without a word to the faithful he was whisked from the stage and hustled to a waiting car.But Mr. Arafat seemed reluctant to leave the adoration behind. He stopped and thrust his fingers in the air in the shape of a V to the delight of the crowd before disappearing into a black Mercedes with bulletproof glass.A few minutes later Mr. Arafat's New Year's message was broadcast on Palestinian radio and television. It was a mixture of defiance and moderation a call for peace and for firmness in a time of violence. ''The Palestinian people who choose peace as a strategic choice stand today on solid ground'' he said. ''They will not be weakened and will not be humiliated and their rights will not be wasted as long as we have blood pulsing through our veins.''Mr. Arafat's mother-in-law Rimonda Taweel was standing with three friends not far from the stage after Mr. Arafat's departure today. They had been arguing about the prospects for peace but they agreed that there was no chance without Mr. Arafat.''If Arafat fails you will never find anybody with the authority to sign the peace treaty'' said Madhat Awartami a businessman in a leather jacket.

0,In fact at a recent holiday party soon after the renovation Ms. Gund ushered in guests to see not the reborn kitchen but a video playing a continuous loop. The work ''Dicing Nature'' opens with a scene of the empty kitchen with a vase of flowers in one corner. Then Mr. Shapiro's nephew Bryan Calvert a chef who owns Cafe Atlas on Central Park South appears and slices up a grapefruit. In the next scene a waterfall gushes from a ceiling vent gradually filling the room with water. A couple of fish swim by. ''It's about the displacement of nature the interaction between the use of food and nature and our perception of nature'' Mr. Dochantschi said taking a stab at clarifying the plot.At the party for the Museum of Modern Art's membership committee guests were riveted especially by a vase of purple and white orchids on a bookshelf captured by a discreetly placed camera and inserted into the video. ''You can't tell what's real and what's been filmed before'' said Neal Meltzer an art consultant while watching a scene showing the Cornue stove and the flowers dissolving into clouds in a blue sky. ''It's a little like a Magritte.'' As the party wound down guests began turning the camera on themselves so that they too appeared in the video as the kitchen flooded.Considering that people are spending more and more time in the kitchen it was probably inevitable that art would find its way there as well said Glenn D. Lowry director of the Museum of Modern Art. The idea that it could be ''not just a place to cook and chat over a meal but actually a place for thinking about art was brilliant'' he said.It took three months to make the video -- almost as long as the renovation -- using software by Peter Flaherty a video artist who worked on ''Alladeen'' a mixed-media presentation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last month. The jazziest aspect of the Gund-Shapiro video is the projection of a live image -- at the party it was the orchids -- into the recorded clip. As it turned out buying fish at the fish market in Chinatown and keeping them alive was almost as difficult.The 20-minute video was included in the budget for the project. (Mr. Dochantschi and his clients declined to discuss how much was spent except to say that it was about the same as for an off-the-shelf kitchen from a high-end European company.) Ms. Gund said that at first she was skeptical about the video ''but when Markus explained it better as being about the difference between what you think you're eating and what you really eat I thought it was such a fun idea.'' The flat-screen monitor positioned next to the table also serves as a computer a DVD player and a television set.The Gund-Shapiro kitchen is Mr. Dochantschi's first. The only other project he has completed in the United States is the renovation of a town house in Greenwich Village for Hyatt Bass a daughter of Sid and Anne Bass and her husband Josh Klausner. He approached the 400-square-foot kitchen with the intensity of a young architect with ideas to burn and much to prove. Today's kitchen is highly complex and layered he said like a Joseph Cornell box.''It has to work on contradictory levels'' he said ''as a professional space for entertaining a normal home kitchen and an extension of the living room.''
0,When I was growing up my aunt and uncle would occasionally leave Manhattan to visit us in our leafy suburb but to our bewilderment they would seldom spend the night. ''All this peace and quiet makes me nervous'' my uncle would mutter before hurrying back to the perpetual hum of the city.Getting away from it all -- sounds nice doesn't it? But once you scratch the surface of that alluring phrase what's underneath? It all depends on what you're getting away from.For those stressed-out overachievers whose status is measured by the number of hours they spend at work it might mean repairing to a remote island for two weeks to do nothing but lie on the beach and read books. On second thought overachievers can seldom relax; they'd rather turn holidays into a competitive sport. In which case they'd probably be happier hiking around an island where a series of eco-tourism resorts offers a bracing days-long trek between lodges that incorporate self-sustaining energy technology into elegant (but appropriately spartan) modern architecture. Or as they say in the movies no (or almost no) unspoiled lands were harmed in the making of this vacation.For those of us who are less geographically ambitious maybe a two-hour drive to a little cottage at the beach is all we need. One man's getaway lovingly perfected over the course of a decade is far from palatial but makes up in sheer charm and comfort what it lacks in square footage. A legendary Modernist architect took the less-is-more concept even further building himself a minuscule but perfectly organized log cabin overlooking the sea. What if you don't even want to leave your backyard in order to escape? There's a man who can design and build a folly or you -- a rustic dining pavilion or a tiny screened sleeping hut that offers all the romance of camping out minus the pesky mosquitoes and you don't even have to gas up the car.
4,I have just sent a letter to Mayor La Guardia concerning the danger which inheres in the regular sounding of sirens at noon on Saturdays. It is my contention that if Hitler or Hirohito were planning an air raid they could catch the entire city unawares and with its entire defense set-up down by merely scheduling it for Saturday at noon when the sirens mean nothing but a weekly exercise.

1,HOUSTON – Tracy Stevens the wife of Butler Coach Brad Stevens summed up a second straight Final Four trip this way: “Insanity.”That is not just because her 34-year-old husband has already won as many N.C.A.A. tournament games 10 in the past four seasons as Bob Knight did in his final 15 seasons coaching at Indiana and Texas Tech. She described the Final Four as insanity because of her traveling party: eight children under the age of 6.The Butler coaches have a combined nine children though only eight could make the trip to Houston. The Stevenses have two children: Brady 5 and Kinsley who is 22 months old.Tracy Stevens has traveled with a large group for most of the past three weeks. First the gang went to Washington then it moved on to New Orleans and now it has arrived in Houston.Tracy Stevens who formerly worked as a labor and employment lawyer has tried to persuade the children to enjoy the trips to take in the sights. It was easier said than done.While the Bulldogs practiced here the children ran around jumped near and climbed on the raised court at Reliant Stadium. The wives and others tired themselves out chasing after them. Insanity indeed.“But I’m not ready for it to end” Tracy Stevens said.

1,PhotoJeb Bush appeared to modify his public comments about Indiana’s “religious freedom” law on Wednesday in a closed-door Silicon Valley fund-raiser telling a small group of potential supporters that a “consensus-oriented” approach would have been better at the outset.Mr. Bush’s comments were strikingly different in tone and in scope from what he said on Monday night in an interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. In that interview he praised Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana for doing the “right thing” and said that the new law was similar to one in Florida and to a law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.Mr. Bush the former governor of Florida who has all but declared his candidacy for the presidency told Mr. Hewitt that if people “actually got briefed on the law” then they “wouldn’t be blasting” it. The law he said “is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs” and “to be people of conscience.” He continued “I just think once the facts are established people aren’t going to see this as discriminatory at all.”Mr. Pence after a storm of controversy in the news media and from business leaders has pushed for a “fix” to the measure he signed last week. He said the change would provide some protection against denial of service to gays and lesbians.Mr. Pence did not make his plans for a fix certain until Tuesday but Mr. Bush an aide said was aware it was under consideration when he went on Mr. Hewitt’s show.Mr. Pence told the Indianapolis Star on Sunday that he would back a change to the law.An audiotape of Mr. Bush’s remarks in California were provided to The New York Times by his aides after donors had characterized what he said.At the Four Seasons in East Palo Alto Mr. Bush was asked by an attendee to clarify his position. He said that he supported protecting religious freedom and that it must be done specifically in each state.“By the end of the week I think Indiana will be in the right place which is to say that we need in a big diverse country like America we need to have space for people to act on their conscience that it is a constitutional right that religious freedom is a core value of our country “ Mr. Bush said.But “we shouldn’t discriminate based on sexual orientation” he said.He continued “So what the State of Indiana is going to end up doing is probably get to that place.”He stressed at the fund-raiser that he wasn’t criticizing Mr. Pence but he said that the “better approach” would have been “consensus-oriented” like the effort in red-state Utah where gay rights advocates and the Mormon Church negotiated the particulars of an antidiscrimination bill.“They figured it out and they passed a law” Mr. Bush said. “And there wasn’t a bunch of you know yelling and screaming. That to me seems like a better approach to dealing with this.”“But I do fear that certain freedoms” he continued that “have historically been part of our DNA as a country now are being challenged and I don’t think it’s appropriate.”Some of Mr. Bush’s remarks were similar to what he has said about the Indiana law in recent days including voicing support for a florist in Washington State who is being sued for refusing to participate in a same-sex wedding.After the event Bill Draper former president of the Export-Import Bank and a prominent venture capitalist said that although he is enthusiastically supporting Mr. Bush he wasn’t entirely clear where Mr. Bush stood on the Indiana law.“I don’t know what Jeb feels” he said.“In Silicon Valley we are very liberal on the issues of gays and women’s rights and we’re all sensitive to the apparent wording of the law” Mr. Draper said.“Now as Jeb said the Indiana governor is trying to get it fixed” he added.

8,President Reagan has decided to sell more than $300 million worth of missiles to Saudi Arabia despite the strong possibility that the sale will be blocked by Israeli supporters in Congress a senior White House official said today.The official said the Saudis were concerned about recent successes by Iran in its war with Iraq because Iranian troops had moved close to Kuwait and the Persian Gulf oilfields.''We're going to ask the Congress for it'' the official said of the sale ''on the grounds that the Saudis think they need it. They feel threatened right now with Iran seemingly pushing Iraq back and seizing Iraq territory. They are getting very close to Kuwait and you know from Kuwait to the oilfields doesn't take that much time.''The official said the arms package included advanced models of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the shoulder-held Stinger antiaircraft missile. Harpoon anti-ship missiles may also be included. The exact number of missiles was still being worked on State Department officials said but are said to include as many as 1700 Sidewinders 800 Stingers and 100 Harpoon missiles. May Go to Congress Next Week

0,Trina Clark aka Thunda West Palm Beach Fla. Nov. 5 2000''That's my working corner the corner where you can catch me. I see what's coming from both directions and if the law enforcement's coming. If I don't want a date to know that I'm male I stand in the shade. I consider myself a real woman but I'm not. I am a hustler.''I know what I have to get out of people to get what I need.That night it was a so-so night. If I make $30 or better on my first date my luck will be good all night and my first date was $100 and something. I think I had eight or nine dates that night. A good night is 40 or better. I catch dates. I'm the one throwing the rod out there to pull in fish. I can get lucky. It can happen every day.''When I'm out there I have to think about where I'm going to get a decent meal trying to get a place to stay where I am going to get a hot shower. (Taking a bath with a water hose isn't cutting it.) All that runs through my head. I don't ever think negative. I think positive. I get into a good mood -- not thinking that I'm all that but just a good mood. Talking to myself and singing or making up songs in my head. My feet were hurting but I'm not a quitter. I don't put myself down and say I'm not going to make enough tonight.''I need a place to stay. I've been homeless. My mother told me the streets are not like home. She was right. It's hard and it's rough and you've got to know how to play the game. But I'm the original -- Thunda. I can't be anyone else and nobody can be like me.'' interview by Catherine Saint Louis

Lately it has morphed into “Silicon Sentier”: a petri dish of entrepreneurial innovation that includes a tech incubator in an old factory as well as a digital arts center and bars where tech workers gather for custom cocktails.

1,PhotoTUESDAY PUZZLE — Look! Up in the SKY! It’s a FLOCK OF BIRDS! It’s a PLANE! It’s Paul MOLITOR whom I did not know before today’s puzzle by Peter A. Collins. But apparently Mr. MOLITOR can fly because he’s up there above the HORIZON.Today we have a crossword with a visual element which is the HORIZON stretching across the middle of our grid and the “blue expanse” SKY and the “blue expanse” SEA above and below. Some of the contents of the SKY and the SEA can be seen in their appropriate places in the grid. (We won’t talk about the placement of Amelia EARHART at 41 Down. Mr. Collins explains that in his notes below.)Two theme entries that are relatively common phrases — FLOCK OF BIRDS and SCHOOL OF FISH — make their New York Times debuts today a fact that surprised me. Wouldn’t you think they would have appeared at least once in this crossword? When I first solved the puzzle I felt like I had seen this theme before but Mr. Collins’s take on it seems to be unique.Mr. Collins talks about the nontheme fill in his notes below and I agree with him that there seems to have been quite a few three-letter words in addition to less desirable fill and abbreviation. Still I appreciated the CHEX Mix offering and the fact that it was above the HORIZON because who likes soggy snacks?Let’s hear from our constructor:Constructor’s Notes:Into which category does the theme of this one fall? There is no wordplay in the usual crossword sense – it’s the location of the themed entries that gives them relevance. Is there a name for this kind of puzzle? The theme has quite a lot of three-letter answers (25) which was necessitated to a large extent by HORIZON and its neighboring black squares in the center of the grid (forming a visual “horizon” I hope). Will and Joel asked me to rework the grid to try to lower the three-letter word count which I did. However in the end they thought the fill in this original version was significantly superior — enough to counterbalance the short-answer overload. When first constructing the puzzle I tried to include additional themed material — CLOUD and SHARK in the top and bottom rows where BRAWL and RATTY are — but that’s when the fill really started to groan. I’m happy to introduce NO CUTS today. I don’t know about you but the phrase always immediately transports me back to waiting in the lunch line at my junior high. Ahh I can practically feel the wedgies and the noogies … And honestly I didn’t intend for poor Amelia EARHART to end up nose-down in the SEA. In fact it didn’t dawn on me until well after I’d finished constructing the puzzle. Yikes! But I decided to leave her there. What? Too soon? At least she took a HIPSTER down with her.One of the things I love about the Internet — there’s a lot to feel ambivalent about — is the fact that we can experience things outside our own backyards and before our time. Let’s move on to our Wednesday puzzle with some Edith Piaf in a live performance from 1954:Your thoughts?

9,To the Editor: Apropos of ''A Free Museum Is Harder to Find'' (Dec. 28) my wife and I have known that United States citizens are not eligible for Italy's free entry for over-65's since we first encountered the policy in 1988. However we have occasionally gotten the reduction mostly by keeping our mouths shut or sometimes by muttering ''vecchio'' (''aged'') or ''I speak English'' (British subjects get the discount).On reading Betsy Wade's article I thought immediately of the time we visited the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. The young woman behind the desk could see us coming and I could see her reach for a pad of ''old folks'' tickets and get ready to stamp them before we reached the desk. She stamped one and had her hand raised to stamp the second when my wife said (in rather too-loud Brooklyn English) ''How did she know we're old?'' The hand paused a scowl appeared a combination sigh-hiss emerged and the stamp banged down on the second pass. We rapidly fled to the interior.Actually as noted in the article the free-entry rule applies only to Italian state museums. Others set their own rules. Probably the strangest was at the Museo Barracco di Scultura Antica in Rome. There we had to show our passports sign affidavits and write an entry in a log book before being granted free admission as senior citizens.ALAN STEWARTBath Me.

1,BERNATSCHKE--Wynne Miller died peacefully on June 22nd in NYC. She was the niece of Glen Miller and an accomplished singer. She was also the devoted wife of the late Rudolf A. Bernatschke a portrait artist. Wynne was a member of the Pen and Brush and the Friars clubs in New York. In lieu of flowers contributions may be sent to The Heritage Foundation 214 Massachusetts Ave. NW. Washington D.C. 20002.
9,His contribution is a plywood cut-out figure of a striding man who represents the Janus face of the art world. The figure ''Artist/Collector'' is double-sided. The collector side is a man in a suit with a determined look on his face. He holds a painting under his arm and between his fingers is a fat cigar that emits plastic-foam puffs of smoke. On the flip side the smiling artist who holds a suitcase is wearing a breezy striped shirt like the ones Picasso made his trademark. The composite figure consists of several pieces hinged together so that it can easily come apart and be stored in the case.The work by Mr. Morosan who lives in Manhattan but has a studio in Jersey City is the meditative opposite of Mr. Barrell's. ''Dogs Don't Watch TV'' is a partly open case lined with shredded paper and among the contents are a white shirt and a cap bearing the likeness of a large dog of undeterminable breed. But the work's focus is several framed drawings of the dog pondering various pieces of modern art. In one of the best the dog stares at an abstract sculpture that looks very much like his own pointy ears. The actual abstract sculpture in the show was shipped from Detroit by Bob Sestok. It's a trunk standing open and on end with several red panels bolted onto it; the resulting sculpture suggests a cardboard box with all its flaps out.Karen Shaw from Islip Long Island and Nancy Cohen from Jersey City have fashioned pieces whose contents stretch far beyond the limits of their suitcases. Ms. Shaw's study in circularity ''The Great Escape'' uses a hatbox equipped with wheels from a skateboard. Emerging from the box are two springlike forms: one is large and covered with gold foil; nesting in its coils is a more slender spring reminiscent of a Slinky toy. The springs extend to a distant wall of the gallery and the spot where they end is covered by a large wide-brimmed straw hat. If Ms. Shaw projects insouciance Ms. Cohen turns nostalgic with ''Trousseau.'' Her overnight case is from her grandmother's attic and out of it comes a long necklace that ascends to the ceiling.Kurt Novak who lives in Manhattan travels to other dimensions with his daft but appealing ''Transmigration of Souls.'' From his suitcase lined with red satin shoot out several Mason jars strung on taut lengths of twine.

0,To the Editor:An April 24 news article notes that growth in income inequality over the last several decades was particularly pronounced in New York State.The 1990's were a boom time for the state on average but the prosperity was not broadly shared and New York's income gaps continued to grow.These findings should serve as a wake-up call for New York policy makers. Religious labor civic government and business leaders should convene a series of summit meetings to address both the causes and the consequences of this situation and to develop a strategic plan for reducing child poverty increasing job opportunities and ensuring that the incomes of working families do not continue to deteriorate.TRUDI RENWICKLatham N.Y.

9,To the Editor:Apropos the recurring confusion generated by the Lincoln's Birthday and Washington's Birthday holidays: Let's add to it. On George Washington's birth certificate it says that he was born on Feb. 11 1731. In the textbooks it says that he was born Feb. 22 1732. Which side is correct? Both as usual.When Julius Caesar developed his calendar his solar calculations were off by 11 minutes and 14 seconds a year. It added up over time. When Pope Gregory XIII developed his calendar in 1582 the disparity had reached 10 days. Gregory decreed that Oct. 4 1582 should be called Oct. 15.England and its colonies finally adopted the Gregorian calendar on Sept. 2 1752 decreeing the next day should be Sept. 14 thus bridging the 11-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Thus too George Washington's birth date was transposed from Feb. 11 1731 (called Old Style) to Feb. 22 1732 (New Style). The British act also fixed the start of the new year at Jan. 1.Since the calendar was changed in September moving January and February to the beginning of the year Washington did not have a birthday in 1731. He skipped a year and thus became 11 days older and one year younger. JOHN M. CULKIN New York Feb. 22 1991
8,New Cardin BeachheadThe largely untapped Chinese market is the target of a new venture linking Pierre Cardin the French designer and Gruppo GFT an Italian manufacturer and distributor of ready-to-wear. The plan is to manufacture and to sell in China Mr. Cardin's clothing and accessories for men women and children his home furnishings and his leather goods.Mr. Cardin's name is already known in China. He showed his haute-couture collection there in 1979 and opened Maxim's restaurant in Beijing in 1983. He has also manufactured some apparel there as has Gruppo GFT.But just how much of a market for high fashion does China represent? ''The Chinese people like to dress'' Mr. Cardin said by telephone from his Paris office. ''They have rejected the Mao suits. They don't like classique. They like high fashion. The clothes we will sell there will be the same as what I show in Paris. We are expecting to open 40000 stores in China. It's a very big deal.'' Spring Hats Sprout''This is a hat season'' said Patricia Underwood a millinery designer. ''We're making them as fast as we possibly can. What we've shipped for spring is selling and we're already getting reorders.''

9,To the Editor:''Inevitable Surgery on Medicare'' (editorial June 26) holds that Medicare will be rescued by changing the eligibility age and increasing contributions by the wealthy. Absolutely but not according to plans crafted by the Senate.Medicare's eligibility age should be lowered to 0 at once solving the problem of the uninsured and ending profiteering in the health sector. And yes the wealthy should pay more -- not at the point of service or premium but through a more equitable income tax system. Medicare's popularity calls for its extension not its disappearance.ANNE-EMANUELLE BIRNNew York June 26 1997The writer is an assistant professor of health policy and history New School for Social Research.

0,Are those flower-power taxis an advertisement for a new Austin Powers movie or a protest against Iraq? Neither no matter what stories city residents and taxi drivers are making up about it. As City Room reported in September it’s a children’s art project Garden in Transit.Today to counter misconceptions about the project the group responsible Portraits of Hope is dispatching schoolchildren to hand out 80000 “sustainable” flowers around the city — one for each flower painted on taxis as part of Garden in Transit. (The fresh flowers were donated by the Veriflora sustainability program.)Thousands of children from 25 schools are participating in the giveaway in all five boroughs not only in their neighborhoods but perhaps most noticeably in Manhattan along Broadway from Harlem to the Financial District.The group said it wanted to raise awareness that the painted flowers on the taxis are actually a community art project done by volunteers and children including sick and disabled children from hospitals.According to the group there are a lot of rumors circulating about the flowers both among the public and the taxi drivers. They say that the top three people or groups that the public believes painted the flowers are:One artist aloneKids in Africa (Most commonly Darfur)The Taxi and Limousine CommissionAnd the top 10-plus wrong reasons given for the flowers:Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s birthday celebrationAn ad campaign for 1) the Whitney Museum exhibition 2) a new Austin Powers movie 3) a new investment fund aimed at baby boomersTo identify cars with G.P.S.To protest G.P.S.For non-hybrid vehiclesRaising money for something somehow related to the 1960sA protest against the war in IraqA political campaign for 1) Hillary Rodham Clinton 2) Rudolph W. Giuliani 3) Michael R. BloombergA religious celebration that is 1) Jewish 2) Muslim or 3) Christian (in that order)Because Upper East Side residents wanted something new to see from their high-rise apartments (this has been hypothesized more than once they promise)City Room rules-obsessed as always asked what kind of permissions were needed for the flower giveaway that will turn the city into a living floral arrangement today.It turns out no permit is required if the groups of children are limited to fewer than 50 the definition of a “parade” by police standards. Then again busting schoolchildren for giving away free flowers would be a bit draconian.

8,When describing events not recorded by cameras television news reports often use artists' sketches a technique that Miss Rossen discarded because ''it is boring and confusing. We opted to try something new.'' The 1988 OlympicsThe 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul South Korea may seem remote but not to executives at the three television networks who are already maneuvering for position in next year's negotiations for the rights to televise the games here. This week NBC-TV and its parent corporation RCA have a delegation of more than a dozen top officials in Seoul to meet with Korean broadcasters and members of that country's Olympic organizing committee.''The bidding for television rights is not beginning'' said Robert Mulholland president of NBC who is heading the delegation ''But this is the beginning of the process that will ultimately culminate in the bidding.'' Both ABC-TV and CBS-TV have begun informal discussions as well. Elton Rule president of ABC visited Korean broadcasters early in the summer and in July Roone Arledge president of ABC News and Sports met with members of the Korean organizing committee in London. CBS also recently sent several officials to visit Seoul.The delegation from NBC is by far the largest. It contains Richard Holbrooke formerly an assistant secretary of state in the Carter Administration who has been hired by NBC as a consultant. ''He is an expert in Asia'' Mr. Mulholland explained.Officials at all three networks expect the television rights to be awarded by the Korean committee next year and they anticipate that the price tag will be at least double the $225 million paid by ABC for the 1984 games in Los Angeles. Despite the high costs the networks are as eager as ever for the revenues that Olympics coverage generates. ABC plans to sell more than $650 million in advertising for the 1984 games. News ControversyTwo months ago NBC News expanded a newscast that television viewers never see. Called the ''A'' news it is a package of international and national news reports that the network sells to more than 150 of its affiliated stations. However its expansion - including more time a bigger budget and an increased staff - has raised the ire of one of NBC's ''Nightly News'' two anchors Roger Mudd who sees it as a direct competitor to his own program which is currently third in the audience ratings after ABC and CBS.

Feb. 28. -- The cotton market was characterized during the past week by a decided activity in contrast with the many weeks of dullness which preceded it. Recent dullness was ascribed to the seemingly pegged prices for old crop months due to the small and dwindling certificated stocks and the high premiums prevailing for the better grades of spots that ordinarily might be tendered on contracts.

9,Smashing what they described as a smuggling ring that brought children to Brooklyn from Jamaica detectives raided a Flatbush apartment yesterday and arrested five adults they accused of collecting thousands of dollars from anxious immigrant parents.Two children had arrived from Jamaica over the weekend -- a boy and a girl each 9 years old the police said. They were sharing bunk beds in the cramped two-bedroom apartment with six younger children who are relatives of the adults who were taken into custody. All eight appeared to be in good condition the police said but as a precaution they were taken to local hospitals for observation.An investigator on the case Sgt. George Carrig said the police found out about the ring from a Bronx woman who had hired the suspects to bring her 9-year-old son to this country. The boy had been living with his grandmother in Jamaica since his mother moved to this country in 1991.The woman described by the police as an illegal immigrant said that she had paid $1100 in advance but had received a call yesterday saying that she could pick up her son only if she paid another $2000. She said she was told to hand over the money on a street corner a few blocks from the apartment. Phone Number Traced

9,This is the home and the era we like to pretend we remember - ''when life was slow and oh so mellow'' and ''when no one wept beside the willow.''The inhabitants of Fantasticks-land are two middle-aged fathers who garden and play cards one 20-year-old man who has not developed beyond the level of a young adolescent and one 16-year-old girl who is as riddled with far-fetched notions of romance as Swiss cheese is with holes. There are no mothers around to get in anybody's way.The manipulative fathers have built a wall between their houses on the perverse theory that if they discourage their children from being friends the boy and girl will assert their independence by growing up and getting married.''The Fantasticks'' spins a plot that is pure romantic fantasy shaded by the golden glow of make-believe. Its philosophy is conservative in spirit: in this musical the only place for a woman is in the house the world that begins on the other side of the garden's kumquats is not worth visiting and the love you find among your own kind is best.In the Studio Theater production directed by Macey Levin the show seems to traipse along at an unduly slow pace. It is as though the actors have moved along through the three decades since ''The Fantasticks'' opened and are now forcing themselves back in time as if they were walking backward across a sticky field of discarded spun sugar. Nothing in this production seems to without great effort.

0,A military-led relief effort would ''jeopardize all burden-sharing by U.N. agencies and other governments'' said George Rupp president of the International Rescue Committee. ''It would also compromise the independence and safety of humanitarian workers around the world.''Other aid agencies said that the military already pressed to supply food to its own troops on the battlefield would be unable to distribute food effectively to Iraqi civilians. They pointed to the chaotic distribution in the southern town of Safwan where Iraqi men shoved needy women out of the way to grab food boxes as coalition forces looked on.''Some American units are running low on food because they can't get supplies to them'' said Kenneth H. Bacon president of Refugees International. ''So how can they distribute food to the whole country?''Mr. Bacon and the leaders of 13 other major American aid agencies sent a letter to President Bush last week urging him to place the humanitarian effort in Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations.In doing so they said Mr. Bush would be living up to his own pledge made in the Azores last month that the United Nations would play a key role in the aid programs in Iraq. Further they said the World Food Program and Unicef the United Nations program for children had worked in Iraq for years and the United States should capitalize on their long experience.Two Unicef convoys tried to get into Iraq today. The one from the north with medicine and water purification equipment was stopped by Turkish border guards. In the south 5 out of perhaps 10 water tanker trucks were allowed past the border; 3 made it to Umm Qasr. One of the other two turned around when the driver became anxious; a second ended up in a ditch.The Umm Qasr docks the main entry point for assistance to Iraq remained idle today more than a week after coalition forces declared the facility secure. Several dozen Iraqi dock workers have been employed in recent days after interviews by a team of British soldiers. But so far the workers have been relegated to simple loading tasks at warehouses. The British said they had not yet found any Iraqis to take management positions at the docks.

9,"Turnover causes us tremendous heartburn" said Robert Coletta general sales and service manager for G.M.'s Buick division. Salespeople he said need about a year to fully understand a manufacturer's products and a dealer's procedures. And as cars grow more complex he added that learning period grows longer.One of the earliest deferred bonus plans began two years at Volkswagen which for every car sold pays the sales representative $150 -- in three installments spread over two years. The bonus comes on top of whatever commission the dealer pays the sales staff. Volkswagen officials have no statistics on whether the program has reduced turnover but they say dealers have told them it has helped.Audi of America offers yearly bonuses of $6000 to salespeople who sell 60 cars and $12000 and a trip to Germany to those who push 120 cars out the door. The wait is not as long as with Volkswagen's program but the idea is the same: to keep top producers in the fold some of whom had left as sales drooped."If you lose a guy who's worth a hundred cars a year it's like losing a whole dealer" said Joseph H. Tate general sales manager of Audi of America.Fritz Hitchcock the owner of the Toyota dealership where Mr. Salcido works calls the traditional commission system "very destructive." But Mr. Hitchcock who has set up his own deferred-bonus program doubts whether other alternatives -- some sort of guaranteed salary say -- would be the answer. "It's hard to figure out if a guy is giving you his all if he's on a guarantee as opposed to a commission" Mr. Hitchcock said.Mr. Salcido and other salesmen said that deferred bonus programs like the one offered by General Motors were a nice perk but were not enough to make salespeople stick around after several slow months at a dealership. "It's an extra but people want money now said one Detroit-area car salesman who insisted that he not be identified. "My mortgage bill is now." An Inherently Transient BusinessSalespeople and car dealers say they applaud any programs designed to reduce turnover and improve the image of salespeople. But many also believe the incentives or courses do not address the fundamental realities of selling cars that make it such a transient business: long hours few benefits and unpredictable paychecks.

9,Bernadette Castro the Republican candidate for United States Senate said yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to persuade her during a private meeting at Gracie Mansion on Sunday night to "consider distancing" herself from her party's gubernatorial candidate George E. Pataki.Ms. Castro a long-time friend and financial contributor to the Mayor told reporters at an impromptu news conference on Fifth Avenue that she refused. "I'm a member of the Republican ticket" she said. "George Pataki is the head of the ticket. If I didn't think he would be a good governor I wouldn't have joined the ticket in the first place."Providing a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes wrangling inside the Republican Party Ms. Castro attributed the Mayor's decision to cross party lines and support Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a Democrat to his long-running tensions with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato who helped engineer Mr. Pataki's candidacy."Look we're all grownups in this" she said contending that the real dispute was not between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani. "It's between Alfonse and Rudy. That's what it's all about. Rudy doesn't want Alfonse controlling the Republican Party."

7,NAIROBI Kenya May 31—Kenya's Minister for Tourism and Wildlife said today that the Government would follow up its ban on big‐game hunting with a program to crack down on poachers whose activities are a major cause of the dwindling of the country's wildlife.While conceding that legal hunting accounted for the deaths of only 6000 animals last year the minister Matthew J. Ogutu said the ban would enable game wardens to spot poachers more easily since killing of any kind would now be outlawed.In the past he noted hunters and poachers used the same kind of weapons and operated in the same areas and so it was difficult to distinguish between them. “Now anyone found killing breaking the law” he said. “The Government has the long arm to stamp out the poachers.”The minister said that $2.9 million would be spent on helicopters LandRovers and radios to step up his department's antipoaching patrols. The World Bank is supplying the money.

"We sold about half of them to car dealers and retailed the other half."

0,The grisly death of real estate developer Andrew Kissel has gripped the wealthy community of Greenwich Conn. where he lived and brought back memories of the highly publicized death of his brother who had been a prominent banker for Goldman Sachs and then Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.In this week’s cover story New York Magazine recounts the history of the Kissel family offering a long and sordid tale of greed lust and fraud.The banker Robert Kissel was murdered by his wife. And early last month his brother Andrew was found dead after being charged with fraud in three states. Recriminations continue among the surviving family members.Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the story is the fate of the five children at the center of it all. As portrayed in the article they were used as pawns in an ongoing game of petty squabbling among the adults they know best. Two of them lost one parent while three lost a parent and saw another go to prison. One unknowingly fed her father narcotics in a milkshake so that her mother could bludgeon him to death.Go to Article from New York Magazine

8,It was Governor Carey who decided to house prisoners in empty buildings of the Long Island psychiatric hospital. Protesting neighbors organized an articulate determined pressure group.In the 1982 campaign all the gubernatorial candidates including Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Koch promised to close the Pilgrim prison. Mayor Koch later changed his mind concluding that a public that demands crime control has to accept more jails and prisons. But Mr. Cuomo stuck to his promise.The Pilgrim prison has operated since 1982 without posing any threat to the community. Objections to it are irrational. The fact that its prisoners can be accommodated elsewhere hardly justifies its abandonment. The new prison construction will only make a potentially catastrophic situation barely tolerable.Closing Pilgrim offers powerful encouragement to the mindless ''not-in-my-neighborhood'' sentiment that hopelessly complicates the siting of many necessary projects - sewage-treatment plants shelters for the homeless homes for the retarded drug rehabilitation centers.

9,DEAR DIARY:Recently when buying tickets at Avery Fisher Hall I handed over a charge card to the young man behind the ticket window and continued my conversation with my two daughters.The young man handed back the form to sign and said ''I must say you look better in person.''Startled I looked down at the card.I had given him the American Kennel Club charge card which has a photograph of a Welsh corgi in the upper corner. SARA REGUERA loud banging at 2 A.M. drew Barbara Rohdie's daughter-in-law Alisa to the window of her Greenwich Village apartment recently and she noted a tow-truck hitching up a car. She suggested that her husband check to see if their car had met a similar fate.
1,PhotoA case can be made that the craze for found-footage horror movies — see “Paranormal Activity” Volumes 1-4 — began in Maryland. The real town of Burkittsville in the western part of the state was the setting of “The Blair Witch Project” back in 1999. “The Bay” which takes place in a fictional Chesapeake Bay hamlet called Claridge is something of a homecoming. It also represents an earnest if not entirely persuasive attempt to tease out some of the latent allegorical meanings of the genre and to use fright to raise questions about the state of the environment.The movie directed by Barry Levinson from a script by Michael Wallach is framed by a Skype interview with a Donna Thompson (Kether Donohue) a young woman recalling horrific events she witnessed as a student journalist on July 4 2009. At the time an opening sequence reminds us the news was full of reports of the mysterious deaths of millions of birds and fish. To their numbers were added most of the human population of Claridge.Clips of Donna’s news report are interspersed with the usual material that you encounter in movies like this: conference calls cellphone grabs and the video diary of a young couple (Kristen Connolly and Will Rogers) cruising toward Maryland on a boat with their infant son. All of it adds up to a collage of escalating grossness as innocent water-based fun turns into a grisly epidemic fueled by ecological malfeasance.Rashes and vomiting give way to severed tongues chewed-up and exploding abdomens all of it caused by isopods — insectlike aquatic beasts mutated by runoff from a chicken-processing plant and other environmental crimes. The quiet streets and marinas of Claridge soon resemble the landscape of a zombie movie though the predators have more in common with the eager breeders of the “Alien” movies.I’m in no position to assess the science of “Bay” and I applaud in principle its attempt to be a conscientious piece of genre entertainment. I only wish it were scarier or indeed scary at all. Mr. Levinson has many skills as a filmmaker — he is past having anything to prove on that score — but the basic techniques of dread and suspense don’t seem to interest him very much. There is a lot of nasty stuff to look at but very little that is genuinely haunting jolting or terrifying. If you are not already afraid about the state of our waterways this movie won’t help you get there.“The Bay” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Those isopods do some serious damage.

8,Amid rumors that Michael Spinks the International Boxing Federation heavyweight champion and Butch Lewis his promoter intend to announce at a news conference today that they are withdrawing from the Home Box Office heavyweight-unification series Rock Newman a spokesman for Lewis would say only that ''Butch is going to make a statement to clear up rumors and misconceptions.''According to the rumors Lewis's withdrawal of Spinks would be in protest of the policies of the World Boxing Association in recognizing fighters from South Africa.With Spinks out of the HBO series Lewis would probably have an easier time making a lucrative match for Spinks against Gerry Cooney. In the past Dennis Rappaport Cooney's co-manager has indicated he would not guarantee that Cooney would stay in the HBO series because it would limit future purses.Yesterday Rappaport said that he had made a congratulatory call to Lewis after Spinks beat Steffen Tangstad on Sept. 6 but that he and Lewis had not spoken since then. ''I'm as surprised as anyone else by the rumors'' said Rappaport. ''And every time I tell people I haven't been talking with Butch they say 'Then why would he withdraw if there's no Gerry Cooney fight locked up?' ''

9,This explains the new enthusiasm for controlling nitrogen compounds from coal-burning power plants. It also explains why Congress created the Ozone Transport Commission made up of representatives of 12 Northeastern states plus the District of Columbia who have the mandate to figure out strategies for controlling regionwide smog sources.Some important anti-smog measures are already dictated by Federal law and are thus uncomplicated by the push and shove of regional interests. For example the region will benefit from tougher emissions standards to be applied to new cars nationwide.But Eric Svenson of New Jersey's giant utility the Public Service Electric and Gas Company argues that such measures "alone won't even come close" to helping the states meet ozone standards during the dog days of summer. That leaves it to the states to explain how they are going to reduce volatile organic compounds emissions 15 percent by 1996 plus cut both organic and nitrogen compounds by 3 percent annually.The members of the Ozone Transport Commission made headlines in February by asking the Environmental Protection Agency to impose on the Northeast the same exceptionally stringent standards on new autos that will be required in smog-burdened California. But Delaware New Hampshire New Jersey and Virginia demurred because of worries about the cost. And the American automobile industry is fighting back offering to produce a vehicle that would be cleaner sooner but would not meet the California standard.Hardly anyone is claiming that the California vehicle standards alone would get the Northeast where it must go. Then what? Targeting nitrogen compounds with heavy emphasis on power plants which produce about half of the region's emissions. But the states are bitterly divided on how to proceed and no wonder. Smog in the CorridorThe worst smog in the region is along the "Amtrak corridor" from Washington to Boston. But the bulk of the nitrogen compounds notes John Elston New Jersey's official in charge of air quality comes from plants far to the west. And such areas have little motivation to pitch in because little of the benefit would go to their own ratepayers.Adding sand to the wheels of negotiation there is still much debate over allowing smog producers to pay rather than to play. A free market trading system already gives power plants broad discretion in controlling emissions that generate acid rain. A dirty plant can buy pollution rights from a clean plant for example.

9,On a mild day in March a stroller in Vienna's Volksgarten (People's Garden) notices that the ravens are suddenly missing from their posts in the trees. Their departure to Russia anticipates the end of the gloomy Danubian winter. Because of the ravens some Viennese birdwatchers prefer to visit this small park in winter but given its central location the Volksgarten is truly a park for all hours and seasons.Built in the 1820's on the spot where Napoleon's retreating army removed a fortification from the city's glacis the Volksgarten is refined as parks go holding nature at a distance. The grass is off-limits but visitors can walk along the maze of paths admiring the rose garden examining the neoclassical Temple of Theseus and pausing at the monument to the beloved Empress Elisabeth who was assassinated in 1898 in Geneva. In one corner is a small octagon-shaped pavilion where coffee and cake are served outside once the weather is predictably nice.Opening off the Volksgarten and spatially part of it is the Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square) from which one can look onto the greatest panorama in all Vienna: the Burgtheater a corner of the neo-Renaissance University the neo-Gothic steeple of the Rathaus (City Hall) the racing chariots atop the Parliament and straight ahead the domes of the Fine Arts and Natural History museums. On the Heldenplatz you can lie in the large tracts of grass among the lilac bushes and wonder at how much sky is visible from the center of a city.

1,WASHINGTON — President Obama speaking two weeks after the military ended a ban on openly gay service members told a prominent gay-rights group here on Saturday night that “no one has to live a lie to serve the country they love.”Mr. Obama received a jubilant reception from the audience at a dinner held by the group the Human Rights Campaign. He was greeted with a standing ovation and was interrupted him several times with raucous applause particularly when he declared that “ ‘don’t ask don’t’ tell is history.”The president strongly supported the repeal of that policy which prevented openly gay and lesbian soldiers from serving in the military and he signed the order ending it in December. Gay men and lesbians he said were proudly serving around the world -– the only difference being that they could now display their family photos.In a sharp jab at the Republican presidential field Mr. Obama noted that none of the candidates protested when members of the audience at a recent debate booed a gay soldier who had served in Iraq.“You want to be commander in chief” the president said drawing cheers “you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States even when it’s not politically convenient.”On Saturday evening at least the audience seemed ready to overlook that Mr. Obama had not declared his support for same-sex marriage a refusal that has rankled many gay men and lesbians.“Every single American -– gay bisexual and transgender -– deserves to be treated equally before the law” the president said the closest he came on Saturday to endorsing same-sex marriage rights.Mr. Obama has said his views on same-sex marriage are “evolving.” But since June when New York State passed a law legalizing such marriages he has come under mounting pressure to take a stand. At a gay pride reception at the White House shortly after the New York law was passed one guest wore a button on his lapel that said “Evolve already.”On Saturday the president drew attention to other measures he had taken including legislation requiring hospitals to allow people access to same-sex partners who are patients an anti-hate-crime law and his order to the Justice Department not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman.Mr. Obama managed to get in a plug for his $447 billion jobs bill urging the Human Rights Campaign’s members to put pressure on Congress to pass the bill.He also reeled off a couple of jokes. Noting that he had just returned from California Mr. Obama said he had “held some productive bilateral talks with your leader Lady Gaga.” The pop diva with sky-high heels and hair had towered over the president at a fund-raiser in Atherton Calif.

8,To close the $882 million budget gap forecast for next year's 1989-90 budget Democrats who control both the House of Representatives and the Senate are expected to call for limited growth in government spending and to raise additional funds through increases in alcohol and tobacco taxes user fees the state's tax on interest and dividend income as well as bridge and highway tolls. They may also move to remove exemptions to the state's 7.5 percent sales tax.The co-chairmen of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee Senator Joseph H. Harper Jr. Democrat of New Britain and Representative Paul Gionfriddo Democrat of Middletown have sent a letter to other lawmakers warning that the focus of the budget would be ''to maintain essential services and nothing else.'' The words ''essential'' and nothing else'' were underlined.But Republicans are expected to oppose tax increases and instead push for an outright freeze on state spending and hiring as well as the reallocation of some appropriations made for the current fiscal year.One often-cited example of reallocating or cutting expenditures is to reduce the $93 million paid to consultants this year. ''They are everywhere'' said Representative Robert G. Jaekle the House minority leader a Republican from Stratford.The financing requested by all state departments would bring the state's 1989-90 budget to about $7.1 billion. Because of labor agreements some mandatory expenditures and other built-in costs a zero-growth budget is not fiscally feasible. Commissioners believe a 12 percent increase in the current budget is needed to keep services at the present level.Neither party believes that it is politically practical to institute a state income tax at this time. Mr. O'Neill a Democrat has also indicated that his budget to be sent to the General Assembly in early February would probably not include layoffs among the state's 44200 employees. Parties Blame Each OtherAnthony V. Milano the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management has attributed the projected deficits for both the current and next fiscal years to overly optimistic projections of sales tax revenue and a drop in corporation tax collections resulting from the Federal tax overhaul.

0,Just a short while ago President Bush made good on his promise and vetoed the war spending bill that included a timeline for troop withdrawal passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress last month. He made his action public in a short announcement saying the Democrats had approved a plan that set a “rigid and artificial” deadline that “would impose impossible conditions for our commanders and troops in combat.”“I recognize that many Democrats saw this bill as an opportunity to make a political statement about their opposition to the war” he said. “They sent their message” but now he warned Congress should begin working on a new bill so that troops can get necessary funds. A meeting with Congressional leaders from both parties is scheduled for tomorrow at the White House. Benchmarks for the Iraqi government appear to be a likely starting point for negotiations.“The need to act is urgent” he said.Mr. Bush also defended his troop buildup saying that sectarian murders in Iraq have decreased “substantially” since January. He added that the suicide attacks still occurring are “largely the work of Al Qaeda the enemy that everyone agrees we should be fighting.”Though Mr. Bush did not address the anniversary of his “mission accomplished” speech war opponents have made much of the fact that the veto comes exactly four years after Mr. Bush announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended with a banner that read “Mission Accomplished” behind him.Referring to the banner John Edwards seeking the Democrats’ nomination said at a town hall meeting in Seattle today “All the photo ops in the world can’t hide the truth – his disastrous mismanagement of the war has left our troops in harm’s way and made Iraq a breeding ground for terrorists.”“When the president vetoes the bill it is George Bush who is not supporting our troops and nobody else” he added.Americans United for Change a liberal group has been running an ad nationwide since Friday comparing Mr. Bush’s 2003 declaration with footage of violence since then. “He was wrong then and he is wrong now” an announcer says before urging Mr. Bush not to veto the bill.Text of President Bush’s StatementUpdate: The Democrats’ leaders in Congress Senator Harry Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosi just held a brief press conference.“In the coming days we’ll continue to reach out to the president and we hope congressional Republicans who remained silent—congressional Republicans through this whole debate—will work with us as well” said Mr. Reid. “But if the president thinks that by vetoing this bill he’ll stop us from working to change the direction of the war in Iraq he is mistaken.”

1,Fisk University in Nashville which wants to sell a $30 million ownership stake in its Stieglitz art collection to raise money plans to appeal a court decision that set limits on the sale the university announced on Wednesday.The ownership stake is going to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville Ark. but the sale has raised concerns among those who question the university’s need to sell items given to it as a public trust by the artist Georgia O’Keeffe who married the photographer Alfred Stieglitz.The university filed a notice with the Davidson County Chancery Court in Nashville that it would appeal the Nov. 3 ruling that Fisk could spend only $10 million of the $30 million at its discretion. The remainder would be placed in an independent endowment fund and Fisk would be allowed to use only about $1 million of income from the endowment to support the collection which was donated to the university about 50 years ago.“This restriction effectively confiscates proceeds from the approved sharing agreement and places Fisk in a more risky position than before” said Hazel R. O’Leary Fisk’s president in a statement.Fisk’s chairman Robert W. Norton added “The order will result in an excessive endowment for the art collection while ignoring the need to endow Fisk’s outstanding academic programs for which it has received national recognition.”

0,New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in presenting the city’s budget counseled austerity becuse he sees the real estate market slowing and prices dropping. That would mean less tax revenue.“The city’s commercial occupancy rate is the highest in the nation. New York’s real estate market is expected to slow however with a 10% decline in home prices a 14% decline in home sales over the next few years and a significant decline in real estate transaction taxes that have buoyed the City’s tax revenue in the last few fiscal years.”It’s a healthy warning to other localities that are awash in tax money thanks to the housing boom. It isn’t going to last. — DAMON DARLIN

1,PhotoDiageo and the family that manufactures Jose Cuervo tequila are in advanced talks to swap two of their best-known brands a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Saturday.Under the proposed terms Diageo would acquire full control of the fast-growing Don Julio tequila brand from Cuervo as well as a cash payment.In return Cuervo would gain Diageo’s Bushmills brand of Irish whiskey.A transaction may be announced as soon as next week though talks between the two sides are continuing and may still fall apart this person cautioned. Cuervo which is owned by the Beckmann family that is descended from Jose Antonio de Cuervo is currently raising financing to support the deal.Should an agreement be reached it would come nearly two years after Diageo abandoned its effort to buy Cuervo outright part of the British drinks giant’s campaign to increase its presence in the tequila market. Since then the beverage conglomerate — whose other offerings include Johnnie Walker Smirnoff and Tanqueray — has made smaller tequila acquisitions including the Peligroso and DeLeón brands.But it will gain a major foothold by buying full control of Don Julio a top-selling brand of tequila. Unlike Cuervo’s namesake spirit Don Julio is regarded as a premium brand that commands higher prices and has benefited from a steady rise in sales in recent years. Diageo traces its history with the brand back to 1999 when its predecessor the Seagram Company invested in the company.Diageo reported that its tequila sales rose 34 percent in its fiscal year ended June 30 largely on the strong performance of Don Julio.Cuervo meanwhile will gain control of Bushmills one of the biggest brands of Irish whiskey. Diageo reported that the spirit’s sales rose 7 percent in its fiscal year ended June 30.Representatives for Diageo and Cuervo were not immediately available for comment.News of the talks was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
8,''Narcissistic vulnerabilities'' as psychoanalysts refer to them make people particularly sensitive to how other people regard them. ''You see it in marriage in friendships at work'' Dr. Ornstein said. ''If your boss fails to smile when you greet him it may create a withdrawn anxious feeling. If so your self-esteem has been hurt. A sturdy self absorbs that; it has a bank account of self-esteem so it's not unbalanced. But if you're vulnerable then these seemingly small slights are like a large trauma.''On the surface extreme narcissists are often brash and self-assured surrounded by an aura of success. Indeed they are often successful in their careers and relationships. But beneath that success feelings of inadequacy create the constant need to keep inflating their sense of themselves. If they do not get the praise they need they can lapse into depression and rage. The Workaholic's RewardAdmiration rather than the pure pleasure of doing things well is what propels narcissists to their success psychoanalysts say. Thus many workaholics put in their long hours out of the narcissist's need to to be applauded. And of course the same need makes many narcissists gravitate to careers such as acting modeling or politics where the applause is explicit.Many difficulties in intimate relations are due to narcissism according to David A. Berkowitz a psychiatrist at Tufts University.''Narcissism makes someone vulnerable to the least failure to be loved or accepted just as they are by their partner'' Dr. Berkowitz said. ''Marriage brings to the fore all one's childhood yearnings for unconditional acceptance. A successful marriage includes the freedom to regress to enjoy a childlike dependency. But in marriage a couple also tend to re-enact early relationships with parents who failed to give them enough love. This is particularly hard on those with the emotional vulnerabilities of the narcissist.''Narcissists tend to surround themselves with people will will laud them rather than give criticism when it is needed. They are drawn too to the trappings of success such as automobiles or houses that announce their worth to the world. Narcissists find in them support their grandiose sense of themselves.Narcissists are typically charming and friendly. Their own intense need for adulation makes them sensitive to the same needs in others and so they are particularly adept at ingratiating themselves. But there is a hidden agenda to their friendliness: they are interested only to the extent that their own self-importance is fed by it.

0,Romania and Bulgaria now the European Union’s poorest members hope that membership will help them raise per-capita wealth which is one-third of the union’s average. Their accession the union’s second wave of enlargement into the formerly Communist Eastern Europe also will give the union a stable political and economic anchor in a region surrounded by unstable neighbors.Romania with a population of about 22 million becomes the European Union’s seventh-largest member; it is about half the size of Poland but double the size of Hungary and Czech Republic. Bulgaria with a population of 7.7 million is far smaller.For Romania which suffered one of Eastern Europe’s most brutal Communist dictatorships under Nicolae Ceausescu before he was overthrown in 1989 being moored to the European Union marks an important symbolic final break with a difficult past. For Bulgaria whose history is marked by conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Soviet occupation union membership is also viewed as a source of economic and democratic stability.The entry of the Balkan countries comes as the European Union is experiencing expansion fatigue following the bloc’s enlargement in May 2004 from 15 countries to 25.With the latest additions the union has a population of nearly 489 million. It will work in 32 official languages ranging from Bulgarian to Gaelic while its Brussels bureaucracy will expand to encompass 27 European commissioners.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This has prompted some members like France to worry that the European Union will become economically overburdened institutionally unwieldy and ultimately unmanageable.The European Union’s cautious approach to further expansion was reflected in the toughest conditions ever imposed on union entrants including the creation of a what has been termed a nuclear option allowing the European Commission to delay the accession of Romania and Bulgaria if they fell behind on changes required for entry.Even now that they are in the union the two countries will be subject to unprecedented safeguards intended to keep them from backtracking. These include the commission’s power to suspend some of the rights that come with membership like generous economic aid. The commission also has threatened to suspend recognition of arrest warrants and decisions made by Bulgarian courts if the country does not improve judicial reforms.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyRomania expects to receive as much as 1.7 billion euros in the first year after entry while Bulgaria with a smaller population would be entitled to 661 million euros.The entry of the two countries comes as the European Union is grappling with fears that westward migration from its poorer members in the east risks undermining the bloc’s social standards. At the time of the union’s last enlargement in May 2004 the European Commission estimated that the number of migrants throughout the bloc would total 70000 to 150000 a year; in practice Britain alone is estimated to have received up to 600000 in the past three years.Consequently job-seekers from Romania and Bulgaria are likely to face stiff restrictions in the rest of the European Union. Britain Sweden and Ireland which opened their doors to union newcomers in 2004 have already signaled that they are less inclined to do so now. Romanians and Bulgarians may also face obstacles in labor markets in Hungary Slovakia and the Czech Republic which are themselves confronting restrictions by countries further west.At a recent summit meeting in Brussels union leaders toughened their tone on enlargement but stopped short of setting new hurdles to expansion. They reaffirmed backing for the eventual membership of Turkey and the western Balkan states: Albania Bosnia Croatia Macedonia Montenegro and Serbia.But they insisted that expansion could not proceed unless the union changed its outmoded institutions including a decision-making system in which national vetoes remain widespread.Romania and Bulgaria both economically liberal supporters of the United States as well as members of NATO are likely to fall into the European Union’s camp of countries with a bias against state protectionism. Analysts predict they will be less prone to divisiveness than newcomers like Poland because they will be eager to prove their European credentials to their new partners some of whom were wary of letting them in.

9,Buchanan led all scorers with 18 points in the 80th meeting between the two schools."It's an old rivalry so maybe they came out a little bit nervous" Buchanan said. "Our defensive pressure may have forced them into some things but I think it was mostly they were just missing their shots."The Purple Eagles (1-2) quickly shot themselves out of the game.Sure the Redmen used two of their eight first-half steals to set up their first two baskets. And yes they were able to work the transition game to add a few more layups off the break taking a 12-2 lead six minutes in.But the real problem was poor shooting by Niagara which didn't hit a shot from further than 12 feet in the first half. After a frosty 5-for-28 performance from the field in the first half Niagara trailed by 34-14 at halftime. S. Carolina 76 N. Carolina 74CHARLOTTE N.C. (AP) -- Michael Glover scored on a layup with eight seconds left and South Carolina celebrated the one-night renewal of an old rivalry with an upset of North Carolina in the Tournament of Champions.George Lynch's follow shot with 1:54 left gave the Tar Heels a 72-68 lead. Joe Rhett then hit the front end of a two-shot foul with 1:07 left but when he missed the second the Gamecocks (3-1) got the rebound and Barry Manning hit a 3-pointer with 49 seconds left to tie the score 72-72.

9,It may well make sense to interpret the flight of Iraq's most modern fighter planes to Iran in this context. While American and other Western military analysts speculated about what initially seemed a large-scale Iraqi defection several Saudi military officers quietly argued that the pilots had flown to Iran to prevent the allies from destroying the planes on the ground as Israel did nearly 24 years ago.Apart from the relief expressed here that another Arab leader had not been humiliated at the hands of the West there is a deep conviction in Riyadh Cairo and Damascus that Iraq must not be destroyed or dismembered in an effort to free Kuwait.Baghdad is seen as a bulwark against the reassertion of Iranian influence in the region something feared by Saudi Arabia and other countries with Sunni Muslim majorities. Animosity between Iranian Shiite Muslims and the Sunni Muslim world intensified duirng the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. Most gulf nations with sizable Shiite populations experienced an increase in terrorist attacks and attempts during the war. A Postwar Role for BaghdadThe conviction that Iraq should be preserved as a regional military power under new management was reflected in a statement issued Wednesday by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt who met in the Red Sea port of Jidda for several hours. The two reiterated their call to Mr. Hussein to withdraw and spare his country further devastation. They said an immediate cease-fire was possible if the Iraqi leader even at this late date signaled his intention to withdraw from Kuwait.Representatives of both countries have emphasized that the goal of the war was only to free Kuwait from Iraqi control. In a recent interview broadcast on the BBC Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Butros Ghali underscored the point by asserting that Egypt could coexist with any Iraqi Government that removed its forces from Kuwait even one headed by Mr. Hussein.

6,BONN July 31—West German military leaders forcefully rejected today a French plan to answer any Communist aggression with a massive nuclear attack.Qualified sources stressed that the French idea to use nuclear arms from the start of hostilities ran counter to the principle of a graduated deterrent. This principle has been followed by the West German Government in line with the policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.The French proposal was expounded in a recent article by Gen. Charles Ailleret Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff.In contrast with official expressions that there is unity among. the Western allies regarding the use of ground troops in Europe there are experts who believe that France has taken herself out and is following an independent policy.

0,In a fresh sign of the economic turmoil hitting publishing and the Internet 8020 Media the company behind the reader-generated photography journal JPG Magazine is shutting down.The company which described itself as a “revolutionary new hybrid media company” will announce the move to its community of readers and contributors on Friday morning according to Mitchell Fox 8020’s chief executive.“In the face of these extraordinary economic times in a devastated advertising climate we can no longer continue to operate the business due to lack of funds and hence we have to close 8020 Media effective immediately” Mr. Fox wrote in a letter he said he was sending to a few friends of the company.8020 Media was backed by Halsey Minor the founder of CNet Networks and located in the San Francisco office of his investing firm Minor Ventures. It had an unusual low-cost editorial structure that many media and technology pundits pointed to as a model for the future. JPG Magazine had a small staff but solicited contributions from amateur photographers and asked its community of readers and contributors to vote for the best pictures which then made it into a bimonthly print magazine. The company’s similar travel magazine Everywhere ceased publication in August.JPG had a circulation of around 50000 and had recently secured some prominent space on newsstands around the country.But ultimately the money ran out and Mr. Minor declined to invest more according to a person with knowledge of the situation. 8020 was attempting to either raise more money from other investors or to sell itself to big media names including the Meredith Corporation and Conde Nast but with no success. Mr. Minor could not be reached for comment on Thursday.The 18 employees who worked for 8020 were given the holiday week off. On Tuesday they received individual telephone calls and e-mail messages telling them that the company had exhausted its options and was shutting down.Here is the full text of Mitchell Fox’s note to 8020’s friends:
8,It was 50 years ago last week that New York University pulled off what is still regarded as the greatest college-football upset in the city's history. At the end of a season that had begun with a 60-0 loss to Ohio State and had included only four victories in eight games all over weak teams the wilting Violets blossomed into legend by defeating previously unbeaten Fordham and its Seven Blocks of Granite 7-6 in a Thanksgiving Day game that drew 50000 to Yankee Stadium.To mark the anniversary the N.Y.U. Varsity Club will honor surviving members of both teams at a dinner tomorrow night. The hero of the game Howard Dunney whose series of coffin-corner punts are credited with keeping the Rams in a hole they could not dig out of won't be able to attend but there will be a worthy stand-in: Sal Somma the blocking back who kicked the extra point that made the difference.''I've gotten a lot of mileage out of that'' says the 76-year-old Somma who from 1948 to 1976 coached at Staten Island's New Dorp High School where he won half a dozen city championships. When New Dorp found itself behind at halftime Somma recalls he would cite the famous upset in persuading his players that ''no matter how things look you can still win.''The 1936 game played a year after the Rams had spoiled an undefeated N.Y.U. season and a sure invitation to the Rose Bowl by beating the Violets at the Polo Grounds has spawned a few myths. One of them is that Fordham missed out on a trip to the Rose Bowl because of the loss. In fact that hope had pretty much been dashed the week before when the Rams were tied by Georgia 7-7 after their earlier 0-0 tie with Pitt the team that ultimately got the Rose Bowl bid.
9,Washington's relations with Israel have been relatively smooth during the gulf crisis American and Israeli officials say. Israel has been responsive to American requests that it not become directly involved in the conflict or take any pre-emptive action against Iraq. Washington in turn made clear that it was willing to consider added military aid to Israel.The crisis has deflected attention from the impasse that had been developing between the Administration and Jerusalem over the Israeli Government's reluctance to open a dialogue with the Palestinians on the basis of a compromise formula proposed last spring by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.To bolster Saudi Arabia against a possible attack from Iraq the Administration announced this week that it would make an emergency sale of $2.2 billion worth of weapons to Riyadh including 24 F-15 fighter planes 150 M-60 tanks and 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. In addition Pentagon officials said the United States would probably sell the Saudis another 24 F-15's early next year.''The White House and State Department called to say they recognized an imbalance was occurring and that some form of additional weaponry for Israel would be found to remedy that'' said Senator Rudy Boschwitz Republican of Minnesota.'Shifting Alliances'One leader of an American Jewish group speaking on the condition of anonymity said: ''Arms to the Saudis pose a real dilemma for the Jewish community. On the one hand Saudi Arabia has legitimate defense needs right now. But this latest package constitutes a clear threat to Israel in the long run. No one knows what will happen to Saudi Arabia in the future. Middle East politics is made up of shifting alliances.''Several hurdles must still be cleared to complete the proposed arms deal. One problem is matching the list of weapons that Israel wants with what the United States can afford to give up.Soviet Talks May Free TanksThe Pentagon for example expects to have surplus M-60 tanks once arms control talks with the Soviet Union are concluded. The available tanks however are an older version of the model the Israelis would like and would not be available for several months.

9,Oh and don't worry about him taking his time mulling over script ideas. He said that the company was already planning to shoot a movie version of the play ''Hospitality Suite'' and that he expected to direct what he called ''a bigger more personal story maybe in a year or so.'' Some movies he may just produce without appearing in front of or behind the camera he said.''I wanted to do something that wasn't a vanity deal'' said Mr. Spacey referring to the fact that many studios offer successful actors production arrangements that actually generate few if any movies. ''There's a real opportunity for my company to become a player.''The company's deal with Fine Line Cinema a unit of Time Warner's New Line allows him to retain foreign distribution rights on some of his films and to create over time a library of movies in which he will own a substantial interest.''I'm interested in walking down roads I haven't walked down before'' Mr. Spacey said.At this busy time in his career it is striking though that he is currently appearing in ''Hurlyburly'' a movie that represents an unusually well-trodden road. As Mr. Spacey noted when he made the leap from regional theater to the New York stage some years ago it was by acting in ''Hurlyburly.''In fact he said he played almost every part in the dark drama before the run was through and his career had begun. In the film he plays the smooth reptilian Mickey.
0,I had no inkling of the brilliant new postage stamps honoring America’s first family of animation – the Simpsons – issued by the United States Postal Service in early May. At least not until Saturday when the accumulation of stampless unmailed bills chez moi forced an emergency trip to the post office.There they were. Homer Marge Bart Lisa and Maggie — each in a classic head shot against a little rectangular patch of electric color beaming forth with psychic and visual power. There was no sound motion space or plot to help them out only color line scale and lots of personality. I may speak more as a “Simpsons” fan than an art critic but really are these not among the best American stamps ever? Disregard our age’s plethora of Simpsoniana – the juice cups the lunch boxes the toothbrushes. Contemplate the chance of progress within the limited format of the postage stamp. There’s not much but Simpsons stamps make some. They pop.First the peerless expressions defined by Matt Groening’s inimitable thickish line. Homer is caught with mouth agape and tongue rippling — the panicked squawk not the famous “D’oh.” Marge purses her lips and looks confused as if vaguely sensing one of Homer’s clumsy scams. Bart wears his sweaty busted-again grin. Lisa is all sweet I-tried-to-tell-you beneficence. Maggie’s glare suggests that someone is stepping on her nightgown. Her pacifier has two bounce commas the only sign of motion in the entire series.Second chromatic wattage. The Simpson palette has always seemed as radical and subversive as the show’s social commentary and close in artifice to that of innovative colorists like Andy Warhol Bruce Nauman and Matthew Barney. Five amped-up hues suffice: egg-yolk yellow magenta Marge-Simpson’s-hair blue darkened chartreuse and lavender plus important bits of white (mainly eyes and teeth) and touches of red. Subtle distinctions of tonality are made. Homer’s yellow head is seen against a slightly darker yellow background. Marge’s hair is slightly darker than the blue behind Bart. Red defines only Homer’s tongue Maggie’s pacifier Marge’s beads and the smidgeon of Bart’s T-shirt.Third less is more. The “Simpsons” gestalt is boiled down to its essence and so is stampness. The images are stripped of detail except for the letters USA and the number 44 (cents the new first class). No fussy engraved textures no identifying names. This allows color to take over and the faces to pop out. Like a Richard Serra sculpture only smaller and a whole lot cheaper the stamps prove the adage that scale has nothing to do with size. They strike David-like blows against the Goliaths of American visual illiteracy.It’s not news that the Simpsons work almost as well off screen as on. But these images still amaze. Slowed to a standstill deeply cropped and confined their portraits single out for tribute both the family’s indelible inmates and the breathtaking economy that brings them to life. I don’t know whether to affix them to my delinquent bills or have them framed.
1,PhotoThe case of Burch vs. Burch is about to be closed.After a year of legal wrangling between the designer Tory Burch and her former husband Chris Burch who is also the owner of the clothing retailer C. Wonder Ms. Burch announced on Tuesday night that an agreement had been reached to settle all pending legal claims between the couple.PhotoAdditionally Ms. Burch said that BDT Capital Partners and General Atlantic were making minority investments in the company. Mr. Burch will retain at least some of his stake in the business which the Burches founded together in 2003 while they were still married.Mr. Burch had filed a lawsuit against Ms. Burch in October claiming that she and the board members of her company had interfered with his attempts to sell part of his 28 percent stake. Ms. Burch responded with counterclaims that Mr. Burch was at fault because after their divorce in 2007 he started C. Wonder a company with similar preppy clothing and store designs to hers. Any interested investors were hesitant to make a deal until the Burches settled their differences.While the spat spilled over into the press and then the courts (a judge in the case described it as a “drunken WASP fest”) both parties were interested in a settlement to protect their investments in the Tory Burch brand which has sales of roughly $800 million annually and has been one of the most successful new fashion businesses of the last decade.

1,PhotoTHURSDAY PUZZLE — Every now and then I have this anxiety dream where something truly bizarre happens to The New York Times crossword puzzle on its way from Will Shortz’s desk to the print paper or the Internet. A lot of tricky stuff has to happen to get your puzzles to you including getting them past the EMUs in one piece so it’s not that far-fetched to think that my brain might worry about what might happen if say parts of the clues suddenly disappeared.What’s that you say? The clues really have disappeared? Oh that. That’s what we call a design feature not a flaw. Today’s puzzle by Timothy Polin makes good use of the phrase INVISIBLE INK by giving us the first letter of the theme clues and leaving us to figure out how those letters relate to the answers.For example we have the letter K as the sole clue at 18 Across and the answer is ECCENTRICITY. What does the letter K have to do with ECCENTRICITY? Well if you have already solved the revealer at 67 Across you know that we’re dealing with INVISIBLE INK. That INK has disappeared from the clue which would be “Kink” if we weren’t in the middle of one of my anxiety dreams. Kink of course is a synonym for ECCENTRICITY. Similarly “Fink” is a synonym for STOOL PIGEON (53 Across). I got held up at the S at 12 Down because I couldn’t figure out how FOUNDER was a synonym for “Sink” and thought it was incorrect. I asked Mr. Polin about this and I’m told that FOUNDER is a nautical term that means to fill up with water and sink.So now that we all acknowledge that the clues aren’t really missing I can relax and tell you that the Clue(s) of the day for me were “Frank refusal?” for NEIN and “Tough pill to swallow” for LOZENGE.Let’s see what Mr. Polin has to say for himself:Constructor’s NotesInspiration sometimes finds you in the strangest places. The phrase INVISIBLE INK had been stuck in my head for a long time but I’d never been able to wrangle it into a good crossword theme. Last May I even submitted a Sunday-sized puzzle with a completely different theme based on the same phrase which was rejected mercifully for a number of good reasons. It wasn’t until coming back from dropping someone off at the airport early one morning this past January semi-delirious from lack of sleep that I had this sudden insight: Tim you moron. Make the INK invisible in the clues not in the grid. Duh. O.K. so I have a pretty simple word game. You can convert one of this puzzle’s six theme answers into an equally viable answer for the same clue by altering (no adding or subtracting) just one letter. Can you figure it out? I’ll post the answer on XWord Info. Good luck!So let that be a lesson to all you aspiring constructors out there: When in doubt swap the clues for the entries. You never know what might work.Mr. Polin and I both agreed that a good video for this post would be a certain scene from Monty Python’s “Life of Brian” that speaks of “derring-do.” Unfortunately that scene is not standards-friendly but you are more than welcome to look it up. It features Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate and Graham Chapman as his friend with the name that cannot be written here.Since we can’t post that bit of hilarity let’s go in the opposite direction and listen to the actor and director ANDRE Gregory tell Wallace Shawn about reality in the 1981 film “My Dinner With ANDRE.”Your thoughts?

9,Bulgaria will hold elections in six months to replace Parliament which has been dominated by former Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov's unpopular Socialist Party reports today indicated. The trade union newspaper Trud quoted President Zhelyu Zhelev a non-Communist as saying that a May date for elections was set as part of an agreement reached between Mr. Lukanov and other political leaders before the premier resigned on Thursday.
1,1. Markets suffered through another day of losses prompting Christine Lagarde the head of the International Monetary Fund to offer a cautious assessment of the world’s economy. “Asia as a region is still expected to lead global growth” she said on a visit to Indonesia. “But even here the pace is turning out slower than expected.”The Dow the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq all closed down nearly 3 percent.
9,TWO hotels are already operating adjacent to the PNC Bank site and three more are nearing completion nearby part of an 80-acre site dubbed Airport Interplex. Extended Stay America is adding 140 rooms and will be joined by a 140-room Hampton Inn and a Studio Plus property with 85 rooms said Jerry Segal senior vice president of Korman Commercial Properties Inc. Other off-airport lodging includes Embassy Suites Marriott Westin and Days Inn.''These are replacing lots of rooms that were very old said Mr. Segal. ''They can support the convention center because they're so close to downtown with the Eastwick rail station.''Michael G. French a principal with Coopers & Lybrand LLP in Philadelphia said aging hotels near the airport and the nearby sports complex have been renovated thanks to capital programs by hotel chains like Promus Corp. and HFS which recently purchased properties or chains that own hotels there.''The airport market in Philadelphia even in the worst of times always operated at healthier occupancy levels than Center City or other surrounding markets largely because for a long time it was under-supplied compared to other airport markets'' said Mr. French.''In 1991-92 the hotels were being operated by asset managers on behalf of banks or going through restructurings but even then the airport markets did well. The average occupancy is close to 80 percent and for that market it's at capacity because things are always soft on Sunday nights. Commercial travelers are increasingly inclined to come in have a meeting and get out.''In 1996 the Airport Council International reported Philadelphia had 1.6 million inbound and outbound international travelers a 27 percent gain over the year before. And US Airways the dominant airline serving Philadelphia intends to improve both its service and facilities here. Nevertheless many Philadelphia-area travelers depart from Newark or New York airports because of a limited number of international departures.Construction is under way in two of the airport's five terminals to add moving sidewalks and a 45000-square-foot retail mall. In addition the airport has announced a $300 million expansion of its international terminal. And US Airways has disclosed plans for a new commuter-flight facility the addition of flights to Amsterdam and increased service to Frankfurt Rome London and Paris among other destinations.

1,KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia — In highway billboards and radio announcements the government of Malaysia is warning of a new enemy: “fake news.”On Monday the lower house of Parliament passed a bill outlawing fake news the first measure of its kind in the world. The proposal which allows for up to six years in prison for publishing or circulating misleading information is expected to pass the Senate this week and to come into effect soon after.The legislation would punish not only those who are behind fake news but also anyone who maliciously spreads such material. Online service providers would be responsible for third-party content and anyone could lodge a complaint. As long as Malaysia or Malaysians are affected fake news generated outside the country is also subject to prosecution.What qualifies as fake news however is ill defined. Ultimately the government would be given broad latitude to decide what constitutes fact in Malaysia.

8,Can New York City's Board of Education do anything right? It has a dismal record on counting dropouts. It stands by while hundreds of homeless children also go school-less. It has allowed the search for a chancellor to drag on for months. The board badly needs a victory and a prime opportunity now presents itself: contract negotiations with school custodians.Over the years school officials have ceded control of the 1000 school buildings to custodians who operate both as city employees and independent contractors. They receive an allocation from which they pay other workers and purchase supplies. That might make sense if the custodians were held accountable for the condition of schools. But the supervisors who oversee and rate them for promotions now belong to the same union. Custodians are required to clean schools only every other day. Frustrated principals complain that custodians refuse minor maintenance like changing light bulbs or fixing broken toilets.More they are allowed to charge ''opening fees'' to outside groups for use of classrooms gymnasiums and other school facilities during non-class hours a privilege that helps bring their average annual salary to $50000.City Council President Andrew Stein rightly denounces this astonishing arrangement as ''legalized extortion.'' Robert Wagner Jr. president of the Board of Education says he is determined to ''reclaim control of the schools.'' Doing so will require dramatic and fundamental change. At a minimum district and borough managers need to be removed from the custodians' union and made directly accountable to the board and principals need the authority to order maintenance work directly from their schools' custodians. Reducing or eliminating opening fees is essential to after-hours and weekend programs that benefit whole neighborhoods.

1,PhotoAs erratically enjoyable as it is consistently ridiculous the martial arts pastiche “The Man With the Iron Fists” is the latest evidence that the vogue for neo-exploitation cinema shows no sign of flagging. Directed by the hip-hop impresario turned would-be auteur RZA (a k a Robert Diggs) of the group Wu-Tang Clan “Iron Fists” is a sweetly sincere lightly cheeky gloss on the film genre wuxia (“martial chivalry”) and those entertainments known for their flying swordsmen (and women) crouching tigers hidden dragons and often fabulous hair gowns and wirework. This is a movie as drenched in genre love as it is in the arterial spray from its hordes of sliced and diced characters.It can be hard to separate knowing neo-exploitation cinema from just plain dreck and really there seems little point in doing so. Once upon a time so-called respectable films opened in certain theaters and the putative dross of the type churned out by the producer Samuel Z. Arkoff opened elsewhere. Those divisions between high and low are long gone demolished by vanguard directors like Dennis Hopper and more recently by filmmaker-pasticheurs like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez who draw on exploitation cinema as enthusiastically as they do on classic Hollywood and art film. The apex of their geek fandom was Mr. Tarantino’s “Death Proof” and Mr. Rodriguez’s “Planet Terror” which were packaged in the United States as a double feature titled “Grindhouse.”Photo“The Man With the Iron Fists” is like those films the progeny of a deep cinephile passion if rather shakier filmmaking skills. Shot in China though as supremely artificial-looking as a Hollywood (or Hong Kong) backlot it mostly takes place in a fictional feudal town Jungle Village at the juncture of King Hu and Sergio Leone filmmakers whose shadows loom heavily over the movie. It’s here that Western name actors notably Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu rub elbows and clashing accents with Asian talent like Daniel Wu and Gordon Liu in a knotted story involving the usual mad grab for power and gold. Lucy Liu plays Madam Blossom who runs a flamboyantly amusingly smutty pinked-up brothel packed with smiling lovelies who look like an Orientalist fantasy by way of Victoria’s Secret.In a misguided move RZA has cast himself as the narrator and story hub a character known with a touch of wit only as the Blacksmith. A hardworking soul the Blacksmith makes weapons for the local warring clans squirreling away his money so that he can leave town with Lady Silk (Jamie Chung). The Blacksmith’s pungent history — told in flashback and buoyed by a brief appearance from Pam Grier — could itself be spun off into a separate movie. It’s an obviously pivotal role that should have real juice. But RZA with his sleepy eyes and an affect so laid-back it’s a wonder he can remain standing for minutes at a time is too recessive a screen presence to make the character pop much less hold your interest.To his credit he has tapped some professional scene stealers including Mr. Crowe and a diverting ByronMann as Silver Lion a gaudy baddie with heavy-metal hair and a psycho grin. Mr. Crowe who swans about as a rogue called Jack Knife looks amused throughout and it’s no wonder since about all he has to do is bed multiple women and gut an occasional foe in a movie that can feel like a private party. Which in some ways it is: Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu appeared in Mr. Tarantino’s epic “Kill Bill” to which RZA contributed music. Mr. Tarantino has returned the favor by lending his brand to “Iron Fists” as its “presenter.” RZA wrote the movie’s screenplay with Eli Roth of “Hostel” franchise notoriety who appeared as the bat-wielding American soldier in Mr. Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds.”It’s a small fanboy world after all.“The Man With the Iron Fists” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gore galore.
0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students learn about federally funded abstinence-only sex education. Then in groups students create age-appropriate informational brochures examining health topics relating to sex.Author(s):Annissa Hambouz The New York Times Learning NetworkAndrea Perelman The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Consider positive and negative aspects of abstinence-only sex education programs.2. Examine current federal policy and funding for abstinence-only sex education curricula in schools.3. Brainstorm research and create brochures about health issues relating to sex.4. Write reflective papers examining the value of sex education curricula for their particular age group.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils-paper-copies of “Abstinence-Only: Does It Work?” (one per student)-resources about health issues related to sex (health and science textbooks computers with Internet access)-cardstock paper for informational brochures (optional)Activities / Procedures:NOTE TO TEACHER: As with all controversial subjects the topic of sex education should be approached with great sensitivity. Please adjust the content of this lesson plan if necessary to suit your school’s curriculum standards and policies as well as students’ level of awareness and understanding.1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Ask students to respond to the following question written on the board prior to class: “What are the pros and cons of ‘abstinence-only’ sex education?” Allow time for students to consider the question and then record their answers on the board. For reference create a chart illustrating the ‘pros’ and ‘cons.’2. As a class read and discuss “Abstinence-Only: Does It Work?” using the following questions:a. What approach to sex education must school receiving federal funding take?b. How does an “abstinence-only” sex education curriculum account for the discussion of contraception?c. According to the article why might abstinence-only sex education be unrealistic?d. Who is Cynthia Dailard and what is her position on abstinence-only sex education?e. What are some of the studies mentioned in the article and what were their results?f. What analogy does Tobe Goldberg make to describe her perspective on abstinence-only education?g. According to the article why might some teenagers’ definition of sex cause problems?h. When and how did abstinence-only sex education begin in the United States?i. How much federal funding has abstinence-only education received since 1996?j. How much did abstinence-only education receive this year?k. How much federal funding for abstinence-only has President Bush requested for 2005?l. How many children born in the United States have teenage mothers according to the article?m. According to the article how does the rate of teenage pregnancy in the United States compare to other developed countries?n. How does the rate of sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents in the United States compare to other countries?o. According to the article how many sexually active teenagers will contract an S.T.D. by the time they are 18?p. What did President Bush mean when he said that “abstinence works every time” and to whom did he make that statement?q. According to the American Psychological Association study cited by Ms. Dailard what percentage of college students who had pledged virginity in their earlier years had broken their vow to remain abstinent until marriage?3. Explain to students that they will be working in groups to create informational brochures exploring specific health issues related to sex. Ask students to brainstorm a list of research topics while you note them on the board. Some ideas mentioned in the article “Abstinence-Only: Does It Work?” include S.T.D.’s pregnancy and methods of contraception.Ultimately the list should include topics such as: the transmission physical symptoms and effects of a specific sexually transmitted disease (such as gonorrhea syphilis H.I.V. or H.P.V.); pregnancy (from conception to birth); the risks associated with non-intercourse sexual activity; and how different methods of contraception work to prevent pregnancy or transmission of disease if appropriate for your curriculum (see NOTE TO TEACHER above).Divide students into small groups and ask each group to select a topic from the list written on the board. Each group’s topic should be approved prior to researching to avoid overlap of subject matter and ensure appropriateness within the curriculum. Encourage students to research information from reputable sources of health information such as health and science textbooks and local national and international organizations without specific biases or political agendas.Once research is completed groups should review their notes and begin outlining their brochure. Encourage students to divide tasks evenly to ensure equitable contributions to the project.4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Groups should work cooperatively to complete their brochures which will be presented in a future class. Individually students prepare written reflections about the importance of sex education. What should be included in a sex education curriculum for your peers? Why? What should not be included? Why?In a future class groups present their brochures to the class and discuss the value of sex education curricula.Further Questions for Discussion:–What is your own personal opinion of abstinence-only sex education? Why do you feel this way?–Do you think schools that choose to offer information on contraception should still receive federal funding? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on contributions to class discussions completion of group research and brochure about a particular health issue pertaining to sex and thoughtfully written reflection papers.Vocabulary:advocate improbable refrains S.T.D. ample refute premise adequate nonprofit reproductive contraception incidence pledged virginity interim fiscal condom ineffective use-effectivenessExtension Activities:1. Create a survey asking your fellow students about your school’s sex education program. Do they feel as if they receive too much sufficient or not enough information? Publish your results in an article for the school (or local) newspaper.2. Investigate one of the studies mentioned in the article “Abstinence-Only: Does It Work?” Read and analyze the study then create a presentation to be given during class. What type of methodology did the researchers use? How large was the sample population? What were some of the results?3. Make a glossary of terms with which you think teens should be familiar regarding health hygiene and sexuality.Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics- Write a research paper examining the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. Aside from offering matching funds to states with abstinence-only curricula in their schools what are some of the other goals or purposes for this legislation? Research the history passing and implementation of this act.Economics- If President Bush receives the requested $273 million for abstinence-only education in the 2005 fiscal year what percentage of federal education funding will that be? How does it compare to other components of the federal budget?Global History- Create a poster illustrating some of the health-related sex issues faced in a country other than your own. Include information about who is affected (both directly and indirectly) reasons why this issue exists in this particular country and what the country or global community is doing to help change this problem.Media Studies- Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban’s 2004 film “Saved!” satirizes evangelical Christianity among American teenagers and addresses issues of teenage sexuality and pregnancy. Screen the film with a group of your classmates and organize a post-film discussion.Other Information on the Web:New York Times Learning Network Issue in Depth: Teen Pregnancy (//www.nytimes.com/learning/issues_in_depth/20040503.html) provides a large number of Times articles from 2000 to today exploring issues of sex education in schools.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Health Standard 1- Knows the availability and effective use of health services products and information.

1,Eric MartinForget waxed mustaches plaid thermoses and suspenders. The new men’s-wear label Jon Ashe is bringing back a sleeker and more understated version of heritage chic. “You have to strike a balance between being innovative and tribal” says Jonas Hegewisch who designs the fledgling collection. His idea of “tribal” doesn’t include far-flung ethnic influences. He’s talking about belonging to a social “tribe” as in Williamsburg hipsters or corporate America. “The aesthetic that appeals to me has a certain rustic quality” explains Hegewisch who is originally from Germany. (Before starting Jon Ashe he collaborated with his wife Ursula on Wearkstatt a fashion-forward bridal business; he also owned Trailer Park one of Berlin’s coolest biergartens.) “But I try to bring different elements together.”Those elements include formal suiting and vintage worker‘s uniforms. Meticulously tailored but stripped of all padding the Jon Ashe look is perhaps best described as falling somewhere between dandy and 1930s construction worker. All of the garments are produced in New York City; the high-end fabrics are sourced from small mills in Britain (tweed) Italy (cashmere) and Japan (cotton). Horn buttons come from Austria and custom-made leather belts are from Ohio.But the real strength of the collection lies in the precise but easy-to-wear silhouettes. “Being comfortabIe puts you in a better mood” Hegewisch says. “I spend a lot of time looking at people to see what makes them look happy. Happy people are more attractive.” It only makes sense then that Jon Ashe a bohemian who doubles as the designer’s alter ego (the name is derived from the first letters of Hegewisch’s own) is the happiest man of all. The imaginary muse is a Vespa-riding Brooklyner whose enviable life consists of cruising around the New York harbor in his small yacht sipping artisanal cocktails and playing drums in a “frock band” (a style yet to be defined). “It’s the life I hope to have one day if my collection takes off” Hegewisch says. “So he’s a motivation as well as an inspiration.”At the end of September Mr. Ashe will get his very own headquarters. Hegewisch is currently putting the finishing touches on a flagship store on the corner of Grand and Crosby Streets.

9,Just as there is a thread that joins the new school designers in Paris so there has blossomed a common spirit among the younger generation of designers in New York which sets them apart from America's old guard.Even if one did not know Cynthia Rowley Susan Lazar Jill Stuart or Donna Haag one could likely correctly guess their age group: in their 30's. There is a giddy informality in their design that one would not expect to find in the work of say a Bill Blass Donna Karan or Ralph Lauren who have come to stand for sober immortal clothes.For many younger designers now clothes seem alive for the moment vibrating with disposable chic. It is an air that both Ms. Lazar and Ms. Stuart expressed well for spring. Ms. Rowley while inhabiting the same universe was not as successful.Her design locomotive was out of control with no clearly discernible direction evident amid her wide-legged trouser suits long awning-stripe dresses ruffled asymmetrical dresses and coat jackets over slim pants.
9,Like many other communities across the region and the nation this affluent suburban village of 9000 in northern Westchester County has been struggling for a decade to adapt to an influx of Hispanic immigrants many of them ill-educated day laborers from impoverished villages in Central America. The Hispanic population here grew from 5 percent in 1980 to about 12 percent in 1990 according to the census.One question for the courts will be whether the town discriminated against them. In the last three years the United States Justice Department has sued towns in Illinois New Jersey and New Mexico alleging that they violated fair housing laws by using zoning and housing codes to exclude Latin Americans.In Mount Kisco the friction between longtime residents many of Italian and Irish descent and the Spanish-speaking newcomers has created feelings of loss and anger on both sides roiling the idyllic surface of this picturesque town.'We Want Our Town Back'It was a letter to the editor of The Patent Trader published in September 1994 that crystallized the anger of many town residents about the presence of the Hispanic immigrants in their midst.Linda Skiba and Beth Vetare Civitello wrote that they would risk being called prejudiced to draw attention to what they saw as the deterioration of ''the once bucolic Village/Town of Mount Kisco that we have always loved.''''The overwhelming amount of incidents that involve intoxicated persons should be alerting us to a major problem'' they wrote. ''Check the police records concerning arrests made involving Hispanics (for lack of a better term); undocumented or legal either driving while intoxicated or throwing beer bottles or tearing street signs out of the ground or knifing one another.''In conclusion they wrote ''We want our town back!''At the Sept. 26 meeting of the town's Board of Trustees Richard T. Roth a Republican who was then Mayor read the letter aloud. Residents complained that too many Hispanic men were loitering on street corners drinking and urinating in public and living in overcrowded housing.
9,These are huge tasks not least because they require an assault on the C.I.A.'s anachronistic culture and its belief inherited from the cold war that it alone knows what's best for the country. That belief is largely responsible for the contempt in which the C.I.A. holds Congress and the conviction that anything goes including evading the law and the Constitution.Opening the C.I.A. to public inspection -- or at least Congressional inspection -- is critical. And openness begins with the budget. The intelligence budget unlike all other budgets is largely secret. This allows the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies to escape public justification for what they're doing. Mr. Woolsey can begin by publishing the budget -- attaching real numbers to specific agencies and broad functions.The overall intelligence budget -- which includes the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency -- is an estimated $29 billion. It may be more. Either way it's excessive. The resources devoted to the Soviet problem dropped from half the 1990 budget to slightly more than a third for the coming year. But the overall budget has been reduced by just a fraction. Surely other intelligence requirements cannot absorb the remaining billions.Many career officers insist that deeper cuts will leave America deaf and blind. Yet money isn't the problem; the C.I.A. was rolling in money when it failed to predict the revolution in Iran and grossly overestimated the strength of the Soviet economy and later the strength of the Iraqi Army.The real problem lies in the way the C.I.A. has traditionally concocted its intelligence assessments. These are inevitably a product of a committee of bureaucrats with vested interests in their programs budgets and pet theories with ears attuned to what top officials want to hear. What emerges is often mush.

9,But when a company like Hotmail with no real revenue to speak of is sold for $400 million other companies may feel like failures in comparison -- even when they are sold for three to five times the amount their investors put into them.In the pre-Internet days a return of five times invested capital would have been terrific. But venture capitalists like myself will be judged not only by the absolute dollars we return to our investors or the internal rate of return on the capital invested but against our peers many of whom have seen $2 million investments turn into $1 billion in value in three to five years -- thanks to those runaway stock prices.This unrealistic comparison threatens the foundations of one of the most remarkable constructs of a capitalist economy. The business of venture capital providing growth financing to entrepreneurs in exchange for equity in fledgling or semi-established companies can be a superb engine of economic growth creating an enormous number of jobs and fueling an entrepreneurial spirit essential to a healthy economy.But when a company with no visible means of support let alone a plan to generate revenue sells for $400 million even normally sharp-witted venture capitalists lose their minds. In a mad scramble they start outbidding each other to provide capital to what they hope will be the next Hotmail. So what? Who gets hurt? The entrepreneurs.I know one chief executive who has worked day and night for three years to build his Internet software company. He has suffered through all of the dysfunction and pain of nurturing a start-up. This year in the first full year of selling his product his company is the No. 1 or No. 2 player in the market (depending on which research report you believe) he has more than 1200 customers and has expected annual revenues of $3.5 million to $4 million. And he may turn cash flow positive sometime in the fall. Not bad by anyone's measure right? Wrong.He thinks he has failed. Given the economics of the software industry the likely exit scenario for this company is a sale to another software company. The likely price will be somewhere just below $50 million. But if that happens the chief executive told me he will have failed.And so will his investors. After three or fours years of work he will walk away with ''only'' $2 million to $3 million. And the investors will see a return of ''only'' 200 percent to 300 percent. So to avoid the perceived failure he will probably choose to hang on longer than he should in pursuit of a market that simply may not be big enough to support his enterprise as a stand-alone company. And he and his investors instead of cashing in will sit at the table too long and possibly walk away with nothing.John Doerr a much better-known and wealthier venture capitalist than I is often quoted as saying that the Internet represents the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. So far Internet stocks seem to be proving him right. For my part I just hope he is not the yardstick against which we will all be measured.

8,Much of her day is spent with a phone warming her ear. Miss Ivory says there is no approved list of callers who are automatically put through to him but she has picked up on the people he always talks to. Many of the callers are C.E.O.'s. ''It's sort of like a fraternity'' she says. ''You recognize other C.E.O.'s. You always give them every courtesy. . . . It can be days or weeks before a call gets returned. Sometimes - it happens rather frequently - one of the C.E.O.'s or Mr. Waldron gets on the phone and there's dead silence. Neither one knows who's calling whom or what they're calling about.''One of her regular duties she goes on is to advise Waldron twice a day - at 11 A.M. and at 4 P.M. - of Avon's stock price on the New York Stock Exchange. How does he react? ''When it's down'' she says ''he'll be mad. He'll say 'Goddamn it down again.' ''WALDRON SHUFFLES through papers. It is afternoon. He says he has more work than he can keep up with. He says the problems at the beauty business are worse than he anticipated.''I know we have to hit bottom'' he says. ''I know there is a figure called minus 100. Sooner or later we have to hit bottom.'' He says that he occasionally begins to feel as if he is adrift in some alien world. ''Sometimes you find it hard to believe that you're looking at those numbers over there'' and he points to a chart of a downward sloping red line ''and then you're having coffee over here with the Twenty-Five Year Club one of those wonderful things I have to do. Sometimes it just doesn't seem to make a bit of sense.''Shouldn't he be spending more of his time all of his time on the beauty business?''There's an awful temptation to become preoccupied with a major artery severing'' he says. ''You have to resist it. You have such responsibilities. If someone is going to sit in that chair'' -he motions toward his chair - ''and call himself a leader he has to be a full-time leader and be a consistent leader and not cry or laugh or fly off the handle when that's not the right thing to do. Anyone who lets a personal problem or a business problem get to him and interfere with how he runs the company is not doing the job the way it ought to be done. So you have to go out to the dinners and look after the other children in the family and laugh and slap backs even though you know there's an engine fire going.''IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT C.E.O.'s are overly preoccupied with short-term considerations that they are obsessed with what the bottom line will show three to six months in the future and with making those numbers bigger and bigger at any cost.''There is a fixation'' Waldron tells me one day. ''And I think it's terribly unhealthy. I have the sickness too.'' He pins the blame on securities analysts who he says ''you can't get to think ahead more than six months. Some you can't get past the present quarter. Now why is that the case? . . . Companies like our own have money managers . . . We bring these money managers in and put them through terrible torture once or twice a year. How's our money doing? And if they say it's gone phsssst then we say 'O.K. you've got one more quarter or we replace you with someone else.' And they scamper out and say 'We've got to find some stocks that are going to go up.' So I think that's what's driving American business. . . .''

9,A new political skirmish broke out in the Senate today again delaying a vote on midyear budget cuts and prompting an exasperated majority leader Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to threaten political war against the White House."We're not bringing up any more bills that the White House wants until we have some understanding on the legislation that we thought would go through here in a normal way" Mr. Dole said suggesting that President Clinton was orchestrating Democratic efforts to slow work in the Senate. "If the President doesn't care that's good enough for me. If he doesn't want this legislation we're not going to take it up. But neither are we going to take up legislation that he wants."As Mr. Dole issued his warning Mr. Clinton fired off a letter from Haiti where he spent the day chiding the majority leader for not having passed legislation that would give the military $2.5 billion in an emergency appropriation to cover the costs of operations in Haiti Somalia and elsewhere.But any hopes of a quick vote on that bill or the separate midyear budget cuts were further dimmed when a partisan fight erupted over taxation of multimillionaires who are expatriates.
1,His tenure has been dogged though by suggestions of uneasy relationships with some of his players — most notably Messi — and by accusations that his coaching style does not follow the elegant template laid down at Barcelona by Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola. His meetings with Catalonia’s ravenous news media have also been consistently fractious.Enrique had warned Robert Fernández Barcelona’s sporting director before this season that he might not sign the new contract the club was prepared to offer him. Discussions over that deal had stalled in recent months and it is quite likely that Enrique’s announcement that he would step down did not come as a shock to the club.Barcelona now has three months to identify the most suitable replacement. Ernesto Valverde the experienced coach of Athletic Bilbao has considerable support among Barcelona’s executives as well as his own Barcelona connection: He won the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup as a player for the club in 1989. That his Athletic side beat Barcelona in this season’s Spanish Super Cup could add weight to his case.Jorge Sampaoli the coach of Sevilla is the other leading contender. In his first job in European soccer Sampaoli has turned Sevilla into a genuine contender for the Spanish title and the expansive playing style he prefers is seen by some as dovetailing neatly with Barcelona’s traditions.Sampaoli is also on the cusp of qualifying for the quarterfinals of the Champions League something Barcelona — which was beaten 4-0 in the first leg of its round of 16 matchup with Paris St.-Germain — is unlikely to do.

0,From Greenwich to East Hampton on private helicopter pools ferrying investment bankers into town from Long Island's South Fork and in the steam room of Park Avenue's Racquet Club the cognoscenti can readily recognize one familiar facet of the tale of Martha Stewart and her friend the now-former biotechnology chief executive Samuel D. Waksal: they were entwined in a Manhattan grapevine where the exchange of corporate information is a burgeoning social custom not necessarily a crime.In Manhattan and its environs friendships like theirs often coincide with business relationships. And where power access and social advantage intersect information that most Americans would think of as exceedingly privileged is passed at cocktail parties and over linen-clad dinner tables as casually as canapés.In the latest case however investigators are asking whether a few social figures went over the line. On June 12 Dr. Waksal then chief executive of ImClone Systems was arrested on charges of insider trading. Ms. Stewart's actions are being examined in several investigations. She and Dr. Waksal say they did nothing illegal or wrong.Insider trading is the buying or selling of securities for personal gain with the knowing use of confidential information. While the whispers of the moneyed crowd are not usually the kind of information that will send its purveyors away in federally issued orange jumpsuits the chattering classes do trade data on the subtle level of plain old sociability.

1,Kostas Tsironis/Bloomberg NewsThe restructuring of Greece’s debt that is scheduled to start next week may well demonstrate how effective credit-default swaps are.These financial instruments which played a major role in both the 2008 financial crisis and in the European debt crisis are meant to pay out if a company or country defaults. But the twists and turns over Greece’s debt are revealing their potential limitations for investors who hope the swaps will protect them against losses if Greece defaults.On Thursday the International Swaps and Derivatives Association the industry body that decides whether swaps should pay out said that Greece’s proposed debt exchange did not currently activate swaps linked to the country’s debt. But the association added that the swaps could activate at a later date.The body’s decision reignites the debate over the usefulness of the default swaps. If Greece had simply stopped paying interest or principal on its bonds the swaps would have paid out. European policy makers however decided last year to try to use a voluntary debt exchange for Greece as a way to avoid setting off the swaps. The maneuver was a brusque reminder for investors that there are ways to circumvent the conditions of credit-default swaps.“If a sovereign and those trying to rescue it tiptoe around the periphery to avoid triggering the C.D.S. it may impair the effectiveness of the C.D.S. as a risk management tool” said Bruce Bennett a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling.If the Greek debt exchange damages the reputation of credit-default swaps banks and other investors that make heavy use of them for protection from losses may have to consider other strategies.And it would add fuel to the political fire over the swaps and speculators. Some European politicians contend that the swaps destabilize financial markets and encourage investors to mount speculative attacks on government debt. European officials have even taken the step of setting up their own version of credit protection which will be offered by the European Financial Stability Facility a government-backed rescue fund.Just over $70 billion of default swaps exist on Greek government debt. After subtracting swaps that pay out on a default from those that get paid the net amount is $3.25 billion. But the small net number masks how much is at stake if the swaps do not behave after Greece’s debt exchange as investors planned.One of the decisions of the swaps association on Thursday underscored how swaps can be disconnected from actions that harm investors’ economic interests. As part of the Greek debt deal the European Central Bank will be shielded against losses on the Greek bonds it holds a move that relegates or subordinates the claims of private creditors who hold the same bonds.But the swaps association said the plans to subordinate private creditors do not meet the definition of subordination in the swaps contracts so they do not have to pay out. The association’s 15-member committee behind the decision consists of 10 banks that deal in derivatives and five asset management firms.Most analysts now believe that Greece will opt for an involuntary exchange using a legal measure to force as many bondholders into the exchange as possible to maximize the country’s debt relief. As a result many market participants believe the swaps will be set off.A voluntary exchange is still possible however. If more than 90 percent of the bondholders entered the exchange voluntarily Greece might decide it does not need to force more participation with the legal measure called a collective action clause.But even if Greece does opt for an involuntary exchange and the swaps activate the process may not work as planned. The exact amount paid out on the swaps is determined by an auction of Greek bonds. Yet the auction would almost certainly take place after the bonds had been included in the exchange and eradicated. Investors have to submit bonds registered under Greek law by Thursday.After the exchange investors would have new Greek bonds worth much less than their old bonds’ original value. But it is not clear whether these can be included in the default swaps auction and if they can whether they would settle at the price investors hoped for.Some analysts say that the swaps association will most likely try to work out a solution so that the new bonds can be used in the auction.“I am convinced I.S.D.A. will come up with a mechanism” said Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal a lecturer in finance at the University of London who specializes in sovereign debt.If that option does not exist another potential solution may be to use the small amount of Greek bonds that are registered under English law in the auction. Holders of these bonds may not submit them by Thursday. And they will not be subject to the collective action clause which is only inserted in Greek law bonds.The English law bonds will almost certainly lose value but they do not have to be submitted to Greece until April 11. That means some may theoretically be available for the default swap auction. Still this option raises the question of what would happen if Greece did not have any English law bonds.Some analysts do not see anxiety in the market prices for Greek bonds and credit-default swaps. A big divergence between the two instruments would suggest investors are worried about their ability to activate the default swaps. But that is not happening said Ed Lalanne a strategist at Macro Risk Advisers.“The prices of sovereign C.D.S haven’t been condemning the market to be useless” he said.

1,WASHINGTON — President Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has contradicted Mr. Trump’s rationale for firing James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director saying he was dismissed because he would not say publicly what he had told the president privately: that Mr. Trump was not under scrutiny in the Russia investigation at the time.“He fired Comey because Comey would not among other things say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation” Mr. Giuliani said in an interview late Wednesday with Sean Hannity of Fox News. “He’s entitled to that.”Mr. Giuliani’s assertion contradicted the myriad explanations that the president and his aides have given for the firing and was the first public acknowledgment by a Trump adviser for what Mr. Comey has maintained: that he was fired for his handling of the Russia investigation.At the time of Mr. Comey’s dismissal last May both Mr. Trump and his aides cited his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and his decision to say publicly during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mrs. Clinton the Democratic candidate would not be charged with a crime.

9,HONDA ACCORD EX V6 Honda's bread-and-butter midsize car just keeps getting better. Like the boomers who've been buying it for more than 20 years it has matured and expanded trading youthful exuberance for staid middle age.The latest sixth-generation Accord introduced last fall is significant in many ways: It is longer taller significantly roomier and more powerful than the previous car. This Accord was designed specifically for American tastes and it is built only in Ohio with 97 percent of its parts American-made. The coupe and the sedan share virtually no exterior parts except their headlights. And the number of components was reduced by 15 percent keeping prices in check.While the ultraconservative lines of the Accord sedan were drawn in Japan the coupe's somewhat more liberal styling sprang from Honda's Ohio development center. The front end is generic Honda (which these days looks a lot like generic Toyota) and a flowing roof line tapers back toward the most daring feature a high back end with a huge bumper and a fender-to-fender reflective panel that evokes the NSX from Acura Honda's luxury division.Engines have long been Honda's forte and the company has outdone itself again. The four-cylinder power plant has been reworked and enlarged from 2.2 to 2.3 liters. Because of its variable valve timing -- a complex bit of magic with which the opening of the intake valves changes based on the engine speed for optimal combustion -- it is peppy superefficient and so clean that the car qualifies as a low-emission vehicle in all 50 states. Indeed the EX model sold in California is the first gas-powered car to meet stricter ultra-low-emission standards.The four-cylinder ought to please most people but the power-hungry have an alternative: a new 3-liter 200-horsepower V6 that also has variable valve timing -- a first for a V6. It idles in silence and accelerates with silky easy athleticism. But put your foot down and it revs freely to 6000 r.p.m. and beyond. Alas the four-speed automatic -- a good smooth one to be sure -- only flirts with the engine's capabilities and a five-speed manual doesn't come with the V6.Of course Honda knows that sporty-car types will look instead to the Prelude and that style mavens will consider the Acura CL -- a car that shares much with the Accord coupe including its engines. If this oh-so-mainstream coupe has a distinct lack of personality it is partly by design.No complaints though about the way it drives or rides. The handling was stable and predictable even in driving rain and severe winds but the suspension would rather comfort your backside than hug the curves. And while the Accord rides rather well there was enough wind hum -- granted during a spell of nasty windy weather -- that it seemed incongruous in the opulent cabin.
9,It may be as late as game time tomorrow night against the Devils before we find out the fate of the Rangers. Unless the National Hockey League's Owners' Assembly votes to allow the Rangers to trade Adam Graves and Brian Leetch for Wayne Gretzky we might as well kiss the Cup goodbye.Call this the longest day. One can only imagine the promises and payoffs flying around like loose pucks. On one side is the so-called Ice-Agers the traditional old guard of Canadian-oriented owners led by Toronto and Montreal who believe that a championship in New York will anchor the league against the rising tide of parvenu glitz-kriegers who want to turn it into a white N.B.A.On the other side is the so-called Seven Dwarfs the progressive new franchises who want to make the N.H.L. a truly modern major league. The Dwarfs are led by the Disney Mighty Ducks and the Blockbuster Panthers. They are politicking for the votes of the so-called Snowblowers who have so far stayed out of the fray -- like hockey players who spray ice when they brake sharply at the first sign of trouble.To permit this extraordinary trade after the league's regular deadline requires a two-thirds vote by the Assembly a semisecret group that meets only in special session and then only on issues that affect the survival of the sport.

8,The United States has received a private response to American messages sent to Iran Administration officials said today and Secretary of State George P. Shultz indicated his willingness to meet with Iran's Foreign Minister if the Iranians asked for such a meeting.The message from Iran and Mr. Shultz's comments in a television interview suggested an intensification of signals between the two countries in recent days that could create a climate for an improvement in relations.An Administration official said today that the message from Iran was channeled through a third party that the official declined to identify. ''There's basically no change in their position'' the official said referring to the Iranian message. ''It's basically the same as their public position.''The official said the United States had not responded to the message. Statement by ReaganThe message was received late last week after President Reagan said that the United States was ready to discuss the American hostages in Lebanon if the leaders of Iran were ''willing and ready to talk.'' But the official said that the Iranian message appeared to have been prompted by a communication sent to Iran by the United States welcoming Teheran's acceptance of a United Nations cease-fire resolution.

1,IT’S common practice for companies to inject new products with a frisson of dare by naming them for gutsy pursuits or enticing destinations. But a Rolex Submariner may never plumb the ocean’s depths and a Kia Sedona won’t always be traversing red-rock landscapes in Arizona.The Honda Africa Twin comes by its name honestly though. The motorcycle is a go-anywhere adventure bike that is the consumer-market descendant of a racing machine with a heroic résumé.The original Africa Twin made its reputation by surviving among other perils thousands of miles of African desert and mountains to win the brutal Paris-Dakar Rally four times in the 1980s. (Because of terrorist attacks the off-road race moved to South America in 2009 and is now called the Dakar.)While a devoted following for the civilian version of the Africa Twin grew the model never came to the United States and the name fell into disuse more than a dozen years ago.

0,This summer the bookstore chain Borders is starting a program to apply the market research techniques of the grocery store business to the sales of novels and nonfiction books. One of its first lessons may be that comparing books to frozen foods is a sure way to raise the ire of authors regardless of the details.Last week Ralph Nader Noam Chomsky and 26 other authors signed a letter to the chairman of Borders Gregory P. Josefowicz arguing that the new program called category management would hurt small publishers and narrow the stores' selection. Their main gripe was that Borders invited publishers -- for fees that can reportedly run more than $100000 -- to be ''category captains'' for each of 250 categories from cookbooks to thrillers.Learning of the program Mr. Nader and the authors began to fear that the sponsoring publishers would effectively control the shelves at the stores at the expense of others promoting their own books over those from smaller publishers and reducing the variety of titles sold.''There is a difference between books and Pop-Tarts'' the letter warned. ''Leave the category management to the soap merchants.''

1,In the 1950s some jazz musicians believed they couldn’t get that Charlie Parker “happy-sad feeling without using drugs.” So says a friend of the saxophonist Frank Morgan in “Sound of Redemption” a documentary that revels in the happy despite some seriously sad events.Mr. Morgan was born into music. His father was a professional musician who used to play his guitar while pressing it against the belly of his pregnant wife and later played by his son’s crib. Mr. Morgan was an accomplished saxophonist by the time he was a teenager; it’s said that when he performed with Billie Holiday his music made her cry.His renown grew as did an addiction to heroin. His drug habit was soon financed by crime and for some 30 years he was in and out of prison. After his last stint he was released and went on to record some of his finest work.The film directed by N.C. Heikin traces Mr. Morgan’s career with beautiful black-and-white photographs and newsreels. Those scenes are intertwined with segments from a 2012 tribute concert at San Quentin prison in California five years after his death.

9,The ODC/San Francisco modern dance troupe clearly spent a great deal of time and money on ''Outawak'' a spectacular multimedia computer fable that opened on Tuesday for a week's engagement at the Joyce Theater. Dancers spill out across a set-strewn stage dressed in a variety of costumes whose bright colors give the dancers the look of Liquorice Allsorts. There are scrims and screens galore on which are projected bridges a church steeple clouds and members of the cast. And ''Outawak'' is a noble attempt to create a piece for the entire family which seems to be one mission of the ODC troupe.The title says a great deal however about the level of wit in this eveninglong work choreographed by Brenda Way and Kimi Okada to music by Paul Dresher and Bruce Barthol. ''Outawak'' was inspired by the teen-age son of one of the choreographers and by Norton Juster's ''Phantom Tollbooth'' a children's book that shares the dance's tone of cool disengagement. The plot is familiar and ''Outawak'' slips quickly through its points about language and learning. So it's hard to imagine the very young or the more sophisticated young audience finding the piece the solidly entertaining and even provocative theater experience its creators seem to be aiming for.''Outawak'' tells the story of Cosmo a typically tuned-out teen-ager who falls into cyberspace and a series of misadventures in the divided city of Wak. Cosmo is quickly recruited into the B-9 squad a group of resistance fighters seeking to make peace between the forces of Numeragua and Verbia committed respectively to order and logic and to expressive passion. Along the way Cosmo meets Molly XYZ a pretty ferocious member of B-9 and a host of nutty characters with names like Hopping Hindsight Nuances of Narrowness Raging Hormone and Crippling Rigidity several of whom resemble the parents and sisters he left behind. After many chases arrests and melees Cosmo discovers Balance the key to peace and reunites the warring factions.Not all of this is clear. But Daniel Levi-Sanchez who plays Cosmo has a serenity and sweetness that acts as ballast in the storm. The cheerful hard-working cast also included Shannon Mitchell Kevin Ware Patricia Jiron Karina Richter Damon White and Heather Tietsort in lead roles. The sets and lighting were by Alexander V. Nichols with costumes by Barbara Bandy and Estelle Akamine. The film was by Wendy Slick and the slide designs were by Mr. Nichols and Larry Ackerman. Live music including rapping was provided by the Paul Dresher Ensemble Electro-Acoustic Band.

9,Philip W. Bonsal a career diplomat and the last United States Ambassador to Cuba died Wednesday in his home here. He was 92.He had been under treatment for pneumonia.When Mr. Bonzal arrived in Havana in February 1959 as Ambassador relations between the United States and the revolutionary Castro Government had already begun to deteriorate. But stepping off the plane Mr. Bonsal shook hands with a bearded Castro emissary and congratulated him on the bravery of the revolutionaries who had overthrown the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista which had been backed by Washington for many years.The act was widely noted in the Cuban press and Prime Minister Fidel Castro later the Cuban President expressed appreciation for his "friendly cordial" approach.Despite this auspicious beginning Mr. Bonsal was unable to develop a dialogue with the revolutionary and as nationalization of American-owned companies proceeded his counsel of quiet negotiation was largely ignored in Washington.

8,Every morning by the dawn's early light thousands of starlings take off from their perches in the magnolia trees around the White House. They fly to Virginia and Maryland to spend the day on the job which is mostly eating bugs and worms.At the twilight's last gleaming these reverse commuters fly back home to the White House.They are hardly welcome there because of the mess and noise they make especially around the patio of the South Portico facing the Mall.The birds have outlasted all attempts at eviction but Irvin Williams the chief horticulturist of the White House says he has not given up. ''You can watch them any morning or night'' said Mr. Williams. ''They fly over Tyson's Corner by the thousands on the way to and from feeding in the countryside.''Mr. Williams said that about a year ago he heard that snakes would scare the birds away. He put two inflated toy snakes in the branches of two magnolia trees. ''It worked for about two weeks'' he said. ''Then they realized the snakes weren't doing them any harm so they came back and just ignored the snakes.''

0,Dumbfounded I replied "That would be me."A few weeks after that I was in another group of scientific eminences this one at a luncheon at the Waldorf. The spokeswoman for the group that organized the event introduced me to one of the group's most eminent guests a leading figure in American science policy."Oh" he said kindly but abstractedly "you work for The New York Times. How nice." The spokeswoman explained again that I was the newspaper's science editor. "An editor" he said. "How nice." The woman explained again but again he could not take it in. "Oh science" he said "How nice." At this point the spokeswoman lost patience. She grabbed the honored guest by both shoulders put her face a few inches away from his and shouted at him -- "She's it!"Not long after I answered the office telephone and the caller a (male) scientist asked to speak to several of my colleagues all male and all out. "May I help you?" I inquired. "No no no" he replied. "I don't want to talk to you I want to talk to someone important!"Even at the time I could laugh at these experiences. After all I was a grown-up person who could take care of herself. (I informed the caller that all the men he wanted to talk to worked for me and then I hung up. As for Dr. Twerpy he should know that he was not the first man to refer to me professionally as "that little girl." I reported on the doings of the other one until he was indicted.)But the memories of the seventh grader are still not funny. Neither is it amusing to reflect on what happened to a college friend who was the only student in her section to pass linear algebra the course the math department typically used to separate the sheep from the mathematical goats. Talk about stigma! She changed her major to American civilization.Another friend graduating as a math major was advised not to bother applying for a graduate research assistantship because they were not given to women. She eventually earned a doctorate in math but one of her early forays into the job market ended abruptly when she was told she should stay home with her husband rather than seek employment out of town.Experiences like hers -- the outright outloud dashing of a promising mathematician's hopes simply because of her sex -- are no longer the norm. At least I hope not. But they are enough by themselves to tell us why there are relatively few women in the upper ranks of science and mathematics today.
0,I have a lot to say today.The best of the “Unforgivable” videos are truly deeply scarily hilarious. And yeah they’re not safe for work at all. Watch “Unforgivable” No. 1 (search “unforgivable” on YouTube) twice if you dare even to look at it because the sham misogyny will clog your humor gears the first time — you won’t get it and you’ll say you’re stumped or offended.“Unforgivable” is a giganto hit with the children of Facebook the ones who watch “Family Guy” and miss Dave Chappelle every day. The four videos in this particular series have racked up more than a million views each on YouTube. It’s mind-blowing the more you think about it. Comedy in the woods — black comedy in the woods — is snakes/planes perfect sure. One look and you’re just into it. But there are also the lurching threats of this guy and then his retreats into falsetto giggles and his back-and-forth with the cameraman.Steve Bryant who introduced me to “Unforgivable” deserves huge thanks. This is Steve Bryant matinee idol Talmudic master of YouTube Zizek of The Daily Reel. (You are insane if you don’t look at The Daily Reel every day by the way.)Watch this “Unforgivable” guy try to affect his thug thing and the instability of the gangsta pose and the waffle fries and the “You better not have no brothers.”There’s an Eddie Murphy line that gets in my head these days and it’s not even a bit it’s just a phrase like a bridge that followed one of those awesome barks on “Comedian” and “Delirious.” It’s “I kid the homosexuals.”The end of the joke is “… because they homosexuals” which is all right but if I remember the album — damn you conscience for not using Limewire — the audience cracks up at just the first part “I kid the homosexuals.”Eddie is coming down from some gay jokes but he’s also setting up some more gay jokes — of the “gays are cool” kind — and he wants to excuse his lapse into obviousness and tautology (“I joke about X because X is X”) before offering some more nuanced take on his relation to gayness and femininity which — as we all know — would get more “nuanced” with the introduction of a transvestite and his own subsequent career as a cross-dresser.Anyway I kid the … I kid the … Basically like so many of us I kid the networks. That’s all I wanted to say in light of yesterday’s article in the newspaper about FunnyOrDie and SuperDeluxe two Big Comedy efforts to ignore what’s already happening online warm over “S.N.L.”-style outtakes and kitchen scraps from pilot season and try to use them — and household names — to bulldoze the comedy shacks and shanties that have been around for years.Cool OK. Monopoly! Comedopoly. Adam Smith etc. But we can still complain when it’s not funny.And we can still kid the “Saturday Night Live” veterans the big straight-guy bullies of comedy like Will Ferrell and Jimmy Fallon because … they’re straight white guys. Who wouldn’t kid them big guys all crammed into tiny screens? And now with the Sequoia Capital piling up you have your Jimmy-come-lately Web sites with your focus-grouped names. FunnyOrDiiiiiiiiiie.But so far every new network venture into Web land makes me want to live my life exclusively in Ebaumsworld. Where at least the crazy son-and-pop team of Rochester have been just doing their freakshow thing for a long long time. And drawing massive international crowds.So that was all a big wind-up way to say that AOL’s “This Just In” sends me a lot of video. And some of it is mediocre some of it’s fine some of it’s OK some of it’s hard to even press play for.But there’s this. Which I like. It’s among the best things they have. But compared to the omg awesomeness of “Unforgivable”? It’s nowhere.A special report on school violence from This Just In.

1,Whenever I looked at a picture of Kate Moss I thought of Corinne Day who died last Friday at her home in England. The two women model and photographer were linked long past Ms. Day’s first pictures in the early ’90s of the teenage Ms. Moss and I suppose that is inevitable when a truth is revealed.The plain unaffected beauty that Ms. Day and other photographers captured was nowhere to be found in glossy fashion magazines or on the Paris or Milan runways. It was the era of aggressive sexuality whether from Jean Paul Gaultier Thierry Mugler or Gianni Versace and the young photographers and stylists who worked in London usually for very little money could not identify with that view of women. And they knew there was something else going on; they only had to look around them.The style was called grunge but it plainly real and very human. I loved hearing the stories about that time from Melanie Ward and though I didn’t know Ms. Day I always admired her work. Her pictures told us that she knew something about the lives of the models she photographed that she empathized with them. That was one of Ms. Day’s secrets. Fashion itself is boring. But keep looking. And witness her curiosity and grace in some of the pictures she took in 2004 and 2005 in particular Gemma Ward at Glastonbury. They’re gorgeous.

0,The ''Shorts Stop'' segments which begin this Sunday aim to show that music videos are related to the rock documentary at least in spirit. So these programs feature the work of independent filmmakers -- including Mr. Moore despite his antivideo stance -- who have crossed over in both directions.The series host Mark Anthony Thompson talks loftily about ''the cross-pollination of music and cinema'' -- at least as lofty as a man can be slouching on a couch and wearing sunglasses (indoors) and orange flip-flops. But the series proves mainly that interesting imagery distracts from good music and can't elevate lousy music and that annoying pictures can actually prove deafening. You simply tune out.The best work in the series comes not surprisingly from Spike Jonze who sprang exuberantly from the video world into film with the inventive ''Being John Malkovich'' (and more recently into the world of politics with his biographical documentary of Al Gore for the Democratic convention). His ''Oh So Quiet'' music video for the Icelandic pop star Bjork set in a Goodyear tire store is an extravagantly produced homage to Hollywood musicals of the 1930's. Bjork gleefully high-kicks and prances in an orange dress looking happy to be in this bright amusing little spectacle where the music and pictures actually seem to have something to do with one another (even if they don't).Another film director Hal Hartley has created an amusing mock concert for the English folk singer Beth Orton's ''Stolen Car.'' While singing Ms. Orton slyly assumes ''meaningful'' poses in various corners of a room flops on a couch and pretends not to notice the expressionless assistants sticking microphones in front of her mouth. She pricks her finger with the thorn of a rose and a drop of her blood lazily drifts through a glass of water. Mr. Hartley has artfully staged the video in grays and reds but I'd still rather listen to Ms. Orton's lovely voice with my eyes closed.As for the pugnacious Mr. Moore director (of ''Roger and Me'') and television crusader (on ''The Awful Truth'' and ''TV Nation'') he paired up with a band that could have been named just for him Rage Against the Machine. Mr. Moore has styled his video as just another of his impromptu assaults -- this one on the New York Stock Exchange. As Rage wails outside the exchange the police arrive. Mr. Moore confronts. The action is intercut with a parody of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' No daisy fields that's for sure.

0,The preacher a Yale Law School graduate bowed his head before the television cameras and prayed ''We ask for miracles in regard to the Supreme Court.''Well don't we all from time to time. But it's a relief to report that this particular prayer of the Rev. Pat Robertson the TV evangelist and chronic politician is going unheeded. Mr. Robertson has been beseeching heaven to strike the Supreme Court with divinely enforced retirements. But the 21-day ''prayer offensive'' for an almighty purging of court ''liberals'' (sic) is winding down with the court intact and on a well-earned vacation.''They've entered into the arena on the side of evil'' Mr. Robertson told his flock after the court voted to strike down Texas's criminalization of consensual homosexual behavior. He had the garishly bad taste to dwell on the ages and infirmities of some of his least favorite jurists.This sort of pulpit tomfoolery would hardly seem worth any attention if Mr. Robertson were a less politically significant figure. But he is the founder of the Christian Coalition which is still taken seriously and he had a credible following as a presidential candidate. The flirtation with the politics of religious righteousness will undoubtedly turn up in the next election cycle even if it's in less ludicrous garb.

0,In the icy annals of emperor-penguin research Apsley Cherry-Garrard has been one-upped.The British explorer described his research project as “The Worst Journey in the World” a memoir that has become a classic of the explornography genre. In his 1911 quest to retrieve eggs from an emperor penguin rookery Cherry-Garrard trekked through the Antarctic winter with temperatures of -70 degrees Fahrenheit. He lost his tent (and he assumed any prospect of surviving) when it was blown away during a blizzard by hurricane-force winds. The tent was miraculously found afterwards and he survived to bring the eggs back to the Natural History Museum in London.It was a heroic achievement. But for all that Cherry-Garrard endured in that dark frigid winter he never to the best of my knowledge attempted to measure the rectal temperature of an emperor penguin.It remained for future researchers to accomplish that feat — and more. They also performed field surgery on an emperor penguin. By taking both the rectal and the core temperatures of emperor penguins at the rookery they’ve learned the penguins’ secret for surviving the winter without a tent.The American Physiological Society which is publishing the French research team’s results reports that the scientists began their work by “entering into the colony with bulb thermometers” and determining that “huddling penguins maintain a lower rectal temperature than birds which were isolated from the colony.” But that still didn’t quite explain how the penguins conserve enough energy to survive four cold months without eating so the researchers captured five pairs of the birds and surgically implanted devices to measure the temperature deep inside their bodies.The scientists found that the incubating birds lowered their core temperatures by two degrees Fahrenheit and kept it fairly constant affected by neither the cold weather nor the heat generated when the penguins huddled together. The researchers suggest this constant temperature was achieved by a depression in the birds’ metabolic rate which “explains why the birds neither suffer from hyperthermia despite the very high ambient temperatures within the huddle nor become hypothermic due to the harsh cold.”And how did the birds reduce their metabolic rate? “Such depression could be achieved by entering sleep. In fact during tight huddles birds were observed with their eyes closed.”So the emperor penguins were sleeping on the job — not that there’s anything wrong with that. I don’t begrudge them their shuteye nor all the cinematic adulation they’ve been getting for their perseverance. But the more I hear about what’s been going on in these rookeries the more impressed I am with the perseverance of penguin researchers. There’s a book in this for one of the thermometer-toting scientists: “The Worst Job in the World.”
8,''I beg I ask I don't care'' said Sister Thomasina. ''I say: 'Give me clothes. Not for me for my patients.' ''The sisters find their patients all over the big hospital building in lower Manhattan. A nurse will call to tell them that she has someone being discharged who quite simply has nothing to wear. Some had their clothes cut off when they reached the emergency room with a bullet or knife wound; others had their clothes burned because the creases were filled with lice.Some wore garments that were returning to threads and lint shoes that had not had soles for weeks coats without sleeves or linings. Many of the nuns' patients are men eyes rheumy faces years older than their years who have been admitted to the alcohol detoxification program. Some are women who have come to the emergency room feet so swollen and creased that they look like elephant feet.For those women Sister Matilda will go down to the discount stores on 14th Street and buy a pair of slippers in some gargantuan size. For the others she and Sister Thomasina will take measurements with their yellow-gold ribbon tape measures and then return to their storeroom there to put together the right thing: the blue corduroy pants with the blue and red plaid shirt the gray sweater with the gray pants and black shoes.It seems never to have occurred to either nun that it is possible to send people who sleep in doorways and drink all day out into the world with clothes that do not match or do not fit.It seems not to concern them to know that some of those who return to the hospital with tattered garments in need of burning will be wearing the same clothes the sisters mended and fitted on them months before.''The young girls and boys we try to give them something a little fancy'' said Sister Matilda sadly. ''They should look nice. I dress a nice girl the other day she say 'Sister I can't go out I have no clothes these are all dirty and holes.' I got her the blouse the slacks. Beautiful.''
1,A citizen journalist in Syria who has been instrumental in assisting those covering the conflict in Homs helping evacuate wounded journalists from inside the city’s neighborhood of Baba Amr has been seized and perhaps tortured by the Syrian government an activist told CNN on Saturday.The citizen journalist Ali Mahmoud Othman was the head of the media center in Homs according to CNN and was thought to be at a secure military unit in Aleppo added the activist who requested anonymity for security reasons. “We believe Ali is being subjected to severe torture” the activist told CNN. “The lives of our activists and citizen journalists across the whole country are now at risk.”William Hague the British foreign secretary said in a statement that he was “very concerned” about the treatment of Mr. Othman. He has called on Syrian authorities to release Mr. Othman and other political prisoners “immediately.”Activists cited the apparent detention of an essential cog in the “citizen journalist network” as the latest example of President Bashar al-Assad’s crackdown against journalists trying to chronicle the bloody conflict.CNN said that the media team that worked with Mr. Othman in Baba Amr issued a statement placing “full responsibility on the Syrian Assad regime for any harm caused to the journalist Ali Othman.”On Sunday Sen. John McCain of Arizona released his own statement on the reports of Mr. Othman’s detention:There are credible and troubling reports that the Syrian journalist Ali Mahmoud Othman has been detained and is being tortured by Assad’s forces. This courageous man has risked his life repeatedly to tell the story of the Syrian people and he put himself in harm’s way to help get wounded Western journalists out of Syria. The world must unite in calling for the immediate release of Ali Mahmoud Othman as well as every other Syrian prisoner of conscience being held by Assad.He also posted a message on Twitter.Got reports that Syrian journalist Ali Mahmoud Othman is held & tortured by Assad forces- world must call 4 his release mccain.senate.gov/public/index.c… — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) April 1 2012Heather Blake the United Kingdom’s representative for the journalist watchdog group Reporters Without Borders told CNN on Saturday that the Syrian authorities were “systematically targeting journalists working inside Syria and particularly local journalists and the media centers that have been set up.”At least eight journalists have been killed while covering the conflict since November according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Five were killed in February including Marie Colvin a correspondent for The Sunday Times of London.
9,Ms. Goldstein said she expects to serve more vegetable main courses. Mr. Kunz also hopes to sell more tasting menus not in response to any pleas for lightness from his customers but as a showcase for his style.A close relationship with regional growers is integral to the insistence on flavor; great flavor is impossible without superb fresh ingredients. Alain Ducasse the renowned French chef from Monte Carlo has told students at the Culinary Institute of America that 60 percent of the quality of the dish depends on the ingredients. To that end chefs around the United States have resolved to work more closely with farmers.Starr Boggs the owner of Starr Boggs in Westhampton Beach L.I. is lucky enough to have a restaurant surrounded by farmers and fishermen. Other chefs have to reach farther afield. "I'm tired of having everything flown in and there's no reason why some of the items can't be grown here" said Mr. Gross who is searching for farmers around Phoenix.Mr. Bouley who has cultivated a long list of farmers in the New York region said "I want to spend as much time as possible with farmers and I intend to look for growers in Virginia and the Carolinas who can enrich the winter season with quality produce."Such alliances Mr. Kunz suggested will trickle down into the consumer produce markets. "There are a number of wonderful products that we use that consumers can't find like fresh pea shoots in the spring that you can cook like spinach but have the flavor of sweet young peas" he said.Tight money notwithstanding a number of new restaurants are in the works. In a few months David Burke late of the River Cafe in Brooklyn will be at the stove at a new restaurant on Park Avenue and 63d Street. Red Sage the lavish new Southwestern restaurant that Mark Miller of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe N.M. is opening in Washington will be ready in February. Eberhard Mueller the former executive chef of Le Bernardin expects to open Opus a fish restaurant in Santa Monica Calif. in March. Alberta Wright who owns Jezebel which serves Southern food in Manhattan's theater district will be heading west. She's working on a new restaurant on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood Calif."I think business will be good" she said. "I think there's a need for a restaurant like Jezebel in Los Angeles." She predicted that it would do better than the Paris version of Jezebel which closed several months ago.
0,Paris’s labyrinthine underground Les Halles marketplace is about to get a new destination that even American visitors will be able to ask for by name. Cinema Street (known locally as “Rue de Cinema”) will be dedicated on Friday by Mayor Bertrand Delanoë Agence France-Presse reported to celebrate the completion of renovations on the marketplace’s historic Forum des Images movie theater. The street offers visitors a modern 16-screen multiplex cinema and a library named for the director François Truffaut with a collection of 17000 books and 10000 DVDs; the renovated Forum will also have a vault of 5500 films all newly transferred to digital format. “This is the first time that a city has said to itself that its memory does not only exist in books but also in images” Laurence Herszberg the director of the Forum told Agence France-Presse.

0,MALIPO China - After a walk up a steep stone staircase first-time visitors are astonished when the veterans' cemetery just outside this town finally pops into view: as far as the eye can see the curving arcade of hillside is lined with row after row of crypts each with its concrete headstone emblazoned with a large red star a name and an inscription.Long Chaogang and Bai Tianrong though had both been here before. The two men veterans of China's war with Vietnam which began with intense combat in mid-February of 1979 return from time to time looking for lost friends. And for more than an hour this day they climbed up and down the deserted mountainside near the Vietnam border searching in vain through the names of the 957 soldiers buried here stopping now and then to light a cigarette and place it on a tomb in offering to a comrade.The silence that prevails here disturbed only by a gentle breeze rustling through the cemetery's bamboo groves is fitting for a war that is being deliberately forgotten in China. By official reckoning 20000 Chinese died during the first month of fighting when this country's forces invaded Vietnam in the face of spirited resistance and untold others died as the war sputtered on through the 1980's. There are no official estimates of Vietnamese casualties but they are thought to have been lower.Sixteen years on China has produced no "Rambo" much less a "Deer Hunter" or "Platoon." There have been a few movies novels and memoirs about the suffering of the soldiers and their families. But no searing explorations of the horror or moral ambiguity of war. There are no grander monuments than cemeteries like these found mostly in this remote border region. China in short has experienced no national hand-wringing and has no Vietnam syndrome to overcome.

9,''I made a complete model of the Palais Royal before deciding what would work'' said Ms. Pepper 77 an American who lives between New York and Todi Italy. ''This is an extraordinary challenge because my work is vertical and high and the trees are vertical. Putting something vertical next to the vertical is very complicated. Because the space is long and narrow I opted to turn it into an installation with a series of portals to create an experience as you go along.''Ms. Pepper's large abstract sculptures in iron and steel some of which evoke Brancusi others Giacometti were most recently exhibited in the spacious gardens of Fort Belvedere in Florence. Perhaps surprisingly they look equally at home here. The space imposes symmetry and Ms. Pepper has not tried to fight it. Her first piece ''Cleopatra's Wedge'' 18 feet high and weighing 4000 pounds sets the tone its broad face presiding atop a wooden plinth like a sentinel -- one of her favorite words for her work -- over the entire installation.It leads to an assortment of columns at times reminscent of ornate medieval lances as well as to what she calls ''urban altars'' through which people can walk. In the middle a circle of five smaller sculptures called ''Moline Markers'' which she describes as ''metamorphosized tools'' provide a moment of relief from the monumentalism. ''I don't try to get into meaning'' she said. ''I'm interested in memory continuity a sense of the past. I believe in the permanence of beings and things.''Ms. Abakanowicz 69 who currently has an installation of five large sculptures on the Roof Garden at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York presents her works on a more human scale with the exception of ''Cor-ten Armor'' two geometrical forms that resemble stylized dinosaur heads. Versions of some of the sculptures here are also present in New York among them ''Figure on Beam'' ''Birds'' and ''Bambini'' which shows 100 (in New York there are 40) small headless figures. All but ''Bronze Crowds'' (1991) comprising 35 larger headless figures have been done in the last year.''When I was invited to show here a year ago I was empty I had nothing'' she said. ''So this was a stimulus for me to make things. I had always wanted to do 'Birds.' I had a real need to do 'Birds.' I think they fit into the rhythms of this garden with the lace of the trees.''

1,Administrivial New Puzzle Blog Alert! If you love doing cryptic crosswords hopefully you’ve discovered the ones that Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto construct over at The Nation. Now they’ve started a new blog called Word Salad which will discuss the cryptic puzzles and more! Check it out here.FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — Have you ever filled in an entry with little or no idea what it meant?I enjoyed Scott Atkinson’s Friday offering very much but set a further challenge for myself today by doing the puzzle mostly from the Across clues. It’s a good thing too because it got me 1 Down. Even so I had no idea what it meant. Never having heard the phrase “KATIE BAR THE DOOR” I parsed the phrase incorrectly in every possible way except the correct one. Finally just as I was about to bow down to the Google gods it hit me (the phrase not the door). That’s one I will not forget.Evan Sung for The New York TimesCrossing Katie is ETERNAL OPTIMIST which I thought looked beautiful in the grid didn’t you? I also liked MOONLIGHT SONATA amongst the long entries.In the Wordplay Department “Chihuahua scratch?” is a brilliant clue for PESO and the same goes for “It has a sticking point” for HYPO.I usually get a lot of questions when a clue like this comes up so I will give 60 Down away right here: MNO are the three letters on the number 6 button on your phone. No I don’t mind if you check. I’ll wait right here. See? You’re welcome.Also from the “Are You Sure?” Department: The “Center of cat-tails” is O’NINE because … well I’ll just let you look that one up yourself. And finally yes NONCONTIGUOUSLY (in this puzzle at least) means that none of the black squares are touching each other.Happy 100th birthday to the crossword cookie the OREO. I bought a package of the special edition Birthday Cake Oreos and even though I am not a huge fan of the regular ones these are awesome. The creme is much sweeter and is probably flavored to taste like frosting. They are a big hit in my house let me tell you and there will be a showdown over the last cookie. Katie bar the door!And now your Beethoven moment:Your thoughts?

The announcement did not say where along the 800‐mile border the fighting took place.The Rhodesian Government said its army had intercepted a guerrilla force crossing into Rhodesia from Zambia and killed 26. of the black insurgents. It did not say. when or where along the border the battle took place.
9,Hilly Kristal founder and owner of the seminal East Village punk club CBGB called the policy unfortunate. "I would take each request separately" he said. "The music itself does not stir up anything terrible and a lot of these kids who come to see it and listen to it are fine. There can be 500 people and maybe 10 or 15 who cause the trouble." Verifying NamesAlthough the city has many restrictions on large events held in public spaces especially Central Park until yesterday the Parks Department had dealt loosely with smaller events.It has not required photo identification cards so that the city could verify the name and address of a permit seeker.The city has always made concert promoters post bonds on average of $250 for cleanup. If the organizers failed to restore parks to their original state they forfeited the money. But the $250 was low compared to the real cost Mr. Stern said.Under the changes he said the city will have greater flexibility in imposing higher cleanup bonds -- as high as $5000 -- on high-risk concerts and locations. "If there's a history of violence or failure to clean up the bond will go up" he said.John Miller deputy commissioner of public information for the police said the department does not keep statistics on the violence rates of one group of music fan versus another. "We can't characterize one form of art as causing more aggression than another -- albeit we haven't seen Mozart fans looting on the streets."Parks officials said Summerfest had a permit to showcase local heavy metal rap and punk rock bands from 2 to 6 P.M. Because of technical difficulties said Susan Alexander an organizer the concert began late and with the agreement of the police ended at 6:17 P.M. The authorities do not dispute this point but disagree on what ensued.

0,American and Australian troops killed four suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters along the Afghan frontier in the past two days military officials said today as hundreds of allied troops under United States command swept the border area near Pakistan.Military officials said that a force of fewer than 1000 allied fighters had been working in and out of the border area for more than a week and that they had found large caches of weapons but few adversaries despite the recent firefights.The allied fighters include Afghans American Special Forces troops from the 101st Airborne Division and Australian and British special operations forces and Royal Marines.A Pakistani intelligence official said a major American-led military operation would probably begin in the area around Khost in the next 24 hours. Pakistan the official said had already been alerted to seal its border along Afghanistan's Paktia Province. An American communications and intelligence center had been set up in the tribal area on the Pakistani side to help coordinate the operation the official said.

8,The Consolidated Foods Corporation said today that shareholders of Nicholas Kiwi Ltd. had approved a Consolidated Foods offer to buy a major share of Kiwi for $330 million.Since its first offer of $250 million for 75 percent of Kiwi on Oct. 2 Consolidated Foods had been locked in a bidding war for Kiwi with Reckitt & Colman P.L.C. a major British household products company.Kiwi is an Australian maker of household shoe and personal-care products.John H. Bryan Jr. chairman and chief executive of Consolidated Foods which is based in Chicago said in a telephone interview from Melbourne Australia that shareholders apparently were swayed by the offer of cash plus stock in ''the new Nicholas Kiwi Australia.''Under the agreement Consolidated would acquire all of Kiwi's non-Australian operations which account for about 80 percent of the company's sales. It would also own 15 percent of Kiwi's Australian operations. Mr. Bryan said that Kiwi's current management would continue to supervise its worldwide operations.
9,''The only people who did not lose money were those who couldn't put their hands on any'' said Mr. Prushi. ''There were people who sold their houses others sold their cows and now their children don't even have milk.''Mrs. Rinxhi reached for the cigarettes she started smoking again when the crisis began her eyes filling with tears. ''We are in a terrible situation'' she said. ''It can't be worse.''Today Mr. Xhaferri is in jail his fund seized by the Government; Marta the woman who ran the local Xhaferri office collecting wads of leks -- the Albanian currency -- from people who spent hours waiting in line has disappeared. And the people of Fushe-Kruja a shabby dusty town of 25000 responded last weekend by joining the rest of the country in street demonstrations which in some places have turned into near-riots.Thrown on the defensive the center-right Government of President Sali Berisha has promised to restore at least some of the missing money to the people on Nov. 5 to be distributed through savings account passbooks and options to bid on state property. The Government has also lashed out at its already feeble opposition and has blamed opponents for fomenting the violence last weekend.But here where the demonstrations were peaceful residents insist that the Government is to blame for the catastrophe that has befallen them. Like many others they are waiting to see if President Berisha fulfills his promise. ''We want our money'' said Mr. Prushi. ''We don't want pieces of paper.''Fushe-Kruja like many small towns in this nation of 3.5 million was a relative late-comer to the national craze which by October of last year had reached frenzied levels. By then funds like Xhaferri were stepping up efforts to collect more money opening new offices promising ever higher rates of return over ever shorter periods of time -- all signs that the bubble was about to burst.But when Mr. Xhaferri came here nobody really wanted to ask him hard questions like how he could promise to triple their money in three months in a country with meager investments and 20 percent unemployment.

0,I’m uncomfortable with the tone of some of the coverage of Bob Woodruff and ABC. Part of it is that the coverage is so largely focused on this being a blow to ABC News — which is true but seems a bit secondary to the blow to Woodruff himself and his family.But more important the backdrop of the reporting sometimes contains the implication that Woodruff’s reporting from Iraq or elsewhere was a business strategy to woo viewers. Look I don’t doubt that the business side felt that it was good for ratings to have an anchor out in the field — but above all it was good journalism.In my New York Review of Books essay on Darfur I complained about the trend in TV news of having “breathless blondes reporting on missing blondes.” Woodruff reporting in Iraq was the opposite of that — he may have been a pretty face but he was reporting on a substantive story that doesn’t titillate but is enormously important for our country. And anchors traditionally haven’t just been airheads who stand on the masking tape as instructed by their executive producers — they’ve also been managing editors of their news shows and involved in news decisions. That’s proper but it also means that they need to get out in the field and see for themselves. Woodruff wasn’t simply executing some business side policy when he was injured; he was practicing journalism.Moreover there’s a danger of treating Woodruff too lightly simply because he’s so telegenic. Look this is a guy who speaks fluent Chinese who lived in China (overlapping in Beijing with me in the late 1980’s) who left a job at a major law firm to become a TV correspondent. I think it’s great that he wanted to do real reporting and it’s tragic that he was hurt at the beginning (and now perhaps end) of his anchor career.I’m afraid all this carping about the damage to ABC will make it less likely that other TV anchors will actually get out in the field as well. (My challenge to Bill O’Reilly to join me in Darfur is still open). Instead of portraying Woodruff as some pawn of business executives we should be celebrating him for trying bravely to go against the grain of today’s TV news shows and commit serious international journalism.

1,TOUHEY--Carl E. A lifelong Albany businessman passed away on August 25th 2013 at the remarkable age of 95. Born in 1917 to Winifred and Charles Touhey he was a graduate of the Albany Academy and Princeton University (1939). He ran a stunning race for Mayor of Albany in 1973 almost defeating the notorious Albany democratic machine. He was the President of Orange Motor Company which was founded by his father Charles on Friday the 13th 1916. Carl always chuckled at that date adding "And we're still standing still strong!" For over 75 years his various businesses provided employment for hundreds of Albany area families. A passionate philanthropist he felt the responsibility to give back to his community. When asking others to do the same he had an interesting strategy. He would say "How can I get big bucks from this guy? First I need to set the tone by stepping up myself." And he did. Some of his favorite organizations were more traditional ones such as Albany Medical Center The College of Saint Rose and Saratoga Performing Arts Center. But he also cared about smaller organizations like Capital Region Sponsor a Scholar and the 15 Love Youth Program both of which directly serve families in the community. He will be greatly missed by his wife Nancy and his children Charles John Lila Marie Virginia their spouses as well as the mother of his children Lila L. Touhey and seven grandchildren and great grandchildren. Predeceased by his sister Alice and his brother Frank Carl was a surrogate father to their children as well as Nancy's many children and grandchildren. Contributions may be made to Capital Region Sponsor a Scholar Albany NY or The Achievement Center for Children and Families Delray Beach FL.

9,As an adult Ms. Lord has kept Golf Cottage a small 19th-century house across a road from the nine-hole golf course on the Winterthur property. She asked her father to leave it to her instead of the large house he built to move into when the mansion became a nonprofit museum in 1951.On a low butler's table in the tiny living room was a florist's arrangement of flowers that Winterthur's publicity agent had had sent for the interview. ''I didn't get around to tearing that up'' she said.''I like everything plain'' she said asked about a handful of fresh daffodils in a teacup on the windowsill. ''The furniture? It's nothing. Most of it came from Lord & Taylor.''If objects tell stories for all of the magnificence of Winterthur Mr. du Pont's relationship with his daughter was thinly furnished -- a man with 58 sets of china who recorded in detail his table settings for lunch and dinner for 50 years but found it hard to choose words for his children.''He almost never spoke'' said Ms. Lord who worked with archives at Winterthur and cases of correspondence to construct her parents' half of her childhood. ''He was a very sort of kindly person but he was not intimate.''As is clear to a visitor Mr. du Pont saved much of his affection for things.''After my father died there was an Oriental rug that wound up in Connecticut in my house which I thought was very pretty'' Ms. Lord said. ''One day I noticed that sewn into one of the corners which said 'Albany' -- that was my room -- was 'When Miss R. E. is in residence.' That was me. Ruth Ellen.'' Her father had what he considered ''an inferior rug'' Ms. Lord said put down when she was expected home. ''Obviously my father had a terrific distrust of children and he thought I was going to ruin everything so the good stuff was apparently moved out when I was there.''Golf Cottage was empty when Ms. Lord was a child at Winterthur. She went there with her nurse to row on the pond and catch tadpoles. As a girl she sat inside to smoke cigarettes ''with pals'' as she put it.

1,“Festival of Lights” seeks to illuminate an immigrant world we don’t hear much about: people who have fled the South American country of Guyana seeking a better life in New York. But the film by Shundell Prasad seems reluctant to spend much time in or on Guyana and so it ends up being largely just another story about a rebellious American teenager.Reshma (Melinda Shankar) leaves Guyana when still a child after the country’s violence (which is not explained) hits too close to home. Her mother (Ritu Singh Pande) brings her to New York but her father (Jimi Mistry) is forced to stay behind promising to join them later. He never does and when Reshma grows up she returns to Guyana to look for him. She finds him in jail where he has been for years for reasons explained only vaguely.Her trip doesn’t provide much detail about the country or its problems just assorted hints that corruption and injustice are endemic. The core of the movie ends up being Reshma’s growing-up years in New York which as teenage years go are fairly generic melodrama.“Festival of Lights” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence including a sexual assault.
8,Israeli troops and their Lebanese Christian allies were reported today to have stormed a Shiite Moslem village in southern Lebanon and forced its entire population of about 2000 to leave.The police here said Israeli soldiers and militiamen of the Israel-allied South Lebanon Army ringed the village Kunin in the Israeli-designated ''security zone'' and ordered all the inhabitants to gather in the village square.There according to witnesses quoted by the police 32 young men were rounded up and the rest of the villagers were ordered to move out.A number of houses were blown up and set on fire according to an account today in An Nahar the Beirut daily.
1,Conservative commentators and die-hard Republicans often brush off denunciations of Donald Trump as an unprincipled hatemonger by saying: Yeah yeah that’s what Democrats wail about every Republican they’re trying to take down. Sing me a song I haven’t heard so many times before.Howard Wolfson would be outraged by that response if he didn’t recognize its aptness.“There’s enough truth to it to compel some self-reflection” Wolfson who was the communications director for Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid in 2008 told me this week.In fact he finds himself thinking about it a whole lot: how extreme the put-downs of political adversaries have become; how automatically combatants adopt postures of unalloyed outrage; what this means when they come upon a crossroads — and a candidate — of much greater graver danger.“I worked on the presidential campaign in 2004” he said referring to John Kerry’s contest against George W. Bush. He added that he was also “active in discussing” John McCain when he ran for the presidency in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.
0,Flaws in the F.B.I.'s handling of the Zacarias Moussaoui case before Sept. 11 are prompting Congressional leaders and the Bush administration to try to make it easier for the government to obtain secret wiretaps and search warrants to investigate foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist plots.At a Congressional hearing today lawyers for the Justice Department Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency all expressed support for legislation in the Senate that would lower the standards of evidence required to obtain court approval for secret wiretaps in investigations of foreign terrorists and spies.Under the rules in use last summer F.B.I. officials did not believe they had enough evidence against Mr. Moussaoui before Sept. 11 to prove that he was an agent of a foreign power or had connections to an international terrorist group. He now faces trial in federal court accused of being the 20th hijacker.Under the legislation sponsored by Senator Charles E. Schumer Democrat of New York and Senator Jon Kyl Republican of Arizona the Justice Department would no longer have to convince a special court that a suspect was an agent of a foreign power or a member of an international terrorist organization to obtain a wiretap under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

1,Players from other countries followed the U.S.A. Hockey negotiations closely. Janine Weber a member of the Austrian national team said many European women’s players shared news of the boycott on Facebook.“I think it’s something we can all relate to and something we hope to accomplish one day in terms of equal support from our federations” Weber wrote in an email adding that more investment would help close the performance gap between the United States and Canada and the rest of the world in women’s hockey.Jongah Park a forward on South Korea’s national team said that even though women’s hockey was a relatively new sport in her country her team had begun to think about the importance of expanding the game to the point where resources for both genders were equal.“Even we have desire to fight for equal wages and gender equality” Park wrote in an email during the United States team’s boycott. “I don’t know how to do that. But always think of equalities.”American players hope their stance will ultimately assist women’s hockey programs across the world but they first are focused on increasing diversity in U.S.A. Hockey’s leadership.Currently only 15 of 91 voting members of its board of directors are women. It is the only national governing body among American Winter Olympic sports with a board that has less than 20 percent women. According to U.S.A. Hockey’s annual guide the terms of 29 board members end this year.The importance of having strong voices on the board was clear in the contract negotiations.Meghan Duggan the national team captain is a player representative on the board. To avoid a conflict of interest she did not vote but she remained involved in negotiations throughout acting as a channel for the concerns of her 22 teammates.

9,Among some lawmakers especially those who advocate a hard line against immigrants there is a sense that the laws of 1996 were so sweeping that very little more can be done or added to the debate. The budget for the Immigration and Naturalization Service much of it dedicated to enforcement now surpasses that of the F.B.I. and the agency has more employees than either the Department of State or Labor.''The Clinton Administration took some major steps showing that it was serious in trying to control illegal immigration'' said T. Alexander Aleinikoff a law professor at Georgetown University and former general counsel and associate commissioner of the immigration service. ''Some people are saying 'We've dealt with the problem. We've done what we can. Let's move on.' ''But the issue of illegal immigration is far from resolved Mr. Aleinikoff said. There are about five million such immigrants in the United States and no law that specifically addresses what to do with them.Instead lawmakers are sidestepping immigration in their campaigns and have been passing legislation that benefits immigrants and in some cases reverses aspects of previous laws.Congress has restored most of the welfare benefits it took away from legal immigrants in 1996. Lawmakers also restored some of the protections that Central American immigrants had lost therefore sparing them from deportation. Congress granted amnesty to 150000 Nicaraguans 5000 Cubans and 49700 Haitians and allowed hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who hope to gain permanent visas to stay in the United States instead of having to go home to file their applications as the 1996 law dictated.Congress granted $171 million to the immigration agency to speed the naturalization process and for the first time in years it increased by 5000 the number of refugees allowed into the country every year.''The pendulum is definitely swinging our way'' said Judith E. Golub director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington.

8,As if in ascent from his river lounge Raja jutted one of his tusks wet and grand from the water and he huffed the blowzy wet sigh of a defiant champion between rounds. But he stayed resting in the mud idle as the state pensioner he has been for the last 20 years. This nine-foot-high creature is the official national treasure of Sri Lanka and he obviously knows it. As the time for the annual procession approaches concern has grown that he might finally have to be replaced by one of two younger understudies who have been swaggering ambitiously for some time.There is the 45-year-old upstart Raja the Younger who always has a near-lead position in the glittering Tooth Relic procession. He is a local favorite because his tusks seem slightly longer if not more exquisite than the Elder's a considerable factor since only one in 20 Sri Lankan elephants have tusks. And there is the gifted alien Vijayaraja rock-star young at 11 years and imported from Thailand as the official understudy. But he is rushing now to learn the Sinhalese words for the 24 basic elephant commands. These go far beyond simple forward and reverse to graceful sidesteps ear flappings and trunk manipulations that bear out the islanders' conviction that their elephants are paragons of intelligence and grace. Relic Doubted by SomeSome doubt after centuries of plunder and desecration that the casket really contains the sacred tooth said to have been retrieved from the cremation of Buddha in India. Leonard Woolf the colonial official and husband of Virginia claimed to have seen the relic 75 years ago concluding it was not human but ''a canine tooth about three inches and curved.''This is denied as the relic has long been venerated here at the Dalada Maligawa the Temple of the Tooth a rallying point for Sri Lanka across centuries of subjugation.The casket is kept closed and the parade is an annual reaffirmation of national spirit. In this Raja who has received elephantine doses of rheumatism medicines cannot be seen to be flagging in his regal bearing.

1,Forty years ago Sunday on Sept. 2 1972 in Montreal one of the most stunning upsets in the history of sports took place. Team Canada — an N.H.L. all-star team led by Phil Esposito Brad Park Yvan Cournoyer Frank and Peter Mahovlich Bobby ClarkeKen Dryden and the Rangers’ GAG Line of Jean Ratelle Rod Gilbert and Vic Hadfield — met the Soviet national team the world and Olympic champion but a group that had never played a game against professional opponents.It was supposed to be a cakewalk for the Canadians what many in North America believed would be the first of eight straight victories against the supposedly outclassed visitors from behind the Iron Curtain.And indeed that’s how it started with quick goals from Esposito and Paul Henderson. The organist at the Montreal Forum played a funeral march. Esposito laughed and wondered on the bench whether they should take it easy so as not to embarrass the Soviets.But then Yevgeny Zimin scored then Vladimir Petrov then Valeri Kharlamov – twice – and Boris Mikhailov Zimin again and Aleksander Yakushev.When it was all over the Soviets — swirling passing creating beautiful play after beautiful play on clockwork rushes — had shocked the Canadians 7-3. Canada’s image as an unassailable hockey superpower was shattered forever.Vladimir Petrov centered the great Soviet first line in the 1972 Summit Series flanked by his wings Boris Mikhailov and Valery Kharlamov; he scored three goals and four assists in the series’ eight games. Last week Petrov answered our questions via e-mail from Russia on what it was like to play that first game in Montreal in what was then the terra incognita of head-to-head hockey against the great Canadian professionals. (Translation by Vsevolod Kukushkin.)Q.Were you as astonished by your victory as everyone else in the hockey world?A.Naturally we were very surprised with the result of the first game. None of us could even think about such an outcome.Before the game some officials from the sports committee told us “Just don’t lose by a big margin.”Q.Do you think you caught the Canadians off guard?A.It was easier for us to play against them than it was for the Canadians to play against us. We were quite experienced players — we had behind us the Olympics and world championship tournaments. We tried to study them but they did not bother to collect information about us.So for them it was a surprise when they saw us continuing to play our game even after we went down 0-2 in the first seven minutes.After the first victory our bosses who asked us to lose only by the minimum started to tell us that we now must win all the games and we have no right to lose.Q.What was it like to go to Canada?A.We were surprised with many things starting with the royal treatment we received in hotels and so on. After Game 1 we were recognized at every Canadian airport and people were stepping aside to make corridors for us to walk down. As we were going through them some fans gave us friendly slaps on our shoulders. We even joked that Kharlamov had more slaps from fans than body checks in that first game.Q.The Canadians were already playing rough in Game 1 of the series. What was your reaction?A.Speaking frankly we had no experience of playing in a game of such intensity.We were not followers of the Leo Tolstoy philosophy — if you get a slap on the cheek give him one back. We had some fights but we were instructed from the very beginning that it is better to score more goals than to have some fights.But naturally we paid back and as you know some players still remember my friend Boris. [Mikhailov kicked Gary Bergman in the leg with his skate blade in Game 7 bloodying Bergman’s leg.] But that’s history. At that time nobody could foresee that we were forging the history of modern hockey.

1,Melinda Gates will be traveling shortly to Bangladesh to look at maternal health child health and women’s issues (including family planning and reproductive health) — and she has agreed to answer your questions about these topics while she’s there. So please post your questions for Melinda and me about these issues in the comments below and we’ll choose some and give you our best answers.Why these topics? They’re among the most important challenges we face. Women continue to die needlessly in childbirth especially in Africa and South Asia when we know exactly how to save their lives. And infant mortality — especially neo-natal deaths — remain a huge problem in many countries. As for empowering women this isn’t just about justice; it’s also often the most cost-effective way to save lives and benefit entire societies. These are issues that Melinda and the Gates Foundation have thought long and hard about and that I’ve tried to popularize in my column and on Twitter and my Facebook page (and of course in “Half the Sky”).I also have lots of admiration for Bill and Melinda Gates. Until relatively recently philanthropy tended to be about supporting art museums universities and the symphony — all worthy causes but also ones that disproportionately benefit those who are already better off. And much of that giving seems to me to be about networking raising one’s own status or getting one’s grandchildren into the right university. Bill and Melinda helped refocus attention on the world’s neediest citizens and they also brought a tough-minded business-like focus on measurement metrics and getting the most bang for the buck while saving lives. That’s as important as the amount of money they’ve thrown at development problems.So post questions below for Melinda and me. Tough skeptical questions welcome.

9,A Government task force recommended yesterday that the Justice Department assess whether the Upjohn Company committed crimes by failing to report serious side effects caused by the sleeping pill Halcion.Despite the recommendation the task force advised in its report that Halcion could stay on the market because the drug appeared to be safe as long as its users follow label instructions and are aware of possible side-effects. It added that because of unresolved questions about the drug further assessment of Halcion's safety and efficacy might be needed.The task force a committee of outside experts was set up by the Food and Drug Administration in 1994 to investigate possible misconduct by Upjohn in its dealings with the Government over the the sleeping pill.F.D.A. officials were quick to point out that the task force had not made a criminal referral in which a Federal agency turns over information indicating crimes had been committed and requests an investigation. Rather the task force was simply suggesting that Federal prosecutors determine for themselves if such an investigation was needed.

0,As Formula One probably says goodbye to Magny-Cours many people are leaving the track with a sense of relief that it is over. It has been a weekend of truly mixed emotions. The highs of great results from Robert Kubica a return for Ferrari to top form a Kimi Raikkonen lifting himself out of the doldrums to victory again. But on the other side another horrendous reminder of how close the circuit is to racing calamity with the terrible GP2 accident yesterday from which fortunately the driver escaped with only bruising and like Kubica before him a small concussion. But the Formula One paddock learned this morning of tragic news. Three people were killed and two were seriously injured in a helicopter accident last night as they flew from the circuit to a hotel in a nearby town. The injured people were connected to the Bridgestone tire manufacturer but the identity of the victims has not yet been made public although it involves at least two Formula One paddock people.Within days we will all be at Silverstone and Lewis Hamilton will return home with a 14-point lead on Fernando Alonso in the drivers’ series. In its post-race issue today The Red Bulletin reminded readers of the hysteria that surrounded Nigel Mansell’s visits to Silverstone and “a burst of Damon Hill-inspired fanaticism in the mid-90s.” After that period the Bulletin says “Silverstone has been quiet…but that’s about to change.” According to track officials the Bulletin says interest for the race has “gone off the chart.”I’ll provide updates. For now off I go back to my hotel in the countryside near the Magny-Cours circuit for possibly the last time at a French Grand Prix. There have been many fine memories here and unfortunately other kinds as well.

0,Brothers in Tragedy Look for Answers'Two BrothersWho Are Not Brothers'Players TheaterIt is evident almost immediately that "Two Brothers Who Are Not Brothers" a new two-hander by Paul Rawlings that is running at the Players Theater on Macdougal Street is going to offer only limited insights into the cosmic questions it seeks to explore. When the lights come up on Dix the disillusioned half of the pair he is sporting facial hair and a wiseacre delivery. And when Jack the man of faith appears he has unshakable convictions and a Southern accent. Ah the blissful lazy world of theatrical shorthand where all cynics are bearded and all conservative Christians are doctrinaire and from below the Mason-Dixon line.The two men brothers-in-law have been visited by extreme tragedy though to say more would be to severely undercut the first act a collection of fragmentary dialogue that seeks to get you guessing about who's who and what has happened but mostly is just annoying. Jack (John Jimerson) and Dix (Joe Thompson) polar opposites in good Theater 101 fashion are coping with loss each in his own way Jack proclaiming his faith in Jesus Dix getting rid of clothing and furniture and house and anything else that might remind him of happier days.Mr. Rawlings tries to work this into a pithy discussion of faith and fate and why God if there is a God lets bad things happen. But he doesn't have much new to offer on these ageless questions especially not in a city that has been pondering them with far more nuance since Sept. 11 2001.That's not to say that it is without compelling notions. A few stretches where Jack confronts the realization that you can't force faith or friendship onto someone who doesn't want it are nicely rendered and acted. So is a moment when Jack briefly comes face-to-face with the possibility that faith can only take you so far an idea from which he quickly retreats. "We have got to endure this without trying to understand" he says a starkly eloquent admission that may have been the bottom line for many New Yorkers. NEIL GENZLINGER

9,Since the 1970's the Queens Museum of Art has held biennial or triennial exhibitions of work by artists based in Queens. The most recent entry in this series "Live/Work in Queens" reflects the borough's transformation into what the show's curator Christina Yang calls "the nation's most diverse county" one that includes more than 70 ethnic groups speaking almost 200 different languages. Four of the eight artists in the show were born in the United States but the others come from Colombia China Korea and Afghanistan. Not surprisingly the exhibition seems to revolve around the theme of ethnic identity.The problem is that the artistic representation of ethnicity too often turns into self-caricature. The relief paintings of Esperanza Cortes for instance evoke the image of the Hispanic woman as wife mother and martyr by means of an all-too-familiar vocabulary of fractured body parts rendered with sugary realism. Artists should either come to grips with the sado-masochistic subtext of this imagery or -- better yet -- give it a rest.Katherine O'Connor's black-and-white photographs of the Irish village from which her father emigrated are full of soulful melancholy faces whose lines and creases reveal their long struggle with mortality and the elements. This nostalgic view of life in the Old Country is rendered in a pseudo-clinical style that recalls photographers like Nicholas Nixon and Larry Fink but that lacks their formal wit and daring.Other artists here take a more indirect approach to identity. Amanullah Haiderzad who left Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of 1980 makes iron sculptures that echo the characters of Arabic calligraphy without literally reproducing them. Their planar strongly textured forms are curiously reminiscent of work by such American sculptors of the 1940's and 50's as David Smith Herbert Ferber and Seymour Lipton.
8,United States officials decided not to wait for the final report on what caused an engine of a Boeing 737 to explode during take-off in Manchester England two and a half weeks ago. The Federal Aviation Administration last week ordered the inspection of Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15 engines the type involved.They are on a fourth of the jetliners operating in the United States.In Britain about 60 airliners 10 percent of the country's fleet were ordered checked after the disaster which killed 54 people on board. Investigators found cracks in the combustion chambers of some of the engines and British Airways is repairing four of its Boeing 737's.Experts said it takes eight hours and three mechanics to check one engine but the F.A.A. said it did not expect flights to be disrupted ''to any significant degree.''For one thing a substantial number of the 2000 planes involved could be exempt from inspection if they are part of an F.A.A. engine monitoring program. Although about 80 percent of the jetliners in the United States are powered by Pratt & Whitney engines the order covers only the series 15 model of the JT8D in Boeing 737's and 727's and McDonnell Douglas DC-9's.

1,Luis Lora 49 is a master tissue technician at MTF Biologics in Edison N.J. where he processes human tissue that can be used to treat sick or injured patients.What does it mean to work with tissue?Tissue includes cartilage bone ligaments and skin and is used in reconstructive surgery and wound healing as examples. I work for the nonprofit tissue bank formerly known as the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation. We’re a consortium whose members are organ procurement and tissue recovery organizations and academic medical institutions such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I process the tissue preparing it for use by medical professionals.Where do you get the tissue?As with organ donation a person may register to be a tissue donor such as when they get or renew their driver’s license. Or the person’s family can choose to donate their tissue when they pass away. With a deceased organ donor a number of people can receive organs including the heart lungs and liver. With deceased tissue donors as many as 75 to 100 people can benefit from one donor’s gift.What’s involved in the preparation?It depends on what it’s being used for. We might hear from a doctor helping a person who has been in a car accident and has a spine injury. The doctor may send images of the patient’s spine and ideas of what might be done to help. In a case like that we can shape donated bone or combine several pieces of bone to create a bone graft that will fit that particular patient. As another example we shape skin grafts to fit a breast implant for a woman having breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. We clean the tissue and sometimes treat it with chemicals that remove the cells — a process called decellularization. We also have it tested to make sure it can’t transmit any infection to the person who receives it.

Now Senator John McCain has his own theme song by a music star.“Raising McCain” which focuses on the presumptive Republican nominee’s years in a North Vietnamese prison camp will be performed tonight by its composer John Rich half of the country duo Big & Rich tonight at the Country First Concert in Panama City Beach Fla. (Mr. McCain plans to “stop by.”)“He stayed strong stayed extra long ‘til they let all the other boys out. Now we’ve got a real man with an American plan we’re going to put him in the big White House” are the lyrics to a verse according to The Associated Press. The refrain is “We’re all just raising McCain.”If you don’t catch it tonight we’re sure it’ll be on the candidate’s daughter Meghan’s next country play list. Apparently Mr. Rich knew she was the music fan in the family – he passed it to her first and she brought it to the campaign.

8,A Federal jury today began deliberating the Government's charges against Alcee L. Hastings the first sitting Federal judge to be tried on criminal charges. After deliberating for just over an hour the jury recessed for the night.Judge Hastings is charged with conspiracy to solicit and accept a bribe and obstruction of justice. The case went to the jury after it heard Government prosecutors deny contentions by the 46-year-old defendant Florida's first black Federal judge that the case against him was racially and politically motivated.''The charge that there is something sinister in the prosecution of Judge Hastings is supported by no evidence at all'' the chief Federal prosecutor Reid Weingarten told the jury. ''The suggestion that there is something sinister is nothing but a red herring.''Judge Hastings who has been on the Federal bench for the District of South Florida since December 1979 was indicted in December 1981 along with William A. Borders a longtime friend who is a lawyer from Washington D.C. who was also charged with bribery conspiracy though not with obstruction of justice. The Government says Mr. Borders solicited a $150000 bribe from a man he thought to be a defendant in a racketeering case before Judge Hastings in exchange for favorable rulings by the judge on sentencing and seizure of property.

0,French broadcast industry regulators officially gave the green light today to the inclusion of the Canal Plus pay television group in the $34 billion acquisition of the Seagram Company by the French conglomerate Vivendi.The action came after Vivendi gave assurances that Canal Plus would maintain a high level of independence in its French operations.The deal was formally approved by European antitrust regulators last month but French regulators sought assurances that Canal Plus which is now 49 percent controlled by Vivendi would retain considerable independence in France.Today's announcement removes the last possible hurdle to the deal which was announced five months ago and is to be put to a vote by shareholders on Tuesday.

1,IntroductionJason Kempin/Getty ImagesWhile announcing the renewal of their hit series “Empire” Fox executives said that despite accusations over the years that its star Terrence Howard has assaulted women “our experience with Terrence has been excellent.” Howard said “I’ve grown so much from anything that’s happened in the past” although one allegation was in 2013.Should stars be held more accountable for their behavior? If the N.F.L. is trying to take domestic abuse seriously should Hollywood?
1,Season 2 Episode 5O.K. it’s obvious that writing snippets of a fictional novel so that they can be read aloud on television — a novel whose author we’ve been told is “an incredibly strong writer” — is a losing proposition. They’re never going to be good enough. But when we finally heard bits and pieces of Noah Solloway’s “Descent” on “The Affair” on Sunday night it was hard to have much sympathy for the screenwriter (in this case the playwright Sharr White).“Would she remember him? His voice felt lost in his throat.” “He lifted her skirt just an inch. He paused. They listened together to the sound of the marina hearts shaking in their skin.” “She was sex the very definition of it. She was the reason the word was invented.” From there it just turned pornographic 50 shades of sea foam. The expression on the face of Ruth Wilson as Alison grew progressively darker as she read the manuscript which was supposed to be her response to its growing explicitness but which you’d like to think means that she has more taste than people give her credit for.Alison’s perusal of “Descent” — left out on Yvonne’s work desk — was the dramatic high point of the episode’s first chapter which was devoted to her point of view. Reading the book enraged her because it brought home to her how powerless she was. She’d just been fired as Yvonne’s assistant with a strong hint that it was because of Yvonne’s jealousy fed both by Noah’s book and by how close Yvonne’s husband Robert was getting to Alison. Now she saw herself exploited by Noah depicted as an East End siren with an insatiable sex drive. As she told her ex after she fled back to Montauk “People don’t see me Cole.”The real problem is that “The Affair” itself has never exactly seen her as more than a victim and a bundle of guilt neurosis and small-town working-class awkwardness. (As if you don’t learn a little sophistication growing up in Montauk.) It’s not that her timorousness doesn’t make sense given events but she’s so relentlessly belittled in both the writing and direction that it’s hard to have any real sympathy for her. If she gets out of the subway in Brooklyn she has to be overwhelmed by the city crowd. If she goes into town to run errands for Yvonne she isn’t given the car — she has to be on her rickety bicycle with Yvonne’s packages in a little-girl handlebar basket. When she gets angry she expresses it petulantly and destructively sweeping Yvonne’s books off a shelf. When she helps Robert with his physical therapy the erection he develops is shot in a giggly close-up out of an “American Pie” movie. When she tells Robert the truth about her affair with Noah — already a questionable decision — she uses language like “I felt this bolt of electricity course through me.” Wait maybe that was why she was so upset when she read the manuscript — she actually wrote it!

9,The Chief also earned the enmity of many officers by ejecting them from desk jobs to street duty. Some quit. A One-Man Operation The Chief Meets In the ShadowsIn the spring of 1990 the Chief began an unusual operation of his own one that would arouse the curiosity of a department lawyer and the Connecticut state police but was never made public. He rented rooms at the Holiday Inn in nearby Milford and met there with someone he later described as an informant on Mafia activities.At the same time he said last week he used other rooms at the motel for personal purposes putting up friends at a special rate he was granted and using the swimming pool sometimes with his granddaughter.According to bills reviewed by The New York Times the informant operation cost the department thousands of dollars. The Chief said he never told anyone whom he was meeting with -- he gave conflicting descriptions of the person -- and never stayed overnight. He saved no notes or other record of the meetings but he said last week passed on to his aides information that became the basis of a continuing undercover operation into mob control of several small New Haven businesses. That operation produced several drug buys and would lead to arrests the Chief said. But Assistant Chief Esserman said in a separate interview that the operation had been of little value and should be shut down.An inquiry into the motel expenses began last fall after a lawyer for the Police Department was shown some of the bills by a disaffected police major Thomas P. Muller who questioned whether the chief was using the rooms for personal reasons. The lawyer Glenn Coe a former state prosecutor now in private practice in Hartford was concerned enough to pass the matter on to the state police.Bernard Sullivan who was then State Police Superintendent said recently that at a meeting in his office last November he was told in general terms by the New Haven State's Attorney that Chief Pastore was engaged in a law-enforcement operation and so before starting an investigation dropped the matter with the questions unresolved. The New Haven prosecutor Michael Dearington declined to comment on the matter last week and it remains unclear what he knew of Chief Pastore's use of the rooms.If some officers question the wisdom of a police chief meeting on his own with mob informants Chief Pastore has no qualms. He boasts he had 108 informants when he was detective commander years ago.
1,Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesSATURDAY’S PUZZLE — I just don’t understand some people. If someone you know happens to be a practicing physician wouldn’t you think that the last thing they’d encourage you to consume is a crunchy sticky treat? And yet that’s just what Mark Diehl does today. Shame on you Dr. Diehl. And you call yourself a dentist.It’s so worth it too. I will confess that I used to be afraid of Saturday puzzles but this one while challenging seems friendly. The entries are fabulous a veritable time line of pop culture from mid-20th century right up through the video game generation’s The Legend of ZELDA. They’re not so hard to get that I couldn’t successfully leap to a new sector after I had gotten the previous one to fall. The crossing 15s are wonderful.And oh the wordplay. Today’s puzzle had enough clever misdirection to keep me very happy. It might frustrate some people but I admire a well-turned clue. Take 4 Down. RUES is a word we see a lot in crosswords and it’s usually clued in terms of regret. Not today. “Ways of Charles de Gaulle” is the kind of clue that gives me a double frisson: first when I realize that I don’t know anything about the man de Gaulle especially nothing that is four letters long and will really have to think differently about what I’m seeing; second when I finally fill it in perhaps from the crossings and that smack-yourself-in-the-forehead feeling kicks in when I realize that I’ve been had. Good times.It’s the same with “Cab alternative.” Ever try to hail a taxi in New York City during rush hour? It’s impossible. I’ve seen taxicabs virtually vaporize into thin air when they see someone with their hand out. An alternative maybe a metered magic carpet would be nice. But is Dr. Diehl really talking about a taxicab here? No he is not. Pour yourself a glass of ZIN and ponder that one for a while.I’d never heard of a RAKEHELL but I like the word. Similarly most of American Bandstand’s run took place before my time: did Dick Clark ever refer to his audience as TEENERS?Still a masterful example of what a Saturday puzzle should be. I’m going to go brush my teeth.Your thoughts?

9,All right the eulogies for Richard M. Nixon are over and a great American is buried. But let's not misrepresent the true Nixon gestalt which encompassed not only the grand mastery and malpractice of politics but also some excursions into absurdity. Here was a President of many paradoxes not least of which was his ability (shared by his staff) to seem at once rigidly on top of things and woefully out of touch.The classic example may be Mr. Nixon's brief meeting at the White House with Elvis Presley on Dec. 21 1970 three and a half years before the President's resignation over Watergate and six and a half years before the singer's death amid prescription-drug abuse and self-indulgence. The famous photograph of that encounter -- two men destined for different types of self-destruction -- has become an icon of both the President and the King. More illuminating is the record of the meeting which has been in the public domain since 1986 (unlike many White House records whose release Mr. Nixon successfully fought in court) and is now housed at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project of the National Archives in College Park Md. Here are excerpts. TOM KUNTZ Mailing It Special 'D'Elvis personally delivered a letter seeking a meeting with the President to a White House guard on the morning of the encounter. In Presley's hand it was written on his flight to Washington to judge from the airline stationery used. His intention was to add to his collection of law-enforcement paraphernalia by obtaining the credentials of a Federal agent in the war on drugs (and he was rebuffed in this quest on a visit to the Narcotics Bureau the columnist Jack Anderson later reported): Dear Mr. President:First I would like to introduce myself. I am Elvis Presley and admire you and have Great Respect for your office. I talked to Vice President Agnew in Palm Springs three weeks ago and expressed my concern for our country. The Drug Culture the Hippie Elements the S.D.S. [ Students for a Democratic Society ]  Black Panthers etc. do not consider me as their enemy or as they call it the Establishment. I call it America and I love it. . . . I have no concerns or motives other than helping the country out. So I wish not to be given a title or an appointed position. I can and will do more good if I were made a Federal Agent at Large and I will help out by doing it my through my communications with people of all ages. . . . I am on this plane with Sen. George Murphy [ of California ] and we have been discussing the problems that our country is faced with.Sir I am staying at the Washington Hotel Room 505-506-507 -- I have 2 men who work with me by the name of Jerry Schilling and Sonny West. I am registered under the name of Jon Burrows. I will be here for as long as it takes to get the credentials of a Federal Agent. I have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing techniques and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where I can and will do the most good.
9,After getting knocked out in a non-title bout at Atlantic City yesterday the junior middleweight BUDDY McGIRT announced he was retiring. McGirt 31 dropped to 64-5-1 after being floored by ANDREW COUNCIL in the ninth round of the scheduled 10-round bout."The punches mounted up" said McGirt a two-time world champion. "I knew I was definitely behind. After the first knockdown I thought 'Who turned out the lights?'

9,Ms. Stewart makes an easy target having held out an ideal of butter-churn perfection in these microwave times. (''I really want people to get out their sewing machines again'' she once opined. ''I know we don't have time but just thinking about it is a step in the right direction.'') Notions like these border so closely on satire that a parody of her magazine Martha Stewart Living showed how homeless people could garden in grocery carts and take advantage of shifting sunlight. Mr. Oppenheimer whose last book was an equally uncharitable look at Ethel Kennedy goes further by also sniping at Ms. Stewart for the kind of ambition and tenacity that might be lauded in a biography of Bill Gates.Naturally her ego the writer's cruelty and our own complicity (as the mulch in which Ms. Stewart's empire grew) have sent this unauthorized biography flying out of stores. And there's not a beach in America where such a colorful feat of character assassination won't be met by at least surreptitious interest. For if Mr. Oppenheimer has done dirty work he has done his homework too. He presents Ms. Stewart as a tireless unscrupulous self-promoter who in creating the corporate omelet that is now Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia has broken many an egg.Little fibs come back to haunt her throughout this account even in her description of her first apartment with Andy Stewart her husband and later the publisher of her phenomenally successful illustrated books. She wrote of how three pale-blue pet birds fluttered charmingly throughout the love nest perching on her pencil while Mr. Oppenheimer notes that the place was bleak and the birds died grim deaths. (Ms. Stewart herself described the place as ''three miserable rooms overlooking the rooftops of 114th Street'' in a 1987 USA Today article.)When the Stewarts began commuting to a weekend house and creating the country-squire fantasy that would prove so lucrative this too involved more stress than romance. ''She would say to Andy 'Go dig a well or a cesspool' '' an on-the-record source says.'' Another presumable ex-friend recalls the Stewarts' fastidiously oiling their wood-burning stove.Moving from recreational housekeeping (and a career as a stockbroker) into professional catering Ms. Stewart developed the new hobby of assuming credit for her collaborators' work. While supplying prepared food to a Westport Conn. shop she was described as the place's proprietor in a newspaper article. The owners who then dismissed her say she showed up armed with a dictionary and tried to insist that proprietor was another way of saying manager. Later after she hired Elizabeth Hawes to write her first book ''Entertaining'' she allowed the author's credit to read: ''By Martha Stewart text with Elizabeth Hawes.'' Ms. Hawes didn't get a ''text by'' credit and didn't get invited to the Westport publication party.

1,Jim Wilson/The New York TimesWith a real-world profit and an inexhaustible supply of virtual cows Zynga on Friday filed for what is expected to be one of the biggest Internet stock offerings ever a debut whose fate is tied largely to that of Facebook’s.Zynga the online gaming company behind the Facebook hits FarmVille and CityVille said on Friday that it expected to raise about $1 billion in an initial public offering a figure used to calculate the registration fee. But Zynga’s ambitions may be significantly higher. The company is expected to ultimately offer up to 10 percent of its shares at a valuation near or above $20 billion people briefed on the matter said.For some of the biggest Web start-ups there is a growing sense of urgency to capitalize on the booming investor interest in new Internet stocks — as evidenced by the blockbuster debut of the professional social network LinkedIn in May.Groupon the giant daily deals site filed last month for its offering. Its rival LivingSocial is said to be speaking with bankers about an offering. And the juggernaut of the group Facebook is expected to file this year at a valuation above $100 billion according to two people close to the matter.Some clues to Facebook’s business model may be found in Zynga’s performance. As the largest game developer on Facebook Zynga accounts for many of its page views and more important the sale of virtual items.Zynga’s filing shows how a business built on virtual goods like animated sheep and Tuscan villas can be so lucrative. The company offers its games free but makes the bulk of its revenue from a small percentage of users who spend money on virtual goods to enhance their stature in its games. Online ads account for a sliver of revenue.Its colorful cartoonish games most of which are played through Facebook attract 148 million unique visitors a month across 166 countries.Although Zynga started with a poker game in 2007 it has become best known for creating virtual world games that attract a broad base of users. Many of its top offerings encourage players to build manipulate and share their virtual worlds with friends. Its reliance on Facebook is no accident. Early in Zynga’s history Mark Pincus the company’s 45-year-old founder and chief executive focused on Facebook and quickly learned how to leverage the platform and its sharing functions to maximize the viral nature of Zynga’s games.“Mark saw that this was going to be a land grab” said Lou Kerner a Wedbush Securities analyst. “Now they can advertise their new games to this giant base and that gives them a huge marketing advantage.”The model has become a powerful cash machine. While many players never pay a dime Zynga sells about 38000 virtual items every second. The company swung to a profit last year $90.6 million. Revenue meanwhile roughly quadrupled to $597.5 million. As of the end of March Zynga had $995.6 million in cash on hand.And while Zynga has competitors in online gaming including stalwarts like Electronic Arts so far no rival has been able to shake its dominance on Facebook. Of the social network’s top five games four are Zynga’s. CityVille is most popular with 88 million active users. The No. 2 game Empires and Allies has more than 45 million monthly active users and it was introduced just a month ago.And yet its success on Facebook also underscores its vulnerabilities.While Zynga has prospered its dependence on Facebook represents one of the greatest threats to the game maker. The vast majority of Zynga’s revenue courses through the Facebook pipeline. In the risk factors section of its filing Zynga warns investors that “if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Facebook our business will suffer.”At times the relationship has been challenged by disputes over Facebook Credits the site’s virtual currency system and changes to the site’s notification system. Tensions flared last year over Facebook Credits which effectively take a 30 percent “tax” from virtual good purchases but the companies reached a five-year agreement in May to keep the marriage intact. (Notably the company’s revenue figures are net of Facebook’s cut.)“I think that’s the major risk in the story” said Mr. Kerner of Wedbush Securities. “They do exist at the whim of Facebook but it’s certainly in Facebook’s own self-interest to have a vibrant gaming ecosystem.”Over the last year Zynga has signaled to the markets that it is trying to become more independent. The company has signed partnerships with other portals like Yahoo and it has poured more resources into gaming on mobile devices.According to the filing proceeds of the offering will mainly be used for general expenses including the development of games and marketing. In an investor letter Mr. Pincus specified that he planned to continue to make big investments “in servers data centers and other infrastructure.” And in a sign that Zynga will continue to be active in acquisitions — the company has made more than a dozen deals in the last year— Mr. Pincus said he planned “to fund the best teams around the world to build the most accessible social and fun games.”The growing war chest will come in handy as expenses mount. As Zynga expands beyond Facebook and grapples with the natural evolution of social games — which are becoming more complicated as user tastes change — the company will be forced to spend more money on development according to analysts.Over the last year the company which is based in San Francisco has hired hundreds of developers and now has a staff of more than 2000 people. According to the filing its cost of research and development roughly tripled to $149.5 million last year.When Zynga finally does go public top executives and its venture capital investors will see their fortunes surge. Mr. Pincus whose stake will be worth several billion dollars and represent the largest voting block will also keep a firm grip on the company he founded.In its filing Zynga outlined a three-class stock structure that favors Mr. Pincus’s voting rights. Public shareholders will receive class A shares with one vote per share. Meanwhile Zynga’s current owners the holders of class B and C shares will carry stock with several votes per share. Mr. Pincus who owns all of the class C shares will see his voting power increase over time as class B shareholders sell their shares according to two people close to the company who were familiar with the matter.The filing revealed that Mr. Pincus who sold stock worth nearly $110 million earlier this year still owns some 91 million shares of Zynga’s class B stock or 16 percent of that class. Kleiner Perkins is the next largest shareholder with 11 percent of class B stock and five other venture capital firms own at least 5 percent. In total the filing showed Zynga’s employees and directors own 33.6 percent of the company’s class B stock. It is not known how many of those shares will be sold during the offering.The filing also disclosed executives’ compensation as well as one quirky add-on. Reginald D. Davis senior vice president and general counsel received $615000 in cash bonuses and a paid trip to an out-of-town concert which the company said it gave to Mr. Davis “in recognition of his dedication and long hours worked in 2009 and 2010.”Kevin Roose and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

1,For the past three and a half years Republicans have struggled to explain a great conundrum. If they are the party of authentic America with a mystical connection to the will of the people then how exactly did Barack Obama get elected president?Some Republicans have come up with an answer that allows them to avoid facing the unpleasant reality of their own party’s failures: Obama must be a great deceiver. He won the White House by subterfuge.Claims that Obama concealed nonnative birth or faith in Islam failed to gain mainstream traction but conservatives like Sean Hannity were more successful in labeling Obama as covertly “anti-American” based on his association with the incendiary pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. By this logic Obama was a paragon of Christian piety. He “savored” every word on Sunday mornings and would surely govern by these traitorous principles: his beliefs were dangerous because well he really believed them.Now his critics have reversed course: they say Obama is a sham Christian. He thinks religion is not heartfelt belief that demands full expression but only a matter of showing up at church. He is not the first president to stand so accused: in the election of 1800 one clergyman charged Thomas Jefferson with “disbelief of the Holy Scriptures” and Abraham Lincoln battled the suggestion that he was a “scoffer of Christianity.”But Obama’s opponents have a new twist on this old allegation. They find evidence for his unbelief not by exposing his biblical illiteracy or shoddy church attendance but in his failure to support “religious freedom.”Religious freedom is as American as apple pie isn’t it? How could anyone oppose it? Because — this line of reasoning goes — Obama is not who he says he is. He claims to be a true Christian and a true American but his actions prove otherwise.The charge that the president is a faker on religious freedom is the most recent iteration of the ongoing attack on his legitimacy: it is the new “birther” movement. It’s also a decades-old rhetorical tool of the culture wars intended to depict the entire left as frauds who supposedly stand for a tolerant open society but who are in fact disciples of a secular pseudo-religion intent on quashing Christian influence in America.The Rev. Franklin Graham who has always been more provocative than his prudent father Billy told MSNBC last week that the president lacks sufficient outrage over the plight of persecuted Christians. “Islam has gotten a free pass under Obama” Graham said adding that the Muslim world sees Obama as “a son of Islam” who will not challenge religious oppression. “The Muslims of the world — he seems to be more concerned about them than the Christians that are being murdered in the Muslim countries – that’s what bothers me.” (Graham offered a half-apology on Tuesday saying he regretted any comments that “cast any doubt on the personal faith of our president.”)During the recent outcry over the Obama administration’s new rule requiring religious employers to cover birth control in their insurance plans Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney blasted the president too: here was proof of Obama’s aim to oppress religious expression and trample constitutional rights.Last week at a rally at a Christian college in Michigan Rick Santorum called the president “particularly weak” on religious freedom. He insisted that “freedom of religion” is much more than “freedom of worship” confined within a church’s four walls which even “tyrants” support. “When you have the president of the United States referring to freedom of religion and you have the secretary of state referring to the freedom of religion not as the freedom of religion but the freedom of worship you should get very very nervous” he warned.When conservatives cry “freedom of religion” and insist they mean something more than “freedom of worship” this is what they mean: religious freedom is not just the freedom to gather in a room and pray one morning a week. It is the freedom to impose one’s own religious values on others. Free expression of religion entails the right to reason from religious principles in the public square and — with sufficient electoral support — to enshrine those principles in law and social institutions. If Obama does not support this view they argue then he is hardly a true American.Over the course of American history “religious freedom” has been a shape-shifter invoked just as often in the name of prejudice (in 19th-century Protestant campaigns against Catholic schools; in fundamentalist colleges’ racial discrimination a hundred years later) as on behalf of liberty. It is a code phrase alternately benign and sinister much like that other clever cloak for bigotry “states’ rights.” In the context of the 2012 race the charge that Obama subverts religious freedom is a code meant to label the president as an impostor a blasphemer of the American gospel who adheres to another religion entirely.Santorum has hit this theme the hardest warning that conservative Christians must not be fooled by the president’s efforts to play the neutral statesman who treats all believers equally. On the contrary he obeys a false religion with nonnegotiable assumptions of its own. Santorum described Obama’s environmentalism as a “phony theology” and a “worldview.”This is an attempt to paint as irrationally ideological a president who has proven himself to be not very ideological at all (much to the frustration of his supporters on the left). It is a culture warrior’s maneuver to cast American politics as a Manichean battleground between two worldviews — red-blooded Christian America pitted against the secularist stranger — worldviews so captive to their own logic that they cannot possibly compromise on anything.This obsession with “worldviews” has been a favorite tactic of the Christian right. In the 1970s Francis Schaeffer and other activists taught evangelicals to organize against the “secular humanist worldview” that was denaturing America’s Christian values in an acid bath of “humanist religion” “an exclusivist closed system which shuts out all contending viewpoints” (that’s the “phony theology” that Santorum was talking about).Schaeffer’s admirers often note that he defends religious freedom in his 1981 book “A Christian Manifesto.” But after Schaeffer called for “general religious freedom” for all faiths he went on to lament the left’s manipulation of the First Amendment to encourage a “new concept of pluralism” in which “there is no right or wrong; it is just a matter of your personal preference.”To recover America’s biblical foundation Christians had to “do battle on the entire front:” not just in church but in the courts classrooms outside abortion clinics and everywhere else Schaeffer wrote. The emerging Christian right asserted that this was the true meaning of “religious freedom” in America: freedom to institutionalize Christian dogma in American society and law. Freedom of religion — a phrase that sounds at first blush like a bipartisan nod to our common political heritage — is a weapon of culture war.Slogans like this have political power. Voters on both the right and the left have little sympathy for politicians who reason through problems and recognize ambiguity (conservatives won’t forgive Romney for his honest struggles with the abortion issue and Obama faces liberal wrath for his nuanced approach to economic recovery). Wonkish debates are boring and complicated and not very good for separating the sheep from the goats. What matters are your “presuppositions” your “worldview.”Conservatives’ accusations that Obama disrespects religious freedom have little to do with the White House’s actual policy: his administration has a strong track record in supporting faith-based organizations and ensuring that prisoners have access to religious literature for example. They have everything to do with resurrecting old challenges to the president’s legitimacy and framing the 2012 campaign as a battle between honest Christian Americans and atheist subversives. “Enemy of religious freedom” is shorthand for a deceiver who is not one of us: in Gingrich’s words one who “played a wonderful con as a result of which he is now president.”Molly Worthen teaches religious history at the University of Toronto.

9,The jury's mixed verdict in the deaths of four of the Treasury agents who raided the Branch Davidian compound near Waco Tex. has dealt another mortifying blow to Federal law enforcement. Just about the only person who does not view the verdict as a rebuke to the massive and unnecessary police action is Attorney General Janet Reno.The raid a year ago yesterday was botched as were most of the Government's efforts to arrange the surrender of the heavily armed cultist David Koresh. Along with dozens of his followers and their children Mr. Koresh perished last April in a fiery response to a final raid by the F.B.I.The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms launched its February attack even though it knew that the Davidians fully expected it. That would seem to suggest the cultists engaged in premeditated murder. But no; all 11 defendants were acquitted of murder. The jury did convict five defendants of manslaughter holding them responsible for the deaths of the agents.Under the judge's instruction the lesser manslaughter verdict was justified if the accused acted "in the sudden heat of passion caused by adequate provocation." Thus the jury credited the five convicted cultists with an element of self-defense.

7,tonal guidance specialists this is known as hitting the daily double.If Commissioner Kennedy has come a fair piece from his beginnings so has professional roundball. It was 26 years ago when Walter Kennedy press agent for the N.B.A.'s fledgling predecessor the Basketball Association of America arranged a luncheon meeting between Maurice Podoloff the organization's president and Harold Rosenthal who was writing a profile of basketball's infant czar for the New York Herald Tribune. Telephoning later to make sure the interview had gone well Kennedy asked “Where did he take you to lunch?”“I hate to tell you” Rosenthal said. “We sat at the counter in Lindy's spa” (a luncheonette on 53d Street long since vanished in a cloud of bicarbonate). When the N.B.A. held a news conference the other day to announce the extension and reinforcement of the commissioner's powers the meeting was held in the alcoholic opulence of Twenty One.The decision to strengthen Kennedy's hand was news worthy on two counts. For one the action was unanimous and it is a rare day in November when those 17 club owners agree on what time it is. For another in conferring the robe and scepter of absolute monarchy on their leader they were running directly counter to current trends.Twilight of the CzarsIn most professional sports the bottom has just about dropped out of the czar business. The first and toughest of the overlords was Landis who came to power in 1920 and ruled with a heavy hand until his death in 1944. But if baseball started with Little Caesar it wound up with Ethelred the Unready.

9,THE Devils live. They go to Ottawa for tomorrow night's sixth game. But even with their 3-1 victory last night their future remains in jeopardy because their four-of-seven-game Stanley Cup playoff series remains a mystery: The Case of the Missing Goals.In finishing first in the Eastern Conference the Devils scored 225 goals a respectable ninth among National Hockey League teams. But in five games with eighth-seeded Ottawa the Devils have scored only 11 goals including one empty-net goal.To advance in the playoffs the Devils will need Martin Brodeur at his best as he was last night.Insisting ''We do have the scorers'' Coach Jacques Lemaire mentioned Doug Gilmour Dave Andreychuk Bobby Holik Randy McKay Steve Thomas Brian Rolston Patrik Elias Jason Arnott and Brendan Morrison. But of that group only Gilmour and Andreychuk had scored before Rolston's short-handed goal last night.Gilmour with the clincher last night now has five goals (including the empty-netter) Andreychuk one. Bobby Carpenter Denis Pederson and two defensemen Lyle Odelein last night and Scott Stevens produced the other goals.

8,Six former owners and employees of two Manhattan after-hours clubs were indicted yesterday on charges that they evaded liquor and tax laws and then conspired to impede investigations of those crimes.Attorney General Robert Abrams in announcing the indictments said the six men had operated the clubs ''with a complete disregard for the liquor and tax laws'' and that they ''conspired to bribe and coerce witnesses in order to frustrate our investigation.''Three of the men - who prosecutors said were principals of the clubs the Mine Shaft and Hell Fire - already face charges under an indictment in December stating that they tried to bribe a witness to leave the state so that he could not testify in the investigation. Yesterday's indictment included those earlier allegations.Both the Mine Shaft a club at 835 Washington Street that chiefly catered to homosexuals and Hell Fire a mainly heterosexual club at 26 Ninth Avenue near West 13th Street have been closed since last fall. The Mine Shaft was closed by the city in November under the so-called ''safe sex'' regulations that were issued last year to curb the spread of AIDS. Hell Fire closed voluntarily shortly afterward.

8,Adjustable rates which became commonplace in home mortgages as interest rates soared are fast becoming fixtures in auto loans the backbone of the consumer loan industry.Jerry Alderman Ford in Indianapolis for example was one of the first to offer the new loans starting two years ago. ''I can count on one hand the number of times our customers have gone the fixed-rate route'' Steven Edging vice president and general manager said. ''Variable- rate loans are here to stay.''John R. Gilker Ford's manager of marketing and credit said Ford's move was ''an experiment to test the market reaction; this is an idea that's taking hold in certain parts of the country and we want to be competitive with the marketplace.''In a fixed-rate loan borrowers know how much they will repay at what interest rate. But in an adjustable- or variable-rate loan whether for a house or car the interest rate and thus the final cost may change.

0,Chrysler is the first major automaker since Studebaker in 1933 to try to reorganize in bankruptcy and emerge as a viable company. The process can be complicated. The New York Times’s Micheline Maynard takes a quick look at how it is likely to play out.Q. Is Chrysler going out of business?A. No. Chrysler is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The law allows companies to shed assets restructure debt cancel contracts and close operations that normally would have to continue running. Once they secure financing to emerge from bankruptcy these companies are reconstituted as new legal entities.Should Chrysler fail to successfully reorganize it might turn to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy which would mean a liquidation.Q. How long will this take?A. The Obama administration spoke of a “surgical bankruptcy” that it said could be completed in 30 to 60 days. It plans to use Section 363 of the bankruptcy code to sell assets rid the company of liabilities and restructure its debt creating a new Chrysler.In reality most bankruptcies take much longer. United Airlines spent more than three years under bankruptcy protection. Delphi the auto parts supplier has been in Chapter 11 since 2005. The bankruptcy by LTV a steel maker took seven years to resolve.Bankruptcy law changed in 2005 to give management of a company the exclusive right to draft a plan of reorganization. A judge can extend that period exclusivity for 18 months but creditors or potential buyers for a company can present a competing plan once that period expires.Q. What happens to Chrysler dealers?A. Chrysler is able under bankruptcy to cancel franchise agreements with its dealers and the government said that would happen. Dealers can sue to block the action but a final decision would be up to the judge. In the meantime Chrysler will continue to provide dealers with vehicles to sell.Chrysler Financial will cease making consumer loans for Chrysler vehicles; GMAC with support from the government will provide financing through Chrysler dealers.Q. What happens to Chrysler employees?A. The White House said it did not expect any reductions in white- or blue-collar jobs as a result of the bankruptcy. However Chrysler employees who are not union members do not have any job security. The company can ask a judge for an immediate pay cut for its salaried employees and can announce job eliminations and close offices just as it can outside bankruptcy.Contracts covering members of the United Automobile Workers union and other unions will remain in force until the company asks a judge to void them. U.A.W. members approved changes to their contract on Wednesday that presumably would mean the contract would stay in place.But if the company asked for contracts to be terminated and replaced with terms it can more readily afford the union would have a chance to respond in court. Negotiations would take place before any cuts were imposed. This process could take months.Q. Are pensions and retiree health care benefits protected?A. Companies have the right under bankruptcy law to ask to terminate their pension plans. If such a request was made a judge would convene a brief trial on the subject and hear both sides. If pensions were terminated employees would still receive about one-third of their benefits through financing from the federal pension agency.A company also can eliminate retiree health care benefits for nonunion employees; they would subsequently be covered by Medicare. The U.A.W. and Chrysler agreed in 2007 to transfer responsibility for union retiree health care to a special fund and the fund would administer those retiree benefits.Q. What happens to Chrysler suppliers?A. In its bankruptcy filing Chrysler listed its 50 biggest creditors holding unsecured claims meaning those that would have to get in line behind creditors whose debt is secured by collateral like the company’s plants brands and other assets. The unsecured creditors include its advertising agency BBDO and parts suppliers like Johnson Controls Magna International and Cummins Engine.The White House said supplier contracts would remain in force and it has created a program to provide federal help to parts makers. But in bankruptcy supplier contracts can be canceled.Chrysler is likely to tell the court which suppliers it wants to keep doing business with and which contracts it wants to reject. Suppliers could challenge the rejection of their contract but most likely they would have to reach a settlement with Chrysler.Q. What happens next in the bankruptcy case?A. Chrysler filed its initial paperwork with the federal bankruptcy court in New York on Thursday. On Friday it will ask a judge to issue a series of rulings called the first day orders which allow the company to keep operating. They may include authorizing the payment of routine expenses like salaries and payments to vendors including its lawyers and whatever else Chrysler needs to run its business. Chrysler said it would halt production while it completes a deal with Fiat.Once the case begins Chrysler can ask a judge to issue an emergency order to temporarily reduce salaries which is meant to conserve its cash. A committee will also be formed that represents Chrysler’s creditors.Q. Should owners of Chrysler cars and trucks be concerned?A. The federal government said it would back the warranties on vehicles bought from Chrysler while it is operating in bankruptcy. So effective Thursday warranties are underwritten by the government.Owners of Chrysler vehicles bought before Thursday should expect their warranties to be honored until they expire. But the work may not be performed by a Chrysler dealer. Companies operating in bankruptcy sometimes ask a judge to let them assign warranty repairs to outside vendors who charge the company less for their work than a dealer would expect to be reimbursed.Owners whose vehicle warranties have run out are liable for any problems with their cars and trucks as they are now.Go to Article from The New York Times »

9,The Federal Government's first comprehensive study of whether giving clean needles to addicts can help prevent the spread of AIDS has concluded that it does and that the Government should finance a significant expansion of such programs.The Federal panel reviewed programs in the United States Canada and Europe in which drug abusers can turn in a used needle and get a fresh sterile one. The chief object of these programs is to end the drug abuser's need to share syringes that may have become contaminated with blood carrying the AIDS virus.The panel concluded that needle exchange programs had not resulted in any measurable increase in drug abuse in their neighborhoods. It also found that addicts in exchange programs share needles less often and are more likely to clean their needles with bleach.Needle exchange programs in the United States have been in a legal limbo over the past five years. A patchwork of state and Federal laws including a Federal ban on financing such programs and state laws that prohibit the possession of needles or purchase of needles without a prescription severely restrict such initiatives in 47 states and the District of Columbia. 5 Million Needles
9,Mr. Goldhagen describes the members of Police Battalion 101 a kind of reserve unit assigned to do police work in the conquered territories as ordinary German husbands and fathers. They were told by their commanders that they did not have to kill Jews. Still they entered into a "Dantesque production" of killing immersing themselves in blood and inviting their wives and children to watch. It was Mr. Goldhagen writes as if humanity had entered "a new moral order."But their actions he says were the result of a German society saturated with anti-Semitism. Even Karl Barth the Swiss theologian who taught in Germany in the early 30's and became an opponent of Nazism had "a deep-seated anti-Semitism" Mr. Goldhagen writes. Barth denounced Jews in a 1933 sermon as "an obstinate and evil people" Mr. Goldhagen adds."Most anti-Semites just want to get Jews out of the country but to Germans Jews were metaphysical enemies" Mr. Goldhagen said in his office. Some Germans protested the killing of Poles Mr. Goldhagen notes and of handicapped people but not of Jews. Even members of the anti-Hitler Resistance were anti-Semitic. Finally when Heinrich Himmler chief of the SS hoping to negotiate with Americans at the end of World War II forbade the further killing of Jews some Germans kept on.In many ways Mr. Goldhagen's book is a search for answers to unanswerable questions. He is the son of Erich Goldhagen a survivor of the Romanian-Jewish ghetto in Czernowitz now in Ukraine. The elder Goldhagen recently retired as a professor from Harvard where for 25 years he taught a course on the Holocaust. Daniel Goldhagen dedicates his book to his father his "constant discussion partner.""My father said almost nothing about his own time" Daniel Goldhagen said. "It was simply very painful. He lost most of his extended family."Recently Erich Goldhagen said from Cambridge: "I'm a survivor. I don't like to talk about my experiences for obvious reasons." Yet he said "Our house was saturated in the subject." In the Goldhagen household Daniel Goldhagen said the Holocaust was not a tale to lament. "The framework was intellectual."The second oldest of four children Daniel Goldhagen grew up in Newton Mass. where he played high school basketball. "I still read the sports page first thing" he said.

9,With eight days to go before classes in New York City's public schools are scheduled to resume officials said yesterday that they could not complete the emergency inspection program for asbestos in time to open all schools.The officials who insisted on anonymity said that at best they would be able to declare only some of the city's 1069 schools free of asbestos hazards and ready to open on the first day of school Sept. 9.The inability to complete the emergency inspection ordered by Mayor David N. Dinkins on Aug. 6 now creates a major problem for city officials and the new Schools Chancellor Raymond C. Cortines whose appointment was approved by the Board of Education last night. [ Page B2. ]Norman Steisel the First Deputy Mayor said that officials could not rule out having to postpone the first day of school for all the city's 1 million schoolchildren.

9,President Bush will extend formal recognition to Latvia Lithuania and Estonia on Monday regardless of whether the Soviet legislature acts to grant Baltic independence by then Administration officials said today.The officials said that although Mr. Bush had been withholding formal recognition of the three republics out of deference to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev he had decided that he is giving Soviet legislators enough time to act."We wanted to give them a respectable grace period so if we had to act on our own nobody could complain that we did it precipitously" one official said.The American officials' comments today appeared to be a clear effort to prod Soviet legislators. The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies meets in Moscow on Monday. It would have a full working day to act even if Mr. Bush were to make such an announcement as early as mid-morning on Monday here because Moscow time is seven hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time.
0,India's economy soared 10.4 percent in the final quarter of 2003 making it one of the fastest growing in the world even ahead of China.The last quarter's rise up from an 8.4 percent pace in the previous quarter was driven mainly by an expansion of nearly 17 percent in farm output. Last season the country benefited from the heaviest monsoon rains in over a decade. Farming accounts for a quarter of India's economy.The Center for Monitoring of the Indian Economy based in Mumbai said in its monthly review released Wednesday that overall gross domestic product earlier forecast at around 8 percent would probably be above 9 percent in the government's fiscal year ending this month.But the jump which makes India the fastest-growing Asian economy is unlikely to continue.''I would not get too excited about the double digits because there is a big skew in farm output this year which is unlikely to repeat'' said Jyotivardhan Jaipuria head of research at DSP Merrill Lynch.

9,THE injuries that sidelined Wendell Davis of the Chicago Bears and Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins this year could have been prevented says an inventor who has come up with a new approach to football cleats.Harry Max Weiss 60 a patent attorney and sports fan in Scottsdale Ariz. said he had formulated his invention patented last week while watching instant replays of players being injured on "Monday Night Football."Mr. Weiss said football shoe cleats which provide traction and give better footing also prevent the shoe from moving when a player is hit. The torque when a player is hit he said is the cause of many injuries especially to the knee which among National Football League players is the body part most likely to be hurt."The players' feet are planted in one direction and their knees are being pushed in another direction" Mr. Weiss said. "It's clear you need a way to release the cleat."

1,JACKSONVILLE Fla. — Even with one more win Bobby Bowden couldn’t gain ground on Penn State’s Joe Paterno the coach with the most career victories in the Football Bowl Subdivision. At the same time Florida State was beating West Virginia 33-21 in Bowden’s swan song at the Gator Bowl Paterno’s Nittany Lions were holding off L.S.U. 19-17 at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando.Paterno 82 has 394 victories. Bowden 80 ended his 55-year coaching career with 389 but stands to lose as many as 14 of those because of academic misconduct.“I wanted 400 so bad” Bowden said “because I felt like well Joe is going to beat me. When they took away those games Joe is going to beat me. And if I could just get to 400 it would be me and him. I could hang around with him and follow him around a little bit.”Bowden who has coached the past 34 seasons at Florida State was forced to resign at the end of the Seminoles’ 6-6 regular season. He will be replaced by the offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher. Bowden wished to coach one more year so he could reach the 400-win milestone. Despite not being able to go out on his own terms Bowden said he is at peace.“I’m not ate up with coaching football at my life” he said. “I have got 80 years in. I wanted 81 but I got 80 years in. I wanted more and couldn’t have it. They wouldn’t let me have it.”He added: “I have always felt like you can’t take it with you. If I want more games than anybody else which I’m not Joe is so what? When I die I can’t take it with me. There are things in life more important. There are just things more important than that to me. That’s why I’m at peace with myself.”He said he was reminded after the game that victories aren’t everything. In the locker room Bowden’s players asked him to sign their jerseys and he was able to spend a few minutes with former players like Derrick Brooks and Chris Weinke one of two Heisman Trophy winners that Bowden coached.“It is a great closeness there” Bowden said. “It’s is like a family. And I really appreciate all those boys coming back to the game.”
9,CURRY is the chameleon of the table. It not only comes in assorted colors -- yellow red and green -- but also can transform an ordinary dish into something aromatic and exotic. Shuffle the seasonings and an Indian dish can take on a Thai Burmese or Caribbean personality. It can even taste French. Now as Americans hanker for ever-spicier foods curries of all sorts are becoming more common here.Since 1987 according to the American Spice Trade Association sales of cumin and turmeric the two main components of curry have risen strikingly up 65 percent for cumin which gives curry its aromatic slightly bitter intensity and 40 percent for turmeric the dried root that gives yellow curry its color. Curry's heat comes from pepper and chilies and their sales are also skyrocketing.The standard yellow curry powder though is just one of many seasonings now available. Increasingly stores are stocking curries from a number of countries in both "dry" or powdered form and "wet" or paste. Among the new wet seasonings available in stores now are Indian curries like Instant India and Curry King. Two of the many brands of Thai varieties are Taste of Thai and Thai Chef. Some of these products are made in the United States while others are imported not only from Asia but also from Canada where two interesting brands of Indian-style pastes are Himalayan Gourmet and Shahi.Aside from being wet or dry yellow (with turmeric) red (with red chilies) or green (hotter with green chilies) curries also fall into two other categories: for tourists and for purists.

8,Scott Turow the author of the best-selling novel ''Presumed Innocent'' has been strongly chastised by a Federal appeals court for his actions as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago in the early 1980's.In a ruling dated Nov. 16 and stamped ''Do Not Publish'' a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta found that Mr. Turow may have obstructed justice by using a criminal defense lawyer as an informant against his own client. At the end of the 13-page ruling a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times the judges ordered the case sent to the United States Attorney in Miami for possible action.Ana T. Barnett the Chief Assistant United States Attorney in Miami said the Office of Public Integrity of the Department of Justice had been asked to review the case.Mr. Turow whose novel deals with a Midwest prosecutor who is falsely accused of murder criticized the opinion of the appellate court as ''disgraceful and lacking legal or factual basis.'' Speaking from Chicago where he is a lawyer with the firm of Sonnenschein Carlin Nath & Rosenthal Mr. Turow said that he also had asked for a Justice Department review and that his actions had been approved by his superiors.

0,The op-ed results suggest that an argument is raging in the country. But the journalistic sorting out of the facts that should inform that argument has diminished.The deeper connections between Mr. Bush's political vision and the country that are most intriguing and significant are largely absent in the press treatment. Despite so tenuous a mandate for his bold conservative agenda the press has largely ignored the subject of his relationship to the American public. Indeed in Mr. Bush's first two months in office the news outlets we surveyed featured only half as many stories on how presidential policies relate to the American people as they did in Mr. Clinton's early days.The coverage already shrunken has focused on the most obvious and routine elements of Mr. Bush's new tenure.In his first month the coverage was positive. It focused on quick judgments about whether Mr. Bush was up to the job -- and declared that the answer after low expectations was yes.In the second month the coverage turned more critical as Mr. Bush's budget plan began to move through Congress. The coverage turned more negative however not because it keenly considered where the president wanted to take the country and how this would affect people but because the budget plan seemed entangled in Congress. Mr. Bush's ideas in other words are being dealt with on the level probably least interesting to citizens -- the level of political jockeying.What is missing in the picture are answers to the deeper questions most citizens -- except perhaps news junkies -- are concerned with: What change will the election and the crisis over voting bring? What are the implications of a president who lost the popular vote attempting to govern as if he had won it by a wide margin? How is it that Mr. Bush a man depicted during the campaign as an affable deal maker not too concerned with policy has emerged in the coverage as a sincere conservative willing to stake out a controversial agenda because he is so committed ideologically?The consequences of the press further pulling back its coverage of the public debate -- now even of the White House -- are not trivial. Shrunken coverage leads to a shallower public understanding more chance of abuse by special interests and less chance for the country to resolve its most difficult problems.Not long ago David Shribman a journalist with The Boston Globe reminded a group of journalism executives of how parents often define character for their children: it's how you act when no one is looking. The definition of character in journalism Mr. Shribman said was whether we cover stories we think people aren't paying attention to but should be.

9,To the Editor:An Aug. 30 Week in Review article places the onus for our global economic problems on lack of political leadership citing a number of academics but no economists. The economist Milton Friedman recently appeared on ''Moneyline News Hour With Lou Dobbs'' to deplore the role of the politically controlled International Monetary Fund saying that it has aggravated the economic situation rather than improved it. He called for market solutions not political solutions.Adam Smith's invisible hand is less dramatic than a magic wand but economics has not taught us to do magic tricks with our economy. Capitalism is capable of self-correction and continuing economic progress while collectivist political alternatives have proved to be no answer at all.LAWRENCE CRANBERGAustin Tex. Aug. 31 1998

8,Roughly one-quarter of the legislators from New York City and other areas served by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were absent Tuesday when the State Legislature voted to approve a financing package to rebuild the mass-transit system.No one has suggested that the outcome would have been different if the missing legislators had been present. The plan passed by a large margin in both houses. But citizen groups and others were critical.''They figured the votes were there to pass what needed to be passed'' said Paul H. Elisha executive director of the New York State branch of Common Cause a citizen advocacy group. ''But at a time when there's a great deal of discussion about raises for legislators a full-time Legislature the whole manner in which this special session was handled shows a very cavalier attitude on the part of legislators to the needs of the constituents. One would hope that that's not a bellwether for the year to come.'' #30 Absentees Recorded Of the 40 state senators who represent the 12-county area served by the M.T.A. 11 were officially listed as absent or ''excused.'' And in the Assembly which has 94 members whose districts fall within the M.T.A. service area 19 members were similarly listed.The counties served by the M.T.A. include the five of New York City as well as Nassau Suffolk Westchester Rockland Orange Dutchess and Putnam.
0,But by making Mr. Humeston's testimony an issue Ms. Sullivan has taken some of the jury's attention off internal Merck e-mail messages and documents that show that company scientists were concerned about Vioxx's heart risks before sales began. And jurors appeared to be paying close attention to Ms. Sullivan's argument that Mr. Humeston's testimony about his Vioxx use was implausible.Mr. Humeston had chronic pain in his left knee because of an injury he suffered in the Vietnam War and he took many different pain medications. In May 2001 almost four months before his heart attack he filled a 30-pill prescription for Vioxx; in July he filled a 20-pill prescription and received 6 sample pills from his doctor's office. Mr. Humeston had his heart attack on Sept. 18 2001 well after he would have run out of Vioxx if he had used his prescriptions as soon as he filled them.In his testimony Mr. Humeston told jurors that he had indeed taken Vioxx in the days leading up to his heart attack. He said he took only two Vioxx doses in May before deciding that the drug did not work and saving the other pills. He then used both the May and July prescriptions after filling the July prescription he said.Ms. Sullivan said she found that explanation implausible. "Why do you get a new prescription of something you know doesn't work for you?" she said to the jury.She also noted that an investigator for the post office had secretly videotaped Mr. Humeston in July 2001 to find out whether his knee injury had disabled him as much as he contended. On Sept. 17 2001 a day before Mr. Humeston's heart attack the inspector told Mr. Humeston's doctor that he believed Mr. Humeston could do additional work at the post office."Mr. Humeston's stress added up to a heart attack" Ms. Sullivan asserted.After a break for lunch Ms. Sullivan closed her argument by discussing several animal and clinical trials of Vioxx which she said proved that Merck had not tried to hide the drug's heart risks. She ended on a more informal note asking the jury not to punish Merck because it works to improve health and cure disease.That drew a rebuke from Judge Higbee who has clashed with Ms. Sullivan throughout the trial. After dismissing the jury Judge Higbee told Ms. Sullivan that her appeal was inappropriate."For some reason" the judge said "you just don't see where the line is."
0,Since the advent of the modern primary system in the 1970s New York Republicans have largely avoided the fractious intraparty battles that have divided their Democratic Party counterparts in election years like 1976 1980 1984 and 1992. But the party did so in part by heavily favoring establishment candidates and making it hard for challengers to get on the ballot. In 1996 and 2000 the New York Republican leadership’s efforts to block party insurgents made its arcane rules the focus of national attention — and embarrassment.This year the state’s entire Republican establishment — including the state party’s chairman Joseph N. Mondello; its elected official State Senator Joseph L. Bruno; and its best-known political figure Rudolph W. Giuliani — have all lined up behind Senator John McCain of Arizona. But remarkably it was Mr. McCain who in 2000 waged a highly publicized legal battle against the New York Republican party that ultimately prompted an overhaul of ballot access rules and the creation of a winner-take-all delegate-allocation system like California’s.Under the old ballot-access requirements which were considered to be the most daunting in the nation presidential candidates were required to collect 1250 signatures or 5 percent of the registered Republicans in each of the state’s Congressional districts whichever number was smaller. (New York had 31 Congressional districts in 1996 and 2000 but now has only 29.) A minimum of 5000 signatures had to be gathered statewide. In a time-honored ritual front-runners would challenge their rivals over technicalities like misspelled names. To be safe election lawyers urged candidates to get at least twice the number of required signatures in order to withstand legal challenges.In January 1996 lawyers for Bob Dole the front-runner in the Republican race to challenge President Bill Clinton went to court in Brooklyn alleging that Steve Forbes the senator’s most serious challenger in the state had engaged in widespread fraud in his attempt to be placed on the March primary ballot. The Dole campaign challenged the petitions submitted in each of the 11 Congressional districts in New York City.Mr. Forbes and another candidate Patrick J. Buchanan had fought to get on the ballot in many parts of the state and Mr. Forbes whose net worth is in the hundreds of millions of dollars was not going to give up easily. He went to court and in February 1996 won a unanimous appellate ruling ordering that his name be placed on the ballot in all 31 Congressional districts.Even with his name on the ballot Mr. Forbes faced daunting challenges. Under the party rules at the time primary voters did not vote directly for the candidates but rather for delegates pledged to certain candidates. Mr. Dole had the support of the state’s Republican establishment — including Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki — and his delegate candidates were well-known local figures. Mr. Forbes’s delegates were people most voters had never heard of.In the end such advantages worked to the benefit of Mr. Dole who won the March 7 1996 primary overwhelmingly capturing 92 of the 93 delegates at stake. Mr. Forbes won only one delegate despite having spent more than $2 million on the primary and Mr. Buchanan won no delegates.Following the problems in 1996 Mr. Pataki a Republican pushed through changes that reduced some technical requirements and lowered the number of signatures necessary to qualify for the Republican presidential primary ballot in each district. But the changes did not far enough to avoid a similar and even more high-profile problem over ballot access in 2000.Going into the 2000 primary the Republican establishment quickly rallied around a front-runner Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. As a result three underdog candidates — Gary L. Bauer Senator Orrin G. Hatch and Alan Keyes — announced plans to skip New York’s primary. Senator McCain’s campaign faced the daunting prospect of trying to get on the ballot in all 31 Congressional districts.“There is no reason why New York law should be so difficult” Guy V. Molinari who was the Staten Island borough president and heading the McCain campaign in the state said at the time.In December 1999 Mr. McCain announced that he would file a federal lawsuit to allow all widely recognized candidates onto the primary ballot. He called on Mr. Bush Governor Pataki and the state party to abandon the onerous rules arguing that no other state made it so difficult for presidential candidates to enter primaries.By the following month January 2000 even before the lawsuit had been heard the McCain campaign had managed to secure spots on the ballot in 25 of the 31 Congressional districts. The Bush campaign signaled that it planned to start challenging Mr. McCain’s nominating petitions. Mr. McCain called on Mr. Bush to stop the effort comparing it to Communist repression.Then the Republican State Committee announced that it would seek to disqualify Mr. McCain from the primary ballot in roughly half the state.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani who had already endorsed Mr. Bush came to Mr. McCain’s defense. “The primaries should be open whether you like the people who are going to be in it or not” he told reporters at City Hall.As the issue threatened to become a national embarrassment for the Republicans the Democrats saw a political opportunity and weighed in aiding Mr. McCain’s efforts to get on the ballot.The federal judge hearing Mr. McCain’s lawsuit declared at a hearing “Everything tells us that the reason for all the rules is to advantage the chosen candidate of the Republican Party.” Then the judge forced the party on Long Island to drop its attempt to toss Mr. Forbes from the ballot.Worried that their hard-charging tactics had backfired the Republican leaders signaled that they would abandon their legal battle with Mr. McCain. Then an embarrassing situation nearly turned into a farce: party officials admitted that petitions for Mr. Bush had been fraudulently assembled in a Congressional district in the South Bronx and a state judge removed Mr. Bush from the primary ballot in the district.Governor Pataki alarmed about the political costs the battle had exacted finally gave in announcing that the party would ensure that Mr. McCain was on the ballot statewide. Days later the federal judge hearing Mr. McCain’s lawsuit ruled that two of the party’s requirements for circulating nominating petitions were unconstitutional and ordered Mr. McCain and Mr. Keyes placed on the ballot.By late February with Republicans facing the first contested statewide primary in New York in 20 years Mr. Bush held a slim but steady lead over Mr. McCain. In the March 7 primary Mr. Bush’s victory was even more decisive. He captured 67 of the 93 delegates with 26 delegates for Mr. McCain and none for Mr. Keyes.After the primary Mr. Pataki who had a great deal invested in Mr. Bush’s victory urged a revision of the presidential primary rules to make the ballot simpler and to make it far easier for candidates to enter contests.Mr. Pataki’s proposal also made New York’s primary a winner-take-all contest like California’s an idea that the State Senate majority leader Mr. Bruno opposed. Mr. Bruno eventually gave in and the State Senate passed the proposal in April 2000 — although as Richard Pérez-Peña noted at the time many ballot obstacles remain for office-seekers in New York.This is part of a series looking back at pivotal New York primaries.

9,Last year when Joel Robuchon said he would retire at 50 the food world wondered whether it was just an idle threat. But if he did go through with the move and walk away from a Michelin three-star career who could possibly succeed him at the restaurant that bears his name in the hotel Le Parc in Paris?Now the foo' world has its answers. Mr. Robuchon announced last week that he would retire from the restaurant on July 5 at 51 and that on Aug. 12 Alain Ducasse the Michelin three-star chef of Le Louis XV in Monte Carlo Monaco would take over. Th' restaurant will be renamed Alain Ducasse.Mr. Ducasse 39 will not have a minute to spare. He will remain as the chef of Le Louis XV and will be the first chef to try to juggle two three-star dining rooms. He says he likes a challenge."It will only be a problem two days a week and 40 weeks a year" he said.Only?Mr. Ducasse explained that the Paris restaurant is closed on Saturdays and Sundays while Le Louis XV is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. And each closes for six weeks during different seasons. "It only takes an hour to fly from one to the other" he added. "And missing a day or so a week in each restaurant is not much. Think of the time most chefs are not in the kitchen."

6,BERLIN July 31 — Premier Khrushchev may be ready to offer a slight modification of the Soviet stand on Berlin as a goodwill gesture to pave the way for a meeting with Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of West Germany informed sources said today.The move would involve acceptance by the Soviet Union of the inclusion of West Berlin in a new trade agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union. This would amount to a tacit recognition of Bonn's formal economic ties with West Berlin.The sources recalled however that the Soviet leader was reported to have reassured Welter Ulbricht Communist chief of East Germany in Warsaw last week that the Soviet Union did not contemplate any other changes on Germany and the country's reunification.Above all Mr. Khrushchev was said to have stressed his determination to maintain the Russian stand of two separate Germanys that must come to terms with each other in direct negotiations. The West has repeatedly rejected such suggestions as unworkable.

8,The United States Steel Corporation said it had sold an 81 percent interest in its 64-story headquarters building here for $200 million and expects to sell the remaining interest by December. The purchaser was the California Public Employees Retirees System.David M. Roderick U.S. Steel's chairman said the building would remain the United States Steel Building and the company would continue to maintain its world headquarters here.The sale was seen as a move by the No.1 steelmaker to generate cash to pay for its $6.2 billion acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company. U.S. Steel had announced in July that it planned to raise $500 million to $750 million this year and a similar amount next year through the sale of assets.

0,Other questions have been raised perhaps most significantly in an investigative series titled ''Digging Deeper'' in The Oregonian the state's largest newspaper.The newspaper reported that federal studies had erred in concluding that the project would be a net gain for taxpayers. Proponents vigorously dispute the newspaper's finding.The Army Corps of Engineers issued a study in 1999 estimating that the project would produce about $2.10 in economic benefits for every $1 it cost. But the newspaper said its analysis suggested it would return only about 88 cents on the dollar.The corps says it has been updating its analysis. The results have not been released but Col. Randall J. Butler the Portland district engineer for the agency said the benefits of deepening still outweighed the costs.The plan has the support of legislatures in Oregon and Washington the states along the parts of the river that would be affected. Each has agreed to contribute $27.7 million to the project while the federal government would pay the rest. Some smaller port cities along the river also favor the deepening.The river is routinely dredged to maintain its depth and the navigation channel which runs a little more than 100 miles from Portland to the Pacific has been deepened several times in the last century -- to 25 feet then 30 then 35 and finally to the current depth of 40 feet.Each time the argument was that deepening would allow bigger ships to come to port and shipping did increase. The same reasoning is being used today though with a twist: in many cases the issue is not so much the size of the cargo ships. It is that those ships cannot be fully loaded because their draft -- how much of a ship falls below the water line -- would be too deep for the channel.

8,FOR better and for worse Abbey Simon has remained throughout his long career just on the edge of the artistic spotlight maintaining on the basis of reliable readings of the standard piano repertory a reputation unaffected by shifting musical tastes. Mr. Simon plays in a fluid polished self-effacing way and his performances can be counted on to provide at least reasonable satisfaction and pleasure. They fall into no particular interpretative camp but pursue their own sensible straightforward path.If this sounds like tepid praise it is not intended that way although Mr. Simon occasionally plays in a manner that leaves a listener puzzled and disappointed. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debut the pianist returned there on Sunday evening and presented a program of works by Beethoven Mendelssohn Chopin Rachmaninoff and Ravel -bringing to them all nothing less than the note-perfect intelligently crafted interpretations for which he is known yet investing none of them with the sort of individualistic twist that would transform his performances into distinctive memorable experiences.To his considerable credit Mr. Simon conceives works in large sweeping arches never allowing himself to become bogged down by the small fussy inflections that might disrupt the flow of the music. In Mendelssohn's ''Song Without Words'' in C (Op. 67 No. 4) and in the final movement of Beethoven Sonata in G (Op. 14 No. 2) the pianist paddled smoothly through the streams of fast swirling notes. He glided across the pristine surfaces of Ravel's eerie ''Oiseaux tristes'' and mastered the formidable intricacies and Spanish rhythms of the composer's ''Alborada del gracioso.''Elsewhere however his playing sounded almost frustratingly benign with the ordinarily disputatious Chopin B-flat minor Sonata - a score full of conflicted emotions - passing under Mr. Simon's hands without raising much of a fuss at all.

7,Creation of the egg board follows by three months a ruling by a Federal Trade Commission judge that the egg industry had engaged in deceptive advertising by contending that the possibility of a heart attack is not increased by eating eggs.“There exists a substantial body of competent and reliable scientific evidence that eating eggs increases the risks of heart attack or heart disease” the judge said in his ruling against the National Commission on Egg Nutrition. Hendrik Wentink chairman of the egg commission called the decision an “unprecedented intrusion upon our right of free speech.”One of the reasons the egg board is being established said an Agriculture Department spokesman is that “they want to get this research program going on the cholesterol business.” He added that a “lot of money” raised for the board will probably go for studies on the cholesterol level in eggs and its relation to heart disease.However the spokesman added that the major objective of the board will be to reverse declining egg consumption in the country. A poultry official at the Department of Agriculture said the egg board would not adopt a U.S.D.A. label in its advertising.Prompted by an article in the Merchandising Magazine a few months ago proclaiming that was sale of Diet products was near the $90 million sales mark in chain drug stores and that the peak sale periods were durinf the spring months—when visions of bathing suits nag almost everyone—the consumer affairs committee of Americans for Democratic Action has countered with a new report attacking the usefulness of diet aids.

9,Roni Horn Mary Boone Gallery 417 West Broadway (near Spring Street) SoHo Through Oct. 30"When Dickinson Shut Her Eyes" is the title of Roni Horn's bare-bones sculpture installation and the poems of Emily Dickinson are its subject. The work consists of dozens of square aluminum rods each of which is a yard or two long and carries a line of verse in inlayed black plastic letters. Propped up against the gallery wall the rods are gathered into clusters that make up complete poems.The poems Ms. Horn has chosen are not among those often anthologized and she seems to want to compound their unfamiliarity by making them difficult to read. In some lines the letters are printed in mirror image and the verse-bearing sides of the rods are consistently turned in different directions preventing a direct face-forward attention to the flow of the words.One appreciates Ms. Horn's attempt to slow down consideration of Dickinson's work. But to reduce the poems to a game of hide-and-seek is surely the last thing Dickinson who so exquisitely paced her linguistic surprises would have wanted. In the end the chief accomplishment of Ms. Horn's installation is to send one to the bookshelf to consult the matchless originals firsthand. HOLLAND COTTER

0,Bookstores new and used abound -- including one of Northern California's great independent bookstores and a local cultural landmark Book Shop Santa Cruz. Such literary demand hints at another less obvious Santa Cruz identity -- as a true university town. The population of about 55000 includes some 11000 students who attend the University of California Santa Cruz known as the most offbeat of the U.C. branches (their mascot is the banana slug).One afternoon we stationed ourselves at the Chocolate Bistro a sidewalk cafe near the entrance to Book Shop Santa Cruz and took in the parade of hippies yuppies punks students street musicians Hare Krishnas and police officers in shorts riding their mountain bikes. There always seemed to be at least one person playing the drums. (Now though there is a proposed city ordinance that if passed will make panhandling all but impossible after mid-October.)The scene was lively too for Sunday brunch at Zachary's deservedly the most popular breakfast spot for dishes like sourdough pancakes. Our first night we lucked out with a last-minute dinner reservation at Oswald -- a snug bistro recommended by every local resident we asked. The food was heavenly -- from a silky squid-ink risotto topped with Monterey Bay calamari to a dark chocolate soufflé served with a tiny pitcher of heavy cream -- but the ambience was casual right down to our blond surfer waiter.Surfers and their culture are ubiquitous. One of their landmarks is O'Neill's the Pacific Avenue shop owned by Jack O'Neill a 40-year resident who invented the surfing wet suit (no doubt inspired by the chilly Northern California waters). Outside old VW vans with surfboards strapped to the roofs ride Pacific Avenue straight down to the beach.One of the world's great surfing breaks Steamer Lane is off the sandstone cliffs of Lighthouse Point about a mile and a half up the coast from the Boardwalk. Unlike many such breaks it's easily seen from the coast as is Seal Rock a tiny island strewn with glossy black sea lions and harbor seals.The Point's little brick lighthouse has been converted into the Surfing Museum a snug space crammed with displays detailing surfing moves like aerials and floaters and the exploits of the two Hawaiian princes who introduced surfing to Santa Cruz in 1885. An enormous 10-foot redwood longboard from the 1930's vies for attention with a modern polyurethane board riddled with shark bites.But we soon joined the crowd that had gathered transfixed around a television set playing the 2001 surfing documentary ''Whipped!'' It includes stunning footage of a season at Mavericks the legendary big wave break point 60 miles up the coast and a mile from land. Surfers there ride -- and risk getting crushed by -- waves as high as 80 feet.

1,PhotoSeason 3 Episode 10: ‘Stingers’Intro Товарищи у вас есть дети?(Comrades do you have kids?)At last the moment we have been waiting for all season. An irresistible challenge is lobbed across the Jennings’s kitchen island and their response is unexpected and unrehearsed.Paige seizes the opportunity and throws her parents off-balance. “Do you love me? Then tell me the truth.” She pours out her years of uncertainty and fear and confusion: “What — are you in the witness protection program? Did you kill somebody? Are you guys drug dealers like your friend Gregory? Am I adopted? Are we aliens? What?”Philip and Elizabeth have no choice but to answer truthfully.Once the words are spoken gently circuitously padded with euphemism and shorn of detail Philip and Elizabeth become the hunted vulnerable at every turn to the whims of their idealistic 15-year-old daughter and by extension her now-even-more-sinister mentor Pastor Tim (who shows off yet another hairstyle). No wonder he wants to lure the whole family to Kenya for a mission project. He’s got their whole world in his hands.The moment brings Philip and Elizabeth together. For once when he asks if she’s O.K. the woman who has survived rape and beatings and bullets — and who has killed casually and repeatedly — says quaveringly that she doesn’t know.Although Elizabeth and Philip warn Paige (“If you do tell anyone we will go to jail for good.”) they are reluctant to leave her at home the next morning. In the car Elizabeth’s eyes fill with tears but it’s not clear whether they are tears of compassion or fear or anger. Philip tries to be reassuring. “She won’t do anything stupid” he says even as Paige is calling Pastor Tim. On the phone she tells him that she asked her parents the questions just the way he had coached her to — then she stopped short of giving him the answer.Now Philip and Elizabeth may never be as sure as they were before. Control has probably been an illusion for them all along. As Gabriel says about another matter “It’s not up to us.” It never is.This week the focus of “The Americans” is almost purely domestic save for some international window-dressing in service of episodes to come. While last week’s show was an impossible act to follow this episode changes the future.A plague of bugs.Stan has an awkward moment of awakening as the investigator Walter Taffet questions him about who might have planted the bug in Agent Gaad’s pen. Moments later he is back in his department asking after Martha.Kimmy meanwhile reappears as a damsel in distress stranded at a frat party. Once again she is a conveniently sleepy drunk giving Philip a chance to swap out the tape secreted in her father’s briefcase while avoiding the dreaded seduction scene. “You know I think you’re the only one who really cares about me” she tells him drowsily.Stan comes over the gift of a confiscated pirated videotape in hand. It’s “Tron” for Henry. Is that all it is? Wouldn’t that be the perfect vehicle for a listening device? Or perhaps the conversation was simply an innocent meeting of the hearts of two guys with a similar outlook on life and the same taste in women. Whatever the reason it doesn’t take Henry long to show up at Stan’s door for a game of Strat-O-Matic which allows us to see not only their developing friendship but also the heaps of great ’80s period props that litter Stan’s house right down to the harvest gold hand mixer and smiley face cookie jar. Henry is a welcome guest as Stan prepares to divvy up the material effects of his marriage to Sandra (a signal that we’ll see her again?).Of course Stan might not have had spying in mind when he brought the tape over. Pastor Tim though could have been carrying a small easy-to-install listening device that he surreptitiously left in the travel agency when he popped in ostensibly to talk about arranging a mission trip. He also gave Philip some unsolicited advice about child-rearing suggesting that Paige be treated more like an adult than a child. He should be more careful.As we count reluctantly down to the end of the season anything seems possible.Where is thy sting?This week brings another barbed title: “Stingers” the defensive mechanism of insects; the quivering killer tip of the scorpion’s curved tail; and the name give to the shoulder-mounted missile that the United States supplied to mujahedeen fighters in Afghanistan and which was credited with helping to turn the tide of the Afghan war with the Soviets.The tape from Kimmy’s reveals something is coming. The Pakistani intelligence agency I.S.I. is sending a representative of the mujahedeen to talk to the C.I.A. it seems based on the snippets of tape we hear presumably of agents discussing the covert operation.With some elisions and no clear idea of who was saying what:“What happened to Hilton?”“It didn’t get approved.”“They’re going to stay at the Clayton in Crystal City. These guys won’t know the difference; they’re used to sleeping in caves.”Their main concern it seemed was to keep the United States Army out of the picture until the last possible moment.“The Army isn’t on the ground in Afghanistan so basically it’s not their war” one voice says.“Well if this works we aren’t going to need them” says another.And so Philip and Elizabeth are off to the Clayton in this week’s wigs to lay the groundwork so to speak.Just when you thought it was safe to go to the ladies’ room again.That wasn’t a piece of gum Zinaida stuck under the sink at the multiplex where she and her coterie of agents were seeing “Tootsie.” Did Stan take her out to set her up with an opportunity to use the ladies’ room again as part of his plot with Oleg? Zinaida does make a queenly request to use the restroom and after Stan checks it she hands him her Kit Kats (is she unfaithful to Milky Ways or just trying something exotic for one night?) with aplomb.At the Rezidentura enter the newish agent Tatiana interrupting a meeting between Arkady and Oleg. Last time she seemed almost flirtatious with Oleg. Now looking ever so secretive and making exaggerated spy-like moves that border on mime she shoos him away. She is bearing a coded message to Arkady from the mysterious agent Willow who reports that she is being threatened by one of their own. Arkady furious chalks it up to overcompartmentalization that flawed structure of plausible deniability which every espionage organization embraces from time to time. Arkady believes in a bureaucratic solution not realizing that the problem is a local one. Could he possibly imagine Oleg in his bad-guy outfit sitting smugly in Zinaida’s darkened hotel room?Far from the tree.A nice shot of Henry’s hiding place echoes familiar shots of his father and Henry has loosened a floorboard for his strongbox full of junior “porn” in the finest K.G.B. tradition. One moment of humiliation by Paige and Henry goes underground. (At least it looks like he made the hole in the floor himself to conceal his own secrets. The moccasins in the scene do look rather large though. He wouldn’t use his father’s closet as a hiding place would he?)Henry’s impression of the classic “Saturday Night Live” skit “Mr. Robinson’s Neighborhood” was one of his longest speeches yet and it enlivened an otherwise awkward morning after the talk with Paige and gave his character a chance to say a few more words than usual if nothing else.It’s Miller Time.When Stan comes over to dine we see the scene through Paige’s eyes for a moment. Now that she has been enlightened about her parents she stares at Stan as if she had never seen an F.B.I. agent before. Philip brandishes that big kitchen knife we saw earlier in the season and then like a TV chef scrapes one knife against another. It goes on just a beat longer than it needs to as if to emphasize the message.Comments on the comments.Nancy Duggan of Morristown N.J. you are right about the pronunciation “male robot.” Martha especially described it that way. I think the writers and actors were having a bit of fun with us. Does anyone see anything deeper there?Lois Smith does indeed have a stunning résumé and some of the clips of her in her youth were quite arresting. Thanks to commenters I went hunting and loved this sample from the screen test with James Dean. The Elizabeth/Betty observations by all of you are astute and add dimension to an already powerful scene. Will we see Betty again in a flashback or in the event that she did leave a note? We certainly won’t forget her.And thanks for all the interpretive assistance regarding “Blade Runner” and “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?”Товарищи помните: Говорите по-русски.(Comrades remember: Speak Russian.)

9,Publishers are well aware that even a best seller can turn into a financial dud with an overpaid author and a big print run. Over the last five years print runs for best-seller candidates have been inflated from an average minimum of 50000 copies to at least 100000 and the shelf life of some other books has been compressed from four months to as little as four weeks.''At times it's like a big pyramid scheme where we keep shipping out the books and trying to hide the fact that there's a lot of dead titles'' said Irwyn Applebaum the president of Bantam Doubleday Dell which is owned by Bertelsmann A.G. ''Everybody is on such overdrive to make do and grow and expand that they don't stop and study this. I think that an adjustment is going to have to come. But it's a lot like nuclear disarmament. Just because you reduce your books doesn't mean that the other publishers are going to reduce their copies.''Returns are the most significant barometer of the financial success of a book a measurement more critical than a ranking on a best-seller list because rejects cut directly into profits. Historically publishers have agreed to take back returns and absorb the loss to entice bookstores to stock their titles.Many of the major publishing houses report that their companies have managed to escape the phenomenon relatively unscathed with returns -- as a percentage of gross sales -- that are either flat declining or slightly above average.However figures from their own trade group the American Association of Publishers indicate that in the last five years the losses from returns have expanded far faster than gross sales which are essentially the books that are shipped to bookstores. From 1990 to 1995 the industry's losses for rejected hardback books increased by 60 percent to $531 million while gross sales increased by 47 percent to $1.64 billion.Although the figures show that more money is coming in the system leaves publishers at increased risk. More books are being shipped out according to publishers and more books are being returned. They are coming back in such consistent rapid cycles that it has given rise to a debate about the efficiency of the industry.At Random House Mr. Vitale would say only that ''returns are higher than we would like them'' although the gossipy industry is rife with talk about books coming back to the publisher by the truckload.
9,Mr. Clinton said that the food stamp cuts and the restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants had ''nothing to do with welfare reform'' and were simply intended to help balance the Federal budget. Republicans said that these provisions accounted for 75 percent of the $55 billion in savings projected under the bill in the next six years.Mr. Clinton's likely opponent in this year's Presidential race Bob Dole commended Mr. Clinton for ''finally climbing on board the Dole welfare reform proposal'' but said the President had ''stymied every attempt to pass meaningful welfare reform'' until now. Mr. Dole has repeatedly denounced Mr. Clinton's earlier vetoes saying they showed that he had abandoned his 1992 campaign promise to ''end welfare as we know it.''Welfare has been a major issue in this year's Presidential campaign and Republicans were ready to pounce on the President if he vetoed the new welfare bill.Haley Barbour chairman of the Republican National Committee said today ''Welfare reform would never have happened without the Republican Congress.'' Mr. Barbour asserted that the President had been forced to sign the bill ''rather than risk his re-election.''Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York who has studied welfare policy for decades and led opposition to the bill said: ''The President has made his decision. Let us hope that it is for the best.'' In an interview just before the President spoke Mr. Moynihan said: ''The Cabinet is against the bill. The pollsters are for it. This is a defining event in his Presidency.''Among the Democrats dismayed by Mr. Clinton's decision was Representative John Lewis of Georgia. Just before the House approved the bill Mr. Lewis addressed the chamber in anguished tones. ''Where is the compassion?'' he asked. ''Where is the sense of decency? Where is the heart of this Congress? This bill is mean. It is base. It is downright lowdown. What does it profit a great nation to conquer the world only to lose its soul?''But Representative John R. Kasich the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee summarized the case for the bill this way: ''People are not entitled to anything but opportunity. You can't be on welfare for generations.''
0,Today is the start of World Breastfeeding Week and partly to mark the occasion about 30 women nursing infants rode the A train from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia in Washington Heights to Nostrand Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn. There they exited the subway and joined a rally at Restoration Plaza.But the women were not taking part in the annual subway ride held since 2004 merely to demonstrate their right to breastfeed in public. (Since 1994 it has been legal for women to breastfeed anywhere in public — “irrespective of whether or not the nipple of the mother’s breast is covered during or incidental to the breastfeeding” — under the state’s Civil Rights Law.)The women were advocating for the Breastfeeding Bill of Rights a legislative proposal that has passed the Assembly in Albany but has stalled in the State Senate in part because of concerns raised by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.The law would affirm that pregnant women have the right to information about the “nutritional medical and psychological benefits of breastfeeding”; the right to stay with their babies immediately and continuously after delivery “to facilitate beginning breastfeeding immediately”; the right to refuse bottle feeding for their newborns in hospitals or other health care facilities; the right to be informed about and refuse any drugs that may dry up breast milk; and the right to “refuse any gifts or take-home packets distributed by the maternal health care facility that contain commercial advertising or product samples.” (There has already been a strong push to eliminate baby formula samples from hospital gift bags.)Most of the legislation affirms what is already on the books in state laws or regulations but the bill’s sponsor State Senator Liz Krueger a Manhattan Democrat said the proposal “codifies mothers’ rights to breastfeed into a single concise document and bans commercial interests from influencing new mothers’ choice of breastfeeding.”Ms. Krueger criticized a fellow state senator Kemp Hannon Republican of Long Island saying he “has kept the Breastfeeding Bill of Rights bottled up in committee for too long” and noting that the Assembly has twice passed the bill the last time unanimously.In a phone interview Mr. Hannon said he was not opposed in principle to the legislation but was sensitive to concerns raised by obstetricians and gynecologists about the wording of the proposal. Some of the language concerning access to information he said could be read to mean “interference in the practice of medicine.”Senators Krueger and Hannon both said that the bill’s supporters had tried to address the doctors’ concerns. Ms. Krueger gave him stacks of paper toward the recent end of the legislative session Mr. Hannon said documenting how the bill mostly enshrined provisions already contained in state laws or regulations.“It’s a fine idea but the implementation is something you have to be very cautious about” Mr. Hannon said. “You can’t practice medicine by legislative enactment.”He added that he would be willing to have the Standing Committee on Health which he leads take a look at the bill if the doctors’ concerns are addressed. “The goal is quite laudatory” he said while adding “I think we should leave the practice of medicine to people who are licensed to do that.”Ms. Krueger said the bill represents a consensus among health care providers nutritionists lactation specialists and others involved in the issue including the New York City Breastfeeding Promotion Leadership Committee a working group that includes government agencies nonprofit groups and health care providers.The committee includes groups like the Black Women’s Breastfeeding Alliance the Bronx Breastfeeding Committee and La Leche League International which focus on black and Hispanic women.Traditionally white women and middle-class and affluent women have been far more likely to breastfeed than minority women and women from working-class or poor backgrounds. Many working women find breastfeeding to be too time-consuming or complicated.The dispute appears so far to be one of language and not ideology.The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends breastfeeding an infant through the first year and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports has endorsed breastfeeding because it reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancers adult-onset diabetes and osteoporosis.Studies suggest that more than two-thirds of mothers breastfeed after being discharged from the hospital but the proportion drops dramatically after six months. Hospital-based programs that encourage breastfeeding have been shown to result in women breastfeeding for longer periods.

9,At last Thursday's performance of the Missa Solemnis at Avery Fisher Hall Kurt Masur had all the virtuosity he needed. The New York Philharmonic gleamed; the New York Choral Artists and the American Boychoir knocked down one scary passage after another. It was very impressive and almost too easy. This is not easy music.Why did Beethoven make things so hard for the rest of us? Mozart and Liszt wrote music that likes to be played though both are difficult in their separate ways. One explanation says that Beethoven was mad (which he must have been). Another is that he didn't care (he said as much famously to a complaining violinist about another piece): Beethoven wanted an effect and it was up to the performer to realize it.Another answer is that deafness had so isolated him from the tactile and practical world of performing that the concerns of the musician became remote from his thoughts. Composers in fact often hear their music faster than performers do probably because for them the connection of thought to sound is direct without the middlemen that the listener requires: no violins to scrape pianos to pound or high notes to attack. A machine on the drawing board runs unimpeded. In motion friction comes into play. It slows things down.This might be why the metronome speeds that Beethoven later attached to his pieces seem fast to us so fast that the composer's metronome has been accused of malfunction. Or are these tempos what he really wanted? The better we get at playing the string quartets for example the more quartet players argue for the latter but we won't ever really know.The more paranoid among us say that Beethoven knew precisely what he was doing and that fear and physical strain were calculated parts of the musical message. It happens elsewhere in his later music one example being the finale of the ''Hammerklavier'' Piano Sonata written five years earlier than the Missa Solemnis. So great is the effort to negotiate this monster of a movement that palpable effort even among well-developed piano virtuosos becomes part of the musical experience.
9,With Blue Cross plans all over the country in financial trouble Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey is fighting to regain the financial health it enjoyed until the 1980's when changes in the state's system of paying for health care combined with an explosion in expensive medical technology threatened to bankrupt the insurer.New Jersey Blue Cross officials said they are concentrating on new strategies. They said they are devising programs to steer their policyholders to hospitals offering the best rates as well as the best care and they said they also will campaign to force commercial insurance companies to help underwrite the cost of insuring people with the poorest health.The nonprofit corporation which until 1980 was given a 30 percent discount by hospitals because of its quasi-public role as the insurer of last resort lost most of its competitive edge in the last decade and has been accused by public health advocates of trying to abandon its commitment to insure all comers.The financial problems plaguing New Jersey Blue Cross may exemplify the difficulties facing other plans. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Senator Sam Nunn a Georgia Democrat is looking into the financial strength of the nation's 73 Blue Cross companies. Mr. Nunn estimates that 20 percent of the insurance companies have financial problems.

1,You might be wondering how Seattle fans are feeling about their Seahawks. It turns out that many are about as excited as most N.F.L. fans about the prospect of a losing team making the playoffs.Danny O’Neil The Seattle Times:It’s fair for you to wonder whether an NFL team that has lost all nine games by 15 or more points has any business saying “postseason” let alone playing in it. So it’s understandable that most of you who responded to a poll on The Seattle Times’ website Sunday and Monday said you’d prefer Seattle lose the regular-season finale to St. Louis. But to hope for the team to lose? Really? You want the Seahawks’ division rival to come to Qwest Field and clinch that franchise’s first playoff berth in six years?Seattle could lose 10 spots in the draft by winning and some Seahawks fans would like to draft Jake Locker the hugely popular quarterback from Washington.In an earlier column O’Neil wrote that reseeding and other playoff formulas would not necessarily make things better:For better or worse the NFL decided that divisions mean something. That’s why schedules are weighted teams playing every team in their division twice. If the NFL doesn’t want to emphasize division champions in the playoff seeding it shouldn’t emphasize division play in the schedule. So make your jokes about the NFC West. It’s a deservingly awful target. Just don’t fool yourself that there’s a simple fix for playoff formats.Extra point: Maybe there is no simple fix. But surely there has to be a better way. The Giants who crushed the Seahawks in Seattle earlier this season could miss out on the playoffs with a 10-6 record. If the Seahawks beat the Rams on Sunday night they will be in at 7-9.

1,INDIANAPOLIS — If Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski can’t play in Super Bowl XLVI because of a high ankle sprain there might not be anyone to fill his shoes.It feels like tempting fate for the Patriots who streamrolled the league with their dual threats — Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez — but they have no other tight ends on the active roster. Carson Butler has been stashed on the practice squad for 16 months.The New England tight ends coach Brian Ferentz agrees that it is an odd situation.“You are living a little dangerously at times when most of our offense is geared toward having two tight ends out there” Ferentz said. “My argument is that the offense never changes just the people who are in there.”But the Patriots haven’t been satisfied with most of their other options waiving tight ends Will Yeatman and Dan Gronkowski and offensive tackle Thomas Welch who lined up as an eligible receiver at times. Those duties have been handed to the rookie offensive tackle Nate Solder who started at tight end for two seasons with the University of Colorado.“I’ve been flexible” said Solder who is primarily a blocker when he serves as the third tight end. “I’ve been playing all sorts of different positions and I just go in wherever they need me.”He may have to go in often Sunday although Hernandez doesn’t seem too worried about Gronkowski who has not practiced this week after leading the N.F.L. with 17 receiving touchdowns.“Everybody needs to step up if Rob isn’t 100 percent because he draws so much attention and is such a threat on the field” Hernandez said. “I think he’ll play. I think he’ll be a big impact in this game.”And on the other sideline? The Giants have kept three tight ends — Jake Ballard Bear Pascoe and Travis Beckum — on their active roster all season despite relying on their wide receivers for the downfield passing game.

0,CVS and Caremark Rx said Wednesday afternoon that they agreed to combine in what they described as a “merger of equals” creating a company with about $75 billion in annual revenue. As is typical in such deals though one company emerged as the de facto buyer: CVS’s shareholders would end up owning a slight majority — 54.5 percent — of the enlarged company and Caremark shareholders would turn in their stock in exchange for CVS shares the companies said.The announcement came a few hours after CVS a drug-store chain and Caremark a pharmacy benefits manager confirmed a report in The New York Times that they were in talks about a possible transaction.In Wednesday’s deal each Caremark share would be exchanged for 1.67 shares of CVS the companies said in a press release. The combined company would be called CVS/Caremark and have its headquarters in Woonsocket R.I. where CVS is based.The exchange ratio seemed to take the markets by surprise as shares of Caremark which had been trading higher earlier in the day fell sharply after the deal terms were announced. Caremark’s stock was down 2.7 percent in late-afternoon trading.Caremark is the largest U.S. provider of pharmacy benefit management services which involves administering drug benefits for individuals on behalf of big corporations unions and other organizations.CVS has 6200 stores in the U.S. and also owns its own in-house pharmacy benefits management group.Changes in the health-care landscape have forced many consumers to take a more-active role in decisions about buying prescription drugs and CVS chief executive Tom Ryan said Wednesday that combining with Caremark would fit well with that trend. “Together CVS and Caremark will help manage the costs and complexities of the U.S. healthcare system offering unparalleled access and driving superior healthcare outcomes enhancing value for employers health plans and consumers” he said in a press release.As Reuters pointed out benefits managers such as Caremark have also posed a threat to brick-and-mortar pharmacies by mailing prescription drugs directly to consumers. For CVS then the Caremark deal would be a way to buy the competition.Caremark’s financial advisers on the transaction were J.P. Morgan Chase and UBS; King & Spalding and Jones Day gave legal advice. CVS was advised by Evercore Group and Lehman Brothers as well as law firms Davis Polk & Wardwell and Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo.Go to Press Release from BusinessWire via Yahoo News »Go to Article from Reuters »Go to Related Article from The New York Times »

0,Europe's biggest tire maker Michelin warned that operating income this year would be 6.2 percent to 6.8 percent of revenue down from an initial forecast of 7.7 percent to 8.3 percent because of the slowdown in the United States a weak global market for truck tires and the high cost of rubber which is priced in dollars. Michelin said first-half operating income dropped 9 percent to 491 million euros ($430 million) from 540 million euros last year on a 4.5 percent increase in revenue to 7.7 billion ($6.7 billion) from 7.4 billion euros. Michel Rollier Michelin's chief financial officer said the company could not rule out that those difficulties would not spill into 2002. One bright spot appeared to be the sale of 4 million tires to Ford to help replace 13 million Firestone tires Ford considers potentially hazardous. John Tagliabue (NYT)

8,NO sooner is Willie Nelson released from jail after serving 20 years for trying to rob a train than he gets together that old gang of his and goes off to try to rob a train again. He knows that an ex-Texas Ranger Richard Widmark who stopped him the first time will be out to get him again with that old gang of his.Old is the key word in ''Once Upon a Texas Train'' the two-hour television movie on Channel 2 at 9 P.M. Sunday. Some of the robbers and lawmen hauled out of retirement have trouble shooting in the right direction staying in the saddle and telling a horse from a bicycle.The notion of a tale about aging cowboys is not exactly original but this easygoing effort written produced and directed by Burt Kennedy ambles amiably along as the pals regroup and head toward the bend of the Rio Brazos only to discover that the river has long since dried up and the railroad tracks have been torn up. Just about then durn it the script dries up or goes off the track stranding all parties like the little engine that couldn't.Mr. Kennedy tries to keep things chugging by bringing in Angie Dickinson who won the hearts of both Mr. Widmark and Mr. Nelson when they were comrades in the Confederate Army. She looks mighty good for a gal from the Old Confederacy and smiles lovingly upon both her creaky suitors but such affairs produce no steam. Then there is a gang of young baddies who dare to confront the old baddies a prolonged encounter that makes little sense even for a television western. The chief young baddie gets to kiss a pretty miss who is brought on for no other reason than to be kissed. It is an uphill trip before the final improbable shoot-out between the generations in one of those empty towns whose only industry is shoot-outs.
0,DINNER with entertainment often used to mean dinner theater but the days of dinner theater in Connecticut seem to have faded into yesteryear along with veal cordon bleu and baked Alaska.That doesn't mean you have to dine in silence or to a repertory of golden oldies played off-key on an out-of-tune piano. These days you can find some very hot live music and entertainment all around the state in both fancy and funky settings that also feature interesting food. Here are a few of some of the livelier spots listed alphabetically by town.BridgeportDowntown Cabaret Theater may be the last outpost of what used to be known as dinner theater -- with a twist. Maybe it has survived because of its novel approach to dining called B.Y.O.D. Bring Your Own Dinner (and drinks). It works surprisingly well. Some patrons arrive with pizza and beer others favor more elaborate menus and a few have gone so far as to bring their own tablecloths china and silverware.The drill we found was to arrive early (in order to get the choice seats facing the stage at our reserved table which is shared with others) and unwrap and munch on our home-made sandwiches pasta salad and cookies. While we opted for the casual we noticed diners at another table with a large casserole salad bowl foil-wrapped warm rolls meringue pie and 1920's-style cocktail shaker of martinis. Most tables seat 8 though there are a few for 2 and one for 10 diners. Soft drinks tea and coffee are the only drinks sold on the premises.

9,Standing on a ballroom stage in Las Vegas Nev. earlier this year Herman Cain president of the National Restaurant Association sang to his members crooning in a rich baritone: ''If I can see it I can do it; if I just believe there's nothing to it.''I believe I can fly; I believe I can touch the sky!''Not surprisingly the unusual performance from the industry's top lobbyist raised a few eyebrows among the restaurateurs in the audience who were there for an association convention. But in truth Mr. Cain had reason to crow because the restaurant industry is flush.Americans are eating out more often than ever before. Average check prices are higher than they have ever been. More than 10.2 million people are employed in restaurants more than at any time in the past. And total industry sales are expected to reach a record high this year $354 billion.And yet association lobbyists managed to convince House Republicans this summer that restaurants were suffering enduring harm from the Government's decision in 1993 to reduce the tax deductibility of business meals to 50 percent from 80 percent. The House tax cut bill passed earlier this month includes a heavily lobbied provision that raises it back to 80 percent. The tax bill that passed the Senate on Friday does not contain the provision meaning more lobbying lies ahead.

0,Good news for Muslims in Malaysia at least those who are fans of the Black Eyed Peas: concert organizers said that they could attend a coming performance by the band after previously stating that the show was open only to non-Muslims Agence France-Presse reported. A Web site for the concert which is being held on Sept. 25 near Kuala Lumpur to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Guinness brewery in Dublin had said that “the party is only open to non-Muslims aged 18 years and above” and Malaysia’s Ministry of Information Communication and Culture had said that Muslims could not attend. Of Malaysia’s 25 million people 60 percent are Muslims; Islamic law forbids the consumption of alcohol. But the concert’s promoters Artists World Entertainment said in a statement that the event was now “open to all individuals aged 18 and above” according to Agence France-Presse. No immediate reason for the change was given though the original plan to bar Muslims from the show drew widespread attention and criticism.

0,So what does Tyco International look like without the accounting gimmickry? Tyco's chief executive Edward D. Breen acknowledged yesterday that it is not the fast-growth high-margin collection of assets that L. Dennis Kozlowski the former chief executive loved to compare to General Electric.Still Mr. Breen proudly proclaimed in a conference call with investors that ''we're going to grow this business back for the future'' now that Tyco has completed its internal investigation which uncovered a pattern of aggressive accounting and prompted a $382 million restatement in earnings.But the company will never be the Tyco that Mr. Kozlowski dreamed of.The new Tyco though still viable is what skeptics always thought it was: a hodgepodge of consistently profitable but unconnected slow-growth businesses that produced things as diverse as surgical gear and home-security systems. Mr. Breen's reiterated earnings forecast for 2003 of $1.50 to $1.75 a share acknowledged as much.Without a steady stream of acquisitions -- and the artificially inflated earnings boost that Tyco engineered for the first couple of quarters after each deal was completed -- the consistent growth that made Tyco a highflying stock in the last couple of years is over. And there is going to be a bumpy road ahead.

0,In a company once legendary for its "lifers" he is a new kind of middle manager. When Steinway hired him in 2000 he had no experience in woodworking but fifteen years of manufacturing everything from leather goods to lemonade. He replaced a foreman who retired after forty-one years of making rims. Gurrado who is in his early fifties and whose hair is going from black to steel gray stepped into one of the factory's toughest jobs. As a foreman he is a frontline manager. The workers have their union. Upper-level managers can insulate themselves from the day-to-day problems. The foremen cannot. The foremen are responsible when their men fall behind because someone called in sick because a machine broke down because someone misread a specification. They are responsible when they do not set an example by wearing safety glasses ("My eyelashes are too long" was the excuse of a foreman whom Steinway later fired) or when they take their men to lunch. Steinway frowns even more on foremen who take half their men to lunch (especially if they happen to return to work a few minutes late). All that upper-level managers will say about a foreman they have fired is something as vague as "It just didn't work out." A sentence like that hints at the camaraderie at the factory the closeness of the workers and the foremen and the plant managers. The foremen are the ones who must "feed the next guy" as Gurrado puts it-to provide the foreman in the next department with whatever the schedule calls for. For Gurrado that means rims ready to have their rough edges sliced off.Gurrado is eager to show how much he has absorbed as the foreman with the least time on the payroll. It is no coincidence that among the factory's twelve foremen he is the only one who regularly wears polo shirts with "Steinway & Sons" stitched above his heart. He is aware that he is probably still seen as a newcomer and may be resented for being on a fast track to some higher job. He has mastered the lingo and probably the details. If one of his men does not show up in the morning he could step in and do the job without missing a beat. His we're-in-this-together attitude conveys the pressures he feels. This may not be rocket science he seems to say but neither is it easy. There is an art to bending these rims to knowing just how much glue to spread on the wood to finding the almost imperceptible dips in the surface of the maple where an extra touch is needed to force the strips into an almost-90-degree turn at the far end.Gurrado is built like a brawler but is in fact the kind of boss who would like to be liked not the kind whose first response to a worker's foul-up is to lose his temper. He speaks Spanish passably which helps some of his men understand his commands. In English he pronounces the word "length" a staple in the vocabulary of someone whose job is to give orders for measuring and trimming without the k sound. The way he says it it rhymes with "plinth."Gurrado lives about five miles from the factory on the block on which he grew up in Sunnyside Queens a working-class neighborhood with huge rail yards that funnel commuter trains toward Manhattan. His father was a machinist with the New York City Transit Authority working on the axle-and-wheel mechanisms on subway cars. Gurrado was an assistant manager for a clothing maker in the garment district in Manhattan and then a supervisor in a sugar refinery where a powerful union had won what it considered an important concession in a round-the-clock operation: No one worked the same shift two weeks in a row. If you had day hours this week you would work the overnight shift next week and the 4 P.M.-to-midnight shift the week after. Gurrado found that the constant rotation wore him out. He also felt it lowered morale at the factory. He started casting about for another job.A headhunter he knew tipped him off that Steinway was looking for someone with supervisory experience. The headhunter figured Gurrado would jump at the short commute. "I said 'But I don't know anything about a piano. They wouldn't hire me'" Gurrado recalls. "He said 'Don't be so sure.' He had more experience in placing people and he knew that quite often they're not looking for specific knowledge in their business because they have to teach you that. They're looking for a certain background that they could utilize develop."Steinway hired him and assigned him to various supervisory projects that exposed him to the different parts of the factory. "They really didn't have any openings to run departments but they knew that in the near future they would because they had older people working there and they knew that they were going to retire" he says. After two years when the longtime foreman in rim-bending put in his papers Gurrado took over.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

By the 1980s Caribbean immigrants had begun taking the Italians' places. In the 1990s the labor pool changed again. Gurrado's crew includes three Bosnians. One of them Nazif Sutrovic was a police official in Sarajevo during the 1984 Winter Olympics. His English is balky so when he jokes that he used to put people in jail the punch line falls flat. His explanation for his trouble with English is embarrassed but impeccably worded: "I don't have time to go to school." He has another job as the superintendent of a Brooklyn apartment building. The crew chief Eric Lall who is Gurrado's No. 2 man was hired in 1992 after working as a shipping supervisor in a jewelry store. And Tommy Stavrianos-at twenty-eight the youngest man on the crew-talks proudly of the pianos he makes and of the company's traditions. But Gurrado and his men are not the concert-hall regulars that their pianos are. The radios around the factory play soft rock and jazz.* * *Gurrado's load report shows that K0862 will have what Steinway calls an ebonized finish meaning that it will be lacquered black and will look like concert grands that took shape a generation ago or before World War II or before World War I. The guts of K0862-the strings the hammers that strike them the keys to which the hammers are attached-will be made according to plans and specifications that date to the 1880s and 1890s. But is a brand-new piano ready the moment it leaves the factory?Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIn the 1920s a golden age for Steinway there were probably pianists and tuners who complained that the best pianos were those made at the end of the nineteenth century. Some pianists today have a fondness for Steinways from the 1920s. But as for what comes out of the factory these days the company's president Bruce A. Stevens is adamant that "older is not better and we can prove it." Sitting behind his big desk in the factory's corner office Stevens declares "Where that started was with people who make their living rebuilding Steinways and they tell their customers that. We've just about given up rebutting it." But not completely. A moment later he is still in full rebuttal mode spitting out words like "poppycock." His frustration continues to boil but he seems to be reining himself in because he is talking to an outsider whose tape recorder is sitting on his desk taking in every word.Steinway has done some modernizing over the decades. Computer-generated bar codes now track the parts of a piano in the making. For years starting just after World War II that was done on paper and when problems arose at the factory Henry Z. Steinway the great-grandson of the company's founder had the final say. The rank and file respected him for more than his name his patrician bearing or his Harvard degree. He understood the old manufacturing methods. Since childhood he had heard about nothing else.Henry Z. Steinway retired in 1980 and machines now cut the wood for the lids and legs operations that were done by hand in his day. "This is furniture making" says Andrew Horbachevsky who as a manufacturing director oversees foremen like Gurrado. But Henry Z. Steinway would recognize much of what goes on at the factory. "There are operations we can't automate" Horbachevsky says. "That would take the soul out of Steinway." One of those operations rim-bending is the one that Gurrado took over in 2002. It has gone unchanged for so long because the piano has gone unchanged for so long.Steinway's earliest grands did not have rigid rims. Steinway made hundreds of pianos before it perfected the design of the rim that will go into K0862 as well as the techniques for making it. One of the Steinway sons C.F. Theodore held more than forty patents and was friendly with the pioneering physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. In marrying the methodology of science to the making of pianos they reasoned that longer and stronger strings would produce a larger and louder sound. But it would also put extreme pressure on the rim.C.F. Theodore Steinway's solution is Gurrado's day-in day-out responsibility: the lamination of rims. Gluing thin strips of wood together creates a better rim than one made from just one or two thick boards because even the glue adds strength. Such a rim is so strong Gurrado says that if you karate-chop two strips that have been glued together the break will come in the wood; the glue joint will hold. Another Steinway relative Theodore Cassebeer the factory manager after World War I improved on C. F. Theodore's handiwork. Until Cassebeer tinkered with it rim-bending had been a two-part process involving separate inner and outer rims. Steinway built the nine boards for the inner rim first using less expensive poplar. The soundboard was glued to that rim; the heavy metal plate was bolted onto it; the strings and the keys were squeezed inside. Only later did the rim-benders fit the eight boards of the outer rim around the piano. If they bent both rims at once the inner rim cracked. It turned out that would not happen if they used maple instead of poplar on the inner rim the same as on the outer rim. The savings in labor easily offset the higher cost of the maple.Laminating the rim was one of the innovations that made possible an instrument with a big sound the grand piano on which Steinway built its reputation. Still the rim is only the structural framework for the piano. It does not contribute to a big-sounding piano's greatness or to a lemon's disappointment. The rim is a big inanimate backstop. The most the rim has to do with the sound is to return "airflow"-the sound waves themselves-to the sounding board for more amplification. Yet that does not give rim-benders license to be sloppy. A rim Gurrado says must meet close tolerances. "It has to" he says "because the parts that are going to fit in it down the road all have to fit in exactly. I mean being that it's mostly a handmade instrument each part is finessed. But it's finessed to a specification. It's not just 'We'll make it fit by cutting off an inch' no."* * *The strips that go into Joe Gurrado's rims are maple-hard-rock maple though that is a term that you will never hear from a forester. The attributes a piano builder will mention are strength and evenness and maybe cost. "You wouldn't build it out of walnut or cherry" Gurrado says. Walnut is almost as hard as maple but far more expensive and it has gnarly swirling grain patterns that make bending difficult. Cherry has a more serious shortcoming: "gum pockets" which are exactly what the term suggests could cause weak spots in a rim. . . .

8,Why India? Why does this distant stiflingly crowded quarrelsome country still ridden with wrenching poverty for hundreds of millions and still unable to free itself of murder and hatred among castes and religions mean so much to the United States - or why should it?Why does it mean so much to me? Long ago I lived here as a correspondent; it was the center of my world. I have lived in other countries and while they remain in mind they become part of my past. Only India still seizes me so emotionally and intellectually so long afterward. I keep thinking about India keep coming back I and those other Americans who felt the pull of India and will for the rest of our lives.For 30 years I have been trying to explain this to friends and to myself. It seems a good time the beginning of a new year a time of re-examination to return to India.I came to find out what India was like after four years of absence. Mostly though I wanted to figure out whether the idea that India was still important to my country and my life was just romanticism and sentimentality arising out of what India had been and I had been or had meaning.
1,PhotoWEDNESDAY PUZZLE — This offering from Kevin Christian and Brad Wilber rocked me out of my midweek blahs. In my view it’s a sassy bluesy grid that was a lot of fun to solve. This puzzle is the solving equivalent of sipping your third Scotch in a dark blues club after midnight. All you know is that you’re having a good time and the band is playing all your favorites.Maybe I liked the disparity between the operatic theme and the sizzling hip clean fill. NORSE GODS are stuck inside the four excellent theme entries: TYR is inside PANTY RAID ODIN inside MOOD INDIGO THOR inside TRUTH OR DARE and LOKI inside HELLO KITTY.But then: We’ve got BOSSMAN and we’ve got our drums on a RISER which I somehow knew. We’ve got the trendy ANIME and HELLO KITTY. Our MOOD is INDIGO. TRUTH OR DARE is probably clued the way it is so that more people will recognize it at this point in the week rather than as Madonna’s tour documentary but that’s O.K. We’ll take an entry like that any way we can get it because it throws off sparks as you move your hand or cursor across the grid. The late ELMORE Leonard the coolest of the cool snapping his fingers in the corner.And we’ve got some delicious wordplay in “Hit bottom?” for SPANK and “Cover of knight?” for ARMOR.I’m frankly surprised they’re not charging a SIN TAX for this one.Not sure of some of the entries here? TELL MAMA and I’ll help you out.Constructors’ Notes:Brad Wilber: Kevin and I met at A.C.P.T. in 2013 and and we thought it would be fun to work on a couple of midweek puzzles together. He had a big notebook of theme ideas and he sent me sort of a buffet of selections. This is the one I chose. He had a group of theme entries that required no tweaking and were all familiar phrases with some panache.He had a nice start on the fill as well. One of my suggestions was to add two white squares to the center to reduce the count of three-letter words and the seven-letter words slid neatly and painlessly in. We discussed just about every corner of the puzzle together so even if it took a bit longer than average to finish it was fun to go over so many fill options.It won’t be easy to do because this was a good one but free your mind and move yourself on to the Thursday puzzle:Your thoughts?

0,The challenge put to The Times's critics was direct: Name a 20th-century work considered ''timeless'' today that you think will be all but forgotten in 100 years. Their selections:'THE NUTCRACKER' A TIRED GIMMICKVisions of sugarplum fairies will continue to dance in our heads through Tchaikovsky's glorious score for ''The Nutcracker.'' The music will endure but as a ballet ''The Nutcracker'' is approaching self-destruction.Although the first staging dates from 1892 the ''Nutcracker'' craze began with George Balanchine's 1954 production for the New York City Ballet. A shrewd mix of spectacle and romantic plot (a child's dream journey into a candy kingdom) has been turned by dance troupes throughout the land into a box-office gimmick.The truth is that ''The Nutcracker'' slim on classical dancing is not the ideal introduction to ballet. Hence the urge to tinker and the spate of revisionist versions: Drosselmeier the little heroine's godfather is now likely to be a child molester. At some point we will prefer an ice show from that other magic kingdom. ANNA KISSELGOFF

0,To the Editor:Re ''Iraqi General Says 4000 Volunteered for Suicide Attacks'' (front page March 31):It's frightening how much death and destruction can be wrought by fanatics. As you say American forces ''boast far superior weaponry and technology but remain vulnerable to fanaticism.''The parallel between what the coalition forces are facing and what the Israeli military faces is clear. This is not about who has more military might but about how much death and injury can be caused by terrorists who hide in hospitals and places of worship who masquerade as civilians and who use women and children as human shields.Regardless of one's views about the timing of this war there is no question that our war in Iraq is a war against terror.SHOSHANA BULOWBronx March 31 2003
9,Two teammates his manager and general manager were among those who testified yesterday in Manhattan on behalf of Steve Howe in his arbitration hearing against major league baseball. The Yankee relief pitcher was permanently suspended last Wednesday for violating baseball's drug policy.Although General Manager Gene Michael Manager Buck Showalter team captain Don Mattingly catcher Matt Nokes and his wife Kristy were among those who spoke on behalf of Howe no decision was reached. The hearing will resume Friday and arbitrator George Nicolau will probably not make a decision until next week.Mattingly said he was asked what type of person he felt Howe was and how people reacted to him. Michael declined to discuss aspects of the hearing but said about nine or 10 players attended as a show of support for Howe.
7,On billboards throughout the Twin Cities area Joe Kapp smiles. Next to him is the slogan “Joe Kapp Can't Lose with Instant Interest” a message from a local bank.Wherever he is Joe Kapp probably is smiling. He usually is. But ironically pro football followers are losing interest in him. As the Minnesota Vikings routed the New York Jets 52‐21 on Sunday night Joe Kapp had become the forgotten quar terback. With the season less than three weeks away he is a free agent after having exercised the option clause in his contract. Following the breakdown in salary negotia tions with the Vikings about a month ago he has remained incommunicado. Ap parently he is not going to be playing this year.“I don't even know where he is right now” Kapp's lawyer John Elliott Cook said by telephone from his Glenbrook Nev. home. “He's a gypsy for the minute but I imagine he'll phone me soon.”Cook represented Kapp in the quarter back's reported demand for a $1.25‐million contract—a $250000 annual salary for five years. Perhaps significantly Kapp had sought out Cook a few years ago after the now retired 71‐year‐old San Francisco law yer had handled the reported $1‐million settlement for John Brodie the 49er quar terback during the merger confusion. When the American Football League was attempting to pirate several National Foot ball League quarterbacks the Houston Oilers promised Brodie a $1‐million deal. After the merger was completed the 49ers and the 25 other teams agreed to fulfill the promise to John Elliott Cook's client.

8,To the Editor:''President Reagan's Drug Bust'' (editorial Nov. 13) makes I feel several pivotal errors in its position on marijuana.Specifically you assert that marijuana's potential health hazards are ''on a par with those of tobacco and alcohol.'' Is this an attempt to legitimize the use of marijuana by playing down the adverse effects of tobacco and alcohol? If so it must be pointed out that smoking remains the single most preventable cause of disease in the United States. Moreover the most widely abused drug with the gravest public health implications (e.g. vehicular accidents homicides suicides) continues to be alcohol. These two substances contribute to the premature death of more than a half-million Americans every year.As for marijuana scientific studies clearly establish a number of negative health consequences associated with its use. For example marijuana smoke contains even more carcinogens and lung irritants than does tobacco. In the short term marijuana can disrupt thinking learning and remembering. High doses can cause hallucinations and create anxiety.Marijuana use leads to as much as a 50 percent short-term increase in heart rate can decrease the blood supply to the heart and cause chest pains.

0,''It seemed like a concept that had never been done or done correctly'' said Jennifer Fine 28 a co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Smartees Inc. ''We get e-mail from parents saying 'Thank you for letting my daughter focus on what she wants to be when she grows up not just on what she wants to wear.' ''One expert still sees room for improvement. ''The more varied the roles that girls see women in the better it is for girls'' said Joan Jacobs Brumberg a Cornell University historian and author of ''The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls.'' But she added: ''The critical thing for me is that they don't all look just like Barbie. Until such time as we can make professional women unglamorous or low-upkeep where their power doesn't depend on their hairdo or their high heels then I think we are sending mixed messages.''Mrs. Fine who displayed pictures of herself in college with long blond tresses -- she called it her Barbie look -- started the company with Jennifer Hamlin whom she met at a cocktail party after they found themselves commiserating about shopping for dolls and finding none that they identified with. They tested a number of concepts with children (one idea Sarah the Senator bombed right off the bat) and rolled out the first dolls in October. Their motto? ''It's not what you look like'' Mrs. Fine said ''it's what you do.''Not wanting to miss the dress-up boat Mrs. Fine and her partner came up with an approach that they thought made putting on a little glittery outfit more ennobling. The Smartees can be modified to wear evening gowns like a one-shouldered purple satin number but they wear them because they have to attend a charity ball to raise money for some worthy cause Mrs. Fine said.That fell flat with one analyst. ''I hope the kids can grasp that subtlety'' said Sean McGowan who has followed Barbie for years for the investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison. ''The level of maturity that is required to understand that a charity ball is not just a party is probably beyond the age group that likes dress-up toys.''Ms. Chavez said she modeled the four Get Real Girl characters on friends of hers. One doll is African-American for example another is part Asian. Each promotes a different sport and when their Web site www.getrealgirl.com is up and running their stories will be detailed there. While their muscle tone contrasts with Barbie's the dolls have similarly idealized features. Their motto is ''Be your own role model.''To develop the line Ms. Chavez joined forces with Michael Cookson founder of Wild Planet a San Francisco toymaker. She still seems somewhat surprised to be in the toy business. ''I wish I had gone into the movement because I am so passionate about human rights'' she said referring to her cousin's farm labor work. Instead she finds herself in the doll aisle and at trade shows trying to persuade store buyers to stock her company's products.

9,President Bush met with Prime Minister Li Peng of China today for the first time since Mr. Li presided over Beijing's crackdown on democracy campaigners in 1989.Mr. Bush went ahead with the chilly 20-minute encounter despite critics' charges that even a brief meeting would buttress the international standing of the Chinese Government and Mr. Li. The President contends that such contacts are worthwhile as a means of tempering Beijing's behavior through dialogue. Hundreds of people protested against the meeting outside.The meeting took place in a conference room here after both leaders attended the summit meeting of leaders of nations represented on the Security Council.Barely an hour before they met the State Department issued its annual worldwide human rights report in which China was accused of an array of abuses and described as a repressive regime "falling far short of internationally accepted norms."

0,We said it here back in December and even though they still haven’t won the Stanley Cup yet against a Penguins team with enormous potential we’ll say it again anyway: the Detroit Red Wings are the gold standard for all of hockey.The Wings were great from the start and except for a stretch in February when they were hit hard by injuries great the whole season long. And they were great in the way they have been for the last several years: by placing a heavy emphasis on winning the regular-season championship and by playing a clean game that shunned fighting.That we should see such a team ascend to the summit of hockey is such a fresh hopeful sign and exactly what the game needs the year after the Stanley Cup victory of the Red Wings’ moral opposites — the cynical fight-instigating Anaheim Ducks with their enormous penalty totals and derision of the Presidents’ Trophy as a useless prize. Because of the Ducks we got this year’s brawling and suspension-ridden Flyers and the fight-happy Calgary Flames and the refusal of NHL clubs to draft Europeans because of “character questions.”If the Red Wings hoist the Stanley Cup in the next handful of days they will have repudiated all of those choices and perhaps shown the way to a better game. Maybe their victory will have the same effect as the Canadiens’ sweep of Philadelphia in the 1976 cup final which helped quell the epidemic of senseless violence brought on by those Flyers and ushered in an era of freer-flowing hockey in its place.Maybe a Wings’ victory will mean that next season NHL teams will actually try to win the regular-season championship — so that if you pay a fortune for a ticket in December you’ll actually see teams giving 100 percent. And maybe those teams instead of starting fights will stick to playing hockey. And maybe finally at long last the voices of reaction will cease their old tired reflexive whine about European softness.Or maybe not. Maybe some retrograde outfit like the Ducks or Flyers will win in 2009 and wipe out the advances the Wings have brought to the NHL this year. But no matter what happens then and no matter what happens Monday night or later in the week one thing remains unchanged: The Detroit Red Wings have given hockey fans an amazing season one that all of us have been lucky to witness.Doing the Double: If the Wings do indeed prevail a fourth time against Pittsburgh they’ll be the 10th team since 1980 to accomplish the utmost feat in a single campaign: winning both the regular-season crown and the Stanley Cup. That 1979-80 season was the year the NHL absorbed 4 WHA sides and expanded to 21 clubs over all and the first season when 16 teams made the playoffs.This is the current roll call of double champions:1981 Islanders1982 Islanders1984 Edmonton1987 Edmonton1989 Calgary1994 Rangers1999 Dallas*2001 Colorado2002 Detroit

9,The Egyptair Boeing 767 that crashed this morning was a relatively new model with a good safety record operated by an airline with extensive international experience and relatively few operational problems although some horrible security failures.The plane was delivered new to Egyptair almost exactly 10 years ago on Sept. 26 1989 and had completed about 6900 flights covering about 30000 flight hours since then -- about normal for a long-range plane of that age.Egyptair operated five 767's including the plane that crashed. It was one of its two extended-range 767-300's the newest version produced by Boeing; it could fly 7080 miles nonstop putting Cairo well within range of New York.Egyptair is one of the world's oldest airlines tracing its operations to 1933. It is owned by the government and a candidate for privatization under a new policy of economic liberalization.

His opponents had called for a boycott of a referendum on whether to continue the so-called Movement system or return to a multiparty system.Based on returns counted by this evening just 40.5 percent of registered voters took part far less than the roughly 75 percent in the 1996 presidential election.''Ugandans have spoken about the Movement system of government'' said Cecilia Atim-Ogwal the leader of one faction of the opposition Ugandan People's Congress. ''They have rejected it totally.''

9,The Bush Administration told Congress today how it will distribute nearly $8 billion in United States foreign aid this year. In an indication of its shifting global priorities the Administration plans a dramatic increase in aid to Poland and a sharp decrease in assistance to most of Central America including El Salvador.The overall amounts for the current fiscal year which began Oct. 1 have already been appropriated by Congress with more than 85 percent of the money earmarked for specific countries and the Administration given discretion in deciding how to spend the rest. No further action by Congress is needed.The draft list of allocations prepared by the State Department and sent to a few members of Congress today shows that economic aid for El Salvador $185 million last year is being reduced to $130.6 million this year. Military aid will be $84.6 million about the same as the $85 million last year.The United States has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the Salvadoran Government and the Administration has vigorously resisted efforts by Congressional Democrats to reduce aid to El Salvador because of human rights abuses.
7,ALEXANDRIA Egypt Aug 2 — Secretary of State Cyrus R.

1,SOLLAR--Siema left us peacefully on the morning of Thursday May 30th with her husband by her side. She was most certainly a woman of valor and an adoring wife mother grandmother and sister-in-law. Siema was a woman of great intelligence and insight with a strong will and indomitable spirit. She used her considerable gifts throughout her adult life to champion the cause of care for the developmentally disabled and to help individuals with developmental disabilities lead lives of dignity and meaning. In this regard Siema always had a special place in her heart for The Maplebrook School in Amenia NY and New England Village in Pembroke MA where her beloved son David currently resides. Siema's passion and creativity were the moving force behind the creation of New England Village's Sollar Wellness Center an innovative facility designed to enrich the lives of those with developmental challenges. She was also deeply involved in numerous other charitable causes and she touched the lives of many people over the course of her lifetime. Siema is survived by her husband Arnold Sollar daughter Marilyn Sollar McCormack son David Sollar son-in-law John McCormack granddaughter Phoebe McCormack and sister and brother-in-law Elaine and Edwin Eisen.

9,TELLINGA Memoir of Rape and Recovery.By Patricia Weaver Francisco.Cliff Street/HarperCollins $23.For many rape survivors the shame fear and anger they feel are often followed by silence. For Patricia Weaver Francisco who was raped in her downtown Minneapolis apartment just before her 30th birthday in 1981 the hush that fell over her was in response to people's reactions. ''Every time I told someone that I had been raped I caused a small explosion'' she writes in ''Telling: A Memoir of Rape and Recovery.'' Five years after her attack Francisco had flashbacks while in labor for 36 hours. She writes that during the moments leading up to the emergency Caesarean section (which saved her baby's life) she felt ''trapped expected to cooperate somehow doomed to accept what is happening to me. I've been here before.'' Thirteen years after the attack the despair returned while Francisco attended the trial of Timothy Baugh who was charged with raping several women in the same Minneapolis neighborhood where she was attacked. Although Francisco's assailant was never caught she took comfort in knowing Baugh -- the surrogate'' -- was convicted. Her intimate account of rape's repercussions includes details about the strain it put on her marriage (she and her husband struggled for 13 years before divorcing) and Francisco's decision to tell her young son about her ordeal. Francisco who teaches creative writing at Hamline University in St. Paul encourages others to start a dialogue about the ''unspeakable'' crime. Francisco warns against keeping quiet: ''Evil is best borne when it's fully visible.'' Nancy Gavilanes

9,''America and Europe will continue to need each other into the 21st century'' Mr. Schmidt said ''but it remains to be seen whether the euro is good for the United States. Some governments will shift dollar-denominated assets into euro-denominated ones which means the U.S. Treasury might have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors.''Mr. Giscard d'Estaing though wishes the euro were not quite so strong at the start. ''The dollar at the moment is a little too weak'' he said. ''I have the feeling the American economy is slowing down a bit and that the American authorities accept that. There will be a dynamic between the euro's spontaneous tendency to strengthen and a monetary policy for the euro that will try to contain that tendency.''The difference in views reflects longstanding divergence in German and French attitudes toward money. For Germany a strong mark was a symbol a defeated nation could take pride in after the war a fact Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he had felt obliged to take into account when he and Mr. Schmidt devised their 1978 plan.''For the Germans the idea of abandoning the Deutsche mark losing it and entrusting it to a bank controlled by governments they did not feel as much confidence in as in their own independent central bank was impossible'' Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said. ''So independence for the European central bank was an essential core idea.''The ease with which the Germans have accepted the end of the mark surprised me and I think it surprised them too. The strict criteria the requirement to cut budget deficits the independence of the central bank in the plan all had the merit of reassuring the Germans.''The idea of a strong central bank found its way into the treaty that spelled out the final plan for the euro more than a decade later though not quite the way Sir Edward would have preferred. Britain alas will not use the euro at least at the start.''Under our original plan the City of London would have been the center of the whole deal'' he said. Instead he added ''it all went to Frankfurt'' where the new European Central Bank is located.
1,Hundreds of thousands of people across the country headed to Chick-fil-A restaurants on Wednesday answering a call from Mike Huckabee the former governor of Arkansas to show support for the fast-food chain after the company’s president drew criticism for his opposition to same-sex marriage.Long lines were seen outside Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide and many customers documented their visits on social media sites and shared their reasons for eating at the chain.Many said they showed up because they agreed with the position of Chick-fil-A’s president on same-sex marriage while others said they wanted to support freedom of expression for business owners.I want to eat at Chick-fil-A because I believe in freedom of speech and religion – regardless of my stance on gay unions. — divadoll123 (@divadoll123) 1 Aug 12As my colleagues Kim Severson and Robbie Brown report from Atlanta where Chick-fil-A began in the 1940s the president Dan T.

So I am asking you kindly to please un-friend me — I have no use for friends like you.”The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation has asked supporters to donate the cost of a meal at a Chick-fil-A about $6.50 to gay and lesbian rights groups.Facebook users are also signing up to participate in a “National Same-Sex Kiss Day” planned for Friday at Chick-fil-A restaurants. People are being encouraged to post photos of their kisses.Others are not waiting until Friday to post their photos.

0,Educators who work with immigrant students are cautioning that the New York City Board of Education may have a hard time teaching parents about the choices they have to make now that the bilingual education system is being overhauled.The parents several educators said are often intimidated by school bureaucracy and often do not have the time to tend to their children's education.The Board of Education voted unanimously on Tuesday to give parents of students who speak little English the chance to choose whether their children go into standard bilingual classes where most classes are taught in a native language an English as a second language program where English is dominant or two newer options a more intensive English as a second language program and a program in which students may be taught in Spanish one day and English the next.The change came after critics charged that parents did not have control over whether to place their children in bilingual or E.S.L. classes and were often not informed about their choices. About 160000 of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren are enrolled in either bilingual or E.S.L. classes with roughly half the total in each program.

9,This Martina II with a radiant smile is lithe at 5 feet 4 inches. Manufacturers are already donating equipment to her. Keretic says she may play in the junior competition at the United States Open in August which would be her first trip ever to the United States. And she can play.The young player who is right-handed with a two-handed backhand was introduced to grass last Thursday by her mother who is also her coach. Today Hingis beat Tzu-Ting Weng of Taipei 7-5 6-3 after her rather undeveloped service was broken three times in the first set. Hingis beat the larger player a day short of her 15th birthday with lobs and drops but also with strong forehands and a growing comfort in going to the net."It's much better how she wins the matches" said Keretic a former West German Davis Cup and tour player based in Hamburg. "Normally the all-round player takes longer to develop. She plays everything. She can stay back and she can force the pace." Doesn't Mind Back CourtsDuring a short interview translated by Eva Keretic the New York-born wife of the manager Hingis said she liked playing on grass at the back courts of Wimbledon."I've played in front of large crowds but here the people are interested in Agassi and Sampras and the others" said Hingis who actually has drawn large crowds of curious fans.The young player will soon return to the small village of Trubbach where her mother is married to a Swiss businessman. Mother and daughter left Czechoslovakia four years ago. Hingis is said to be an A student and likes horseback riding and swimming.Most people who interview her voice concern that her childhood will be cut short by the pro tour."At 14 I will decide whether to turn pro" she said. "I will travel more then. It won't be the same but we are determined to be home as much as possible."

8,''The Ravel also has some jazz elements'' he continued. ''And in the Berlioz the trick is to make clear what the music is depicting. The last five minutes is some of the most extraordinary music ever written and is entirely out of the mainstream of Berlioz's time. Harmony completely breaks down and there is an extremely graphic detailed program. I'd love to do it with supertitles someday. Because after 50 minutes of music there's the danger that listeners will just say 'Oh yes here's the death scene.' It should be more than that: there's some wildly creative dramatic music happening.''In Mr. Wolff's view works with a measure of complexity for the players serve a distinct purpose on a conductor's debut program.''If the pieces are difficult'' he explained ''the orchestra gets focused immediately on the music and not on the personality temperament or age of the conductor. It's a great challenge for a conductor my age to keep the orchestra from thinking about those side issues. My feeling - and if I didn't believe this I'd get out of the business - is that every orchestra gives you the benefit of the doubt at first. Absolutely every one regardless of its reputation or experience wants you to succeed and wants to have an inspiring time. They want that badly and all they require is that you bring enough concentration to your work to make that happen. The moment you fail to give them that the side issues begin to come up.'' The Season's ScheduleSo far Mr. Wolff has prevented his relative youth from becoming an issue. After his week at the Philharmonic he will have conducted all the top five American orchestras except the Cleveland. This season he is also conducting the Toronto Houston Milwaukee and Baltimore orchestras touring with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and leading the New York Philharmonic in a run of summer parks concerts. And he is returning to the National Symphony where he spent six years as an assistant and associate conductor.Mr. Wolff was born in 1953 in Paris where his father was stationed as a Foreign Service officer. Later he lived in London and Washington studied piano in Baltimore with Leon Fleischer and went to Harvard where he studied physics mathematics and chemistry and took piano and composition classes on the side.

0,It’s come to our attention that some readers new to all the mania that is global soccer culture would like a little more annotation geared toward beginners to supplement what one of them calls our “graduate-level material” aimed at those working toward their Ph.D’s. In that spirit freshmen take note: some readers seem not to be aware that the bearded French narrator of those “joga bonito” Nike commercials is not a character actor or at least did not start out as a character actor. He is in fact a former player named Eric Cantona who starred in the 1990’s for Manchester United and briefly the French national team.He did indeed play with flair but was nearly as well known for his frequently violent temper — his official bio chronicles no less than a dozen eruptions — and particularly in England for his Delphic pronouncements at press conferences. Here is a video clip of Cantona from his heyday in action on and off the pitch. You’ll get a glimpse of his famous “karate kick” of a fan who made the mistake of heckling him just after he had been sent off plus some of the headlines that ensued (like “Le Nutter”) and his brilliantly gnomic statement at a press conference later explaining why there were so many reporters there to talk to him about this incident: “When the seagulls follow the trawler it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.” Hard to argue with that. — R.M.
9,Frankie Andreu said before the start of the Tour de France's 19th stage today that his legs were dead and that there was no point in expecting him to join a large early breakaway.No way he said. No legs.Andreu an American rider for the United States Postal Service team sounded convincing even though his goal in this Tour his seventh was identical with his goal in the first six: get in a good breakaway and win a stage. It had not happened yet and there were only three days to go before the finish in Paris on Sunday.A breakaway was expected by nearly all of the 96 riders left because the journey from La Chaux- de-Fonds in Switzerland to Autun in France measured 150 miles and most teams with top sprinters like Mapei and Telekom said that they were too tired to lead a long chase for a chance at a mass rush to the finish.With only 14 of the original 21 teams left after the withdrawal of the last five TVM riders this morning and at least four teams intent on a restful day the road was open to an early acceleration.
0,"DAPHNE." It has taken more than six decades but Strauss's late opera "Daphne" first presented in Dresden in 1938 finally has its first staged production in New York courtesy of the adventurous New York City Opera and directed by Stephen Lawless. One reason this 90-minute work in one act remains a rarity may be its convoluted metaphysical story of a sensual and godly young woman Daphne who fearing mortal life and adult sexuality yearns to be at one with nature. But the main reason the opera despite its lushly harmonic score from Strauss's autumnal period seldom turns up is the challenges it poses to the orchestra the lead soprano and the two supporting tenors. Under the conductor George Manahan the City Opera orchestra acquitted itself admirably. The coloratura Elizabeth Futral had a triumph on opening night as Daphne singing with great agility full but never forced sound touching vulnerability and stamina and scampering about the stage like a nature girl. The tenor Roger Honeywell as the shepherd Leukippos fared better than the tenor Robert Chafin in the killer role of Apollo who compete for Daphne's affections. The whimsically updated costumes were more effective than the pointlessly cumbersome abstract set. Overall though the presentation is a rare chance for New York operagoers to experience a great work. Sunday at 1:30 p.m. New York State Theater Lincoln Center (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $105 (Anthony Tommasini)."THE MAGIC FLUTE." The Amato Opera now in its 57th season stages its productions on modest but generally attractive sets and uses reduced orchestrations and singers who can often be described as enthusiastic amateurs. But there is an evident devotion to opera and its composers in the company's work as well as an intimacy that should well serve the symbolic world of Mozart's "Magic Flute" performed here in English. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 Sunday at 2:30 p.m. The Amato Opera 319 Bowery at Second Street East Village (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $30 $25 for students and 65+ (Allan Kozinn)."OTELLO." Opera buffs who are counting on Ben Heppner to be the Heldentenor of our time were understandably worried when he endured some vocal troubles in recent seasons. So his vocally splendid performance in the daunting title role of Verdi's "Otello" on the opening night of the Metropolitan Opera was something to cheer about. His clarion top notes and dusky-toned middle range singing easily soared over the orchestra and he shaped Verdi's melodies with an elegant suppleness. He may have had opening-night jitters though for dramatically his work was tentative and he seemed too focused on his voice. The soprano Barbara Frittoli as Desdemona was not as much a support as she might have been. Her singing was sumptuous but a little bland. Carlo Guelfi's Iago was also a disappointment vocally robust but dramatically stiff. For the most part James Levine's conducting had organic sweep excitement and great nuance. Now that Mr. Heppner has proved to himself that he can nail this role vocally he will surely take more emotional risks. The overall performance should gain confidence as the run continues. Tonight at 8 Metropolitan Opera House Lincoln Center (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200 (Tommasini)."PLATÉE." There is an element of meanness in Rameau's "Platée" the French baroque comédie-lyrique which has returned to the New York City Opera in Mark Morris's enchanting production. Mr. Morris who directed and choreographed the work does not shy away from the cruelty in the story which surely is just as Rameau intended. To teach his jealous wife Juno a lesson Jupiter pretends to fall in love with Platée a homely part-amphibian marsh nymph who carries on like the grand dame of the swamp creatures. As costumed by Isaac Mizrahi Platée may look ridiculous with her frog skin webbed feet and hands and a sagging breast and tummy disguised by a sheer greenish gown. But as played by the diminutive and riveting tenor Jean-Paul Fouchécourt Platée is an endearing diva. It's funny yes but heartbreaking to see her so blithely duped. The winning cast includes members of the Mark Morris Dance Group wildly costumed as frogs snakes nymphs and such. Daniel Beckwith conducts. New York City Opera. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 New York State Theater Lincoln Center (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115 (Tommasini)."LA RONDINE." Puccini's seldom-heard opera "La Rondine" ("The Swallow") long considered the composer's problem-child opera gets a boost of confidence in a lovely production by the New York City Opera a revival of a staging by the director Lotfi Mansouri from 1995. In "La Rondine" Puccini tries to capture some of the sensibilities of a Viennese operetta so his typically emotive musical voice feels somewhat reined in. But the score filled with Puccini's Italianate brand of Viennese waltzes and some wistfully beautiful melodies wins you over. The soprano Pamela Armstrong gives a poignant and vocally rich portrayal of Magda a courtesan in Paris who runs off to Nice with the smitten young Ruggero but fearing his rejection if he were to know the truth of her past returns to her kept life. Gerard Powers brings boyish charm and a nice warm lyric tenor voice to the role of Ruggero. Also winning are Tracey Welborn as the wry young poet Prunier and Angela Turner Wilson as Lisette Magda's perky maid whom Prunier adores. In his City Opera debut Stephen Lord conducts an undulant account of this undervalued work. Tonight at 8 New York State Theater Lincoln Center (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 (Tommasini).

0,The most powerful warlord in the country Mr. Khan was accustomed to wielding overwhelming military political and economic control in his province and strong influence in the poorer neighboring provinces of Ghor and Badghis. In the two years since the fall of the Taliban he has shown a stubborn disdain for sharing power or heeding the strictures of the central government.As the country prepares for national elections in September and tries to push through a program of disarmament and demobilization of thousands of militiamen Mr. Khan's unchecked power was looming as a serious obstacle.Even as he prepared to bury his son Mr. Khan a former mujahedeen commander famed for his bravery in fighting the Soviet occupation still tried to resist the deployment of the Afghan National Army.''Don't rub salt into our wounds'' he reportedly told President Karzai when informed of the plan by telephone according to a local journalist. ''Karzai said 'It's for your benefit' and cut the phone'' the journalist said.The American commander of the local provincial reconstruction team Lt. Col. James H. Hand said the Afghan troops had received good cooperation so far from the governor and his officials. Buses met the troops and facilities were provided the colonel said.The 13000 American troops in the country are still so busy in the south and east pursuing Taliban forces and hunting for Al Qaeda's leaders that the last thing they want is protracted strife in the west to add to their problems another American officer said.Not satisfied with curbing Mr. Khan's military power major figures in the central government are determined to remove him completely from western Afghanistan offering him a position in Kabul or the governorship of another province. He has refused all offers so far but close aides acknowledge that discussions are in progress.

7,The adaptability of opera to the exigencies of televi sion has long since been demonstrated and although we do not see many operas on the TV screen nowadays it is not because the art form and the medium are incom patible.It is somewhat surprising therefore that England (Brit ish Broadcasting Corpora tion) has elected to turn back the clock as it were and ignore much of what has been learned in the past about the effective presen tation of TV opera in the ex pensive and elaborate per formance of Benjamin Brit ten's “Peter Grimes” that will be shown on Channel 13 (WNDT) at 7:30 this eve ning. (The opera was pre sented in other parts of the country over the N.E.T. net work last night.)•“Peter Grimes” which is now 25 years old is prob ably the best‐know and best liked mid‐20th‐century op era. Its style is rooted in the past but its psychological overtones and moderately modern musical idiom give it a continuing contemporary flavor. Based on a poem by George Crabbe the libretto by Montagu Slater recounts the tragedy of a lonely am bitious fisherman.This performance was taped at Aldeburgh Festival Hall in England in February 1969. The composer conduct ed and Joan Cross was the stage director. Instead of using the multiple‐studio technique developed years ago to achieve maximum word clarity and judicious balances between singers and instruments over‐all miking was used. And medi um and long‐shot photogra phy to emphasize environ ment was favored over close‐ups that stress char acter impact.

8,At present the Labor Party holds a 25-seat majority. The comparison however is somewhat misleading because the House of Representatives has been increased for this election from 125 seats to 148 seats a result of recent redistricting to reflect population changes.The campaign has not been filled with sharp debates over issues mainly because Mr. Hawke has transformed his party from an often shrill advocate of trade unionism into a champion of economic growth and cooperation between labor and management. Thus he has successfully captured the middle ground of Australian politics undercutting the conservative opposition.''Australia is conservative and so is Bob Hawke'' said Don Aitkin a professor of political science at the Australian National University in Canberra. Booming Economy Is FactorIn his 21 months in office Mr. Hawke has benefited from an end to a long drought in Australia and a worldwide economic recovery led by the United States. But in addition Mr. Hawke hammered out an accord soon after he took office between labor and management to restore growth reduce inflation and avoid strikes in a nation with a tradition of labor strife. The agreement was accomplished in dramatic fashion at a national economic meeting in April 1983 and it has worked far better than most people at first thought possible.Today the Australian economy is growing at a 10 percent annual rate and inflation is at its lowest point since 1970. For its part unemployment has dropped by almost 2 percent.
9,Michael D. Eisner the Walt Disney chairman and one of the most ferociously ambitious people in Hollywood has hungered for a television network for nearly a decade. And while there are many business reasons for buying Capital Cities/ABC the personal ones are just as important.Mr. Eisner who is 53 was drawn to ABC because it is the No. 1 television network in prime time and news its daytime viewers have the most appealing demographics its cable holdings (including the ESPN sports network) are especially lucrative and its family-oriented programs fit Disney's credo. ABC in fact calls itself the family network.Beyond that though Mr. Eisner's ego needed a deal like this one. The $19 billion plan to acquire Capital Cities/ABC announced today comes at a time when Mr. Eisner has not fully recovered from a year of setbacks including heart bypass surgery last summer the unexpected death of Frank G. Wells his No. 2 in a helicopter accident 15 months ago and the acrimonious departure of a longtime associate Jeffrey Katzenberg who was chairman of the studio in September. Other top executives as well as some important animators have also left.Mr. Eisner said today that the deal "is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create an outstanding entertainment and media company." Appearing today on ABC's "Good Morning America" with Thomas S. Murphy chairman of Capital Cities/ABC Mr. Eisner said the deal came together at a business conference last month in Sun Valley Idaho.

0,FROM Route 9H you can just glimpse Talavera a yellow Greek revival mansion with white trim and fluted columns. The house serenely overlooking the Catskills and the Berkshires seems deliberately hidden as you wind your way up a long driveway. Only as you reach the foot of the spacious lawn does Talavera reveal itself in all its faded elegance subject to the inroads of time but occupied in unbroken succession by the Van Ness and Philip families for nearly 200 years.Every fall some 2000 city dwellers and suburbanites make their way to the orchards around back where descendants of the original owners are making ends meet by running a pick-your-own-apple business. Apples cost $14 to $16 a bushel depending on the variety which includes McIntoshes Northern Spy Mutsu and Jonagolds. The family also sells heritage tomatoes and pears -- among them Anjou rare on the East Coast and Harrow Sweet.''My great-great-aunts would have died to see me in pants and down there taking money'' said Leila Philip 40 an English professor at Colgate University in Hamilton N.Y. ''But it's an important job that needs to be done. I enjoy the people and I feel it connects me to a long history.''The Philip family's once extensive land holdings in Columbia County -- 294 acres in 1732 -- have diminished to 125 acres. In 1992 when Ms. Philip's father John Van Ness Philip Jr. died it looked as though the family might lose the place forever. The cost of labor machinery and materials had risen drastically in recent years and apples could be raised more cheaply outside the United States.

9,By rejecting insistent Bosnian demands today that the United Nations either send soldiers to defend Sarajevo or let the Muslims there buy arms freely to do the job themselves Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has upped the stakes for his organization in its efforts to resolve the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Throughout a long and difficult day of constant heckling by Sarajevo's residents the Secretary General insisted over and over again that the only way forward was through negotiation and dialogue not guns and fighting and that the omens were good."I believe 1993 will be the year of peace for Bosnia" he said repeatedly. Power Seems to Be SlippingA success would clearly raise his own prestige hugely along with that of the United Nations. But it is equally clear that another failure would deliver a serious blow to the organization's reputation as a peacemaker at a time when after a string of early post-cold-war successes its powers seem to be slipping in several parts of the world.
0,To the Editor:Re ''A Global Warning to Mr. Bush'' (editorial Feb. 26):Before putting pressure on the White House to act shouldn't we be asking whether global warming is really happening?The Kilimanjaro ice cap is not a thermometer. It may well be melting but this is simply a delayed consequence of a natural climate warming during the early part of the 20th century. Moreover it will continue to melt as long as the climate doesn't return to the temperatures of the Little Ice Age of past centuries.The National Academy of Sciences published a report last year that defines the geographic regions of warming and cooling during the last 20 years. Surface measurements of East Africa show no warming trend. Weather satellites show a pronounced cooling trend of the atmosphere there.S.

0,With his sweep in Virginia North Dakota and Washington Gov. George W. Bush's troubled presidential campaign has wrung an essential victory from three disparate states. But once again Senator John McCain pointed up the soft spot in Mr. Bush's candidacy by drawing strong support in Virginia and possibly elsewhere among independents moderates and Democratic crossovers. Mr. Bush's partisans argued last night that Senator McCain's challenge to religious fundamentalists had backfired rallying loyal Republicans to the governor's side. All of the results set up a tremendously important showdown in the March 7 ''Super Tuesday'' primaries. The battleground states of California and Ohio where Mr. Bush leads and in New York which is a toss-up may well determine whether Mr. McCain will be remembered as a transforming or a transitory figure in the G.O.P.For the Democrats Vice President Al Gore's victory in Washington State threatens yet another blow to former Senator Bill Bradley's candidacy. Mr. Bradley needed at least a credible showing against Mr. Gore in order to revive his chances in New York and California where he has been running behind. A bad defeat when all the votes in Washington are counted could feed pressures on him to withdraw.For both parties yesterday's voting set the stage for a more nationalized phase of the nominating process. Republicans everywhere are wondering whether Mr. McCain's daring attempt to redefine his party is an act of historic farsightedness or self-destruction. The party's establishment is working hard to push Mr. Bush to the nomination and his triple win will restore their wavering faith. But they are not yet sure whether to ignore Mr. McCain's disturbing message that catering to religious conservatives is becoming an outdated strategy especially outside the Sun Belt.Mr. McCain's success so far has arisen from his ability to set the terms of the debate. To that end it was smart of him to reverse his decision to skip the final debate before the March 7 round of primaries. By agreeing to participate from a live hookup in New York Mr. McCain shores up his support in New York and the New England states that vote on Super Tuesday. Mr. McCain's future may depend on how much strength he shows in those states given Mr. Bush's expected appeal in the Southern states voting that day.

9,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: Students will first explore the power of the visual image to convey a message by examining the portrait of George Washington on American dollar bills. They next use today’s featured article ‘Prolific Chinese Painter Is Anonymous No More’ to learn about a famous portrait of Mao and what the artwork reveal about the People’s Republic of China. In small groups students next will examine images of important personages in various cultures throughout the world and finally create their own portraits that convey messages they wish others to understand about themselves.Author(s):Abby Remer The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Examine the message conveyed by George Washington’s portrait on American dollar bills.2. Learn about a similarly famous portrait of a past leader in China and consider the message it is meant to communicate by reading and discussing “Prolific Chinese Painter Is Anonymous No More.”3. Explore the messages that artworks of important people convey in various cultures throughout the world.4. Create their own portraits to communicate something important about themselves to others.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-copies of “Prolific Chinese Painter is Anonymous No More” (one for each student)-assortment of global art history books (see step 3)-sketch paper-large sheets of drawing paper (one for each student)-drawing materials (markers crayons pastels etc.)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/HOMEWORK: Have students look at the portrait on American dollar bills posing the following questions: “Who is this person? What do you think the artist wanted us to believe about George Washington? (Look at his expression? Is he someone you might trust or feel confident in? Does he look like he might easily become unnerved?) What is the significance of having this image on a dollar bill?”2. Now explain that the class will read the article “Prolific Chinese Painter Is Anonymous No More” to learn about a famous portrait of Mao the founder of the People’s Republic of China which turns 50 on October 1 1999. Discuss the following questions together:a. Why is the location of Mao’s portrait significant?b. What does the writer mean when he writes “The portrait has seemed to preside over the nation unchanged sturdy as a piece of Communist architecture no matter how drastically China itself was being transformed”?c. Why didn’t people in China originally know who painted Mao’s portrait?d. Why does Wang Qizhi keep painting the same portrait?e. How does Mr. Wang feel about having remained anonymous for so many years?f. How does the artwork offer “a thread of continuity” throughout the tumultuous half-century of communist rule?g. Why do some Chinese people perceive Mao’s portrait favorably?h. Why do others dislike Mao? What were some of the negative aspects of his leadership?i. How does Mr. Wang’s son feel about Mao? Why did Mao target the arts in the 1960s?j. Did Mr. Wang entirely create every version of his famous Mao portrait?k. What political message did the Central Committee of the Communist Party feel was inappropriate in the original version of the painting?l. Why might Mao’s portrait offer some comfort during the China’s current changes?3. Divide the class into small groups each one focusing on the way a particular culture portrays important people. You might have students examine paintings and sculptures of:. Egyptian pharaohs. Roman politicians and intellectuals. 17-19th century British aristocracy. French emperors and kings. American presidents and social figures (e.g. Rockefeller Morgan Carnegie). African royalty. Mayan religious leaders. 17th century Dutch burghersLooking at their assigned image students in each group should together discuss and then individually answer the following questions in their journals:. How did the artist convey the person’s importance? Consider size media stance facial expression accompanying objects setting and so forth.. What might ordinary people have felt gazing upon this artwork?. How might the artist have felt creating such a work?. How would you have felt creating this artwork?4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Explain to students that they are going to create a portrait of themselves. As you distribute art supplies to students have them list characteristics they would like visually to convey to others about themselves. Then have them begin sketches and finally their portraits which they can complete at home or in a subsequent class. Create an “Impressive Portraits” exhibition and have the class discuss what each student artist seems to have wanted to communicate to others.Further Questions for Discussion:–Is all art meant to persuade or convey a message?–Is art that is created for political purposes different from art that is created for the sole pleasure of viewing? If so how and if not why not?–Would you have wanted to remain anonymous if you had painted Mao’s famous portrait? Why do you think Wang Qizhi accepted this condition for so long?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on their written journal entries participation in class and small group discussions and thoughtful and imaginative participation in small group research and discussion as well as their ability to express something about themselves in a visual manner.Vocabulary:Beijing Communist Tiananmen Square officialdom prominent industrious suppressing acquaintances burdensome appreciation retiree displaced wake collective fervor idealism avocation scaffolding intolerantExtension Activities:1. Compare examples of traditional Chinese court portraiture to the portrait of Mao. What are the differences visually as well as in their messages?2. Research portraiture throughout American history. How has the style who is portrayed and the messages conveyed changed over time? How do these expressions compare to Wang Qizhi’s painting of Mao?3. Write a diary entry as Wang Qizhi for the day he completed the first Mao portrait and one for October 1 1999 the fifty year anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. How might his feelings about his work and China have changed or not over time?4. Role-play a discussion about the criteria for significant art between Wang Oizhi and a western art historian who considers originality and uniqueness of great importance.5. Investigate Robert Wilson’s monumental performance piece “Nixon in China” (through videotape or audio recording). What does this art form convey about former President Nixon’s landmark 1972 visit to China? What “message” might Wilson have tried to make in this piece?6. Write letters between Mr. Wang and his son regarding their views on Mao and the importance of Chinese traditional art.7. Find examples in various cultures of other art forms meant to glorify important people-including architecture music dance songs theater and so forth.8. Research the official portraits of each president of the United States. Compare them in terms of demeanor style and the message they communicate about each president. Also investigate the process of selecting the artist and how he or she undertakes this commission. If you were selected today how would you portray the current president?Interdisciplinary Connections:Foreign Language- For those languages that you are studying in class or are represented by the students’ heritage research the way artists depict important people. How might the art represent the values of these cultures?Global History- Examine the New York Times special online resource “Issue in Depth: Communist China at 50″ (//www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/index-china.html). Looking at the time line (//www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/china-index-timeline.html) describe the evolution of Mao’s influence over the last 50 years.-What was Mao’s Cultural Revolution of 1965? Why was it called a “cultural” revolution? Did the dramatic changes come from within the artistic community or from without? How does this compare to other revolutions throughout the world in history? Why might Mao have focused so much attention on culture? What power do you think he perceived culture to potentially have on people?Journalism- Explore photojournalism. How do journalists use pictures to relate a story and get a message across? How do photojournalist articles differ from those that only are text based?Science- Interview a museum conservator about the potential damage to art especially pieces exhibited outside-from sun smog and humidity and other factors. What ideas might they offer to avoid having to continually repaint Mao’s portrait?Using the Times- Read and evaluate art reviews about Chinese contemporary and traditional art. How do the artworks in these exhibits reflect the values of the artists and of Chinese society at the time in which they were created?Other Information on the Web:A China: Timeline at (//learning.turner.com/coldwar/china/chna_tml.html) provides Educator Guide to episode 15 of CNN’s COLD WAR: Chinese communists are victorious.

8,Of all the people who populate the lane outside the kitchen window the pole banger is the most insistent. But Rani while she was there was the most fetching. The street is not the same without her.It is still lively enough. A constant stream of people hustle by. Pushcarts and ice-cream vendors and candy sellers make regular rounds. Occasionally an elephant lumbers by.At night there is the pole banger. He is a night watchman who patrols the immediate streets banging a big iron pole on the pavement as he goes - some also blow whistles - to scare criminals away.But it is Rani's clan three generations of hand-to-mouth working people perhaps two dozen individuals in all who spill out of the open-front dwelling cubicles across the way to take over the lane. Setting up string beds on both sides of the street they convert it village style into a sitting room under the trees where they banter gossip quarrel hope plan sleep and suffer when sick.

0,Reader responses to Marjane Satrapi’s post “Defending My Country.”Taraneh Kayhani Ferdman San Juan Puerto Rico: Just want to congratulate you on your clever message your balanced view on life and of course your striking illustrations! You make us all Iranian-born women and men very proud to have your voice heard in The New York Times.Sylvia Notini Bologna Italy: As an American who teaches English at the University of Bologna I know a lot about defending Americans who are patriotic and against the war at the same time. It is hard for me to find a way to tell my students that I am just as horrified as they are by many of the bad things that Europeans read about Americans — that some Americans condone torture that a presidential election can be questionable that some people can believe that saying “freedom fries” instead of “French fries” will help make the world a better place. So I am grateful to The New York Times online for having allowed me to discover Marjane Satrapi whose columns I can bring to class not only to help me teach English but also and above all to send a message to my students about the country I love.Ken Hudson: I’m an American who served honorably and proudly for one year in Iraq. I came to know appreciate admire and even fell in love with Iraqi people. I reject your assertion that we imposed democracy by bombing the Iraqi people. The bombing that did take place was strategic and precise and it killed bad people who deserved to die. The world is a better place because of many of the evil people killed by American bombs. Saddam Hussein is on trial for crimes against humanity [his sons] Uday and Qusay are DEAD and there are no more rape and torture chambers under the sanction of Iraq’s government.Elodie Sutton Washington: As a French-American I often find myself having to defend either culture to friends and even family from both sides of the pond. Thank you for capturing and illustrating so eloquently the issues at hand. I think every American should read your article.Beverly Tan Miami: Cheers Ms. Satrapi! Your illustrations are fabulous as always and the piece really resonated with me. Like you I sometimes feel as if I am caught in a crossfire of rhetoric. I am ethnically Chinese and the Bush administration has been particularly vociferous in deeming China a hotbed for human rights violations. Simultaneously this same administration is wantonly bombing Iraq into oblivion to install a democratic government — whose actual goal is to guarantee the United States a steady supply of cheap gas. My hope is that other readers in the global community will understand that not every American is of the Freedom Fry variety. Many of us have tirelessly campaigned against Bush’s policies and have been incensed and embarrassed to watch this so-called leader blunder his way through delicate international protocol. This is not the America that our forefathers fought for. Bush is not the leader that I chose and he does not speak for me just as he does not speak for many other Americans.Maria New York: I must admit that until I read “Persepolis” I too thought that Iran was a mysterious country full of mysterious and very grumpy people. But you showed me that indeed Iranians are people very similar to Americans in that they love their country and are either in agreement with the regime in power or are very saddened to see their country run into the ground. We do not however have to endure the pain of not being able to make our lives at home. That is a tragedy and I sincerely hope that one day that will change.Judy Parker New York: Right on Marjane! The number of us against this stupid president’s policies and black/white thinking are growing. If only our government will grow with us . . . meanwhile please keep spreading the word that there are many of us independent non Bible-belt thinkers in the U.S.Mona Boston: Thank you for a funny but so true story. I was born in Iran grew up in Paris and now live in Boston. In the United States I often hear people say they don’t like us over there — meaning France. When in France I have to tell many times the story of the warm and caring hug I got from an old man George on 9/11 in Boston because we were both in tears. It takes a lot of effort to defend three countries. From now on I will just travel with your cartoon in my back pocket. Merci!Steve Denes New York: What a wonderfully clear and concise statement Ms. Satrapi makes about defending “the other.” When I worked in Nigeria I had to explain Americans to Nigerians; now I have to explain Nigerians. Because I was born in Hungary I have to do the same and vice versa. Because I worked in East Harlem as a white man I had to explain that and vice versa. Because I married someone of another faith I explain that as well. I never see this as an obligation but rather as an opportunity and luxury. I think Ms. Satrapi would agree.Ahmad Ramsheyi Paris: As an Iranian educated in the United States and living in France I share Majane Satrapi’s point of views on Bush’s shameful war on humanity. American people are wonderful people but a lot too naïve — to the point of putting their trust in the hands of crooked politicians who care only for themselves and tell people lies. Thank you Ms. Satrapi. We need you.Julie Nauman Paris: As an American living in Paris who has also lived in the Muslim world all I can say to you is thanks. I also find myself defending France Muslims and of course the United States. We are diplomats of the world! If only I could do it with your charming drawings.
8,With increasing frequency young adults in Manhattan are turning to singles programs set up by churches and synagogues for their social life according to clergymen and social scientists.''A new kind of immigrant has come to Manhattan - the single professional - and churches and synagogues are being forced to adapt'' said the Rev. Kevin V. Madigan a Roman Catholic priest who runs the Yorkville Outreach Program a Catholic organization that serves single adults on the Upper East Side.''Here you have people whose dream it was to come to New York and who face crushing pressures at work'' he said. ''They want a place to turn to meet people who have the same value systems.''While at first they may attend for purely social reasons single people are providing a new source of congregants for churches and synagogues whose memberships declined sharply in recent decades the clergymen said.

7,DETROIT Sept. 2—The four United States automobile mak ers reported today a 7 per cent decline in sales of American type cars in the final third of August compared with the similar period last year.Sales from Aug. 21 through 31 totaled 185725 cars down from 199360 in the like period a year ago.For the entire month of August sales were down 5 per cent to 525731 from 554986 a year before.But the major news in Detroit today was that the United Auto Workers said it would strike the General Mo tors Corporation or the Chrys ler Corporation or both at midnight on Sept. 14 if it did not have a new contract by then. The general belief among industry observers is that G.M. alone will be the target of a U.A.W. strike.In the final third of August all the car makers except Chrysler show a decline in sales. The sales for Aug. 21–31:

1,I’d just finished a family session one Thursday morning when my emergency line rang. A faint voice croaked: “Dr. Deitz. Please. Can you help me?”Klix Photo Studio Trumbull Conn.A woman I’d been treating for more than 14 years was calling but I barely recognized her voice. She and I had been through many difficult periods over that time: her agitated depression as a 28-year-old newlywed which led to the diagnosis of bipolar disorder; a disabling postpartum depression two years later when her daughter was born; her daughter’s leukemia at age 5 when my patient spent her nights maniacally scouring the Internet for experimental treatments.This time was different. I’d never heard her sound so disconsolate. I asked her what was wrong trying to recall our last session. (The details of our conversation have been changed to protect my patient’s privacy.)“I can’t get out of bed” she said. “Remember how my sister and I are rowing this weekend? If I back out now she’ll never speak to me again.” Rigorous exercise and a powerful attachment to her siblings the core of her social network were her major coping strategies. “Can I see you today? Maybe you can adjust my medicine” she said.We arranged an appointment for that afternoon. She managed to make it to my office her face taut and pasty her sweat suit drooping about her lanky body like a shroud.“I don’t know what happened” she replied when I asked what made her so depressed. “I felt fine when I left here two weeks ago. And now this” she said sounding defeated. “I got depressed for no reason.”“For no reason?” I echoed rephrasing her statement into a question. I remembered previous times when her moods fluctuated viciously in reaction to stresses of which she was unaware.“Nothing I can think of” she answered in a monotone.“Are you sure? Really sure?” I pressed urgently.“There is one thing” she said. She then started into her recollection of a conversation she’d had the previous weekend with a pushy woman she barely knew.“This is what she said” she continued mimicking the woman’s finger-shaking and fire-and-brimstone tone: “I can tell from your description of your daughter you’ll see what a handful she will be. Just wait until she hits puberty. My daughter didn’t want anything to do with me for years. She still treats me like a stranger.” The more my patient talked about that encounter the more energized she became perking up in front of me like a wilted plant that’s been watered.“So something did happen” I said underscoring that her mood change didn’t happen in a vacuum. I asked her what that woman’s statement meant to her.She began to weep then sob as if her daughter had died. “I can’t bear the thought of losing her” she said. “We’re so close. The idea she won’t want anything to do with me is overwhelming.”I asked her if the woman had a degree in child development.“I doubt it.” Her forehead relaxed.“The woman didn’t evaluate your daughter psychologically did she?” I added dryly.“No. She wasn’t a therapist.”“She couldn’t be” I said semi-indignantly. “Besides what kind of person dumps such a load of garbage on someone she hardly knows? Imagine being that woman’s child. I wouldn’t talk with her either.”She smiled.“As for your daughter” I said “let’s not jump to conclusions. I’ve seen you two many times in the waiting room. Not that adolescence is a Sunday stroll but I think the two of you will do just fine.”“You really think so?” she asked.“Absolutely.”“I never looked at it that way” she said grinning the tension in her neck and shoulders melting away.“Good” I said. “Let me know how your regatta went.”My patient called the following Monday. “It was great” she said. “Until we talked I had no idea how much that woman upset me.”Looking back I did nothing extraordinary. I delivered competent therapy; effective therapy. I presented my patient with a different perspective punctuated with humor empathy and conviction — something my colleagues do every day.I helped her become aware of her powerful but unconscious reaction to the pushy woman reframing their interaction while playfully confronting her tendency to idealize authority figures. I also affirmed she need not be a victim of her perceptions and mood. By viewing her situation in a different light I led her do the same resulting in a rapid mood improvement.And unlike medications for depression which take weeks to become effective while symptoms abate gradually her immediate reaction to psychotherapy speaks to a different mechanism of action and confirms what neuroscientists are demonstrating: social interactions including psychotherapy turn on brain circuits instantaneously. Why? Because humans are social animals; we’re wired to connect.Neurons in the premotor cortex and the somatosensory cortex — mirror neurons as they’re known — fire in synchrony with the behavior and feelings of others attuning people’s brains. When a person sees someone smiling some of the observer’s smile-controlling neurons are turned on too. Or when someone winces in pain the corresponding sensory neurons in the observer fire away in sympathy.The premotor cortex command central with respect to voluntary behaviors is where decisions to act are made. Evolutionarily it’s a tremendous advantage to learn coping through observation and imitation — mirror neurons’ raison d’être — whether learning to harness fire to deal with the elements or learning to self-regulate self-soothe or self-reflect or any of the other myriad coping skills that modulate mood.Think of how it feels for the depressed person whose pervading negativism colors his or her thoughts feelings and behavior to be with an optimistic yet not Pollyannaish person who radiates confidence warmth and humor while affirming that situations can be interpreted differently; how refreshing and hope-engendering it is to be with someone who not only understands one’s misery but says something that makes a difference.I’m not implying that a single encounter in the therapist’s office can cure depression. But a major psychotherapy goal for all patients is to turn on coping routines on their own.Even experiences with strangers can powerfully influence mood when the chemistry and the neurophysiology is right. People who start therapy for example frequently talk of hitting it off with their therapist and of leaving the initial sessions feeling hopeful. Research confirms that liking one’s therapist early on and feeling that the therapist tunes in well to one’s issues bodes even better for therapy than the therapist’s experience or training.The effective therapist offers more than sympathy; by empathizing with his patient’s suffering he confronts distortions and maladaptive behavior and mirrors healthy coping. Good therapy is lively sometimes playful but always interactive and full of genuine humanity. Ineffective therapy may neither help nor harm but improperly conducted therapy ranging from overly passive to dictatorial and cruel — no matter how it’s couched and rationalized — leaves patients dejected or worse hurt and turned off.One small disclaimer: although good therapy has no side effects it may become habit-forming.Jeff Deitz M.D. is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in Connecticut and New York City. He teaches at the Beth Israel Medical Center.Note: The post has been updated to make clear that details concerning the patient’s life were changed to protect her privacy and some references have been removed.Dr. Pauline Chen’s Doctor and Patient column will return next week.
8,The Brooklyn Philharmonic and the Next Wave Festival joined forces over the weekend to present three concerts of a program of determinedly post-modernist European orchestral music in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House. Each score was a major effort lasting between 25 and 33 minutes. There was one post-modernist ''greatest hit'' and three premieres and it was the hit that proved the highlight of Friday evening's performance.Arvo Part the Estonian composer who now lives in West Berlin is one of several composers (among them Alfred Schnittke and Sofiya Gubaidulina) who have received the partisanship of Gidon Kremer the Soviet violinist who also now lives in the West. Mr. Part's score ''Tabula Rasa'' has won particular praise for its religio-mystical Eastern European gloss on Minimalist precepts. The means are simple but the ends are profound.Just how Mr. Part achieves this profundity compared to simple-minded imitations that use similar tactics to far lesser effect is a quandary. With busy complex scores one can avoid the issue of artistic worth by dwelling on the complexities. With Minimalism one is forced to fall back on essentials.''Tabula Rasa'' which lasted 27 minutes is in two movements scored for two solo violinists (Mr. Kremer and Tatyana Grindenko) strings and prepared piano which acts like a distant percussion battery. In the first movement the strings establish a slow restful pulse like a heartbeat and the violinists weave ethereal traceries in upper positions and harmonics. In the second movement it is the soloists who delineate the pulse punctuated by more varied string textures and a periodic effect that sounds like a distant tolling bell. The result is either restful (there were several peaceful sleepers in my immediate proximity) or consoling; I stayed awake and was consoled.

0,Knicks and knacks from the lovely press box at Citizens Bank Park…As expected the Mets placed Jorge Sosa on the disabled list this morning to create room on the roster for today’s starter Mike Pelfrey. An MRI confirmed the strain in Sosa’s left hamstring but Willie Randolph did not want to speculate as to how long Sosa could be out.Nor did Randolph sound all that certain about Oliver Perez’s status. Perez seemed confident that the stiffness in his lower back would subside so he could start Tuesday in Colorado but Randolph brought up the possibility of putting Perez on the disabled list retroactive to Wednesday and letting him rest through the All-Star break. If that happened they would have to recall a pitcher from the minors. Jason Vargas would be the most likely option but is scheduled to pitch today for Class AAA New Orleans. The Mets could always pull him.If Perez remains in the rotation here’s what it looks like heading into the All-Star break:In DenverMonday: Tom GlavineTuesday: Oliver PerezWednesday: Orlando HernandezIn HoustonThursday: John MaineFriday: PelfreySaturday: GlavineSunday: Perez**********************************************************************The Philadelphia Inquirer ran several stories including one above the fold on A1 and two consecutive pages inside the sports section on the Phillies’ “Phabulous Phutility.” They are four losses away from 10000 and Julio Franco who contrary to popular opinion has not been alive for all of them was very impressed with the presentation. “Look at all this history” he said.Franco began his career in the Phillies’ organization in 1978 when he ate Kentucky Fried Chicken three meals a day for their rookie-league team in Butte Mont. and played 16 games for them in 1982 before being traded with four others to Cleveland for Von Hayes. “The best thing that ever happened to me” Franco said.

7,T??e high cost of housin?? res??lts from many factors.

Rose Jr. chair man of North American Mortgage Investors one of the new real estate invest ment trusts that have sought in the last couple of years to channel money from in vestors into housing.“For one thing the reces sion this year has deferred a lot of demand for housing. The money that we've seen coming into the market lately will be sopped up in no time.”Mr. Rose was one of the more than 4000 mortgage bankers lenders and Govern ment officials who spent last week assessing the state of home finance across the country. Investment trusts such as his have already poured $1.6‐billion into con struction loans—most of it money that would not other wise have found its way into housing production. The trusts enable small investors who cannot buy mortgages because of their high denom ??ations to own shares in an entity that in turn provides mortgage money.Life insurance companies once a vital source of resi dential mortgage money have largely abandoned the field for two principal rea sons. Most insurance compa nies have suffered a cash outflow in the period of ris ing interest rates of the last few years as policy holders have exercised their right to borrow at 5 per cent and 5½ per cent interest on their policies reinvesting the bor rowed funds at higher pre vailing interest rates.
1,WASHINGTON — LET’S stop being so hard on Donald Trump.He has done us an enormous public service.After this down-and-dirty battle of the sexes we will never look at gender in politics the same way.For centuries women were seen as unfit to hold public office. Ambition power and business were the province of men. Unlike gossipy feminine chatter in the parlor manly discourse was considered impersonal unemotional forthright and reasonable.Every minute of every day Trump debunks that old “science” when he shows that the gossipy backbiting scolding mercurial overly emotional shrewish menopausal one in this race is not the woman.Trump is surrounded by a bitchy sewing circle of overweight men who are overwrought at the prospect of a distaff Clinton presidency.

0,When the Rangers were struggling to score earlier this season losing mind-boggling games by scores of 1-0 or 2-1 their opponents were all too happy to pounce on their weakness.Now the Rangers are in the middle of a friendlier stretch pouncing on other teams when they are down. On Thursday they played an Islanders team whose goalie Rick DiPietro clearly needs a break. They knocked four goals by him while he was consistently — and uncharacteristically — out of position. Then on Saturday they met an Ottawa team that can barely get out of its own way in a six-game losing streak and won 5-2.Coming on Monday is a date with Carolina which prepared for its trip to Madison Square Garden by getting waxed 8-1 by Buffalo Saturday night.Predictably the Rangers are not gloating about any of this. They were particularly kind in their assessment of Ottawa the once-and-probably-future power team in the Eastern Conference.“Ottawa I think it having a bit of a tough stretch right now as everybody does” said Rangers Coach Tom Renney. “And we respect that as much as anybody because we’ve been through that. That’s hockey. So if there’s a gap that’s been closed it’s a combination of we played better and they’re having a bit of a tough time right now.”Clearly though the Rangers are figuring some things out. Jaromir Jagr has scored in three straight games. Brendan Shanahan scored twice against Ottawa to give himself nine goals for the season. The power play has stopped looking like a Three Stooges routine and has scored four goals in two games.So instead of showering pity on the Senators Saturday they decided to feel good about themselves.“It’s good for us knowing we can come up here and play a very solid game” said goalie Henrik Lundqvist. “We haven’t won that many times up here. I’m very happy the way we played not just for the two points. The way we played in the first period I think was the best so far this year.”

8,Jules Kirschenbaum (Forum Gallery 1018 Madison Avenue between 78th and 79th Streets): Jules Kirschenbaum is one of the more complex painters now working in a realistic idiom. His work is allegorical filled with literary allusions and deeply introspective; at the same time it not only contains images of Japanese erotica but also the paint and texture sometimes seem to breathe sexuality. While his work could hardly be more meticulous in its rendering of objects Kirschenbaum also twists and turns his pictorial space in search of the visionary.A handful of works in this show leave no doubt about his gifts. In ''David Harris Playing Scarlatti'' a pianist is lost in his playing while the body of the piano and the fantastic shapes on the inside of the lid begin to float into space. In ''Auto da Fe III'' a figure sits at a table scratching his head surrounded by a painting by Giovanni Bellini a painting by Grunewald an erotic Japanese print and Uccello's ''Battle of San Romano.'' One of the horses in the Uccello has tumbled out of the painting and lies on the studio floor. In ''Studio II'' there is an almost excruciating tension between a voluptuous female nude model seated alone in the middle of a studio and the suggestively masculine forms all around her. (Through Wednesday.)''Between Abstraction and Reality'' (Marilyn Pearl Gallery 38 East 57th Street): I hope that ''Between Abstraction and Reality'' will inspire a larger and more disinterested exhibition. This show's subject is a tendency in contemporary American painting to combine landscape and abstraction in a way that continues the tradition in American painting of Albert Pinkham Ryder Arthur Dove and Marsden Hartley. Unrepresentative works by Georgia O'Keeffe Dove Hartley Charles Demuth Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock are in this show. The contemporary painters are Gregory Amenoff Anna Bialabroda Bill Jensen and Katherine Porter. There are three sculptors as well but they only blunt further the point the show makes.The contrast between the earlier and the contemporary American artists is instructive. With Dove Krasner and Pollock the earth was so much in their blood that they did not have to worry about it being in their work. As long as their painting reflected their deepest thoughts and feelings the earth would be there. The younger artists are approaching landscape after all the years when progressive art rejected it and they are far more wary and removed. Amenoff calls attention to the movement and texture of the paint itself. In Porter's work landscape imagery and urban sophistication seem almost to be pitted against each other. Only in Jensen's painting do the abstract elements become a way of tapping the full force of the natural world. (Through tomorrow.)''From Organism to Architecture'' (New York Studio School 8 West Eighth Street): In order to get anything out of this show it is necessary to forget its title. ''From Organism to Architecture'' immediately suggests to me that evolution from organic form to architectural structure that took place in the work of Mondrian and Kandinsky. Although a dialogue between geometric structure and organic form generally seems to be the subject of the show this dialogue is still so widespread that the selections could only be extremely arbitrary. Only the organizer the painter Ross Bleckner knows for sure. It was certainly impossible for this visitor to tell what he was trying to say from his babbling accompanying statement.As long as no one is looking for a coherent argument or a historical perspective the show has something to say. It makes the point that the tension and dialogue between organic and architectural are continuing and it focuses attention on scale. Iris Mitchell's four paintings could only work at their almost miniature scale. The same is true of the 10 small and very diverse paintings by the late Victor Alzamora that are the heart of the show. The effectiveness of these works has an instructive effect on the other mostly larger works making many of them looser and more overblown than they would appear to be on their own. The painting by Cy Twombly neatly fits the title of the show and looks very good. So does the finely constructed portrait by Max Beckmann. But what this portrait is doing in the show is anybody's guess. (Through March 15.)

9,This policy is also making for some testy competition between Americans and Kenyans in United States road racing long the model for events worldwide. ''It is moving in that direction'' said LeMay 29 who works as a computer engineer because he cannot afford to run full time. ''The competition on the roads is overwhelming. At Falmouth I was getting swamped. After a certain point you just say to yourself 'I hope I can be the first American.' ''Certainly the United States is not quite the land of opportunity it once was for Kenyan runners who for years have flocked to road races here. When based here Kamau 25 lives with five other Kenyan runners in Norristown Pa. a suburb of Philadelphia. Kamau is married with two children and owns a modest farm in the central Kenyan village of Muranga but running is his ticket to prosperity as it is for other Kenyans.''The problem is that at some races the money only goes to Americans'' Kamau said. ''These races have lost their fame. A big race is when the competition is stiff and everyone has an equal chance to fight for the prize.''The largess for Americans is distributed in several ways. At Falmouth there were two prize structures one for overall finish and one for Americans enabling the 30th-place man an American to win the same $400 as the eighth-place man a Kenyan. At the 13 races for men and 11 for women this year on the USA Running Circuit most of the $250000 prize money is for Americans only effectively shutting out foreign opposition.A third system will be used by the New York City Marathon which offers bonuses to Americans but only if they finish high in the overall standings. If an American places third he or she would pocket $20000 as opposed to $10000 for foreigners. First place is worth $30000 but for Americans it is more than tripled to $100000. Winners also receive an automobile.''We're trying to encourage Americans to shoot for the grand prize'' said the marathon director Allan Steinfeld.An American man has as much chance of winning this year's New York City Marathon as the Jets have of winning the Super Bowl. The New York field is led by the three-time Boston Marathon winner Cosmas Ndeti and this year's Boston winner Moses Tanui both from Kenya. The leading American male entered is the unheralded 33-year-old Alfredo Vigueras of San Antonio.

1,The Civil War tale “Amelia” revolves around the adventures of its feisty title character culminating in her disguising herself as a man to find her husband in the Camp Sumter military prison in Andersonville Ga.But the play’s true chameleon is its writer Alex Webb who portrays all of the characters opposite Amelia (Shirleyann Kaladjian). For 95 minutes Mr. Webb moves among genders races ages and cultures his physicality and voice shifting fluidly as he goes. Soon enough the sunken Powder Magazine space in Fort Jay on Governors Island where “Amelia” is being staged thrums with a cast of ghostly personae.PhotoGovernors Island which held imprisoned Confederate soldiers during the war is an evocative site (it’s great fun to attend on a Thursday or Friday afternoon when the island is not otherwise open to the public). But the play directed by Bill Largess is a routine affair depicting a storybook romance between the strong-willed Amelia and the enlightened Ethan who volunteers for service with the Pennsylvania troops shortly after the two fall in love.Ethan of course is too good to be true. He has the right politics (pro-Abraham Lincoln antislavery) and delights in talking about it with — and better yet listening to — smart women. The ever-prickly ready-to-be-insulted Amelia has found her soul mate and eventually she sets out after her man not knowing whether he has been captured wounded or killed. (It’s something like “Cold Mountain” in reverse.)Mr. Webb who wrote “Amelia” after reading a reference in an Andersonville prison journal to a woman’s having sneaked inside tries to render the sweeping drama of the Civil War on an intimate human scale. But his language isn’t up to the task.Amelia especially is far too clichéd to be a sympathetic heroine; her pursuit seems myopically self-centered and foolhardy instead of brave (a scene in which a black man in search of his own family lends her his help after Amelia has equated her pain with his is particularly eye-roll inducing). Though it’s a pleasure to watch Mr. Webb morph from one role to the next the play’s center remains one-dimensional and static.

8,Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth yesterday suspended for one year Keith Hernandez of the Mets Dale Berra of the Yankees and five other major league players for cocaine use. However Mr. Ueberroth offered to lift the suspensions if the players agreed to certain conditions including contributing 10 percent of their salaries this year to programs to combat drug abuse and submitting to drug tests for the remainder of their careers.Four other players were suspended for 60 days with the bans to be lifted if they give 5 percent of their salaries to drug programs and agree to testing.The commissioner also said he would require 10 other players to undergo testing for the remainder of their careers because of past use of cocaine. These 10 are not to be penalized. Reason for Suspensions Any of the players involved who have positive tests for cocaine marijuana morphine or heroin would automatically be subject to the suspension Mr. Ueberroth said. Similarly those who refuse to be tested would be subject to the suspensions which would be effective opening day. Those suspended would not be paid.The one-year suspensions were handed out to those players who Mr. Ueberroth said had not only used drugs themselves but had also ''in some fashion facilitated the distribution of drugs in baseball.'' He said these players had shared drugs with teammates and in some cases introduced players to drug dealers.
0,Although it bears the title ''Two Women'' Tahmine Milani's film is really about one. And her name is legion.While ''Two Women'' is set in Iran the suffering woman at its compassionate heart may be found wherever those like her are denied a right to education and work are oppressed and abused by husbands are stalked by violent obsessive men and are denied recourse in court.''I am a human being!'' she cries in despair at one point. But almost no one seems to care.Ms. Milani's impressive unsettling deeply felt film about a brilliant young woman trapped and reduced to hopelessness in a society that accords her no right to equality is said to have proved a sensation when released last year in Iran. ''Two Women'' may be seen at tonight and tomorrow in the 29th New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art.The women of the title are Fereshteh and Roya who meet as university students in Tehran and become fast friends in the tumultuous period of the Iranian revolution of the late 1970's when factions dedicated to the clerical forces of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini clashed with westernized intellectuals and liberals on campuses.

1,PhotoScientists have turned up ample evidence that consumption of seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids may help protect against cardiovascular disease. But the data have usually been indirect gleaned from food questionnaires used to estimate consumption.But now a new analysis relying on blood tests and years of clinical exams confirms that higher blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk for heart disease and death in people over age 65.The blood tests were used to track the levels of three different types of omega-3 in 2692 randomly selected people average age 74 at the start of the study for 14 years. All were generally healthy and without previous heart disease. None used fish oil supplements.The study was published online Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.There were 1625 deaths over the 14-year study period. The highest blood levels of the three kinds of omega-3 individually and combined were associated with the lowest total mortality and there was a dose-response relationship — that is as blood levels of omega-3 went up the risk for death declined.After adjustment for a number of variables those in the highest 20 percent in omega-3 blood levels were 27 percent less likely to die of any cause than those in the lowest fifth. Those with blood levels in the highest fifth were also 40 percent less likely to die of coronary heart disease and 48 percent less likely to die of an arrhythmia than those in the lowest fifth.There were fewer deaths from stroke in those with the highest levels of omega-3s but the difference was not statistically significant. Over all the researchers calculated that those with the highest omega-3 blood levels lived an average of 2.22 more years than those with lowest.The lead author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian an associate professor of medicine at Harvard said that the most beneficial levels could be achieved by consuming an average of 400 milligrams of omega-3s a day — the equivalent of weekly consumption of about 3.5 ounces of farmed salmon 5 ounces of anchovies or herring or 15 to 18 ounces of cod or catfish.While greater amounts may have some additional benefits he said “The most bang for the buck is going from zero to some.”Controlled trials have shown that omega-3 fatty acids have various beneficial physiological effects among them reduced heart rate lower blood pressure and lower triglyceride production. These effects are modest the researchers say but combined they could reduce mortality.Dr. Kenneth J. Mukamal an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard who was not involved in the study said the work confirmed “older clinical trials showing just this — that omega-3 oil prevented sudden cardiac death.”The finding that omega-3 levels were associated with lowered risk for death by specific causes Dr. Mozaffarian said is novel and important.“The specificity for heart disease and arrhythmias is very compelling for this being a cause-and-effect relationship” he said rather than an association based on general good health or other lifestyle factors.Still the authors acknowledge that there may be other variables they were unable to account for.Would omega-3 supplements work just as well as eating fish? “Some previous trials of supplements showed benefits” Dr. Mozaffarian said. “Some more recent have not. So I think it’s a little uncertain what’s going on.”In any case he said supplements may be the answer for some people: “If you don’t eat fish take supplements and if you want to take supplements in addition to eating fish no harm in doing that.”

9,Youth is life's period of resistance if not revolt so it was not surprising to see that Saturday evening's large crowd at the Washington Square Church was predominantly made up of young people. They came to hear the vocal music of North India as practiced by Pandit Jasraj and Swapan Chaudhuri. Mr. Jasraj is a singer of great range but is perhaps most powerful in his bass and baritone range. Mr. Chaudhuri plays the tabla.What music could be more in opposition to ours? The European tradition is obsessed with beginnings and endings a sense of temporal finiteness carved out of infinity. In this Indian vocal tradition however music starts and ends when it pleases though at the same time confining itself to the most rigidly channeled use of given designs.This obeisance to the notes of a specific scale and their co-relatives is the kind of restriction that would stifle Westerners for whom modulations and harmonic development have become major avenues of expression. Indian music seeks freedom in its self-imposed stasis while the European-American composer finds it in restlessness and exploration.Mr. Jasraj provides powerful evidence that the barriers set up by these age-old sequential patterns ornamental conventions and set scales are in the long run illusory. The implication is that the liberation of musical ideas lies in the microcosm and not beyond the next frontier.
8,What I would like to do is borrow the beam for a week during the testing phase before it is being used for power on earth and send that beam out to the nearest star system. And in the beam I would place Starwisp a very fine mesh of wires a mile across weighing less than an ounce. The microwaves would bounce off this mesh and give it a push toward the nearest star. It would accelerate very rapidly and it would reach 20 percent of the speed of light in a week long before it left the solar system.It would then coast to the nearest star. We now have a flying sail of chicken wire.As it approached the nearest star system Alpha Centauri by then we would have turned on the microwave beam again - of course we would have to remember to turn out the beam four years earlier to get it there in time. We would enough microwave energy to power microcircuits in the wire mesh designed to put together a picture of the planets in the star system.We will receive four years later pictures of television quality in color of the Alpha Centauri system as Starwisp flies through it. JAMES POWELL -WHERE TO GET FUEL FOR STARSHIPS Interstellar flight does appear feasible though difficult at speeds maybe up to 10 to 20 percent the speed of light. If you want the energy to do this you're going to need planetary scale robotic operations and one is optimistic that the technology could be available by the end of the 21st century.Where do we get that kind of energy? Obviously we don't want to use up all of the energy we produce now on earth. To try to turn it into the amount we would need for a starship is impractical. There are some possibilities with large-scale planetary-type energy farms. One is solar factories on or in the orbit of Mercury; another is to do what the British group recommended doing which was mining helium 3 in Jupiter. There's probably a very large supply of it there. And that doesn't look too technically difficult. ISAAC ASIMOV -YES BUT SOCIETY WON'T PAY FOR IT Remember it's the scientists and the astronauts who have the fun of designing and the fun of flying but it's people who are going to be paying for this. If you're going to start building sails that are 1000 kilometers across or building sources of power that make use of respectable fractions of the earth's annual output or anything of that sort it's going to cost quite a bit of money and people if they're going to spend that money want to feel that they personally are going to get the use out of it. If you tell them here we are going to spend a trillion dollars and we're going to send somebody off and your great-grandchildren are going to get news of it they're going to think of other things they can spend their trillion dollars on.For one reason or another it may turn out that it won't be safe or practical to travel at more than an average speed of a tenth the speed of light two-tenths at the most so that it might take something like 40 years to reach Alpha Centauri and 40 years to come back. And I don't think that we're going to talk Earth's society into agreeing to such a trip. What does that mean? That interstellar flight is impossible? No because I don't expect society to stay the way it is now. I expect it to change. It's got to change if we are going to explore the solar system.So far we've had a great deal of trouble expanding into space. We've been pretty successful but we've been at the ragged edge all the time. NASA has never had as much money as it needs. It has always had to cut corners. People are always a little disappointed that it's not all over yet. We reached the moon didn't we? What else do we want? We're always glad to do things if they're reasonably cheap and if they bring back obvious benefits.

0,TAMPA Fla. Jan. 1 — Joe Paterno stepped gingerly onto the sideline at Raymond James Stadium this morning his cane firmly in hand as a Penn State staffer security and cameras hovered. It was a significant milestone in Paterno’s recovery from a broken left leg and torn ligaments on Nov. 4 when he was run over on the sideline by two players during a game at Wisconsin. Finally Paterno was back on the field.He did not stay very long. Paterno who turned 80 on Dec. 21 stood for eight minutes before slowly making his way back to the tunnel during pregame warmups and then up to the press box. He was still too fragile and immobile to risk another hit coaching the Nittany Lions against Tennessee in the Outback Bowl.Instead Paterno watched from above along with 65601 fans as a defensive battle turned on an 88-yard fumble return by Penn State cornerback Tony Davis with 10 minutes 1 second remaining to lift the Nittany Lions to a 20-10 victory against No. 17 Tennessee. It as the 22nd bowl victory of Paterno’s career and his team finished the season 9-4.The fumble return happened one play after a 53-yard pass from Tennessee quarterback Erik Ainge nephew of the Boston Celtics executive Danny Ainge to tight end Chris Brown gave the Volunteers (9-4) a first down on the Penn State 14-yard line — Tennessee’s best scoring opportunity of a lean second half.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Vols appeared on their way to breaking a 10-10 tie. But linebacker Sean Lee punched the ball out of running back Arian Foster’s arms on the next play and Davis picked up the ball and sprinted down the sideline for the touchdown that put Penn State in control.

8,Out in the breeze and sunshine on Court 16 the man who had suffered the worst Grand Slam defeat in his storied career just the night before within the gloom of the cavernous Stadium Court contemplated a shot and doubled up in a convulsion of laughter.There's nothing John McEnroe said later like a change of scenery.Yesterday the cast of characters who came and went on Court 16 the intimate 4100-seat tree-framed arena at this unintimate concrete facility read like a soap opera.First there was Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the little tugboat of a player who bested Steffi Graf at the French Open and became Spain's first tennis heroine since Lili Alvarez went to the final at Wimbledon in 1928. Sanchez Vicario the Open's sixth seed made expeditious work of Cammy MacGregor 6-1 6-3 and made no secret of the fact that she envisions a second Grand Slam title for herself. Life at the EdgeFor the chatty Sanchez Vicario mistress of five languages and a devastating drop shot ''Everything is superfine.''

9,After 23 years on the Supreme Court bench Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun stepped down today in a simple court ceremony.Moments after the Justices issued the term's final six decisions two of which were written by Justice Blackmun Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist read a brief letter from all the Court members paying tribute to their retiring colleague.But the letter included a remark that some in the courtroom saw as double edged. The Chief Justice referred to a Blackmun opinion he has criticized the one establishing the constitutional right to an abortion saying: "Your opinions have covered a wide range of the issues that come before the Court. You are undoubtedly best known for having authored the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade in 1973 but that distinction should not obscure the many other important issues on which you have spoken for the Court."Justice Blackmun who is planning to move to Jacksonville Fla. although he will maintain an office here responded by quoting the retirement letter of Justice William O. Douglas who compared serving with his colleagues to being an outdoorsman with its "occasional long and strenuous portages and the last night's and the last morning's campfires."

9,A baseball career can create a fantasylike effect on a man's life but reality has intruded on Keith Hernandez's. One more disabling injury he said and his career is over.''The injuries affect me a lot'' the Cleveland Indians' new first baseman said last week. ''I've had two interrupted years where I couldn't get anything going. I don't know if I have another season in me that will be injury-free the rest of my career whether it's one year or five years. If I get hurt again this year I quit. It'll be my last year. I'm not going to go through another year like that. I'd be turning down a lot of money but I'm not going through another year like the last two I've had. It's miserable.''With the Mets last year Hernandez suffered a broken kneecap when it was struck by a thrown ball. The year before he had hamstring problems. The combination limited him to 170 games after he had played 149 games or more in each of 10 successive seasons (except the strike year of 1981).''It's very frustrating'' he said. ''There's always a question in your mind well if I would have a full year could I still do it. That's why I want to play; I want to find out. But if I have another year where I'm hurt that's it.''

8,The sales tax in Suffolk County will increase a quarter of a percentage point Saturday from 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent.As a result an extra penny of tax will be added to every $4 worth of goods or services purchased in the county.The increase was approved by the County Legislature in September to help bail out the Southwest Sewer District and to avoid a doubling of sewer taxes for Islip and Babylon residents who live in the district.William Brotherton the deputy county executive in charge of finance said that most of the tax increase would be spent in the sewer district for the first two years. But he said that over the five-year life of the tax increase nearly 40 percent of the $115 million he expects it to yield would be spent in other sewer districts to lower tax rates.

9,Holtz makes his case for recalling the 1989 season when Miami won the championship over Notre Dame which finished second. Although the two teams had the same record and both won their bowl games the strongest argument in favor of Miami was that the Hurricanes had defeated the Irish in a head-to-head meeting.Nothing else but that game was really relevant Holtz recalled including what he thought was Notre Dame's tougher schedule and the fact that the Irish beat Colorado the top-rated team in the Orange Bowl. Ergo should this year's calculation resemble that of four years ago Notre Dame should get the decision Holtz said."If nobody's undefeated then you say O.K. the No. 1 tie breaker in everything I know is match play" Holtz said. "The N.F.L. does it this way. The college conferences do it this way. And they did it in '89. So I don't know. All I'm worried about is finding a way to beat A&M." On Natural TurfHe spoke early today at the Cotton Bowl where his players went through a light workout on the newly installed natural turf.The natural turf was installed this year in preparation for next summer's World Cup soccer tournament. The playing surface should favor Notre Dame which plays on a similar surface at home. Texas A&M plays on artificial turf. Pieces of the old plastic sod were mounted on plaques and given to Holtz and to R. C. Slocum the A&M coach earlier this week as mementos.Although the game has a possible impact on the national title its tickets aren't the hot items they once were here in what some call the capital state of football. Seats are available. Rick Baker executive director of the game said today "we'll have a crowd of 71000." Capacity is 71456.Part of the problem could be that the game is not only a rematch of last year's one-sided Notre Dame victory it is the third consecutive appearance by an Aggie team that has lost the previous two. Another new wrinkle is the time of the kickoff. It will be 4:40 p.m. Eastern time and it will be televised by NBC opposite the Rose Bowl on ABC. The weather forecast calls for partly cloudy skies strong breezes and temperatures in the low 60's.

8,Ever so quietly senior officials of the International Olympic Committee are still working on resolving the issue of North Korea's participation in the Seoul Olympics later this year.At a recent state dinner in Madrid Juan Antonio Samaranch the I.O.C. president spoke privately with Eduard A. Shevardnadze the Soviet Foreign Minister to review the I.O.C.'s position and to seek any help the Soviet Union might offer in persuading North Korea to attend the games.In June the I.O.C. offered the North Koreans five events to stage. Last month Pyongyang responded by saying North Korea would not participate in the Games unless it was made a co-host with South Korea. North Korea thus became one of 6 of the 167 nations to respond negatively to the I.O.C.'s invitation to take part in the Summer Games.A source familar with Samaranch's conversation with Shevardnadze said the Foreign Minister seemed surprised to hear that North Korea would not take the I.O.C. offer.

9,Stores that do a lot of their own private-label business in Asia have also benefited from the region's woes although in many cases any gains are offset by the instability of suppliers some of whom may not stay afloat. And Asian suppliers who buy their raw materials outside their country are being hammered by the currency ills raising their costs.But the savings to consumers are clearly beginning to trickle in. ''We expect to receive price concessions from our existing overseas manufacturers allowing us to pass on savings to our customers'' said Terry J. Lundgren president of Federated Department Stores Inc.'s merchandising unit. Federated owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's as well as other department store chains.In the consumer electronics business which has also shown modest price decreases retailers say that most of the price cuts are in products that have simply lost value with age. Nintendo 64 for example sold for $249 at Toys ''R'' Us when it first came out; it can now be purchased for half that price.The Import Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that prices of imported toys and various other electronic goods fell last month. Indeed between March 1997 and March 1998 import prices of consumer goods (excluding autos) fell nine-tenths of a percent. ''There is a strong correlation between price deflation and deflation in import prices'' said Edward Yardeni an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York.In some cases while prices may not be falling retailers are trying to beef up what they are getting for their money. ''There are some opportunities for lower costs'' said Susan Eich a spokeswoman for the Dayton Hudson Corporation ''and we are using that to improve and upgrade quality.'' Some furniture sold at the company's Target discount stores for instance will now have extra features for the same price she said.Of course retailers especially of things like computers and televisions where margins are razor thin would love to bolster their balance sheets with these savings. But with rare exception this will not be possible.Most of the savings are occurring among routine commodity items where competition is stiff and price is the main draw. ''Retailers are so competitive'' Mr. Glassman said ''that if one company gives consumers an edge everyone else is forced to do it.''
9,To the Editor:Kenneth W. Starr's choices in granting immunity reveal his true aim: to embarrass the President (front page July 29).Monica S. Lewinsky has been granted immunity from prosecution for a possible charge of lying under oath in order to trap the President on just such a charge. I can't see the logic in granting immunity to one person in order to prosecute another for the same crime. However if Mr. Starr's motives are not to see that justice is done but rather to skewer President Clinton then the logic is clear.ROBERT RESNIKOFFCroton-on-Hudson N.Y. July 30 1998
8,The camera work of both the Summer and Winter Olympics was invariably beautiful or exciting or dramatic and sometimes all three from the kaleidoscopic multitude of oars flashing in the rowing races to Gabriela Andersen-Schiess's staggering into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on the last leg of the women's marathon.From the broadcasting booths ABC sought at first to make the Summer Olympics not just a great sports carnival but an American sports triumph (something it couldn't do in Sarajevo because the United States squad was not dominant). The network figured that this would sell but the blatant cheerleading and the unprofessionalism antagonized many even a good number of naturally partisan Americans.Juan Antonio Samaranch president of the International Olympic Committee sent a letter of formal complaint about ABC's coverage to the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee and its head Peter Ueberroth. Next Roone Arledge directing the network's Olympic coverage was apprised of it and he reacted. The brassy boosterism was toned down and with no discernible drop in viewing pleasure.And what it followed is the appropriate role of the commentator on a televised sports event? Well he should bring to the microphone a sense of showmanship certainly but also a sense of journalistic propriety of maintaining perspective.Above all we ask that our intelligence not be insulted. We want to be given captions to what we're seeing. Much of the story is unfolding before our eyes and so we need not be told too much. And the announcer no matter who he is is not the show. We tune in for the event and not the commentator a point of which some commentators are not aware. The caption notion was true during the Olympics a special event and it is true on regular sports shows.In the ratings two weeks ago for example thefinal ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast of theseason was the second-ranked show of the week behind only ''Dynasty.'' The game matched two attractive teams - the Dolphins and the Cowboys - and was of great interest to fans following the National Football League's playoff possibilities.In the last few months there has been some scratching of heads about the diminishing ratings of pro football on television - and of ''Monday Night Football'' in particular especially since Howard Cosell who had been in the booth since the program began in 1970 had taken his leave. A question was raised: Is ''Monday Night Football'' fading because Cosell is gone?Answer according to the recent ratings: No.Provide a game of interest and the fans will tune in.The sports event as drama whether it be a football game or an Olympic race remains the story.
1,When Amazon announced last week that it was buying the online pharmacy PillPack it sent stocks of drugstore companies like Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbling as investors worried that the retail behemoth would soon upend the pharmacy market.But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers it may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That’s because to succeed it will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well.As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenues PillPack most likely didn’t attract much attention from the pharmacy industry’s giants said Eric Percher an equity research analyst at Nephron Research.“I think they have absolutely been able to fly under the radar” he said. But now that a household name like Amazon is buying the company “the entities that have enabled PillPack’s success — whether they knew it or not — have a decision to make” he said.

0,Most of the natural sea salts introduced in the last few years have about the same effect on your food. But texture is a factor and can influence the amount you use. The latest exotic salts are from Asia: Bali Bangladesh and the Himalayas from ancient marine deposits left in the foothills.Two years ago Ben and Blair Ripple American entrepreneurs started Big Tree Farms a cottage industry in Bali that employs local families to extract sea salt above from the black sand beaches. The coarsest of the grains are actually hollow and shaped like pyramids; they have an almost sweet finish. These salts are sold at Dean & DeLuca in 5-ounce boxes for $6.50 and in 10-ounce coconut shells for $14. Kalustyan's has Bay of Bengal sea salt which is coarse rustically uneven and a bargain at $8 a pound. Himalania is a sharp-tasting pink salt from the Himalayas finely milled in France packed with a wooden spoon in 8.75-ounce boxes and sold at Grace's Marketplace $11 and Sur la Table $11.95.
9,Elmer K. Timby an engineer who worked on major projects like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge in New York died on Wednesday at St. Mary Hospital in Langhorne Pa. He was 86 years old and lived in Newtown Pa.He died of pneumonia his wife said.For 21 years Mr. Timby taught civil engineering at Princeton University and retired as chairman of the department in 1949. From 1950 to 1968 he worked for Howard Needles Tammen & Bergendoff a national engineering firm as a partner and president of its international subsidiary.Besides the famous bridges on both coasts he helped design and build the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge the New Jersey Turnpike the West Virginia Turnpike the Delaware Memorial Bridge Miami International Airport and the Hampton Roads Tunnel-Bridge Highway Crossing in Virginia. Mr. Timby was also a consultant to Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island.Among his innovations was building elaborate working metal models of bridges and other structures to study stress problems and to modify the designs. One model of a floating structure for the Navy had a 150000 parts and in 1936 was described as the most complicated structural model ever assembled.

8,Broadly speaking the growth of labor-intensive imports is not only inevitable but also desirable. Rising living standards have always depended on the ever more productive use of labor. Work by Americans that could be done as well but much more cheaply by Taiwanese or Turks represents historically a drag on the American economy. Moreover the United States has a major foreign policy interest in cheap manufacture abroad. The growth and stability of developing economies - and their demand for American-made goods - depends on their exports of low-wage products.Thanks to its flexible free-market system America continues to create jobs as rapidly as they are destroyed by changing world market conditions. Virtually everyone who is put out of work by imports eventually finds other employment. For clothing workers who earn $5 or $6 an hour the chances are that new jobs will pay as well or better.But these abstractions are no comfort for the workers and communities that depend on garment making. If Americans want to continue to benefit from cheap imports we must accept responsibility for what happens to these people and places. Congress tried in the 1970's by offering supplementary unemployment benefits for workers dislocated by imports. But this worthy first try was quickly labeled ''burial insurance'' by union leaders. The program inadequate though it was has been allowed to lapse.A better remedy in keeping with free-market principles would be to get serious about re-employing the dislocated and subsidizing their relocation. The Federal Government has never attempted systematically to match blue-collar workers with jobs in other regions the way white-collar workers are now routinely served by private employment agencies. Nor has Washington ever offered to help with moving expenses or tried to encourage relocation by retailing information about schools and housing. Nor has it ever made an intelligent enduring effort to teach new skills to those whose experience is no longer in demand.A prudent and humane society should neither resist desirable change nor cast aside its victims. American industry has always been on the move. New England was thrice transformed from dependence on farming fishing and commerce to shoe and textile manufacture to education high tech and insurance. We need such vital change to remain prosperous. It would be foolish to cement so many jobs into place in every town or state. But it is cruel and ultimately untenable to turn a deaf ear to those who need help in moving with the tides.

0,Last fall the racial skew in expulsion rates became a national issue after six black students in Decatur Ill. were expelled following a brawl in the bleachers at a high school football game and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's Rainbow/Operation PUSH Coalition filed a civil-rights lawsuit. The case was dismissed and the expulsions upheld but the testimony showed that blacks accounted for more than 80 percent of the district's expulsions over the last four years even though they make up less than half of the student body.That kind of racial skew is common in several aspects of education the study found. In all nine districts that provided statistics on academic placement by race the study found white students were disproportionately represented in advanced placement and gifted programs and minority students underrepresented.In San Francisco the study found that blacks and Latinos make up 42 percent of the student body but only 14 percent of those in advanced placement and gifted programs. And in Durham N.C. where blacks and Latinos make up 62 percent of the students they represent only 27 percent of the students in academically advanced classes. While few of the districts studied had large Asian-American populations the Asian-American students in most districts were overrepresented in advanced classes and underrepresented among those who were disciplined.The study asserts that the disparities amount to ''a deep pattern of institutional racism.'' But many education experts took issue with that conclusion. While the inequalities described in the study are distressing they say those differences like the well-documented racial gap on test scores do not necessarily add up to institutional racism.''Unfortunately we have a lot of history and evidence that schools tend to reproduce the economic and social disparities of the larger society'' said Robert B. Schwartz president of Achieve a school reform group made up of governors and corporate executives. ''We look to schooling to be this great equalizing engine but history hasn't been terrific on that score. Can one deny that racism persists? Of course not. But I think it's more complicated than racism alone. Obviously class plays into this and other factors.''

9,Norris Embry Snyder Fine Art 20 West 57th Street Manhattan Through Dec. 9As an artist Norris Embry was somewhere between an insider and an outsider. Born in Louisville Ky. trained in art school (he studied with Kokoschka no less) he exhibited in galleries and museums in New York until his death in 1980 at 59 so he was not an outsider in that sense. But his works were also an expression of his schizophrenia and his mental illness links him to outsider art.The works are wild raucous paintings and collages made up of newspaper clippings and obscure diaristic writings combined with looming faces random shapes and doodles. Sometimes the works just collapse into headlong chaos. Mostly there was method to Embry's madness. The colors are refulgent purples blues and reds and the images have an almost incantatory quality in their obsessive layered construction. Above all they seem genuine which means they can make you cringe at their anguish at the same time that they win you over through their exuberance and apparent faith in the exorcistic potential of art. Clearly art for Embry was a profound release. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

1,PhotoNEWS To the growing outrage of international conservation groups and the embarrassment of Chinese law enforcement agencies the international ivory trade is booming with much of the smuggled ivory ending up as statuary and jewelry in Chinese showrooms and private collections. Critics say the Chinese government is not doing enough to stem the illicit ivory trade which has exploded in the five years since conservationists and governments agreed to a program of limited ivory sales intended to stifle poaching and revive a centuries-old handicraft. In the past year more than 32000 elephants have been illegally killed according to the Born Free Foundation a wildlife organization and conservationists say the vast majority of ivory sold in China is of questionable origin.

1,Richard Perry/The New York TimesTHURSDAY’S PUZZLE — I don’t remember the last time I saw a quip theme in a New York Times puzzle mostly because Will Shortz generally doesn’t run them. Today however he makes an exception for Stu Ockman who is also making his debut. I asked Mr. Shortz why quip themes run so rarely and he responded:“Generally speaking quip themes are not as interesting as more traditional themes because they give the solver only one “Aha!” (usually at the end) whereas a traditional theme provides a little punch with each entry. Therefore for a quip or quote theme to be worth devoting an entire puzzle to the “Aha!” needs to be really big such as by being very funny or very interesting. Most quips and quotes just don’t have that big a punch. Also it’s really hard to get quips and quotes that appeal to a broad range of solvers. A quip that’s funny to one solver probably won’t be funny to someone else. I think quip and quote themes are worth running once in a while as with [Mr. Ockman’s] puzzle for variety’s sake — just not too often.”Mr. Ockman quotes the philosopher Confucius in his grid and I personally couldn’t agree more with the quote. We learn many things in life — especially from crossword puzzles am I right? — but the older we get it seems the more we realize how little we actually know. Don’t even get me started on trying to remember where I put my car keys.I was surprised to see that the nice long Down 15s — IN ALL LIKELIHOOD and BEETHOVEN’S NINTH — were not first-timers and I wasn’t partial to the partial A LET at 61 Across. I’m not even sure what a let really is in tennis and I sure didn’t like it as a partial fill-in-the-blank.All in all however this was a nice debut.Some parents in China are embracing the return of Confucian philosophy as a means of educating their children:But you knew I’d have to include this as well even though Confucius was thoughtlessly left out:Let’s meet Mr. Ockman:Constructor’s NotesIf I don’t succeed in embarrassing myself with my first puzzle (be gentle Rex) I’ll surely succeed with these constructor notes. I’m a civil engineer in real life and I’ve always found constructing things to be an enjoyable challenge. I started solving crossword puzzles in sixth grade and New York Times crosswords a year later. So when Adam Perl a longtime friend and college classmate mentioned that his crossword would be in The New York Times on Thursday (at the very end of a long phone call) I started to research crossword construction on the Web. Soon armed with a trial version of Crossword Compiler I submitted my first puzzle to Will on Christmas Day 2010. And the rest is history! In case you’re still reading that particular puzzle has never appeared in The New York Times. But I’ve learned a lot from Will’s suggestions and Adam is the best crossword mentor in upstate New York (it was Adam’s 16th New York Times crossword). Thanks Will and especially thanks Adam! I couldn’t have done it without you two. In my first dozen puzzles I tried three with what I thought were great quotes. “They have miscalculated me as a leader” a George W. Bush malapropism sadly (depending on your political point of view) did not make the cut. “I made a killing on Wall Street a few years ago. shot my broker” by Groucho Marx was rejected with a note that The New York Times almost never runs quip-themed puzzles. Finally scouring the Internet for suitable material I stumbled on the Confucius quote featured in tomorrow’s puzzle. Hope you enjoy it.Your thoughts?

Ms. Warren said she was forming a presidential exploratory committee which allows her to raise money and hire staff before a formal kickoff.• Ms. Warren’s announcement marks the beginning of a new year and new campaign that will feature an unusually large number of Democrats seeking the presidency.

He was one of our best: worldly erudite accomplished and fully dedicated to his clients. He bridged cultures in international finance and enriched the lives of those he touched. He lived a remarkable life: born in Germany; fighting for the British in World War II; and moving to the U.S. where he would pioneer the field of international investing while cultivating deep and broad passions for history the arts and global affairs. In retirement he remained a vibrant presence at Lazard and in society serving not-for-profit organizations in the arts education and public policy.

9,Iraq has very little money to pay war reparations and had overdue debts to many creditors even before it invaded Kuwait current and former United States Government officials and other experts say.The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Oct. 29 that made Iraq liable for war damage and losses suffered by Kuwait and other countries. When President Bush specified Wednesday the allies' conditions for a permanent cease-fire he included Baghdad's "acceptance in principle of Iraq's responsibility to pay compensation for the loss damage and injury its aggression has caused."Iraq said Wednesday that it would comply with all 12 resolutions.But forcing Iraq to pay reparations will be difficult given its lack of money and will conflict with other American interests said Richard W. Murphy a former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. Empty Coffers Influence WarIraq's near-empty treasury has been a cause of the war and an obstacle to its conclusion.On Feb. 15 when Iraq first said it would consider negotiating a withdrawal one condition was the cancellation of its foreign debts and thoseof neighbors who had not assisted the allied war effort.

9,''Twenty-five thousand a seat?'' said Larry Gelbart who wrote the book for the show with Bert Shevelove. ''The original production cost $275000. That's 11 seats for tonight.'' Mr. Gelbart said he thought the show a slapstick ribald riff on the value of freedom (and in a way monogamy) was more suitable for the Democrats than the Republicans and particularly suitable for this President. ''When the show first was on in 1963 Time magazine called it 'a good clean dirty show' '' he said. ''I think he enjoys a good clean dirty show.''Intermission was omitted and some other cuts were made on the two-and-a-quarter hour show to accommodate the President's schedule. ''We got it down to about one hour 35 minutes'' Ms. Kelley said ''not including ad libs.'' And of course there were some. ''Ooh kiss me somebody kiss me'' Ms. Goldberg cried at one point in the midst of an aphrodisiac-induced fit then stopped in mid-gyration to blow an exaggerated kiss at the special guest in the front row. And as she usually does at the start of the show Ms. Goldberg broke character and chastised a latecomer from the stage. ''Any other night we would have waited for you but we got the Prez'' she said. ''You get caught in traffic? You can talk to me. This is an interactive show.'' The late arrival responded ''It's the President's fault'' to which Ms. Goldberg shot back ''I ain't touching that one.''Monday is usually a day off for the show and last night's special performance meant that tonight's regularly scheduled one was canceled. Happily no tickets had been sold for tonight by the time the event was arranged mainly because Ms. Goldberg was expected to complete her run as Pseudolus on Sunday and until recently when she agreed to extend her performances through July 13 tickets had been sold only through Sunday.Ms. Goldberg who could not be reached for comment yesterday was instrumental in making sure last night's event happened Ms. Kelley said. ''It's something she wanted to do'' Ms. Kelley said. ''Whoopi is friendly with the President. And he had promised her he'd see the show apparently.''In any case if the special arrangements were a hardship for the cast members and crew who worked last night for the seventh consecutive day no one was complaining. ''The mood at the theater has been pretty excited; come on we're going to meet the President'' said Ross Lehman who plays Hysterium another slave a confidant of Pseudolus who plays a significant portion of the show in drag. ''A lot of people have been doing jokes about how they want to talk to him about their taxes but I don't think I'll bother him with that. I do have a few things to say about foreign affairs.''It was something else that had Mr. Lehman worried though. ''I'm going to be wearing a dress when I meet him'' he said. ''I've been practicing my curtsy.''Ernie Sabella whose character Marcus Lycus according to the program is ''a buyer and seller of courtesans'' but who in plainer lingo runs a brothel seemed less worried about the delicate matter of the President's well-publicized if unproven peccadilloes than about other things. ''I am apprehensive about saying one line'' he said. '' 'I have to go to the senate this morning; I'm blackmailing one of the senators.' I don't know if I'll get a big laugh or if I'll be audited.'' (Uh-oh Mr. Sabella it was only a small titter.)
9,In an interview Mr. Chafee who helped expand Medicaid to reach millions of children and women in the 1980's said: "I don't want to get into a situation where we're reducing the number of people covered. That could happen if Medicaid is no longer an entitlement."Medicaid pays for one out of every three births in the United States finances care for more than a fourth of the country's children and pays for 2 out of every 3 people in nursing homes on any given day. It is much more complex than the main cash assistance program Aid to Families With Dependent Children and costs about six times as much.In the last 10 years Federal spending on Medicaid quadrupled to $82 billion in 1994 and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost will rise an average of more than 10 percent a year in the next five years reaching $148 billion in 2000. Medicaid has become a huge financial burden for the states which must put up their own money to get Federal Medicaid money. On average the states contribute 75 cents for each Federal dollar but those with high per-capita incomes like New York New Jersey and Connecticut must match the Federal contribution dollar for dollar.Representative John R. Kasich the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and Senator Domenici said they had told the governors that they intended to cut Medicaid's current growth rate by half. If the Federal Government held the growth to 5 percent in each of the next five years it would spend $97 billion less than it expects to spend under current law.How could such savings be achieved? Governors and Congressional leaders say more Medicaid recipients must be enrolled in health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. They assume that the Federal Government will reduce or eliminate special payments to hospitals serving disproportionate numbers of indigent patients. But ultimately they say states may have to impose new restrictions on eligibility or cut coverage of some services.James D. Bentley senior vice president of the American Hospital Association said he feared that in negotiating with Congress on block grants each state would "pursue its narrow self-interest saying 'me first' " as it tried to maximize its share of Federal Medicaid money.Seven states have received permission from the Federal Government for statewide experiments to control Medicaid costs or expand eligibility and 10 other states including New York have applied for such waivers. But the state experiments are modest by comparison with the block grants being devised in Congress. None of the state programs eliminate the individual entitlement to Medicaid the bedrock upon which the program has been built for 30 years.
0,In the new church of American finance the first article of faith is progress. More and more goods and services will be produced with fewer and fewer hours of labor world without end.Evidence in support of this belief would appear to be conclusive. First there is the revolution in computer technology. Second there seems to be official affirmation in the national productivity statistics.To compute these statistics the Labor Department divides the volume of our national economic output by the hours worked to create it. In the third and fourth quarters of 1999 the productivity of American nonfarm labor rose at annual rates of 5 percent and 6.4 percent the fastest in years. Expectations are running strong that the next productivity report to be released on Thursday will be just as brilliant.It will be a miracle if it is. If the strength of the recent productivity reports seems unbelievable it is perhaps because they are. James Medoff a Harvard economics professor and Andrew Harless an economic consultant in Needham Mass. have uncovered deep-rooted flaws in the data. Their conclusion is that the numbers were distorted in the melee associated with the run-up to the year 2000. If they are right as it seems apparent they are the ''New Economy'' is about to lose some of its luster.
7,PETRA Jordan Oct. 31 (UPI) —The rose‐red city of Petra an awesome collaboration be tween man and nature is sink ing back into the silence that enveloped it for centuries.Tourists have stopped com ing because of Jordan's wars. Government excavations have been halted for lack of money. One Petra hotel has been closed since the 1967 Mideast war; a second nearby is open but empty. The city is deserted and quiet except for a handful of Bedouin squatters and their sheep.Petra sprawled across a nearly inaccessible ravine at the end of a mile‐long canyon is a triumph of human Imagination and an almost perfectly preserved portrait of a civiliza tion that flourished more than 2000 years ago.The city was founded about 300 B.C. by Nabataean Arabs who grew wealthy on tribute from passing caravans. Later they became traders and em pire‐builders. They traveled widely and brought Greek ar chitecture back to their home.

9,To the Editor:It's depressing to learn that young editors at our top publishers are thinking like the trash tabloids (Buzz: ''Fantasies of Monica Lewinsky: The Book'' Feb. 8). These people will soon be deciding which books get published and which will not make it. On what grounds?Not long ago book publishing attracted graduates who were educated enough to find and promote fine authors and exciting ideas. They were willing to work for less than they could make elsewhere because they had a vision of publishing's importance to society.The Radcliffe Publishing Course graduates would surely smile at such notions as dinosaur behavior that vanished along with standards of quality and integrity. Today as one said: ''There has to be dirt or forget it. No dirt no cash.''SUZANNE KISTLERKips Bay

7,BADEN Austria July 2 —International efforts to link the growing consumer movement with the fight against pollution met a harsh response today from African and Asian na tions.“We are not concerned with pollution but with existence.” Dr. Shankran Kristnamurthy director of the Consumers Council in India said as the International Organization of Consumers Unions broke into a. series of debates in this gar den city 16 miles south of Vienna. “The wealthy countries worry about car fumes. We worry about starvation.”His remarks were echoed even outside the conference hall by delegates of other poor countries who seemed to reflect a growing worldwide concern.In workshops and meetings of the 30‐nation organiza tion which was formed 10 years ago to protect con sumers from high prices and shoddy merchandise delegates from India Ghana Malaysia and other countries bluntly questioned the driving efforts of European and American of ficials here to link the consum er and pollution efforts.
7,WASHINGTON Sept. 1 (UPI) — The Administration today dropped its appeal of a Federal Court ruling last year that struck down a law barring Federal employment of a per son who asserted the right to strike against the Government.The Supreme Court agreed April 27 to rule on the consti tutionality of the law which a special three‐judge court here struck down in November as an abridgment of free speech.The decision came in a case brought by the National As sociation of Letter Carriers against Postmaster General Winton M. Blount several months before the postal work ers’ strike last March.No explanation was given for abandoning the appeal be yond a brief statement from Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold and John W. Karr ttorney for the union that both parties had agreed that the ap peal should be dismissed. The Post Office had no comment.
0,Three weeks into his new job as attorney general Mr. Gonzales said Monday that he had to make "a few adjustments" in moving from President Bush's White House counsel to the official in charge of 110000 employees at the Justice Department. A former enlisted man in the Air Force Mr. Gonzales said one of the more unsettling changes was having employees call him by the title of "general" as they did with Mr. Ashcroft. (He prefers "Judge Gonzales" a nod to his days on the Texas Supreme Court.)While Mr. Gonzales's confirmation as the first Hispanic attorney general buoyed many Hispanics he showed no sign in his remarks on Monday of backing away from the Bush administration's efforts to speed deportation proceedings for illegal immigrants. Under Mr. Ashcroft the Justice Department sought to streamline the process for immigration judges to hear appeals in deportation and asylum cases and Mr. Gonzales said the system was in need of further repair.He said that the Justice Department and federal courts were "straining under the weight of an immigration litigation system that is broken" and that illegal immigrants facing criminal charges were receiving too many chances to appeal their fates. He urged Congress to move quickly on proposals that would expedite the process.But Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee suggested that Mr. Gonzales was misdirecting blame for the immigration backlog."If the attorney general wants to reduce the immigration workload of our federal courts" Mr. Leahy said "he should restore the fair appeals process within the Justice Department that his predecessor diminished through his misguided restructuring of the Board of Immigration Appeals. That and not depriving legal permanent residents of their due process rights should be the solution."

This has de veloped an environmental cli mate enabling hippies to attack with impunity fundamental prin ciples and traditional virtues that made America great.Voters who cherish life lib erty and our right to pursue happiness can make the seven ties sensible.

If that should happen courtesy de cency integrity and responsible society will surely vanish from this earth.
1,How We Got Here
8,Gray-market goods also called ''parallel imports'' are typically trademarked authentic foreign-made products like Nikon cameras and Seiko watches that independent discount retailers buy from overseas suppliers at low prices. The retailers sell them in the United States without the consent of the owners of the American trademarks many of which are distributors affiliated with the foreign manufacturers.In the decision today by two differently constituted 5-to-4 majorities the Court upheld a provision of the Customs Service regulation that allows gray-market imports over the objections of United States trademark owners that are affiliated under common ownership or control with the foreign companies that manufacture the goods.The Court struck down another less significant provision of the regulation affecting cases in which American companies license independent foreign manufacturers to use their trademarks only for sales overseas.Among the winners in the case who persuaded the Court to overturn a Federal appellate ruling that the gray market was illegal were the K Mart Corporation and 47th Street Photo Inc. They sell at discounts trademarked foreign goods that they import through the gray market in competition with the authorized distributors of the foreign manufacturers of those goods.The losers included an association of the United States affilates of foreign companies that seek to use their trademark rights to ban competition from gray market imports of goods sold overseas by the foreign companies as well as some United States manufacturers. One such American company is Duracell Inc. a Kraft Inc. subsidiary that make goods abroad through subsidiaries and sell them both overseas and in the United States.The association called the Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American Trademarks argued unsuccessfully that the gray market and the Customs Service provisions that allow it violated their rights under a 1922 law that they said banned importation of trademarked foreign goods without the consent of the holder of the United States trademark. No Reliable StatisticsGovernment and other experts say there are no reliable statistics on the size of the gray market. Justice William J. Brennan Jr.'s separate opinion called it a ''multibillion-dollar industry'' and an ''immense domestic retail industry.'' Most estimates put it at from $5 billion to $10 billion a year in total sales.
1,Stanley Fish on education law and society.Back in 1963 my brother Ron was going out with (that was the phrase then) an Irish Catholic girl named Ann who was attending the University of Rhode Island. One day she was sitting in class and suddenly through the window she saw my father who it turned out had tracked her down by finding out from the university administration what classes she was taking and at what times. He took her to dinner and then proceeded to tell her that it would ruin his son’s life if he were to marry a non-Jewish girl. He then asked if she would be willing to have no contact with Ron for a year; in return he offered to pay all her expenses during that time. She refused.Meanwhile I had been asked if I could get Ron into the University of California at Berkeley where I was then teaching. (My father as I recall was for this plan and may even have initiated it.) I went to the head of the admissions office and said “My brother has to get out of Rhode Island. Can you admit him here?”“Sure” he said and it was done. (Those were the days; if I tried that in 2013 I would be run out of town.)If the idea was to separate the two young people it didn’t work. Shortly after Ron got to California he sent Ann a plane ticket. When she arrived they got married and have remained married to this day. She got a job at the university took a class in Judaism and much to my brother’s surprise converted although it took her a while to find a rabbi willing to give her the required course of instruction. Just the other day she remarked “It was a hard club to get into.”In 1963 I didn’t know any interfaith couples but things have changed as Naomi Schaefer Riley reports in her new book “’Til Faith Do Us Part: How Interfaith Marriage Is Transforming America.”According to Riley’s research — in 2010 she commissioned a large interfaith marriage survey — the interfaith marriage rate in the United States is 42 percent. The book is chock-full of fascinating statistics (“Jews are the most likely and Mormons are the least likely to marry members of other faiths”) but at its heart is a cautionary thesis: the growing number of interfaith couples don’t know what they’re getting into. “Interfaith couples tend to marry without thinking through the practical implications of their religious differences. They assume that because they are decent and tolerant people … they will not encounter difficulties being married to someone of another faith.”They do however worry about marrying someone whose political views differ from theirs. Riley’s data show that “inter political party marriages are far less common than interfaith marriages.” Why she asks “do Americans seem so much more reluctant to marry outside of their political affiliation than their faith?” and she answers that they may be “unaware or unwilling to acknowledge that religion can be a serious dividing in a marriage.” Because debating political differences is part of the culture in a way that debating religious differences is not two people entering into a relationship are likely to be more concerned with the former than the latter.That Riley suggests is a mistake. Early on a difference in faith may seem unimportant and an occasion for practicing tolerance while a difference over same-sex marriage or global warming or gun control may seem intractable and full of future hazard. (I can’t marry someone who believes that!) “But faith” Riley insists “is a tricky thing and it sneaks up on people” especially at significant moments when the pull of old loyalties supposedly outgrown reasserts itself. “The death of a loved one the birth of a child the loss of a job a move to a new city — all of these things can give people a sense of religious longing a desire to return to the faith of their childhood.”This can be true even of those whose childhood faith was weak and perfunctory. A Christian may think of herself or himself as not being religious at all yet “find it hard to imagine family life without a Christmas tree.” A wife or a husband also not particularly religious may feel that having a Christmas tree goes too far. In an interfaith marriage Riley observes holidays can “become like bargaining chips.” (I’ll do this if you’ll do that and if the children get to choose.) Even when one of the partners has converted and religious tensions have supposedly been eliminated the fact of conversion can be the source of its own tension as when one spouse in the course of an argument “plays the conversion card” and says “but I left my faith for you” or in other words “You owe me big-time and for a long time.”Once you begin to think about it it’s obvious how many potential pitfalls await interfaith couples but it is often not obvious to them Riley says for at least four reasons.First the liberal rhetoric of individualism and personal choice is casually affirmed without sufficient attention to the ways in which one’s choices and much else are influenced by tradition and community. Many interfaith couples have “chosen the romanticism and the individualistic ethos of America over the demands of the communities that they have come from” only to find later on that those demands still exert a force.Second young people today “consider religion to be a pursuit of the individual” and therefore downplay differences in ritual and doctrine; they minimize the requirements of faith by conceiving of faith as something without a specific content that might become the source of friction.Third the assertion found everywhere in American cultural life that differences are to be celebrated and embraced — our “obsession with tolerance at all costs” — obscures the extent to which those differences touch on something deep and immovable. “Ironically interfaith marriage may awaken people to the fact that … that the particulars of practice and belief do matter and that not all interfaith conflicts can be solved with the placement of a menorah next to a manger.”And fourth faith has become “racialized”; that is we have come to think that “like skin color [it] is a trait that need not divide us.” But Riley demurs believing that faith “is a superficial characteristic the way race [and] ethnicity are” doesn’t make it so. In fact “religious identity … can and should be considered” as more substantive than racial identity; and like any other substance it remains in place even when the commonplaces of multicultural doctrine tell us that it shouldn’t really matter.My rehearsal of Riley’s points may suggest that her book is a brief against interfaith marriage. Far from it. She is herself a partner in an interfaith marriage (and in an inter-racial one too) and she and her spouse have made it work. She just wants prospective interfaith couples to know that it is work that love doesn’t conquer all that “a rocky road may lie ahead of them” and that they “need to think in practical terms about their faith differences — how it will affect the way they spend their time their money and the way they want to raise their kids.” Her message is that if you don’t make the mistake of thinking it will be a bed of roses you’ll have a better chance of its not being a bed of thorns.

8,The war of the cola giants -Pepsi and Coca - threatens to wipe out the third world of soda pop. The supercolas have already swallowed 7-Up and Dr Pepper and there is grave doubt that Royal Crown Cola can survive as an independent carbonating force.This is an old story the concentration of power in few supercorporations and the disappearance of the rest of the competition. You don't have to be an antique to remember when the Hudson Packard Studebaker and Nash were as easily identifiable by American youngsters as the Chrysler Ford and General Motors cars.Now of course the surviving American auto brands look so much alike that it's hard for anybody to identify them.Same for beer. You constantly read stories about how there used to be thousands of beers but now there are only three that do any business and one of them is on the ropes. Being allergic to beer I am no judge but people who drink the stuff tell me that one brand of American beer tastes so much like another that a blindfold test would leave them baffled about which they were drinking.

9,Belmont Park will open its fall season this afternoon but one of the stars of the cast won't be there: Julie Krone who suffered multiple fractures of the right ankle and severe cuts on the left elbow in a violent spill Monday on Saratoga's final day.The 30-year-old jockey who ran second to Mike Smith for the riding title at Saratoga was transferred yesterday from Saratoga Hospital to the Staten Island University Hospital nearer her home in Colts Neck N.J. She was listed in good condition after a surgical procedure was performed Monday night to stabilize the ankle joint alleviate pain and splint the punctured left elbow.Krone was flown late yesterday afternoon from Saratoga to New York and taken by ambulance to the Staten Island hospital and placed in the care of Dr. Frank Ariosta an orthopedic surgeon who will perform further surgery to repair the ankle.Officials at Saratoga Hospital said that it was premature to gauge the impact of the injuries on Krone's career. But last night Brian Morris a spokesman for the Staten Island hospital said "She won't be able to walk for three months but could be able to ride within six months." He added that because jockeys are subjected to less foot stress than other athletes Krone should be able to continue her career which already includes riding titles at Belmont Park Monmouth Park Atlantic City and the Meadowlands. She also became the first woman to win any of the Triple Crown races when she rode Colonial Affair to victory in the Belmont Stakes in June.

Susan Gelfand is back with a theme that will jump right out at you if you know where to look.Today’s ThemeI’m not sure how many kids think of a JACK IN THE BOX as a fun toy (personally I found them terrifying) but we have four symmetrical JACKs in BOXes today. The JACK part of the entry is a rebus so you would write or type JACK all in one square. If you’re solving in our iOS app here’s how you enter more than one letter in a square:PhotoThe trick is knowing where to put those rebuses.We have [JACK]ASS crossing [JACK] FROST [JACK] POTS crossing [JACK] CHEESE FLAP [JACK] crossing LUMBER [JACK] (clued brilliantly as “Strong feller?” as in feller of trees) and CAR [JACK] crossing PHONE [JACK].The revealer JACK IN THE BOX is split today between 8D and 48D.In nontheme news I enjoyed RAVE MUSIC SEA TURTLE LEONINE NUTELLA (because yum) MAHALIA Jackson and Eve ENSLER author of “The Vagina Monologues.”Tricky Clues– From the Department of Now You Know: A BRAINO consists of “words or parts of words being missed out or swapped around when somebody is speaking often completely altering the meaning of what the person said. When it occurs the culprit normally doesn’t notice they did it until a few seconds later and often not until it is too late.” An example would be “I’m feeling fine and walking the dog” becoming “I’m walking fine and feeling the dog.”{Urban Dictionary}– When you see the phrase “First name in …” outside of crosswords you’re normally thinking of the most important person in a given genre. In this puzzle however you’re being asked to literally enter a first name in gospel and that would be MAHALIA (Jackson).– At 68A “Jabber?” appears to be asking about the act of talking too much. Today however the clue refers to something you can jab someone with like an ÉPÉE.– Clue of the Day for me was “Strong feller?” at 44D. A LUMBERJACK certainly could be a strong feller (for “fellow”) but you need to be a strong feller of trees to be a LUMBERJACK.Have you ever seen a SEA TURTLE and 70-80 of its nearest and dearest hatch and head for the ocean? I find this mesmerizing:Your thoughts?

9,''The young families will be able to take advantage of an on-site day-care center which is a first in a residential development in Westchester as far as I know'' said Mitchell Hochberg president of Spectrum Skanska of Valhalla one of three partners in the joint venture. The others are CareMatrix Corporation of Needham Mass. a provider of housing for the elderly and Benenson Capital Company a privately owned development concern based in Manhattan.In designing the project the developers borrowed concepts from ''new urbanism'' which in its purest form is meant to create self-contained communities with their own shops schools and recreation.''New urbanism really means trying to eliminate the car completely and we're not trying to do that here'' Mr. Hochberg said. ''I don't think that in its purest form new urbanism really works. What we're trying to do here is borrow the best of it which means having all kinds of people together and give them space and reasons to gather. I think it's something that's been happening in other parts of the country but it's been very slow in coming here.''The houses will be designed to look like those in a place like Charleston S.C. Mr. Hochberg said. The garages will be at the backs of the houses with porches on the fronts to encourage people to congregate outside. ''This way people can sit on their front porches and see their neighbors pass by on their way to the village green or the community center.The focal point of the development will be an oval-shaped village green which will be almost as large as a football field. The 18000-square-foot community center nearby will have a pool full-court basketball gym and a computer room. ''From 4 P.M. to 8 P.M. we'll have a teacher at the computer room'' Mr. Hochberg said. ''We hope to attract 8- to 16-year-olds and give them something to do after school.''
1,Me Myself and Math a six-part series by Steven Strogatz looks at us through the lens of math.By an amazing coincidence my sister Cathy and my Aunt Vere have the same birthday: April 4.Actually it’s not so amazing. In any extended family with enough siblings aunts uncles and cousins you’d expect at least one such birthday coincidence. Certainly if there are 366 people in the family — more relatives than days of the year — they can’t all have different birthdays so a match is guaranteed in a family this big. (Or if you’re worried about leap year make it 367.)But suppose we don’t insist on absolute certainty. A classic puzzle called the “birthday problem” asks: How many people would be enough to make the odds of a match at least 50-50?The answer just 23 people comes as a shock to most of us the first time we hear it. Partly that’s because it’s so much less than 366. But it’s also because we tend to mistake the question for one about ourselves. My birthday.John Allen Paulos gave a vivid example of this error in his trenchant best seller “Innumeracy”:A couple of years ago someone on the Johnny Carson show was trying to explain [why 23 is the answer to the birthday problem]. Johnny Carson didn’t believe it noted that there were about 120 people in the studio audience and asked how many of them shared his birthday of say March 19. No one did and the guest who wasn’t a mathematician said something incomprehensible in his defense.For years I’ve been dying to see a clip of that scene. It’s become legendary an iconic moment in mathematical pop culture. Yet I couldn’t find it on YouTube and none of my colleagues including Paulos could remember when it occurred or who the humiliated guest was. Memories have understandably faded over the years.But fortunately as of 2010 every surviving tape of “The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson” has been digitized and made publicly available. Thanks to the Carson archives and some ace detective work by a researcher at The Times we can now watch what really happened when Johnny met the birthday problem. The encounter offers lessons not just about math but about memory as well.Before we get to the clip you may be wondering why the birthday problem is worth studying. For one thing it highlights how wrong our intuition can be about coincidences and how easily we underestimate the power of chance — a cautionary lesson for anyone working in sports finance or any other field where fluky things happen a lot.Second the reasoning used to solve the birthday problem is transferable. Medical statisticians use it to estimate the likelihood of finding matches within pools of potential transplant donors and recipients on such characteristics as blood type Rh factors and other immunological markers. Criminologists use it to calculate how many partial matches between DNA profiles they should expect to find — by chance alone — when trawling databases of convicted offenders. Cryptographers use it to analyze malicious “birthday attacks” that adversaries can deploy to subvert digital signatures.To work our way toward solving the birthday problem let’s first simplify it by assuming there are 365 days in the year and that all birthdays are independent and equally likely. Under these assumptions we want to figure out how many people we need for the odds to be better than 50-50 that at least two of them have the same birthday.The solution relies on a single principle used over and over. I’ll call it the combination principle but it’s just common sense. Anyone who gets dressed in the morning knows it.Suppose you have 3 pairs of pants and 5 shirts. (I realize you probably have more than this but pretend you’re a math professor.) How many different outfits can you create? (And don’t worry if some of the shirts and pants don’t go too well together — remember you’re a math professor!) Say you decide to wear your ratty blue jeans. Then with five shirts to choose from that gives you 5 outfits right there. Or you could wear those nice polyester khakis you still have from your high school graduation. Combine them with any of the five shirts and that’s another 5 outfits. Finally you could go casual and wear your Star Trek sweat pants along with any of the five shirts creating 5 more outfits and bringing the total to 3 times 5 or 15 outfits in all.That’s the combination principle in action: If you can make M choices of one thing (like 3 pairs of pants) and N choices of another (like 5 shirts) you can make M x N combinations of them both (15 outfits). The principle also extends to more than two things. If you want to top off your outfit with a stylish hat and you have 6 to choose from you can create 3 x 5 x 6 = 90 ensembles of pants shirts and hats.Next let’s apply this principle to a warm-up birthday problem featuring the first three United States presidents. Relative to the New Style (Gregorian) calendar George Washington was born on Feb. 22 John Adams on Oct. 30 and Thomas Jefferson on April 13. Unsurprisingly no matches. To figure out the odds of this happening by chance we imagine alternate realities — all the possible combinations of birthdays that could have occurred — and then calculate what fraction of those combinations involve three distinct birthdays.According to the combination principle there are 365 x 365 x 365 combinations of three birthdays since any day of the year is possible for each of the three presidents. To count how many of these combinations contain no matches let Washington go first. He has all 365 days at his disposal. But once his birthday is fixed he leaves Adams with only 364 choices to avoid a match which in turn leaves Jefferson only 363. So by the combination principle there are 365 x 364 x 363 nonmatching combinations of three birthdays out of a total of 365 x 365 x 365 combinations altogether.Hence the probability that all three birthdays differ is the ratio of these huge numbers:which is about 0.9918 or 99.18 percent. In other words it was almost a sure thing that none of the birthdays would match as we’d expect by common sense.To extend this result to four or more people look again at the fraction above and savor the patterns in it. For three people the fraction has three descending numbers — 365 364 363 — in the numerator and three copies of 365 in the denominator. So for four people the natural and correct guess is that the answer becomesThis expression is merely the fraction we found earlier for three people multiplied by 362/365. Doing the arithmetic then gives 0.9836 or a 98.36 percent chance that four random people have four different birthdays. That means the probability that two or more of them share a birthday is about 1 – 0.9836 = 0.0164 or 1.64 percent.Continuing in this way ideally with the help of a spreadsheet computer or online birthday problem calculator we can crank out the corresponding probabilities for any number of people. The calculations show that the odds of a match rise sharply as the group gets larger. With 10 people the odds are almost 12 percent; with 20 people 41 percent. When we reach the magic number of 23 people the odds climb above 50 percent for the first time which is what we were trying to prove.Intuitively how can 23 people be enough? It’s because of all the combinations they create all the opportunities for luck to strike. With 23 people there are 253 possible pairs of people (see the notes for why) and that turns out to be enough to push the odds of a match above 50 percent.Incidentally if you go up to 43 people — the number of individuals who have served as United States president so far — the odds of a match increase to 92 percent. And indeed two of the presidents do have the same birthday: James Polk and Warren Harding were both born on Nov. 2.And now… here’s Johnny! On Feb. 6 1980 about 14 minutes into “The Tonight Show” Johnny Carson and his sidekick Ed McMahon begin bantering about Ed’s upcoming birthday and famous Americans born in February. Then Johnny changes gears and says “You know I’m gonna try something tonight. Now I may get this wrong. I remember this from a long time ago.” He tries to pose the birthday problem fumbles a bit with the phrasing and finally comes up with this formulation: “How many people would you think would have to be in a room that your odds would be almost sure that they would have exactly the same birthday on the same day?”Douglas C. Pizac/Associated PressEd guesses 1000 which suggests he doesn’t understand the question since 366 people already ensure a match. Johnny shakes his head slightly and says “Something like 35 or 40.” “That’s all?” Ed interjects surprised and Johnny continues “the odds are pretty good if I remember.”You’ve got to appreciate what a bombshell this is at least in my world: Contrary to the collective memory of the mathematical community it wasn’t a guest scientist who posed the puzzle that night — it was Johnny himself! Though in retrospect our mistake was predictable. As with many other false memories and urban legends our garbled recollection makes more sense than what actually happened. We don’t normally think of Johnny as someone who’d pose a classic math problem and know its surprising answer.Then comes the next twist: Ed leads Johnny astray. He says “Pick a day and see if we have it.” Johnny says “Lady in the front row what’s your birthday?” “August 9” she says. “Anyone else here have a birthday on August 9?” asks Johnny. “No?” He looks baffled. “We have 500 people here.” They try someone else’s birthday April 9 and again there are no matches. Ed acts vindicated and the audience finds the whole thing hilarious.What went wrong? Johnny did the wrong experiment! By asking for matches specifically to August 9 (or to April 9) he altered the problem. The original problem asked for a match between any two people on any day. A much larger number of people (253 as it turns out) are required for there to be a better than even chance of finding a match to a specific birthday like Aug. 9.Let me leave you with one last coincidence to ponder. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died on the same day — the Fourth of July 1826 exactly 50 years after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.Math can’t explain everything.NOTES1. After his debacle with the birthday problem on Feb. 6 Johnny Carson tried two more experiments with his studio audience on the following nights. Take a look at these clips from Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 — they contain instructive errors of their own as well as priceless comedic moments.2. If you’d like to watch the rest of these or any of the other surviving episodes of “The Tonight Show” they can be viewed at the Carson archives but first you’ll need to register for a free account. You can also find dozens of immortal television moments by poking around at the Carson Web site reviewed in this news feature.3. For those too young to remember who Johnny Carson was see the American Masters documentary “Johnny Carson: King of Late Night.” As the PBS Web site notes Johnny was “seen by more people on more occasions than anyone else in American history. Over the course of 30 years 4531 episodes and 23000 guests he became a fixture of national life and a part of the zeitgeist. In a 2007 TV Land/Entertainment Weekly poll Americans voted Carson the greatest icon in the history of television.”4. The quoted excerpt from “Innumeracy” appears on page 36 of J. A. Paulos “Innumeracy” (Hill and Wang 1989). You can find other versions of the same story (many of which have mutated as in the children’s game of “telephone”) by searching the Web or Google Books for “Johnny Carson birthday problem.”5. The solution of the birthday problem given above contains three standard simplifying assumptions. It assumes there are 365 days in a year (which ignores leap years); all birthdays are equally likely (which ignores daily and seasonal variations in birth rates); and all birthdays are chosen independently (which ignores the possibility of twins or triplets or any other non-random connections that tie people’s birthdays together).In reality birth rates are not uniform throughout the year. Furthermore the pattern of variation is different in different parts of the world. In the United States for example daily birth rates rise in the summer and fall in the winter ranging from about 7 percent above average in September to 5 percent below average in January. Yet the answer to the birthday problem remains 23 even after these seasonal variations are taken into account as shown in T. S. Nunnikhoven “A birthday problem solution for nonuniform birth frequencies” The American Statistician Vol. 46 No. 4 (Nov. 1992) pp. 270–274 and further discussed in M. C. Borja and J. Haigh “The birthday problem” Significance Vol. 4 No. 3 (September 2007) pp. 124–127 and the references therein.6. Why are there 253 pairs of people in a group of 23? Because each of the 23 people has 22 possible partners. That makes 23 times 22 = 506 possible ordered pairs if we always list the partner second. But order is meaningless here; a pair like (Ed Johnny) is the same as (Johnny Ed). To avoid such double counting we take half of 506 which gives 253.7. Click on the following links for real-world applications of the birthday problem to class phenotype probabilities in medicine (relevant to finding compatible transplant donors and recipients); the legal controversy surrounding the interpretation of partial matches obtained by “all-pairs trawling” of DNA profiles; and the birthday attack in cryptography. The birthday problem has also shed light on coincidences in daily life; see P. Diaconis and F. Mosteller “Methods for studying coincidences” Journal of the American Statistical Association Vol. 84 No. 408 (December 1989) pp. 853–861.8. Here’s an online simulator that generates random lists of birthdays for groups of different sizes. Playing with it is a great way to get intuition about the birthday problem.Thanks to Craig Nansen John Allen Paulos Bill Peterson and Lauren Seligman for helping me track down the Carson clips; Jeff Sotzing at the Carson Entertainment Group for his generosity in licensing the clips; and Paul Ginsparg Bobby Kleinberg and Carole Schiffman for their comments and suggestions.
8,Some see it as the rebirth of the belle epoque style; others detect links to 19th-century dandyism; still others regard it as divine decadence. Regardless traditional decorating seems to be changing course and nowhere is the shift more evident than in the fabrics that are currently turning decorators' heads.Unlike the American and English country styles that have been so popular in recent years the new old-look is not characterized by innocent little prints pretty ''bedroom'' colors or grandmotherly flowered chintz. It is more opulent more daring more masculine more French - far more evocative of Beau Brummell than Miss Marple or Betsy Ross.Decorators say that they are using more paisleys more velvets more tassels braid and fringe. '' 'Amusing' fabrics are also very big'' says Sam Watters a decorator who has done most of his work in the traditional mode.Indeed in the for-the-trade-only showrooms this winter things are seldom what they seem. Cottons have been printed to resemble everything from horsehair to leopard skin to silk moire. Canvas has been given hand-painted finishes suggestive of marble gemstones and peau de soie. Chintz a perennial favorite among traditionalists is more likely to look like the endpapers of a well-bound book than a bower at the height of bloom.

9,Look anything with elastomeric fins and grips has to be worth a few extra cents.Those features are the key elements on the Gillette Company's latest shaver -- make that "shaving system" -- for men that was announced yesterday the Sensor Excel.The new product is available in Europe and Canada and will be sold elsewhere in the world including the United States as soon as officials of the company measure its success.For Gillette the Sensor Excel represents the latest shaving technology following the wildly successful Sensor System which began shearing men in 1990. The new product was tested by more than 5800 men whose responses that its soft fins near the blades contributed to smoother shaves convinced Gillette that it could charge about $4 for the product about 15 percent higher than the Sensor."On the basis of testing Sensor Excel has demonstrated to be an absolutely superior product" said Robert J. Murray the executive vice president of Gillette's North American Group.

0,Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed a bill this afternoon requiring manufacturers of computers monitors televisions and other electronic equipment to accept their products for recycling when returned by any person in the city and to dispose of the equipment properly. The legislation was passed by the City Council last Wednesday despite reservations by the mayor over its guidelines.To ensure its passage the Council speaker Christine C. Quinn had withdrawn the original bill and reintroduced it as two pieces of legislation one that begins to establish the program and that Mr. Bloomberg agreed to sign into law and one that sets collection standards that he is expected to veto.Under the legislation that passed electronics manufacturers will devise and run programs that could include curbside pickups neighborhood collections and returns by mail and in stores. Consumers would be required to participate and by 2010 would face a $100 fine for throwing old computers televisions and other gadgets into the trash. Manufacturers who fail to recycle returned merchandise could be fined $1000 for each violation. The programs would require Department of Sanitation approval.Still uncertain are the collection standards which would require manufacturers to take back a stated tonnage of equipment or face fines an element that has angered suppliers who say it would be hard to track sales in the city.Twelve states have already adopted electronic waste laws. New York City is the first municipality to do so the mayor said.The mayor also signed bills requiring timely pruning of trees or vegetation that cover traffic signals or signs; requiring the city’s Department of Transportation to improve conditions at 20 locations with the highest number of traffic accidents; and extending the deadline for submission of the executive budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 to May 2 from April 26.
8,Last Thursday Lilco agreed to sell the $5.3 billion Shoreham plant for $1 to New York which has opposed its opening because of safety concerns and which plans to decommission it. Since then state and Lilco officials have worked on an agreement to be presented to the Long Island Power Authority the State Public Service Commission the Legislature and other agencies for approval.Officials said a meeting of the power authority which Mr. Cuomo has said must approve the agreement could be scheduled as early as Thursday. A power authority spokesman Stephen Villano said the agency's consultants are studying the agreement adding that a decision by the trustees could come quickly.In another development today Lilco's board rejected the power authority's $8.75 billion bid to buy the utility. In a letter to William L. Mack the power authority's chairman Dr. Catacosinos said Lilco's evaluation committee - a group of outside directors -determined that the latest offer is ''not fair to Lilco and all its shareowners and is therefore rejected.''Mr. Villano said the authority would have no immediate response to Lilco's rejection of its offer which had been widely expected. He said the authority would ''consider its next course of action'' within a week's time. Legislative Approval NeededOf all the agencies that must approve the accord the power authority is the one expected to offer the least resistance. Six of its nine trustees have already expressed support for a negotiated settlement and several have begun to rally support for an accord.

1,Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.When recruiting began in February 1863 for the 54th Massachusetts – one of the first regiments in the Union Army composed of Northern free blacks–many Bostonians expected Robert Morris to be among its strongest boosters. A key figure in the city’s black leadership Morris had spent much of the previous decade demanding a place for his black military company in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. He passionately believed that the spectacle of black men arrayed in the state’s uniforms marching in disciplined ranks would force a change in how most whites perceived them replacing inchoate fears of slave rebellion with admiration for the newest members of the citizen-soldiery.But Morris’s devotion to the ideal of military service was less ardent than his commitment to an overriding principle: black participation in public life must take place on terms of perfect equality. The first black lawyer to try a case in Massachusetts Morris served as co-counsel to the white abolitionist Charles Sumner in the 1849 school-desegregation case that put forward the principle of “equality before the law.” When that suit failed Morris helped organize blockades of the city’s segregated black primary school preferring to see it shuttered than to allow Jim Crow education to continue. He also took part as the city’s black men threw themselves into antislavery party politics yielding alliances with whites that finally brought school desegregation in 1855.Around the same time he began organizing a black military company which he hoped would some day become part of the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. During the 1850s Morris devoted a great deal of time and energy to his “Massasoit Guards.” He repeatedly headed petition drives asking the state to embrace the company but he made demands as well: not only would the state have to sanction the company’s activities which had been the case for black militias in a few other Northern cities but the legislature would have to strike the word “white” from the state’s militia law.Morris asked too much. Federal militia law not just Massachusetts state law specified that only white men could serve. Beyond this the enlistment of a black company would outrage many whites in the North as well as the South who had been raised to see black men under arms as threats to good order not as its defenders. Not surprisingly white politicians – even in the comparatively friendly environment of 1850s Massachusetts – generally refused to take the steps Morris demanded. As a result Morris’s men never donned their uniforms and the Massasoit Guards dissolved in acrimony. Instead another group of black men who called themselves the “Liberty Guard” and whose leaders did not insist on full recognition became the first to march through Boston’s streets in 1857.PhotoWhen the Civil War began Morris renewed his campaign for black military service. But while declaring himself “ready to defend the flag of the common country against the common foe” he added a crucial qualification. He believed black men should volunteer only “when the removal of disabilities allowed them to do so on terms of equality.” The word “white” would still have to go.In 1861 both the offer and the threat passed largely unnoticed. Massachusetts refused the services of a prospective home guard of black men joining a national consensus that the Civil War like American citizenship was to be the province of white men.Less than two years later however the Emancipation Proclamation opened a path to black military service. By February 1863 the War Department charged Massachusetts’s abolitionist governor John Andrew with organizing the first black Northern regiment.Morris seized the moment to demand equal service. Equal pay was not at issue: all believed — incorrectly as it turned out — that the War Department would pay black soldiers the same wages as white. Morris’s demand was instead that black regiments include black commissioned officers. In early February he called upon Andrew bringing with him another pioneering black professional the European-trained physician Dr. John V. DeGrasse. Within days the governor had telegraphed Senator Charles Sumner pleading for his help in getting the War Department to allow the appointment of black commissioned officers. Morris and DeGrasse may even have put their own names forward in pressing the case for equality for Andrew wrote that “an interdict including member Mass. Med. Soc. speaking four languages and member Suffolk bar is prejudicial.”The War Department would not bend. So at a Feb. 16 1863 recruitment meeting Morris reiterated the position he had taken in 1861: black men should refuse to serve until they could do so on terms of perfect equality. Others including the famously uncompromising white abolitionist Wendell Phillips this time urged black men to take half a loaf — to seize the opportunity offered them despite its limitations. But Morris declared it black men’s duty to “go right” — to serve only once they could be officers and the state struck the word “white” from its militia law. Morris’s colleague William Wells Brown offered the simplest form of the same prescription: “Equality first guns afterward.”The bitter words of black and white recruiters tell us that Morris and his allies did their work well that winter and spring. Morris’s longtime colleague William Nell publicly lamented that “owing to a combination wholly unexpected and never to be too much regretted numbers of young men were induced to refrain from enlisting in the 54th and thus lost the golden privilege of having their names enrolled in the first colored regiment from the North.” Robert Gould Shaw the commander of the 54th put it more bluntly. “The influential colored men of Boston” he complained “have done us more harm” than good. Morris’s protégé Edwin Garrison Walker even claimed that opposition to recruitment brought Morris to the verge of being arrested and imprisoned.Of course many black activists did support enlistment. Leading black Bostonians like Nell the former fugitive Lewis Hayden and Rev. Leonard Grimes threw themselves into the work. Recruiters fanned out across the North and Canada and the training camp at Readville swelled with volunteers. On May 28 the 54th marched through Boston at full strength numbering over 1000 men and officers.But where Boston itself was concerned this initial phase of recruiting was a dismal failure. During the 1850s nearly 100 of the city’s men had proclaimed their desire to serve in a black militia unit. In 1861 125 had stepped forward in a single evening to volunteer for the proposed home guard. But after months of recruiting in the winter and spring of 1863 – including countless pro-enlistment meetings the placement of a recruiting office in the city’s most heavily black neighborhood and the earnest entreaties of prominent white and black activists — the harvest was meager: of the more than 1000 black men in uniform who sailed south that spring fewer than 40 listed Boston as their place of residence.The 54th’s celebrated battles especially its brave doomed assault on South Carolina’s Fort Wagner that July changed many minds. Over the next months and years enlistment surged in Boston and beyond. By war’s end an astonishing 71 percent of the eligible black men in the nonslave states had entered military service.Related Disunion Highlights Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. See the Highlights »Black soldiery we are often told sowed the seeds of equal citizenship. Abraham Lincoln famously suggested as early as March 1864 that such “gallant” service seemed to entitle at least “some of the colored people” to the full rights of citizenship; by the last week of his life he made this case in public. The linkage between military service and equality seemed to grow stronger with each passing month.Yet that linkage was not forged only in the heat of battle. It was also forged in the struggles over recruitment equal pay and black commissioned officers. These struggles challenged white Americans to understand black enlistment in the Union military not as an unthinking or inevitable response to Lincoln’s invitation but as a self-conscious moral and political act. By insisting on complete equality as a bedrock principle these rebels and dissenters helped policy makers and citizens throughout the Union see African-Americans in the terms Morris had long dreamed of: not just as men willing to don a uniform but as fellow citizens cognizant of their rights and determined to secure them.Morris nearly 40 years old when recruitment began never took up arms. He returned to his legal practice and to dreams of a career as a local politician. But he nevertheless played an important role in African-Americans’ Civil War — not in the battle to defeat the Confederacy but in the battle to transform the American republic into a place where black people could fully belong.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Stephen Kantrowitz is a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of “More Than Freedom: Fighting for Black Citizenship in a White Republic 1829-1889.”

0,Edward Rivera the author of the autobiographical novel ''Family Installments: Memoirs of Growing Up Hispanic'' and an assistant professor at City College of New York died on Aug. 25 in Manhattan where he lived. He was 62.The cause was a heart attack said his brother Richard.When ''Family Installments'' was published in 1982 it drew attention as a groundbreaking book dealing with Latino life in Puerto Rico and New York City. In a review in The New York Times Book Review Philip Lopate said that the novel was ''noisily brimming with life'' and praised it for its ''graceful lyrical language.'' Richard Rivera said that his brother's book took 10 years to write and that it was ''a way of documenting the importance of our family in his life and the pain of culturation.''Although this was his only book he also wrote short stories and essays which were published in literary magazines and later anthologized. In a sardonic essay in The Massachusetts Review in 1996 he recalled the difficulty he had in finding a publisher for his novel because it did not fit preconceived notions of what he called ''Underclass Lit.''Mr. Rivera was born in Puerto Rico grew up in New York and earned degrees from City College and Columbia University. He taught in the English department at City College and at the college's Center for Worker Education since 1969. He was known as a mentor to younger writers including Abraham Rodriguez Jr. and Junot Diaz.

7,After seven months of stalemate at the bargaining table striking elevator constructors in this city have voted to go back to work under a contract only slightly different from the three‐year pacts a dozen other construction crafts accepted many months ago.The long tie‐up forced 50000 other building unionists into idleness and caused heavy losses to contractors and prospective tenants in high‐rise office and apartment buildings. One reason the stoppage lasted so long was the outrageous provision in the New York State Unemployment Insurance Law that puts employers in the position of having to help subsidize strikes against themselves.New York and Rhode Island are alone among the fifty states to permit strikers to draw unemployment insurance benefits; the funds out of which the benefits come are built up exclusively through employer taxes. An estimated $2 million in benefits was paid to strikers during the various stages of the marathon construction stoppage.This latest evidence of the perversion of unemployment insurance into a spur for union intransigence in collective bargaining ought finally awaken the State Legislature to the need for amending the law to end a strike subsidy that contributes neither to justice nor to industrial peace.

9,FROM the mid-1970's to the mid-80's museum exhibitions of corporate art collections were nearly commonplace. But they are rare today and it is not because business has lost interest in the subject.Far from it. In the last decade the number of companies acquiring art has gone from 300 to about 1200 according to the Directory of Corporate Art Collections.Still it seems that more corporations are keeping their art at home for the edification of their employees and for visiting clients. Whatever the reasons -- and no doubt the growing cost of insurance is one of them -- they have not deterred the 13 companies represented in "Corporations Collect I" at the Morris Museum.The most venerable lender is the chemicals manufacturer Ciba-Geigy which began acquiring in 1959 and now owns about 600 works. Initiated 10 years later the holdings of the Prudential Insurance Company now total more than 11000 items; the Chemical Bank has gathered 2000 pieces gathered over the same period. And in 20 years A.T.& T. has amassed 3500 works. As collectors the remaining corporations are Johnny-come-latelies but Schering-Plough and Nabisco maintain galleries that display New Jersey artists.

9,Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern and other Parks Department officials declined to comment. An official who spoke only on the condition that neither he nor his agency be identified said ''Calling it a park site conveys a sense of permanence.''The housing agency began its campaign to redevelop the garden sites in late 1996 by evicting gardeners from 50 of them and beginning development plans. Construction has started on a few sites and design has been done on others.At about the same time the department announced that all gardens under its jurisdiction would be open for development or sale. Now its inventory of garden sites has more than doubled though they still represent just a small fraction of the 11000 city-owned vacant lots.Frank Braconi executive director of Citizens Housing and Policy Council a research group sponsored by the real estate industry said the danger is that temporary uses even if clearly defined in advance can be very hard to end. ''If I were the city and knew that temporary uses all become entrenched in stone I would never allow temporary uses'' he said.He suggested that the new policy however reasonable could mean an uglier city. ''We could end up with a lot of empty lots with cyclone fences around them'' he said.That is exactly the vision being suggested by a coalition of nine environmental groups called New York City Green which said it was studying possible legal actions. Some advocates have urged that all the gardens be preserved though others have said they would be satisfied with clear criteria for deciding which gardens should be preserved and which should be housing sites.''This is nothing but a land grab'' said Steven Frillmann executive director of the Green Guerrillas an environmental group that built its first community garden in 1973 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. ''But we don't suffer from tunnel vision'' he said. ''We're not saying we have to hold on to every garden.''

8,A few weeks later since fishing is her passion and my mother's friend is no fisherman I searched out the bamboo poles from the depths of the woodshed. We spent an hour sanding rust from the old hooks. ''Every time we fished we had to sand every single one clean'' she said. ''Father would never throw a one of them away.''We stashed the bank poles in the trunk and drove to the river where everything's feeding on whatever's in reach: dragonflies mosquitoes water snakes on top bass catfish crappie in the sinkholes and stalking the mussel beds the great blue herons. Mother cocked her head listening. '' 'Can't catch when the locusts grind' is what father always said.'' But we did: The next morning a single pole bobbed and dipped a nice blue channel cat. Back home she pried the hook free studied it a moment then tossed it in the garbage.Should I dwell on her strength - plunging a butcher knife into the channel cat's steel-gray head - or her need - angry and red-faced at her impotence before the medical bureaucracy? Anyone who's not dealt with health-care systems for the elderly is in for an education. I know what we wanted to hear myself and my scattered brothers and sisters: she's doing fine she loves our visits but doesn't need our help she has her bridge club bowling golf reading volunteer work the church friends. Over long-distance lines in letters she tells us this and we believe her.But a summer is a long time to keep up an illusion and one Monday morning after I'd been gone for the weekend she dropped her guard. ''It's Sunday afternoons that get to you'' she said. ''There's nobody to call nothing on television a million things you can't bring yourself to do. Sometimes I just get in the car and drive.'' Then she stood abruptly and disappeared to reappear a half-hour later waving a wrench: ''I fixed the toilet'' she said. I checked it out: the leak was gone.I was in Kentucky for only three months but things move fast in California - out of sight out of mind. To listen to my friends I might have been leaving for Beulah Land. Three months in Kentucky? Drop a line my San Francisco friends said and I could have cut their skepticism with a knife. Let us know how it goes they said we're thinking of doing the same for our folks.

9,As someone who served in the Air Force in World War II and again in the Korean conflict I would comment:The military is an artificial society with its own traditions requirements and purposes. Asking the military to catch up to modern society in terms of its gestalt is absurdThere is no right to serve. In fact the military refuses to accept many otherwise qualified people for reasons that may seem slight until they are subjected to combat stress -- flat feet colorblindness wrong height wrong weight asthma attack after age 12.Let us focus on AIDS. The military draws over four-fifths of its blood supply from its own people. Dog tags carry each serviceman's/woman's blood type to facilitate transfusions in emergency and combat situtions.I would refuse to accept a transfusion from a blood supply to which homosexuals had contributed. If I were in an emergency situation and there was no donor but a known homosexual available I'd bleed a long time waiting for someone I could trust.
1,Townies is a series about life in New York and occasionally other cities.In Hong Kong where I lived until I was 14 most expat kids had more than one passport; spoke English Cantonese (curse words were the gateway) and at least one romance language; and we could emulate several accents convincingly. We were well-designed for espionage.So when my father moved us from a skyscraper near the horse racing track in Hong Kong to a red brick house in San Antonio I already had a taupe American cadence prepared that I’d borrowed from “Kate and Allie” reruns and a Virginia-born boyfriend. By the time Britain returned Hong Kong to China — three years after I’d left and 156 years after they’d taken it over — I had also acquired when the occasion demanded it a quiver of y’alls.In suburban Texas I switched on the television to watch the stringently polite ceremony called “the handover.” I was a half hour from fleeing the experimental independence of a one-bedroom apartment I paid $75 a month to share with five high school classmates and heading back to my parents air-conditioned house 15 blocks away. My roommates nattered on about the soldiers’ trim yarn-dyed outfits boots and matching hats that did admittedly make the whole thing look like the reenactment of a battle between warring tribes of chauffeurs. Flags were solemnly lowered and folded fireworks were shot into the air and 6.3 million people suddenly found themselves standing in a special administrative region instead of a crown colony.I felt like my insides had been scooped out. But I mentally cauterized the dry socket behind my sternum finished cramming tangled clothes and small appliances into my Honda Civic waved shut the car door and drove off.Manhattan still reminds me of Hong Kong. And it’s not just the disparate population spellbinding skyline and internationally recognized address.I’m great at leaving. I am less talented at getting left though I should be better given how much it’s happened. Hong Kong was a train station set to techno and social circles depended on the location of your father’s employ. You could never rely on having the same friends year in and out. You never knew when your own number was going to get called. How expats process upheaval is where we differ from immigrants. There is a tacit understanding among us that maudlin goodbyes are indulgent and uncalled for.Hong Kong had a wildly diverse population of expatriates saying their unsentimental farewells. There were enough British French Germans and Americans that they all had their own primary and secondary schools. (I attended the English system with Korean school on Saturdays.) But the schools were not as balkanized as you’d expect. Not with such an efficient latchkey-kid-friendly public transportation system. Not when the legal drinking age of 18 was more suggestion than law and most of us by age 10 or 11 had experimented with inexpensive caustic rice wine mixed with sugary juice drink. Not when whole nightclubs were dominated by 13-year-olds trying to befriend 16-year-olds from across town. A successful night was judged by how many upperclassmen greeted you or hated your guts the following Monday. Both responses were regarded positively.We were emboldened by props that are only viewed as grown-up by children like Marlboro 100’s and near-neon triple-shot tequila sunrises in skinny glasses with black straws. We also had a thing for four-star hotel restaurants and were rarely booted from dining rooms despite brazenly filching canapés and plucking medium-rare medallions from lavish buffets with panoramic backdrops. To better blend in while filling our bellies we’d frequently strike up conversations with lone international travelers. Like an anthropologist I enjoyed hoarding the stories and idioms of these exotic strangers and the memories of their shoes.Now in New York when people skip states disappear into marriages and young families or simply get pruned along the way it can be difficult for me to feel anything beyond a distracted curiosity. Maybe the detachment is useful. Perhaps it only seems like a bad thing. Like holding the single allele of sickle-cell anemia that ends up heightening a resistance to malaria. All I know is that a force field makes navigation in a frenetic New York easier. As does the ability to cold read anyone you meet along the way then shape-shift your accent cadence syntax and semantics to best suit them.Jungyeon RohManhattan after eight years here still reminds me of Hong Kong. There are parts of Chinatown that are the spit and image of streets in Wan Chai and I am held in thrall by the Chrysler building as much as I was by I.M. Pei’s Bank of China Tower. But in the consolation facsimile I had first sought for superficial reasons — the dense disparate population spellbinding skyline internationally recognized address — I hadn’t considered the implication of the city’s pace or the composition of its inhabitants. I fit in. It’s not just that the ingrained muscle memory for social navigation and a hearty tolerance for alcohol acquired in Hong Kong turned out to be felicitous traits in New York. It’s that here sometimes I get to sound like myself.At a friend’s recent dinner party I met a British man who was born in Hong Kong and now lives in the West Village. He is the publisher and editor of a hardcover travel and food magazine and I immediately recognized the ease the voracity with which he navigated Asia and Europe as something familiar that special expat birthright. We knew many of the same people both here and in Hong Kong but had somehow always missed one other. We exasperated our host and alienated other guests by competitively peppering each other with Cantonese slang from the early ’90s. With him I did not modulate the corners of my consonants. Words clattered out at a clip that could not be checked for quality or calculation.In New York I find I am less watchful less greedy less restless. Besides I have finally acquired a handful of friends that I do not hold at arm’s length to analyze. And with them I do not secrete every meaningful thought away in the apothecary drawers in my brain. They ask me questions and I respond with answers not decoys or digressions. With them too especially when I’m angry or excited my language is unguarded. I am suddenly “chuffed” instead of proud “skint” in place of broke eat “crisps” and an “aiyah” may make an appearance to indicate alarm. They rib me about my guilelessly disclosed peripatetic hodgepodge my squirmy diphthongs and strange argot. But I am grateful that they get through my force field. I even tell them so.Mary H.K.

0,Mario Perez/ABCLast week we found ourselves marveling at the work of Sterling Beaumon the 13-year-old actor on “Lost” who plays the junior version of Benjamin Linus the show’s resident genius of ambiguous morality (whose grown-up incarnation is played by Michael Emerson). A few days later in a crazy twist of fate involving time travel smoke monsters and a helpful publicist we found ourselves on the phone with the young actor. In this conversation with Sterling (which may contain spoilers for the uninitiated) he spoke with us about the polarizing “Lost” cliffhanger he was involved in last week and ended up quizzing us about what we think is taking place on the show.How were you cast to play Young Ben on “Lost”?I went through like three auditions and the first one was with the casting director April Webster. And I guess I did really good because she said right in the room “Oh I’m going to want to bring you back to the producers and writers.” They took a week or so and then they decided yeah we want you as this character Young Ben. But this is way back in season 3. So then it evolved from season 3 to season 5.Were you a fan of “Lost” at the time?No I actually wasn’t watching the show. I actually hated the show before I was on it. [laughs] Because I was on another show on ABC called “In Case of Emergency” and my episode that I guest-starred on kept on getting pre-empted because of “Lost.”What did you think about the grown-up version of Ben?The only episode I had watched in season 3 was my episode when it aired. So we waited on season 3 to come out on DVD before watched the rest. Then I thought he was a total jerk. But now after season 4 I think he has a method to his madness.Which is…?I have no idea but I think he’s a good guy in the end. He always has a plan and it hasn’t turned out that badly lately. And of course now that we know that the people on the freighter were not exactly the greatest people in the world it just seems like maybe he really did save them.Are you asked to base your performance on Michael Emerson?My first episode of season 5 Jack Bender [a “Lost” director and executive producer] told me “Don’t act like Ben. It will ruin what’s to come.” You have to have a little bit of him in there because that’s totally impractical for him to change 150 percent. So I have a little bit of him in there but he’s a nice sweet innocent kid. But he’s a very devious kid.How is he devious?Uh he blew up a house.Good point. Was it at all difficult for you to film the very brutal cliffhanger that concluded last week’s episode?Oh it was so much fun. I was so excited.Really?Yes. In fact everybody had a controversy with a kid getting shot on TV. But I didn’t care and neither did my mom. I found it funny.It was controversial on the set?No they had to do it in the script. But everybody now after the episode was aired everybody online or everybody that I talk to is freaking out. They said They can’t shoot a kid!But you were comfortable doing it?I’m fine with it. As long as it makes the show have better ratings I’m cool.Was it hard for you to watch it later?Oh I love watching that scene. It’s so much fun. Somebody has it up on YouTube and I copied in and put it on my MySpace page.Are you at all like Ben in real life?Not too much. I mean I have my secrets. [laughs]I suppose it would be silly to ask what those secrets are.Yeah. And most of them are about the show. I’m curious — do you think Ben is alive?Well he grows up to become an adult so he must be — right?Ah. You think he becomes an adult. Now this is just from watching if you listen back to when the Losties first meet up with the Dharma people when Miles asked Daniel Faraday “Hey we don’t get involved right?” And Daniel Faraday says “It doesn’t matter now we’re stuck in this time we’re going to change something.” So they’re changing time. Don’t forget way back in season 2 we saw Ben without his shirt on and there was no scar.Are you becoming more recognizable at school for your television work?Not any more because I don’t go to regular school any more. Because “Lost” was going to take up so much time my school said you can’t miss that much you’re going to have to go to a home-school program.Do you like that as much as going to a regular school?I’m liking it. It’s a lot harder because you’re basically teaching yourself. That part’s hard about it.Is that how evil geniuses are created?I think it would be a good way.

0,We had a nice event at Princeton yesterday — the Graham lecture given this year by Jon Eaton — and later over drinks Jim Harrigan pointed me to an interesting paper by David Hummels and co-authors about international transportation. The interesting point is that for many countries/routes there isn’t a lot of competition: modern ships are big and many countries are small.Minimum efficient scale in shipping is significant. The capacity of a modern container ship is large relative to the export volumes produced by smaller countries and there are substantial economies of scope in offering transport services over a network of ports. One way to see this effect is to calculate the number of carriers operating on a particular trade route. In the fourth quarter 2006 one in six importer-exporter pairs world-wide was served by a single direct liner “service” meaning that only one ship was operating on that route. Over half of importer-exporter pairs were served by three or fewer ships and in many cases all of the ships on a route were owned by a single carrierI know it’s not world-shaking but I always think it’s interesting to get a sense of the physical reality of trade which is a lot less seamless than we tend to think.

1,The eldest child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy Joseph Jr. was set to enter his final year at Harvard Law School in 1943 but instead volunteered to serve as flier for the United States Navy in World War II.He was sent to England and died during a secret mission when an experimental aircraft loaded with explosives blew up over the English Channel.The family was together in Hyannis Port on a Sunday afternoon in August when two priests came with news of his death at age 29.“My father took the two men upstairs” Eunice Kennedy Shriver Joseph Jr.’s sister said later. “A little while later he came down and said ‘We’ve lost Joe.’”“Then he went back upstairs to his room and locked the door.”When Joe Jr. was born his grandfather Mayor John F. Fitzgerald of Boston announced to the news media that the newborn would become president someday.

0,To the Editor:Maureen Dowd (column Oct. 30) says ''After admitting recently that Saddam had no connection to 9/11 the president pounded his finger on his lectern on Tuesday while vowing to stay in Iraq and said 'We must never forget the lessons of Sept. 11.' ''I took the main lesson of 9/11 to be that terror and tyranny are to be tolerated nowhere or we will find it everywhere. A direct connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 is irrelevant. He was a genocidal supporter of world terrorism. We've deposed him; now we have to finish routing his supporters so that the Iraqi people can rebuild and live in freedom.LAURA ACKERMANNew York Oct. 30 2003

1,PhotoCervantes through Don Quixote provides this 407-year-old bit of inspiration for diving into a new year in turbulent consequential and complicated times:“For come tell me can there be anything more delightful than to see as it were here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and serpents and lizards and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in it while from the middle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: ‘Knight whosoever thou art who beholdest this dread lake if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;’ and then the knight almost ere the awful voice has ceased without stopping to consider without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing himself without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive armour commending himself to God and to his lady plunges into the midst of the boiling lake and when he little looks for it or knows what his fate is to be he finds himself among flowery meadows with which the Elysian fields are not to be compared.”It’s a passage that’s been in my head since I heard it recited in stentorian tones in the mid 1970s by the remarkable Sears R. Jayne a Brown University professor of comparative literature (emeritus for many years now) when I took his course in comparative Renaissance literature.It came in handy around 1995 when I was wooing the woman who is now my wife (I still have the aging sheet on which I typed it).This kind of exhortation feels right now as well whether your role in confronting global challenges and opportunities is as a scientist communicator inventor teacher student elected leader or simply human being.
0,Following are excerpts from remarks by Senators Bob Smith Republican of New Hampshire and Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont in the Senate debate yesterday on the nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general as recorded by The New York Times:Senator SmithI consider it an honor and a privilege to stand here today in support of the nomination of John Ashcroft to be attorney general of the United States. Contrary to some of the rhetoric we've been hearing on the other side everybody and I say everybody in this institution knows that he's one of the finest people who ever served here. He's a man of great religious faith and a moral man. And yet as you listen to this debate if it wasn't for the fact that it was so personally destructive and so vindictive it would be humorous. Here you have a man who served six years in the United States Senate served two terms as governor two terms as the attorney general of the State of Missouri and yet to hear the debate here he's anti-child he's anti-woman he's anti-black he's anti-gays anti-Catholic. What else can possible be said? One thing we can be certainly be sure of: the left knows how to play politics and they do it well and I commend them for it.Unfortunately though sometimes in politics you destroy unfairly the reputations of people who don't deserve it. And that's what offends me the most. And I'm not going to use the term anger but it does offend me that this kind of personal destruction has to be used.I recall the comments earlier in the debate today of Senator Leahy when he said that there are 280 million Americans with divergent ethnic backgrounds and political views. Well out of that 280 million Americans according to the left if there are any of those 280 million Americans who are conservative and happen to be pro-life or pro-gun they can't be attorney general. Now if they are pro-choice or if they are anti-gun then they can be. And I would again remind my colleagues that the vote on Janet Reno was 98 to nothing. I think most of us would on this side of the aisle would agree that her views and ours were quite different. But we supported her nomination because the president of the United States has a right to pick his or her cabinet and that's a fact.And I just want to say that some of the comments especially as a Catholic I just want to respond directly to this anti-Catholic charge. It's so outrageous. A man is -- I don't know how people can look in the mirror to be candid about it and do this this kind of personal destruction. John Ashcroft let me read the letter that I just received a copy of the letter that I just received from Senator Kennedy's own cardinal Cardinal Law. I'm going to read it into the record:''Dear Senator Ashcroft let me begin by expressing my deep dismay at the unfounded and scurrilous charge that you could possibly harbor anti-Catholic feelings. I was astounded to hear that anyone was making such a ridiculous accusation. From my time as bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau until today I have always found you to be a man of honor integrity and deep faith. I recall with great fondness the many opportunities we had to work together on many issues affecting the lives of the good people of the State of Missouri. In a particular way I recall how kind and thoughtful you were to invite me to address the cardinal's annual prayer breakfast on Jan. 9 1992 when you were serving as the governor of Missouri. On that same day you also honored me with an invitation to address the Governor's Leadership Forum on Faith and Values. College students then and now are beneficiaries of your generous love and concern for them and their futures. I do not recall that you made any distinction between black white Protestant Catholic or Jew in your desire to instill in them a love for their faith their families and one another as brothers and sisters in the human family. Let me assure you John of my prayers in asking God to bless you Janet the children and all whom you hold dear. And with warm regards I am sincerely yours in Christ Cardinal Law Bernard Law Archbishop of Boston.''

"He gets it then he goes. I know he doesn't feel real natural at the plate. But when you see it you see what he's capable of."The teams who are first and third in the American League in home runs lived up to their billing. All nine runs came on six homers.

7,More Than LandAnd land was not the half of it. There were the shipping interests which perhaps accounted for the newspaper's enthusiasm for the San•Pedro harbor and an annexation of Hawaii: the automotive interests (Goodyear Tire and Rubber) and road construction interests (Western Construction) and gravel and rock interests (Southern California Rock and Gravel Consolidated Rock Products) and oil interests (Royal Dutch Shell. Union Oil) which perhaps accounted for its disdain of mass transportation systems. The Times also helped to turn Southern California into one gigantic traffic circle from which there seems to be no egress under the thumb of smog.Not to mention the Santa Anita racetrack the Los Angeles Philharmonic the chief of police and the Republican Party.No wonder organized crime never had much of a chance in Los Angeles. The Chandlers and their various syndicates ran everything except the vice racket. No wonder a nonentity like Norris Poulson could be elected Mayor three times. Times political columnists decided who was electable. No wonder the Watts. riots came as such a surprise. The Times hadn't reported on the existence of Watts.Aficionados of modern journalism will be most interested in the last third of “Thinking Big” which is the story of how The Times changed itself after 1960 from a right‐wing parochial rag into one of the nation's finest newspapers from a sponsor of Norris Poulson to a sponsor of Tom Bradley. is also the fascinating story of the politics of culture of the reign of Dorothy (Buffy) Chandler over the institutions of spiritual uplift. And it usefully describes the new power elite of Los Angeles in which there are actually some Democrats and Jews.But I found myself absorbed in the early years. Every dynasty is started by some sort of bandit. General Otis certainly wrote like a bandit: “The apostles of disorder the missionaries of unrest the jawsmitbs of closed‐sho•p unionism the haters of honest industry the acquisitionists of other people's property the enviers of other people's prosperity the brawlers the larcenists the dynamiters the I.W.W.'s and the friends of raising the devil generally are flocking to the standards of Absalom. The air is incarnadined and made mephitic with their presence.”

1,Natalie Cole a buoyantly jazzy singer who became a million-selling Grammy Award-winning pop hitmaker with her 1975 debut album and went on to even greater popularity when she followed the example of her father Nat King Cole in interpreting pre-rock pop standards died on Thursday in Los Angeles. She was 65.The cause was “ongoing health issues” her family said. Ms. Cole had undergone a kidney transplant in 2009 and had suffered from other ailments recently forcing the cancellation of tour dates in November and December.Ms. Cole had a light supple perpetually optimistic voice full of syncopated turns and airborne swoops drawing on both the nuances of jazz singing and the dynamics of gospel. It brought her million-selling albums in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s as she moved from the sound of her own generation to that of her parents.“The biggest similarities between Ms. Cole and her father are in attitude. Instead of working toward catharsis they aspire to a genteel elegance balance and good feeling” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times in 1993. “But where the ultimate direction of the father’s singing was an easy chair on a moonlit porch his daughter’s tenser more brittle singing evokes an urban indoor setting. To the decorous phrasing of a big band singer she brings a steady current of soul-music sassiness.”
0,The freshman wide receiver Josh Jarboe was dismissed Friday from the Oklahoma football team just three days after a crude Internet video surfaced that showed him freestyle rapping about guns shooting people and having sex.The Tulsa World first reported Jarboe’s dismissal after his Friday morning meeting with Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops.“We are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and the final decision is in the best interest of the program” Stoops said in a statement. “We outlined for Josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met. Josh needs to learn from this experience. We hope he can move forward in a positive manner.”The 74-second video of Jarboe rapping was posted Tuesday on the Oklahoma fan site Reddirtkings.com after previously showing up on YouTube. In May the 6-foot-3 195-pound Jarboe pleaded guilty to bringing a gun to Ellenwood (Ga.) Cedar Grove High School and carrying a pistol without a license. The charges were originally felonies but they were reduced to misdemeanors.Jarboe who was rated among the Class of 2008’s top 10 wide receivers by Rivals.com was sentenced to two years of probation and 80 hours of community service but was still allowed to enroll at Oklahoma. He signed with the Sooners in February and was arrested the next month.The timing of Jarboe’s dismissal is interesting because Stoops told The Oklahoman columnist Berry Tramel on Thursday that he wouldn’t kick Jarboe off the team for his video.“We’re starting to talk about everything kids say and do” Stoops told Tramel. “Now we’re in people’s homes in their private spaces.”Despite Stoops’s initial reticence to dismiss him someone apparently didn’t want an encore from Jarboe.

9,Although he is the Mayor of this valley idyll in the Cape wine country Frank Arendse does not quite live here. He lives down the road in the mixed-race or "colored" township called Groendal beyond the antique shops and the food boutiques where the road turns from asphalt to red mud.Mr. Arendse whose forebears include an English soldier and a slave from Madagascar is the first nonwhite Mayor to preside over a white jurisdiction in modern South Africa.In 1985 an American anthropologist chose this hamlet disguised under the pseudonymn "Wyndal" to conduct a study of South African whites. They emerged as comfortable and self-absorbed racists. Mr. Arendse says that his selection as Mayor is a great responsibility and an opportunity to get the roads paved on his side of town. It is not he fears a sign that rural South Africa has suddenly gone colorblind. A Merging of 2 TownsHe became Mayor last month after the adjoining towns were merged into a single municipality embracing about 3000 people of mixed race 500 blacks and 1200 whites. The powerless advisory committee that had previously represented the mixed-race majority before the whites-only city council was absorbed into the council pending an election. Two white council members crossed over to elect Mr. Arense Mayor 8 to 4 which means he has the tie-breaking vote in governing the town.

1,PhotoRead in Chinese | 点击查看本文中文版We’re in Beijing — no Beiping — Dec. 10 1979. It’s year two of the presidency of Chiang Ching-kuo son of Chiang Kai-shek. China has been an American ally since Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang or Nationalist forces defeated Mao’s Communists in the civil war that ended in 1949. The Chinese capital is still Nanjing. The Dalai Lama remains in Lhasa. Hong Kong is a British colonial backwater. China is prosperous.PhotoIt’s also repressive. Opposition parties are at most decorative; human rights advocates are hunted down. But in the 30 years since the war after which the Communists scattered abroad many to the Soviet Union China has followed a path that diverges sharply from the history we know today. No class struggle no purge of landlords no Anti-Rightist campaign against intellectuals no Great Leap Forward or the catastrophic famine that followed no Cultural Revolution. The progress achieved in education and civil society under the Nationalists from 1911 to 1949 has continued.Welcome to Chan Koonchung’s alternative history novel “The Second Year of Jianfeng” recently published in Chinese in Hong Kong. (It is not yet been translated into English.) Jianfeng was the courtesy name for Chiang Ching-kuo which Mr. Chan imagines as the name for his rule. In an interview Mr. Chan addressed the central question of his book: What if China had not gone Communist?Q.Could things have been different?A.The Chinese Communist Party insists that “history has chosen the C.C.P.” and without the party there would be no strong and prosperous new China. I want to show the possibility that China could have become strong and prosperous much much earlier.History is not “determined” and is not as inevitable as Communist dogma would like us to believe.The first 30 years of Communist rule under Mao Zedong before Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms were a total waste of time an unnecessary historical detour with an unspeakably immense humanitarian cost.Q.Would China have been better off if the Nationalists had won the civil war?PhotoA.China would definitely have been a nicer place. It would still have had things that were wrong but much less than what actually happened. Such as there wouldn’t have been a Cultural Revolution.There are some things the Nationalists would have done worse. For example they were more tied to the triads. But I think that by 1979 the Nationalists would have achieved something very similar to what the Communists are achieving now 37 years later but with more equality in society.Q.How difficult was it for you to construct an alternative history for China?A.I thought it would be very difficult but it turned out much easier than I thought. It took less than a year to write though I spent a lot of time preparing for it. I had to think how would the Kuomintang have ruled? For that I had to think about the Taiwan elite as it was.I picked several real people to tell the story. One was Zhang Dongsun [a philosopher and democrat who declined to take sides between the Communist and Nationalists and died in prison in Beijing in 1973]. I took the actual words they said and put them into different contexts.Q.How did you envision the alternative reality?A.I wasn’t aiming to make a utopia out of China. But maybe because of the success in Taiwan I can say that they would have done something similar to that.Of course the U.S. and China would have been allies from the very start. The coastal cities of China would have boomed from 1949 on because the U.S. was the big economy at the time so whoever could export to the U.S. had a boom.In Taiwan after 1949 the Kuomintang did carry out land reform so I speculated that they would also have done that in China. It was very successful in Taiwan and the reason is it was nonviolent and cooperative. Landlords were made shareholders in state-owned companies and given loans. They turned into capitalists and promoted industry.Industrialization took off after that. If they had done something similar in China it would have been great. The Communists did it differently. They used class struggle and killed off the old owners.There would still have been a Korean War because Kim Il-sung was very ambitious and believed he could conquer South Korea in a few days.Q.How would Chinese culture have fared?A.In 1968 [in the book the novelist] Lao She becomes the first Chinese writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature while in real life he was pushed to commit suicide [in 1966] during the Cultural Revolution. Old temples antiques and historic sites might simply have been neglected instead of willfully destroyed by the Red Guards as happened in reality.Q.Are alternative history novels demanding on the reader?A.I didn’t explain a lot. I depended on my readers’ understanding of Chinese contemporary history to make comparisons and to enjoy reading between the lines.Follow Didi Kirsten Tatlow on Twitter @dktatlow.

9,With property insurance companies facing worse-than-expected claims from the California earthquake the industry is signaling homeowners that they can expect higher premiums tougher guidelines on what will be insured and fewer companies offering earthquake policies.Steve Young director of a trade group representing insurance agents and brokers said the desire of insurance companies to limit their exposure to future earthquake losses was "a crisis in the making for California insurance consumers." In the months since the January earthquake more and more California property owners have been trying to buy earthquake insurance.So far only one company -- Twentieth Century Insurance the eighth- largest home insurer in the state -- has applied to the state for an emergency rate increase. The company wants to double or triple the cost of earthquake insurance to $4 or $6 per $1000 of coverage up from $2 currently while maintaining a a deductible that requires homeowners to pay for damages up to 10 percent of the insured value of property. Loss Exceeds EstimateRichard A. Dinon senior vice president at Twentieth Century noted that its earthquake claims totaled about $600 million or more than four times what it estimated its maximum loss could be from a huge quake. After losing nearly half its capital which serves as a cushion to absorb unexpected losses Twentieth Century says it needs higher prices to accumulate profits so that it can pay claims from the next major earthquake.

8,''I've never been number oriented'' he said. ''I don't believe in saying this game ranks first or that game ranks second. But there have been several games that I could roll into a ball so to speak as the most meaningful of my career.''Quickly he mentioned four games early in his Met career.''The game against the Cubs at Shea in 1969 when I had a no-hitter going into the ninth. The game I struck out 19 against San Diego in 1970 and another game in 1970 in Los Angeles when I struck out 16 in 12 innings before I went out with the score 1-1. And the game in 1969 when I won 20 games for the first time that always stays with you.''Almost a year to the day after being traded to the Reds he pitched a 4-0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals.''I didn't have great stuff that night but I had some great plays behind me'' he said. ''And whenever I got hit hard it was right at somebody.''For all his victories Tom Seaver didn't start thinking about winning 300 until last year.''When I came back to the Mets after having had a sore shoulder in 1982 with the Reds I didn't know if I'd ever pitch again'' he said. ''But then I pitched pretty well in 1983 and then when I continued to pitch well with the White Sox last year I realized that I was getting close. I knew another good year would get me there.''With an 11-8 record this season he has one more start before Tuesday's strike deadline.''I'm not trying to beat the strike'' Tom Seaver said. ''I'm going to get 300 anyway.''He should be getting it for the Mets and if he were maybe the Mets would have won the National League East last year maybe they would be in first place now. But the reason he's with the White Sox goes back to 1966 when Roland Hemond now the White Sox general manager was the California Angels' scouting director.

0,KABUL — I was one of the hundreds of young photojournalists who came to this distant country in 2001 to photograph my first war; naïve a little reckless and mostly unprepared. At the time the Taliban ruled most of the country. Only a thin slice of mountainous territory in the north between Tajikistan and the Panjshir Valley was controlled by the opposition the Northern Alliance. My travel companions were Matthew McAllester who was then a foreign correspondent for Newsday and Tyler Hicks a photographer for The New York Times.Moises SamanWe rented a Soviet vehicle with four-wheel drive on the Tajikistan border driven by an Afghan who was chain-smoking hashish and journeyed south towards the front lines that were just north of Kabul. As we traversed this rugged country we seemed to be traveling back in time. Small roads deep gorges and ragtag people one wearing sunglasses with a lens missing others missing an arm or leg; homemade checkpoints of just a rope stretched across the road. No electricity no telephones no Internet. Pitch black at night the stars the brightest I had ever seen.Moises SamanThe Afghanistan I know is a land of clashing contrasts of raw beauty; its landscape scarred by centuries of wars fought against foreign armies and with itself. Since 2001 I have returned over and over again with the hope of documenting the promise of peace and prosperity made by the latest invading powers. I soon realized the fragility of this promise and found Afghanistan staring at a precipice its free fall toward anarchy gaining strength throughout the country no longer confined to the Pashto-speaking provinces where the Taliban was born and remains entrenched.The deteriorating security situation is evident all around me on each subsequent visit. One less safe road to travel on a labyrinth of blast walls surrounding Kabul the hostile stare of an innocent child. For the local population peace and stability have become a fleeting dream not a sustainable promise in which their sense of hope finds refuge. Still I continue to find myself drawn to this remarkable place and its people to their unmatched sense of pride on being Afghan and the hint of dignity and spirit that I find in most of the people I meet here determined to carry on — however battered their existence.Moises SamanThis series of photographs represents Moises Saman‘s personal journey through Afghanistan witnessing the devastation of the country. Some of these pictures appeared in “Afghanistan: Broken Promise” (Charta 2007) by Mr. Saman with text by Rory Stewart.

1,Melinda Gates will be traveling shortly to Bangladesh to look at maternal health child health and women’s issues (including family planning and reproductive health) — and she has agreed to answer your questions about these topics while she’s there. So please post your questions for Melinda and me about these issues in the comments below and we’ll choose some and give you our best answers.Why these topics? They’re among the most important challenges we face. Women continue to die needlessly in childbirth especially in Africa and South Asia when we know exactly how to save their lives. And infant mortality — especially neo-natal deaths — remain a huge problem in many countries. As for empowering women this isn’t just about justice; it’s also often the most cost-effective way to save lives and benefit entire societies. These are issues that Melinda and the Gates Foundation have thought long and hard about and that I’ve tried to popularize in my column and on Twitter and my Facebook page (and of course in “Half the Sky”).I also have lots of admiration for Bill and Melinda Gates. Until relatively recently philanthropy tended to be about supporting art museums universities and the symphony — all worthy causes but also ones that disproportionately benefit those who are already better off. And much of that giving seems to me to be about networking raising one’s own status or getting one’s grandchildren into the right university. Bill and Melinda helped refocus attention on the world’s neediest citizens and they also brought a tough-minded business-like focus on measurement metrics and getting the most bang for the buck while saving lives. That’s as important as the amount of money they’ve thrown at development problems.So post questions below for Melinda and me. Tough skeptical questions welcome.

7,SATURDAY. SEPTEMBER 3 1977Malaysia's attitude to Vietnamese seeking refuge in the country has softened. American diplomats say this has followed President Carter's decision to admit 15000 refugees from Indochina and the offer of other Western countries to take some in. Thailand and especially Malaysia are not so fearful now that they will be permanently burdened. Malaysia no longer pushes the “boat people” back out to sea. Of the 8000 refugees in transit camps from Japan to Indochina 3000 are in Malaysia. Only Western nations have offered asylum to the wanderers. No Asian nation has acknowledged an obligation to give permanent asylum. [Page 1 Columns 2‐4.]•The latest British‐American proposals for a Rhodesian settlement are “mad” “crazy” and ‘insane” Prime Minister Ian D. Smith said in a television news conference in Salisbury. He stopped short of an outright rejection however and said that his Government would give the proposals serious consideration before responding possibly with Counterproposals. [3:6.]•Rumania's human rights movement appears to have been crushed completely. President Nicolae Ceausescu has succeeded in eliminating visible dissent with comparatively little punitive action. Paul Goma the novelist who was the movement's leader has been silenced as have been hundreds of others who only five months ago were signing petitions appealing for support from International organizations and even staging modest demonstrations. Mr. Goma has been put to work in the National Library in Bucharest and he and his famliy have been given a new apartment but no telephone. [3:1‐2.]A rise in the unemployment rate in August of two‐tenths of a percentage point to 7.1 percent of the total labor force was reported by the Labor Department. Almost all of the increase the department said was concentrated among blacks. Civil rights leaders asserted that the new figures confirmed charges made by black leaders that the Administration had neglected blacks the poor and the cities. [1:6.]
9,''The United States'' he said ''must launch a genuine plan for the Andes not just a laundry list of disjointed initiatives.''The Administration's response is that the problem of cocaine smuggling from Latin America has been building since the early 1970's and that it will take time to solve. ''We can show some little successes but over all it's going to take several years'' said a United States official in Peru. ''We're just getting into the ballgame just starting to get the resources we need.''Some Administration officials working on drug issues in Washington say they do not expect to see any measurable effect on the flow of cocaine into the United States until late 1990. ''That's just a realistic assessment of how long it takes government to work'' one said.Some Bush aides acknowledged that the Panama invasion has not been a plus for the drug war and one said it was ''catastrophically negative'' and indicated that Washington was holding out hope that Peru would ultimately decide to join in the Andean summit meeting now that it has resumed its anti-drug program with the United States. Colombia One Kingpin Down But Many to Go One of the most notable successes in the drug fight came in mid-December when Colombian security forces chased down and killed Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha a powerful and violent leader of the Medellin cartel which controls much of the world cocaine market. It was a major accomplishment for Colombia and it bolstered public support after drug bosses had repeatedly escaped police raids and terrorized the capital Bogota with nightly bombings.In the last two weeks drug terrorism has dropped significantly. And there is some evidence that drug-ring leaders are now fighting each other. But the American and Colombian authorities say Mr. Rodriguez Gacha's death will have little effect on the export of cocaine because someone will win the battle to succeed him and simply pick up the slack.And Colombian traffickers who control most of the cocaine industry worldwide are moving their jungle factories where paste from the the coca leaf is processed into powder. The refineries are being set up in Peru and Bolivia and even along the frontiers of Brazil and Ecuador which until now had been relatively free of drug traffic.Scores of smaller Colombian drug processers and shippers and some of the major traffickers who have operated quietly and without violence have been left alone by the Government. Should the level of terrorism remain low for an extended period some Colombian experts predict the Government will declare victory and permit the peaceful drug traffickers to go about their business.

2,|SENATE GOLF CLUB MUM ABOUT MEMBERS; Some Do Not Want Their Constituents to Know That TheyPlay on Sundays.
1,CBGB was like a witch’s house with its stucco exterior swinging wooden doors and opaque windows smeared with layers of fliers and wheat-paste residue. We walked in and I was entering the dreams I envisioned from the pages of Rock Scene which included the row of beer signs hanging from the ceiling leading to the stage. It was $3 to enter which at that time was fairly steep at least for teenagers from Connecticut with just enough coin from lawn-mowing jobs to pay for gas cigs and a few Cokes. We were out of money and wondering how to get in when I noticed Richard Hell hanging around the door. I asked him if he could help. He had a stamp on his hand and licked it and pressed it on ours and we slinked in.We slowly moved toward the front all new terrain for us and suddenly a beer bottle came flying at high speed from across the room whizzed right past my head and crashed into the wall behind the bar. And no one reacted! We found a seat and watched as a couple of cats and a dog named Jonathan moved through the audience and on and off the stage. People were eating hamburgers and smoking in the midst of the coolest place on Earth. The Mumps came on and there was the lead singer Lance Loud dancing like a madman with the remarkable Kristian Hoffman on keyboards. And then Blondie played and it was beyond great with Debbie Harry karate-kicking the audience and Gary Valentine bopping in dark shades.Over time I realized that not all the bands at CBGB were amazing. There were definitely some duds a lot of faded stardust with yesterday’s shag haircut but signals were changing. What struck me the most was the sheer bloody-mindedness of the artists poets filmmakers and musicians who were rubbing up against one another there. Whatever glamour there was on that stage many of the artists were basically subsisting at poverty level. Fame had little to do with money which the club infamously paid little of. But being there felt like you were at ground zero of the most critical listening room of the future.CBGB was our university. We all met each other in 1976 and some of us — Jim Jarmusch Lydia Lunch Jean-Michel Basquiat Kathy Acker Glenn Branca et al. — realized immediately that our devotion was decided. By the end of the year I’d be playing in the Coachmen an art school band from the Rhode Island School of Design informed by the college mates Talking Heads né the Artistics/Autistics. By springtime ’77 I had my $115-a-month pad on 13th Street between Avenues A and B. When Sonic Youth came together in late 1980 I asked Hilly Kristal the proprietor of CBGB if we could play there. He recognized me from being this kid who basically lived at his club since late ’76 and said “Of course you can.” He became a champion to me always letting me present the band there in any context. When people ask me how I tune my guitar I always say CBGB.

9,Sent to HiroshimaProfessor Fujita who will continue his research at the university was born in Kitakyushu Japan. He studied sunspot movements as a teen-ager and remembers his father telling him to get down from the roof during a typhoon.In 1945 when he was an assistant professor of physics at Meiji College of Technology in Japan he was sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to examine the nature and number of atomic bombs used. ''It was a dangerous game walking around three weeks after the bomb'' he said.The experience served him well 30 years later however when he was asked to help find the reasons for an Eastern Airlines crash at Kennedy International Airport. He discovered that during a severe storm violent gusts of air can move straight down crushing houses and trees and making it impossible for planes to fly. Air he found would ''hit the ground very hard'' and spread out not unlike the shock-wave patterns at Hiroshima and Nagasaki which moved from ground zero outward.Although this theory of downbursts and microbursts was initially disputed Professor Fujita installed Doppler radar at three Chicago area airports and was able to document his findings. Now the Federal Aviation Administration is capitalizing on them with the widespread use of Doppler radar which allows observers to measure the speed of moving objects including wind.Tornado Teaching ToolTornadoes are Professor Fujita's other passion at Chicago. He devised a widely-used system for measuring their strength known as the Fujita Tornado Scale and he has studied and photographed their effects.

8,In three years as president of the University of Maine Dale W. Lick has heard his share of criticism but none stronger than that unleashed this week after he said research showed that black athletes perform better than whites because they are better suited genetically for certain sports.Dr. Lick was asked at a student senate meeting Tuesday why there was a high percentage of minority athletes only in football and basketball at the school. According to a transcript of the conversation Dr. Lick replied: ''A black athlete can actually outjump a white athlete on the average so they're better at that game. The same is true for football. The muscle structure of the black athlete typically is more suited for certain positions in football and in basketball. Now this isn't me talking this is what the research shows.''Mr. Lick was immediately criticized by students faculty members state officials and the chancellor of the state university system. They said the statement was at the very least insensitive and showed poor judgment by the head of the state's main campus in Orono. No Derogatory IntentionMr. Lick who is 51 years old and has a doctorate in mathematics said later that he ''certainly didn't mean in any way to be derogatory or discriminatory at all.''
8,She realizes now she said that what she thought at the age of 13 - that the father would stay around that they could hold together a family - was largely irrational. ''I was a little child but I didn't look like 13'' she said. ''I had a body like I was older I did talk to everyone as though I was older.''She said she did not use birth control before her first pregnancy. Afterward she took the pill but ''I didn't take it right.''She would get together with her boyfriend - ''he always wanted to be the best guy around the block'' - when his mother was out of her apartment. ''She would go with her boyfriend and I would go to her house with her son'' Ms. Collado recalled. ''He had a five-room apartment. It was real nice we had something going.''She said she would usually leave his house by 9 P.M. so she could get back before her mother then a nurse's aide came home from work.When Ms. Collado delivered her first child her mother left work to look after him and later the second child. ''She had to stop to look after the kids'' Ms. Collado said. ''Now she has arthritis. My mother gets welfare for me my sister and the two babies. When I get home from school I do my mother's job of looking after the kids.''Around her neighborhood in the north Bronx she sees little changing among her friends.''Basically the whole block is all young girls with kids'' she said. ''They're all young 14 or 15. The oldest one is my best friend she's 17 with a 1-year-old. She did it to get out of the house. The youngest girls sleep with anybody they can get. To me they want to be like everybody else. Some of the girls say: 'I slept with this guy.' It's like they did something real big. They're just wasting their time. Who's going to want them?'' Motherhood Gives 'A Reason for Living'Like Roseann Collado Sherri Woodford a 19-year-old student at West Side High School an alternative school in Manhattan said she became pregnant on purpose hoping that she could transform a tumultuous home life.

8,''As soon as I heard the record I caught the songwriting fever once and for all and decided I belonged on Tin Pan Alley - you couldn't tear me away from the profession after that'' he said.Mr. Parish estimates he collaborated with at least a hundred different composers over the years. Though his writing techniques have varied from situation to situation his approach toward lyrics has been quick and intuitive.''In many cases I was given both a tune and a title'' he said. ''Sometimes I would write a 'dummy' lyric with words that didn't mean anything in order to get the rhythmic flow. Then I would come up with the actual words. Occasionally a dummy lyric ends up being the final lyric. Irving Caesar's 'Tea for Two' is a famous example.''Once I had a title I would take it home walk around with it for awhile to let it percolate and then sit down to write. The actual writing time was usually a half hour to an hour. I didn't believe in laboring over a lyric too much because the song would sound too worked over.''Mr. Parish found working with a predetermined title to be a nuisance albeit one that sometimes yielded artistic dividends. In the lyrics of both ''Star Dust'' and ''Sophisticated Lady'' the actual song titles aren't repeated in the catch phrases of the chorus but occur almost incidentally in the narrative helping to sustain the smooth natural flow of imagery. The lyric of ''Star Dust'' is especially striking in the way the verse seems to begin in the middle of a thought: ''. . .And now the purple dust of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart.''The history of ''Star Dust'' illustrates Mr. Parish's belief that songs that are overnight sensations tend to be quickly forgotten while those that come to be recognized as standards often have a longer quieter gestation in the public consciousness.Hoagy Carmichael wrote and recorded the melody for ''Star Dust'' in 1927 as a jazz instrumental heavily influenced by Bix Beiderbecke. Mr. Parish wrote the lyric in 1929 and it became a hit the following year in a recording by Isham Jones the tenor saxophonist bandleader and songwriter (''I'll See You in My Dreams'' ''It Had to Be You'') who led one of the most popular orchestras of the pre-swing era. The following year Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong also had minor hit versions of the song.
0,Several hundred leading figures from the government business and nonprofit realms gathered at the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown today for a discussion about New York City’s future organized by the Manhattan Institute a conservative policy research organization.The Manhattan Institute which publishes a quarterly magazine called City Journal wielded far more influence over the Giuliani administration than it has over the current mayor Michael R. Bloomberg so today’s discussion — which began with a keynote address by the mayor — represented a bit of a rapprochement between the mayor and the institute.But the conference also had an unusually laudatory tone. At one point Mr. Bloomberg was compared to the pope who called the Second Vatican Council. At another point a leading historian commented aloud — after Mr. Bloomberg had left the room — that Mr. Bloomberg might well be seen as the greatest mayor ever.The moderator Julia Vitullo-Martin a senior fellow at the institute set the favorable tone with her introductory remarks recalling the turmoil of the 2001 election:Many lifelong Democrats decided to vote for a man who they thought would have a calming influence on New York after 9/11 who could manage the city very well and who would be an excellent caretaker. In retrospect this looks like the College of Cardinals in 1958 when they elected Angelo Roncalli Pope John XXIII. Michael Bloomberg has been for us a revolutionary John XXIII. He has been a superb caretaker of the things in the city that were doing well. He’s built on Mayor Giuliani’s magnificent crime program.Ms. Vitullo-Martin did not only gush. She noted that London began to intensify its competition with New York around 2003 and that Mayor Bloomberg had only 791 days left in his term.Mr. Bloomberg gave a speech that focused on land use and the modernization of the city’s building and zoning codes but he began with a joke: “No matter how exciting or challenging any other position might be I plan to stay as mayor for the next 791 days and the Yankees are just going to have to look elsewheres for another third baseman.”The mayor in a conciliatory tone said the Manhattan Institute had been particularly effective in the area of public safety “and got it exactly right when it argued that low crime was essential” to the city’s recovery.The mayor turned somewhat boastful as he often has in his major policy addresses. “Not only has the ungovernable city become governable again; we’ve reclaimed our title as the greatest city on earth” he said. (Wallace S. Sayre and Herbert Kaufman famously described the city as “ungovernable” in a 1960 book “Governing New York City.” More than 40 yearse later “The Ungovernable City” was the title of Vincent J. Cannato’s 2001 biography of Mayor John V. Lindsay.)Despite the mayor’s recent calls for fiscal belt-tightening Mr. Bloomberg sounded an optimistic tone. “We may be headed for a national economic slowdown but New York City has never been better prepared to weather one than we are right now” the mayor said.Mr. Bloomberg left the Republican Party earlier this year and declared himself an independent but he sounded a message that resonated with his conservative hosts when he said that “we needed to completely rethink the regulations governing the way we use land in this city.”He talked about modernizing the city’s building code adopted in 1968 and zoning resolution adopted in 1961 and streamlining the environmental reviews that accompany major projects — reviews that “can be lengthy painful and expensive disincentives to development” he said.At the same time Mr. Bloomberg maintained that his administration did not favor the “autocratic urban planning” of the Robert Moses era. Instead he said the city had involved various communities for strategic rezoning plans in neighborhoods like Jamaica Queens. He predicted that Flushing and Long Island City in Queens Downtown Brooklyn and West Chelsea in Manhattan would be the next big growth areas.Mr. Bloomberg closed his address by saying of New York City: “It is going to get greater. Don’t listen to the naysayers.”Next to speak was Kenneth T. Jackson the Columbia University historian who edited The Encyclopedia of New York City. Professor Jackson walked through some of the most momentous dates in the city’s history: the English capture of New York in 1664 the adoption of the street grid system in 1811 the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 the opening of the Croton Aqueduct in 1842 the consolidation of greater New York in 1898 the enactment of the tenement house law of 1901 the start of the subway system in 1904 the adoption of comprehensive zoning in 1916 the building of Rockefeller Center in the 1920s and ’30s and the city’s rescue by the Municipal Assistance Corporation in the 1970s.He said the “fundamental character” of New York could be boiled down to its diversity (dating from the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam where 18 languages were already spoken in the 1630s) its tradition of toleration (dating from the Flushing Remonstrance of 1657 which established a pattern of religious freedom) its density (approximately twice that of Chicago) and its “ability to change and face the future with confidence and hope.”But Professor Jackson also urged the city not to get stuck in its past. “I would suggest that we are in competition with Tokyo and Shanghai and Beijing and Seoul and London to be the greatest city in the world — not with Boston or Philadelphia or Newport or Charleston to be the place with the most historic structures and the most gracious streets. As Mayor Bloomberg said we need to plan for the decades to come. We need to be open to change.”Provocatively Professor Jackson speculated that three of the city’s mayors this century could be viewed as great — Fiorello H. La Guardia Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani — but added “It may not be too early to say that Mayor Bloomberg will one day be remembered as the greatest New York City has ever had.”The other speakers were Amanda M. Burden chairwoman of the City Planning Commission and Felix G. Rohatyn the financier and investment bank who in the 1970s led the Municipal Assistance Corporation the entity that helped rescue New York from its fiscal nadir.Ms. Burden discussed plans for reshaping Flatbush Avenue Coney Island the South Bronx and other sections of the city. Mr. Rohatyn recalled the challenges of the ’70s but also spoke of broader economic challenges today:I think that competition is going to be fierce because cities which are almost countries all over the world are becoming huge — producing creating enormous amounts of capital. They will be very competitive with labor as cheap as it is. The influence of foreign capital is going to continue enormously strongly but the position of the city is going to depend to some extent on the ability of our national government to maintain the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. Because if we lose that position some of these other positions may erode.He said he did not expect that to happen but worried about it nonetheless.

1,Vine ConnectionsI picked up a lot of fascinating stories while I was reporting this week’s article about sake.I heard about sake made in an igloo.I heard about sake made with a type of rice that’s so difficult to cultivate and so vulnerable to the elements that it had nearly disappeared in Japan — until the heir to the Huchu Homare brewery managed to secure 14 grams of freeze-dried seedlings from a government “gene bank.”I heard about one sake Kuro Kabuto that’s made with an unusual strain of black mold. “They say the black mold when looked at through a microscope resembles the helmet that samurai used to wear in battle” Johnnie Stroud the owner of a Seattle shop and tasting bar called Sake Nomi told me. “Some of our regulars have renamed it the Darth Vader of sake.”I even learned about sake that’s made with music. In “The Sake Handbook” a comprehensive guide by rice-wine guru John Gauntner the author devotes a page to a brew called Nagaragawa. “This small kura has about twenty stereo speakers that play music and natural sounds around the fermenting tanks twenty-four hours a day” he writes. “Does it help? Try Nagaragawa and see.”But not all great rice wines have the makings of a Madison Square Garden concert or a Hollywood screenplay. Some are simply delicious to drink.A few days ago I went downtown to a restaurant called Robataya on East Ninth Street to meet manager Hisaya Kadoi one of New York’s true sake connoisseurs. He told me that sake goes well with the grilled salted dishes that Robataya serves. “The simplest food” he said “with the simplest drink.”Mr. Kadoi 41 is a strikingly gentle man. It was clear that he wanted me to try the best and most expensive sake on Robataya’s menu the Kokuryu Ishidaya and yet he was too polite to insist.He sells a bottle of it for $380. A single glass goes for $54.The restaurant’s menu describes it as “a stunning revelation at first sip with a deep rolling tsunami of flavors.” Still we all have budgets to contend with.“I ask the waiters” he told me. “Nobody gets the $54 glass.”But Mr. Kadoi is so passionate about making this rarity accessible to the full range of his customers that he has begun offering a smaller “tasting size” of the Kokuryu Ishidaya for $27. “Normally it’s not served by the glass” he said. “I want to give everyone the chance to drink this amazing sake.”At that price I couldn’t resist. It was late in the afternoon past the lunch hour and the restaurant was quiet. Mr. Kadoi got up from the table and came back with a shiny black box. He opened the box and slowly lifted out a blue bottle. He set down two glasses pouring a few small swigs of sake into mine and then into his own. “When I tried this sake for the first time I thought ‘I can drink the whole bottle because it’s so smooth’ ” Mr. Kadoi said.He lifted the glass to his nose and held it there awhile.“Kanpai” he said in almost a whisper. Then a sip.He remained silent for a long time and all we could hear was the burbling of a stone-bowl fountain.

0,After weeks of opposition by state lawmakers and local officials Gov. George E. Pataki today retreated from his proposal to bill local governments for half the costs of property tax breaks offered to businesses in state economic development zones.Mr. Pataki a Republican made the proposal in his executive budget last month saying that it would save the state about $4 million annually. Currently the state pays $250 million every year to local governments to cover the cost of a variety of tax breaks in 72 specially designated Empire Zones across the state.But the Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver a Democrat and the Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno a Republican opposed the change. This week Mr. Bruno proposed expanding the program by adding 18 more zones mostly in counties that have none.Many state and local government officials also lobbied against Mr. Pataki's plan saying it would not only cost local governments money but would also discourage them from participating in one of the state's most successful economic development programs.

9,Manager Bud Harrelson in an effort to end a personal dispute between center fielder Vince Coleman and third- base coach Mike Cubbage as well as short-circuit what he contended were overheated reports of the affair today reversed his approach and held a closed meeting with the principals."Your articles changed my mind" Harrelson told reporters after he met with Coleman and Cubbage for 15 minutes before tonight's game against the Dodgers.Harrelson who on Tuesday said he saw no reason to discipline or speak to Coleman about the player's verbal assault on the coach in San Diego last Friday said he had spoken today about the incident with Al Harazin the executive vice president of the Mets. Then Harrelson while insisting that Harazin had in no way directed him to do anything called Coleman and Cubbage into his office upon their arrival at Dodger Stadium."It's resolved and that's all you are going to get from me" Harrelson told reporters.Coleman who was scratched from the lineup tonight because his injured hamstring tightened refused to say whether he had apologized to Cubbage but agreed that the matter was closed.

0,Traditional terra cotta tagines have no glazing on the underside of the lid to allow evaporating steam to be absorbed by the clay and concentrate the sauce. Now new ones from Tangiers Morocco are completely glazed but accomplish the same purpose with a tiny air vent for the escaping steam. They are also sturdier and have ridges in the dish to prevent food from sticking. The drawback is that the evaporation can happen too rapidly. ''Moroccan cooks put a sprig of thyme in the hole to reduce it'' said Kim Koenig-Ouassil above with her husband Rachid Ouassil. The couple sell the tagines at their Moroccan store Sheherazade. They are $35 $45 and $55. The small size holds food for four. Sheherazade which also sells decorative tagines used only for serving is at 121 Orchard Street (Delancey Street) on the Lower East Side.

1,It’s always been easy to admire Susan Choi’s novels especially “American Woman” (2003) loosely based on the Patty Hearst kidnapping and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. It’s been harder to love them. She’s so poised on the page so reserved that distance can slip between teller and tale.Choi’s new novel her fifth is titled “Trust Exercise” and it burns more brightly than anything she’s yet written. This psychologically acute novel enlists your heart as well as your mind. Zing will go certain taut strings in your chest.They did in mine at any rate. Perhaps this is because “Trust Exercise” is a densely imagined high school novel and like most of her central characters I graduated from high school in the early 1980s. Choi gets the details right: the mix tapes the perms the smokers’ courtyards the “Cats” sweatshirts the clove cigarettes the ballet flats worn with jeans the screenings of “Rocky Horror” the clinking bottles of Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers.These things do not explain this novel’s appeal. “Trust Exercise” is set at a performing arts high school in a large Southern city (it appears to be Houston) yet it is hardly a chicken-fried “Fame.”

9,New York City will sing "Happy Birthday" to Jimmy Connors tomorrow night on the Stadium Court of the National Tennis Center.It will be his 40th and what a coincidence that his first-round match with Jaime Oncins of Brazil happened to fall on it."It was fortunate for us that he ended up in the half of the draw that would play Tuesday or Wednesday" said Tom Barnes the Open referee. Once that happened as Barnes said giving Connors his first-round birthday bash was "a no-brainer."He added "What would you do?"Even the Open which Jimbo ruled last year when he rolled like Old Man River into the semifinals did not go so far as to extend the first round over three days just to accommodate Connors. That's Entertainment
9,His committee spent far too much time early in the hearings proving points that were not in dispute.Senator Thompson and his staff also proved to be inept at stage management. Before the public sessions started he told every interviewer that one of his main tasks was to put on a good show so that people would pay attention but he never did so.The committee's lawyers questioned witnesses endlessly on minor points. The committee's senators spent day after day delivering monologues serially rather than questioning witnesses. And testimony compelling enough to interest the television networks was often offered at times when it was not convenient for the networks to broadcast it.On the question of exposing the flaws in the campaign finance system Senator Thompson contends with some justification that the attention generated by his investigation was a factor in the agreement by Republican leaders to allow votes next March on changes in the campaign finance law.''We've had the first real substantive debate on campaign finance reform in 20 years'' Senator Thompson said today. ''We played a part in that and I'm proud.''But he and the other senators from both parties were never willing to address squarely the fact that the campaign finance system is based on a fiction: the proposition that donors give large amounts of money to politicians and expect nothing concrete in return and that politicians accept money without feeling obligated to give something in return.The truth is that perfectly legal donations brought out in the hearings -- a $300000 donation from a wheeler-dealer who wanted to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea a $230000 contribution from Indian tribes that got a favorable ruling from the Interior Department a $50000 contribution from a corporate executive who received a phone call from President Clinton -- might be considered bribery or extortion in other walks of life.

8,A Federal district judge here has removed the last Federal obstacle to construction of a 2.4-mile-long highway that will provide easy access between downtown Atlanta and the Carter Presidential Center. He ruled that state highway officials had satisfied all environmental concerns.The decision by the judge William C. O'Kelley handed down last week does nothing however to remove local opposition to the $22 million Presidential Parkway nor does it lift an injunction imposed by the Georgia Supreme Court.Alva Byrom an engineer in the State Highway Department said that the Federal ruling ''obviously relieves us of any problems with the Federal Government.'' But highway officials will still have to get the Georgia court to lift its injunction if it is to proceed with condeming land for the road.The State Supreme Court ruled in November that the Highway Department could not condemn land under a television broadcast tower owned by Cox Communications because motorists could be endangered by falling ice which sometimes forms on the tower's guy wires. Mr. Byrom said ''We intend to finalize the right of way and settle with Cox but I have no idea when that will be.'' Appeal Almost Certain

1,PhotoPhotoJohn V. Lindsay often delivered homespun advice to ordinary constituents and Edward I. Koch claims to have answered every letter or e-mail he has received. But a century ago few elected officials were more prolific or perspicacious in their correspondence than William J. Gaynor who became New York City’s mayor 103 years ago on Tuesday and served until 1913.A biographer Lately Thomas wrote that Mayor Gaynor’s “means of communicating with the mass of the people were two: the daily newspapers and the United States mails” and that he spent a considerable amount of his workdays personally answering his constituents. One critic even complained that the mayor who wrote thousands of his letters in office conducted “government by epistle.”In sheer numbers probably no mayor except Mr. Koch came close. And Mayor Gaynor’s letters were distinguished by frequent references to philosophers and other learned figures whom he had encountered during his early religious training.His candor sagacity vigorous defense of civil liberties and fierce independence (and his scrapping of the East River bridge tolls) endeared him to his constituents. In 1910 his shooting by a fired city employee prompted such an outpouring of sympathy that he was briefly mentioned for governor and even president. (Mayor Gaynor died three years later of complications from the wound.)A former seminary student and State Supreme Court justice he was nominated for mayor by the regular Democratic organization but governed independently and was described as a liberal with libertarian leanings.His inauguration as mayor on Jan. 1 1910 was his first visit to City Hall. From then on he routinely walked across the Brooklyn Bridge between his office and his home in Park Slope Brooklyn. He often coupled common sense with Greek philosophy which he wrote “seemed to astonish the whole journalistic fraternity in New York City.”No less a cynic than H.L. Mencken pronounced Mayor Gaynor a “great political philosopher and a great soul” who “began an heroic but vain effort to give New York decent government.”The mayor dictated his letters many of which survive as typed copies in the municipal archives. No subject was too small; he once delivered a lengthy exposition on how to boil an egg.Mayor Gaynor dismissed critics with sarcasm. Accusing a Republican politician of lying he wrote “Suppose you pray every morning for a while for God to direct you to tell the truth and see what fruits it will bear.”When Charles M. Frey an erudite rat catcher complained that his livelihood was threatened by repeated calls to jury duty the mayor suggested that rat catchers be exempt cautioning though that “so many exemptions have already been passed by the Legislature that there seems to be only the rat catchers and a few other people left to serve on juries.”To a solicitation for a $10 contribution from the Anti-Saloon League Gaynor wrote: “If I gave money in response to all the similar demands that are made on me I should be bankrupt in short order.”When a Christian minister asked for a license to preach conversion in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods of Brooklyn the mayor responded “Did not we Christians get much or the most of what we have from the Jews?’’When city aldermen proposed banning the Socialist’s red flag Gaynor lectured “They chose the color red for their emblem not to signify that they favor violence or the shedding of blood as the unintelligent suppose and as actions of those in official authority often lead people to believe but for the purposes of typifying the common brotherhood of all men of all nations through the same red blood which flows through the veins of all.’’Constituents frequently groused about noise. To one who was irked by the cries of newsboys Gaynor wrote “A whole lot of people have been hollering at me of late but they do not disturb me and much less does the hollering of the little newsboys disturb me.”To another who worked in the Flatiron Building near a church presided over by his nemesis the Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst and who complained that the clock on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower chimed 40 times an hour he wrote: “But really does the clock make as much noise as Dr. Parkhurst does? You know we all have to bear with something and I am willing to do my share of it.”When a Manhattan lawyer demanded that piano playing and singing be banned at night especially during the summer when people open their windows the mayor advised: “I hereby authorize you to carry out all of these reforms. It may be that you will first have to get elected to the Legislature and pass laws therefor for you know this is a government of laws and not of men.”He championed children’s street games advising one young man who wrote him “If you show this letter to the policeman I think he will let you play with a soft rubber ball on 101st Street between Lexington and Park Avenues if you ask him and if you are careful not to hit other people.”To a correspondent who grumbled that aldermen were extorting a fee to preside over marriages he wrote “if I had time I would marry you all for nothing.”His reply to a Chicago woman reads like advice to the lovelorn: “You are looking for happiness in the wrong direction. I do not think there is any man living who would suit you. If you want to be really happy for the rest of your life work for the happiness of others and forget yourself.”Gaynor was not easily impressed. Responding to a book by the pastor of a Park Slope church he wrote that the Emancipation Proclamation “had to be almost extorted” from President Abraham Lincoln “and the Russian emperor had done the like not long before.”Of George Washington Gaynor wrote that he was “of warm blood and prone to passion” that he was “even known to have sworn like a trooper at times” that his “face was pitted” and that he “was not the equal in knowledge of history economics and government of the men who surrounded him.”Many of the letters were answered the same day they were received. Form letters were dismissed. Anonymous ones were often answered in the press. “You are evidently a dishonest scamp but I acknowledge the receipt of all letters” he wrote one correspondent.And to the National Publicity Bureau which asked what message he would deliver to readers of the group’s 3000-member newspapers the mayor replied “I would say to them to be very careful about believing all they see in the newspapers.”

0,A letter published in the May 26 issue of Time magazine protests the inclusion in Time’s list of the world’s 100 most influential people of two researchers allied with the organization Cure Autism Now (a name that speaks for itself). The letter writer declares himself to be “outraged” because in his view “Autistic spectrum disorders are not diseases but rather markers of ‘genetic difference’ in the same vein as skin color [and] gender.” He equates the search for a cure with genocide — it’s “part of a campaign to wipe out ASDs” [autism spectrum disorder] — and he wants the world to know that those to whom the cure would be offered neither need it nor desire it: “I speak for many when I say we are happy the way we are.”A genetic difference is often adaptive and can be regarded as an advance in the evolutionary process; it is well-known that autism sometimes brings with it remarkable powers in the areas of music art and mathematics. In the 2006 movie “X-Men: The Last Stand” the augmented powers of those known as “mutants” are even more remarkable and include the ability to walk through walls to move metal objects as large as California’s Golden Gate Bridge to auto-generate fire or ice to be in seven places at the same time to read minds to assume any identity to kill with a touch to fly like Icarus to change the weather. These abilities are seen by many “normal” human beings and a few mutants as disabilities as an indication that the person who possesses one of them is a freak.From this perspective the best thing a mutant could hope for would be a cure and it is the discovery of one that sets the plot of the movie in motion. The response of both “centrist” and militant mutants to this “medical advance” is the same. Storm (Halle Berry) declares “They can’t cure us. You know why? Because there’s nothing to cure!” A crowd of mutants rallies to the chant “We don’t need a cure.” The leader of the militants Magneto (Ian McKellen) roars his defiance: “They wish to cure us. We are the cure the cure for an imperfect and infirm condition called homo sapiens.” Not only is he happy with the way he is; he pities and scorns those who walk another inferior way.It might seem meretricious and insensitive to link a serious condition like autism with the heroes and anti-heroes of a comic book fantasy. But the link is encouraged by the film’s director Brett Ratner who said on About.com that the story “has strong racial political and sexual aspects” and wonders “What if … African-American[s] could take a pill [that would] ‘cure’ them of being black or if a gay could take something that would alter his sexuality?” That is what if a condition scorned by the majority but prized by the minority that inhabits it could be eliminated by a simple injection? What would the minority do?In the case of blacks and gays the answer has already been given in the mantras “black is beautiful” and “we’re queer; we’re here; get used to it.” In the years since these battle cries were first heard African-Americans and gay Americans have secured rights gained in influence and earned respect however grudging and superficial.And why couldn’t the same thing happen to autism and mutancy or to any other mode of being that refuses the judgment of those who scorn marginalize and seek to destroy it? For it is a question Ratner observes of “the use and misuse of power.” Do those labeled deviant he asks acquiesce and “conform” to a “prejudice” or do they “maintain their uniqueness … and embrace what makes them different?”“Difference” is the key concept in these socio-political dramas and difference is an inherently unstable measure. In order to mark it — in order to say where difference resides — you must first identify a baseline a center; but any such identification will appear to those exiled to the periphery as arbitrary a function of prejudice and an illegitimate exercise of power: it’s only because there are more of you that you can consign us to the margins and refuse us respect. Armed with this argument (which flourishes in some versions of multiculturalist and deconstructive thought) there is no form of behavior that cannot make a case for its legitimacy and for its right to be free of external coercion whether it takes the form of legal sanctions or a forced “cure.”For some time now many in the deaf community — a phrase that makes an argument: we are not just persons similarly afflicted; we are a community — have resisted cochlear implants reasoning that to accept them would be to deny their culture their language and their identity. “An implant” wrote the editors of Deaf Life “is the ultimate invasion of the ear … the ultimate refusal to let deaf people be deaf.”“I’m happy with who I am” Roslyn Rosen then president of the National Association of the Deaf declared on “60 Minutes” (through an interpreter) “and I don’t want to be ‘fixed.’” The story of the “hearing world” writes Douglas Baynton associate professor of history and American sign language at the University of Iowa is that deafness is an incapacity; but he explains what we are dealing with are “physical differences” (exactly the point made in the letter to Time) and physical differences “do not carry inherent meanings.” That is they do not come labeled “normal” and “inferior” “abled” and “disabled”; these labels Baynton contends are fixed by “a culturally created web of meaning” a web constructed by no one and everyone a web that those who live within it find difficult to unravel even when they know that the meanings it delivers are false.Deafness appears it is said as a defect only against the background of a norm that has been put in place not by nature but by history. It follows then argues Lennard Davis editor of The Disability Studies Reader that “the problem is not the person with disabilities; the problem is the way that normalcy is constructed to create ‘the problem’ of the disabled person.” “There is no ‘handicap’ to overcome” insists Tom Humphries of the University of California San Diego. Paddy Ladd a British advocate of Deaf Culture draws the moral: “Labeling us as disabled demonstrates a failure to understand that we are not disabled in any way within our own community” and the implicit question he asks is Who is to say that your community is better than ours? I. King Jordan of Gallaudet University drives the point home: “People who come to our campus and who do not know sign language are communicatively disabled.” (PMLA March 2005)The logic of that question is the logic that has driven all the anti-discrimination movements of the last 120 years. A minority (deaf activists view themselves as a linguistic minority) is regarded by the mainstream as defective impaired criminal (Italians and Irish in the 19th century) inferior (Asians and blacks) immoral (gays polygamists and gypsies) lacking in mental or physical resources (women until only recently) and either less or more than human (X-men and Jews).Within the minority community the conviction grows that its stigmatization is the result not of “natural” deficiencies but of a politically established norm that serves the interests of the powers that be. Exposing that norm as a mere artifact of history with no special claim to authority means first that it is no longer obligatory to honor it and second that the community’s norms are worthy of both loyalty and protection. What was once seen as a deviation or something to be eradicated is re-characterized as a culture and in a short time the culture has a lobby and is demanding respect representation and even reparations for opportunities denied and rights withheld. The formerly shunned but now legitimized community opens cultural centers galleries (think of graffiti artists) museums historical archives and soon it is being courted by the very mainstream constituencies that for so long accorded it only a negative recognition.This could happen to any group; for once the norm has been relativized (you have yours we have ours; why can’t we just get along) there is no obvious way to declare a way of life beyond the pale. You can of course say that the test is whether those whose life style the majority finds dubious and offensive cause harm to others. But the “harm” standard (elaborated by J.S. Mill in “On Liberty”) cannot itself be neutrally applied. Smokers and pornographers say leave us alone; what’s it to you? Those who want to regulate them respond that smokers drive up our medical costs and pornography erodes family values and corrupts our children. Polygamists claim that they more than any honor family values (theirs is a big love); their critics talk about forcing young children to marry long before the age of consent and polygamists come back with the observation that the “age of consent” is a political construct and certainly wasn’t honored in the Bible. (This drama is now playing out in Texas.)Perhaps you draw the line by marking off what is criminal from what is not. But no category is more obviously the plaything of politics and prejudice than the category of lawbreakers. Until 1967 it was criminal to engage in interracial marriage; until very recently it was criminal to engage in sex with someone of the same sex; once it was criminal to teach blacks how to read; rigid drug laws have made criminals out of several generations of young men; Nelson Mandela was a criminal for decades.Maybe you apply the universal outrage test which one presumes would put pedophiles and serial killers in the class of those whose actions no one could possibly appreciate or justify. But the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) advertises itself as fighting for personal freedom and “for the empowerment of youth in all areas.” NAMBLA believes that any child regardless of age should have the right to say “yes” or “no” to a sexual relationship. Those who would deny them that right are guilty of “ageism.” (In short boys loved by men like the way they are.) And as for serial killers one admiring Web site credits at least some of them with the desire to purify the world by killing bad people as Dexter does in the cable TV series that bears his name (he is the cure); and the same Web site suggests that they are heroic individuals standing up to a repressive society: “People who become serial killers will not repress their fantasies and their true feelings just because society and morality do not accept [them].”I am neither making nor approving these arguments. I am merely noting that they can and have been made that they will continue to be made that there is no theoretical way to stop them from being made and that their structure is always the same whether the condition that asks for dignity and the removal of stigma is autism deafness blackness gayness polygamy drug use pedophilia or murder.We want to say that these are all different that there can be no equivalence between them and that making the case for one is not to make a case for the others. And of course as a practical matter that is true. The distinctions that can not be shored up by theory will be put in place at least for a time by history; and the degree to which they remain firm or are challenged will be a contingent matter depending on political social economic and other factors that cannot be predicted or managed.All we can be sure of is that the struggle between the impulse to normalize — to specify a center and then police deviations from it — and the impulse to repel the normalizing gaze and live securely in a community of one’s own will never be resolved.
0,To the Editor:As the numbers of dead and lost in the tsunami disaster continue to strain our credulity doesn't it seem incongruous that from the hourly news about the stock market sporting events and sundry national or local matters we might very well imagine that what has been occurring in Southeast Asia is not really happening?Given the fact that so much of our lives must now take account of global influences that bear on us shouldn't there be some public reminder of what masses of humanity have been going through?

1,Stifling censorship has enforced a silence over those who try to keep alive the memory of the protests and massacre and has scrubbed the internet in China of virtually any references to the upheavals. The country has become increasingly authoritarian under Xi Jinping the leader of the ruling Communist Party whose administration has rounded up rights lawyers labor activists students and Muslim ethnic minorities.“I’ve felt increasingly isolated” Mr. Zhou said in an interview in Beijing ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. “Not many people care about June 4; young people don’t even know about it.” He was speaking in a cafe in north Beijing where other customers eyes often fixed on their phones seemed a world away from the talk of demonstrations and bloodshed.Mr. Zhou’s daily reality is a stark reminder of how successfully China’s ruling Communist Party has married economic growth with authoritarian rule over the past three decades resoundingly rejecting calls for greater political freedom.But even more unexpected to Mr. Zhou were the troubles in Western countries that he admired as models of liberal democracy. The political divisions under President Trump and Britain’s Brexit shambles showed that even mature democracies could fall prey to dangerous populism and demagogy Mr. Zhou said.

0,SAN ANTONIO — With less than 40 minutes to kickoff of the Big 12 championship game here at the Alamodome between No. 1 Missouri and No. 9 Oklahoma fans are beginning to slowly trickle to their seats.By winning tonight the Tigers (11-1 7-1 Big 12) will clinch a berth in the Bowl Championship Series title game. Their lone loss this season was a 41-31 setback at Oklahoma (10-2 6-2) in October a game in which Missouri led in the fourth quarter and had four turnovers.Tonight’s game is expected to draw at least 60000 fans to this 65000-seat venue a Big 12 official said. If activity on the famed Riverwalk is an indication of attendance makeup the Sooners will seemingly have a 3:2 advantage in fans.Outside the dome Oklahoma fans were chanting “overrated” to Missouri fans. Missouri students Whitney Bodenstab and Alissa Rasmussen who drove 13 1/2 hours from Columbia Mo. to attend tonight’s game hardly seemed bothered by the taunting.“We’ll win because we’re better” said Bodenstab 20 a sophomore majoring in communications advertising and marketing. “We’ve developed a lot more since we played them last time.”Bodenstab and Rasmussen said they had enjoyed their first-ever trip to San Antonio and were impressed by the Riverwalk. They were also pleased with temperatures in the 70s here.“Usually it’s like cold” said Rasmussen 20 a sophomore of the weather in Columbia. “Like in the 30s and 40s.”But neither Bodenstab nor Rasmussen packed shorts for this trip.“Our legs are too white” Rasmussen said.
1,PhotoHaruki Murakami’s next book “The Strange Library” sounds surreal and experimental even for an author whose work features talking cats giant frogs and malicious miniature people.“The Strange Library” which will be published in the United States by Knopf this December is narrated by a boy who visits a library on his way home from school. An old man takes the boy hostage and forces him to memorize a large number of books. The boy eventually realizes that the man plans to absorb the information he’s memorized by eating his brain. With the help of a strange girl and a man dressed as a sheep the captive devises an escape plan. (Men dressed as sheep have cropped up in Mr. Murakami’s work before.)In a news release announcing the acquisition on Tuesday Knopf’s chairman and editor in chief Sonny Mehta called Mr. Murakami’s 96-page book “as scary and surprising as anything he has ever written.”“The Strange Library” will arrive just three and a half months after Mr. Murakami’s latest novel “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage” which came out in the United States in August. It sold more than a million copies in Japan and is currently No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list for hardcover fiction.“The Strange Library” may feel slight to some Murakami fans especially those coming off his latest 400-plus page novel and his massive 925-page novel “1Q84” which was published in English in 2011. Knopf is fleshing out “The Strange Library” with full-color art throughout in a lavish volume designed by Chip Kidd Knopf’s associate art director.

1,WASHINGTON — Facing mounting pressure over civilian casualties in American airstrikes the United States-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria said on Saturday that it was likely that at least 229 civilians had been unintentionally killed by its operations since they began in August 2014.In February the last month covered by the report and the first full month of the Trump administration four such civilians were killed the coalition said. The assessment issued monthly therefore does not include the March 17 strike against a building in Mosul in which scores if not hundreds of civilians were killed according to Iraqi witnesses. That strike is under investigation.The coalition’s overall count is far less than estimates by some human rights groups. Airwars a nongovernment organization that monitors reports of civilian casualties in international airstrikes has asserted that at least 2831 civilians are likely to have been killed as of March 28 by the coalition’s air attacks since August 2014.The worries about civilian casualties have grown as Iraqi forces push to take western Mosul from the Islamic State with the help of American and allied air power rockets and artillery. President Trump has vowed to step up the fight against the militants though the basic strategy in Mosul was set by American commanders during the Obama administration.

9,There are two separate constitutional due process issues in the case. One is procedural asking the Court to decide whether the West Virginia court established the procedural safeguards against excessive jury awards that the Supreme Court's 1991 decision appeared to require. The second question asks the Court to resolve the substantive issue of whether the $10 million award was so disproportionate as to be unconstitutional. The case will be argued in the spring.There were also these developments at the Court today: Old Policy and NewPresident-elect Bill Clinton's promise to withdraw the current executive order on the treatment of Haitian refugees has put the Court at risk of wasting time because the Court has agreed to hear the Bush Administration's defense of the current policy in a case due to be argued in February.After Mr. Clinton's election lawyers representing the Haitian refugees asked the Court to suspend further work on the case until after Inauguration Day to give the new President a chance to make the case moot. Without comment the Court denied the request. Justices Blackmun and Souter dissented also without comment. The case is McNary v. Haitian Centers Council No. 92-344.The Court has not yet announced whether it will hear another case that presents a similar problem in a different area of policy. The Bush Administration is appealing a ruling by a Federal appeals court in California that reinstated a lawsuit by a lesbian Army reservist Dusty Pruitt challenging her discharge for violating the Army's regulation against homosexuality. In reinstating the lawsuit last year the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco said the Army had not provided adequate justifications for its policy.The Bush Administration's appeal Cheney v. Pruitt No. 92-389 argues that the Army should not have to defend its policy and that the lawsuit should have been dismissed. President-elect Clinton has said he will lift the bar against homosexuals' serving in the military. Cable TelevisionAccepting an appeal from the Federal Communications Commission the Court agreed to decide the validity of a section of the 1984 Federal law that provides a regulatory framework for cable television.The law permits cable operators who serve residential customers in one building or in a group of buildings owned by a single individual or company to operate without a local license while requiring other operators to have a license. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the distinction violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.Because it is extremely unusual for a court to invalidate an economic regulation on equal protection grounds the case F.C.C. v. Beach Communications No. 92-603 is important beyond the rather narrow regulatory dispute that it involves. The broader issue is whether the Federal courts will be scrutinizing regulations of this sort more critically than in the past.

6,The court ordered that the Senate and Assembly be reapportioned on the basis of the “one man one vote” decision. It directed that a temporary plan for compliance be adopted bystatute in time for the 1965 legislative elections and suggested that a statewide convention be convened to effect a permanent plan in time for the legislative elections of 1967.The Senate is now and traditionally has been composed of one member from each of New Jersey's 21 counties. The 60 Assembly seats are apportioned according to population except that each county is entitled to at least one seat.Mr. Hughes in his message had proposed the creation of a 16-member commission to devise an interim plan for compliance with the court edict in 1965. He had asked that he be permitted to name at least eight members of that body.He had further suggested that a statewide convention be convened to formulate a permanent remedy for the dilemma. But he had urged the delegates to the convention not be elected until early in 1966 to remove the all‐important matter from the partisan political campaigns of 1965.Mr. Hughes had called the lawmakers into special session today to deal with the problem. While the legislators agreed to resume their deliberations at this time they denied the right of the Governor to order a special session inasmuch as the Legislature was only in recess and had not adjourned sine die.Mr. Hughes offered no specific plan of his own for either a temporary or a permanent solution to the districting dilemma. But he insisted that as Governor he had the right along with the public to participate in evolving such solutions.He urged that the problem be removed from partisan politics and that weighted voting as an answer to reapportionment be rescinded.

0,Lowen’s Pharmacy in Bay Ridge Brooklyn closed early on Thursday evening for a wake for its owner John Rossi. Mr. Rossi whose store was under investigation in a wide-ranging steroid probe was found dead in an office above the business on Monday with two apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Bay Ridge has been buzzing about his death all week.The neighborhood which stretches from 65th Street to 101st Street along Brooklyn’s eastern shoreline is fairly big geographically speaking. But maybe because of its low-rise buildings and neat front yards and maybe in part because it is hemmed in by expressways that clearly define its boundaries Bay Ridge where I went for this week’s Dispatches feature in the City section can feel like a small town.It certainly felt like one on Wednesday and Thursday on the sidewalks around Lowen’s where almost every overheard conversation centered on Mr. Rossi. Customers traded opinions in line at the Family Store a Mediterranean food shop across the street. Teenagers walking home from school stopped and pointed at the spot where the TV crew had been. A woman sitting on a bench in front of the diner down the block looked over at the pharmacy shook her head and said “I can’t believe they’re open already.”A few different factors made the story the talk of the neighborhood. First Mr. Rossi was by all accounts a personable trustworthy fixture behind the pharmacy counter. And Bay Ridge is a neighborhood where a knowledgeable pharmacist is important: A stretch of the neighborhood a little to the south of Lowen’s has been called a NORC a naturally occurring retirement community with a high density of residents older than 60. Residents said this week that these people especially appreciated Mr. Rossi’s expertise within walking distance.The steroid investigation which first came to Lowen’s with a raid in May had also kept attention on the store for the better part of a year amid reports that city police officers were among those accused of buying steroids there.Also one partner in the drugstore The Daily News reported Thursday was Julius Nasso who attracts a fair amount of attention of his own. Mr. Nasso who once worked at Lowen’s as a stock boy later served time in federal prison for conspiring with mobsters to extort money from the actor Steven Seagal.On Wednesday The Daily News had a reporter stationed outside Lowen’s to see if Mr. Nasso would show up. He did not.Finally hushed gossip in the neighborhood focused on the circumstances of Mr. Rossi’s death which the city medical examiner ruled a suicide. He reportedly was being sought to testify in the steroid inquiry and people who have doubts about the official story say he had a lot to live for and a lot of information that could have hurt others. They also focus on what killed him: two gunshots. Mr. Rossi was a pharmacist after all and as his longtime customer Lorraine Daly a rare neighbor who would express such sentiments on the record put it “If you had a choice pills or a gun what are you going to use?”Mostly regardless of the details people just said they were shocked and saddened that someone they knew and cared about was gone. As one note addressed to Mr. Rossi and taped to the front of the store read: “I never told you how much I respected and liked you. I wish I had. But now I have. Rest in peace see you in heaven.”

8,Soon the Hawks now calling themselves the Band were at work on an album of their own ''Music From Big Pink.'' That album and its followup ''The Band'' introduced Robbie Robertson's songwriting which combined a cinematic approach to imagery with a rare insight into American history and myth. Some of his songs were portraits of ordinary Americans caught up in changes they could only begin to understand like the Southerners facing the defeat of the Confederacy in ''The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.'' Other songs told tall tales in backwoods vernacular; some were stark stories of guilt and redemption with a vivid frontier ambiance. But as career pressures mounted the Band's records began to seem more calculated and by the mid-70's the Band's stage shows were beginning to seem cut and dried. Mr. Robertson decided it was time to go out with a bang. The result was ''The Last Waltz'' the concert in San Francisco that reunited the band with Bob Dylan and other musical associates and became one of the finest rock concert films lovingly directed by Martin Scorsese.The major influence on Mr. Robertson's re-emergence has been his rediscovery of his own American Indian roots. The album begins with deep reverberating tom-toms and several of the songs address Indian-related themes.''My mother was a Mohawk born and raised on a reservation'' Mr. Robertson noted ''and when I was a kid she would take me there to visit her relatives. I used to get this indescribable feeling from those visits and now I feel like it's time for me to deal with that American Indian element.''''Robbie Robertson'' is an eclectic and sometimes startling record. The drums one hears at the beginning are filtered through atmospheric keyboard textures that sound distinctly like Peter Gabriel's work and in fact Mr. Gabriel and his band do appear on several tracks. By working with artists as identifiable as Mr. Gabriel and U2 Mr. Robertson risks subsuming his own identity. But as the album progresses he cannily combines these familiar pop sounds with song forms vocal inflections and guitar sounds rooted in his earlier work. The soaring lyrical ''Showdown at Big Sky'' for example is strongly reminiscent of the Band's best years. And the two songs Mr. Robertson recorded with U2 in Ireland don't sound like U2 or the Band; they have a musical identity and an excitement all their own.The lyrics are intensely personal throughout whether Mr. Robertson is writing about his experiences as a teen-age rocker exploring the American South (''Somewhere Down the Crazy River'') or coming to terms with his American Indian heritage. Sometimes the writing seems wordy overwrought but this effect only underscores the album's evident sincerity. After keeping these songs and feelings bottled up for a decade Mr. Robertson seems to be letting them out all at once and the song formats he has come up with ingenious as they are at times can scarcely hold back the flood.

7,In baseball the best relief pitchers are those who “throw strikes” as the managers like to say.And last night for the edification of 38681 spectators at Shea Stadium Ron Taylor threw strikes almost exclusively in preserving a 7‐6 victory for Jerry Koosman over the Pittsburgh Pirates and the triumph gave the New York Mets a two‐game grip on first place in the Eastern Division of the National League.Koosman appeared about to produce his second consecutive complete‐game performance following his sore‐arm problems when Al Oliver doubled and Willie Stargell lofted a homer over the right‐field‐fence in the ninth inning.With the Pirates only a run behind Gil Hodges the Mets’ manager beckoned Taylor his right‐hand man in the bull pen. Taylor threw 11 pitches 10 of which were strikes in disposing of Bill Mazeroski Richie Hebner and a pinch‐hitter Jose Pagan for his ninth save of the season.Three Up Three DownMazeroski struck out on three pitches. Hebner after two strikes fouled off three pitches then popped up. Pagan took ball and lined Taylor's next pitch to Ken Singleton in left field for the final out.

0,Yale University will celebrate the largest class gift in its history this week when it credits the class of '54 with a contribution of more than $110 million.The bulk of the gift $90 million comes from an unusual fund-raising exercise born 25 years ago out of $75000 in seed money and frustration with the university's financial management.''Savvy money management is taken for granted by most graduates of universities today but it is a relatively new phenomenon'' said Richard Gilder a member of the class of '54. ''Yale does a great job of managing the endowment now but back then its investment performance was pretty lousy.''In 1979 Mr. Gilder and a group of his classmates were attending their 25th reunion and bemoaning the sorry state of Yale's finances when Mr. Gilder proposed a novel idea: What if they pooled their donations and entrusted them to a professional money manager with a plan to turn the principal and the interest earned over to Yale at their 50th reunion?

8,Q.You recently recommended storing a power lawn mower indoors in winter. However I prefer not to store anything indoors that contains gasoline. I don't have a garage but I am storing the mower in an unheated utility shed. Will extreme cold cause problems when I try to start the mower in spring? A.Your concern does not apply. One of the first things recommended when storing a power mower is to drain all gasoline from the tank carburetor and fuel lines. However storing the mower inside a cold shed will do it no harm and should not affect the engine in any way. Q.We recently moved into a house with an unheated dirt basement. We found firewood stored there covered with mold. A strong odor of mold pervades the house. We are removing the wood. What else can we do to get rid of the moldy odor? A.First cover the dirt floor with heavy sheet plastic or heavy tar paper. Overlap strips at least 6 inches and lap them up onto the walls 8 to 10 inches on all sides. Hold the plastic in place with bricks or cement blocks. Be sure the basement area is well ventilated with louvered openings on opposite sides for cross ventilation. The openings should be large enough to provide at least 1 square foot of unobstructed area for every 1500 square feet of floor area in the basement (screens and louvers over the vents cut the actual size of the opening by half). Q.My family room has a concrete slab floor that is very cold in the winter. It is about a foot lower than the first floor so I may add a ''false'' insulated floor on top of the slab. I plan to put down 2-by-4's with 5/8-inch plywood on top filling the spaces between the 2-by-4's with fiberglass insulation. The insulation will have a foil vapor barrier on one side. Where should the vapor barrier go - on the bottom against the concrete or on the top directly under the plywood? A.Always put the vapor barrier on the warmer side of the insulation - the side facing the heated area in the winter. Your vapor barrier should be on top of the insulation directly under the plywood. Q.Our concrete basement walls are covered with a white crystalline substance that looks something like a powdery dusting of snow. After we washed a portion of the wall off with bleach and water the substance seemed to ''grow'' back. What can be used to remove this? A.This substance is the result of efflorescence. It is caused by the release of alkaline salts that leach out of the concrete when there is dampness present and when there are excess alkalies in the masonry.You can get rid of the powder by washing with a mild solution of muriatic acid (one part acid to five parts water). This neutralizes the alkalies and washes off the white powder.There is no guarantee that the efflorescence won't come back unless you can eliminate the dampness. Applying a masonry paint or sealer sometimes helps but not always.Questions about home repair problems should be addressed to Home Improvement Department The New York Times 229 West 43d Street New York N.Y. 10036. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column; unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.

9,Hordes of creatures living in the hidden depths of the deep sea are in danger of starving to death scientists report. This remote part of the planet is believed to harbor millions of undiscovered species an unknown number of which may be in crisis.A study of food supply and demand miles down in the North Pacific between 1989 and 1996 found that creatures of the seabed suffered from growing food shortages. A likely culprit scientists say is a documented increase in sea surface temperatures during the same period.''If the food deficit continues it is going to change the configuration of the deep-sea communities'' said Kenneth L. Smith Jr. a biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego and a co-author of the report which was published recently in Science. ''Some species will die out while those that can survive on a very low food supply will still be able to maintain themselves.''Little is known about the creatures of the darkness much less about fluctuations in their diets and fortunes.

He also was known as one of the hardest working judges in New York setting records for the swift disposition of cases. Probe Into FitnessHe abruptly left the bench in January 1972 to halt a judicial inquiry into his fitness to preside at court. That investigation began after Federal and state official had started looking into his friendship with Nathan Voloshen an accused swindler who pleaded guilty in 1970 to charges of conspiracy to defraud Federal agencies. Judge Schweitzer denied each allegation and none of them was proven. Earlier in 1959 Judge Schweitzer was publicly criticized in some of the news media for refusing to make public a grand jury presentment regarding rigged television-quiz shows a subject rife with publicity."I've been called a thief and a crook and those things are never pleasant" he said in defending himself at the time. "But my first duty is to the law and to my conscience. I can be guided only by what the law tells me.

9,A little-noted amendment to the farm bill approved by the Congress last week is causing an uproar among consumer groups and even some producers of meat and poultry. But the framers of the amendment Republican staff members of the House Agriculture Committee say they cannot understand what all the furor is about.The amendment creates a Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection Panel with broad powers to review the decisions by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service on such matters as inspection procedures food safety standards and practices in meat and poultry plants as well as work rules and labor relations.Backers say the review panel would improve food safety by requiring more scientists to be involved in the decisions. Opponents say the panel's mandate will be too comprehensive. "We would grind to a halt" said Mike Taylor Acting Under Secretary for Food Safety and Inspection Services. "An incredible array of almost all the decisions we make would be put through this committee."The creation of the panel comes at a time when the Agriculture Department is about to replace the current system of visual inspections of meat and poultry with a more scientific approach that includes microbial testing and performance standards. While the industry does not agree with all provisions of the new system called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point most in the industry are eager for it to begin.

0,When Tony La Russa the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals was told that Ned Yost the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers said that he would do anything to help them deal with the death of reliever Josh Hancock La Russa nodded his head in appreciation.Then La Russa trying to steer an emotional conversation back to baseball on Monday night said “Can they forfeit the three games?”La Russa smiled. While his team is coping with the loss of one of their own after Hancock was killed in a car accident on Sunday in St. Louis he knows that the Brewers are playing about as well as anyone in the major leagues.Going into Tuesday’s games the Brewers (16-9) are in first place in the National League Central and are tied with the Atlanta Braves for the second-best record in baseball. The Boston Red Sox (16-8) have the best record. The Brewers have already built up a 5 1/2 game lead over the Cardinals (10-14) the defending World Series Champions.Jeff Suppan (4-2 2.55 earned run average) who beat his former team on Monday Chris Capuano (4-0 3.21 ERA) and Ben Sheets anchor the Milwaukee rotation. The Brewers also have a wealth of talented young players like Prince Fielder Rickie Weeks J.J. Hardy Bill Hall and Tony Gwynn Jr. So far this season the Brewers have been enthusiastic and fearless.“Our guys are doing a great job of not getting giddy” Yost told reporters on Monday. “They go out there every day and play their game. You can’t be jumping up and down. You can’t be going crazy. It’s April. We’ve still got five months to go.”Yes they do. But after one month the Brewers have looked formidable. Even as La Russa mourned Hancock he noticed that too.
0,Terra Lycos the Internet arm of the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica is considering the sale of the Internet portal Lycos US as part of a strategic shift in its operations but ''no definitive decision has been made'' said Telefónica's chairman César Alierta left at a shareholders meeting in answer to rumors about a sale. ''Terra networks is currently undergoing a process of analysis and revision of select operative units'' a regulatory filing with the Spanish stock market commission said. Telefónica bought Lycos US in 2000 for 12.56 billion euros but since then the company's value has shrunk sharply a company spokesman said. Telefónica is bolstering its Spanish- and Portuguese-language operations as evidenced by the purchase in the works of all Bell South's assets in Latin America Mr. Alierta said. Telefónica will nearly double its stake in its Portuguese partner Portugal Telecom from 4.7 percent to 8.17 percent he added. Dale Fuchs (NYT)

7,SCRANTON Pa. Dec 2— Pennsylvania has broadened its program for insuring against loss to property on the surface that results from the collapse of old underground mines.Amendments to the 1961 law setting up the insurance pro gram were signed by Gov. Mil ton J. Shapp at a ceremony this week at the Wilkes‐Barre Scranton Airport.The insurance program for merly self‐supporting and re stricted to private dwellings will now be subsidized by the state and its coverage will in clude any type of “structure” instead of just “homes.”Governor Shapp flew to the airport at nearby Avoca to sign the new amendments into law because most of the pressure for improving the insurance system came from legislators in the anthracite region embracing Scranton and Wilkes‐Barre.

8,Du Pont is ingrained here. It built this place - invented it admirers say - at the height of the Cold War after President Harry S. Truman told the company's chairman that the giant chemical concern a military contractor since the time of the Revolution was best qualified for the job. Describing the job at the time as ''probably the largest industrial project ever attempted'' Du Pont agreed to do it for costs plus one dollar.But for a decade engineers and scientists have worried about the age of the reactors and in recent months the Department of Energy has expressed dismay about worker attitudes pollution and the condition of equipment.Now Du Pont has decided to quit reasoning that in the nuclear industry that has grown up since work started here others now have more expertise. But the departure is a bit like the mustering out of a Vietnam veteran whose sacrifice is respected but whose work at the end is a subject of ambivalence. No Applause''There is no applause from the Department of Energy and we expect none'' said James E. Conaway who came here with Du Pont in 1951 and is now director of manufacturing for its Atomic Energy Division at a dinner gathering of the ''25-Year Club'' recently. ''Gratitude is perhaps the most fragile human emotion.''When the country asked for help he said ''we did it well.''''We know it'' he went on. ''Our families know it and our communities know it. As far as I am concerned nobody else counts.''In an interview he stressed that despite the risks postulated by various engineers and occasional accidents over the years the record was perfect. No one he said had been injured by radiation here. Workers were exposed to radiation in routine operations and in cleaning up after accidents but the exposures were within government limits Du Pont officials say.Department of Energy officials are reluctant to talk in detail about the performance of their long-trusted contractor in part because it reflects poorly on the department's supervision and because the same employees will be doing the work next week.
9,Governor Whitman like the incumbent before her was endorsed yesterday by the State Policemen's Benevolent Association an umbrella group of 350 local police unions with 32000 members.The association's president Michael Madonna praised her for signing laws allowing retired officers to carry guns ''Megan's Law'' to identify sex offenders to the communities where they live and a law authorizing life sentences for a defendant with three felony convictions.Richard McGrath a spokesman for Senator McGreevey the Democratic challenger said the endorsement was no surprise considering that the group traditionally backed incumbents. The police union backed Gov. Jim Florio in 1993 before he lost to Mrs. Whitman.
1,Julian Finney/Getty ImagesAfter Sloane Stephens upended Shahar Peer the 23rd seed on Thursday Stephens seemed less enthused with advancing to the third round and more excited about the car she planned to buy when she returned home to California.She is after all 18.Stephens said her performance cemented “for sure” the car purchase as soon as the season ends. Her mother wants Stephens to buy a truck; she wants a smaller vehicle. The kicker to all this of course is that Stephens also said she hates to drive.“That’s where it gets tricky” she continued. “See the thing is I don’t like traffic. It’s very hard for me to drive in traffic. And my brother is the most annoying person to have in the car when you’re driving.”There you have it. Youth. For American women in particular early into this tournament it has been served here. On Wednesday Christina McHale 19 and Irina Falconi 21 upset the No. 8 and No. 14 seeds.Stephens joined them in the third round on Thursday as did Vania King 22 and Serena Williams 29. That makes it five American women in the third round. Williams is now the elder stateswoman.“Fun fact” Stephens said. “Christina Irina and myself are all in the third round of the U.S. Open. We’re ready to go to the top baby. What’s up?”Stephens is no stranger to success. Her father is the late John Stephens the former N.F.L. running back. She won girls doubles titles at the French Open Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2010 and reached the girls quarterfinals or better in singles at all three too.With her victory on Thursday Stephens will crack the top 100 for the first time when the next rankings come out becoming the youngest person in the top 100. The next youngest? McHale whom Stephens will displace.“We’re heading in the right direction” said Patrick McEnroe the United States Tennis Association’s general manager of player development. “I felt that this was coming. When we start getting everyone into the second week we’ll be there.”

0,Detective Jennings's arm was in such pain this week from the shot that she could barely lift it. Her boss insisted she see a doctor but her thoughts were on her fiancé Robert Bolin also a detective who will remain behind watching after their house and caring for their rabbit three dogs and three cats. With war looming their wedding has been indefinitely postponed.''A sailor asked me 'How do you feel knowing that you would live but your fiancé would die?' '' Detective Jennings 32 said of a possible anthrax attack on the United States. ''That is devastating to think about. The realization of going to war is slapping people on the side of the head.''In Goodland Kan. residents lost their only Spanish-speaking doctor -- and the town's sole woman practitioner -- when Dr. Natalie Griego was activated by the Army National Guard. In addition to saying goodbye to her husband and her 22-month-old son Dr. Griego left behind hundreds of distraught patients including many expectant mothers.She saw about 25 patients daily at Rural Health Ventures the clinic where she worked with two other physicians and she also saw patients in a hospital a nursing home and a facility for the mentally handicapped. Shawna Blanka 32 of St. Francis Kan. had been driving 45 miles for her prenatal care. Mrs. Blanka is eight months pregnant.''When I first found out she was leaving I just wanted to cry to be honest'' Mrs. Blanka said. ''I've been a little stressed over it and this is not a good time to be stressed either.''Dr. Griego was given only 24 hours' notice to report for duty yet more than 200 people gathered in Goodland for a farewell party. ''For the last two days I couldn't talk without crying'' Dr. Griego 37 who is a captain in a medical battalion said at a deployment ceremony in Montrose Colo. ''I feel proud to be serving my country but that doesn't make it any easier.''Here in Albuquerque the loss of deputies is so worrying to Sheriff White that he has asked the New Mexico Legislature to add an emergency ''wartime clause'' to the state's retirement law so that he can fill the gaps on his staff with retired police officers. Right now retired law enforcement employees lose their pension benefits if they make more than $15000 in a year.

0,At the counter Ms. Maldonado explains to a clerk the purpose of her visit. She wants furniture for the new publicly subsidized apartment that she has just moved into. She had received a $706 grant only two months earlier which paid for beds for her two children and herself as well as a five-drawer dresser a kitchen table and four chairs. But she still needed something to sit on in the living room and a dresser for her own roomIt is unlikely that the city will help her she knows but she has no other way to pay. Although she has received training in Web design and emergency services and is now getting training as a nurse's aide Ms. Maldonado has not worked since 2001 when she was a receptionist. The father of her two children is in prison and contributes nothing to the family budget but she does receive some financial help from her boyfriend she said.The clerks give her a lavender slip and send her to the matching waiting room. Ms. Maldonado does not know it but this room was also a recent innovation designed for people with relatively simple requests like a public assistance card to replace one that had been lost or a child-care referral. In theory by separating people with more complex needs like applying for public assistance or child care both lines will move more swiftly.Still Ms. Maldonado is unappeased. Having been at the center in December she knows that all she has to do is fill out a form. With a pretty face and a dazzling smile she has had luck in the past using personal charm to shortcut the system. She tries here but to little avail. ''Can't you just give me the form now?'' she pleads with the clerks. But they insist that she has to get in the purple line.Once in the appropriately tinted section she takes a quick read of the situation and decides she is in for the long haul. The number printed on her slip is F3127 but on the electronic board that keeps track of clients being served there is only one F ticket being served -- F3078 at Window 4. Other letters like G and D are at other windows and nobody is going anywhere quickly. After F3078 does not change for 10 minutes Ms. Maldonado walks out at 12:50. She visits her lawyer (she is suing a previous landlord) and the subsidized housing office before heading back.2:25 p.m. Ticket F3078 is still being served at Window 4 according to the electronic board.By now the purple room is standing room only upwards of 50 people at least -- which is not bad compared to the gold floor where welfare cases are opened and more than 100 people waited on a recent afternoon. Still Ms. Maldonado is impatient.Not one to wait passively for the bureaucracy to do its work she marches around the corner to Window 4 to find the client responsible for the holdup. But there is no client only a worker typing into her computer and talking with other clerks. Ms. Maldonado goes to the counter and explains the reason for her pique. The clerk offers no explanation but promises the angry client that her number will be seen soon.

9,KITCHEN faucets receive hard use and can need repair as often as every few years. The good news is that generally little skill and few tools are needed to make these repairs and replacement parts for most faucets are inexpensive and available at hardware stores.Probably the most popular style of kitchen faucet has a single handle that controls both hot and cold water. Of these there of two common types a ball faucet and a cartridge faucet. A ball faucet handle has a dome-shaped base; a cartridge faucet has a cylindrical top that fits over the handle.If water flows only from one side of a faucet or pressure seems low unscrew the aerator from the end of the spout and clean the screen inside. (Use pliers to remove the aerator and for other jobs described below; wrap the pliers' jaws with electrician's tape to prevent scratching soft metal surfaces.)Other problems -- including leakage difficulty adjusting water temperature lack of extremely hot or extremely cold water and hot water entering cold water outlets elsewhere in the plumbing like toilet supply lines -- require disassembling the faucet and replacing some parts.
0,To the Editor:Re ''Who Built the H-Bomb? Debate Revives'' (April 24): In 1968 I asked Dr. Edward Teller to write a preface to the first edition of my Instrument Engineers' Handbook a totally unknown work then.I asked him in particular because his participation would emphasize that this work was a Hungarian-America contribution to the progress of science. He agreed and spent a whole weekend in the library learning about automation and process control before he wrote an outstanding handbook preface.This small episode shows that even before his heart attack he was neither self-serving nor manipulative but simply a generous caring man.BELA LIPTAKStamford Conn.

9,The police report on the gathering of that evidence was written by Philip L. Vannater and Tom Lange two of the four detectives who went to Mr. Simpson's home early on the morning after the killings. The report lists 24 "red stains" including what the detectives describe as blood on the door handle on the driver's side of the Bronco blood droplets leading from the van to the front door of the house and blood on a brown leather glove similar to a glove that investigators say they recovered near the body of Mr. Goldman outside Mrs. Simpson's home.An Early but Critical JunctureThe defense motion to suppress the evidence could be crucial to the case against Mr. Simpson.Because there are apparently no eyewitnesses to the murders and because the murder weapon has never been found prosecutors are expected to rely heavily on bloodstains blood and tissue samples and other evidence seized from Mr. Simpson's home and obtained at the crime scene.So if defense lawyers can convince a judge that the evidence was gathered in violation of Mr. Simpson's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure the prosecution's case could be weakened significantly.'Control of the Premises'The defense motion filed late Wednesday deals with evidence gathered by the detectives when they went to Mr. Simpson's house at 5 A.M. on June 13 to tell him of the murders. He was not there however having left on the flight to Chicago several hours earlier.When the detectives got no answer by ringing a doorbell at the front gate and telephoning the house the motion says one of them climbed over the wall surrounding the house and let three others in. After that the document says the detectives walked around the grounds and "assumed control of the premises."The defense motion contends that the authorities had no right to enter the property after determining that Mr. Simpson was not home. "Once they have determined no one is home by knocking or ringing a bell" the motion says "their official business is ended."
7,ALBANY Jan. 2 (UPI)— Sub‐zero cold clutched much of upstate New York for the second day in a row today with Albany having the low est temperature reported by the United States Weather Bureau in the 48 contiguous states.The capital still struggling with the remains of more than two feet of snow had a reading of —20 its second record in two days. The city's previous low mark for the date was —15 in 1968. Yes terday a reading of —18 eclipsed the previous Jan. 1 record of 11 below in 1964.Glens Falls with 41 inches of snow on the ground had a low temperature of —19 for this date.A new record also was es tablished at Greater Buffalo International Airport when the mercury sank to —2. The previous record of zero had stood since 1887.
9,"Satisfied vanity revealed becomes fatuity. This is the rather impertinent name which the hypocrites of modesty -- that is to say everybody -- have invented because they are afraid of genuine feelings." So wrote Jules Barbey D'Aurevilly in "Dandyism" published in 1897. Mr. D'Aurevilly meant to defend men of fashion against public scorn; but his words apply almost a century later to the much-maligned world of pop metal.The rock establishment considers this musical style which the Boston group Extreme brought to its pinnacle on Friday night at the Beacon Theater frivolous and technically lightweight. In fact the members of Extreme would probably flinch to hear the label applied to them. Live however the band is pure pop metal and gloriously so. Its key assets are the very ones that make rock's "hypocrites of modesty" uncomfortable: bold showmanship and sensual pride.The band's singer Gary Cherone strutted like a jazz dancer doing a strip routine; his well-toned body and theatrical costumes highlighted an unabashed sexuality. Nuno Bettencourt the guitarist was theatrical in a different way. He often commandeered the spotlight to perform lengthy solos that were as florid as they were masterly.Mr. Bettencourt is a genuinely innovative guitarist blending a machine-gun arpeggio technique with lyrical jazz rock and a picking style influenced by flamenco and bluegrass. His guitar is the cornstarch in Extreme's sound saving it from becoming thin and drippy. But Mr. Cherone's Broadway-style pizazz separates the group from the mass of preening "hair bands." He worked the stage with a panache that would have made Liza Minnelli green.
0,IN the first five months of this year companies with speculative credit ratings issued a huge amount of debt. But lately it has become harder to find enthusiastic buyers of their junk bonds.Through May the volume of new high-yield or junk bonds was up 53 percent compared with the corresponding period of 2002 according to Thomson Financial. And May has been one of the busiest months ever with $17.8 billion of such bonds sold.Seeking yields higher than the meager rates offered on safer bonds investors piled into junk-bond mutual funds. But recent data suggests that redemptions from such funds are rising.Bruce H. Monrad the chairman of Northeast Investors Trust in Boston with $1.8 billion under management most of it in high-yield bonds talked last week about the junk-bond market. Following are excerpts from the conversation:Q. According to Moody's Investors Service the default rate on corporate bonds stood at 5.8 percent for the 12 months ended April 30. That's down from 11.5 percent for the year ended Jan. 1 2002. Are fundamental conditions positive for high-yield bonds?

7,ROME June 2—Pope Paul VI today elevated his principal aide to cardinal thus placing him among the candidates for the papacy.The Pope appointed Archbishop Giovanni Benelli known as the second most powerful official in the Vatican the Archbishop of Florence. This post and his elevation to cardinal clearly put Monsignor Benelli among those mentioned as possible successors to the present Pontiff who will be 80 years old in September.Monsignor Benelli who is 56 years old has served for 10 years as deputy secretary of state. This powerful post allowed him to screen appointments and papers for the Pope. This is the same job once held by Pope Paul under Pius XII.Pope Paul was also moved from the job as deputy secretary of state to the post of Archbishop of Milan by Pope Pius. Such experience outside the Vatican is regarded as important for all papal candidates.

9,COULD you use $10496? That's what the average household in New York State would get back through the tax cuts approved by Congress according to the Tax Foundation a research group in Washington. Because so many New Yorkers including middle-class ones are in high tax brackets the average windfall in New York would be $3000 higher than in the rest of America.Yet New Yorkers do not especially want the money according to The New York Times/CBS News Poll released today. The tax cuts (vetoed by President Clinton) were favored by only 14 percent of the respondents statewide and just 13 percent in the city. Almost two-thirds preferred using the budget surplus to ''preserve programs like Medicare and Social Security.''You could quibble with the question's wording which presumes that current taxes can finance future benefits. That may be like presuming that you can give a crack addict money for his child's college education. The question could have been worded differently: ''Is your retirement money safer in a 401(k) account or in the hands of politicians up for re-election next year?''But New Yorkers would probably still give politicians the money. No matter how many studies come out showing that the city's residents pay more than their share of taxes to Albany and Washington and get back less in return they keep voting for taxes. Gov. George E. Pataki elected against the wishes of the city's voters did manage to cut state income taxes in 1996. But even that did not change much.

1,There’s a scene in “A Walk in the Woods” a low-impact amble through hill dale and cinematic nostalgia when our two crusty trekkers face down a pair of bears. The men — Robert Redford and Nick Nolte — are slumbering in their tents when the bears descend and begin tearing into the hikers’ food which they have failed to properly stash. The bears roar and the men thunder back flapping uvulas and arms to chase off the animals. It’s a mildly funny scene partly because of its light physical comedy and sight gaggery although also because Mr. Nolte his signature growl now often at sepulchral depths has been doing a fair impression of a wild beast for years.That great untamed being emerges these days in Mr. Nolte’s lumbering dominating physicality (he takes up space with personality and not just girth) and in the stubbornly insubordinate hair that insists on sneaking out from under his hat. Mostly you see it the way that you’ve always seen it: in the unyielding liberated spirit that can’t be tamped down either by age or by an easygoing easy-viewing entertainment like “A Walk in the Woods.” That’s a relief because while the movie involves a leisurely excursion on the Appalachian Trail it nervously runs from anything that might lead it into uncharted unsafe territory. Here the cooked outpaces the raw from first mile to last.The movie is based on Bill Bryson’s chuckle-out-loud 1998 nonfiction chronicle about his own Appalachian tramp which he started with an old friend Stephen Katz (a pseudonymous character played by Mr. Nolte) when they were both 44. It’s a story about men and friendship buoyed by Mr. Bryson’s light self-amusement (he refers to his pre-walk years of “waddlesome sloth”) and smooth storytelling that encompasses bite-size histories expansive lists blue notes and zoological asides on loons mountain lions and especially bears. It’s a pleasurable read and Mr. Bryson’s writing does what Ken Kwapis’s filmmaking can’t do which is take you on the trail so that you too trudge struggle and soar while observing flora and fauna and man’s inhumanity to each.

9,By all rights this should be the perfect time to be a woman in medicine.The days of women toiling as a mostly unwelcome presence in the country's medical schools are long over: women now account for roughly 45 percent of all medical students up from about 25 percent in 1980.And once they graduate they are in high demand: many patients especially women now request female doctors because among other reasons they are perceived as spending more time with patients. Further women's health issues -- breast and ovarian cancer most prominently -- are front and center in medical research and political agendas fostering star-studded fund-raisers road races and the like in every major city in the country.But despite these gains the top tiers of medicine have remained inaccessible to many women largely experts say because they are unwilling or unable to find a balance between the years of study those specialties require and a life outside of medicine.''Basically the picture is bad'' said Dr. Wendy Chavkin editor of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. ''Women comprise very few dean and tenured faculty positions and there are a lack of them in surgical specialties.'' The main reason Dr. Chavkin said is that in medicine ''there are still issues about career pathways that are the least bit off track like taking time off for child rearing.''
9,The Deluxe Corporation said yesterday that it planned to close more than half its check-printing plants and to eliminate 1200 jobs in the next two years. The company said it would record expenses of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter to pay for the closings. Deluxe which previously said it would close five plants said yesterday that it would close 21 more leaving 15 open. The company based in St. Paul estimated that the closings would affect 2400 full-time and 600 part-time workers at the 26 plants. The company said however that it expected to add as many as 1800 positions to the remaining plants by expanding the number of work shifts. The company said it expected more staff cuts in the next two years.

0,The state's 30 poorest school districts will receive $315 million in supplemental state aid for next school year only about a fourth of the $1.2 billion in supplemental aid the districts had requested the state Department of Education announced last week. Supplemental aid pays for programs like full-day sessions for preschoolers and increased teaching staffs that were required by the state Supreme Court in the long-running dispute over funding for poor mainly urban districts known as Abbott vs. Burke. The supplemental aid is in addition to the $2.9 billion the state already has allocated for the 30 poorest districts out of the nearly $6 billion that is appropriated for all school districts.

8,A new system of one-judge one-case justice has cut the backlog of pending felony cases in New York City by more than 16 percent since it was introduced in January court administrators announced yesterday.The decline - from nearly 13000 in early January to just under 11000 as of last week - was the sharpest in that key indicator in at least three years they said.The new system which involves both civil and criminal cases calls for each case to be handled by a single judge from the moment the cases enter the court system until they are settled by a verdict a plea or a dismissal.In addition to the drop in pending felony cases the new system has also increased the number of cases disposed of and the rate at which they are finished according to the court figures.

8,AGB Television Research which took on the A. C. Nielsen Company in a costly war for the business of measuring the American television audience has surrendered and will suspend its ratings operation in the United States.AGB spent $67 million in its effort to replace Nielsen as the standard used by the television networks and the advertising industry. Its hopes were based on a hand-held electronic audience measuring device called a ''people meter'' which AGB's parent company Audits of Great Britain invented a decade ago.But Nielsen which for decades had a near-monopoly on the national television ratings business in this country developed its own people meter system to counter AGB's and exploited its dominant position in the marketplace to prevent AGB from gaining a foothold.AGB also announced on Friday a tentative agreement to acquire Mediamark Research Inc. a large market research firm based in New York from MAI P.L.C. a British financial media and information services company.

0,Marines withdrew Friday from most of the positions they had taken during the three-week siege of this city as the American military began handing over control of security here to an Iraqi general under Saddam Hussein and up to 1100 men under his command.Marines abandoned buildings and bulldozed earthworks in southern and western neighborhoods of the city as the former major general Jasim Muhammad Saleh rolled into town wearing his old uniform with its crossed swords and eagle on the epaulets. Hundreds of residents cheered him along the streets some waving the old Iraqi flag.In a country where tribal loyalties are by far the most powerful allegiance it is unclear whether support of the occupation forces or national interests can supersede those or whether the Iraqi force will be willing or able to fight the insurgents.Gen. John P. Abizaid the commander of American forces in the Middle East cautioned in a teleconference from Qatar that the entry of the Iraqi soldiers would not necessarily quell the insurgency anytime soon. ''I think that we should be very careful in thinking that this effort to build this Iraqi capacity will necessarily calm down the situation in Falluja tonight or over the next several days'' he said. ''It's a step-by-step effort that will have to include a clear understanding of the security situation.''[Page A6.]
9,'Didn't Do It for Love'Directed by Monika TreutNot rated; 82 minutesOne thing you can say about Eva Norvind the flamboyant subject of Monika Treut's documentary film ''Didn't Do It for Love'' is that she has never stayed in one mode for very long. When she was still a teen-ager in the early 1960's the Norwegian-born actress took a bus from New York to Mexico with only $10 in her pocket. She quickly established herself as a blond buxom star in a series of Mexican B-movies and worked as a prostitute whose clients included a number of prominent Mexican politicians. Later she participated in a scheme to smuggle television sets into the country.After appearing on Mexican television advising women about birth control and creating a scandal by exhibiting herself on the streets in a bikini Ms. Norvind was officially deported from the country (but remained secretly) and had an illegitimate daughter.Moving to New York City after winning a scholarship to study film at New York University Ms. Norvind established a raffish literary salon of sorts and under the name Ava Taurel became a professional dominatrix administering punishment and humilation to a mostly male clientele (many of her clients were lawyers she recalls) at $300 an hour. As business boomed she began teaching workshops in dominance and submission and appeared on television talk shows.All this frenetic change is more than one modest 80-minute movie can comfortably encapsulate. The person shown in the film clips of Ms. Norvind when she was a Mexican movie star bears hardly any physical resemblance to the severe gray- haired woman of today who in the movie's black-and-white film clips of her practicing her sadomasochistic trade fits the 1940's movie stereotype of a menacing prison matron.
9,There is the remembered grandeur of the Penn Station demolished in 1963 and the envisioned grandeur of the new Penn Station proposed at the post office site. In between is a dreary sweltering subterranean hub with an industrial-basement atmosphere.But this summer in the culmination of a $190 million renovation by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority a new central entrance will open: a 90-foot-high glass and brick tower on the south side of 34th Street just west of Seventh Avenue. A rediscovered clock from the original Pennsylvania Station will hang there."It's going to be the Long Island Rail Road's new front door" said James C. Collins the project manager. "It's something we've never really had with all our side entrances and it will give the station an identity."The tower will hold powerful air-conditioning equipment to cool the terminal long vilified as an inferno in the summer months.

9,An 11-year-old boy went on a shooting and robbery rampage on Tuesday before wounding a security guard who then held the boy for the police the authorities said.The boy left school with his mother earlier in the day telling nurses that he did not feel well. Once home he shaved his head put on a ski mask and a monk's robe and set out with his father's rifle the police said.The security guard Lawrence Misa 27 was shot in the hand when he tried to grab the rifle outside a hair salon that the boy had robbed The San Diego Union-Tribune reported on Wednesday. He then held the boy until the police arrived.The boy a sixth grader whose name was not released is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday morningHe first approached a group of cable workers who thought he was pulling a prank until he fired two shots at them. The boy who stands 4 feel tall and weighs 50 pounds then approached two joggers demanded money and fired into the air said a police spokesman Bill Robinson. Minutes later he walked into a beauty shop fired a shot into the ceiling and demanded money.

9,The quarterback squeaks when he speaks. That may be one of the few remaining items on Charlie Ward's rapidly shrinking list of weaknesses as he approaches his fifth game as a starter at Florida State.When the Seminoles take an undefeated record into the Orange Bowl this Saturday before a sellout crowd cheering for Miami to extend its 47-game home-field winning streak the X-factor may well prove to be a quiet gifted quarterback."I speak pretty loud" Ward said. "My voice kind of squeaks but it's kind of loud. You have different voices. You have deep voices. You have soft voices and you have squeaky voices. I happen to be soft and squeaky." High-Pressure GameNow well into his junior season the son of a longtime Georgia high school coach will continue his rapid development in one of college football's most high-pressure games. The matchup has had an impact on the top of the rankings since the mid-1980's.
1,Barton Silverman/The New York TimesTwo boys one with a glove stood on the field behind home plate Wednesday and watched Mets left fielder Jason Bay hit a batting-practice pitch so hard that one of the boys was sure the ball would leave Citi Field.“Aww that is gone! Home run!” the boy said.The ball confronted by the humidity in the air and the roominess of the park died at the warning track.“I thought that was gone!” the boy said.He was not the first to be fooled.Bay hit six batting-practice home runs and Ronny Paulino hit the facing of the second deck in left field. Jason Pridie hit the facing in right. But even batting practice with easy 40-foot pitches was hardly a power show for the Mets.Besides being short-handed or partly because they are short-handed the Mets have become home-run-challenged. They took a 10-game streak without a home run into Wednesday’s game against Pittsburgh their longest such streak in 21 years.The Mets went a team-record 17 games without a home run from Aug. 27 to Sept. 13 1980. That 1980 team which went 67-95 also had streaks of 13 and 12 games without a home run according to Baseball-Reference.com.Their current streak ended in the eighth when Justin Turner hit one to left — perhaps the only highlight in a 9-3 loss. Turner’s shot also ended a 10-game streak without a home run at Citi Field. The last time they did that at home was from Sept. 9-20 1979 when they played at Shea Stadium.Both streaks underline the continuing debate about Citi Field whose large dimensions and high walls in left field have seemed to prove vexing in particular to David Wright and Bay. They have also raised questions about whether the Mets should move home plate out or bring the fences in.“To me it’s a perfect park because I’m not a home run hitter” center fielder Angel Pagan said. But Wright and Bay are.Daniel Murphy had been the last Met to hit a home run on May 20 but that was at Yankee Stadium. Pridie had been the last Met to hit a home run at Citi Field on May 6 against the Dodgers. The Mets entered the day with 37 home runs fewer than any National League team except Houston. “I think it’s the result of the lineup” Mets Manager Terry Collins said before the game referring to injuries to Wright and Ike Davis. “I actually have not seen guys who look like they’re overswinging.”“It’s difficult for me to have an opinion on it” he added in reference to Citi Field.Pagan can offer recent examples of how it cuts both ways. He made a magnificent running catch near the 415-foot sign in right-center field to help preserve the Mets’ victory over the Pirates on Monday but he hit a shot near the same spot that was caught Tuesday.

8,''Never have I been in such a situation and I didn't know how to behave myself'' he said through an interpreter at the Forum's postgame news conference. ''I still think that the best hockey fans live in Montreal. It's difficult to express my feelings. I am very glad they liked how I played but don't forget I was playing against their team. So that doubles my good feelings about this applause.''The applause may have been fueled by reports in the local papers quoting him as saying that should Soviet authorities permit him to play in the National Hockey League he would want to play only for Montreal.''I would like that because the Canadiens are very much like my team the Red Army club in being many times champions'' he was reported to have said. ''Also it would be nice to play before such a great crowd. But of course it is up to my coach and the authorities.''Peter Stastny of the Nordiques disagrees with those who consider Tretiak one of the world's best goalies. Stastny is the 25-year-old former star of the Czechoslovak national team who defected to Canada with his two brothers. He insists many Europeans share his view.''A lot of people especially here in Canada make a big hero out of him but he has bad days and good days like any other goalie in Europe'' said Stastny who is out with a knee injury. ''The Russians in the past didn't have many good goalies Tretiak is the best they've had in the past 15 years. But during that time Europeans will tell you the Czechs usually had the best goalies in Europe and the Swedes have had very good ones too.''

1,Advice Parental Quandary Every Friday we pose a question to the Motherlode community. The next week we pull together the best responses. Got a quandary? E-mail KJ ». Read more »This week’s quandary came from a message J. sent via Facebook: How she asked can we keep the children in our great family-friendly neighborhood from hanging out with us in our yard — all the time?J.’s block sounds pretty idyllic. “Kids run around unsupervised go from one yard to another without thinking about boundaries neighbors know each others’ kids …” Which means that whenever there’s a backyard activity suddenly there’s a whole party of children ready and willing to jump in. That’s great if you’re a kid at loose ends for the afternoon and not so great if you’re trying to have an outdoor party with just visiting family or just don’t feel like having the whole neighborhood in your backyard.My husband who works from home and so is available after school at times a lot of working parents aren’t (including me) wants to toss a football or visit the river to explore with our boys in the afternoon. He expresses frustration that he wants to share those experiences with his own sons not a larger group of neighborhood kids.J. knows this is a good problem to have but still it’s a problem if only one of tact and etiquette. She doesn’t want to be unfriendly and often the neighborhood kids are perfectly welcome at her house just as her children often are at other houses on the block.“We just wonder” she writes “how to communicate ‘this is family time’ or ‘this is a backyard gathering spontaneous and casual but you’re still not invited’ without alienating others” particularly when those others are just kids.

1,What is the showdown about?Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 and Mr. Johnson has vowed that it will happen on time with or without a deal. But opposition parties and a significant number of rebels in his Conservative Party are adamantly opposed to a no-deal Brexit which they say would be chaotic and economically damaging in the short and long term.Seeking to tie Parliament’s hands Mr. Johnson said last week that he had asked the queen to prorogue or suspend Parliament later this month cutting short the already tight time frame for lawmakers to come up with a way to prevent Britain from crashing out of the European Union with no agreement in place.The move left lawmakers scrambling for a way to weigh in on the most momentous decision the country has faced in its recent history. They decided to ram through legislation requiring the government to seek a Brexit extension if it has not reached an agreement with the European Union on withdrawal by the deadline.Mr. Johnson has made it clear that he was unalterably opposed to seeking another extension and on Tuesday he reiterated his plan to call for snap elections if the legislation were approved.“I don’t want an election the public don’t want an election but if the House votes for this bill tomorrow the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on Oct. 17 to sort this out and take this country forward” Mr. Johnson said referring to the next European Union summit which is seen as the final moment for a deal to be reached.
1,£4000/$49007. Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso One RééditionThe Reverso has long given watch buyers an entry to Jaeger-LeCoultre’s diverse collection of in-house-produced watches with dozens of steel versions of the Art Deco-themed piece with time-only displays offered over the years. But the tiny Reverso One Réédition sized for women’s wrists at just 16.3 millimeters wide uses a quartz movement rather than one of Jaeger’s in-house mechanical calibers to bring the price down to less than $5000. Not that quartz Reversos are new but it is telling that the brand has placed a battery-powered watch at the center of its 2016 activities (and forgoing high-end complicated Reversos altogether) particularly given its successful focus on ladies’ mechanicals over the last five years. jaeger-lecoultre.com

1,VideoAnatomy of a Scene Directors offer behind-the-scenes narration on their films.In this video the director Tim Burton discusses a sequence from his film “Big Eyes” based on the life of the artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) and her husband Walter (Christoph Waltz) who takes credit for her artwork. Some of the look of the scene Mr. Burton said was inspired by the films of the Italian director Mario Bava. He also discusses the quiet internal performance given by Ms. Adams.
1,As my colleague Ellen Barry reports on Wednesday “Doku Umarov a former Chechen separatist who reinvented himself as a proponent of global jihad took responsibility for two suicide bombings on Moscow’s subway that killed 39 rush-hour commuters.”The video claim of responsibility (embedded above) was uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday but was recorded on Monday the day of the attacks in Moscow according to Kavkazcenter.com which Radio Free Europe calls “an unofficial rebel website.” (Kavkaz is the indigenous name for the Caucasus.)My colleague Viktor Klimenko in Moscow has prepared a translation of the rebel leader’s complete statement of responsibility in the video which is below.In the statement Mr. Umarov said that the suicide bombings were revenge for a recent Russian operation that killed civilians near the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia in Russia’s North Caucasus region. He also said that the attacks one of which took place at a subway station near the headquarters of the Federal Security Service also known as the F.S.B. the successor agency to the Soviet-era K.G.B. ﻿were a message to the security service.Here is a translation of his remarks which began with an Arabic greeting and continued in Russian:Praise Allah our God and prophet to his family to his followers and to all those who stand for the name of Allah in this world. I am the emir of the Kavkaz mujahideen Dokku Umarov. I am making this statement on the 29th of March 2010. As you all already know on the 29th of March two special operations were carried out in Moscow to destroy kafirs and to send a greeting to the F.S.B. Both operations were carried out on my orders and they are not the last ones inshallah and I would like to stress why they have been carried out. As we all know On the 11th of February 2010 officers of the criminal formation known as the F.S.B. carried out an operation to destroy peaceful citizens in the area of the village of Arshty — some of the poorest people who made their living by picking up wild garlic shoots and selling it. These people were mercilessly destroyed killed by those bandit groups under the name of the F.S.B. There were stab wounds signs of degradation of the corpses. I think that today’s operation carried out on my order was carried out against not the poorest Russians because these operations were carried out in Moscow. And today any politician or journalist or any person who will condemn me for those operations or who will accuse me of terrorism I am laughing at those people. I can only grin because I haven’t heard that Putin was accused of terrorism for the murder of civilians who were killed at his order on the 11th of February. I guarantee you and guarantee all the Russians who send and support all those special services which are sent here which commit all those atrocities — your bandit groups which are on our territory of the Caucasus — this is not the last operation. These operations will continue. They will continue on your territory inshallah. As for the operation to revenge for those mujahideen who died on the 11th of February you will see it soon and hear it. It will be carried out with use of special measures inshallah. This is why I state with full responsibility that [as] I promised you Russians watch the war only on television and on the radio and this is why you are quiet you don’t react to the atrocities committed by your bandit groups led by Putin which are sent to the Caucasus. This is why I promise you: the war will come to your streets inshallah and that you will feel it on your own lives and on your own skin. Allahu Akbar!As Ms. Barry explains Mr. Umarov began his career as a nationalist before announcing relatively recently that he was fighting a religious war:

0,Some restaurants stand at unusual culinary crossroads. Metropol stands at an unusual cartographical one.It faces the intersection of two numbered streets that sound to the uninitiated as if they should be parallel to each other and about a quarter mile apart. But West Fourth and West 10th do indeed meet an asterisklike exception to Manhattan's usually tidy grid an anomaly that happens to be Metropol's address.The restaurant itself represents a more typical convergence.It's part bistro part brasserie those terms and genres being so thoroughly confused and conflated in New York these days. Globe-shaped lighting fixtures dangle from a pressed tin ceiling. A distressed mirror dominates one broad wall.To those vintage flourishes Metropol weds the semiotics of a certain kind and era of downtown Manhattan cool. There are enormous black-and-white photographs of Edie Sedgwick Andy Warhol Nico. There's a thick cover of darkness.

8,''DAMN YANKEES'' at Jones Beach is what it is; so is its star Joe Namath. A production at Jones Beach is not like productions elsewhere: Zachs Bay laps at the set; fog rolls across the stagelights; for $1 you rent a blanket to keep warm. Mr. Namath is different too. He is not so much a performer as a personality and the wonder is not that he can sing or act well but that he can sing or act at all. Dancing however is beyond him although once or twice he does sway in time to music.Nonetheless Mr. Namath has genuine charm. He smiles a lot. He sings in a light baritone or when he is having trouble in an amiable bellow. His perfectly capped teeth are like little beacons on the vast Jones Beach stage and when he appears bare-chested in a locker-room scene people in the audience go ''Ooooh.'' It is unclear if they are recalling Mr. Namath as football player or Mr. Namath as sex symbol but probably it doesn't matter. Mr. Namath is carrying out a successful flirtation; the audience is responding. The personality if not the performer has it made.Meanwhile there is Eddie Bracken as Mr. Applegate tramping through ''Damn Yankees'' with a wonderful sturdy professionalism. Mr. Applegate of course is the devil who offers a middle-aged insurance man baseball immortality in return for his soul. Consequently ''Damn Yankees'' is a show about our innocence. Its assumption is that baseball - the sport not the big business entertainment spectacular it has become - is worth selling your soul for. Its further assumption is that the only thing better than baseball is a good marriage. In a world like that even the devil has his good points. Mr. Bracken blustering conniving comic and oily finds all of them.As always at Jones Beach the big ensemble pieces work better than anything else. Susan Elizabeth Scott a long-legged amusing Lola leads the mambo number (''Who's Got the Pain'') and Alyson Reed an almost equally long-legged amusing Gloria the sports reporter leads the Washington Senators number (''Shoeless Joe From Hannibal Mo.''). The Richard Adler-Jerry Ross score is still awfully good and at the Lost Souls Cafe (''Two Lost Souls'') everyone sings and dances except Mr. Namath. He is perched high above the stage out of harm's way looking on benignly. What's a personality for anyway? The Old Ballgame DAMN YANKEES words and music by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross; book by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop based on Mr. Wallop's ''The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant''; directed and choreographed by Frank Wagner; scenery and costumes by Robert Fletcher; lighting by Marc B. Weiss; musical director Joseph Klein. Presented by Richard Horner Associates Mr. Horner and Lynne Stuart in association with the Long Island State Park and Recreation Commission.

0,FOR lunch one day in Priorat I was served chicken with prunes and with it I drank of course a Priorat red. It may seem that a wine with the heft of a Priorat would overpower the mildness of chicken. But in fact it struck the perfect balance.The cook had used the leg and thigh of the chicken rather than the breast and braised them with wine and soft plump prunes. The leg and thigh have darker meat and more flavor which stood up to the wine. The prunes underlined the fruit in the wine and the wine in the recipe -- yes white! -- cut the richness of the dish. There is no rule against using white wine in a dish that you pair with reds.Potent wines like Priorats demand ample dishes that can withstand their power. Aside from this recipe roasted lamb is a natural. AMANDA HESSERBRAISED CHICKEN WITH PRUNESTime: 40 minutes4 chicken thighs4 chicken drumsticksKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

9,'All the Protection'Dexter Lehtinen the acting United States Attorney in Miami replied to Mr. Rubino's charges in a written statement saying: ''Mr. Noriega has been accorded all the protection of due process and right to counsel. Nothing the Government has done regarding illegally obtained assets has infringed on these rights in any way.''Judge Hoeveler said he expected to meet with defense lawyers and prosecutors on Wednesday in an effort to resolve the impasse over General Noriega's funds. He said it was possible that the defense would decide to sue the Government to force release of some of the assets but Mr. Rubino said he had not yet decided on additional steps.Mr. Rubino said Judge Hoeveler had considerable leeway under the law to appoint a public defender or other counsel or if he chooses to force the present lawyers to continue to defend General Noriega. Judge Hoeveler said it would be difficult for a public defender to handle a case that ''will require enormous resources.''The United States Government Mr. Rubino asserted was claiming that all the general's assets estimated at between $20 million and $60 million were profits from illegal activities and therefore were subject to seizure. Mr. Rubino and other defense lawyers strongly disputed the Government's contention.Question of Money's OriginsAt least a portion of General Noriega's assets had been earned legitimately Mr. Rubino contended. He made a point of arguing that some of the frozen assets had come from fees that Central Intelligence had paid to General Noriega over the years for services to the United States Government.Mr. Rubino estimated that charges and expenses incurred in General Noriega's defense had mounted to more than $1 million and he said that defending the general was threatening to bankrupt him. After more than four months of nearly full-time work Mr. Rubino said he and other defense lawyers have received less than $100000 for expenses including travel hotels and secretarial fees.In addition the burden of defending General Noriega Mr. Rubino said has prevented him from taking on several clients whose cases he would have accepted under other circumstances.

9,The MFS Communications Company the largest provider of high-speed telephone and data services to businesses said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Internet service provider Uunet Technologies in an exchange of stock valued at $2 billion.Analysts said the proposed acquisition which was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies underscored the rising importance of the Internet as a business communications medium. The deal would also create a new type of telecommunications company one that will be able to link national and international companies with high-speed telephone Internet and video transmissions.This shows that the Internet is a lot closer to the traditional telecommunications area than anyone thought" said Ken Leon senior vice president of the Chicago Corporation in New York.And it could get even closer. Investors saw the alliance as a possible starting gun for a long-awaited consolidation of the Internet service provider business generated by telephone companies that are looking to buy rather than build their own Internet expertise.

9,Scott Shuger spends the small hours each morning reading newspapers on line and writing a daily column for Microsoft's on- line magazine Slate critiquing newspapers across the country. The column Today's Papers appears unedited.Last week Mr. Shuger was the target of some pretty fiery critiques himself.The reason was his comments in last Monday's column about African-American college students. He was critiquing an article in The New York Times about a survey that showed a wide disparity in computer use between students entering elite private colleges and those attending traditionally black public institutions.Mr. Shuger suggested that ''it might be good to add a question to the survey: 'Do you have a luxury sound system or a car less than two years old or a luxury sound system in that car?' Today's Papers recalls being in Atlanta a few years ago at the annual spring break for traditionally black colleges Freaknik and being amazed at the numbers of students' hot cars and loud stereos. Any computer/Internet paucity among students attending traditionally black colleges may be a function of their own interests and choices rather than that of affordability.''E-mail responses to the magazine were overwhelmingly negative calling Mr. Shuger's remarks ''racist'' and ''idiotic.''
0,But the new crop of tablet PC's represent much more than machines mimicking pen and paper. Computer makers say that technology is forcing handwriting to evolve in terms of how and when it is used. The tablet PC's may not only reflect those changes but also hasten them.''I don't think we are physically losing our ability to write with a pen and pencil but I do see changes'' said Edie Adams manager of hardware user research for Microsoft. For example she said handwriting has become more useful as a thinking aid for taking brief notes and working out ideas. Tablet PC technology is designed to take advantage of this aspect of handwriting -- as ''one to one or even one to self'' communication Ms. Adams said.But Microsoft has also had to focus on just how ''dirty'' quick and dirty handwriting can be. Mr. Dixon said that developing the tablet's handwriting recognition software was complicated by the necessity that it be able to recognize a wide range of handwriting styles at a time when many Americans say they can hardly recognize their own.More than one million handwriting samples are written into the tablet's software to help it read and convert handwriting into text. Even so Microsoft acknowledges that the technology converts handwriting into digital text with varying degrees of success. But developers say that people should expect no more from the technology than they would from the person doing the writing.''If someone takes a handwritten note and the next day they come back and can't read it'' Mr. Dixon said ''well our handwriting recognition engine is not going to do so well on it either. The general rule of thumb is that you get better results with neater handwriting.''For years computer technology developers have been searching for a reliable and simple means to let people write on their computers as easily as they might type on them. The concept got its first widespread exposure in the mid-1990's with Apple's Newton a pioneering hand-held computer. But the Newton ultimately failed as did several more recent attempts including a pen-based I.B.M. ThinkPad and a Sony Vaio desktop Pen Tablet.Microsoft's effort is by far the most ambitious to convince computer users that the pen can be as logical an addition to the keyboard as the mouse. Like previous proponents of handwriting-recognition software the company hopes that some users will find it easier to write on a computer screen than use a keyboard.
9,If there's a typical letter from readers of this column it's something like this one I recently received from a New York City resident:''Help! I need it desperately. I am in the market for a new point-and-shoot camera to replace a Canon Sure-Shot which was stolen last summer. I reverted to using my old beloved Minolta Autocord but find it somewhat cumbersome heavy and expensive when it comes to processing.''I have done research and am most confused. I want a zoom camera that is reliable not too difficult to handle and which incorporates all the lastest features - although I am confident that a week after I make my purchase several new models will be in the stores. As of now I have narrowed the field to six cameras with a side-glance at a seventh. They are not in order of preference:''Minolta Freedom Zoom 90 Nikon Zoom 500 Olympus Infinity 200 300 and 330 Pentax IQ Zoom and a side-glance to the Olympus AZ-4 Zoom.'' The letter goes on to note the urgency of my response since a trip to an exotic foreign locale is impending.First of all my ability to respond to letters asking for camera advice is limited by the number of requests for same that regularly arrive in my pathetically miniscule mailbox. Second I have to congratulate this particular reader for the intelligence with which she went about finding cameras that seem to fit her needs. And third I need to clear up some misconceptions about camera shopping.Personally I hate shopping of any sort. The process seems designed to lead one from total ignorance to total confusion. Most salespeople just make it worse. So like many consumers I read up on the subject of my purchase first. If the subject is cameras I would buy magazines like Popular Photography Photo District News or Consumers Reports to see what's out there. I'd also poll my friends who have cameras to see what they're using these days.

0,City personal income tax cuts first proposed nearly a year ago are finally making their way toward reality with a City Council committee yesterday approving a scaled-back cut that would save city taxpayers only about $190 million a year about a quarter of the original plan.The city tax cut when combined with an already planned state-financed reduction in the local income tax would result in a combined savings of about $327 next year for a two-child family with an annual income of $100000. For a single taxpayer earning $25000 a year it would translate into about $73 in savings over all.The city tax cut approved by the Council committee yesterday is tentatively set to go into effect Jan. 1 and has already been approved by the State Legislature and endorsed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. It still needs to go before the full Council which is expected to approve the measure.''The city has enjoyed an incredible fiscal recovery and now it's time to return some of that money back to our taxpayers'' Peter F. Vallone the Council speaker said yesterday.

8,PHEW but that was a close call! They actually picked one of my numbers during the big Pick-Six drawing on Dec. 2. That means I was only five numbers away from $11 million and I can't begin to tell you what a relief it was to lose.You see lotteries don't pay off winners in old money the kind that comes with a degree from Princeton and a sensible tweedy wardrobe. No they pay off in new money.Do you know what would happen to me if I ever won $11 million in new money? First I would buy a bunch of gold chains and shirts that glow in the dark. Then I would go down to the nearest Cadillac showroom and pick out a car probably a pink one with whitewalls and lots of velour inside. Then I would drive it to a customizing shop and replace the Cadillac emblem with a new ornament perhaps a swan.I would drive around in my pink Caddy shopping for a vacant lot on which to build my new home. I'd then hire an architect from the Yellow Pages and tell him that I like things pink and shiny and that there had to be a Jacuzzi in every room.

9,More than a month after signing a letter of intent to acquire the Islanders Bob Gutkowski's $180 million bid to buy the team is moving slowly with no certainty of success.Gutkowski's group must satisfy the Islanders' owners Howard and Edward Milstein and Steven Gluckstern that it possesses sufficient financing to complete the purchase. It must also satisfy the demands of John Pickett the former Islanders owner who is owed tens of millions of dollars in deferred payments. Paying off Pickett may require a restructuring of his deal.''I've been talking to the Gutkowski group and the stumbling block is the due diligence it's doing on the team and deciding whether to go ahead or not'' said Mort Certilman Nassau County's chief negotiator with the team for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum.Gutkowski declined to comment.The due diligence involves examining the finances and operations of the franchise which lost $20 million last season to assess its worth. After the process the agreed-upon sale price could be adjusted up or down. RICHARD SANDOMIR
0,General Motors filed for bankruptcy protection in federal court in Manhattan on Monday a humbling fate for the longtime titan of American industry.The bankruptcy filing which includes the Saturn unit of G.M. is a means to a government-sponsored reorganization that would slim the carmaker down by selling its most desirable assets to a new entity that would be majority owned by American taxpayers.G.M. said in its filing that it had $82.3 billion in assets and $172.8 billion in debts including $26.3 billion in unsecured debt held by more than 500 creditors. Its largest creditors were listed as the Wilmington Trust Company representing holders of nearly $22.8 billion of bond debt and affiliates of the United Automobile Workers union representing nearly $20.6 billion in employee obligations.The case was assigned to Robert E.

9,In the last few days environmental arguments against a huge new hydroelectric project proposed in Quebec have become far more likely to force further delay in the signing of a 20-year $19.5 billion contract between Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power Authority and in the project's construction.At a forum Thursday night in Manhattan the chairman of the Power Authority Richard M. Flynn said that an environmental review of the project's effects in Canada including effects on native Cree and Inuits might take 18 months to three years. Therefore he said his agency will not sign the agreement by Nov. 30 as it earlier agreed."We're certainly not going to finalize agreement while there are important questions left on either side of the border" Mr. Flynn said.The authority under pressure from environmentalists in New York had asked Hydro-Quebec which is developing the project east of Hudson Bay in northern Quebec to determine its effects on animal and plant species. Opponents argue that it would destroy a wilderness harm animal species and increase mercury pollution.

0,And here’s another one from the Bad Customer Service Files: a guy who recorded his phone call to AOL in an attempt to cancel his AOL account.Frankly I find the caller pretty discourteous but the lengths to which the AOL rep went to prevent the cancellation really are pretty amazing.(Once the call became public online AOL issued an apology. “At AOL we have zero-tolerance for customer care incidents like this…the employee cited here is no longer with the Company.”)Listen up AOL: we all know that the dial-up era is ending. Offhand I don’t know exactly what your salvation will be. But I can tell you pretty confidently that trying to argue your customers out of canceling isn’t the big answer.

1,Steve Marcus/ReutersThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether trades in health care stocks by the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors as recently as last year were made using inside information a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.The investigation comes as SAC one of the most prominent hedge funds in the world with $12 billion in assets under management has become something of a focal point for authorities. Two former SAC portfolio managers have pleaded guilty to criminal charges of using inside information to trade technology stocks.And Senator Charles E. Grassley Republican of Iowa has questioned how the S.E.C. handled referrals from Wall Street’s self-regulator the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority regarding 20 stock trades by SAC.But the S.E.C.’s investigation into trading by SAC appears to be much broader. In addition to the inquiry into trading in health care stocks — trades that took place from at least 2007 through 2010 — the agency is examining SAC’s use of expert network firms companies that connect Wall Street investors with outside experts in various industries the person briefed on the matter said.Separately the S.E.C. is looking into whether the hedge fund used inside information about the 2007 takeover of MedImmune a biotechnology company the person said. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported about the inquiry into MedImmune.A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.Neither SAC nor its billionaire founder Steven A. Cohen has been accused of wrongdoing by the S.E.C. or by any other authority. A spokesman for SAC declined to comment on Thursday.The inquiries into the SAC trades are part of an accelerating effort by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan to crack down on insider trading with a particular focus on hedge funds. The criminal investigations by federal prosecutors have resulted in charges against 49 people 39 of whom have pleaded guilty.Two people who have pleaded guilty were the former SAC employees Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil. Mr. Freeman is expected to testify Thursday at the trial of Winifred Jiau a consultant for an expert network firm who is charged with leaking inside information. SAC has said that it is “outraged” by the conduct of the two former employees.The cases against Mr. Freeman and Mr. Longueuil are part of the government’s examination of expert network firms which developed over the last decade alongside the proliferation of hedge funds. The government has filed criminal charges against 13 people connected to the firms eight of whom have pleaded guilty.The former SAC employees admitted to obtaining inside information about public companies and then using it to make profitable trades. The charges against the men detailed a cover-up straight from a television drama that involved destroying a hard drive with pliers and spreading the parts throughout the city.Others with past ties to SAC have also been ensnared in the insider trading investigation. Earlier this year Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided two hedge funds founded by former SAC executives Level Global Investors and Diamondback Capital Management. In 2009 Richard Choo-Beng Lee pleaded guilty to insider trading related to activity after he left SAC.The S.E.C. has faced criticism that it failed to bring significant cases against prominent hedge funds as well as cases stemming from the financial crisis.In April Senator Grassley asked the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in a letter to provide information on the “potential scope of suspicious trading activity” at SAC.Last month he followed up with a letter to the S.E.C. requesting to know how it handled past referrals about SAC’s trading activity.MedImmune is not among those trades referred by Finra according to people briefed on the matter.SAC executives including Peter Nussbaum the firm’s general counsel and its outside lawyers met with staff members in Mr. Grassley’s office to discuss his inquiry.Additionally federal prosecutors are examining trades in an account overseen by Mr. Cohen.Court filings related to the cases of the two former SAC portfolio managers who have pleaded guilty to insider trading indicate that the government is reviewing trades made in Mr. Cohen’s account at the suggestion of the former employees.

9,"A show for thinking adults very artistic very theatrical but very athletic" she said. "The image of professional skaters is that after they turn pro they cut down on the sport and only have to look beautiful."Usually ice shows are all floofy and fluffy. I don't have anything against it; it's important to have those. But that's not something I worked so hard for for 20 years you know clowns poodles and snow falling from the ceiling. That's not real skating. I want people to be entertained but I want them to leave the show and talk about it. Our show is provocative."The show is scheduled to conclude its North American run in early March but that hardly means another Caribbean vacation right away. As the principal asset of her own company in Frankfurt and the principal client of a marketing firm in Charlotte N.C. she is finding her commercial options expanding.This week she was in New York to discuss a forthcoming line of skating attire from Danskin that she is helping design. What fun and what a departure from the old days in East Germany when the authorities gave her a say in the costumes she would wear in competition but little more."This is totally different" she said. "This is leotards tights leggings everything. I know what I like to have the kind of cut the prints. It's a dream to be able to do what I want and wonderful to be in it from the beginning." Fascinated by FascinationOther opportunities are under consideration including a series of competitions for professional skaters that she and Boitano plan to organize. But she declined to discuss them with any specificity until plans were complete or contracts signed.Meanwhile she has become intrigued by the growing fascination the rest of the world is developing for her. This is the kind of stuff that sort of embarrasses her in conversation but she let it slip there was this one time not long ago in Dallas where she was performing at a rink in a fancy shopping mall. Scads of men about four deep stood mesmerized by her. And she loved it.

8,We're lucky. We have a house in the country. The house is in Massachusetts 137.6 miles from our apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan - if we take the Taconic State Parkway north and then Route 23 east. If we take the Saw Mill River Parkway and Interstate 684 and Route 22 turning off at Wassaic and proceeding through Sharon Conn. and Mill River Mass. then the whole trip is 114.7 miles. Sometimes we take the Taconic Parkway only as far north as Route 44 and travel east from there through Millbrook and then Sharon etc. 121.6 miles. There are other routes that we sometimes take and I know the mileage for all of them as well as I know the first symptoms of car-seat fatigue from my 1-year-old daughter and from my son the question ''Are we almost there?'' which he begins to ask 8.4 miles into the northbound journey (in Yonkers that is) and 6.3 into the southbound leg.For you see I have made this same trip thousands of times. I have been making it for more than 40 years. (I remember the Hawthorne Circle. I remember when you could buy fireworks in Connecticut; I remember when big long cars squeezed past each other on the Taconic. I remember when you could take the train!) Getting there has become - for me - so much less than half the fun that I would need to resort to a negative fraction to express it mathematically. The tedium which grew exquisite almost ecstatic more than a decade ago has now been whatever the opposite of ''leavened'' is by the otherwise joyful addition of our two young children who naturally lack the repressive power that adults have and consequently do what I would in my heart of hearts like to do for a large part of the trip - whine cry eat and (if we're in luck) fall asleep.When and if the kids do take naps simultaneously my wife and I try to have some adult conversation. ''After all it's really one of the few chances we get'' we say to each other. Here's how it goes:ME: So what's on your mind?WIFE: I've been trying to figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life.ME: And what have you come up with?WIFE: I've been thinking of taking up a new line of work. The trouble is nothing else really appeals to me. Silence for .4 miles. ME: You know I've been sort of wondering what I'm going to do with myself too. WIFE: And? ME: Well maybe I could go into a different profession. But then I have to remember that I like my job pretty well. WIFE: I know what you mean. Silence for 1.6 miles. ME: We could sell the house and buy another one that's a little more um convenient. WIFE: That's an idea. ME: But we won't. WIFE: No we won't. ME: We couldn't sell it. WIFE: No we couldn't. Silence for 2.8 miles.

9,When Peruvian guerrillas take one of Tess's colleagues hostage young Melody Shepherd arrives in Washington from a small affiliate station. Melody says she is the hostage's niece. Although someone mentions that the captured man never said over some 20 years anything about having a niece good old Tess takes the novice under her wing even inviting her home until she can find an apartment. Melody's working technique is disarmingly simple: "A bit of promise. A lot of suggestion."It takes the usually astute Tess an incredibly long time to figure out what's going on but she begins to get the picture as Melody seduces not only her son Andrew (David James Elliott) but also her New York boss Brad (Jed Allen) who decides -- shades of a certain morning news show -- that early viewers might appreciate a younger woman all blond and perky while getting ready for work. Finally Tess catches Melody going through her personal computer files. That's it."We may be working on the same story" Tess says "but my work is my work and your work is whatever I tell you to do."Melody is anything but subtle. Surveying Washington at night she gushes about "the sheer power of this town: like an aphrodisiac" (the movie's original title was "Potomac Fever"). Meanwhile Tess has been having mostly by long distance an intense affair with Peter (Stuart Wilson) an English foreign correspondent who wants her to give up everything and run off with him to Spain. This leads to endless discussions on the nature of love. She: "But I love you." He: "And I love you. Therein lies the tragedy." (Presumably the British can get away with lines like that.)And in the end "Her Wicked Ways" is thoroughly dishonest preoccupied only with giving the mass audience what it supposedly craves -- an upbeat ending. Bette Davis may have allowed herself to be bested by the unstoppable Eve but this is the world of television stars and Barbara Eden is not about to take second place to any Melody Shepherd. Tess gets not just her revenge but also the anchor job and Peter who in case you missed the point says "Your life is damn near perfect isn't it?"
1,Eric Broadley a onetime cabinetmaker from Britain who became an acclaimed designer of racecars whose speedy creations won the Indianapolis 500 and numerous other events died May 28 in Cambridge England. He was 88.The cause was complications of a stroke his daughter Diane Broadley said.Mr. Broadley a tinkerer and self-taught engineer started building cars in his spare time at the urging of his cousin Graham Broadley. In 1958 they emerged with the Mk1 a lightweight sports car that Eric Broadley raced at the Brands Hatch track in Kent. In a qualifying heat he raced faster than anyone there ever had.The press “was around like bees round a honey pot” after his stunning time Mr. Broadley told Motor Sport magazine in 1989. But the race meet’s organizer suggested that a car that fast should be driven by a better quicker driver than him. Mr. Broadley agreed conceding that “my inexperience showed very very quickly.” (He was disciplined in the final for erratic driving.)The car’s performance at Brands Hatch was a breakthrough. Mr. Broadley and his cousin received orders to produce more Mk1s from their modest garage. In the decades that followed working under the Lola Cars name Mr. Broadley would design and build myriad cars that raced on various circuits including Formula One CART and IndyCar. His work earned him a reputation that rivaled other contemporary British racecar designers like Colin Chapman the founder of Lotus Cars.

1,Dear Simon Branson: Today is going to be a good day and here’s why.Oh wait wrong show.But a person could be forgiven for momentarily confusing “Superhero” the new musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother with “Dear Evan Hansen” the hit musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother.It’s not just that the boys’ names scan so similarly. Or that both shows are about fatherless families: Evan’s the result of divorce; Simon’s the result of an accident. The opening songs (“Anybody Have a Map?” in “Dear Evan Hansen” and “What’s Happening to My Boy?” in “Superhero”) have nearly identical emotional setups including nearly identical phrases about mothers finding their way back to their sons.More fundamentally both “Superhero” and “Dear Evan Hansen” show how damaged people try to use stories whether fictional or outright false to rebuild themselves after trauma — and how they may create new traumas in the process.

0,Sarajevo to Celebrate SontagSarajevo will honor Susan Sontag by naming a street in her memory and placing a plaque on one of its theaters The Associated Press reported. Sontag the American critic and novelist who died on Tuesday at 71 made many visits to the city the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina when it was besieged during the conflict in Bosnia from 1992-95; she took part in staging a production of "Waiting for Godot" there in 1993. In a statement the office of the city's mayor Muhidin Hamamdzic said "The city of Sarajevo and its citizens express their sincere thanks to an author and a humanist who actively participated in the creation of the history of Sarajevo and Bosnia."Filmmakers in PerilSometimes life imitates art; sometimes it comes hair-raisingly close. Chris Kentis and Laura Lau right the married filmmakers whose terrifying "Open Water" based on a real incident dealt with a vacationing couple abandoned in shark-infested waters narrowly escaped death themselves when the tsunami swept onto the resort island Phuket in Thailand on Sunday The Associated Press reported. Mr. Kentis 41 said he was returning to his hotel after running some morning errands when he saw the gigantic wave. "I heard people yelling 'Run! Run!"' he said. "I looked behind me and I thought 'This is what happens in a movie when there's a tidal wave.' You could hear the rumbling and this wave was coming right at us." Hurrying to his room on an upper floor he found his sister-in-law and other relatives but not his wife and 7-year-old daughter Sabrina. They were in a second-floor Internet cafe trapped by a phone booth lodged in the stairwell as the power failed and electric lines crackled around them. Ms. Lau 41 said she escaped from the cafe balcony with Sabrina on her back after using a bamboo ladder to pull a half-dozen Swedish tourists to safety. The she and her husband fearing another immense wave hiked several miles into the mountains with their luggage. A few hours later traveling by mini-cab they reached Phuket's virtually unaffected east coast. "When we got there it was all people on yachts having a good time" Mr. Kentis said. "It was just surreal."Waiting for ParisGuess who was late for her own party? Is the answer -- Paris Hilton below -- a surprise? Scheduled to appear for the pink-ribbon cutting at the opening of her first nightclub Club Paris in Orlando Fla. on Thursday Ms. Hilton arrived six hours behind schedule The Associated Press reported. She emerged from a stretch S.U.V. shortly after 1 a.m. yesterday to walk the pink carpet while pink spotlights illuminated the night. "I was in the Swiss Alps skiing and I got caught at the airport with all the holiday travel" Ms. Hilton said with a smile "so I've been trying to travel for the past 24 hours." Many of the guests who included local officials and leading Orlando businessmen had already left. "I'm so sorry I'm late" Ms. Hilton said. Her sister Nicky Hilton took her place at the ribbon cutting.Nobel Novelist's Movie"Fateless" the film adaptation of the novel of the same title by Imre Kertesz below the 2002 Nobel laureate in literature will have its premiere in early February at the 36th Budapest Film Festival The Associated Press reported.

9,That display of harmony among political opponents who were trading recriminations only weeks ago was interrupted when a black nationalist faction the Pan-Africanist Congress walked out this afternoon. It wanted the convention held outside South Africa but that and its other proposals were rejected.Barney Desai head of the Pan-Africanist delegation said his group was suspending participation until it consulted its members some of whom are upset about the willingness of some of its leaders to negotiate.The Pan-Africanist Congress maintains that only Africans belong in South Africa. Guests From AbroadMr. Ramaphosa and Mr. Viljoen urged the few other parties that boycotted the preparatory talks to attend the December convention or find themselves marginalized politically. The right-wing Conservative Party which wants to preserve apartheid stayed away as did extremist groups like the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement.The Azanian People's Organization a black consciousness movement also rejected the invitation contending that participation was tantamount to collaboration with the Government.Guests from the United Nations the Organization of African Unity the Commonwealth and foreign embassies here will be invited and the sessions will be open to the press.The December convention is expected to open with speeches by Mr. de Klerk the African National Congress's leader Nelson Mandela and others and then to form working groups that will focus on aspects of the negotiating process. The African National Congress and other opponents of the Pretoria Government's will press demands for an interim administration and the election of an assembly to draft the new constitution both of which Mr. de Klerk opposes. Political ManeuveringThe realization that negotiations were at hand appeared to overcome ideological differences accounting for the show of tolerance with which the meeting ended today.

1,PhotoDonald J. Trump has been ruffling feathers with Hispanics with his tough talk on immigration but on Tuesday the Republican presidential candidate took a step to try to smooth things over.Mr. Trump invited Javier Palomarez president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to his Manhattan office for a meeting to clear the air. Each were joined by two staff members for a 90-minute meeting that Mr. Palomarez described as surprisingly cordial and productive.“He was very mannerly very hospitable and never once did he interrupt me” Mr. Palomarez said noting that Mr. Trump listened more than he talked during the meeting.Mr. Trump declined to comment but his spokeswoman acknowledged that the meeting took place.Mr. Palomarez said that he had expressed his disapproval with Mr. Trump’s plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico and to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. He also explained to Mr. Trump that such moves would severely cost the construction and hospitality industries which rely on the labor of immigrants.Mr. Trump politely disagreed Mr. Palomarez said and made the case that undocumented workers were imposing significant costs on the United States economy.While Mr. Palomarez said he was not endorsing Mr. Trump he did express “shock” at how friendly the conversation was and and said he was impressed with the candidate.“He was not combative he was not rude” Mr. Palomarez said. “He was a complete gentleman.”Despite the warmer feelings differences remain.Mr. Palomarez said that when he and Mr. Trump discussed the idea of the chamber holding its convention in Miami next year Mr. Trump suggested that it be held at the Trump National Doral Resort there. Given Mr. Trump’s recent tone toward Hispanics Mr. Palomarez said such a choice was unlikely.
8,''We are taking in about 70 percent of our total budget in ticket sales'' he said adding that the corporate side and ancillary efforts have made up the difference.However he said that the theater capacity in both the 500-seat facility and the larger 2310-seat one ran about 60 percent last year. During the coming season the center hoped to raise that to 90 percent.''With the help of Stanly Simon the Borough President of the Bronx the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs has given us a grant of $25000 for the elderly which will pay for half of their half-price tickets'' he said. Ticket prices range from $7 to $15 for all performances.Mr. Light has dropped last year's plan to increase rental income from the two theaters because they are used most of the time. For example the center is now the home of most of the Bronx's performing-arts groups including the Bronx Opera the Bronx Symphony Orchestra the Bronx dance theater and the Bronx Arts Ensemble. In addition the college's academic departments mostly music theater and dance are heavily using the 500-seat theater now he said. Some of the costs for these operations are offset by the Bronx Borough President's Office''In short'' Mr. Light said ''we are really striving to be a community theater and Westchester is considered part of our community.'' Group sales he said are particularly strong from Westchester.The managing director said that many performing-arts groups were considering the Lehman center as a doorstep to Manhattan. This trend has been continuing since the first season and many groups who want to play New York but can't afford the tremendous costs of renting in Manhattan or for other reasons are doing this.The Dayton Ballet which is coming in March is one example of this trend and that troupe will have a New York premiere ''Stage Piece'' then Mr. Light said. This was true in previous years of thePittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Le Grand Ballet Canadien. ''Afterward they went downtown and then to S.U.N.Y. Purchase. We got them tremendous press coverage and now they are coming regularly. Last year Ballet Jazz made its New York City debut at Lehman College and this year the Ballet Hispanico will have a world premiere by Patricia Birch their choreographer on Nov. 20.

9,ST. JOHN'S 97 ST. FRANCIS 63It was the moment more than the context that rankled St. John's last night. The Red Storm built a 16-point lead over St. Francis of Brooklyn only to watch the Terriers slash the gap with an 8-0 surge to begin the second half.Shades of last week when St. John's blew double-digit leads in losing to Stanford and Purdue right?But St. Francis is no Stanford or Purdue. The Red Storm responded with an 8-0 run and never was caught.I was only concerned that there was an 8-0 run St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said. I wasn't concerned whether we would win the game or not. We tried not to have any letdown.

The committee is not asking for the identities of individual players -- 44 are known to have been suspended for testing positive -- but it is asking for the number of players tested and the number of positive tests for each drug.Tagliabue promised full cooperation. The N.F.L. has one of the toughest steroids policies in professional sports and recently announced it wanted to toughen its program to Olympic standards.The letter to the N.F.L. was the first in a series of letters that will be sent to the other sports organizations as early as Monday Robert White a spokesman for the committee wrote in an e-mail message yesterday.Davis and Waxman also wrote in the letter to Tagliabue that the committee would hold additional hearings at an unspecified time. They had previously said they would consider additional hearings after the March 17 hearing at which the retired slugger Mark McGwire refused to answer questions about whether he had used steroids and members of Congress criticized baseball's new steroids policy."As the committee has stated publicly numerous times its focus on the issue of performance-enhancing drug use in sports is not limited to professional baseball" Davis and Waxman wrote to Tagliabue. "The hearing was the first in a series for the committee as part of its ongoing investigation into steroid policies for professional and amateur sports."

9,To the Editor:Jesse Zel Lurie (letter Sept. 23) contends that Israel should surrender the strategic Golan Heights to Syria because "it's either peace now or war later."Israel's top military experts seem to disagree. The Israeli Army chief of staff Gen. Ehud Barak remarked in Washington recently that "from a professional military standpoint as long as there is no peace we need every meter of the Golan Heights and also at a time of peace we had better stay on the Golan Heights."Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai head of Israel's northern command called the Golan "a quiet volcano" because Syria has "the power to change the situation from one of peace and quiet in a fairly short time . . . In such circumstances the Golan is an important strategic asset and security region for the country's north."MORTON A. KLEIN National President Zionist Organization of America New York Sept. 26 1994

0,Readers respond to Thomas Friedman’s Mar. 1 column “Who’s Afraid of a Gas Tax?“Sherm Gallay Lee N.Y.: Can you get a voting majority of Americans to make a deliberate sacrifice which directly affects their pocketbooks? I would like to hope so but I don’t think so. Your pro-tax stump speech is compelling and accurate but I don’t think it will have broad appeal.You know there is one easy cost-free way to immediately reduce fuel consumption — enforce speed limits. A vehicle traveling at 65 miles per hour gets 10-20 more miles per gallon than one traveling at 75 m.p.h. In most states I’ve driven through the cops will give you about 10 m.p.h. over the limit before giving a ticket.Now if national leadership were to request that the states strictly enforce the speed limits but not change them there would be a quick and lasting reduction in fuel consumption. Would the American people go along with this rather painless proposition? I wouldn’t bet on it. Of course there would have to be real national leadership to even try it.Tom Sandusky Spring Hill Fla.: You cannot just propose a huge gas tax. Most people live from paycheck to paycheck. It has to be an integrated approach. First the government has to announce that a gas tax is going to be imposed increasing a small amount per year until you get to a target year in order to give people a chance to adjust. Second along with the increase in gas taxes the government has to increase fuel efficiency standards to help offset the cost of higher taxes.Sam Uretsky Wantagh N.Y.: The importance of developing alternative energy sources can’t be overstated but is a gasoline tax — ultimately a retrogressive tax — the best answer? People with the highest incomes could easily ignore it and continue to drive Hummers. People with low incomes might be unable to afford to buy an alternative fuel vehicle and be penalized. I’m uncertain whether any suitable alternative vehicles are currently available for handicapped conversion. Using tax policy as the prime mover of public policy simply seems like an inappropriate approach.I don’t have an all-purpose solution but a combination of inducements might help. Perhaps an initial tax break could be offered to corporate fleets using alternative fuels along with specifications for alternative fuels to be used in government vehicles at all levels. As these cars enter the used car market they would be more affordable for lower-income individuals thus permitting a gasoline tax to operate in a more equitable manner. Conversion kits might be made available for cars now on the road to permit increased use of biodiesel and gasohol without the need to buy a new vehicle. Increased subsidies for mass transit would also be a plus.It’s a national shame that we didn’t listen to President Carter when he developed an energy plan but perhaps this time we’ll learn.Michael Siteman Agoura Hills Calif.: I agree with you that by raising the tax and therefore creating higher gasoline prices at the pump we create a commercially feasible environment for proliferation of alternative fuels. My only concern regarding increasing the gasoline tax is that the government especially the current administration will squander the additional revenue.Frank Auer Stratford Conn.: You seem to have little concern for the poor and middle classes that have to drive and can’t afford hybrid cars. I drive 60 miles a day for work and others I know would really be hurt by a gas tax. How about a graduated tax on new cars based on mileage? Or putting those oil-company and rich-people tax cuts to use for research? Or eliminating the cuts and using the money for mass transportation improvements? It’s always the poor and middle classes who get stuck being the responsible citizens.Mike Flanigan Chevy Chase Md.: I applaud your focus on raising the gas tax and on our energy policy in general. But I think you should take more care in what you propose as alternatives to imported oil. Today you promoted hybrids that run on biofuels such as ethanol. The last time I looked at the issue a number of studies indicate that if corn is the source of the ethanol it takes more energy to produce a quantity of ethanol than we get out of the product. The other sources of biofuels are really in their infancy.Oliver Patton Alexandria Va.: I have followed your campaign for higher fuel taxes with great interest. It’s an important idea that needs to be fully aired.Two questions:1. How do we know that $4 a gallon will in fact change consumer decision-making? I understand the obvious answer — that people will look for other ways to lower their costs — but maybe that doesn’t happen in a serious way until we’re paying $10 a gallon. I don’t think you can look to European tax policy as an example because their geographic circumstances are so different from ours. My point is: it is critically important that the number be right. If you ask me to double or triple my automotive expenses for a specific cause I expect to see results pretty quickly. Otherwise you’ve got a political donnybrook on your hands. And you need to have agreement on what the federal government will do with all that money. Should all of it go into the Highway Trust Fund — we do need to do something about congestion — or should a portion of it go to say a new nuclear submarine every year or to a new gym for the House of Representatives?2. I also have a question regarding your assertion that we need to stop hitting ourselves in the face by sending money over to oil-exporting nations that either directly or indirectly support the terrorist tactics of radical Islam. I couldn’t agree more. But if we stopped buying oil from those nations tomorrow — stopped cold — it would make no significant difference in their income. Oh there would be a downturn in their revenue for a while but India and China would make up the gap in short order. So the money would still be there. We’d have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not funding our enemies but they’d still be funded. Am I missing something?Richard Moore Albany N.Y.: While I agree with your assessment of the energy crisis and am in favor of a significant increase in the gasoline tax I should point out that I agree because I can afford to agree. It wasn’t that long ago however that I commuted 70 miles round trip because I couldn’t afford a house in or near Princeton N.J. where I worked. Actually few who live in Princeton work in Princeton — business owners and old money exceptions notwithstanding. I now live within walking and biking distance of my work and a tank of gas lasts around a month. But I’m still very concerned about our gluttony for energy.What I believe we need is a two-pronged approach to energy independence. First as you point out a realistic gasoline tax would encourage commuters to carpool or find other means to get to work. This leads me to my second element — put that additional money into improving mass transit and making it easier for people to walk or ride bicycles to their place of business. As I said I can walk to work — but the route is along a heavily-traveled road with cars and trucks whizzing by me an arm’s length away. Why not put down a 6-foot wide asphalt path along every road deemed a commuter route? It would certainly make it easier for me and I’d wager that a great number of people who live even farther out would ride bicycles or walk. And it would be easy. I don’t get it.Anyway that’s my opinion.Kathy Ann Walsh Scottsdale Ariz.: I understand and agree with your logic about the long-range effect that raising the gas tax would have in forcing auto makers to greatly improve fuel efficiency. And I realize that for upper-middle-class people and above it would be a cost they could absorb without too much suffering. But I think there are an awful lot of people in this country who would be devastated by prices that high especially in places that lack decent mass transit. Some of them would not be able to afford to get to their jobs. Some small-business owners like landscapers who must use a vehicle in their businesses would not always be able to pass the cost along to their customers. I don’t think tax breaks for the poor would be quick enough so what else?

9,On Wall Street there are staunch powerful well-connected Democrats committed to the party and to influencing the political process Democrats able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single Presidential candidate. But some of them remain tantalizingly unattached. Call them the Uncommitted Committeds.Paul Carey the Northeast fund-raising director for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas rattles off the current list of uncommitteds: "Let's see Felix we've met with him; Ace Greenberg still searching; Jenrette taking a pass; Larry pass."Translation: Felix Rohatyn the senior partner at Lazard Freres & Company is apparently waiting for Gov. Mario Cuomo's definitive decision. Alan C. Greenberg the chairman of Bear Stearns & Company is said to be waiting until after the primaries. Richard Jenrette chairman and chief executive of the Equitable Assurance Society is not even planning to come in later preoccupied with nursing the insurance company back to health. An aide in his office pleaded: "Please make that very clear." Laurence Tisch chief executive of CBS has said that as owner of a network pledging allegiance to any candidate would be a conflict of interest.Democrats on Wall Street are worried about two things. Bush can't be beaten. Bush can be beaten but not by any of the current candidates. "People will make a contribution but there is less enthusiasm among the Democrats this year" says David Sawyer of the Sawyer Miller Group a New York-based political consulting group. "They will go to the dinners and they will write the checks. But it isn't the same."
9,When New York State officials auction off a winning lottery ticket today it will take more than a dollar and a dream to walk away with the prize. How much more is the question that has been fascinating scores of potential bidders for the last two weeks but the smart money is betting at least $2 million more.The winner of this unusual event will receive $240245 almost immediately and another $3.6 million over the next 15 years. And unlike most state lotteries which tend to attract a lower- and middle-income clientele the auction's ground rules suggest that only the rich will be able to play: the minimum bid is $1.3 million.At that price a successful bidder would be locking in a long-term investment of only modest risk while earning a whopping 21.4 percent a year on the investment -- more than what far riskier investments like Old Masters stocks and gold bullion have historically yielded. Up to $2.4 MillionBut such a return is unlikely since bidders should be able to justify paying far more than $1.3 million lawyers accountants and other financial experts say.

9,The Jets are playing a waiting game with the contract offers they have extended to quarterback Steve DeBerg an unrestricted free agent from Miami and kick returner Brian Mitchell an unrestricted free agent from the Redskins. The Jets would not divulge the terms of the offers they have made to DeBerg and Mitchell.DeBerg who started last season with Tampa Bay and finished with Miami is also negotiating with the Dolphins. Jets General Manager Dick Steinberg said that the DeBerg deal if it is done will not be a "heavy deal" that will adversely affect the team's salary-cap situation."I would say that both teams are close to what he's looking for in terms of a team" said Jack Childers DeBerg's agent referring to the Jets and the Dolphins. "He feels that both teams have an equal possibility of making the playoffs. And as far as winning games both teams are the same. He has high regard for both Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason." An Offer to NagleIf the Jets sign DeBerg Browning Nagle the backup to Esiason last year will have little leverage to negotiate a new deal. The Jets have already made Nagle a restricted free agent a qualifying offer of $825000 in order to retain his rights. If they sign him it will be for considerably less money. Or they might even cut him. The Jets have been looking to trade Nagle but they have not received any offers.

1,When Matt Damon did his Brett Kavanaugh imitation on “Saturday Night Live” you could tell that he nailed it before he said a word. It was all about the face — that sneering rage-filled scowl. Kavanaugh didn’t sound like a judge at his Senate hearing last week  let alone a potential Supreme Court justice; he didn’t even manage to look like one.But then again Lindsey Graham who went through the hearing with pretty much the same expression on his face didn’t look much like a senator either.There have been many studies of the forces driving Trump support and in particular the rage that is so pervasive a feature of the MAGA movement. What Thursday’s hearing drove home however was that white male rage isn’t restricted to blue-collar guys in diners. It’s also present among people who’ve done very well in life’s lottery whom you would normally consider very much part of the elite.In other words hatred can go along with high income and all too often does.At this point there’s overwhelming evidence against the “economic anxiety” hypothesis — the notion that people voted for Donald Trump because they had been hurt by globalization. In fact people who were doing well financially were just as likely to support Trump as people who were doing badly.

9,On the barren stage of the Liberty which looks bombed-out Ms. Shaw is illuminated by only a few unshaded light bulbs and the artfully placed spotlight. The image she creates is mesmerizing as is her fluid control of her slightly husky voice.The performance is mesmerizing but is this really Eliot? And for that matter can such a piece work as theater? Or should it? I think not but that's no excuse not to make the attempt. There is something about the communal nature of theater that contradicts the spirit of Eliot's isolating hallucinatory often impenetrable visions and his densely packed allusions to Shakespeare Milton Virgil Sophocles Verlaine the myth of the Grail and well you name it.''The Waste Land'' is to be read at one's own speed often haltingly as one stops goes back and starts again in this way to gather momentum to make the next leap from the vividly particular to the abstract and apocalyptic. Unless you're a don there's no other way to obtain a purchase on this most complex of modern masterpieces.If you accept these limitations and if you read the text first this ''Waste Land'' is something to which you can pay attention without feeling that you have failed it. You certainly should pay attention to Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner. For some time now they have been stirring up the London theater scene with a succession of celebrated and/or controversial productions including a ''Richard II'' in which Ms. Shaw played the title role and Samuel Beckett's ''Footfalls'' which so outraged the Beckett estate that attempts were made to close it.Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner take their work seriously.'The Rehearsal'There are some very good things in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of ''The Rehearsal'' the witty tartly sentimental Jean Anouilh comedy first produced here in 1963 and now being seen in a fine new English translation by Jeremy Sams. He is the man responsible for the English version of Jean Cocteau's ''Indiscretions'' (better known as ''Les Parents Terribles'') produced on Broadway two seasons ago. Though ''The Rehearsal'' lacks the roaring humor and rue of Anouilh's ''Waltz of the Toreadors'' it is an exceptionally satisfying work. This production directed by Nicholas Martin has beauty style humor and the most cohesive acting ensemble to appear at the Roundabout in some time.''The Rehearsal'' belongs to that group of Anouilh plays in which the artificiality of theater is compared to the artificiality of real life. The setting is post-World War II France and a chateau where some all too sophisticated aristocrats are putting on a production of Marivaux's 1723 classic ''La Double Inconstance'' (''The Inconstant Lovers'') whose tale of innocence betrayed parallels the story of the contemporary play. If you happened to see the splendid Comedie-Francaise production of the Marivaux at the Brooklyn Academy of Music earlier this year your pleasure will be enhanced.The victim of ''The Rehearsal'' is Lucile (Anna Gunn) a sweet unspoiled young woman governess to the orphans who are housed in one of the chateau's more remote wings. The Count (David Threlfall) being bored by both his wife the Countess (Frances Conroy) and his mistress Hortensia (Kathryn Meisle) casts them in supporting roles and asks the governess to play Sylvie Marivaux's heroine who is somewhat more resilient and believable than Lucile.

9,To the Editor:Re "Cabby Made Taste of Democracy Costly" (letter Nov. 28):On one of my first trips to New York City we were meeting friends at the Odeon restaurant. We had taken the bus to where it seemed the restaurant would be close. The numbers on Broadway had got small. Not being from New York I imagined it would turn into West Broadway.We walked south. It was dark late at night and late in the year. We had no map and were nervous to ask strangers where an address was. When we got to Battery Park we realized something had gone wrong. As we walked back up my wife's purse grew in psychological dimensions as did her fears. We could not find a cab. The purse had grown to the size of a billboard. Every potential mugger was after us.From nowhere a cab appeared. I told the driver to take us to our hotel as my wife was so shaken at not being able to find the Odeon restaurant. "The Odeon" he said. "It's less than two blocks from here." As we got out of the cab I realized he hadn't put the meter flag down. "No charge" he said as he drove off into the night.M. BLAIR PESSEMIER Seattle Nov. 28 1995

9,The Japanese Parliament passed a law in 1997 permitting doctors to remove organs from brain-dead patients provided that consent is obtained beforehand and compromised on the definition of death saying that brain-dead patients would be considered dead only if they had specified that they wanted to donate their organs. But the law had not been applied until today's heart transplant which is only the second in Japan's history.Dr. Juro Wada performed the first 31 years ago in an ambiguous legal environment and when the recipient died he was accused of murder. The furor deterred other doctors from attempting similar operations any transplants until the current law permitting transplants went into effect in October 1997.In the years since thousands of people have flown overseas to get transplants or have simply died. Many others simply died because they could not afford surgical procedures abroad or could not get organs overseas in time.Despite the new law many people still wait in vain for transplants because many Japanese remain reluctant to donate their organs. At least seven patients have died while on official waiting lists. In a survey released by the office of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi one-third of those asked said they would like to donate their organs. But only 2.6 percent of them had official donor cards.In the first stage of today's operation doctors at the Kochi Red Cross Hospital in western Japan removed the heart liver and kidneys from the brain-dead patient the nation's first legal organ donor who was in a coma after suffering a stroke and a brain hemorrhage. Details about the donor even sex and age are being kept confidential until after the funeral at the request of the family.

9,Photography introduced a number of new subjects to the pictorial canon and then revised some old ones radically. Refugees for instance: throughout history wars and politically repressive regimes have left refugees in their wake but the search for safe haven and the condition of refugees have seldom been painted. The holy family on the flight to Egypt is the exception a kind of ur representation that usurped all others and did not call for pity alone.Photography in the 20th century changed the picture. Every war and many of the uprisings since World War I have called forth pictures of civilians thronging the crowded and hazardous paths to safety. Compassion is expected of the viewer. In recent times the press and television have been glutted with images of starving emaciated ragged people in wretched camps standing in interminable lines for a bit of sustenance awaiting death with distended stomachs.Horrible as these pictures are they are almost cliches by now. Fazal Sheikh photographs refugees without them. The International Center of Photography showed his photographs of African refugee camps in 1996; what was striking was the dignity of the people who faced Mr. Sheikh's camera not only with utter seriousness but also with a sense of self even perhaps of self-worth that outshone their desperation and seemed to have outlasted self-pity.Since then Mr. Sheikh has photographed Afghans in exile in Pakistan. Pace Wildenstein MacGill Gallery has 53 of these pictures on view in ''Fazal Sheikh: The Victor Weeps.'' (Scalo has published a book of the same title.) Again these are strong sober contemplative and respectful portraits rather than scenes of misery although a few views of the ruins of the Afghan capital Kabul which Mr. Sheikh also managed to visit just before the Taliban moved in make it painfully clear that misery must have been in abundant supply. More than six million people almost half the nation fled Afghanistan during the war and by 1997 some 2.7 million were still in exile.

0,Anyone who has traveled to Europe in the summertime knows that a large chunk of the Continent seems to be on vacation on any given day. This is part of the problem facing the clutch of United States-based private equity firms who are hoping to stage an initial public offering overseas according to a story from Reuters.Buyout shops such as Texas Pacific Group and Blackstone hope to follow the lead of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts which recently raised $5 billion — three times the amount it originally expected — through a listing on the Euronext exchange. But the slow season is coming and no one is sure if investors will be so receptive to a private equity I.P.O. several months from now.One lawyer sums the situation up this way:“If anything the market will determine the appetite for this type of product” said Jeffrey Tabak a lawyer for Weil Gotshal & Manges who specializes in fund raising. “From a timing perspective summer is a more difficult time to raise money especially in Europe. Will the interest still be there after Labor Day?”Meanwhile the anonymous private equity professional who runs the Going Private blog has been offering an interesting rundown of the prospectus for KKR’s European I.P.O. The latest entry describes a handy tax break that KKR discovered in the tiny nation of Luxembourg.Go to Article from Reuters »Go to Item from Going Private »
0,ASIAN composers have in recent years devised ingenious ways to pull elements of their native traditional music into their scores. But Ichiro Nodaira the featured composer in a festival presented next weekend by Music From Japan couldn't care less.In fact Mr. Nodaira makes a convincing case that even in music composition it's perfectly possible to study Western practices and then go out and beat us at our own game. Having spent a dozen formative years in Paris (1978-90) where he composed at the computer-music studio Ircam and served as pianist for the Ensemble Intercontemporain Mr. Nodaira 50 has so thoroughly internalized Western music that he coolly resolves problems most composers either shrug off as too profound to deal with or don't even know they have.His pacing for example an uncanny balancing of the inevitable with the unexpected gives a listener an unusual and palpable sense of overall destination. This might be easy enough to pull off were he something of a pastiche composer but he is not. No phrase deviates from the inflections of his opening measures. What gives you the impression of being carried farther and farther along into places that while stylistically consistent sound utterly new is a careful holding-back of possibilities -- textures say and instrumental juxtapositions -- until their moment of maximum impact.It bespeaks an unusual degree of patience and feel for drama. For if you're just going to let your imagination rip -- and Mr. Nodaira does -- you have to consider the risk that all your inspired textures will eventually cancel themselves out making your piece sound pretty much the same from beginning to end. True some composers want this effect; Mr. Nodaira is evidently not among them. He prefers to strike a balance between inventiveness and restraint.

9,In months of analyzing hundreds of Vietnamese archival photographs the Pentagon has been able to resolve with any certainty only four new cases of Americans unaccounted for since the war.In all cases the servicemen have been confirmed dead officials said and the families have been told. Analysts are close to identifying at least another three others according to the Pentagon but the photographs have yielded more clues than conclusions.Pentagon officials said that so far none of the material had indicated that any Americans survived the war in captivity.Working at the headquarters of the Defense Intelligence Agency in Arlington Va. a team is trying to identify some of the more than 2260 Americans the United States says are unaccounted for. More than half are known to have died but their bodies have not been recovered. There are varying degrees of information some of it contradictory about the rest. American Team to Vietnam

8,To the Editor:Williamson M. Evers (''Does America Need a 'G.I. Bill' for Youth?'' Op-Ed April 15) argues that Senator Sam Nunn's plan to make student aid conditional on one or two years of service to the state would if enacted ''revive the concept of indentured servitude a form of bondage in Colonial America.'' He adds ''Hundreds of thousands of young people would become 20th-century indentured students.''If Mr. Evers were right the Nunn plan would be not only bad policy but also unconstitutional. The 13th Amendment (1865) prohibits not only chattel ''slavery'' but also any other form of ''involuntary servitude.'' The latter words were included to outlaw any vestiges of indentured bondage inherited from Colonial American law and the similar system of peonage in the Territory of New Mexico inherited from Spanish and Mexican law. In 1867 Congress passed the antipeonage law still on our statute books (42 United States Code s 1994) which enforces the 13th Amendment by making null and void all laws enforcing the ''service or labor of any persons . . . in liquidation of any debt or obligation or otherwise.''The flaw in Mr. Evers's thesis is its confusion of two radically different phenomena: (1) the state's compelling the performance by the servant of a contract for personal service to pay off a debt previously incurred and (2) the offer of a future benefit (a college education) in return for the completion of voluntary service in a national program.The first is a description of involuntary servitude which is prohibited by the 13th Amendment. The second which features neither debt nor compulsion is the essence of the Nunn plan. The difference between the two is vital: an indentured servant like a New Mexican peon could not walk off his job with impunity. If he did the authorities could recapture him put him back to work and if he refused put him in jail. Under Senator Nunn's plan a voluntarily participating would-be college student would be free to drop out of the program at any time. CYRIL C. MEANS JR. New York April 15 1989
9,To the Editor:Much as children must at some time realize that their parents are not infallible entities so the American people must abandon their inappropriate illusion that statesmen and stateswomen indeed any public figure should serve as role models (letters Dec. 30). These individuals have jobs to do not illusions to fulfill. Parents' expectation that public figures should act as role models is only further shirking their own role.Our President committed a lamentable personal mistake. We do not have the right to feel personally betrayed. That is the private domain of Mr. Clinton's family.SUSAN HACKETTJOHN STRANONorwalk Conn. Dec. 30 1998

0,Alan Nero Hernandez's agent said all of the offers he had received were for one year in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million. The last time he was a free agent in 1999 Hernandez signed a contract with Milwaukee that paid him $10 million for three years plus the $25000 bonus he earned for making the 2002 National League All-Star team.''What has happened'' Nero said ''is this market from the players' point of view is very depressed. Players have to decide whether they want to take massive paycuts or wait their turn. In Jose's case he feels he's coming off a career year and he doesn't feel he should have to take a paycut.''The Mets San Francisco Colorado and Cincinnati are the teams that have pursued Hernandez 33.Steve Phillips the Mets' general manager will not discuss negotiations with a particular player but it is clear he wants to put together the left side of his infield as cheaply as possible. He signed Rey Sanchez -- for a $1.3 million salary and the chance to earn $700000 in bonuses based on playing time -- to keep shortstop warm for José Reyes. He would like to get Hernandez for a similar total.The Mets had Bill Mueller on their list of prospective third basemen but he lost interest in them when Phillips would offer no more than one year. A report circulated among general managers and agents yesterday that Mueller had agreed to a two-year $4.5 million contract with Boston but Mueller's agent Dave Meier said they had no deal. ''We're talking to them but we're not there yet'' he said.Dan O'Dowd the Rockies' general manager acknowledged that he had been talking with Nero about Hernandez. Asked about the low similar offers Hernandez received O'Dowd said: ''I can only speak for ourselves. We just don't have a whole lot of money to work with.''
0,Mr. Black has sent mixed signals about newspapers. In April he said he wanted to sell his Canadian weeklies and smaller dailies. But with today's announcement he is selling newspapers that dominate some of Canada's most important markets including The Ottawa Citizen The Gazette of Montreal The Calgary Herald The Edmonton Sun and The Vancouver Province.If the sale goes through as expected in late September Mr. Black 55 will have tailored his press fief to ownership of newspapers in prestige cities that he cares about: The Daily Telegraph in London The Jerusalem Post and The Chicago Sun-Times. As for his pet Canadian project The National Post a Toronto-based newspaper that in less than two years of existence has added a muscular conservative voice to Canada's intellectual debate Mr. Black is to become the newspaper's chairman for five years and Hollinger is to retain management control. CanWest will own 50 percent of this newspaper.Mr. Black was on vacation in Europe and did not return telephone calls left at his Toronto and New York offices. But in his press statement he seemed to expect criticism.''There continues to be an audible body of opinion that holds that the newspaper industry has entered a period of stagnation or even decline'' said Mr. Black who is Hollinger's chairman. ''We strenuously disagree with this and look forward to demonstrating both the fallacy of this view and the enduring vitality of quality newspaper assets intelligently managed and imaginatively linked with other media.''Don Babick The Post publisher declined in an interview to predict how the marriage of electronic and print media would happen saying only ''We are blending ourselves with a first-class national telecaster.''The deal would strengthen the news-gathering capacity of CanWest making it ''far and away the leading Canadian media operation'' said Mr. Dornan a former television journalist. ''These guys are going to have the most robust news rooms in every single market in the country.''CanWest estimated that the combined strengths of the merged operations could save the company up to $100 million a year.

0,It has been more than a decade since Leslie King and 11 other jurors in Brooklyn acquitted Lemrick Nelson Jr. of murder and manslaughter charges in the fatal stabbing of Yankel Rosenbaum. But Ms. King said yesterday that she was not surprised to hear that lawyers for Mr. Nelson who is being tried for the third time in connection with the attack on Mr. Rosenbaum in Crown Heights in 1991 are now changing course and saying that he did in fact participate.''We weren't saying he had nothing to do with it'' she said of Mr. Nelson whose lawyers during the two earlier trials said just that. ''We just couldn't match the charges to the evidence we were given.''Ms. King 35 said she and her fellow jurors knew Mr. Nelson then 16 was nearby when Mr. Rosenbaum was attacked by an angry crowd and stabbed to death on Aug. 19 1991 a few hours after a Hasidic Jew ran over and killed a 7-year-old black child.The jurors also knew there was ''a good chance'' Mr. Nelson was directly involved in the stabbing Ms. King said.
9,Mr. Grigorovich remains artistic director for the main Bolshoi company a post he has held since 1964. He said he intended to feature one or two established figures from the Bolshoi regularly like Nadezhda Pavlova who is traveling with the new company but otherwise the new company will be made up of young artists some with no professional experience. Doing What They WantMost of all Mr. Grigorovich said the troupe he formed over the summer is a bid to break away from the Soviet cultural bureaucracy and to exploit the new economic freedoms."We will put on real Bolshoi performances" he said "but we will be free to do what we want. We can keep dancers or sack them if they do not suit the company because they are under contract and we pay them with our money. If we can sell ourselves good; if not too bad."If nothing else Texas A & M provided the Grigorovich company with the commercial support it desperately needed to get off the ground. Hundreds of people camped out overnight by the box office before tickets went on sale and all but one of nine performances at the 2500-seat Rudder Auditorium have sold out.The company has performed "The Nutcracker" and a mixed bill called "The Best of the Bolshoi" here. After its final performance Saturday the troupe is scheduled to go to Miami to put on the mixed bill at the Jackie Gleason Performing Arts Center from Tuesday to Friday. In New York from Dec. 19 to Dec. 30 it will perform "The Nutcracker" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.This version of Tchaikovsky's Christmas ballet has not been performed in the United States since the Bolshoi Ballet closed the old Metropolitan Opera House on a night in 1966.

0,Hensher is a 37-year-old English novelist and reviewer who has a column in The Independent and has been a Booker Prize judge. He tells us in an afterword that the novelist A. .S Byatt urged him to write a long novel and he's made it in homage to the 19th century's literary greats. Couched in their accents riven with their preoccupations and perceptions ''The Mulberry Empire'' descends on London drawing rooms Crimean estates and oriental palaces in the very language of Victorian novelists.If there is something immediately odd about the atmosphere it's because Hensher imitates Thackeray writing about the division of rich and poor in Victorian London; he imitates Kipling writing about the gorgeous East; imitates -- who? Gissing I fancy -- writing about a literary cove called Stokes. In the Russian scenes I expected for a moment that he would try to scale the hare-coursing of ''War and Peace'' but it was only a nod and he elegantly sheered away toward the Crimean estates (their versts their town of S- their contented landlords). Hensher also imitates Conrad on the sea: ''Even when the winds started up again -- and it was as astonishing as imprevue an event as their disappearance -- we still felt becalmed marooned suspended in time.''Hensher's ventriloquism slides the novel into a sort of liminal space between reader and writer -- a space like Afghanistan itself devoured by Western eyes unwittingly besieged by Western dreams that lead to blunders retreats and surprise attacks coming down off the old brown hills with armies like narratives coursing through the defiles. Hensher is alive to the ironies of the historical novel. As they say the past is another country; it's also a country like Afghanistan as it once was: you can't go there. We know too little about the place but at the same time we know too much. We are burdened with hindsight.''He looked up into the utter clarity of the Afghan sky and saw something he had never seen before; a single cloud . . . a single brilliantly white line shining with the reflected sun being drawn as if with a piece of chalk. Burnes looked at it never having seen it before. Far above tens of thousands of feet above a jet plane was tearing across the sky. He looked: and to his mind came a single dictionary thought: disaster. . . . What it meant he did not know.''It happens once this eruption into the present day and it's enough to catch the reader offguard with his guilty knowledge. Hensher sets out to disturb our assumptions and keep us guessing. ''There is no power in the world even the cruellest and most arbitrary which does not believe itself to be merciful compassionate and wise'' says a delightfully enigmatic guide named Mohan Lal to his English employer Burgess. ''We are men of the world are we not? We both know that to seduce an intelligent woman we comment on her beauty; to lay siege to a beautiful woman it is best to compliment her on her intelligence. . . . Come now Burnes-ji; you believe what you are told because it is what you like to hear.''

9,A new study has bolstered the belief that past head injuries may be related to Alzheimer's disease scientists said yesterday.The study conducted at the University of Washington in Seattle compared the head trauma history of 130 patients who had Alzheimer's disease with a comparison group of the same number of people in which there had been no clinical diagnosis of the disease. The researchers found that Alzheimer patients were three and a half times as likely to have suffered head injuries.The relationship of injury to Alzheimer's held true even when the injury occurred decades before the onset of the debilitating mind-destroying disease according to the report in the March issue of The American Journal of Epidemiology.The reason was unclear but the researchers speculated that it might relate to brain cell damage or to injury to the blood-brain barrier which prevents almost all substances in the blood from entering brain tissue.

8,''THE LIVING PLANET: A Portrait of the Earth'' the much acclaimed series from Britain arrives on public television Sunday night. In it David Attenborough looks at the world and finds it inviting. In the first of 12 episodes he shows us how the earth was formed how continents moved and how flora and fauna proliferated. We have seen this on television before of course but Mr. Attenborough's series is special. For one thing it looks spectacular; for another there is Mr. Attenborough blessed with a quirky charm. The first episode ''The Building of the Earth'' will be seen on Channel 13 at 7 P.M.Thus we begin in the Himalayas in the ''deepest valley in the world.'' Mr. Attenborough is our guide a job he takes seriously. We may not smell the rhododendrons in the valley but certainly we know they're there. Mr. Attenborough trudging through the valley is interested in everything: flowers monkeys trees pheasants with ''the burnished metallic iridescence of tropical butterflies'' Sherpas plowing with yaks.At the same time it's the big picture he's after. How did these wonders come about? Mr. Attenborough stands on a hilltop panting heavily. The thin air and the hike have gotten to him. We're concerned that he's all done in. Not to worry however; soon he is showing us a fossilized shell. He says it is a sign that the Himalayas were once under the sea.Cut then to a great wall of flame. ''I'm in Iceland now'' Mr. Attenborough says. He is standing in front of a volcano and wind is ruffling his hair. Much of ''The Living Planet'' is full of transitions like that. We are on one continent and then another. Sometimes Mr. Attenborough follows; other times we just hear his voice. From Iceland we go to Ireland and then to the Hebrides. We hear Mr. Attenborough all the while although we don't see him again until Krakatoa.
9,To the Sports Editor:I read with sympathy about Jeff Hostetler's putting his playing career on hold (''Hostetler Puts Focus on Paralyzed Son'' The Times July 25) after his son had a serious accident riding on a recreational vehicle.

9,Japanese officials moved closer today to stating that the Government would agree to a slight opening of Japan's rice market if that was necessary to conclude a new global trade treaty.The Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato said at a news conference today that Japan might eventually make a "political decision" to make a concession so as not to jeopardize the current round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.The statement was one of the strongest indications to date that the Government was ready to reverse its official stance of trying to maintain a ban on imported rice.Meanwhile Asahi Shimbun a major Japanese newspaper reported this morning that the Government had already essentially decided to remove the prohibition on rice imports. The newspaper said the Government had found it impossible to persuade other nations to allow Japan to maintain its closed market which Japan has argued is necessary to assure self-sufficiency in its staple food.

9,Although Gulko was at 47 the oldest player in the tourney he surely did not play like it. His overall performance level was very high and his games featured some nice combinations. In the eighth round he went through the redoubtable Kaidanov like a buzz saw.With 3 . . . Nf6 Kaidanov transposed into a gambit that also arises in the Center-Counter Game after 1 e4 d5 2 ed Nf6 3 c4 c6. Although it has never been demonstrated that White clearly gets the worst of it after 4 dc Nc6 5 d3 e5 6 Nc3 Bf5 7 Nf3 Bb4 8 Be2 e4 9 de Qd1 10 Kd1 O-O-O 11 Kc2 Ne4 everyone nowadays shies away from it. Gulko accepted the received opinion by declining the pawn offer with 4 d4. And after 4 . . . cd 5 Nc3 e6 6 Nf3 the game settled into a main line of the Semi-Tarrasch Defense.The chief feature of the position after 7 cd Nd5 is the isolated d4 pawn. It has always been supposed to offer White some chances for a mating attack because it makes possible superior control of central space. But such an outspoken theoretician as the Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen insists that anything White has is nebulous. He further concludes that Black's strategy of defending his way into an advantageous endgame should prevail.The move 10 . . . Bf6 is one of the preferred courses of completing Black's development. Most attention has gone into 11 Be4 Nce7 12 Ne5 g6 13 Bh6 Bg7 14 Bg7 Kg7 15 Qf3 with a slight advantage in freedom of movement for White. But perhaps 11 a3 which Gulko uses in this game is stronger. For one thing reduction of material with 11 . . . Nd4 12 Nd4 Bd4 13 Bh7 Kh7 14 Qd4 Nc3 15 Qc3 f6 16 Be3 does not solve Black's problems: his king is a bit exposed and White retains a lead in development.The trouble with Kaidanov's 11 . . . Bd7 12 Bc2 Rc8 13 Ne4 Be7 14 Qd3 g6 was its passivity; its threat of 15 . . . Ncb4 16 ab Nb4 was stopped by 15 Bd2. And 15 . . . Qb6 robbed the black position of flexibility: a timely Nc5 could not be prevented by . . . b6. Gulko's 16 b4 seized queenside space without diminishing his chances for attack against the black king.
8,Unusually spirited and rythmically alert Bach playing was the unifying thread of a stimulating organ recital by Kei Koito at the Church of St. John the Evangelist Monday evening.Miss Koito played four works of the Thomaskantor - an early Vivaldi concerto transcription (BWV 593) the canonic variations on ''Vom Himmel hoch'' (BWV 769) the Trio Sonata in C minor (BWV 526) and the Prelude and Fugue in E flat (BWV 552) - with brilliant contrasts of registration (almost but never quite gaudy) and with a motoric swing that sometimes called to mind the Bach interpretations of Glenn Gould. Miss Koito is by no means alone in her application of a lean often non legato style to these works but her presentation of it was particularly fresh.She played the adagio of the Vivaldi arrangement with a blunt measured tread and hollow timbres; the variations brought singing fluency and deft ornamentation. The big final piece began with majestic pacing but in a way that remained relatively brisk and bright; the fugue was begun in severe colors that gave way to a sort of crescendo of registrational variety.Interspersed with the Bach were three new pieces all of them announced as New York premieres. Henri Pousseur's ''Deuxieme Vue sur les Jardins Interdits'' explored contrasts of timbre and confrontations of dissonance with pastiche consonance; it seemed limited by a stop-and-go character. Episodic construction though did not undermine the charm of Eric Gaudibert's ''Jetees'' a partly aleatory work of great variety; my favorite section was one in which pretty tweety high beepings cavorted with an Alberich-like bassoon stop below. Giacinto Scelsi's ''In Nomine Lucis'' built wild-sounding tone clusters into a vague chaotic climax and dwindled; it sounded primitive but stirring.
0,Thorncrown is tall and narrow built of glass wood and stone. Mr. Jones used a stabilizing device believed to be new at the time crossed-wood bracing near the ceiling running most of the length of the building. Each brace is two lengths of two-by-four lumber joined by hollow steel joints that produce "a diamond fretwork of light" that creates "the illusion of infinity" Mr. Ivy writes.One of Mr. Jones's most ambitious projects was not completed. Tom Monaghan the founder of Domino's Pizza commissioned a palatial house at Ann Arbor Mich. in 1988. Four years into the project with construction well under way and with $3 million to $4 million already spent by Mr. Jones's estimate Mr. Monaghan suddenly halted the project. He had just read C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" and was stricken by a chapter on greed. He shifted his attention to building a Roman Catholic college in Florida.Mr. Jones designed 135 houses and 15 chapels and churches in 20 states from California to Massachusetts and from Florida to Colorado. Most were in Arkansas. He designed an assortment of other structures including fountains gardens pavilions and commercial buildings. He once designed an auto repair shop but the brothers who owned the business quarreled before it was built.Besides Thorncrown his other well-known sacred structures include the Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel in Bella Vista Ark. and the Marty Leonard Chapel in Fort Worth.Mr. Jones had no interest in skyscrapers but he did drafting work on one the Price Tower in Bartlesville Okla. when he was apprenticed to Wright.Euine Fay Jones was born on Jan. 31 1921 at Pine Bluff Ark. to Euine Fay Jones and Candy Louise Alston Jones. He grew up in El Dorado Ark. where his parents moved to run a restaurant. As a boy he liked to draw and to build treehouses. One burned when a spark from its brick fireplace escaped. He became interested in architecture when he saw a movie short subject in 1938 on Wright's new Johnson's Wax headquarters in Racine Wis.He studied engineering for two and a half years at the University of Arkansas then earned a degree in its new architecture program in 1950. He received a master's degree in 1951 at Rice University in Houston. Two years earlier at an A.I.A. convention in Houston a chance encounter with Wright led to a lasting connection. His first Taliesin Fellowship was in 1953.

9,He regrets allowing himself to be drawn into partisan political battles like the one he touched off when he criticized Geraldine A. Ferraro on abortion. He regrets that he denounced Salman Rushdie without having even read ''The Satanic Verses.'' Most of all John Cardinal O'Connor says he regrets being so ''arrogant'' that he talked incessantly to the ever-insatiable news media offering opinions on subjects he knew little about.''I said some dumb things'' said the most forceful and influential Archbishop of New York in a generation. ''The press could have asked me about satellites to Mars and I would have given them an answer.''As he approaches his 77th birthday on Jan. 15 the Cardinal sounds very much like a man preparing to close out his career. He is after all two years beyond the official retirement age for bishops reason enough for introspection.But despite periodic eruptions of speculation about his future the Cardinal has no plans to go anywhere just yet. He still loves his job he feels fine and he notes that he has assignments from the Vatican through 1997. His future is up to the Pope who asked him to stay on past his 75th birthday and has not said anything about retirement or succession.

0,The Jews Are Not the Only People Who Built the Tombs of the Prophets"At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?" Abraham Lincoln asked the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield Illinois early in 1838. He was just short of twenty-nine a first-term representative in the state legislature; he was addressing a self-improvement society.Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe Asia and Africa combined with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Buonaparte for a commander could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years.He went back to his question: "At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide."Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.From long before Lincoln's time up to our own and certainly past it pious and self-promoting denunciations of the corruptions breeding within the republic have been and will be part of the republic's speech: Unless we rid ourselves of this stain those parasites this perversion these impostors of virtue who claim to speak in our name-then doom goes the litany and deservedly so. The old story-and the heart of what Lincoln was to talk about that night. He was right as anyone is right when he or she raises this flag. But finally after more than a century and a half during which the United States became a world power and then the most powerful nation in the world he was proven wrong."U.S. Attacked" read the headline in the New York Times on 12 September 2001 and it was a remarkable choice of words. It was no matter that the attackers were not Lincoln's army of Europe Asia or Africa but a mere nineteen Muslim terrorists directed from a mountain retreat in Afghanistan. The writer understood that a brilliantly planned conspiracy an almost perfectly executed astonishingly spectacular assault the hijacking and then smashing of planes into the two towers of the World Trade Center in New York a third into the Pentagon with the last plane headed for the Capitol brought down in Pennsylvania by its passengers after they learned what had already happened was first of all symbolic. The writer understood that the deaths of thousands of people going about their business whatever that might be were necessary to validate the symbolism and that the intent of the perpetrators was to instantly reveal mere buildings as representative of the country and thus symbolically enact the destruction of the nation itself. More starkly more truthfully than any of those who over the next days and weeks gave speeches wrote essays or delivered sermons whoever composed the headline captured all this as if in a two-word poem.More than any other place on earth America can be attacked through its symbols because it is made up. It is a construct an idea and as from the beginning to this day it is still seeking to construct to shape whoever finds himself or herself on its ground. The nation exists as power but its only legitimacy is found in a few pieces of paper. Take away the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and perhaps various public speeches that lie behind those documents or pass them on and as a nation you have little more than a collection of buildings and people who have no special reason to speak to each other and nothing to say.If the nation is a construct though as it was made up it can be unmade; the September terrorists may have understood that. As a construct America exists by means of its symbols and if those symbols are destroyed-destroy one destroy them all the American way buy one get one free-the idea is suddenly exposed as nothing more than that. A few agreements made more than two centuries ago make up the contract that binds all Americans to each other and to the nation as such which is to say they are all that binds them that they are all the nation is. The notion that people can validate themselves through a few words denying tyranny affirming equality and insisting that any individual has rights no power can grant or take away-what we call freedom-is itself as much a symbol as it is a way of life and so it too can be attacked as a symbol. It's a crude backward reading-If your power can be denied so terribly and so swiftly what is the power of your idea?-though not so far from our own primitive backward translation: Behold our power tremble before our idea. In their emptiness both versions make plain how unlikely and odd the idea is.The idea is that of a country inventing itself staging the old play about a chosen people and their covenant with their god-but as the country took shape and announced itself as a nation the ground shifted. America became a country that was a nation because it had made a covenant with itself. It made certain promises about who its citizens might be how they might live and for what purposes. Though the blessings of God were called upon and intimations of his judgment summoned it was never about God. If the country betrayed its promises it would betray itself; each citizen would find himself or herself betrayed by every other.(Continues...)

1,The dainty slippers pictured on the cover of “Women’s Work” may have been a marketing ploy on the part of the publisher but the image is so precious so trite and so likely to backfire that it deserves extra points for sheer perversity. Anyone who picks up Megan K. Stack’s new book anticipating a gentle meditation on domestic life will be swiftly disabused within the first 20 pages when Stack describes in (legitimately) excruciating detail her experience of going into labor with her first child. “I distinctly felt my hip bones dragging themselves apart” she writes. “My skeleton was being dismantled.”Stack formerly a war correspondent for The Los Angeles Times left her plum journalism job in 2011 full of expectation for the child she was about to have and the second book she planned to write. “I imagined long silent afternoons in spotless rooms typing clean lines of prose while the baby napped beatifically in a sunbeam” she recalls.Needless to say life as a new parent wasn’t so obliging — even if she and her husband Tom a journalist himself could easily afford to outsource most of the domestic work in Beijing where they lived. They hired a woman to watch their son and clean the house and cook the meals; a few years later when Stack was pregnant with their second child and the family moved to Delhi for Tom’s job they employed two women at once to do the same things.Memoirs about motherhood are exceedingly common but “Women’s Work” dares to explore the labor arrangements that often make such books possible. It brought to mind “My Hollywood” Mona Simpson’s excellent novel about the knotty bond between a composer and the Filipina caregiver she hires. As Stack herself admits — in an author’s note that’s as ruthlessly and relentlessly self-aware as the rest of her book — she had little in common with the women she employed. “They were poor women brown women migrant women” she writes. “And at first I pushed them to the edge of thought. They were important to me primarily because they made me free.”

Specifically the law firm has agreed to pay $30 million to settle all the estate’s legal claims against Vinson & Elkins.

1,TAMPA Fla. — Don’t tell Skip Holtz that college athletics is broken and can’t be fixed. Holtz whom I wrote about in advance of South Florida’s game Saturday in South Bend Ind. walked on at Notre Dame to play football and he continues to regard college sports much as he did then: as a privilege that affords the lucky few an opportunity to compete and be part of something bigger than themselves.“I’ve been around the game my whole life and I think it’s very healthy right now” he said. “I hate that all you’re hearing about are the negative stories. There are a million personal stories of people overcoming great adversity and odds to earn a degree stories of young men that come here with zero father figures and gain the tools to be successful parents successful contributors to society.”Holtz 47 told a story one of many that affirms daily he said his decision to choose coaching over the corporate world. There was a player on one of his teams who was the first in his family to attend college. During his senior season the player abruptly announced he was quitting Holtz said. As he explained the thought of living his whole life as he had his time in college — with his days tightly scheduled with commitments and responsibilities — was too daunting. He could return home he told Holtz and hang out with his friends and life would be so much easier.The player reconsidered Holtz said completed his degree and now is a high school coach.“I don’t like hearing what we can’t do” Holtz said. “I don’t like hearing about the problems. I want to hear about the solutions. The only way to overcome the problems is to find the positives.”Among the positives for Holtz are the nonscholarship players for whom he has a special affinity. He believes their energy and passion are infectious. He showed how much he values the effort of his walk-ons by rewarding one wide receiver Stephen Bravo-Brown with an athletic scholarship for this school year. Bravo-Brown made the 2010 roster as a freshman and played in all 13 games.“I think what you learn as a walk-on is nothing’s given to you” Holtz said. “You’ve got to earn it you’ve got to work for it you’ve got to be positive when nobody else believes in you.”Holtz’s message is simple: How you get to college isn’t important; it’s what you do once you’re there that will define you.
1,After getting off to a typically rocky start in the non-conference portion of their schedule the Siena Saints are now once again steamrolling through the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference winning all 12 league games to date by an average margin of 13.3 points.As the wins pile up it becomes more and more evident that Siena’s Class of 2010 will go down in the record books as the college’s most productive group.The seniors Ronald Moore Edwin Ubiles and Alex Franklin have been at the heart of Siena’s back-to-back M.A.A.C. regular-season and tournament titles a feat never before accomplished in the program’s history. And they seem to be on target to make it three straight. With 6 more points by Moore all will be 1000-point scorers and Moore is also on pace to become Siena’s career assists leader. Over four seasons the class has won a program record-tying 89 games including the last 32 in a row at home. (Franklin missed two of the wins as a sophomore and Ubiles has missed three this year due to injuries.)Dubbed The Maestro and known best for his N.C.A.A. tournament heroics against Ohio State last March Moore is the point guard who makes Siena’s offense sing.“He is the best I’ve ever had at engineering victory” Coach Fran McCaffery said after a recent game. “We’ve got a shot at 100 wins with him bringing it down. He just has an uncanny ability to know what we need to win.”Ubiles is a silky smooth swingman who can make scoring look effortless.“A pleasure to coach” McCaffery said. “Great attitude. Great feel for the game. Plays multiple positions and just makes plays. The thing that he’s developed since he’s come here is the ability to play defense. Now he’s a lock-down defender on top of being a great offensive talent.”Franklin is a versatile forward who McCaffery referred to as a ‘tweener.“He’s a matchup nightmare because he can dribble the ball and break the press” he said. “He can shot-fake drive. He does have a mid-range jump shot. And then he’s an absolute beast on the glass and in the post area offensively. But he also has a great demeanor on the floor. He’s a phenomenal competitor without ever losing control of his emotions. I’ve never seen him come unglued.“Same holds true for the other two as well. They just never come apart with their emotions. I think together they blend well if you look at their skill sets but I think their personalities also blend well together.”BUILDING A CLASSThe construction on the Class of 2010 began at a time when there was very little buzz surrounding Siena’s basketball program. McCaffery was hired in 2005 after the team had gone 6-24 the previous season. Players were in the process of transferring out or were pondering it. One thing McCaffery could offer recruits was playing time.Ubiles a Poughkeepsie native was the first to commit as Siena had actually targeted him prior to McCaffery’s arrival.“Coach Mac came in and told me that he’s gonna turn the program around” said Ubiles noting that he had also been considering Seton Hall and Rhode Island. “After I came on my Siena visit I didn’t even bother taking any other visits. I committed right after my visit and it was all because what he told me and he believed in me. I trusted him and he told me I was going to play right away. That’s all I really wanted to be able to do — go to a school where I was gonna be able to play and not have to play behind somebody or wait for somebody to leave.”McCaffery was thrilled to get such a heavily recruited player.“We felt like when we signed him O.K. now we may have turned the corner with a player who has a chance to be special” he said.Next came Franklin a Pennsylvania native and the cousin of the former N.B.A. player Donyell Marshall.“Coach told me that I was going to come in and contribute right away and that was big” said Franklin who also had interest from La Salle and Virginia Commonwealth among others. “He let me know that he was turning the program around and I’d be a major impact in doing that.”Moore another Pennsylvania product whose brother Chuck played at Seton Hall and Vanderbilt was the last to commit.“I decided to make my decision in late December and it was mainly I just heard so much stuff about Fran” said Moore who had drawn interest primarily from smaller programs. “I could come in right away and play.”What’s ironic is that while many now consider Moore the most indispensable of the three he was the easiest to land.“His recruiting story was interesting because he didn’t have a lot of interest” from other schools McCaffery recalled.He originally had not planned to recruit a point guard in the class before he got an e-mail message from Moore’s high school coach.“I told his coach I’d be coming down to take a peek at him and then I did” he said. “We offered him; he visited a week later and he committed. So he was one of the easier recruits we’ve ever had.”The Siena radio analyst and former player Tom Huerter thinks the Class of 2009 star Kenny Hasbrouck should also be mentioned as a key to building the Class of 2010.“He was the first to believe in Fran and then the other guys fell into place” Huerter said. “If Fran doesn’t have Kenny — Edwin Alex and Ronald — all three of them don’t come. Definitely not Edwin and Alex. Ronald may because he was a late recruit and he wasn’t as highly recruited but Edwin and Alex don’t come unless you have a player like Kenny Hasbrouck.”THE BEST EVER?At least three recruiting classes previous to 2010 might be mentioned in any debate about Siena’s best ever although only two of them merit serious consideration.The most recent is the Class of 2002. Prior to last March that was the lone class to play in two N.C.A.A. tournaments. However the team that made the second trip had a losing record and the only player of any real note in the class was Dwayne Archbold. No one could strongly argue it stacks up with the Class of 2010.Huerter is well acquainted with Siena’s recruiting classes since the late 1980s and agreed to make class comparisons.“Dwayne was a great player” Huerter said. “Tough kid from the city; loved him. He was a gamer and I think from that class to this senior class he was the toughest kid in the bunch but with Edwin being equally as skilled putting up bigger numbers and having more wins in his career the difference maker to me is that you throw in Ronald Moore and Alex Franklin. I would say this class 2010 is better than that class 2002.”A more formidable challenger would be the Class of 2000 the only previous class with three 1000-point scorers in Marcus Faison Jim Cantamessa and Corey Osinski. In tandem with the Class of 2002 they too won back-to-back M.A.A.C. regular-season crowns but in the second of those years did not cap it off with a tournament title and had to settle for an appearance in the N.I.T. Nor did they ever win a game in the N.C.A.A. tournament — let alone the two won so far by the Class of 2010. One thing 2000’s class does have in its favor is the program’s only player to lead the nation in a major statistical category. Cantamessa sported the country’s best 3-point shooting percentage in 1997-98. But with Moore currently leading the nation in assists per game that advantage may soon disappear.“I think athletically this class is far better” Huerter said in referring to the Class of 2010 relative to the Class of 2000. “I think that class played in the right system under Paul Hewitt. They were in great shape and they would just keep shooting until their arms fell off. I don’t think they were considered a strong defensive team because of the points per game they gave up but they were strong enough in that they outscored you. But again I would give the nod to this team because of the wins. You just have to look at the victories.”From that perspective the toughest challenger would have to be the Class of 1991. This group included the point guard deluxe Marc Brown Siena’s career leader in points assists and victories who is almost universally regarded as the best player in Saints history. Brown led Siena to three regular-season league titles the college’s first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament appearance and win in 1989 and its first N.I.T. victories in 1991. The class also featured a couple of solid role players in Steve Downey and Huerter himself and won its first 26 home games — a record before it was surpassed this season thanks largely to the Class of 2010.So who’s better?“From a potential standpoint Class of ’91” Huerter said. “Steve Downey had more potential than any player in Siena history and I will say that going back to the ‘50s ‘60s even though I didn’t see a lot of those guys. And then you add in Marc Brown who was our career leading scorer.“That was also a different time period. When we were beating teams we were beating teams with senior All-Americans. We were competing against a La Salle program that had three N.B.A. players on their team. You didn’t have kids jumping out of high school to go to the N.B.A. You didn’t have underclassmen leaving after one or two years. You had developed 22- 23-year-old men that we were playing against.“It’s a good argument. I will be biased and be honest and say I think the Class of ’91 was better but I would say that this class would be just a half step behind. But at the end of the season if this team goes to the N.C.A.A. tournament again I may give them the nod because it still comes down to winning and they’ve been able to do that on the biggest stage.”How about a second opinion hypothetically pitting the players from each class against each other head to head?“It’s a different era. You never know” said Brown who is now the head coach at New Jersey City University. “Tom would have a little trouble guarding Ubiles because he’s creative with the ball but Tom’s toughest and Ubiles would have definitely had to go outside and defend Tom’s jump shot. Steve Downey — Franklin couldn’t guard Steve Downey he’s a 7-footer. He’s a tough kid but he’s too undersized. And Moore would be in trouble. That’s all I have to say.”That’s all? Nothing more on Moore?“He’s a good player” Brown said. “I love the way he pushes the ball and he really controls the game.”FEBRUARY AND MARCHThere’s still a lot more the Class of 2010 can accomplish in its final two months.With Siena currently on a national-best 13-game winning streak a triumph Friday against Iona would tie the program’s Division I record for most consecutive wins set during the 1988-89 season. Whenever the next victory comes the college’s modern record for most wins over a four-year period will be broken at 90. Reaching the 100 wins McCaffery mentioned will be difficult but it’s not out of the question.Later this month the Saints will play in the marquee BracketBusters matchup at Butler where a win could potentially do wonders for the team’s N.C.A.A. tournament seeding and perhaps even assure an at-large bid should one be needed.Individually Moore is a virtual lock to break Brown’s career assist record and top his own single-season mark set last year in the process. Ubiles could join Brown and Doremus Bennerman as Siena’s third 2000-point scorer although that has become less likely with Ubiles missing games due to injury.In March the Saints will try to parlay their home dominance into a third straight M.A.A.C. tournament championship in Albany where it will not return for at least five years.Should that effort prove successful Siena could then take aim at its first ever N.C.A.A. Round of 16 appearance — an achievement that would justify the preseason hype.Stay tuned.The bonus: Haven’t had enough class comparisons? No problem. Two more from the “coulda been” category coming right up.From a sheer talent standpoint the Class of 2008 ranked with the Class of 2010 but Siena got little return on it due to a rash of transfers. Al Fisher and Jack McClinton played one year at Siena before leaving when the former coach Rob Lanier was fired. Fisher went on to become Mid-American Conference player of the year in his junior season at Kent State while McClinton became a two-time first-team all-A.C.C. player at Miami. Kojo Mensah played two years with the Saints before departing under bizarre circumstances. He resurfaced at Duquesne where he was a victim in a shooting incident and declared for the N.B.A. draft after his junior season. The only player from the class to finish his career at Siena was the 3-point specialist Tay Fisher who was a star in the 2008 M.A.A.C. tournament championship game and now plays with the Harlem Globetrotters.“It was a very talented class” Huerter said of the four guards “but I think they would have bumped into each other too much to ever really reach the full potential of a team. I think Kojo and Jack had to have the ball in their hands all the time to be successful. They were not guys who could play off the ball as well. Al Fisher was the same way. They all made plays with the ball. It would have been very difficult to find enough basketballs in that lineup. That class would definitely be a big step below. I think talent-wise individually they were very good but collectively they would never have the success.”The Class of 1989 was another highly-skilled group that suffered significant losses. Dwight Walton played just one season before he was lost due to eligibility issues and the high-scoring guard Rick Williams was dismissed from the team after three seasons. Even so Siena’s career blocks leader Monty Henderson and the 1000-point scorer and rebounder extraordinaire Steve McCoy did play four full years capping them off with the 1989 N.C.A.A. tournament appearance.“Those players had great potential” said Huerter who played with all but Walton. “They had some combinations. They didn’t bump into each other as much at the same position. All four of those guys could have played at the same time — add a Marc Brown as a point guard — that team wins a lot of games and would rival the victories that this senior class has and my senior class had. It’s just unfortunately Rick’s career was cut short and Dwight’s career was cut short.”Because of an editing era an earlier version referred to Siena as a university instead of a college.
9,Edward F. Kook the founder and longtime president of the Century Lighting Company which brightened more than 1000 Broadway plays died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. His death at the age of 87 was caused by a heart attack a family spokesman said.Mr. Kook (pronounced cook) was a major behind-the-scenes theater figure for 40 years. He received a 1952 Tony award and the 1962 Kelcey Allen Award for long and devoted service to the theater. He founded and managed Century Lighting in Manhattan from 1929 to 1968 personally supervising the design manufacture and popularization of many innovations in lighting instruments effects and controls in theaters opera houses and television studios in the United States Canada Europe and South America. He sold the company in 1964 to the Progress Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia which renamed it the Lighting Corporation of America but he stayed on to aid the transition.George C. Izenouer a leading inventor of lighting systems worked closely with Mr. Kook for 44 years in developing increasingly sophisticated devices. He said yesterday from his home in Connecticut ''I was the inventor and engineer and he was the entrepreneur who made it all possible.''Hours Cut to SecondsA major breakthrough was their installation of the first electronic lighting control system in a professional theater in New York at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center in the mid-1960's. With the system hours of rehearsal time formerly required for recording a given lighting cut were reduced to seconds.
0,To the Editor:Re ''Play Nicely Everyone. In Nassau It's the Law'' (news article Sept. 25):It is a shame that we have to institute laws to uphold sportsmanship and set up legislation to control what parents and coaches should be able to handle in their own backyard.As someone who has been an athletic director for several sports I can honestly tell you that the worst part of the position is dealing with some parents. Their attitude is terrible and they treat even their grammar-school-age children as if they are playing for the major leagues. Your article is right on target as far as parental behavior goes because I have seen it.Perhaps the parents should remember that they are not supposed to be living vicariously through their children.BART BAKERUnion N.J.

7,Peace Day UrgedThe Pontiff recalled that he had urged world leaders three years ago to join in the church celebration of Jan. 1 as an an nual peace day. Pope Paul did not mention the Vatican's ad herence to the international treaty. A Vatican comment is sued with the official statement described the treaty as a “con dition for general disarma ment.”The Vatican disclosed that it had consulted various govern ments on the matter and that it would set a date for the signing ceremony in agreement with the three Governments that are sponsors of the treaty. They are the United States Britain and the Soviet Union. This was taken to mean that formal diplomatic exchanges would take place also between the Papacy and the Soviet Gov ernment. Although the Vatican and the Kremlin have no offi cial ties informal contacts have occurred lately. Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko paid a call on Pope Paul in November.The treaty of 1968 on halting the spread of nuclear Weapons was ratified by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1969 and came into force on March 5 1970. The Vatican as a sovereign state has become a signatory of several interna tional treaties and agreements in the past.At noon today the Pontiff praised the commutation of the death sentences recently im posed by courts in Burgas and Leningrad as contributions to world peace.Praises DecisionsAddressing a crowd in St. Peter's Square from a window of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace the Pontiff said: “We are starting the new year by the grace of God with the comforting thought of the two acts of clemency that have con cluded two senational trials.”

1,The ministry runs the program. But the law that set it up requires participants to join and help finance a nonprofit AdvantageBC established in 1986 to promote British Columbia as a business destination. AdvantageBC advises its members on how to benefit from the tax breaks. The involvement of this group has also become a target for critics.“There is no reason for this organization to be outside of government” said Duff Conacher a founder of Democracy Watch a Canadian civic organization “except to escape the ethics transparency and accountability requirements government institutions have to face.”Colin Hansen a former provincial finance minister who helped expand the program’s tax incentives in 2010 is president and chief executive of AdvantageBC. He defended the group’s involvement in the tax-break program. “On all issues we are fully accountable to our members which is where that accountability should be” he said in an email.As finance minister Mr. Hansen repeatedly declared that expanding the program would help attract companies doing international business and “create those jobs in British Columbia.”In a recent interview though he said that its goal was really to enlarge the local financial services sector. “The program was not actually set up to be a job creator” he said.Mr. Hansen said most of the companies listed as “core members” on the group’s website were registered in the program. But he also said that some companies joined the group before seeking the benefits. He declined to provide a complete list of businesses. “Some companies are a little more sensitive about being included” he said.It is unclear which businesses listed on AdvantageBC’s website are in the program and receiving tax breaks. But a company must be a core member to get the refunds.
1,Curating a selection of the original interview recordings (whose sound quality is damn near pristine) Mr. Jones fashions an unfaltering encomium that’s entirely free of the highfalutin monologues that might deter noncinephiles. Bob Balaban’s intermittent narration is soft and unintrusive and a chorus of lauded directors mostly American and all male (I can’t help thinking that a woman might have dug deeper into the significant contributions of Hitchcock’s wife and collaborator Alma Reville) chime in with acuity and ardor.What they don’t do is show how their own movies might have been influenced by Hitchcock’s technique which Mr. Jones lovingly illustrates in dissections of a few of the master’s most memorable scenes. Though merely a tasting menu these moments add jolts of pulpy fun and allow their creator to speak for himself. The man who embraced many of the characteristics that movie snobs love to denigrate — his genre; his prolific output (at the time of the interview he was just completing his 48th film); the constraints of the studio system — is finally his own best argument for the happy coexistence of art and entertainment.“Hitchcock/Truffaut” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Have you seen ‘Psycho’? Running time: 1 hour 20 minutes.

0,''I miss my neighbors. I feel blessed and fortunate that my house was saved but this place was more than houses and yards -- it was a community.''BONNIE CHASE whose house survived a fire that destroyed 43 of 47 houses in her neighborhood north of Claremont Calif. [A1]
9,''We never had a discussion about 'Let's change your image George' '' Mr. Rubinstein said. ''The discussion centered on 'What's the best thing to do as I build a good team.' Last year George told me he wanted to build the best team he could for New York and for Yankee fans and to let that do the talking for the team.''He's aware of all the bad publicity and this was his decision to build the club and let people write about the club. It's been on purpose that he's given very very few interviews. He came up with the solution he stayed the course and it was hard. During this whole year he wasn't boastful he wasn't hateful. It was an interesting effort on his part.''Not everyone thinks that the Yankee owner has changed his stripes. ''Sports fans have the feeling that the Yankees win in spite of him'' said Chris Russo the co-host of ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' a popular sports call-in radio show on WFAN-AM. ''Most realize he's a pain in the neck.'' But even Mr. Russo who is emphatically not a Steinbrenner fan acknowledges a seeming change in the volatile facade.''Last year he really ticked people off'' Mr. Russo said ''so I'm not going to give him a break just because he's had a good 11 months.''But not only do some fans feel he has a lot of making up to do there's also a feeling that Mr. Steinbrenner is making nice to New Yorkers before announcing that he will move the team from the Bronx to Manhattan or even New Jersey.''He just wants to get a nice reputation before he makes the big move'' said Frank Myers 19 who was outside Yankee Stadium yesterday afternoon. ''With a guy like him it always comes down to money. If he moves the stadium to a richer neighborhood he'll make more money.''Mr. Steinbrenner 66 broke his silence briefly yesterday and spoke to a reporter on the subject of his image. He said his demeanor this season had nothing at all to do with the issue of whether he will move the team. He declined to address the question of whether he would move. As for his treatment of Mr. Showalter he said ''I will not say one bad thing about Buck Showalter but I don't think I have to apologize for what happened.''

8,A jury decided today that British commandos acted within the law when they shot and killed three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas in this British colony last March.Critics of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government have said the killings were part of an unofficial ''shoot to kill'' policy against members of the I.R.A. But the 11-member jury ruled that the commandos of the Special Air Service acted lawfully when they killed Daniel McCann Sean Savage and Mairead Farrell on March 6 as the three walked toward the Spanish border. The jury's vote was 9 to 2.After the verdict Nyall Farrell the brother of Miss Farrell said: ''This is a Pyrrhic victory for the Crown Counsel. There was a split decision.'' Michael Hucker lawyer for the soliers called the ruling ''total vindication.'' Fear of Car BombThe commandos testified at the inquest that they believed that the three I.R.A. members were prepared to detonate a car bomb by remote control and that the three made threatening moves when confronted. The I.R.A. has acknowledged that the three were on ''active service'' meaning they were on a mission to strike against a British target at the time of their deaths.

9,On March 31 before settling in for a game charades Senator Edward M. Kennedy called an old friend a Miami lawyer named Marvin Rosen to wish him a happy Passover. The next day Mr. Kennedy called Mr. Rosen again and not for holiday pleasantries. It was to find a defense lawyer for William K. Smith his suddenly notorious nephew.Thus began the deluge. The charge of rape against Mr. Smith has provided employment opportunities for it seems every trial lawyer from here to Lake Okeechobee and a few beyond. Nearly everybody connected to the case however remotely has hired representation.Here is a scorecard with absolutely no guarantee that it is complete:Mr. Rosen recommended Mark Schnapp his partner who immediately went to work on Mr. Smith's defense with two Washington lawyers Herbert Miller and Randall Turk.Apparently unhappy with the Washingtonians the Kennedys sought someone closer by. Joined by a lawyer for the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation Brian Dunn Mr. Smith met with Neal Sonnett and James Jay Hogan of Miami before hiring Roy Black a dapper and down-to-earth man known locally as the Professor.

1,Early in Lydia Peelle’s first novel “The Midnight Cool” she surveys the teeming crowd of men and animals at a horse and mule auction and writes: “Skinny dogs trotted through it all like they had someplace to be crescents of hoof trimmings from the blacksmith held like cigarettes between their teeth.”The people in Ms. Peelle’s fiction are fully imagined but we’ll get to them. It’s animals that give her work its heartbeat. The first story in her 2009 debut “Reasons for and Advantages of Breathing” — as assured and rewarding a collection as you’ll find — was titled “Mule Killers” referring to the tractors that put these beasts of burden out of the agriculture business. The narrator’s father a farmer especially loves a now-unnecessary mule named Orphan Lad with his “sharp shoulders and soft ears the mealy tuck of his lower lip.”The majority of the action in Ms. Peelle’s novel takes place in 1916 and 1917 in the months leading up to America’s entry into World War I and mules are center stage. The book is even dedicated to them. Billy a middle-age horse trader and his young partner and charge Charles turn their attention to the British Army’s — and eventually the American Army’s — demand for strong mules overseas. They’re not above cutting corners but they operate in a patriotic atmosphere in which people remind one another: “Don’t just do your bit but do your all.”Billy is injured by a bad-tempered dangerous horse sold to the pair under false pretenses by Leland Hatcher the richest man in a Tennessee town. Charles falls profoundly in love with Leland’s spirited daughter Catherine. The book revolves around three dramas all of which unfold at a leisurely pace: Charles’s potential consummation with Catherine; the men’s ability to navigate their mule business to an honest profit; and flashbacks to the late 1800s for Billy’s back story including the explanation of his close relationship with Charles.

0,Benjamin DeMott a prominent writer scholar and cultural critic whose work explored the mythology that underpins contemporary American life especially collective ideas about race class and sex died on Thursday at his home in Worthington Mass. He was 81 and also had a home in Anna Maria Fla.The cause was cardiac arrest his son Tom said.At his death Mr. DeMott was emeritus professor of English at Amherst College where he had taught for nearly 40 years. Before retiring from the college in 1990 he was the Mellon professor of humanities there.The author of more than a dozen books Mr. DeMott was best known for a trilogy that examined cultural beliefs in three sensitive areas: "The Imperial Middle: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Class" (William Morrow & Company 1990); "The Trouble With Friendship: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Race" (Atlantic Monthly Press 1995); and "Killer Woman Blues: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Gender and Power" (Houghton Mifflin 2000).The books investigated what Mr. DeMott saw as three pervasive social myths: the assumption held by many Americans that we live in a classless society; the promise held out by movies and television that individual friendships between blacks and whites can vanquish racism all by themselves; and the images of women ubiquitous in popular culture that render them almost indistinguishable from men.

0,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this two-part lesson students first examine the United States electoral college system and understand it as it applies to the 2004 presidential election. They then learn about the twelve battleground states in this year’s election and predict election results.Author(s):Annissa Hambouz The New York Times Learning NetworkYasmin Chin Eisenhauer The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: Two one-hour class periodsObjectives:Students will:1. Express their understanding of the United States electoral process including the electoral college.2. Learn about the battleground states in the 2004 presidential election and the significance of their electoral votes by reading and discussing the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line.”3. Develop an informative pamphlet on the history function and controversy of the electoral college system.4. Investigate the political traditions history and potential impact of each of the twelve battleground states in the 2004 election by reading and discussing state-specific articles from The New York Times.5. Make election predictions for the battleground states as well as a general prediction for the election based on their battleground state predictions; compare predictions to the final election results.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils-paper-student journals-copies of the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041101monday.html (one per student)-resources on American electoral politics such as civics or government textbooks and encyclopedias-computers with Internet access-copies of each of the following articles (enough of each for 1/6 of the students):ArkansasColoradoFloridaIowaMichiganMinnesotaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoOhioPennsylvaniaWisconsinActivities / Procedures:DAY ONE: UNDERSTANDING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt written on the board prior to class: “How are the President and Vice President of the United States elected? Jot down everything that you know about the process.” Allow students a few minutes to write and then have them share their responses briefly with the class. Depending on the level of the class students’ responses may range in understanding from popular votes to explaining the electoral college system. If students are unfamiliar with the electoral college be sure to define it. Discuss the following as a class: What do students know about the relationship between popular votes and electoral votes? How did this topic come up in the 2000 presidential election? What might be some of the benefits of the electoral college? Why might some perceive it as unfair? What is a battleground (or swing) state and how are they related to the electoral college and the candidates’ campaigns?2. As a class read and discuss the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line” (found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041101monday.html) using the following questions:a. How many states does the article refer to as “hard-fought”? What does this mean?b. What have the candidates done to campaign in these pivotal states?c. How many electoral votes are needed for a presidential candidate to win the election?d. How many electoral votes does each of the battleground states mentioned in the article have?e. Why might Ohio be considered a particularly important battleground state according to the article?f. What might pose a threat to John Kerry’s candidacy in Minnesota according to the article?g. How might the 2004 election prove to be more of a legal controversy than the 2000 election according to the article?3. Explain to students they will be working in groups to create parts of a class-wide pamphlet about the United States presidential and vice presidential electoral process to inform students their age who might not be familiar with the electoral college system. Divide the class into four groups and assign each one of the following topics to cover in the pamphlet (written on the board or copied on a handout for easier student access):GROUP ONE: HOW THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WORKS This group explains the difference between popular votes and electoral votes how electors are allotted to each state how electors are appointed and how and when electors cast their votes.GROUP TWO: HISTORY OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group examines the electoral college’s origins how the electoral process differs from the Constitutional Convention’s 1787 plan; Article II Section I of the Constitution; the 12th and 23rd Amendments to the Constitution; and disputed elections throughout history.GROUP THREE: THE DEBATE OVER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group addresses the controversy of the “winner take all” system arguments to abolish the college as well as arguments to defend the system.GROUP FOUR: THE FUTURE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group investigates proposals to reform the electoral college including direct elections proportional representation and the “national bonus plan” and the likelihood for abolition of or alteration to the system in the future.Using all available classroom resources groups research their pamphlet topics. Students should be sure to make note of the bibliographical information of the sources they use. Once groups have completed their research each group should type its section of the pamphlet in a predetermined font and font size. Each group’s section should take up approximately one column of a tri-fold pamphlet. Create the class pamphlet by folding a paper into thirds. The front of the pamphlet may be designed by a student. The next four columns should include the four groups’ works. The final column should provide bibliographical information. Completed pamphlets should be copied and distributed in a future class. (They may also be made available to other students.)4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Each student should view The New York Times 2004 Election Guide Interactive Graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/) which allows one to view a voter map of the United States geographically by number of electoral votes and by battleground status. (If home Internet access is not available the maps may be printed out and distributed to students). Using the information from the maps each student creates a chart listing the states deemed battleground states in the left column with the other columns detailing the number of electoral votes each state receives its current status as leaning toward one of the bipartisan candidates or as an unclear or swing state and the party for which state voted in the 2000 election. Then each student should write a journal entry analyzing how the information on these maps might be used to predict the outcome of the election.DAY TWO: BATTLEGROUND STATES AND PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class create the chart assigned for homework on the board and fill in only the names of the twelve battleground states (Arkansas Colorado Florida Iowa Michigan Minnesota Nevada New Hampshire New Mexico Ohio Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Leave the columns under the headings “Number of Electoral Votes” “Current Status” and “Party Voted for in 2000 Election” blank. When students enter class assign each a blank to fill in on the chart using the data they compiled for homework. Once the classroom board chart is complete have students compare it to their homework charts for discrepancies and then discuss their responses to the homework journal assignement.2. Divide class into six groups and assign each group two battleground states and their corresponding New York Times articles:ArkansasColoradoFloridaIowaMichiganMinnesotaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoOhioPennsylvaniaWisconsinEach group should read and discuss each of its two articles aloud and answer the following questions after reading each article (written on the board for easier student access):-What makes this a “battleground state” in the 2004 election?-What is this state’s particular political history or tradition?-What information provided in this article might provide a clue to which candidate might receive this state’s electoral votes?-Based on the predictors in the article how do you think this state will vote on November 2 2004?After groups have read their assigned articles and answered the questions on each state the class should reconvene to fill in a final column added onto the battleground states chart on the board titled “Prediction.” Each group should provide their prediction with a brief explanation. Based on the groups’ predictions for the twelve battleground states and the Interactive Graphic maps’ predictions for the other 38 states whom does the class predict will be the winner of the November 2 2004 election?3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students should follow the televised election coverage and evaluate whether the predictions for their assigned battleground states were accurate. In their journals students should analyze why their predictions were right or wrong as well as their reactions to the election results.Further Questions for Discussion:-In your opinion should the electoral college system be preserved abolished or changed? Why?-How did the 2000 election change the way Americans view the electoral system?-Do you think the Osama bin Laden tape mentioned in the article will have an impact on the election? If so how? If not why not?-Why do you think so many of the so-called “swing” states are in the Midwest?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on journal responses contributions to the class electoral college pamphlet participation in group discussions well-informed battleground state and election predictions and thoughtful response to the outcome of the 2004 election.Vocabulary:intensity tinglingly deployed stump furor trending conservatism wooing troika third-party hairbreadth treacherousExtension Activities:1. In the 2004 Election Guide interactive graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/) The New York Times addresses the “Nader Factor” or those states where Independent and Reform parties candidate Ralph Nader has been included on or blocked from the ballot. Research the controversy and litigation around Mr. Nader’s candidacy and write an article for your school’s newspaper about his role in the race for the White House.2. On November 6 2001 U.S. Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) introduced three new pieces of electoral reform legislation to the House of Representatives. Investigate these bills and create a chart tracing the progress of each from its introduction to the present time. Then offer your opinion about each of these bills.3. With terms such as “battleground” and “the ground war” as examples from the American political vocabulary brainstorm as many war metaphors as you can. Compile the list into glossary of war metaphors (which can be expanded upon using different themes such as sports or nature) with definitions and examples of usage for each.4. Using the 2000 election as an example create mock television news coverage for the other instances in United States history in which the electoral college votes differed from the popular votes. Had television existed in those times what issues or controversies surrounding the elections of 1824 1876 and 1888 would have made the news?5. During election week read The New York Times every day and analyze its balance of coverage of the candidates. Alternately create a headline timeline of articles related to a specific theme such as a specific candidate candidates’ views of one another key issues voting trends or personal reactions to the election. (To order The New York Times for your classroom click here.)Interdisciplinary Connections:Economics- How much did each candidate in the 2004 election spend on his campaign? Research and chart the campaign finances of the bipartisan and third party candidates.Global Studies- Research the electoral systems of Australia Great Britain and Canada. Explain and compare each to the United States electoral college in a creative presentation to your class.Mathematics- The article read in class mentions the “limitless ways” the two main candidates could reach the “magic number” of 270 electoral votes. Based on the research conducted in class create ten different mathematical combinations that would result in victory for each candidate.Other Information on the Web:The Learning Network’s Election 2004 special feature (//www.nytimes.com/learning/election2004) explores issues at the forefront of this year’s election through lesson plans and Times articles as well as provides other resources for your classroom.The New York Times Election 2004 section (//www.nytimes.com/pages/politics/campaign/) offers a collection of articles and interactive features on this year’s presidential election.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Civics Standard 20 – Understands the roles of political parties campaigns elections and associations and groups in American politics.

9,''One minute it was nothing and the next minute it was smoke everywhere'' he said. ''When it got real crazy in there I had to let the guitar go. You couldn't see anything. I tripped over somebody. The young lady I was with fell and she kind of pulled me down. When you hit the floor you could breathe. I got up and followed the wall and I got to the cigarette machine and it was right near the door and I heard people saying 'This way out' which was really cool.''Mrs. Acosta was near the bandstand when the announcement was made and by the time she reached the staircase it was treacherously crowded. ''You could not see your hand in front of your face'' she said.Almost everyone ignored the five other exit doors and headed out the way they had come in.In the parking lot outside firefighters were arriving as survivors madly scanned the crowd or tried to make their way back inside to find friends. Mr. Henderson looked around for his fellow musicians and found all but two. One was Mr. Chase who had been his classmate at Benjamin Franklin High School in Manhattan and had lingered at the microphone to guide people to safety. The other was the keyboard player Damon De Feis 19 whom he had last seen covering up the organ he had been playing.''We kind of knew'' said Mr. Henderson who is still a musician. ''But you don't want to believe. We just kept waiting and finally we went home.''Mrs. Acosta coughing from the smoke sat with her date at a distance and gazed in disbelief at the frantic activity in the flaming shopping center. Mrs. Cassone's group got into her Volkswagen and went home. Sometime later her brother Robert a volunteer firefighter arrived at the scene of the fire. Seeing a red Volkswagen parked in the lot he assumed his sister was inside.''They wouldn't let him go in'' Mrs. Cassone recalled. ''So they made somebody drive him home to see if I was home.''Firefighters -- in the technology of the day only a handful were equipped with breathing apparatus -- formed a chain and blindly feeling their way pulled out more than 100 unconscious or dazed people but had to stop because of the intense heat. When the fire was finally doused they saw a sodden blackened jungle of twisted electric cables charred bar stools and air-conditioning units that had caved through the roof. They found 24 bodies killed by the smoke but so badly burned they had to be identified through dental X-rays.

1,HERXHEIM AM BERG Germany — After she found out there was a swastika on the church bell Sigrid Peters refused to continue playing the organ during services.Shielded from public view high up a rickety wooden staircase inside the yellow church tower the bell is still suspended where it was first hung in 1934 by an enthusiastic Nazi mayor in Herxheim am Berg a hilltop village of 750 people in Germany’s southwestern wine country.It is smaller than the two other bells flanking it and is covered in pigeon droppings. But the swastika is clearly discernible and so is the inscription: “Everything for the Fatherland — Adolf Hitler.”“People have been getting married under the swastika and they didn’t even know it” Ms. Peters said.

8,Who ordained that the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge which spans the entrance to New York Harbor should be toll-free eastbound? No less authority than the Congress of the United States that's who.This Federal intrusion on city traffic management grew out of a local squabble.The bridge links Staten Island and Brooklyn and carries through traffic between Long Island and New Jersey and points west. The toll gates are all on Staten Island and the backup of waiting cars fouled the air. Staten Islanders therefore petitioned for free passage eastbound and double tolls for the westbound return.Local and state authorities refused. The one-way toll on the bridge would make possible a cheap round trip for drivers who cross into Brooklyn on the bridge and then return via Manhattan and the Holland Tunnel which is free westbound. That would reduce revenues for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority - and create perpetual gridlock in lower Manhattan.The Staten Islanders then took their proposal to their Representative Guy Molinari who pushed it through Congress with the help of his fellow Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato.
0,OF all the seasons autumn can be the most fickle. With the arrival of in-between weather -- warmer than winter but spiked with rain and frigid breezes -- an insulated vest comes in handy particularly for those who prefer to exercise outside.Thanks to innovations in fabrics and design today's outdoor vests are light sleek and practical.Here are five that run the gamut from ultralightweight to bulky.Keep in mind a heavier vest is not necessarily a warmer one. Base your choice on what kind of exercise you'll do while wearing it. CHRISTIAN DeBENEDETTICloudveil Inversion $135 www.cloudveil.com (available online in mid-September). This vest's exterior is tough water-repellent nylon making it a sound choice for skiers and casual hikers alike. Inside is pillowy 650-fill down enough to keep a person warm in a cold wind. Yet at only 10 ounces the vest is light and it can be stuffed into a grapefruit-size sack (included).

8,To the Editor:Reports on the glut of American physicians as in your July 15-16 series on medicine and hospitals fail to consider a relevant alternative.Many developing countries have an appalling deficit of medical personnel.While in the United States as of 1980 we had one physician for each 550 people in stark contrast Haiti had one physician for each 5990 people; Bangladesh one for each 13860; Nepal one for each 30780; Chad one for each 49070 and Ethiopia one for each 69600.Graduating U.S. physicians should be urged if not required to spend a period working in Latin America Africa or Asia so that the basic human right of universal health care might be realized.

1,The president of Russia Vladimir V. Putin articulated a possible legal strategy on Wednesday for scores of Russian athletes preparing to defend themselves in sports doping prosecutions: casting doubt on the chain of custody for their urine samples.“When we provided the test samples there were no complaints” Mr. Putin said going on to describe the microscopic scratches on glass sample bottles that investigators said showed that Russia’s Federal Security Service had cracked into them to switch out the athletes’ incriminating urine.“If there was a problem with scratches of whatever kind this should have been noted in the relevant reports but there was nothing of this sort. In other words these samples were stored somewhere and we cannot be held responsible for the storage conditions” he said.The scores of glass bottles in question from the 2014 Sochi Olympics — bottles thought to be tamper-proof before last year’s scandal — have been stored by the International Olympic Committee in a secure lab in Switzerland for the last three years.
8,''If Mr. Biron had agreed to stay I certainly wouldn't have an interest in joining management'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''But with Ed deciding to leave I made a judgment that I would rather have the title for myself.''Comfed which operates in Massachusetts and Connecticut has been hurt by a weakening mortgage market in New England and Mr. O'Malley said he was concerned about the value of his investment. But he added that the Comfed had a ''decent franchise and should become a reasonable earner.''After graduation from Manhattan College Mr. O'Malley got his start in the mail room of Philipp Brothers a commodities trading company. He soon moved into trading and dealt with ''just about every commodity the company handled'' he said. He spent 10 years in Europe and then took over and successfully ran the company's energy business ''which formed the basis for my rise through the executive ranks'' he said.In 1981 Philipp Brothers by then known as Phibro merged with Salomon Inc. the investment banking house. Mr. O'Malley left Salomon at the end of 1986 and set up the investment business Argus Investments Inc. in Stamford Conn.Argus holds a 24 percent interest in the Tosco Corporaiton a large independent refiner on the West Coast. The group then bought the luxury skyboxes at Giants Stadium and leases them out. ''We then got the Denver boxes and we are negotiating for other ones'' Mr. O'Malley said.

And though the company has catered to decorators and architects its advertising has stimulated so many calls from homeowners that it decided to open the doors a bit wider said Christopher Peacock the president of Paris Ceramics USA. A 1300-square-foot retail showroom is scheduled to open on Oct. 1 at the A & D Building 150 East 58th Street in Manhattan.

7,Ailey and Ellington could start any party off at a high level and with “Night Creature” they opened the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater season last night in a shower of good feelings. The City Center 551.11 Street Theater had a festive .atmosphere that permeated the whole program. There were lots of things to celebrate and the company showed its best performing manners.It took Alvin Ailey 20 years to decide to choreograph ‘Night Creature” which was composed in 1955. But the result was the product of care and concern. It was one of the important steps that paved the way for the Duke Ellington Festival that celebrated the composer's talent during the bicentenial year. Mr. Ailey has selected several of Ellington's scores to work with over the years but showed a marked rapport with this one.•The voluptuous woman who led the company on the serpentine chase was Sarita Allen twisting and turning from one admirer to another. Sociability became a predatory exercise as she first linked herself with Dudley Williams and passed him by for a dalliance with Melvin Jones. The switch back to Mr. Williams was carried out as easily as flicking off a switch. There was heartlessness in the dance but the energy covered up its casual toying with human affections. Everyone knew that it wasn't a kid's game though seemed like one at times.Sara Yarborough made it clear that she was home and happy in her first appearance with the company since her return. The occasion was the edgy duet with the logical but convoluted name “The Time Before The Time After (Arter The Time Before).” Prizes should be awarded for being able to say it correctly three times in succession or even just once.

9,Maybe it's a first but no matter. An 87-page book of photographs called "The Seasons Observed" (Harry N. Abrams $24.95) is to go on sale at cosmetics counters later this month as well as in bookstores. An exhibition of the photographs will open on Sept. 14 at the Holly Solomon Gallery in SoHo. The gallery will also sell the pictures.The photographs are the work of EVELYN H. LAUDER so there's no need to explain the cosmetics connection or the whys and wherefores. Mrs. Lauder the senior corporate vice president of Estee Lauder is donating her royalties to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and many department stores are following suit with from half to all of their profits.An originator of the pink-ribbon campaign to increase awareness of breast cancer Mrs. Lauder has already raised $18 million for a breast cancer center for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and for research into the disease.Not so incidentally Mrs. Lauder said the family company will soon introduce a new cosmetics color -- you guessed it -- "Pink Ribbon."

0,I just watched the end of the Twins/Tigers game on ESPN. The Tigers won 1-0. Marcus Thames hit a home run in the bottom of the eighth inning and Jeremy Bonderman got the win. He’s 9-1. (Gary Sheffield didn’t play.)Two thoughts crossed my mind. One is that if the Indians maintain their 98-win pace and capture the Central the Yankees won’t catch the Tigers for the wild card. The other is that the Tigers had to suffer a lot to be this good and the Yankees have not suffered for 15 years.When the Tigers dealt Jeff Weaver and his long-term contract to the Yankees in a three-way trade in 2002 they got back Bonderman who then was 19 years old from the Oakland A’s. They let him struggle in the majors for a while and he was there when the Tigers lost 119 games in 2003. Their prize for such futility was an ace Justin Verlander who was drafted with the No. 2 pick overall the next season.Then there’s Thames. He came up as a Yankee and was traded to Texas in ’03 for Ruben Sierra who was useful for a while. The Tigers wound up with Thames and they’re glad they have him now.The Yankees at 37-41 are going through growing pains. Clearly because of their payroll they’re built to win now. They have a dozen players under contract for $10 million or more this season. That’s the price of veterans with track records. And for years that was basically the only kind of player the Yankees would seek.They’d like to get younger but it’s hard. They have Chien-Ming Wang Melky Cabrera and Robinson Cano. They have Phil Hughes and a bunch of other live arms in the minors. But they have a real dearth of young position players.Maybe the next chance they have to trade for a pitcher they’ll look forward and take the Bonderman type instead of the Weaver type. Maybe they’ll hold onto the young productive and cheap position players like Thames and give him a real chance.The problem is they’re still the Yankees and they have a reputation to maintain a cable network to feed a new stadium coming the same year as the Mets’ new building and a rabid fan base that pays lots of money to watch a team that’s competitive both now and in the future.It’s a complicated vision GM Brian Cashman is trying to articulate and if he keeps his job it will be fascinating to see if he can pull it off. This year clearly it’s just not working.

0,Gateway Inc. in San Diego the computer maker said yesterday that it would take its account in-house a move that had been expected. Billings were estimated at $250 million.The shift came after the breakdown of talks to assign the account to the Minneapolis and New York offices of Fallon Worldwide part of the Publicis Groupe. Fallon was to replace McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising -- part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- which parted ways with Gateway in February after three years.The Gateway in-house team will work with Henry Corra a documentary filmmaker and his company Corra Films in New York; on several occasions Gateway bypassed its agency of record to work with Mr. Corra on television commercials.
9,Perhaps familiar surroundings and a towel-waving frenzied crowd at the Garden will help snap the Knicks out of their funk. But by losing Games 3 and 4 the Knicks have magnified the importance of Game 5. The winner will be one victory away from the finals. The loser will be one loss away from vacation."We respect the fact that we have the home court but we also respect the fact that there are no guarantees" said Pat Riley after a short practice session yesterday. "Home court will not guarantee anything. Players have to guarantee with a great effort. So that's what we're going to have to have."More baskets would not hurt the Knicks' cause either. No team not even the Chicago Bulls have made the Knicks' offense look as bad in the playoffs as the Pacers made it look in the third and fourth games. The Knicks were pathetic in Game 3 when they scored 68 points a record low for the National Basketball Association playoffs since the advent of the 24-second clock. They were merely terrible in Game 4 when they produced 77 points in an 83-77 loss. Right Kind of PlayersWhy has Indiana been able to shut down the Knicks so thoroughly? The Pacers have a superb game plan and the players to execute it. They have have a tall physical front line that matches up well with New York's frontcourt. Rik Smits has a 4-inch height advantage over Patrick Ewing enabling him to alter Ewing's shot more often than most centers. Smits's backup Antonio Davis has the strength to push Ewing away from his favorite low-post spots.Dale Davis Antonio Davis and Smits have kept Charles Oakley Anthony Mason and Ewing from dominating the glass. And Derrick McKey's defense has helped keep Charles Smith from reaching double figures in any game yet. To win the Knicks simply must have more scoring from their small forward whether he be Smith or Mason. And when fast-break opportunities arise the Knicks must react quickly.

0,“So the B.C.S. seems to be damned if it does and damned if it doesn’t a neat trick even for such a fundamentally flawed institution” Dan Shanoff writes in this week’s Play Newsletter.Shanoff continues:Personally I would like to see Mr. Slive take his ball and go home: “SEC-ede” from the B.C.S. and create his own playoff; as the nation’s strongest conference (by far — it boasts the past two national champs) he has the juice to do it.Invite more playoff-friendly conferences even individual teams into the mix (and don’t be afraid to go it alone). Create room for the non-B.C.S. schools to participate. Generate billions in revenue from TV networks and advertisers. And isolate the Big Ten and Pac-10 daring them to try to proclaim one of their member schools — even an undefeated one — as “national champ” while the rest of the country has turned its attention to a thrilling 8- or 16-team playoff. Any school that doesn’t want to participate doesn’t have to; I imagine that resistance will be short-lived.Incremental measures won’t work. Obstructionist colleagues need to be marginalized.To save the B.C.S. they need to destroy it.
1,BerlinI suppose should thank the Chambre Syndicale the organizing body for French fashion for creating a break between the men’s shows and haute couture. It gave me a good excuse to go to Berlin.I’ve made three trips to the city in the last half dozen years and each time I try to grasp more see more. I am always on foot or on a bicycle. Yesterday’s walk was around Kreuzberg and then to Potsdamer Platz. Today I hoofed it to the Neues Museum and then around Mitte and finally at close to 6 p.m. an Elizabeth Peyton show in a beautiful broken-down ballroom. A friend of mine from Austin Tex. an artist named Ali Fitzgerald joined me. Ali has been living and working in Berlin for the last 18 months so I was glad to have her perspective.This isn’t really a fashion trip. In fact one of the reasons I like Berlin is that you don’t feel the impulse to dress up or shop which is certainly not how you feel in Paris or London. Berlin feels a little lazy and casual — it’s eating Turkish food on a sidewalk terrace in Kreuzberg and stopping for a beer later. The sense of history here is also extraordinary so profound and immediate.We were up for some bookstores so Ali suggested a place she knew in Mitte. Yet when we arrived at 152 Brunnenstrasse the shop had a new name since her last visit. Hannes Wanderer opened 25 Books specializing in photography at that address a little more than a year ago. Right away I loved the plainness of the store — the books he liked on a table more on some shelves and another group of books and photo journals at the back. He was very informative; talkative too. We must have chatted for an hour. He has a Web site (25books.de) and he explained that the name doesn’t mean anything special. He just liked the way it sounded. He also publishes books under the imprint Peperoni Books.I bought two books: “Wunden” a self-published collection of photographs by a young German named Gerald von Foris which is an interesting assemblage of architecture animals and nature; and a book of images of West Berlin by Hans W. Mende. Between the fall of 1978 and the spring of 1979 Mr. Mende took pictures in areas along the Berlin Wall. Potsdamer Platz was still largely open land then and there were still damaged buildings — and it was only 30 years ago. That’s when Hannes Wanderer arrived in Berlin. “It was as it was becoming history” he said.

1,“One franc” Mr. Aznavour said. “After that I was able to tell my friends I was better paid than Piaf.”In 1958 the French government lifted a longstanding ban on allowing some of Mr. Aznavour’s more explicit songs — like “Après l’Amour” which recounts the aftermath of an episode of lovemaking — on the radio. “I was the first to write about social issues like homosexuality” Mr. Aznavour told The Times in 2006 referring to his 1972 song “What Makes a Man?” “I find real subjects and translate them into song.”He returned to New York in 1963 and rented Carnegie Hall where he performed to a packed house. (Among those in the audience was Bob Dylan who later said it was one of the greatest live performances he had ever witnessed.) A triumphant world tour followed.Thereafter the United States became a second home. Mr. Aznavour performed all over the country often with Liza Minnelli. He became a fixture in Las Vegas for a time and there married Ulla Thorsell a former model in 1967. She was his third wife.Mr. Aznavour had six children. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.As a child Mr. Aznavour watched his father go broke feeding penniless Armenian refugees in his restaurant. As his fame grew he became a spokesman and fund-raiser for the Armenian cause. He organized help worldwide after an earthquake killed 45000 people in Armenia in 1988. And when the country broke away from the crumbling Soviet Union in 1991 it made him an unofficial ambassador. He displayed the Corps Diplomatique plaque on his car as proudly as he wore the French Legion of Honor ribbon in his lapel.
0,''The Sorbonne should be razed and Chris Marker put up in its place'' the poet Henri Michaux is reported to have said a remark that seems almost reasonable in light of ''A Grin Without a Cat'' a fascinating 1977 documentary by Mr. Marker that opens today in a restored and updated version at the Film Forum in the South Village.Born Christian-François Bouche-Villeneuve in an upper-class suburb of Paris Mr. Marker who will turn 82 this year has been credited with inventing the ''essay film'' a form pitched between documentary and personal reflection. The documentary side of his work is reflected in his interest in history and specifically in the history of revolutionary movements: ''A Grin Without a Cat'' tells the story of the New Left from the movement's birth as a byproduct of the Vietnam War to the ouster of Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973.The personal philosophical side of Mr. Marker's work is reflected in his exploration of memory a subject he treated as science fiction in the 1962 film that remains his most famous creation ''La Jetée'' (remade by Terry Gilliam as ''12 Monkeys'' in 1995). For Mr. Marker truth is always a matter of an individual's point of view: history does not exist apart from our experience and interpretation of it.Divided into two 90-minute parts ''A Grin Without a Cat'' (the French title is an untranslatable slogan from May 1968 ''Le Fond de l'Air Est Rouge'') combines anonymous newsreels going back to the Russian Revolution with original material filmed by Mr. Marker in Cuba Czechoslovakia Washington and elsewhere. Part 1 subtitled ''Fragile Hands'' traces the growth of the student antiwar movement into the revolutionary surge that nearly toppled the government of Charles de Gaulle in 1968; Part 2 ''Severed Hands'' moves from the Russian repression of the Prague Spring to the coup d'état in Chile.

7,WASHINGTON Dec. 2 — Attorney General Griffin 13. Bell said today that he had ordered an investigation to determine whether any employee of the Dep4rtment of Justice had attempted to improperly influence the.appointment of the Wilted States Attorney in Pittsburgh.The Attorney General announced the inlernal inquiry at a hastily called news conference in which he criticized an article: in today's issue of The New York Times that quoted unidentified sources in the Justice Department as saying that Belt and Associate Attorney General Mfchael J. Egan ‘had improperly delayed a full‐scale investigation into payments to one candidate for the job.According to The Times account Mr. Bell responding to pressure from investigators in his ‘own department delayed planned appointment of George E. Schumacher as United States Attorney. in Pittsburgh pending an inquiry into $60000 in payments made to a Pennsylvania Congressman by. Mr. Schumacher's law firm. The Congressman Representative Joseph M. Gaydos is one of six = Democratic Representatives from western Pennsylvania who recommended Mr. Schumacher for the position.Federal officials have said that. under repeated questioning in the last four months Mr. Schumacher and Mr. Gaydos have given contradictory explanations for the payments which were made over four years beginning in the early 1970's. Mr. Bell said it was incorrect to say that he had delayed the appointment “under pressure from investigators in his own department” as the news article said. He also disagreed with the article's reference to the process as a “planned appointment” of Mr. Schumacher.

1,Mark Bittman on food and all things related.My father — who turned 89 this past Sunday bless him — grew up what’s now called “food insecure.” Like many immigrants the Bittman family ate whatever they could get their hands on. This served them well when dinner was a boiled potato with sour cream.It served them less well after World War II when every male in the family was making $60 a week or more which wasn’t bad when $60 paid the rent. Soon thereafter my paternal grandparents and their sons — my father had three brothers — were way overweight even obese. All developed diabetes and heart disease.[1]My father is the only survivor. Both those grandparents and two of my three uncles were dead by the time they were the (tender) age I am now.Of the two edges of the sword of America’s malnutrition — hunger and obesity — the latter is by far the more prevalent and deadly. In New York City perhaps 2 percent of children have “very low food security” which might mean vitamin deficiencies a day without food a loss of weight a month of being hungry[2]. Meanwhile 40 percent of New York’s public school students are overweight or obese and 2000 New Yorkers die each year from obesity or overweight-related conditions. All of those deaths are preventable.No one should belittle even a little hunger but this why-do-we-even-have-to-talk-about-it comparison of it and obesity is germane because the city’s Health Department recently suspended expansion of the Breakfast in the Classroom (BIC) program which serves free breakfast in the classrooms of 381 of 1750 public schools. The program is ostensibly meant to ensure that hungry kids start the day with something to eat.But the school system already offers every kid all 1.1 million of them regardless of income the opportunity to have free breakfast in the school cafeteria. BIC simply puts that breakfast on every kid’s desk.The Health Department reined in BIC after finding that roughly 20 percent of all kids might be eating two breakfasts: one before arriving at school and another at their desks adding on average about 90 unneeded calories to their daily intake. Linda Gibbs deputy mayor for Health and Human Services explained that the city wants to make “sure that that no child goes hungry and that every child has access to a healthy breakfast” but at the same time “wants to be cautious that our good intentions don’t inadvertently exacerbate the obesity issue” noting the 40 percent figure cited above.The move’s critics including some anti-hunger groups believe that measures to prevent obesity cannot be taken at the expense of addressing hunger and that it’s unconscionable not to act to prevent kids from going hungry.[3] (Ironically enough some research suggests that hunger may lead to obesity. That was my family’s story.)But at this point our moral aversion to hunger must be matched by our distress about kids eating themselves sick. Not only does obesity lead to increased rates of Type 2 diabetes but a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine also found that the heaviest kids were nearly twice as likely as the thinnest to die before age 55.Still: instead of arguing who needs help more — hungry kids or obese ones — we should help both starting by recognizing that combating poverty and fighting the dominance of the food “system” that promotes junk at the expense of real food are the ways to conquer both obesity and hunger.The ostensible rationale for BIC is not to provide free school breakfasts to food-insecure kids since such a program already exists but to reduce the stigma of going to claim breakfast in the cafeteria. There are indeed issues of making it to the cafeteria before the bell rings (what if the bus is late?) but if my memory serves me the stigma of being an overweight 8-year-old is at least as bad as having skipped breakfast at home and having to get it at school. [4]A serious program for healthy kids might offer occasional snacks of apples carrots and celery instead of boxed cereal or a cheese stick both common BIC options. Part of why that doesn’t happen is because perversely named “specialty crops” (you call them “fruits and vegetables”) aren’t supported by the Department of Agriculture in the same way as commodity crops like corn. [5]Fruits and vegetables should and could be overflowing in classrooms but that would benefit only kids. The people who really benefit from BIC are as usual the companies that market that food and that stand to increase their sales by billions of dollars if BIC were to become a national mandate.And though the work of anti-hunger organizations like Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) is essential some of their financing comes from the likes of ConAgra Kraft Tyson and the National Dairy Council. And it doesn’t take a cynic to imagine why Kraft or the Dairy Council might like to see kids starting the day with cereal or cheese. Nor is it difficult to imagine them influencing FRAC in the same way that Big Food’s lobbying and campaign contributions[6] might affect the farm bill. Similarly when the C.E.O. of Weight Watchers International is a co-author of an op-ed criticizing the city’s Health Department for making obesity a greater priority than hunger I can’t help thinking about just how much Weight Watchers would profit if yet another generation of Americans got fat. Shame on me I know.This is complicated and many of the critics of the Health Department’s actions are allies on other issues. But the vast majority of kids do not need more calories (simply put more calories to more kids means more obesity) and the real battles should be to subsidize healthy food discourage junk eradicate junk food advertising to children preserve and expand beneficial food assistance programs and have food policy determined by experts and citizens rather than by corporations and the elected officials who are in their pockets. At the same time let’s all — parents teachers administrators and concerned citizens — encourage those kids who need a free breakfast to make their way to the cafeteria where it awaits them.

7,Mr. Carter told the crowd that Mr. Humphrey had touched his family's life in “strange and delightful ways” and recalled his daughter Amy sitting in the Senator's lap dribbling moist brownie crumbs. He said he also remembered that when Mr. Humphrey learned that Lillian Carter the President's mother was serving in the Peace Corps in India the Senator arranged for her to be visited by the head of the Indian Peace Corps. “Who brought her very good fifth of bourbon” the President added.Before the dinner about 150 of the guests went to an early-evening reception at the Mondales’ official residence a big Victorian mansion in northwest Washington There near a crackling fireplace in a high‐ceiling parlor lined with modern art Luci Johnson Nugent daughter of former President Lyndon B. Johnson looked around at a crowd of familiar faces and said: “It's like old times.”Senator Humphrey was not among the reception guests but dominated the conversations of those who did attend. “It has been a dream of his for a long time to put that institute together” said Patrick O'Connor a Minnesota lawyer. Mr. Mondale on a receiving line with his wife Joan said he thought the Senator's appearance at the dinner would be difficult but rewarding. “I'll tell you what gives him the lift” the Vice President said. “He very much wants to make his papers available to students and scholars.”Asked earlier In the day if he had not been made uncomfortable by the continuing stream of tributes and testimonials the Senator said simply “This statement from the 23d Psalm expresses my view iully‐.My cup runneth over.”Forty states had proclaimed Dec. 2 as Hubert H. Humphrey Day and people from all 50 states filled the International Ballroom for the $1000-a-plate dinnerAlthough the Senator is recuperating from his latest series of chemotherapy treatments for inoperable cancer of the pelvis he nevertheless helped with organizing things.He had nothing to do with the menu of Cornish game hen and bananas flambe he said but the rest of the evening bore the imprint of his hand for he had consulted daily about plans.

9,''We're Gary Hart but we have money'' said Will Robinson Mr. Bradley's senior adviser who toiled in the campaigns of Walter F. Mondale in 1984 and Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. ''We're Gary Hart but we're putting together a structure and an organization and a full slate. We're Gary Hart but we know the rules.''The most concrete sign of the potency of the Bradley organization is that it has amassed nearly $12 million this year -- compared with almost $18 million for the Vice President -- and has spent its resources far more carefully. Mr. Gore has only about $2 million more than Mr. Bradley in the bank. That means that Mr. Bradley has the financial capacity to be competitive through at least the first round of contests.A convincing testament that Mr. Bradley is being taken seriously comes not from his campaign but from his opponent's. Steve Hildebrand Mr. Gore's Iowa director said his campaign was far better positioned yet he sounded almost envious as he reeled off names of his friends on the Bradley campaign including Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Mr. Robinson Iowa field director for Mr. Mondale in 1984.''Here's what I'm worried about: This is such a family fight and he's got all these smart people'' Mr. Hildebrand said. ''I know how good they are. I wish I had Will to call to talk about this. And Paul Wellstone wouldn't be a United States Senator if it weren't for caucus organizing. Paul gets it. He's on the phone all the time calling Iowans.''Still most Democrats involved in the process argue that the party's nomination is Mr. Gore's to lose. As an incumbent Vice President who has been plotting his campaign for years Mr. Gore enjoys numerous institutional advantages.Already Mr. Gore appears to have the support of most of the so-called superdelegates -- members of Congress party officials and others who will automatically be sent to the Democratic convention and who account for about 20 percent of all delegates. As a result Mr. Gore will likely start with almost 40 percent of the delegates he needs for the nomination. Mr. Gore a Tennessean will also benefit from deep loyalty among blacks and other minority groups as well as among white Southern Democrats who may have a predisposition to back a fellow white Southerner.''Any time you have two people on the ballot there's a possibility that either can win'' said David Axelrod a strategist in Chicago who has advised the Gore campaign. ''But I think the odds are very much in Gore's favor because of the many advantages he brings to the race. Part of the Hart deal that made him so strong in Iowa is that he snuck up on Mondale; there's no sneaking up on the radar screen here.''

8,Federal officials say that rabies is now widespread in Maryland and Pennsylvania and they fear its steady advance will reach the suburbs of Philadelphia in a year. The same outbreak of the disease has also reached epidemic proportions in South Carolina Georgia and Florida.The East Coast epidemic is one of two in the country. Another carried by skunks has spread the disease from Texas north to Minnesota and from Kentucky west to the Dakotas according to the Centers for Disease Control. In addition rabies is common in bats in much of the country.There were 5599 confirmed cases of rabid animals in the country last year according to the centers more than twice the 2675 reported in 1975. So far this year 2382 cases have been reported which the Centers for Disease Control said was slightly ahead of last year's rate.Dr. Fishbein attributed part of the rise however to better reporting and record-keeping.As the disease spreads into more densely populated areas however contact between rabid animals and humans is becoming increasingly common. These are among recent incidents:* A 15-year-old girl was bitten in the leg in March by a raccoon while sitting on her porch in Hanover Pa.* More than 30 people were exposed when they played with a rabid kitten on two farms in Frederick County Md. The kitten also bit a New Jersey woman at a gift shop through her boot. Health officials conducted a vast but unsuccessful search for the woman whose name was not known to the officials.* A 6-year-old boy was bitten by a groundhog while waiting for a school bus in York County.* An 87-year-old man was bitten by the family's pet donkey in central Pennsylvania. The man and all emergency room personnel who helped treat his deep wound had to be vaccinated.Such incidents have caused alarm in the region's tiny towns whose residents rarely vaccinate their pets and often allow them to roam. Local officials report an increase in the number of abandoned animals and at least one case of what they described as ''panic.'' Group Forms to Get Cat
0,Lately I’ve apologized to Marguerite H. for suggesting that she was insensitive to genocide in Darfur and today let me express profound contrition to a wronged breed of dog. In my Tuesday column I made a passing reference to “the White House and its Dobermans” referring to Paul Wolfowitz Don Rumsfeld and assorted hacks in the news media.Deborah wrote from San Diego to take offense: “As the proud owners of 3 Doberman Pinschers for the last 25 years we take umbrage at your attempt to compare this honest trustworthy loyal courageous loving and devoted breed with the current occupants of the White House. No Doberman Pinscher would ever cravenly run away from a fight ala Bush Cheney and Wolfowitz and then 30 years later set loose the dogs of war while cynically accusing those objecting of cowardice and treason. You owe Dobermans everywhere an apology.”So here it is. I’m sorry Dobermans!

9,It may not have the cultural or political wattage of New York City but Hartford has touched off its own tussle over taste and publicly financed art.Hartford officials prompted by complaints from more than a dozen citizens and a member of City Council have postponed a sexually charged exhibit that was scheduled to open on Oct. 21 in a city gallery in a city park next to a city playground.The centerpiece of the exhibit ''Domesticated Pleasures'' is a set of seven ceramic sexual devices one for each day of the week.''It's sort of like a calendar'' said the artist Tanya Batura.But many callers to City Hall said yesterday that they found it more like pornography. They compared Miss Batura's show to the exhibition scheduled to open tomorrow at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
0,Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times The multimedia revue of the life and work of Stephen Sondheim that fizzled earlier this year at the Alliance Theater of Atlanta will be plugged back in on Broadway by Roundabout Theater Company. On Thursday Roundabout said that it would produce “Sondheim on Sondheim” a project with music and lyrics by Mr. Sondheim conceived and directed by his frequent collaborator James Lapine. This new work will star Barbara Cook a Tony Award winner for “The Music Man” (and nominee for her 2002 concert event “Mostly Sondheim”) in her first Broadway musical in more than 37 years as well as Vanessa Williams (a Tony nominee for “Into the Woods”) Leslie Kritzer (“Rooms: A Rock Romance”) and Michael Arden with additional cast members to be announced shortly. “Sondheim on Sondheim” is to begin previews on Studio 54 on March 19 with an official opening of April 22. Its limited run concludes on June 13. A roster of songs was not immediately announced. The project at the Alliance Theater called “iSondheim” was to have featured music from shows including “Gypsy” “West Side Story” and “Sweeney Todd” but was canceled due to fund-raising difficulties.

0,THE DAYSenator Barack Obama got both help and trouble from his family Saturday. The trouble: An aunt from Kenya was reported to be living in Boston public housing even though she was ordered to leave the country in 2004. The help: Vice President Dick Cheney a distant cousin of Mr. Obama endorsed his opponent Senator John McCain providing much fodder for gleeful Democrats.* Republicans went after Mr. Obama on patriotism. Seizing on Mr. Obama’s remark that his caucus victory in Iowa ”vindicated” his faith in America Mr. McCain said “my country has never had to prove anything to me.” At a Sarah Palin rally in Florida the crowd chanted “John McCain not Hussein.”* Lots of laugh lines. After Virginia and Pennsylvania Mr. McCain headed to New York to appear on “Saturday Night Live.” Mr. Obama on the road in Nevada Colorado and Missouri beat Mr. McCain to the punch line by congratulating him on the Cheney endorsement. “He really earned it” Mr. Obama said.Takeaway: If it looks like the two candidates and their running mates are crossing paths that’s because they are. The candidates are practically living in Virginia Pennsylvania Ohio and Florida as the race boils down to a handful of states. Mr. Obama remains ahead in all four. —Peter BakerCLOSING ARGUMENTSSenator John McCainAt a rally in Newport News Va.:“With our troops engaged in two wars with a force in need of rebuilding we’re getting a glimpse of what one party rule would look like under Obama Pelosi and Reid and we don’t like that. Apparently it starts with lowering our defenses and raising our taxes. ”Senator Barack ObamaAt a rally in Pueblo Colo.:“George Bush may be in an undisclosed location but Dick Cheney’s out there on the campaign trail because he’d be delighted to pass the baton to John McCain. He knows that with John McCain you get a twofer: George Bush’s economic policy and Dick Cheney’s foreign policy. But that’s a risk we cannot afford to take.”NOW PLAYINGMcCain: “Freedom.” Swelling music flags galore and emotionally powerful footage of Mr. McCain as a prisoner of war and returning home. His closing argument is the same as the one that brought his campaign back to life a year ago: “I’ve served my country since I was 17 years old. And spent five years longing for her shores. I came home dedicated to a cause greater than my own.” End thought: “Don’t hope for a stronger America. Vote for one.”Obama: “Rearview Mirror.” Back to the McCain=Bush argument while hitting back at Mr. McCain over taxes. A driver sees President Bush in the rearview mirror Mr. McCain in the sideview mirror and ominous warnings about Mr. McCain’s tax policies in road signs. Ending: Bush and McCain together in that rearview mirror. “Look behind you. We can’t afford more of the same.”THE ROAR“I believe the right leader for this moment in history is Senator John McCain. John is a man who understands the danger facing America. He’s a man who has looked into the face of evil and not flinched. He’s a man who’s comfortable with responsibility and has been since he joined the armed forces at the age of 17. He’s earned our support and confidence and the time is now to make him commander-in-chief.”Vice President Dick Cheney endorsing John McCain“Barack Obama is going to win. He’s got a good chance because he’s a Kenyan and you can’t beat a Kenyan at a race.”Chris Rock the comedian at a get-out-the-vote rally in Tampa“John McCain! Not Hussein!”Chant at a rally for Gov. Sarah Palin in New Port Richey Fla.“First order of business for Sarah Palin on her return to Alaska: Order the Alaska National Guard across the border to Canada.”-“Mark” on the Caucus blog in a comment responding to a report that Ms. Palin had been prank called by a pair of Canadian comedians posing as French President Nicolas Sarkozy.ON DECKIf you live in Pennsylvania or Ohio you might want to stay away from the airports as the candidates buzz in and out these next two days.* Senator John McCain will campaign Sunday in Pennsylvania including Scranton the hometown of the Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. then heads to New Hampshire. Senator Barack Obama makes three stops in Ohio – Columbus Cincinnati and Cleveland.* Florida heat: Both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain end their day making the long nighttime flights down to the Sunshine State — Mr. McCain to Miami for a post-midnight rally Mr. Obama to Jacksonville even later but he’s going to bed.* Top campaign strategists and campaign surrogates fan out for a final pre-election Sunday TV television show blitz. The clash with the biggest chance of blood left on the studio floor will come on “This Week” on ABC: featuring Rick Davis Mr. McCain’s campaign manager and David Axelrod Mr. Obama’s chief strategist. Could be a rematch of their verbal slugfest on “Fox News Sunday” three weeks ago. These boys don’t seem to like each other much.
1,“Eden as We Recall” a delicate work by Stacy Spence is a dance about space: What does a room feel like? What influence does the environment have on the body? At Danspace Project where the piece was performed as part of its Platform 2012: Judson Now series Mr. Spence excavated St. Mark’s Church with his movement and with his eyes.Elements were arranged on the stage with deliberation. A screen showed an image of two doorways side by side. Audio equipment sat on the floor near four white benches that lined the area directly in front of the audience. On one side of the benches were spools of white and orange string masking tape keys and paper; on the other Mr. Spence sat with his back to us.PhotoEven before the dance started Mr. Spence’s barely-there movements — crossing a leg adjusting the position of an upturned palm shifting the weight of a hip — were unmistakable. It helped that the lighting design by Carol Mullins kept the space perpetually bright and that Mr. Spence is all skin and bones. A longtime member of the Trisha Brown Dance Company he can shift from brittle to fluid at a moment’s notice.Of Mr. Spence’s collaborators the sound artist Tei Blow and the dancer Brandi Norton (another Trisha Brown alum) Mr. Blow is the more compelling. Using a microphone and a recording device he created a score by plucking string ripping paper or brushing the microphone along Mr. Spence’s body and then playing it back. “Eden as We Recall” which most likely refers to Eden’s Expressway the scrappy SoHo studio where the piece was first conceived becomes as much about sound as about space.The details you normally gloss over — the way a wall juts out or ordinary background noise — are brought to the forefront in “Eden.” Mr. Spence caressed the air as if he were touching objects even when there was nothing there but he also moved brashly whipping into a sudden attitude turn with a raised bent knee or flinging himself into the air with outstretched arms.Still as compelling as Mr. Spence is — and such advanced articulation of the body is always weirdly titillating — “Eden” has its fair share of dullness. Ms. Norton’s appearance midway through came like an afterthought. At its heart “Eden” is a sensory trip for two.

0,Hillary Rodham Clinton got a reminder in Iowa today of just how divisive the issue of immigration is –- on both sides of the ideological spectrum. She drew a lusty chorus of boos from advocates of laws permitting illegal immigrants to become citizens as she spoke at the Heartland Forum a Democratic presidential forum organized by a collection of community groups here.It happened as Mrs. Clinton was pressed on whether she was prepared within the first 100 days of her presidency to push through legislation that would give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. The question drew applause.“I have been in favor of a path to citizenship for years” Mrs. Clinton said according to a transcript provided by Radio Iowa. “I voted it in the Senate and as president comprehensive immigration reform will be a high priority for me.”She drew a scattering of applause but her questioner pressed Mrs. Clinton about whether she would do that in her first 100 days.“You’ve got to get the Congress to pass the legislation” she said talking over boos from one corner of the room. “The president can do as much as possible which I will do.”

9,Leading the conference was Mariana O. Beraja a first-grade teacher who is the cabinet's chairwoman. Dr. Stone who will become principal of a school that she has designed sat at Mrs. Beraja's left shoulder and in theory had no larger voice than any of the members though her remarks seemed to carry more weight. Ultimately she could veto a cabinet decision though she has never had to do that.Throughout the meeting cabinet members freely offered their suggestions with Dr. Stone listening intently. Though she has relinquished some authority to the cabinet she continues to play the principal's typical role. She visits classrooms and evaluates teachers. She sees parents who may have complaints or questions. She handles repairs purchases and correspondences.''I'm still the final word the final sign-off'' she said.But decisions that affect curriculum working conditions and pupil achievement are made by the cabinet of which she is only a member. The cabinet in some ways also has broader powers than principals usually do. The 130 school-based management schools can ask the Dade County School Board for waivers on spending money earmarked for special programs waivers from the teachers' union contract and even waivers from state rules.Several years ago the Hadley cabinet decided that the school's children were doing too little writing and too many rote exercises using photocopied work sheets and so it set a limit of 12 copies a teacher per month. When a vacancy opened up for a kindergarten teacher cabinet representatives interviewed the 15 applicants. When teachers do the selection Mrs. Beraja said ''we as peers get together and make sure that person is successful because we hired her.''More Report CardsAt the Bunche Park Elementary School in Opa-Locka a school that has a sizable program for handicapped and mentally retarded children the cabinet decided that teachers would issue report cards six times a year rather than four as in most district schools and require parents to pick them up on two of those occasions. Shy or resistant parents would thus be compelled to meet their childrens' teachers.''It's school-based management at it best'' said Suzan Hess a teacher-administrator who is chairwoman of the cabinet. ''No other school did it. It was generated by our staff because we felt our population of parents needs this information.''Kathleen Phillips a speech specialist at Bunche Park did not like the idea of teaching children who had been pulled out of their regular classes and she decided she wanted an all-day classroom for children with speech handicaps. She wrote a proposal to the cabinet she recalls and ''they said 'Great go for it.' ''

8,L ong before the doors opened at the OTB parlor on John Street yesterday the line of bettors stretched for part of a furlong toward Nassau Street. They stood with Racing Forms in their hands and what passed for hopeful expressions on their faces.It was the first day of operations for the office No. 147 in the city's Offtrack Betting system. The opening of a parlor has become an event. It was only the second this year. In fact there are eight or nine fewer betting offices now than several years ago reflecting a malaise that lingers like a tapped-out player.''A $2 bet is a $2 bet is a $2 bet'' said Sam Kanchuger an OTB spokesman. ''It's a bad paraphrase of Gertrude Stein. But it's getting very hard to keep the growth going.''By that Mr. Kanchuger means that rent and salaries are going up faster than the OTB handle. In the 1980 fiscal year $893 million was bet at offtrack windows. That dropped the next year to $869 million. It was back up in fiscal 1982 ending last June but the $882 million was still below the 1980 figure.

1,In the United States and in France investors have swooped in and bought big stakes of companies without anyone knowing Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column this week. Given the importance of transparency in the markets he asks shouldn’t something be done about these legal if aggressive maneuvers?Big Investors Appear Out of Thin AirBy ANDREW ROSS SORKINAbout a week ago Bernard Arnault’s fashion empire LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton surprised the French establishment by announcing that it had acquired a 17 percent stake in Hermès International. Two weeks earlier Bill Ackman the activist hedge fund investor and Vornado Realty Trust the real estate company shocked Wall Street when they disclosed that they had acquired a nearly 27 percent stake in J.C. Penney the mass-market retailer.But hold on a minute: how is it possible that these corporate raiders were able to accumulate such large positions without anyone knowing?In the United States — and in France — regulators require all investors to disclose anytime they accumulate more than a 5 percent ownership stake in a company. The rule in the United States known as 13D along with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act which requires activist investors to disclose when they invest more than about $60 million is meant to provide the markets with a sense of transparency so that certain investors cannot just sneak up out of nowhere.And yet that is exactly what seems to be happening.Mr. Ackman took advantage of a rule giving investors 10 days to disclose their position after breaking the 5 percent ownership threshold. In his case once he passed the threshold he and Vornado sprinted to buy up tens of millions of shares before having to show their hand.Mr. Arnault’s approach was perhaps more insidious: he used derivatives to build up a stealth position in Hermès starting in 2008 so that he would not have to declare ownership until he was ready to pounce.It is all legal. But the real question is Should it be?“Unless and until lawmakers and securities regulators in the U.S. adopt disclosure requirements in accord with what is now the global consensus toward full and fair disclosure of equity derivatives and other synthetic and nonstandard ownership and control techniques U.S. corporations are well advised to adopt such self-help measures as are available” Adam O. Emmerich and William Savitt partners at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz wrote in a note to clients.Corporate boards have removed many of their defenses like poison pills in the last several years as part of efforts to be more open and democratic under pressure from shareholders and powerful advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services.But the 13D rule and others like it have not been updated in decades. Years ago in an age before e-mail a 10-day grace period for disclosure might have made sense; today it makes less. In Britain for example the rules are much stricter: investors have just 48 hours to declare passing a 3 percent threshold making it virtually impossible to build up a large stake without the markets having fair warning.The use of derivatives to create stealth positions is even more worrisome. In 2008 I wrote about this topic when Jana Partners a hedge fund used a series of swaps to buy a 21 percent stake in CNet. Since then other examples have emerged: A judge ruled that the Children’s Investment Fund had improperly used derivatives to influence the vote in a proxy contest involving CSX the railroad company. The judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the practice “permits a long party to ambush an issuer with a holding far greater than 5 percent.”In the case of LVMH’s ambush of Hermès Mr. Arnault explained in a filing that his company had acquired contracts on financial futures called equity swaps in 2008 “on the equivalent of 5 million and 4.8 million shares of Hermès whose deadlines were set between January and May 2011.” Then LVMH through subsidiaries “entered into amendments to these contracts so that they would receive physical delivery of underlying securities.”It is a clever gambit. And it does not appear to have skirted any law.A spokesman for LVMH Jim Fingeroth of Kekst & Company declined to comment. In a strange twist Mr. Fingeroth also happens to represent J.C. Penney; he declined to comment on its behalf as well.There is another side to this story. In speaking with a handful of investors’ activists who have employed some of these practices themselves — and refused to comment on the record for obvious reasons — it is clear that if the government reduced the 10-day period that investors had to disclose their positions after passing 5 percent these investors would not seek to take such stakes because it would be too expensive.Other investors rarely complain about stealth accumulation because it typically benefits them. During the 10-day period that Mr. Ackman and Vornado raced to buy up shares of J.C. Penney the company’s shares rose 45 percent. If you believe in shareholder democracy and in what many of these activists do is press for changes on management and within boards and they argue that placing higher barriers to ownership would make them less likely not more to pursue change.“No one would be able to build a stake in anything” one activist investor said. “We think we’re ultimately good for the capital markets.”True. But given the ultimate push for more transparency in the markets it seems like a conversation that regulators should consider having.Go to Previous DealBook Column »

One day I was walking down the hall at school and a kid passed me wearing the jacket. "That's my jacket" I said. "No it's not" the kid sneered. One of the deans of the school happened to walk by at this moment and asked what the problem was. "Look in the sleeves" I told him. My mother had written GRIFFITH in permanent black marker in each sleeve. Sure enough when the dean turned the right sleeve inside out there was my name.Things were like that then. Open and shut. Yes it is. No it isn't. Everything seemed good clean and orderly. I learned that there was such a thing as justice-I had witnessed it.At night I was learning that war could be humane and just. Night after night first person footage from the nose of smart bombs allowed me to see with my own eyes that American bombers weren't dumping their payloads indiscriminately over cities like the Germans did to Britain and the Brits did to Germany and we did to the Japanese during World War II. These were "smart" bombs; this was a "smart" war in all the various connotations of "smart": intelligent; shrewd and calculating; amusingly clever; with a neat and well-cared-for appearance; fashionable and stylish; vigorous and brisk; causing a sharp stinging sensation.Our history teacher didn't talk about the Gulf War. She didn't even pull down a map of the world and point to the Middle East so that we at least knew where it was taking place. Then again I suppose she had bigger problems to worry about-some kids in the class couldn't locate Illinois on a map.Neither do I remember talking about the war with my friends unless it was to ask whether we'd seen the latest awesome press conference footage-General Schwarzkopf standing in front of a television monitor narrating the flight of a bomb as it entered the chimney of a building or through the window of a munitions depot.Oddly enough I thought about the war the most when I was at band practice. That fall the band director a man named Scott Casagrande passed out the sheet music for Symphony No. 1 (In Memoriam Dresden 1945) a piece dedicated to the firebombing and subsequent obliteration of the German city of Dresden. One look at the part in front of me and I could tell that this was unlike anything I'd seen before. The parts were written aleatorically meaning that instead of notes on the staff creating a melody and countermelody there were diagrams and instructions telling us to play our instruments in unorthodox ways to represent the bombing of the city. The trombones were to drone on a low B flat to mimic the rumble of bombers approaching the city. The trumpets sounded the wailing air raid sirens. Next the score instructed the entire band to frantically whisper the words "firestorm" over and over in German to capture the panicked gossip that spread through the city as the first wave of bombers dropped jellied gasoline in order to prepare the way for the incendiary bombs that would ignite the city.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe trombone drone of the bombers continued as the flutes began mimicking the sound of bombs whistling toward the earth. The percussion section commanded a whole battery of drums to conjure up the bomb blasts and shook thunder out of a sheet of metal. As Dresden burned we blew air through our horns to create the violent winds brought on by the rapidly rising heat that sucked victims into the burning rubble of buildings and blew over structures weakened by the initial blasts. When it was all done roughly 30000 civilians had been killed many buried alive in basement bomb shelters and then burned beyond recognition by the great fire that burned for weeks to come. After playing the piece I always felt emotionally drained and distant as though I had experienced something traumatic having felt the presence of a darker reality.I don't remember when I first had the idea but at some point I approached Mr. Casagrande and asked him if I could find some images that could be projected on a screen above the band while we played. I have to believe that this idea wouldn't have been possible without the live war footage I took in every night on CNN. I was not a technologically savvy kid. (I used to hold a tape recorder up to the television to record my favorite songs from MTV.) But hearing this music I saw images.At the public library I found photos from books on World War II: bombers in flight photos of bombs falling in a cluster aerial photos of the majestic city of Dresden with its Baroque domes and soaring spires. I found photos of the city on fire photos of the smoldering wrecked buildings and finally photos of a wooden cart piled with scorched black corpses.The AV director Mr. Baldwin made the photos into slides and then over the course of several rehearsals I sequenced them to the music so that the image of bombers corresponded to the droning of the trombones the falling bombs corresponded to the whistling of the flutes and so on.On the night of the performance I stood back behind the heavy black curtain at the rear of the stage with my finger on the button of the slide projector. I began with a picture of the city before the bombing and then toggled back and forth between the image of the bombers in flight and the cluster of bombs falling toward earth in order to give the sensation of many bombers dropping many bombs.I felt powerful like the Great Oz proud to be inspiring fear in this audience of parents and school administrators perhaps disturbing their pat notions of war and its costs. In some ways I've been trying to get back to that feeling ever since-trying to find moments where what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing come together to reveal a disturbing truth.However I must confess at no point as I stood behind that curtain was I consciously thinking of the war in Iraq. Dresden was different I told myself. Dresden was butchery barbarity. The bombing of Iraq as I saw on television every night for a few months was clean efficient just.IT IS FOUR DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS 2004. Earlier today a U.S. base in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul was bombed-at least two dozen are dead the latest casualties of an insurgency that seems to be gaining zeal as the first fully democratic Iraqi elections in over thirty years approach. It is an insurgency born in part by what the Bush administration has been calling the "catastrophic success" of the land war which ended-"mission accomplished"-now over nineteen months ago. It is an insurgency-a phantom freedom hating force-made up of innumerable guerrilla outfits without uniforms flags or discernable national identity.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyWhat unifies them according to many are the abusive practices of the occupying force. Nowhere are these allegations more visible and perhaps well founded than the photos that have emerged from Abu Ghraib prison.The photos from Abu Ghraib have catalyzed a new generation of politically-motivated Iraqi artists. A large-scale mural on a wall in Baghdad's Sadr City reproduces the image of the naked and hooded detainee standing atop a box electrical wires attached to his fingers. Next to him stands the Statue of Liberty dressed in a white robe and hood reminiscent of the Klan's famous disguises poised to throw the switch that will send electricity singing through the wires. A more formal gathering of this new art could be seen at the Hewar Art Gallery in the Wazerieh district of central Baghdad. In June of 2004 twenty-five artists showed their work the image of the hooded detainee is reflected over and over in plaster and marble sculptures paintings and installation pieces. The image of the hooded detainee speaks to the perceived corruption of the American occupation and the deep hypocrisy of America a nation founded on religious tolerance compassion and universal justice.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Any allegations of abuse are being investigated and taken seriously.But are the Abu Ghraib photos and the allegations of abuse at Guantanamo just a matter of a few American troops a few "bad apples" acting on their own or is the picture-taking more widespread: are digital pictures part of a new interrogation protocols tailored to exploit Muslim cultural values?CIA Department of Defense and Justice Department memos squabbling over the definition of torture condoning low-grade torture in the war against terrorism confirm that there is no clear policy stating how prisoners in the War on Terror should be treated.The Abu Ghraib photos as well as countless other allegations of abuse torture are evidence of the shadowy boundary between legal and immoral.So what do the Abu Ghraib photos actually show us? Cropped yes the pictures suggest the work of only a handful of reservists. But uncropped they show more soldiers some identified as military intelligence officers standing around a few watching others preoccupied with the most mundane activities. One picture reveals a man cleaning his fingernails.Images of such crass disregard become more than just evidence. They become icons Rorschachs used by commentators to justify criticize or deconstruct the war and the United States.Many of the pictures resemble grotesque political cartoons-human pyramids; a prisoner in a cruciform pose atop a box with red wires curling away from his fingers; prisoners pantomiming sexual acts; prisoners cowering before attack dogs. They're impossible caricatures their effects exaggerated because removed from the larger more complicated context of the war. They are images even the most zealous anti-war cartoonist would feel uneasy imagining let alone sketching. And there are hundreds of unreleased photos that have been blocked for release by the Pentagon due to their outrageousness their ability to inspire perhaps an all out Holy War that are said to be much worse scenes of rape and even murder.Advertisement Continue reading the main storySome commentators-mostly conservatives such as Robert Knight of Concerned Women of America but even left-wing social critic Susan Sontag-cited our society's addiction to hard-core pornography to explain the scandal. Why else would the abuse have included so much nudity sex sadomasochism-and exhibitionism in the form of extensive photo and video documentation? In their view the prison was an outpost of our debased porn-soaked culture.Consider the two main protagonists in this spectacle: Army Corporal Charles Graner Jr.-an alleged wife beater once divorced now serving ten years in a military prison for his role as the so-called ringleader of the late night abuse and Army Pfc. Lynndie England seen giving exuberant thumbs-up gestures while standing in front of naked hooded prisoners now serving three years for mistreating prisoners. (Some of the unreleased photos are said to show England having sex with other MPs.)Military defense lawyers attempted to paint Graner England and the rest as duty-bound reservists who were following orders from their superiors whose apparent zeal portrayed in the photos was the result of extreme psychological duress: the pressures of guarding so many prisoners; the nightly mortar attacks; the knowledge that fellow soldiers were denying due to the lack of intelligence. After all psychological experiments have proved that anyone given the right conditions can become a torturer right? In this scenario the abuse is reduced to a problem of abnormal psychology.But moral and psychological interpretations of the scandal-usually in the service of ideology-fall short. There's another tragic spiritual sense in which to understand the disturbing images of Abu Ghraib a view formed by notions of innocence sin and grace.* * *CATHOLIC WRITER FLANNERY O'CONNOR would have considered the images of the prison scandal grotesque but not in what she called "the pejorative sense"-of just plain images of ugliness and ignorance. For O'Connor-whose characters are some of the most memorable grotesqueries in American literature-the grotesque makes visible hidden "discrepancies" between character and belief. Such images "connect or combine or embody two points; one is a point in the concrete and the other is a point not visible to the naked eye."Take Cpl. Graner for example. His pick-up truck still parked in the driveway of his Uniontown Pennsylvania home at the time the pictures broke into the news bears a license plate with the word Jesus and a picture of a cross. There is also a smooth stone in appropriately enough a "weed-choked" flower bed in front of his house painted with a verse from the book of Hosea: "Sow for yourselves righteousness reap the fruit of unfailing love and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to see the Lord until he comes and showers righteousness on you." [Hoses 10:12 NIV]This stone is mentioned in most of the early news coverage of the scandal treated as a bit of profound irony the kind of coincidence newspaper reporters salivate over. How could a man with this bit of scripture displayed in his "postage-stamp" of a front yard as one Pittsburgh news weekly described it commit such atrocious acts? It's an irony the media isn't equipped to engage at any depth.Such ironies were the stuff of O'Connor's stories. Her characters think of themselves as Christians or otherwise "good people" but their actions or attitudes reveal otherwise. Their pride blinds them to their own flaws and only violence-usually from an unlikely source-opens their eyes and offers them a chance at redemption.
9,A United Nations envoy called today for the Security Council to send more peacekeeping soldiers to Bosnia and Herzegovina and give them new powers to counter abuses including the practice known as "ethnic cleansing" that has made refugees of scores of thousands of Bosnians mainly Muslims.The envoy former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland said the United Nations peacekeepers were powerless to prevent the "massive and grave violations of human rights occurring throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina."Blaming all sides in the conflict for such abuses Mr. Mazowiecki's report singles out the fate of Bosnia's beleaguered Muslims as being "particularly tragic" because "they feel that they are threatened with extermination."The former Polish Prime Minister who was sent to the Balkans by the United Nations Human Rights Commission to investigate violations said the United Nations should send more peacekeeping forces to the region let them patrol the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and order them to "react directly" to human rights violations assisting victims and reporting on all atrocities they witness.

9,The jury in John Gotti's racketeering-murder trial is to begin deliberations this morning after the judge excused one juror from the case yesterday and then gave the remaining panel members their final instructions.Judge I. Leo Glasser declined to disclose his reason for dismissing the juror a woman designated as Juror No. 3. But he said it did not involve any wrongdoing by any of the parties in the trial of Mr. Gotti and his co-defendant Frank Locascio in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.Under the judge's orders the identities of the jurors have been kept secret throughout the trial for their security and privacy. The judge who said he had questioned all the jurors individually yesterday morning before releasing juror No. 3 told two reporters representing the press corps that it was not unusual to question juries and to dismiss some members in criminal trials.The dismissal of the juror is believed to have been requested by the prosecution which contended that she was prejudiced against the Government based on a note found among her possessions in a routine search by marshals.

0,SINGAPORE Sept. 30 - Even as Asia worries about a possible avian influenza pandemic a much more common disease is sweeping the region borne on the wings of mosquitoes and commercial aircraft: the dengue virus.At least 127000 people have been infected by dengue so far this year along an arc that stretches from eastern India through the Indonesian archipelago with at least 990 deaths the health authorities say. Warning of a dengue epidemic Malaysia recently joined Singapore in declaring emergency measures to combat a surge in cases that has killed at least 70 people. While those two countries are experiencing record infections the worst-affected has been populous Indonesia with more than 48000 cases and more than 600 deaths."Dengue is now one of the most important tropical diseases" said Duane Gubler director of the Asia-Pacific Institute for Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine. "While it doesn't kill that many people it has tremendous economic and social impact."Dengue is from the same family of viruses that causes West Nile Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever. There is no vaccine or treatment and it is estimated to infect at least 50 million people a year. Those with acute cases suffer painful fever and debilitating lethargy with about 1 percent developing hemorrhagic fever or shock sometimes with gastrointestinal bleeding and in rare cases brain hemorrhages.

9,He said a speech to the players on Thursday by General Manager Bryan Murray best summed up his own thoughts. Murray thanked them for a distinguished season and added "It's not over yet."Then Vanbiesbrouck noted wryly "Maybe he had that speech then so he didn't have to have it tomorrow."If Murray thought it might be a farewell address he apparently did not have much company. A growing number of the Panthers seem to believe they are a team of destiny even as a third-year expansion team."I'll believe in destiny a lot more if we win Game 7" Bill Lindsay said.Defenseman Terry Carkner was blunt in his assessment of the final game. "I think Pittsburgh's a better team" he said. "But that doesn't mean we can't win."That's because Tom Fitzgerald said the Panthers have seen the value of all-out persistence."We're a team that believes in each other" he said. "I remember early in the season we were down 6-1 or 6-2 to Pittsburgh and we never quit. We wound up losing by a goal and we came close to taking the thing into overtime."

1,PHILADELPHIA — With Ike Davis continuing to play well the chances of Daniel Murphy returning to the Mets as their regular first baseman are becoming increasingly remote. So the Mets are considering sending Murphy to Class AAA Buffalo where he will work on other positions such as second base and left field with the hope that he can add to their depth as a utility player.The process could take a long time especially at second base even though Murphy played at the position in the Arizona Fall League. Murphy is recovering from a right knee sprain and just started playing in extended spring training games Friday.

0,When the author of this book first heard of a technique known variously as brain-wave biofeedback neurofeedback and neuro therapy he was battling chronic fatigue syndrome and had exhausted traditional therapies.Though it ''had a New Age whiff about it'' he nonetheless traveled to a weekend symposium got his scalp hooked up to a computer display via electroencephalogram sensors and began a session of brain-training.''After a half hour'' he recalls ''my mind was tired my thoughts muddled. But an hour or so after I finished I experienced what is known as the clean windshield effect. The world looked sharp and crystalline and I had a quiet energetic feeling that lasted a couple of hours. It was the first time I had felt that way in years.''Biofeedback which has been around for some 30 years harnesses the body's natural rhythms -- brain waves and autonomic functions -- to monitors that allow one to see for example amplified electrical frequencies of the brain or usually unconscious occurrences like blood pressure and heart and lung action.By watching these events on a computer screen participants are able to influence their physical and mental well-being. In neurofeedback patients can be trained to operate in brain frequencies they do not generally use an exercise designed to enable one to strengthen the brain.Mr. Robbins a journalist whose articles occasionally appear in The New York Times focuses on the brain-strengthening aspects of the technique making a decent case through interviews with clinicians researchers and patients for its value in a variety of disorders including autism epilepsy attention deficit disorder learning disabilities head injuries post traumatic stress disorder addictions and depression.He argues that though the medical profession is generally dismissive of the therapy the effects of neurofeedback are ''not subtle but extremely robust.''It may not be either miracle or panacea he writes but it is science albeit science that is still young and relatively unknown. The big question about neurofeedback he concludes is not whether it works but ''why it is as effective as it is for whom precisely and how it can be made more powerful.''

9,The two Germanys have signed their treaty of unification the last major act of the German Democratic Republic before it disappears into a single Germany on Oct. 3. The question of its role in Europe indeed the role of nation-states in Europe becomes increasingly urgent as the countries to the East move on from the euphoria of freedom to the agony of transformation.Preoccupation with the Persian Gulf crisis has diverted attention from the critically decisive period ahead in Europe. It adds difficulties because it has always been harder for the Common Market to move in periods of economic dislocation such as the new oil shock will bring.The whole timetable of Europe's evolution has changed. There will be a new all-German government based on elections Dec. 2 even before the European Community (absorbing East Germany) begins its major meetings on monetary and political union later that month in Rome. Their results will determine whether there is a European Germany or a German Europe as the Federal Republic's Hans-Dietrich Genscher puts it.There are hints that Bonn's pledge for a strong new push to integration is eroding with the temptation of a special role in the East. There have been suspicions this would happen. But so far Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr. Genscher as well have insisted they are resolved to anchor the new Germany in a union with increasingly limited national sovereignties.

7,Miriam Bockman was unanimously elected the first woman leader of the Manhattan Democratic organization yesterday in a move that signaled the transfer of political power from Mayor Beanie to Representation Edward I. Koch the Democratic candidate for Mayor.The 45‐year‐old Mrs. Bockman who is the Democratic co‐leader in Greenwich Village was also the first member of the liberal often anti‐organization New Democratic Coalition to be elected a county chairman.Mr. Koch said earlier that he was not taking a position on the county leadership and he reiterated that statement when he made a surprise appearance last night at the meeting of the Manhattan Democratic executive committee after Mrs. Bockman had been elected.Mr. Koch and Mrs. Bockman have long been close friends and she works in the Koch mayoral campaign. They are both members of the Village Independent Democrats and Mrs. Bockman's co‐leader John LoCicero is one of Mr. Koch's top advisers.

9,After two years of criticism from Federal environmental officials Gov. George E. Pataki has announced plans to strengthen New York State's enforcement of environmental laws particularly those limiting air pollution from large sources like factories and power plants.The biggest shift would be an increase in inspections for pollution problems and a new emphasis on pursuing the worst violators. Those two factors were identified by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency as particularly weak in New York State last year.Senior E.P.A. officials said Mr. Pataki's planned changes could end a long decline in environmental enforcement in New York that began late in the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and worsened under Mr. Pataki. Some private environmental groups and political opponents were less optimistic.A low point was reached last year according to the E.P.A.'s continuing analysis of the state's programs. The Federal analysis concluded that fines were consistently too low inspections were far too few and the pursuit of big companies discharging hundreds of tons of pollutants into the air was ''minimal.''

0,More than 50 Special Operations troops have been active in the cave-riddled mountains of Tora Bora near Jalalabad. Some have been working with anti-Taliban Afghan militias who are searching through the caves for die-hard Al Qaeda members and intelligence documents. Other Americans including commandos and snipers have operated independently in their hunt for Al Qaeda warriors trying to escape into Pakistan.It was unclear which Americans were attacked today.In Kandahar Mr. Shirzai had been planning to send thousands of soldiers to begin a military campaign against the Taliban holdouts. But the plan was placed on hold late Sunday when Taliban commanders offered to surrender said Yusuf Pashtun a senior aide to Mr. Shirzai.''We have now canceled that plan'' Mr. Pashtun said this morning minutes before he left Kandahar for Helmand in a convoy that included the six American vehicles. The convoy stopped briefly in front of the house of Ahmed Karzai the brother and chief spokesman for Hamid Karzai the leader of Afghanistan's interim government.Afghan commanders said the Taliban had been given until Thursday to fulfill their surrender agreement.Sher Muhammad the governor of Helmand who was in Kandahar this morning said a force of Afghan soldiers and the American Special Forces troops were going to the towns of Musa Qala and Kajaki just south of Baghran. The Taliban were expected to surrender their weapons and vehicles in those towns before being allowed to return to their villages Mr. Muhammad said.Mr. Muhammad said the Taliban there are being led by a commander from the area named Abdul Waheed but better known as Rais Baghran. Mr. Muhammad added that the Taliban commander had insisted that Mullah Omar was not in Baghran an assertion that some anti-Taliban commanders seemed willing to believe.But Muhammad Zali another senior commander for Mr. Shirzai said the Taliban officials might be lying and buying time to allow Mullah Omar to escape. ''They will say anything'' Mr. Zali said. ''We cannot trust them. We have to search all the areas in Baghran to make sure Mullah Muhammad Omar is not there.''

7,The first major strike in the steel industry in 18 years closed iron ore mines and processing plants yesterday across northern Minnesota and Michigan the heart of the ore country.Some 16000 to 17000 workers were idled in the walkouts by the United Steelworkers of America which tied up about 85 percent of the nation's domestic iron ore output.The strikes do not immediately threaten steel production because a four‐month supply of ore and pellets had been stockpiled. They may however threaten the efficacy of the Experimental Negotiating Agreement between the industry and the union.Industry‐Wide Strikes ForbiddenIndustrywide strikes are forbidden under this agreement. But strikes on mine‐or plant‐level problems so‐called local issues are allowed. The union insists that the strikes are over such local issues.

1,SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — We’ve had a fair number of tough Saturday crosswords over the last few months and today’s offering does nothing to soften the curve. Robert H. Wolfe presents us with a mix of long entries sly clues and some challenging vocabulary in a wide-open grid.The grid is one that Mr. Wolfe has used three times in the past and its unusual windmill design is more than just a tribute to the letter T. The black squares divide the puzzle into four solving quadrants composed of only 58 total answers. Only seven other Times constructors have matched or bettered that feat for a 15×15 grid.One result of this is a total lack of three-letter entries and only four four-letter entries both of which can be helpful in cracking a themeless puzzle. The other result is an extremely high number of common letters. E R S and T account for 99 out of the 190 grid letters. An additional 40 letters are either A I or N. Assuming this in advance can help when solving.The Details:Did “Early 1990s first lady’s first name” have you searching in the United States when you should have been looking to Russia and Mr. Gorbachev’s bride? I wondered about the accuracy of “A conductor may have it memorized” for BUS LINE since I’m not familiar with bus drivers being referred to as conductors but the dictionary tells me otherwise. POLLUTERS for “They’re not green” was far down the line of interpretations I considered for that clue. YTTRIA or yttrium oxide is a compound that helps put the red in television picture tubes.The toughest crossing for me was STI_ES crossing SE_TIMES. I spent a fair amount of time looking at that missing letter until I vaguely remembered the word STIPE from somewhere deep in my brain. Thank goodness because SEPTIMES wasn’t going to come with or without that S on the end of it. Those were a bit out there but I guess there’s no arguing that “Way out there” yielded the most ESOTERIC answer.A Final Thought: Mr. Wolfe practices veterinary medicine on Long Island in New York at the Wolfe Animal Hospital. He’s been married 38 years with two daughters and a granddaughter runs three miles a day and plays the piano and guitar. He also writes poetry and has written a screenplay and a novel (as yet unsold) — as well as over 2000 crossword puzzles.Notice: The crossword community has lost Dan Naddor a prolific constructor who passed away Tuesday night from cancer-related causes. More than 100 of his puzzles were published in the Los Angeles Times over the last three years. He made his New York Times debut this past August (Across Lite Solution).

1,Savvy politicians know that it’s usually a good sign when a political advertisement provokes cries of outrage from the opposition. The picture gets murkier though when that same advertisement prompts high-minded expressions of disappointment from the politician’s own supporters. Sometimes that’s a signal that the ad in question has overreached and risks a backlash. But sometimes it’s just a sign that those high-minded supporters don’t recognize the weakness that the ad is trying to exploit or just don’t have the stomach for a necessary fight.This is the dilemma the Obama re-election campaign faces with the ad it released recently suggesting that Mitt Romney might not have given the order to send Navy SEALS to kill Osama Bin Laden. The attack clearly touched a nerve with Republicans but it also earned the White House a rebuke from several liberals including no less a left-wing eminence than Arianna Huffington.On the Early Show on CBS Huffington called the ad “despicable” suggested that questioning an opponent’s ability to serve as commander-in-chief is “not the way to run campaigns on either side” and compared the attack to the “3 A.M. phone call” ad Hillary Clinton’s campaign released in 2008 which made a similar case against then-candidate Obama’s ability to make the toughest national security decisions.When even Huffington thinks a Democratic attack goes too far it usually has. And yet a moment’s scrutiny reveals that her argument doesn’t make much sense. Why do we have election seasons after all if not to argue about which candidate would be better-suited to making decisions that put Americans in harm’s way overseas? How can we not politicize national security given how central it is to the work of the modern presidency and how unconstrained the executive branch’s national security powers have become no matter which party holds the White House?These are the arguments that Hillary Clinton partisans mounted in defense of that “3 A.M. ad” and that George W. Bush’s partisans mounted in defense of his 9/11-centric 2004 re-election campaign. And those arguments were right! It’s one thing to say that candidates shouldn’t impugn one another’s patriotism. But impugning a rival’s judgment as the Obama camp’s Bin Laden advertisement just did is precisely what a presidential campaign is for.Strategically too the White House has every reason to press these kind of arguments to the hilt. As I’ve noted in this space before most of President Obama’s record is unpopular – sometimes deeply so – with the voting public. But the big exception is national security where polls often show that Obama has built up a fair amount of credibility with voters. Foreign policy thus offers the White House its best (and perhaps only) opportunity to draw contrasts with Romney by highlighting the president’s actual accomplishments.Whereas on domestic issues the Romney camp can answer almost every Obama attack by changing the subject to the unemployment rate on foreign policy the Republican message is much more muddled and uncertain. In the usual order of things Romney would be simply try to out-hawk the president but this is not a hawkish moment in American politics. Outside of the most Republican portions of the electorate the Iraq War is still widely regarded as a bad blunder and even conservatives are increasingly supportive of a speedy exit from Afghanistan. Public opinion on Iran is unsettled but there is next to no support for the kind of stepped-up American intervention in Syria that some Republicans have championed.Meanwhile by keeping much of the Bush-era anti-terror architecture in place and stepping up covert warfare from Waziristan to the Horn of Africa the president has effectively undercut the soft-on-terror arguments that Republicans used so effectively against John Kerry in 2004. Indeed the most compelling criticisms of this White House have come from libertarians and anti-interventionists on both the left and right on issues ranging from the dubiously-legal “kinetic military action” in Libya to the White House’s willingness to order the assassination of an American citizen abroad.Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto AgencyThis explains why the Republican Party’s foreign policy rhetoric can seem so opportunistic and confused. The Rand Paul-led anti-interventionist wing of the party arguably has a more coherent case against the president than the more hawkish wing which often finds itself emphasizing what it has in common with the president – as Florida Senator Marco Rubio did in a widely-touted foreign policy address defending interventionism last week. (Tellingly the word “Iraq” did not appear in his remarks.) Yet the hawkish line of attack is still the Republican default and Mitt Romney’s case — to date at least — against the president has generally circled back to its tropes and premises.The result is an incoherence that James Poulos described well in a recent column in Forbes:With Obama the GOP has become like Woody Allen’s neurotic diner: the food is horrible and such small portions! The president is condemned for leading and for leading from behind; for relying too much on talk and too much on drones; for slavishly kowtowing to foreign leaders and for arrogantly refusing to stroke foreign leaders. Obama’s foreign policy has paralyzed the GOP by laying bare just how much Republicans collectively refuse to fully commit to one grand unifying possibility in international affairs — including the possibility of stepping away from sweeping principles and playing it by ear for a while.Arianna Huffington’s qualms notwithstanding it would be political malpractice for the president not to exploit this kind of confusion with national security attacks on his opponent. Indeed Republicans who care about these issues should welcome them. Advertisements like the Bin Laden spot and political stunts like last night’s almost-victory speech in Afghanistan present a challenge to the right but also an opportunity.The rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign affords conservatives their best chance yet to come to terms with the Bush era in foreign policy and its aftermath — to figure out what they think about the recent past where they stand at present and where they would have the country go from here.
9,STRING QUARTET NO. 13 (OP. 130). Vegh Quartet (Valois Auvidis V 4407).PIANO SONATAS NOS. 28 TO 32; "DIABELLI" VARIATIONS; BAGATELLES (OP. 126). Artur Schnabel pianist (Pearl GEMM CDS 9142; three CD's).FIVE works five Beethovens: the orchestral revolutionary of the "Eroica" Symphony the choral-orchestral visionary of the Missa Solemnis the generous lyricist of the "Archduke" Trio the cryptic poet of the Opus 130 Quartet the mercurial experimenter of the "Diabelli" Variations. Loyalty to my first musical love demands representation of the "Eroica" but otherwise my choices lean more toward the private elusive sides of Beethoven's all-embracing personality.For my money Otto Klemperer remains the conductor of Beethoven. His life an indomitable progress through mishaps and catastrophes echoed Beethoven's own. The power that emanated from this towering unbalanced brilliant man is reflected in one of his finest EMI recordings the Missa Solemnis. The trademark slow tempos rocklike beats and oratorical phrasings are not merely an assertion of conductorial will. Klemperer's fundamental straightforwardness places the original score first and foremost. Power cancels itself out; burning belief in the music remains.Klemperer's "Eroica" would have headed my list but EMI has mystifyingly exiled it to a boxed set. In its place I would recommend Toscanini's pulse-quickening live performance from 1939 reissued on an RCA mid-price disk. (Note also a strong "Eroica" in Herbert von Karajan's generally satisfying Beethoven cycle from 1963; Deutsche Grammophon's box of the nine symphonies can be had for $40 or less.)Alfred Cortot Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals singing through the "Archduke" Trio present a Beethoven vastly different from either Klemperer's or Toscanini's. Here music melts into civilized conversation smiling asides dreaming digressions. This is the world from which Schubert was born and a buoyant reading of Schubert's B flat Trio logically follows. The 1928 recording is highly listenable in French EMI's digital transfer: the distinctive poetic qualities of each artist come through with Casals's imperturbably noble tone at the heart of the sound.
9,Jack Whitten Paintings from the 1970's Daniel Newburg Gallery 43 Greene Street (near Broome Street) SoHo Through April 9 Jack Whitten Recent Paintings Horodner Romley Gallery 107-109 Sullivan Street (near Spring Street) SoHo Through April 9These joint exhibitions compare Jack Whitten's paintings from two decades ago with his current efforts and find them consistent. Mr. Whitten has stuck to his ambition shared with many others in the late 1960's and 70's to push painting and paint beyond the limits of the hand and brush. This approach which combined a lot of Minimalist predetermination with a little post-Minimalist randomness was probably inspired by Frank Stella's famous defense that "what you see is what you see."With their fields of fine horizontal lines and textures usually achieved by drawing a wide broom across the canvas Mr. Whitten's 70's paintings present sauve understated unities. Their blurry surfaces suggest television static when executed in black and white or erased abstract paintings when muted browns and reds are used. In the latter the pulled fields sometimes break revealing random strokes. Their resemblance to some of Gerhard Richter's early paintings and to the more current efforts of John Zinsser and Stephen Ellis is startling and a reminder that history is less single and linear than multiple and circular.At Horodner Romley Mr. Whitten's researches into the possibilities of paint have lead him to freeze strips of acrylic and then break them into little bits that resemble ceramic tile and can be formed into paintings that resemble mosaics. In a series of small canvases the designs are based on the forms of popcorn; in a much larger work a fleet of colorful circles and ellipses on a white ground has been inspired by buttons. There is something both witty and contrived about all this with only the button painting seeming worth the trouble.

1,Brendan Hoffman/Bloomberg NewsA senior lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission recently took center stage in a major case involving a controversial mortgage security sold by Goldman Sachs.There was just one slight twist in the legal proceedings. The S.E.C. lawyer was not the prosecutor taking the deposition. He was the witness.This summer Adam Glass — who joined the agency two years ago and is now co-chief counsel in charge of helping write the rules for the complex financial instruments known as derivatives — testified in a deposition about Goldman’s Abacus a mortgage investment that the government argues was designed to fail.It turns out that Mr. Glass has a unique perspective on Wall Street exotica. Before working on the financial crisis cleanup he helped create the opaque securities that contributed to the mess.Jin Lee/Bloomberg NewsFor many years Mr. Glass served as the outside counsel to Paulson & Company the giant New York hedge fund firm run by John Paulson who made billions betting against the housing market. And yes Mr. Glass in that role signed off on Abacus which was created specifically for the hedge fund to short subprime mortgages. Mr. Paulson handpicked some of the underlying investments in the derivative.The government in its complaint claimed that Goldman had “misstated and omitted key facts regarding” Abacus including disclosing Mr. Paulson’s role in its creation. The firm paid $550 million to settle the case without admitting or denying guilt. Mr. Paulson was never accused of any wrongdoing.Mr. Glass’s recent deposition was for a separate S.E.C. case against Fabrice Tourre the young Goldman trader who had developed and marketed Abacus to investors. Mr. Tourre 31 has denied the accusations.The revelation of Mr. Glass’s involvement in the Abacus deal could undermine the S.E.C.’s case — or at least prove to be a distracting embarrassment.Perhaps more important his role once again raises questions about the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street at a time when public distrust about the agency and its lack of enforcement action against the culprits of the crisis is running high.“There are a lot of talented people out there you could hire who weren’t necessarily part of the problem” said Mary Kreiner Ramirez a professor at Washburn University School of Law. “If he was involved in Abacus how is he supposed to police it?”Jacquelyn Martin/Associated PressIt is a common question as the government increasingly looks to fill its ranks with regulatory officials proficient in the language of Wall Street. Robert S. Khuzami the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement was previously the general counsel of Deutsche Bank. The agency tapped Eileen Rominger the former global chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs Asset Management as its director of investment management.“The revolving door is such a dominant fact about the S.E.C.’s culture” said John C. Coffee Jr. a Columbia Law School professor. “You get people who go to Washington for one to three years and then go back to Wall Street.”The pattern has been well documented. According to the Project on Government Oversight 219 former S.E.C. staff members filed 789 “postemployment statements indicating their intent to represent an outside client before the commission” from 2006 to 2010. In other words the one-time government officials are representing Wall Street clients with matters before the agency.While clearly there are questions about whether the public wants someone in government who just came from industry the opposite argument can be made too: It may be better to have the fox in the henhouse.The New York TimesPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt “justified appointing Joe Kennedy as chairman of the S.E.C. with the line: ‘You need to set a thief to catch a thief’ ” said Professor Coffee. “That is the case for bringing in an industry expert.”After all the best way for the government to stay ahead of financial innovations — or at least not fall too far behind — is to employ people who know them best.After the government’s bailout of A.I.G. some said the insurer should keep paying bonuses to employees as they were among the few who understood how to unwind some of the company’s complex trades.Mr. Glass who has long advocated more regulation of derivatives in certain instances came to the S.E.C. with a strong finance pedigree. A graduate of Harvard and of Stanford Law School Mr. Glass was a partner at Linklaters where he founded the firm’s structured finance and derivatives practice.In addition to Paulson & Company he counted Deutsche Bank and Lehman Brothers among his top clients. Mr. Glass was not involved in the controversial opinion that Linklaters issued to Lehman about a practice known as Repo 105 that has come under scrutiny. The tactic allowed Lehman to conceal billions of dollars on its balance sheet.Mr. Glass took a big pay cut to become a civil servant. The average Linklaters partner made about $2.3 million in 2008 the year before he left according to Legal Week an industry publication. The most Mr. Glass could make at the S.E.C. is $233000.When I asked Mr. Glass about his deposition in the Tourre case and his role as the lawyer for Mr. Paulson in the Abacus transaction he said “Yes that would be true.” He then directed me to the S.E.C.’s spokesman who quickly issued a “no comment.” Spokesmen for Mr. Tourre and Mr. Paulson also declined to comment.Mr. Glass was involved in reviewing the Abacus deal. He reviewed and commented on an “engagement letter” between Goldman and ACA the firm that insured the deal said three people with knowledge of his testimony and e-mails. He also received a draft copy of the “offering circular” and term sheet provided to outside investors but those documents did not include disclosures about how Mr. Paulson’s firm had selected certain mortgage-backed securities for the investment vehicle that he was betting against. The offering circular stated that ACA would select the initial portfolio.The potential obfuscation of Mr. Paulson’s role is at the center of the case against Mr. Tourre. Mr. Glass who testified that he did not recall seeing the offering document did not ask for additional disclosure about Mr. Paulson’s role or comment on the disclosure language said the people briefed on his deposition. But Mr. Glass had no legal duty to Goldman’s clients.Mr. Glass worked with Mr. Paulson’s firm to help structure similar mortgage deals and in one instance he pushed for additional disclosures. On a Deutsche Bank derivatives deal Mr. Glass suggested that the bank might want to include more explicit disclosure language for its clients according to a person briefed on the deal. Deutsche Bank did not take Mr. Glass’s advice.In the end Mr. Glass is tangential to the S.E.C.’s case against Mr. Tourre. But he is a central example in the age-old debate about the benefits and costs of Washington’s revolving door.“I don’t think Mr. Glass has done anything unethical in helping Mr.Paulson structure this product” Professor Coffee said.“But it is a case that will raise further questions about the S.E.C.”

9,IF reports of its death are greatly exaggerated liberalism may be ailing in New York City because of shifts in a sensitive sociological index: the ratio between condos and condoms.A larger proportion of New Yorkers now own their homes or apartments than at any time in the 20th century. And owners rendered less mobile physically and less liquid fiscally by their stakes in real estate tend to be more politically conservative than renters. Liberal leadership also has been diluted by divisions between black and Hispanic politicians and between white liberals and blacks and by the ascendancy of white liberals in the political establishment.As the share of property owners has grown the city has been riven by conflicts over what are loosely described as traditional social values -- values that have been put to the test as government usurped New Yorker's personal prerogatives by making condoms available to public school students teaching tolerance and acceptance of gay and lesbian life styles and ordering that a gay and lesbian group be allowed to march behind its own banner in the St. Patrick's Day parade.That those decisions have provoked a vocal backlash could mean several things: the group that once proclaimed itself the silent majority has found its voice again; the group is not a majority at all but has just become louder for the time being than other minorities; New York's reputation for liberalism like the reports of its demise has been greatly exaggerated a possibility raised by the conflicts that culminated in last month's 4-to-3 vote by the Board of Education to dismiss Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez or it could mean all of the above.
1,Joni Mitchell 71 was taken to a hospital in Los Angeles on Tuesday after she was found unconscious at her Los Angeles home. In recent years the singer has complained of a number of health problems including one particularly unusual ailment: Morgellons disease.PhotoPeople who believe they have the condition report lesions that don’t heal “fibers” extruding from their skin and uncomfortable sensations like pins-and-needles tingling or stinging. Sufferers may also report fatigue and problems with short-term memory and concentration.But Morgellons is not a medically accepted diagnosis. Scientists have struggled for nearly a decade to find a cause and have come up mostly empty-handed.Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied 115 people who said they had the condition. In a report published in 2012 they said they were unable to identify an infectious source for the patients’ “unexplained dermopathy.” There was no evidence of an environmental link and the “fibers” from patients resembled those from clothing that had gotten trapped in a scab or crusty skin.The investigators cast doubt on Morgellons as a distinct condition and said that it might be something doctors were already familiar with: delusional infestation a psychiatric condition characterized by an unshakable but erroneous belief that one’s skin is infested with bugs or parasites.Drug use can contribute to such delusions and the investigators noted evidence of drug use — prescription or illicit — in half of the people they examined. Of the 36 participants who completed neuropsychological testing 11 percent had high scores for depression and 63 percent unsurprisingly were preoccupied with health issues.These patients have a reduced quality of life the researchers concluded but the cause is not clear. Science one day may find that Morgellons has a physical basis but at the moment most experts treat it as a psychiatric disorder — to the great frustration of people like Ms. Mitchell who feel they are afflicted with it.For more fitness food and wellness news “like” our Facebook page.

1,It’s nice when a boss can have a sense of humor especially when he is the president of the United States.George Bush understood that.Long before Mr. Bush flaunted his personality with eye-catching socks or celebrated milestone birthdays by sky diving he showed off his lighter side when he secretly invited Dana Carvey the comedian who impersonated him on “Saturday Night Live” to take the stage at the White House.The exchange which was captured on video is an endearing moment in what became a yearslong friendship between Mr. Bush who died on Friday at 94 and the man who parodied him.It was December 1992 and Mr. Bush who had been defeated by Bill Clinton was on his way out of the White House. He summoned his staff to the East Room for a formal Christmas greeting. But when “Hail to the Chief” began to play it was not Mr. Bush who entered the room but Mr. Carvey.

1,Since its inception FOIA has rightly been denounced as a weak and ineffective law but The Times continues to aggressively pursue documents through the statute doing what we have done repeatedly over the past 15 years: going to court to challenge the government’s refusal to release materials that the public should see. The Times has brought more FOIA suits over the last decade than any other mainstream media organization in the country.A study by the nonprofit group TRAC found that The Times had filed 31 FOIA lawsuits during the Obama years. Our peer news organizations around the country — the major newspapers wire services and broadcasters — filed 10 collectively. A subsequent TRAC study found that The Times continued to be the leading filer among media organizations over the first year and a half of the Trump administration. The Times has now filed 27 FOIA lawsuits in the Trump years. (A handful of public interest groups and newer media outlets in particular BuzzFeed and the Center for Public Integrity have also been out front in pursuing litigation.)So why do we devote so much time to trying to make a deeply flawed law work?It’s not because it’s easy. Our FOIA litigation is done in house by our now three-lawyer team with our First Amendment Fellow Al-Amyn Sumar playing the pivotal role. We have been helped in several cases by a FOIA clinic at Yale Law School. We spend hundreds of hours each year filing the suits writing briefs negotiating with government lawyers and going to court. We know better than anyone that FOIA cases are frustrating; the deck is stacked against us and the lawsuits drag on for months and years.But one part of our motivation is pretty simple: We manage to win documents. Between successful court decisions and settlements in which the agencies agree to reverse course and give us documents we regularly make a small dent in governmental secrecy.In the past year we have assisted our reporters in unlocking documents on topics ranging from gun control and herbicides to foreign lobbyists and federal land disputes in the West. In June The Times published a report about Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s efforts to include her relatives in meetings during an official trip to China in October of 2017. Emails obtained through a FOIA lawsuit showed that the trip had been canceled after ethics concerns were raised with officials in the State and Transportation Departments.

9,The Federal Government's top highway official proposed today that private businesses operate portions of the 42500-mile Interstate System charging tolls and providing money to repair decaying highways and bridges."We believe we have got to get the private sector involved in financing highway improvements that are necessary" said the official Rodney E. Slater administrator of the Federal Highway Administration in his first meeting with reporters since President Clinton appointed him in June.The proposal not yet a specific plan has the support of Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena according to a spokesman who added that the Secretary generally backed public-private partnerships in transportation.The Reagan and Bush administrations had similar goals. Critics raised concerns that such policies could lead to profiteering at the public's expense and asked why the Government could not provide services as efficiently as private industry. Total Cost Put at $290 Billion
0,THE word ''environmentalist'' does not roll easily out of Roger Ullman's mouth. He enunciates each syllable. It is a pleasant if unfamiliar way to define himself. When he says it even for the second or third time he sounds a little like a young contestant in a spelling bee.''I am still trying to get used to it'' he acknowledges.Mr. Ullman 42 with a degree from the Harvard Business School and a career spent in international investment banking including many years as a banker in the developing world left his job as a managing director of investment banking at Merrill Lynch last year.He began work at a much reduced salary for the recently created New York chapter of Environmental Entrepreneurs also known as E2 a small nationwide environmental group made up of about 400 business executives. The group begun about three years ago in Silicon Valley by Bob Epstein who co-founded the database company Sybase Inc. and two other start-ups is part of a growing movement by executives who combine a love of finance and business with environmental concerns. And with skills and connections that many environmentalists may lack they are producing results.''My credo is that economic progress and environmental progress are desirable possible and not mutually exclusive'' he said.

0,The scientists have formed a partnership with the Parsis of Bombay -- one of India's tiniest but most successful religious minorities -- to save the vultures and with them the Parsis' traditional method of disposing of their dead.The Bombay Parsi council plans to build an aviary on Malabar Hill where disease-free vultures will be bred in captivity. The central government has given its permission to proceed but the council is waiting for a go-ahead from the Maharashtra state government.Still even in the best circumstances it will be at least four years before there are enough full-grown vultures said Dinshaw Mehta a trustee of the council. He said that these days the decomposing bodies are sometimes left exposed for as long as three weeks before the tropical sun dries them out. Sometimes a foul odor drifts on the wind.And so Parsis are faced with a wrenching quandary that has stirred an emotional polarizing debate within the community: what should they do with the dead in the meantime?Some like Phiroze Bativala whose wife Dhun died last year have chosen cremation over the traditional method. He said he could not bear the thought of leaving her to the mercy of the elements for so long. ''It is most irrational and cruel to expose her to this thoughtless way of death'' said Dr. Bativala a retired dental surgeon. ''I should not expect her to be eaten by rats and little crows.''But for many Parsis in Bombay the death of the vultures is not just a threat to an ancient custom but a challenge to their distinctiveness as a people.On a stroll through the peaceful confines of Doongerwadi where bird song is more piercing than the distant roar of the city Khojeste Mistree an Oxford-educated Zoroastrian scholar reacted to the horror outsiders often feel about the Parsi way of death and explained why he is among its impassioned champions.

0,The Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska has been causing a stir in recent seasons and that's good news in an orchestral world starved for directors with something fresh and exciting to say.Last season Mr. Vanska took over the Minnesota Orchestra his first American ensemble but he has also retained the directorship of a group in Finland the Lahti Symphony Orchestra which he has directed since 1988. He has just led the Lahti players on a brief tour that began in Minneapolis on Jan. 25 and ended at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday afternoon.Mr. Vanska is a graceful conductor whose gestures seem to communicate his ideas directly and energetically. That was certainly the case in the Sibelius works that framed his program. His account of the folkloric tone poem "Pohjola's Daughter" was a study in dark gradually shifting hues. The work describes the warrior Vainamoinen undertaking several tasks to win the hand of the Maid of Pohjola but giving up after injuring himself with an ax. The performance not only rendered the work's narrative underpinning vividly but also showed off the nimbleness of the orchestra's strings and woodwinds and the robustness of its brass.Those qualities were magnified in Mr. Vanska's unusual performance of Sibelius's Second Symphony. This was a strikingly less sentimental reading than British American and Russian conductors typically give. In the introduction for example Mr. Vanska moved steadily toward the first theme avoiding the tempo fluctuations that are not without reason a strong temptation. Instead his focus at that point was on coloration and dynamics although later in the score most notably in the slow movement and in the sweeping lyrical finale he added rhythmic flexibility to his expressive arsenal.

1,Luis Olmo who became the first Puerto Rican position player in the major leagues when he made his debut with the 1943 Brooklyn Dodgers helping to create a path for the dozens of Puerto Rican ballplayers who have made a major impact on the game died on Friday in Santurce P.R. He was 97 and had been the oldest living former Dodger.His death was confirmed by a grandson Yuri Perez.Olmo who played mostly in the outfield arrived at Ebbets Field a year after Hiram Bithorn a right-handed pitcher became the first Puerto Rican major leaguer when he joined the Chicago Cubs.Cubans had appeared in the majors before Bithorn and Olmo arrived. Whatever their nationality all of the early Latino players possessed a qualification that ownership demanded: They were white.Latinos began making a significant impact in American baseball only after Jackie Robinson broke the modern major league color barrier with the 1947 Dodgers.

6,The Superintendent's announcement was made within hours after the Board of Education whose members have been critical of Dr. Gross issued a statement calling upon the Surecommendations to improve education.The one‐sentence statement said:“The Board of Education in accordance with its continually expressed desire to improve the degree of quality education in underprivileged areas has requested the Superintendent of Schools to present to the board prior to the opening of school in September 1964 a realistic and feasible plan whereby there can be assured for the future a greater number of more experienced teachers and supervisors in those schools especially requirihg the services of such staff personnel and further that to the extent feasible the implementation of such a plan commence with the opening of school in September 1964.”The board members have in the past privately criticized Dr. Gross for not exerting leadership and for failing to submit concrete plans for action.Asked whether there was any connection between the board's statement and the announcement by Dr. Gross a spokesman for the school system replied that “it was just a coincidence.”Dr. Gross later issued the following comment: “Better staffing of schools in disadvantaged areas has been a goal of the school system for a long time. It is unquestionably an urgent problem. The staff and I have been at work at it right along. The present situation calls for every possible bit of speed that can result in real and lasting improvement in the classrooms.

1,Mark Lennihan/Associated PressMorgan Stanley which has not had much joy in a rough year for Wall Street had reason to celebrate on Wednesday.As the lead underwriter on Facebook’s initial public offering the firm will reap not only millions of dollars in fees but more important the bragging rights that come with what bankers described as a once-in-a-generation event.At Facebook it had been clear for some time that Morgan Stanley would help shepherd the company to the public markets.The Wall Street firm had led the prominent I.P.O.’s of LinkedIn Groupon and Zynga. And Michael Grimes the leader of Morgan Stanley’s office in Menlo Park Calif. had steered the firm’s tech team through the dot-com bust and forged relationships with the venture capital firms that have incubated today’s tech giants.So a vexing question for Facebook executives as they prepared to go public was: What sort of role should go to Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley’s chief rival in winning I.P.O. assignments?Goldman’s reputation has taken serious hits in recent years. A series of events from a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in 2010 that accused the firm of creating a mortgage product that was intended to fail to Goldman’s handling of a $1.5 billion investment in Facebook itself last year have led to criticism of the firm.Facebook executives say people briefed on the matter weighed how the bank’s record might affect its own reputation. So while many people still expected Goldman to be the runner-up among underwriters it was JPMorgan Chase that took the No. 2 spot in the Facebook prospectus’s listing on Wednesday.It was surprising given that JPMorgan is relatively untested in leading technology I.P.O.’s but helps illustrate the firm’s rise in recent years. The bank had played a full-court press to win over Facebook with its chief executive Jamie Dimon forming a rapport with Facebook’s chief operating office Sheryl Sandberg. The bank’s top deal-maker James B. Lee Jr. meanwhile regularly led pitches to Facebook executives.One advantage was JPMorgan’s strength as a lender having helped create a credit facility that provided Facebook with ample cash.Still the banks were in the dark about whether they stood in Facebook’s good graces until a few weeks ago. Three other firms round out the underwriting syndicate so far: Bank of America–Merrill Lynch Barclays Capital and Allen & Company.In a show of support for their prospective client bankers from the top three underwriters had set up Facebook accounts despite firm policies banning the use of social networks at the office.“This is a great thing for people’s tech practices” Peter Falvey a managing director at Morgan Keegan said. “It’s such a unique asset and such a highly anticipated offering that it has significant franchise value.”Such is Facebook’s prominence that banks are willing to work for a much lower fee than usual. The company is expected to pay its advisers a fee as low as 1 percent of proceeds raised according to a person briefed on the matter. That would be far below the norm of 3 to 7 percent though the size of Facebook’s offering guarantees a still-handsome payout.That low fee is reminiscent of what General Motors paid in its “re-I.P.O.” in the fall of 2010: an eye-popping 0.75 percent. There however the selling shareholder was the federal government.With an expected valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion Facebook will be among the biggest companies to seek the public markets in recent memory. Recent trades on Sharespost a secondary market for Facebook stock valued the company at as much as $89 billion.Even with a fund-raising target of $5 billion — a preliminary figure that will almost surely grow over time — Facebook’s offering is more than twice as big as Google’s $1.9 billion initial offering nearly eight years ago.The road to landing a coveted underwriting role began years ago according to people briefed on the matter. It meant forming relationships with Facebook’s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg who viewed Wall Street bankers with some skepticism.It also meant winning over top executives like Ms. Sandberg and Facebook’s finance chief David Ebersman who would oversee the I.P.O. process. Bankers also courted influential Facebook investors like James W. Breyer of Accel Partners and Yuri Milner of DST Global.Bankers and analysts had long assumed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the front-runners. Together the two firms underwrote nearly 14 percent of I.P.O.’s worldwide last year raising $22.3 billion in proceeds for their clients according to data from Thomson Reuters. Goldman ranked first with 54 offerings that raised $11.9 billion.Yet within Silicon Valley Morgan Stanley has a nearly matchless reputation. In making their pitch to Facebook to be lead underwriter Morgan Stanley bankers promoted their firm’s ability to sell huge amounts of stock through its retail brokerage network — an ability that appealed to Facebook according to a person briefed on the matter.Goldman had its own cards to play having also worked on Groupon and Zynga. It also led a $500 million investment in Facebook last year and sold an additional $1 billion worth of stock to wealthy foreign private clients. But the latter led to embarrassing questions about potential securities regulation violations hamstringing Goldman’s efforts.Evelyn M. Rusli contributed reporting.

0,In a culture of silence words can be weapons. In perhaps no contemporary state has the written word proved more threatening than in Saudi Arabia where sins sources of shame and sometimes even accomplishments tend to be hidden away.So it was with a determined lack of fanfare nearly a decade ago that Prince Khaled bin Sultan the Saudi media baron and former co-commander of the military coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war opened a front in the cultural war against silence in his country even as he prepared to lead the multinational forces into battle to free Kuwait.In September 1990 the prince quietly agreed to finance an ambitious project by a group of Saudi scholars to document the country's rich cultural heritage and traditions before they disappeared. Ten years and several million dollars later the Encyclopedia of Folklore of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a 12-volume Arabic-language compendium of a vanishing way of life has just been printed in Belgium. Its authors say that the series which includes 5000 drawings illustrations and graphs is the largest body of secular scholarship ever produced in Saudi Arabia. It includes separate volumes on topics like historical and archaeological sites traditional medicine geography even children's games. And there is an entire volume devoted to the camel.While Prince Khaled said he had contemplated such a project for two years before the gulf war the conflict was the project's main catalyst. ''The widespread ignorance of Saudi Arabia and its cultural heritage not just among foreigners but among younger Saudis made me determined to try and document and preserve our traditions before it was too late'' he said in a telephone interview.

0,To the Editor:Re ''A Global Warning to Mr. Bush'' (editorial Feb. 26):Not only does President Bush not seem to be interested or even aware of the real possibility of international calamities arising from global warming he also seems inclined to foreclose on learning more about this phenomenon by cutting back on scientific research.In the midst of talk about trillions of dollars of surpluses a minuscule increase -- in effect a decrease -- in financing for the National Science Foundation one of the major sources of research on global climate change is tantamount to hiding one's head in the sand.Stifling research on global warming will not make the phenomenon go away; it will just enable us to prolong our ignorance about it.PIERRE E.

8,Eastern Air Lines Inc. reeling from an industrywide fare war reported yesterday a second-quarter loss of $44 million compared with a profit of $25.5 million or 37 cents a share for the corresponding period a year ago.Eastern's revenues declined 15.4 percent to $1.1 billion from $1.3 billion.Wall Street had been expecting bad news from Eastern whose chairman Frank Borman resigned on June 30.Joseph B. Leonard Eastern's president attributed its poor performance to the combination of industry fare discounting and remaining fallout from union threats against the company earlier in the year. Meanwhile the Texas AirCorporation which had agreed to buy Eastern in a $676 million deal that is pending before the Transportation Department reported that it had a second-quarter loss of $44.8 million compared with net income of $41 million or $2.69 a share a year ago.

8,ROBERT CHESLEY'S two-character drama ''Jerker or the Helping Hand'' is a cry of anguished solidarity from the heart of San Francisco's homosexual world a segment of society where the AIDS epidemic has taken an especially devastating toll.The play consists of 20 telephone calls between J.R. (Jay Corcoran) and Bert (John Finch) strangers whose anonymous telephone-sex relationship turns into a morale-boosting dialogue on homosexual pride. Conversations that begin as intricate kinky safe-sex fantasies change in mood and quality as rough ''playtime'' stories metamorphose into tender ''bedtime'' stories that look back nostalgically to the 1970's.''Jerker'' accurately bills itself as ''a pornographic elegy with redeeming social value'' and its gamy language and simulated autoeroticism are definitely not for squeamish tastes. But they serve a poignant purpose by pointing out more bluntly than any other play dealing with acquired immune deficiency syndrome how the epidemic has threatened one of the fundamental reasons for an entire group's very existence - its freedom of erotic expression - and challenged its hard-won self-esteem. Over the course of the drama we learn that J.R. is a paraplegic Vietnam veteran. And in a stridently angry and simplistic diatribe he contrasts the evil morality of war to the ''really truly basically good'' promiscuous way of life that the epidemic has cut short.The play's staging underscores the protagonists' isolation vulnerability and fear as the two men each lying nude on a bed on opposite sides of the stage connect by telephone and by Bert's telephone answering machine which toward the end of the drama becomes a harbinger of doom.
0,Governor Eliot Spitzer signed five executive orders in his first morning as governor of New York including orders establishing a number of ethical guidelines for state workers and making the government more open to the public.During a signing ceremony at about 8:45 a.m. at the executive mansion Mr. Spitzer said he was fulfilling a promise “that one of the first acts I would take as governor officially was to put in place a series of ethics guidelines and strictures that would begin the process of restoring government to what it should be which is responsive open transparent available to the public and to the extent feasible insulated from the influence of improper gifts and contributions.”“I am hoping that others in other branches will join me in this” he added.He signed the orders on a desk once used by Theodore Roosevelt in a room of the mansion known as “the History Room” which also includes a wheelchair used by Franklin Roosevelt. After Mr. Spitzer finished signing the orders and had answered some questions he strode out of the room but he and his wife Silda were drawn back in after his dogs Jesse (Bichon Frisé) and James (Wheaten Terrier) bolted in and began barking at members of the news media.Asked how much sleep he had gotten Mr. Spitzer said “probably not enough.”“I think I came upstairs from downstairs at about 12:30 probably went to sleep at about 1 but I will admit that about 4:30 combination of wondering what the weather was going to be this morning I started getting up to peer out the window.”Mr. Spitzer’s first executive order prohibited state workers at public agencies and authorities from accepting gifts or more than nominal value and prohibited the use of state property including vehicles computers and telephones for non-official business. And in what seemed to be a reference to the scandal that led to the resignation of former Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi the order said that individuals authorized by their agency to use a vehicle for personal purposes “shall keep records of such use and the value of such personal use shall be calculated and reported as personal income.”The same order also prohibited nepotism in hiring and contracting and barred former state workers from lobbying their former agency for two years.The second order prohibited state workers from donating money to the campaigns of the governor or lieutenant governor or affiliated political action committees.“I do not believe it looks proper for individuals who work for the governor the lieutenant governor to be making contributions” he said adding “the appearance might be that they have been expected to do so or it is a condition of employment. None of that should exist.”The order also barred employment officials from asking job candidates about their party affiliation and barred state officials from appearing in advertisements paid for by state entities a frequent practice of former Gov. George E. Pataki. The order also prohibited commissioners and executive directors of agencies and public authorities from running for public office without first resigning.In a third order the governor said all state agencies and authorities must come up with a plan to broadcast their meetings on the Internet if they are subject to the state’s Open Meetings Law.“It may be that nobody clicks through and watches but at least the possibility of watching what these boards do and how they meet and how they discuss the issues is important” Mr. Spitzer said.A fourth order established judicial screening committees to evaluate and recommend judicial candidates for a range of judgeships across the state.A fifth order which Mr. Spitzer described as “ministerial” continued a number of executive orders from the Cuomo and Pataki administrations.As his dogs bounded around the room the governor was asked if he would let them eat any of the new official paperwork.“If it’s tasty” he replied “why not?”

0,The most astonishing auction ever produced went like this around the table: one diamond three diamonds five diamonds six diamonds seven diamonds double redouble and all pass. This occurred in a London club 70 years ago and when the dummy appeared light dawned. The players were using a new deck that had two diamond suits and no heart suit. Remarkably the deal had not produced any duplicated spot cards to alert the players that something was wrong with the deck.Another diamond-studded auction occurred on the diagramed deal from the Flight A Regional Swiss Teams in Smithtown N.Y. in February. This time the deck was entirely correct. South was Arnold Rosner of Brooklyn and he opened one diamond. Dorothy Tourance also of Brooklyn sitting West bid two diamonds which was the Michaels convention promising at least 5-5 in the major suits.North was Rosanne Schabinger of Mount Prospect Ill. and she contributed a natural raise to three diamonds. This was the equivalent of a single raise since a stronger hand with a diamond fit would have made a cue-bid in a major suit. Lillian Weissman of Long Beach N.Y. was East and having a promising hand in support of the majors she cue-bid four diamonds asking her partner to select a suit. West would have had to guess which suit to try and would have been wise as it happens to choose spades. Four spades would make nine tricks but four hearts could be held to eight with a spade ruff.This did not happen because naturally South bid five diamonds completing the cycle of diamond bids. This ended the auction and West led the spade king. Dummy's ace won the trick and a diamond was led. East won with the ace and returned a spade which was ruffed.

9,To the Editor:Iran did not as you state in "Iran Resurgent" (editorial Nov. 16) "seize" a strategic Persian Gulf island in September. Iran has partly controlled the island Abu Musa since 1971 under a settlement of gulf territorial disputes by Iran Britain and the then new United Arab Emirates.That settlement included: (a) Iran's relinquishing of its claim to Bahrain with recognition of Bahrain's independence; (b) creation of the United Arab Emirates and its recognition by Iran; (c) repossession of the Tambs Islands by Iran and (d) establishment of an Iran-Sharjah condominium over Abu Musa.All other major powers and most Arab governments acquiesced in the arrangement. The brewing controversy in the Persian Gulf threatens to unravel this settlement in its entirety; bloodshed cannot be far behind.Moreover Iran's aggressiveness is not as you suggest fueled by the lack of restrictions in obtaining sophisticated "dual-use" technologies. On the contrary the resurgence of radicalism in Iranian foreign policy is the effect of frustration with the Bush Administration's unfulfilled promises. President Bush said in his inauguration speech Jan. 20 1989 that if Iran cooperated in repatriation of hostages he would reciprocate by offering an olive branch. Through the good offices of President Hashemi Rafsanjani the last United States hostage was repatriated this year; Iran gained nothing in return -- not even an olive branch.

8,The President of a delicately balanced country critical to the United States is killed. His top military officers die with him; so do the Ambassador and the military attache of the United States.There is at the very least the strong suspicion that they were murdered and political logic indicates that the murder was committed by the same foreigners who had been threatening the President for years. This month there will be an election to replace him.Whatever happens in the country will affect the peace of a continent and the conflicting security interests of the United States and the Soviet Union. Altogether it is one of the most dramatic and important episodes taking place in the world.The American public pays no attention. Journalistically the death of President Zia of Pakistan and the 29 others who were aboard his plane when it crashed in Pakistani territory on Aug. 27 - and its consequences -would have disappeared except for the persistence of a few reporters like Elaine Sciolino of The New York Times and Lally Weymouth of The Washington Post.

Her superchic personal style has been touted by fashion heavyweights like her current boss Raf Simons as well as her former employer Marc Jacobs who has called her his muse. Each piece in Miceli’s prefall collection for Dior has the ability to single-handedly pull an outfit together.

0,It was mighty quiet at the Coffee Station on Wednesday.Too quiet especially for the townspeople and tourists who lined up along the walls inside what is Crawford's only diner for a glimpse of the town's most famous resident who usually comes for a cheeseburger to ring out the old year.This year President Bush was a no-show.Maybe it was Code Orange. Or maybe Mr. Bush who has not been seen in public since he arrived here Friday and headed into his 1600-acre ranch did not want to answer questions about mad cows his attorney general or his New Year's resolutions. Whatever the reason a president who was remarkably chatty this time last year -- taking reporters on a brisk hike and answering questions about North Korea and Saddam Hussein in the diner's parking lot -- was nowhere to be seen.The disappointment was palpable inside the Coffee Station which like Iraq is under new management since Mr. Bush's last New Year's visit. Doug Cheatham a Texan who moved to Connecticut years ago brought his wife Zora and other family members well before noon. They scanned the crowd looking for tell-tale signs including Secret Service agents. There were a few -- but they were coming for lunch without their protectee.Diners had to sign up for a table. Words rarely spoken inside -- ''Brown table of two we're ready for you'' -- were shouted above the din as scores hoped to score a table next to the president's.

Those words apparently have a double meaning.Last night Manhattan proved to St. Peter's College that Draddy Gymnasium is very sweet by routing the Peacocks 73-54 before 1021 fans.Six of Manhattan's seven victories this season have been at home and their .877 winning percentage there ranks them first in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and 14th in the nation.''I'm not sure what it is'' Leonard said of Draddy Gymnasium the court where he played from 1978-1982 as a guard for the Jaspers. ''It's a tough place for other teams to play. I don't think that it is as much a confidence thing as it is an attitude thing for us when we play here.''

8,The Better World Society a Washington-based group founded last year by Ted Turner to use television to explore the issues of environment population and nuclear arms control. is working with the British Broadcasting Corporation to produce a 12-part television series ''Only One Earth.''The series will be aired initially next spring on the Cable News Network and negotiations for presenting it on the Public Broadcasting Service are in progress.All production costs for the $400000 project have been subscribed and further funds are being raised for an accompanying color paperback and package of educational materials. The television series will be timed to reinforce the 1987 final report of the World Commission on Environment and Development which was chartered by the United Nations.
9,Kentucky should be happier to have him. He is gracious he is gentlemanly and he is the man you want coaching your son. He has actually coached both of his sons G. G. at Georgia and Saul at Kentucky and Cameron Mills was one of several players who called him a father figure. Anyone call Rupp that and mean it? Even some of Pitino's former players conceded he cared about little besides their basketball skills.Tubby Smith has always been his own man.''Ever since he was first hired there was all that hype about him being the first black coach at Kentucky'' Mills said. ''There was all the pressure he endured for himself and the fans after the losses when people said he wasn't Rick Pitino. Well he's not Rick Pitino. He's Tubby Smith. And they both have a national title.''Jeff Sheppard the closest player to a star that Smith had in a program that has lost five first-round draft picks in the last two seasons said ''He does a really good job of teaching us basketball but even a better job of teaching us how to be men.''One of the more irritating aspects of college basketball is that the coaches often receive too much attention. Not to add to that but Smith deserved a bundle of praise for helping the Wildcats erase a 10-point deficit the largest overcome during a title game to enable Kentucky to win the school's seventh national championship. The comeback might have satisfied even the fan who talked about the Wildcats then 21-3 on a Feb. 11 radio show by saying ''I haven't given up on them yet.''That sounded ludicrous then and more so now. Under Smith this team obliterated a 17-point deficit in the final nine minutes against Duke in the South Regional and rallied from 10 points back to beat Stanford in the national semifinals. In the title game Smith made three clever adjustments and substituted like a savant after Utah's man-to-man steered it to a 41-31 lead at the half.

0,Michel Euler/Associated Press Michel Euler/Associated Press Marina Zenovich the director of the HBO documentary “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired” said Thursday that she was “perplexed by the timing” of remarks by David Wells a former deputy district attorney who said in her film that he had coached the judge presiding over Mr. Polanski’s 1978 trial but who now says he made it all up.In a statement Ms. Zenovich said that since June of 2008 her film “has been quite visible on U.S. television via HBO in theaters and on DVD so it is odd that David Wells has not brought this issue to my attention before.”She added:“For the record on the day I filmed Mr. Wells at the Malibu Courthouse February 11 2005 he gave me a one-hour interview. He signed a release like all my other interviewees giving me permission to use his interview in the documentary worldwide. At no time did I tell him that the film would not air in the United States. “Mr. Wells was always friendly and open with me. At no point in the four years since our interview has he ever raised any issues about its content. In fact in a July 2008 story in The New York Times Mr. Wells corroborated the account of events that he gave in my film. “I am astonished that he has now changed his story. It is a sad day for documentary filmmakers when something like this happens.”More on Roman Polanski.

9,"A form of complacency we seem to be looking at here is a crew's loss of the big picture sometimes called situation awareness" said C. O. Miller an internationally respected safety consultant. "Loss of awareness is too often compounded by excessive dependence on these automated systems especially when there is only a short time to act."Here is how the airliner would normally have been operated on its trip and what initial analysis of flight-recorder data indicates led to the disaster:Before takeoff from Miami the flight management computer was programmed to guide the plane on a standard route taking it past a succession of radio-navigation stations or fixes on the ground. The computer system would automatically tune in successive stations. The plane's automatic pilot would steer the plane either directly over stations or off to one side at specified distances or over the intersection of signals from two stations.The pilots' role was to use radios and dashboard instruments to verify that the automatic system was taking them where it was supposed to. They also would radio controllers keeping them updated on the plane's location.The primary ground stations are known as V.O.R.'s for "very high frequency omnidirectional range station." These send out radio signals so a crew will know the precise direction from their plane to the station. More advanced stations also have distance-measuring equipment that shows on a cockpit instrument the miles from plane to station.The flight on a clear but moonless night seemed problem-free until the southbound plane neared the V.O.R. station named Tulua.Controllers at Cali had cleared the pilots to fly to the Cali V.O.R. just south of the airport where radar destroyed by guerrillas had never been replaced. The pilots were to report passing Tulua and to keep to an altitude of 15000 feet. That was vital because the assigned route went down a valley between treacherous Andes peaks.The pilots never did report reaching Tulua and the station appears to be a fateful link in the events that led to the crash. Two minutes after the pilots acknowledged that they would report at Tulua controllers radioed that the wind at Cali was calm and asked the crew if they could land from the north.
9,Tonight Israel had further cause for rejoicing when it won a second medal in judo this one a bronze that went to Shay Oren Smadga in the men's lightweight division (156 1/2 pounds).While the Munich killings had a devastating impact on the sports world it is generally not dwelt upon by most Israelis who have since endured countless other terrorist raids and several wars that form important parts of the national fabric. As it turned out Arad's performance was the sweet close to what had been yet another blood-soaked day in Israel one in which 2 people were killed and nearly 50 others injured in an explosion at a munitions plant and in which several hours later a Jerusalem policeman was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant who in turn was shot and killed.There were evocations of Munich recently when Yediot Ahronot citing classified documents reportedly obtained from the Bavaria state prosecutor's office stated that at least eight of the Israeli athletes were killed not by their Palestinian kidnappers but by German police officers during a rescue attempt.The Bavarian Justice Minister Mathilde Berghofer-Weichner responded by saying the official investigations had concluded that none of the Israelis died from police fire and denied knowledge of any contrary evidence.But instead of Munich and its painful memories most Israelis preferred today to focus on Yael Arad and her moment of glory (although a few people could not hide their glee over the fact that she had defeated a German to reach the finals).Arad one of five children in a family from Herzliya on the Mediterranean coast just north of Tel Aviv has been the standout of a 31-member Israeli team that has thus far failed to dazzle.She took up judo at the age of 8 and says that since completing her compulsory army service five years ago she has dedicated herself almost exclusively to the sport including annual trips to Japan for training sessions. Last year she finished third in the European judo championship.
8,The Daisy Systems Corporation began a tender offer at $8 a share in cash to acquire control of the Cadnetix Corporation. Daisy a maker of computer-aided engineering systems based in Mountain View Calif. already holds 7.6 percent of Cadnetix a Boulder. Colo. company that makes similar systems. Daisy's offer is for 11.7 million shares which would give it 51 percent of Cadnetix.Daisy said it was willing to amend the offer to purchase all of Cadnetix's outstanding shares of common stock at $8 a share in cash if Cadnetix's board supported the deal. Daisy said the offer follows attempts last spring and again this week to discuss a possible merger with Cadnetix.Norman Friedman Daisy's president and chief executive said in a statement that Cadnetix's strength in computer-aided design systems for printed circuit board development would fit well with Daisy's strength in integrated circuit design and system simulation.

7,WESTBURY L. I. June 2 —Carmine Abbatiello is the world's best harness racing driver—according to Car mine Abbatiello.The 34‐year‐old horseman from Colt's Neck N. J. where he owns a 45‐acre spread and raises cattle chickens and standardbreds will not hesitate to tell any one that “if I had the stock that Billy Haughton Stanley Dancer George Sholty and some of the other ‘name’ drivers have I'd convince everyone of my greatness.”Most of Abbatiello's col leagues learned long ago that when Carmine “pops off” it is not to be regarded as braggadocio. In fact the ma jority of reinsmen are quite friendly with him and are most respectful to Carmine who currently is the leading driver in North America. His older brother Tony is also an outstanding driver.Must Get Rolling NowThe other drivers often are amused by Carmine's self proclaimed superiority and always are happy to be in his company. At the moment though Carmine is not alto gether happy with himself. He is behind the schedule he set for himself at the start of the campaign when he pre dicted:“This year I will become the first American driver to bring home 400 winners.”Herve Filion of Angers Quebec had 407 winners in 1968.

8,The new American approach would set equal limits on the number of tanks and artillery pieces. The limit would be set at current NATO levels. Some Administration officials said the United States might agree to a proposal that set limits at slightly below NATO levels as West German officials have said to have suggested.If a limit is set at current NATO levels the Warsaw Pact would be required to reduce its force of tanks from about 48000 to about 20000. On artillery pieces the Warsaw Pact would have to reduce the number of its weapons from about 36000 to about 15000.Some Administration officials said the American approach might be expanded in light of the ongoing consultations to include an additional limit on the number of weapons in the central part of Europe. This could be done by setting a limit on non-indigenous forces stationed on the territory of European nations such as Soviet tanks in East Germany and American tanks in West Germany. No Limits on AircraftNo limits would be sought on tactical aircraft an area where NATO has a technological advantage over the Warsaw Pact.Administration officials argued that limits on aircraft are unacceptable because aircraft are ''dual capable'' systems that can carry nuclear-tipped missiles and bombs. NATO has steadfastly refused to include the tactical nuclear weapons in the the talks on conventional arms. The officials also asserted that limits on aircraft would be very hard to verify.But the Soviet Union is expected to seek limits on aircraft and has talked publicly about the need to include tactical nuclear weapons in the new talks.American officials said that there were some differences within the alliance over how to proceed in the talks. West German officials are said to have expressed a concern that a new agreement lead to some reductions on the Western side because West Germany has a declining birth rate and may have to reduce the size of its forces anyway.
1,How We Got Here
9,The divided people of Korea have good reason to celebrate the old year along with the new. The withdrawal of all U.S. nuclear arms from South Korea made the peninsula nuclear-free. Now a potentially far-reaching agreement between the Governments of the South and the North could keep it that way.Yesterday's accord reaffirms the commitment of the two Governments undertaken in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty not to acquire nuclear arms. And it goes two critical steps further: It commits North Korea not to construct facilities for reprocessing nuclear material and it opens the way to on-site inspection by the South of a suspect facility in the North.The agreement thus provides a script for defusing nuclear fears on the peninsula. One: Washington assures Pyongyang that it has indeed withdrawn all nuclear arms from the peninsula and resumes pulling out troops. Two: Pyongyang signs the safeguards accord that allows access by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Three: Seoul calls off Team Spirit the joint military exercises it conducts annually with the U.S.And then most important of all Pyongyang faithfully implements the key provisions of yesterday's accord by accepting inspection of its suspected reprocessing plant at Yongbyon -- and if necessary by halting construction. These steps will speed the reconciliation of North and South help create ties between the U.S. and North Korea and assure a peaceful new year for all Koreans.
9,The two-and-a-half-hour play is performed on Saturdays and Sundays (except Easter Sunday) at 2:30 P.M. Tickets are $20; $12.50 for children. Slices of homemade cake are available for $1 at intermission.Parking is difficult but there is a municipal lot behind the theater from 35th to 38th Street. The No. 127 bus from the Port Authority in Manhattan stops at 32d Street; the exact-change fare is $1.90 each way and the trip takes about 15 minutes. (Make sure you're on the right bus; there are many marked "Union City.") On the way back to Manhattan we rode on the bus with King Herod and St. Peter in street clothes. Easter Egg Hunt and Rolling Contest Central Park North Meadow Ballfield No. 9 Enter at 100th Street and Central Park West or 97th Street and Fifth Avenue (800) 201-7275 Recommended ages: 3 to 12 TomorrowLast year Bruce Cannon a puppeteer at the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater in Central Park was the bunny who presides over this annual contest. This year he's not. "I got chased around a lot last year" Mr. Cannon said. "Particularly by the girls." Which wasn't so terrible he admitted but it was exhausting.It's that time when about 600 children representing a healthy cross section of New York City compete with one another as they trample the North Meadow which is as brown as cowhide right now. At least the plastic eggs for the hunt add color. (The 2000 eggs will be hidden at 8 A.M. tomorrow by New York City Parks and Recreation employees.) The hunt for 3- and 4-year-olds only please is at 11 A.M. but you must register by 10 A.M.At the egg roll 5-to-12-year-olds use spoons to roll wooden eggs along marked lines to the finish which may sound easy but it's not. Participants must register by 11 A.M. for the noon event.

9,John Smart a retired New York publisher philanthropist and former chairman of Esquire Inc. died on Monday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. A resident of Greenwich he was 88.The cause was complications following a stroke his family said.In recent years Mr. Smart devoted much of his time to the philanthropic activities of the Smart Family Foundation based in Greenwich. The foundation had assets of close to $50 million in 1990. It chiefly supports education focusing on projects that aid primary and secondary schoolchildren. Mr. Smart also supported Jewish philanthropy and a number of projects in Israel.Mr. Smart and his two older brothers David and Alfred founded Apparel Arts a trade publication in 1931. That was followed two years later by Esquire magazine.After his brothers died in the early 1950's Mr. Smart took charge of the organization. He stabilized Esquire and converted Apparel Arts into the more successful Gentlemen's Quarterly. The parent company was Esquire Inc. which also produced educational materials and textbooks.
9,TARRYTOWN N.Y.— If you have a child of a certain age say old enough to need a dictionary but not old enough to go out and buy it herself -- the big news out of Ann Arbor Mich. a few weeks ago was no news at all. According to a University of Michigan study children have a lot less free time than they used to. You could have produced the same data from your kitchen table where you preside over one of the chief culprits identified in the study: endless homework.Gone are the early easy years when your child gathered autumn leaves for show and tell and still had time to work a jigsaw puzzle before bedtime. Gone too are the days of your youth when homework was something children did by themselves no questions asked. Your 9-year-old needs your help.She must coax 20 spelling words per week into scintillating sentences. She has to master three-digit multiplication and long division pronto. She's up until nearly 11 P.M. at least once a week fashioning a wigwam out of an old leather slipper or searching for algae in filthy water scooped from a backyard puddle.Any of these assignments alone might be manageable but the message seems to be volume volume volume. Once you pile on music lessons organized sports and household chores you have the stressed-out specimen observed in the Michigan study.

0,Today’s qualifying session for the Brazilian Grand Prix went pretty much as predicted with one exception: Jarno Trulli.How big an influence will the Italian’s unexpected position in second place on the grid have on the result of the world championship battle tomorrow?It was expected that the Ferraris would likely make it to the top two spots. It was expected that the McLaren Mercedes would be in third and fourth with Lewis Hamilton ahead of his teammate Heikki Kovalainen and those two did perform in that manner – but with Trulli landing in between the two contending teams.Trulli on Thursday had a 39 degree temperature and flu. He stayed in his hotel and received treatment from the Toyota team doctor that brought him back into a condition to drive a perfect lap. But how will he behave in tomorrow’s race? Trulli has never been the best of drivers in a crowd. It was only one race ago in China that he and Sebastien Bourdais had a coming together at the start. If they all go into side by side to that tight left hand first corner what might happen?“I race for myself and I race for my team and I race for points” said Trulli in the post qualifying press conference. “From experience I know that I don

8,Orlando Pizzolato has become a minor celebrity the kind only a few people recognize.He arrived in New York Sunday for a week of promotional work for the Oct. 27 New York City Marathon which he won last year. Sunday night he ran in Central Park and if anyone's head turned when he passed he didn't notice it.''Nobody knows who I am'' he said yesterday. ''Nobody knows my face here. In Italy my name is famous. I like it when people come up to me and talk and take pictures and ask for my autograph. It hasn't happened enough to me not to like it.''It almost happened last week in Italy where Pizzolato ran in a series of races much like cycling's Tour de France. Everyone seemed to want to take his picture or get his autograph or have coffee with him. He wanted to run and train. He compromised - many pictures too much coffee and enough running to fill his needs.This will be his fourth New York City Marathon. In 1982 and 1983 his trips were financed by Champion the sportswear company that sponsors his club team. In 1982 he dropped out after 15 miles his legs as limp as spaghetti because this was his third marathon in five weeks. In 1983 he finished 27th high enough for the marathon sponsors to pay his expenses to the 1984 race.

9,To the Editor:In ''The Picture of Bill Clinton'' (editorial Aug. 23) you state that President Clinton has not harmed respect for the Presidency because Presidents Ford Carter and Reagan had demonstrated that even the failures of Richard Nixon had not done permanent damage to the office of the President. Very obviously omitted from that list of Presidents since Nixon was President Bush.George Bush brought honor dignity and respect to the office of the Presidency in the eyes of the American people and the world at large. I believe you owe your readers an apology and a correction for an editorial that has a glaring omission and could create an erroneous impression.BRENT SCOWCROFTWashington Aug. 26 1998
8,The Who's 25th anniversary tour which came to Giants Stadium on Thursday might be called ''the Who cash in'' as the reunited band reprises its songs for a summer's work projected to bring in about $30 million. Thursday's concert was mammoth in every way - in attendance (54000 for the first of four nights) in the size of the band (15 members) and in length (more than three hours of music).The crowd would probably have been pleased with a run-through of greatest hits. But in an unpredictable program that included hits a sizable part of the rock opera ''Tommy'' and a selection of cover versions and material from band members' solo albums the Who was both generous and almost vulnerable. The band revealed itself not just as earth-shaking stadium-rockers - though there are few experiences in rock to compare with hearing ''Won't Get Fooled Again'' as tens of thousands of arms wave and voices sing along - but as eccentric even playful rock elder statesmen jumping around the stage.The original Who members - the singer Roger Daltrey the guitarist-songwriter Pete Townshend and the bassist John Entwistle - played ''Magic Bus'' and ''Mary-Anne With the Shaky Hands'' on their own. Otherwise the sound was filled out by Simon Phillips on drums (replacing the late Keith Moon) and auxiliary guitar keyboards percussion horns and singers not all of whom were strictly necessary.The band members' solo features implied perhaps misleadingly each one's contributions to the Who - Mr. Entwistle's brute-force rock Mr. Townshend's earnest pop and Mr. Daltrey's fondness for the blues. But choices outside the Who's catalogue were often embarrassing; instead of others' material the Who might have revived songs that aren't on its greatest-hits albums. For its encore the Who proudly declared itself a 1960's band with ''Barefootin''' ''Hey Joe'' and the Beatles' arrangement of ''Twist and Shout.''

9,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students examine the significance of the August 30 1999 vote in East Timor which will determine the territory’s independence or autonomy from Indonesian rule. Students analyze a New York Times article about the vote to understand the actions and reactions of the East Timorese citizens the Indonesian and East Timorese governments the United Nations and separatist groups in East Timor in this crucial vote in Southeast Asia.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes- 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Compare independence and autonomy when referring to a country’s political status; understand the history of East Timor’s struggle for independence under Indonesian rule.2. Examine the significance of the August 30 1999 vote in East Timor in relation to the history of the territory by reading and discussing “In Huge Model Vote East Timorese Choose Their Future.”3. Analyze in small groups the actions of East Timorese citizens the Indonesian government the East Timorese government the United Nations and separatist groups in East Timor as described in the featured article as well as their reactions to one another.4. Display and present their assigned group’s actions and reactions as described in the article in whatever way they choose; continue this analysis exercise as vote results are confirmed and once the results are enacted by using other newspaper articles from The New York Times or other sources.Resources / Materials:-student journals-paper-pens/pencils-classroom blackboard-copies of “In Huge Model Vote East Timorese Choose Their Future” (one per student)-five pieces of white poster board-assortment of colored markersActivities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): What does “independence” mean when referring to the status of a country? What is the country free to do when it is “independent”? What is the difference between independence and autonomy? Students then share their answers. Help students more accurately define the difference between independence and autonomy if necessary. Then provide students a brief history of East Timor and its struggle for independence from Indonesian rule (such as that provided in the Background section of this lesson).2. As a class read and discuss “In Huge Model Vote East Timorese Choose Their Future” focusing on the following questions:a. What words are used to describe the voters in East Timor and why might Seth Mydans have chosen these words?b. Why does the first paragraph include that “the conduct of the vote… was just about as good as it could be”? What elements of the past and present history of East Timor are reflected in this statement?c. Who currently controls East Timor and what is the name of their leader? What offer did he make on Monday to East Timor regarding this vote?d. On what did voters vote?e. What history of East Timor’s rule is discussed in the article? Why is this history important in understanding the significance of this vote?f. Why do you think so many people turned out to vote?g. What groups threaten the welfare of the East Timorese and why? How do these groups fit into understanding this historic vote?h. What East Timorese government groups are mentioned in the article and what role did they play in the vote?i. What does the Jakarta official quoted in the article mean when he says “the military has been pretty unscrupulous about pushing for the pro-autonomy forces to win. But it’s looking like they may be prepared to accept a loss and go on to the other problems of which they have plenty”? What other discussion is there in the article of the influence and reactions of the Indonesian government in East Timor and in this vote? What changes are currently occurring in Indonesia?j. Many East Timorese citizens are quoted in the article. How might their statements reflect the tumultuous history of East Timor and the possible effects of independence from Indonesian rule?k. What role does the United Nations play in this vote?l. What will happen if the East Timorese vote results in the territory’s independence?3. Divide students into five groups and assign each group one of the following organizations or groups of people affected directly by the status of East Timor: East Timorese citizens Indonesian government East Timorese government the United Nations separatist groups in East Timor. Explain to students that they will be examining newspaper articles following the events and effects of the vote in East Timor focusing on the actions of the assigned group and their reactions to the other four groups (as much as available in the article). Students then skim the article in their small groups noting the specific information given about and by their assigned group of people involved in this historic vote. When taking notes students should be sure to separate notes by actions and reactions to each of the other groups. In other words the “East Timorese citizens” group not only notes the citizens’ actions as described in the article but also how the citizens are reacting to the Indonesian government East Timorese government the United Nations and the separatist groups.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Give each small group a piece of poster board and some markers. Each group then displays their assigned group’s actions and reactions as described in the article in whatever way they choose (timeline format concept map outline etc.). At the beginning of the next class each group should present their poster and discuss why the different groups involved in the vote are acting and reacting in such ways. In future classes bring in other articles about the vote in East Timor from The New York Times or other sources for students to analyze in these groups as described in parts 3 and 4 of this lesson.Further Questions for Discussion:–What other countries are in the same region of the world as East Timor and how might they be affected by the recent vote there?–What comparisons can be made between East Timor and other historical events with respect to colonization and military occupation?–What is the history of military occupation in East Timor?–Why would a territory want to seek independence from another country? Why might the territory want to seek autonomy from that country?–What are the possible results both positive and negative of the independence of East Timor from Indonesian rule?–What are the pros and cons of military occupation of colonized territories such as East Timor?–What freedoms do you feel should be allowed to all humans regardless of where they lie? Why is it so difficult to enforce these freedoms on an international level?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal responses participation in class discussions and ongoing evaluation of newspaper articles tracing the results of the vote in East Timor.Vocabulary:optimistic referendum militias momentum autonomous status separatist insurgency diplomat subdue unscrupulous disarray debilitating assembly formality rampage threadbare interim expertise cedeExtension Activities:1. Diagram the electoral and voting processes in East Timor and Indonesia as well as in other countries. Then compare your diagrams. In what countries are elections most free in terms of the ability to run for office choose elected officials and decide upon important laws? Where are there still restrictions on running for office and on voting?2. Examine the issue of human rights in Indonesia and East Timor as well as in other nations in that region of the world. What human rights issues have been and are being raised and why? What is being done to stop violation of human rights in this region and by whom? Create a “Bill of Human Rights” that you feel should be decreed in that region as well as worldwide.3. Learn about East Timor’s relationship with Indonesia and examine how the recent elections in Indonesia (June 1999) have affected and might continue to affect East Timor.4. Several of the East Timorese citizens quoted in the article discuss national pride. What fosters national pride and how is this pride manifested?5. Research colonialism as practiced by European countries (particularly Portugal) and how it has affected the history culture and people of the various colonized countries.6. Learn about the role of the United Nations in determining a country’s “status.”7. Study the political economic and social structures as well as the history of West Timor.8. Use past United Nations Human Development Reports (you can access 1990-1998’s HDI’s on line at (//www.undp.org/hdro/index.htm)) to compare many facets of the average socioeconomic status of East Timor Indonesia other countries in the region and your country. What do these statistics illustrate? How might East Timor’s independence affect the statistics for these countries and why?Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Create a timeline of the steps taken in the United States’ gaining independence from Great Britain making your comments as general as possible. What types of groups were involved? What obstacles had to be overcome? What steps were taken to gain independence and how did the British react?Civics- Compare the voter turnout of the elections in East Timor to the turnout of national elections in the United States in the recent past. Why might voter turnout have been stronger in East Timor than in the United States? Graphically compare the statistics provided in the featured article to statistics from the upcoming presidential primaries and local elections in your city or state.Geography-Locate the cities regions and countries mentioned in the featured article and in other related articles on a map. Then investigate the significance of these places to past and present East Timor and Indonesia.-Compare and contrast cultural similarities and differences among the many countries in the region of East Timor (such as Indonesia Java Malaysia and the Philippines).Language Arts- Write a journal entry from the perspective of a citizen who is able to vote freely for the first time. What does he or she feel about this new freedom? What hesitations might this person have? Why is this freedom important to this citizen?Media Studies- Find articles in Indonesian newspapers as well as in papers from that region (including Australia) and around the world that discuss the voting in East Timor. Ecola Newsstand (//www.ecola.com) is a fantastic resource of English-language newspapers around the world. Why do different publications in different countries have varied views about the vote and its results? How is this vote anticipated to affect other countries in the region? How might this vote affect the international community and why? Create a scrapbook or collage (using headlines and photographs from various papers) of your findings.background: Timor is an island in southern Indonesia in the Malay Archipelago. The island was settled by the Portuguese in the early 1500s and the Dutch competed for influence until the early 1900s when final boundaries were determined. East Timor was a Dutch-Portuguese colony before decolonization and forcible annexation by Indonesia in 1975. However the United Nations has not recognized East Timor as an Indonesia possession. Human rights organizations claim that more than 200000 people (one-third of the native population) died as a direct result of the invasion. Today military occupation of East Timor continues to be a “hot topic” because of the territory’s history of human rights abuses and disputes over territorial authority.Other Information on the Web:NewsHour with Jim Lehrer: Crisis in East Timor (//www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec99/timor-index.html) includes the history of East Timor’s conflict with Indonesia a discussion with Jose Ramos-Horta the exiled E. Timorese resistance leader and an archive of the show’s past reports on the subject.East Timor Action Network (//www.etan.org/) urges action against the Indonesian invasion and occupation of East Timor.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Historical Understanding Standard 1- Understands and knows how to analyze chronological relationships and patterns.

Gelberman at the wedding of her eldest daughter Pamela Paine McGreevy 36.Her mother and her friends liken the bride to a character in a Jane Austen novel: bright-eyed alabaster-skinned smart and sensible. She and her mother are very close but they say they are not at all alike.

9,Kline May Sign On as Papp AideKevin Kline may soon be added to the list of directors whom Joseph Papp has hired to oversee programming at the Public Theater. Such a move some staff members feel could threaten the future of Mr. Papp's newly appointed artistic associate and apparent successor JoAnne Akalaitis. Mr. Papp is having discussions with Mr. Kline to supervise the Shakespeare marathon which began in January 1988 and which has so far included 15 of the 36 plays. Two of the more successful efforts have been Mr. Kline's "Hamlet" in which he starred and directed and "The Taming of the Shrew" with Tracey Ullman and Morgan Freeman directed by A. J. Antoon. Still Mr. Papp acknowledges he has been "unhappy with some of the work we've done" in the marathon.Staff members at the Public say he's also been uncertain about the long-term role of Ms. Akalaitis who has had trouble fitting in with the Shakespeare Festival's entrenched permanent staff. "She is very insecure and difficult to deal with and Joe hates insecurity more than anything" says one staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity adding that Ms. Akalaitis who is directing "Henry IV Parts 1 and 2" for a March 6 opening might not welcome reporting to Mr. Kline.Mr. Papp says: "Kevin Kline is one of our finest Shakespearean actors but he hasn't said yes yet. JoAnne Akalaitis is the best director we have and she will figure very prominently in the future of this institution." Mr. Papp says a lot also depends on Mr. Kline's film commitments. "We still need to formulate the relationships" he says. "Kevin might just direct or just act. He might also be on our board of directors. I want to hug him tighter to this institution." Mr. Kline's agent Jeff Hunter says "It would be premature to comment."Mr. Papp says he would like to see Mr. Kline create a small company using the talents of younger people. "I used to say that all you needed to do Shakespeare was two planks and a passion" he said. "I don't feel that way anymore. You need a psychological milieu which JoAnne knows how to create. Her 'Henry IV' is six hours of Shakespeare I really enjoyed. I think she and Kevin would make a wonderful alliance."

7,Yesterday Mr. Beame politicked in public. The amplified plinking of a ukelele helped attract a polite but undemonstrative crowd to the Time‐Life Building plaza at 50th Street and the Avenue of the Americas to hear him challenge his Republican opponent's law‐and‐order rhetoric.The presence of Mr. Beame attracted a crowd of dutiful Democratic officials — regular reform and unclassifiable — to sit on a flat‐bed trailer bedecked in plastic red white and blue bunting along with the man most politicians believe will be New York City's next Mayor.Former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy introduced Mr. Beame as “the next Mayor” and Mr. Beame reciting a familiar litany of official actions he has taken to help law enforcement said: “This is how you fight crime. You don't fight it by taking out newspaper ads or by hysteria.”Frank G. Rossetti the Manhattan Democratic leader was chief of protocol allocating seats on the trailer and was host later for hot dogs soda and beer at the opening of Manhattan headquarters for the Democratic team—Mr. Beame Paul O'Dwyer for City Council President and State Senator Harrison J. Goldin for Controller—at 16 West 57th Street.Mr. Beame wore a big “Go Mets” lapel button and an air of cheerful confidence as he accepted the deferential attention of people who clearly consider him a winner and thus a man who will have some say about their political well‐being.As far as Manhattan is concerned Mr. Rossetti said the black and Puerto Rican votes will be crucial and “I think we're going to do all right.”Mr. Beame said he thought so too. “Maybe it's just me” he said with a shrug to indicate his awareness that a candidate can be fooled by what goes on in his immediate neighborhood “but the reception's been so warm—I think it's going to be all right.”
9,Acting just minutes after a 12:01 A.M. deadline today the New York City Council approved bills that prevent a substantial increase in property taxes for owners of condominiums cooperatives and rental apartment buildings. The action came less than an hour after the State Senate paved the way for the Council's action.Property taxes for a typical condominium or cooperative apartment will increase by about $49 over the next year or less than 4 percent as a result of the bills according to calculations by the City Council staff. The bill for a typical owner of a one-  two- or three-family house will decrease by about $14.The Senate and the Council acted to block significantly higher increases for the owners of apartments that would have resulted from a decision three weeks ago by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment. The state board ruled that owners of apartments and apartment buildings should pay a larger share of the city's property taxes.The board's decision could have caused the tax bill for a typical apartment owner to go up by as much as $123 a year according to the city's Finance Department and it could have caused the typical single-family home owner's bill to decrease by $76.

8,The opportunity came for Tucker on Saturday afternoon with 11 seconds left. It was only the ninth 3-pointer in his last 49 attempts for the man Al Bianchi the team's general manager calls ''our pinch-hitter.''''When our offense needs a boost'' Bianchi said ''and it seems like there is a lid on our basket it's time for Trent to come in and take it off.''It hasn't always been that way for Tucker in his seven Knick reasons. He can remember Hubie Brown's coaching days when calls of ''power right'' and ''power left'' rang out from the bench and he was left out of the offense. Pitino has changed all that. He introduced a running game and incorporated the 3-point shot into the offense.''Rick is always aware where his 3-point shooters are'' said Tucker who is among the league leaders from 3-point range. ''He's got a very loud voice and it carries all over the court even when the Garden is filled.''There was a time the 3-point basket was looked upon as a desperation shot. Rick changed that. Properly executed the way we did it Saturday it can be a thing of beauty. When I'm shooting them well the basket looks like one big ocean to me.''But before Tucker found a coach who would believe in his long-range shooting he had to change his way of life especially during the off season.''When you're young'' said the 29-year-old Tucker ''you don't always watch what you eat and you don't stay in shape. You let your youth take care of that. But when Rick came in and talked about playing a much faster game you have to take care of your body to play that style of basketball. It called for a lot more running and drills. I wanted to be part of it so I worked hard.''It took Tucker only 45 games to break the club record of 69 3-pointers he set last year.

1,VideoDespite persistent unemployment malaise and continuing debt problems one sector in Europe seems to be benefiting: European banks.After years of painful job cuts and moves to make portfolios less risky several large European institutions reported strong first-quarter results in recent days helped by cost-cutting and better performance of major units.On Tuesday the Swiss bank UBS and the Lloyds Banking Group of Britain surprised investors by reporting better than expected earnings for the first quarter sending shares of both banks up.The British banks Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC along with the French bank BNP Paribas are among those still scheduled to report first-quarter figures in the coming days. But so far the first-quarter results paint a somewhat encouraging picture of banks that have managed to limit losses from bad loans linked to the credit crisis while reducing costs and returning to their core banking operations: credit and mortgages for some and wealth management for others.UBS for instance reported on Tuesday a first-quarter profit of 988 million Swiss francs ($1 billion). Those results were down slightly from 1 billion francs in the period a year earlier but far exceeded the 412 million francs predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Shares of UBS soared 5.67 percent in trading in Zurich on Tuesday.Sergio P. Ermotti the chief executive cautioned that it was “too early to declare victory” but said the earnings showed the company’s “business model works in practice.”Some investors note that the continuing difficulties in the euro zone and weak demand for loans mean that many European banks remain in trouble despite relatively good earnings in the first quarter.“They are doing their utmost to have a decent banking model and the numbers across the board were very good but going forward we now have the issue of where the growth is going to come from” said Florian Esterer a fund manager at the MainFirst Group in Zurich.Still European banks are moving actively to address their problems including by slashing costs in the face of changing regulations and a sluggish European economy. Deutsche Bank reported on Monday after the markets closed that its first-quarter profit rose as cost-cutting offset a decline in revenue from investment banking. Deutsche Bank’s stock also rose 4.7 percent in Frankfurt on Tuesday on the news that it would issue new shares to bolster its capital reserves.“There are still some headwinds but banks are pretty much there when it comes to reaching the right level of capital and that is helpful” said Cormac Leech an analyst at Liberum Capital.UBS has been eliminating 10000 jobs reducing bonus payments scaling back its investment banking trading business and focusing more on its successful wealth management operation. Those steps helped the bank’s first-quarter results.UBS its Swiss rival Credit Suisse and Barclays of Britain all benefited from higher revenue at its investment banking operation. At Credit Suisse pretax profit in its investment banking division rose 43 percent the bank said last week. Barclays which also reported earnings last Wednesday said pretax profit for its investment bank rose 11 percent in the quarter.Reducing costs and shedding assets also helped Lloyds report a first-quarter net profit of £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion). Those results were a sharp turnaround from the £5 million loss Lloyds posted in the first quarter of 2012.Analysts say European banks are also starting to recover from the fallout from numerous financial scandals that have hurt their reputations.UBS for example has sought to rebuild trust among clients after it uncovered a $2.3 billion trading loss in 2011 connected with the activities of a former trader Kweku M. Adoboli who has since been sentenced to seven years in jail. In December UBS said it would pay $1.5 billion in fines to settle a case related to the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate or Libor.Many of the other large European banks have also been ensnared in the rate-rigging scandal. Deutsche Bank has set aside 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) to cover the potential cost of proceedings that include a tax evasion inquiry in Germany and an international investigation into accusations that its employees and those at other investment banks colluded to fix benchmark interest rates.While financial institutions will continue to address such issues there is a cautious optimism now about bank performance.“There is a new appetite for banks among investors. There’s a confidence that wasn’t there two years ago” Mr. Leech said.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

0,The small immaculately catered luncheon that drew President Clinton to a stately home here today was billed as a benefit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But the anticipated recipient of much of the more than $1 million raised was the candidate who may have the least need for donations and the president's fund-raising help: Jon S. Corzine.Mr. Corzine the Wall Street multimillionaire who broke all records in spending nearly $35 million on his primary race has been a boon to Democratic candidates across the country because he has made heavy contributors out of wealthy friends in New Jersey and New York who were previously uninvolved in politics. Many were here today.Senator Robert G. Torricelli the chairman of the fund-raising committee who has begun to take a more direct hand in guiding Mr. Corzine's campaign as well missed the event because of a vote in Washington on aid to Colombia.But more than 40 people did show up paying at least $20000 apiece in addition to about a dozen local politicians. Among those who dined on medallions of poached Maine lobster tail under a backyard tent were former executives at Goldman Sachs & Company where Mr. Corzine was co-chairman until he resigned last year and other investment firms.

0,From left chefs Mario Batali Lidia Bastianich Bobby Flay and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.(Bill Cunningham/The New York Times Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times and Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times) From left chefs Mario Batali Lidia Bastianich Bobby Flay and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.(Bill Cunningham/The New York Times Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times and Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times)Ambitious restaurants often present new spins on old practices but one of the ways Del Posto dares to be different struck me as odd.It wasn’t worth mentioning in the limited space of a formal review and it isn’t something that detracts from the pleasurable experience of the restaurant. I nonetheless remain transfixed and perplexed by it.When I and other guests left Del Posto the little parting gift we received wasn’t a box of bon bons which is what diners at Telepan get or a coffee cake of sorts which is what the Modern and other restaurants hand out.It was . . . a bag of breadcrumbs. Yes breadcrumbs. Not be eaten later in the evening or the next morning but to be used presumably in some future cooking endeavor.The purpose of this unusual bequest may have to do with what accompanies it: a sheet of text about the various uses of breadcrumbs from a book by the superchef Mario Batali a television personality and one of the owners of Del Posto. With that text and that reference the restaurant hammers home the point that it is offering diners more than just a terrific meal. It is offering them a brush with culinary celebrity.Annotated breadcrumbs are just a part of that experience. On many nights Mr. Batali in chef’s whites and orange clogs personally delivers canapés to tables. Lidia Bastianich also one of the restaurant’s owners also the host of her own television show stands in the dining room whisking zabaglione. It could be argued that she’d do more good in the kitchen but the kitchen is out of view. Diners wouldn’t be able to see her there.This sort of exhibitionism isn’t unique to Del Posto not by a long shot. The open kitchen at Bar Americain affords diners a clear glimpse of the chef (and television personality) Bobby Flay. When I dined there he was usually standing at the edge of that kitchen as close to the dining room — and as noticeable — as possible.If Jean-Georges Vongerichten is at his restaurants Perry St. or Jean Georges on a given night diners will know it because he won’t stick to the stoves for the duration. He’ll take a promenade or two or three. He’d be silly — and it would be commercially self-defeating — not to.Even less vaunted establishments traffic in whatever gastronomic name recognition they can. At Pylos in the East Village where Diane Kochilas a widely recognized authority on Greek cuisine serves as the consulting chef her cookbooks are on display just inside the entrance.In restaurants as in movies star power draws an audience. Follow the trail of breadcrumbs to a savvy marketing strategy: if you’ve got a big name behind the scenes haul him or her onto center stage.

9,All of their garlic is organic as is the rocambole variety grown by Keith Stewart at Keith's Farm in Greenville N.Y. in western Orange County. He sells all of it at the Union Square Greenmarket. ''It's frightening what they spray on garlic'' Mrs. Nosonowitz said.This is the peak of the garlic season. Growers in the Northeast have harvested their crop and have either just finished curing it or will soon. They hang the garlic by its leaves for several weeks under controlled temperatures and humidity with fans blowing to dry it. After the garlic is trimmed and cleaned it is sorted according to size and variety and placed in string bags which are hung from the same rafters. From July to November mature garlic is at its best.If this local garlic is stored properly -- in a cool dry place in a string bag or garlic keeper -- it will last until February and be better than anything the supermarket has to offer which is commercially grown garlic that has come from thousands of miles away. Almost 90 percent of the garlic sold in this country comes from California.One of the biggest differences between local and California garlic is the basic variety: the former is hardneck which sends up a central stalk and is more tolerant of colder climates; California's is softneck which has a very small central stem.Chester Aaron who grows 87 kinds of garlic in Sonoma County Calif. and is the author of ''The Great Garlic Book'' (Ten Speed Press 1997) is partial to hardneck garlic. He said commercial farmers prefer the softneck because it is easier to grow produces greater yields is less labor intensive and lasts longer. But most softneck garlic has smaller cloves that are more difficult to peel and many insist tastes harsher. (It doesn't help that it is older when it gets here.)Hardneck garlic Mr. Aaron said ''has a span of tastes that is far wider than softneck. Whenever I do a tasting I will put out both and people's response is always that the hardneck is far superior.''The differences were certainly clear when Mrs. Nosonowitz sat me down to taste her freshly minced products offered on a spoon. She started me off with her favorite Prussian White also known as Music. It was pungent with a pleasing aftertaste. Then we moved on to Italian rocambole somewhat gentler than the Prussian but still pungent.

8,|KENNEDY PINS HOPES ON 'RIGHT CHEMISTRY'; Says He May Make Early Choice of Running Mate in Bid to Gain Convention Momentum Momentum of Conventions Freedom for Kennedy Delegates Preference for Early Decision
0,Did I write last week’s column simply to provoke you?The answer of course is no though for a moment this week I found myself seriously wondering about it as I re-read all your comments – 83 pages worth – in one long sitting.The question wasn’t unreasonable. I had after all written my account of Rebecca Riley’s death with a particular straw person in mind: someone who would generalize from her story to say that it was emblematic of what was happening in a sick society where kids are being medicated to shut them up make parents happy and assure doctors of “quick fix” solutions to cultural ills that no one has any desire to cure.Why did I seek to take that particular straw person on? And how did I know what he or she would be thinking?It’s very simple: that person used to be me.Some of you may perhaps recall that I used to sing a very different tune on the whole business of diagnosing and medicating children. It’s a topic I’ve come back to with some regularity because as some of you know I’ve been trying for the past three years to write a book on the mystery of why so many kids are being diagnosed with so many issues.My book was initially supposed to be a kind of social reading of the culture of pathology in our time. You know what I mean: this world of A.D.D. and O.D.D. and G.A.D. and O.C.D. and P.D.D.* and bipolar disorder that has replaced the world of playground fights and bloody noses and kids sitting on the floor in the hallway after they’ve been kicked out of class that we all recall from our childhood. I was supposed to deconstruct this world – of “affluent parents and neurotic kids” as my contract put it – taking on “the overanalyzing the overperfecting the overpathologizing of America’s children” and raising questions “about the way an anxious culture reproduces itself.”Some of you may find all this questionable. Even offensive. Parents of kids with “issues” generally do. In fact when I was starting out with the book a fair number of people including good friends of mine whose children suffer from emotional behavioral learning or developmental difficulties found my attitude – and my early postings here on the subject – just plain mean.I didn’t see what was mean about them. I didn’t see what was offensive or objectionable or even particularly opinionated. After all there had been no end to the news stories bringing to light how the drug companies manipulate and mislead consumers. There was no refuting the fact that the field of research psychiatry with its dependence upon Big Pharma for research grants was profoundly corrupted. There was no question that doctors pressured by managed-care companies and the demands of their own bottom line were dispensing too many meds in too little time asking too few questions and providing parents and kids with too few real answers. I didn’t see what was debatable about the notion that kids were by and large being overdiagnosed and overmedicated; that doctors and parents and teachers and schools were taking the easy way out; and that all were turning a collective blind eye to the pathological aspects of our culture that were showing up as symptoms in our kids. It seemed obvious to me that our children were truly the canaries in the coal mine for our sick culture and that we were drugging them in large part to neutralize their cries for help and to “help” them more efficiently get with the program. That was what I set out to write about.Most of you probably find that point of view appealing. Much more appealing perhaps than what I’ve been saying in recent weeks. But you see there was a problem. That original book tentatively titled “We’ve Got Issues: Childhood in the Age of Anxiety” never got written.For a long time I thought that it wasn’t getting written because I was too busy or too lazy or too scatterbrained to write it. But then I realized that it wasn’t getting written because it simply couldn’t be written. Its central argument was a tenable one in theory but it crumbled in practice when I ventured further than reading books and newspaper and magazine articles and got beyond theory and started to talk to real people. To real parents who consistently told stories of how they’d painfully accepted labels and medications for their kids only after exhausting every other possible option and to practitioners who often enough had themselves approached the whole issue of “flavor of the month” diagnoses like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder with skepticism but had then come to see their validity – and the value of properly prescribed medication – from the weight of evidence they’d amassed in clinical practice.I became aware over time that there was a name for people like me within the community of parents and doctors whose lives were consumed with treating children with A.D.H.D. and other issues: “naysayers.” I learned that we – the people who had no idea what it was like to parent a child with serious issues but found it easy to theorize and moralize and pontificate about the “abstract other” – were just one more burden that these parents and their children had to contend with in their already overburdened lives.Do you know what life is like for parents whose children end up on medication? It’s not filled with annoyance because troublesome Junior has come along to wreck your years of childless fun. It’s filled with things like having your 6-year-old beg you to push him in front of a truck because he doesn’t want to live anymore. Or having your 8-year-old cry while she struggles through her homework because her “brain is broken.” Or having your lovely 9-year-old start to do things like dump a plate of food on her head in the school cafeteria because well because everyone already thinks she’s the “weird kid” anyway. Parents who medicate have kids whose “antics” sometimes require calls to 911. For self-protection. Parents – most parents – who end up choosing to medicate do so because their kids are in serious pain.Now I’m not naïve. It is obvious that overdiagnosis and overmedication exist. Every doctor I’ve spoken with – even those who are most aggressive in wanting to raise awareness of disorders like A.D.H.D. and bipolar illness in kids – has said so. The practice of direct-to-consumer marketing is a scandal that has made serious mental illnesses banal and created an easy overeager and underscrutinized market for serious drugs. And I do think that a certain portion of what is sometimes labeled as pathology in children can be attributed to poor parenting poor schools and the pathological levels of stress and pressure that kids (and adults) now experience.We live in a depressing anxious-making and frenzied era; it’s no surprise that signs of depression anxiety and overwhelmed distractibility are so widespread. But there’s a difference between people who exhibit these signs of distress under certain conditions and those who show consistent signs of disorder under all conditions. Overdiagnosis is surely happening within the former group. But the latter group in many communities actually remains underdiagnosed.I now think that the worthwhile story to tell isn’t the one about the excesses of our era. It is rather about how in this brave new world of diagnosis medication brain science social services educational reform private consultants support groups Internet chat rooms and endless playground conversations about this or that nutritional therapy and this or that occupational therapy parents of children with issues still find themselves so profoundly alone. With all the talk and all the therapy and the theorizing and the moralizing we as a society are still failing them and their kids.I’m going to leave you with a few questions:What if children’s troublesome symptoms are not their truest form of self-expression?What if in the past it really wasn’t so great to leave “quirky” kids to tough it out on their own?What if recycling a watered-down version of ’60s-era radical thinking about psychiatry and the normalizing evils of mainstream society (“Mental illness is the revolt that the free organism in its total entity invents in order to live in an unbearable situation” is how Jean-Paul Sartre once put it) isn’t the best approach to take in today’s world?What if the whole topic deserves a new kind of radical rethinking?______________*The initials stand for: attention-deficit disorder oppositional defiant disorder general anxiety disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder and pervasive developmental disorder.Note to readers: For the next two weeks I will be writing a column for The New York Times Op-Ed page. My next column for TimesSelect will appear on Friday March 23.

1,ZULEIKHABy Guzel YakhinaWhenever I have taught Andrei Platonov’s hallucinatory masterpiece “Soul” a novella about the Soviet expansion into Central Asia I’ve noticed that many of my otherwise knowledgeable undergraduates have only a vague idea of what happened in Eastern Europe between the Russian Revolution and the 1980s liberalizations of Glasnost. It often seems that the terror and mass murder orchestrated by Stalin and his henchmen have somehow acquired at least in the West a weirdly kitschy ironic patina. In Manhattan a charming bar called KGB hosts literary readings in a space decorated with Communist-era memorabilia; one can hardly imagine similar events in a swastika-festooned Cafe Gestapo. Nor can one envision Hitler’s final days in the bunker portrayed with the zany slapstick that animated Armando Iannucci’s 2017 film “The Death of Stalin.”As we watch its heroine’s existence devolve from an oppressive domestic servitude into something disastrously worse Guzel Yakhina’s sprawling ambitious first novel “Zuleikha” reminds us just how brutal the Soviet system was. A devout Muslim living in a Tatar village in the Kazan region Zuleikha is married to the much older Murtaza and is in thrall to her blind and deaf mother-in-law a sadistic bully Zuleikha thinks of as the Vampire Hag who in turn refers to Zuleikha as “a pitiful hen.” Zuleikha begins her day by emptying the old woman’s chamber pot and — after gathering wood feeding the livestock cooking cleaning and being beaten by Murtaza — is finally allowed to sleep on the tin trunk studded with protruding nails that serves as her bed. Having borne four daughters who died in infancy Zuleikha is lonely and unhappy but patient submissive — and unable to imagine a life significantly better or worse than her own.Among her unpleasant duties is the task of hiding food from the Red Army soldiers who periodically arrive to raid the family larder: “At first they collected only grain. Then potatoes and meat. And during the Great Famine in 1921 they began making a clean sweep of everything edible. Poultry. Cattle. And everything they could find in the house.” Now the government has decreed that the kulaks — the wealthier peasants — need to be wiped out. Their land is to be seized and turned into collective farms while the farmers are to be slaughtered or deported to prison camps.“In the middle of February 1930 the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic … approve the decree ‘On the liquidation of kulaks as a class in Tataria.’” When Murtaza refuses to surrender some seed grain to the cavalryman who demands them he is shot and killed. Zuleikha — “as a kulak element of the first category. Active counterrevolutionary” — is evicted from her home and sent on the long punishing journey that will occupy much of the novel.

9,I AM quite possibly a fusspot about my mirages and so my own mirage list has always been exceedingly short. I'd had two favorites. Now since this last trip I have a triumvirate. And since as always with travel the perception of a place seems to depend as much upon the baggage we bring to the scene as upon the scene itself here are my three and my baggage:VENICE I never used to believe anything anybody told me or showed me about Venice. I had been seeing those picture books postcards paintings all my life as have we all. The requisite view of the Doges' Palace across the curve of the Grand Canal a dream floating on shimmering waters. The powerful A-frame forms of gondoliers silhouetted against shimmering waters. Shimmering waters lapping sweetly (garbage unseen) at the piers (decay unseen) of magnificent private palaces. All that shimmer and I would think Ah come on you are putting nothing over on me. It is not really a city that lives on water. Maybe a canal here and there but the postcard is just a chamber of commerce trick a cunningly chosen locale designed to convince us prospective tourists that the whole town really looks like this.But it did. So much so that I could not grasp it couldn't accept that the glorious illusion was real even as I followed those side streets (streams?) looking for where the fantasy might end and earthbound reality take over as in ''The Truman Show.'' But no. Water everywhere just as I had fervently hoped but not for a moment believed. That's a mirage.THE GRAND CANYON It was in the late 60's when my late husband Hal the swell surprise artist who had been there often arranged this particular surprise: Drove me there on the night of a full moon parked the car blindfolded me led me some distance then stopped and removed the blindfold. No one else around. Moon like a klieg light. And in the brilliance of that night and in the profoundest silence I'd ever heard I took one disbelieving look and shrieked -- simply yowled out my astonishment and the howl went echoing across those bottomless convolutions that could not possibly exist outside of dreams.PETRA Home of the Biblical Nabateans who in 600 B.C. came north from what is now Yemen into what is now Jordan south of the Dead Sea and there amid wildly sculptured sandstone peaks built a fortress city from which they controlled the trade route between the Egyptian and Greek and Roman cultures for 700 years.That's the history. But how to describe the mirage?Much of what makes the sight so remarkable is the tension between sight and setting as is often the case with mirages. You approach (on foot the only means allowed except to disabled visitors) through a great rock gorge that looks as brutal as rock gets. It is a half-mile long never wider than a two-car garage mostly much less and dim because the rock walls rising 100 feet on either side close inward as they rise leaving at the top a mere sliver of sky and leaving you a bit claustrophobic.Suddenly you see light at the end of this tunnel. And then dead ahead in this primordial nowhere in a clearing framed by these jagged rock walls appears the sublime facade of a Greco-Roman-Egyptian-style edifice five stories tall and celestially pink carved out of the side of a pink-sandstone mountain. Corinthian columns broken pediments griffins and urns the works.This vision is called The Treasury. Scores of temples tombs and theaters lead ever upward an arduous hour's hike in the heat to a final vision called The Monastery near the top. As I stood there trying to grasp what I had seen I heard music. A flute. A simple insistent tune wafting downward. I looked up and saw him a speck at the very top and began climbing. I was panting and drenched in sweat but this was my vision and my Pied Piper and how could I not follow?

0,The trial is expected to last two days.Mr. Bove was a little-known farmer and union official until last August when he and the nine other men took a tractor pick axes and power saws to the local McDonald's. Mr. Bove said at the time that he was incensed by what he saw as the unfairness of the United States to tax French delicacies like Roquefort cheese and pate de foie gras in retaliation for Europe's decision not to import hormone-treated American beef.''That tax decision was outrageous'' said Arianne Gurreau a schoolteacher who was camping with her boyfriend. ''I think the judge needs to see that there are all these people who think what he did was correct. We are fighting for values here for the right to care about what we eat.''Many came with their own fights inspired by Mr. Bove. ''What prompted us to come is the problem of water'' said Giselle Joffre a retired government worker. ''In our town it is terribly expensive because we are working with a big company. It is the same with all these multinationals doing what they want.''This was clearly not what many Millau residents had braced for. Most had seen pictures of protesters including Mr. Bove at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and feared that this demonstration would be just as disruptive.''People were so scared'' said Christianne Chazal-Martin the owner of a gift shop near the courthouse who decided to stay open. ''First one got talking and then another and they went on and on about how bad it was going to be.''Mr. Bove's attack on the McDonald's here last August was only one of a number of assaults on the fast food chain which is often a target of anti-American protesters. But Mr. Bove became instantly famous when he was thrown in jail for it and then refused to pay bail for three weeks in protest. Eventually he did pay the bail with money supplied by a group of supporters many of them American.Mr. Bove faces charges that could result in a fine of as much as $70000 and up to five years in jail. But it is considered unlikely that he or any of his co-defendants will serve any jail time for the vandalism which resulted in $110000 worth of damage.

1,When the Liberty traded for center Kia Vaughn in January Coach Bill Laimbeer knew there was a caveat.Vaughn did not have a history of balky knees or a penchant for controversy. She has been quite the opposite for much of her nine-year career: a team leader and a stabilizing presence in the lane.But Vaughn did have a passport from the Czech Republic signaling her commitment to its national team. That includes playing in the EuroBasket tournament in Prague and Hradec Kralove and leaving behind the Liberty for most of June.“It’s very hard” said Vaughn a New York native. “It got harder when I got traded home.”Vaughn’s Czech citizenship “opens up other doors for me business-wise” she said. “As a professional you want to open up as many doors as you can for as long as you can. I’m not sure when my career will come to an end.”

8,Fin swimming in which competitors use rubber fins to add a powerful boost to their kick is a fast sport that has been making slow progress in the United States since it was imported from Europe a few years ago. Now one version of it seems to have reached its high-water mark.The first United States Eastern Fin Swimming Championships held March 21 at Westchester Community College in Valhalla N.Y. were also billed as the first such meet anywhere in a short-course pool (25 yards) rather than in a 50-meter long-course. As a result of the experience they may be the last. As the 15 entrants discovered the speed advantage that fin swimming enjoys over barefoot swimming on long courses disappears when a short course is used and for an obvious reason: The flippers that add so much power to a kick are a distinct disadvantage in making a flip turn.In long-course events the superiority of fins is substantial. For example the world 50-meter freestyle record is 22.33 seconds while the fin swimming record for the same event is a blistering 15.4. In the 100 the world swimming record is 48.74 while the fin swimming record is 38.2. (Fin records incidentally would presumably be even lower if the best swimmers took up the sport. As it is fin swimmers tend to be scuba divers.) In the Eastern championships Gary Antonick of Virgina Beach won the one-flip-turn 50-yard apnea an underwater event in 18.1 seconds only slightly faster than the American swimming record of 19.22. Peppo Biscarini of Los Angeles who had to use his flippers for three flip turns won the 100-yard event in 43.3 seconds actually slower than the finless record of 41.87.The meet organizer Frank May who settled on the 25-yard Westchester pool only because there were no Olympic-size pools available in the metropolitan area said later that he wasn't sure about an encore next year. In the meantime he figures that the 1987 championships were a watershed: Every winner set a short-course record.

0,If you're a secret service agent reaching for the red telephone relax. My brother is one of the gentlest men I've ever met. But he knows his neighbors - not just the ones who live next door but also the virtual homelander community that's scattered coast to coast. He surfs the right-wing-media scrum on a daily basis the blog sites the AM radio and Fox News blather-fests. He hears the hatred the viciousness and the unreason. "I hate that stuff" he admits. "All the mocking and the lack of civility. It's nutty how some conservatives talk. Just like it's nuts how liberals talk about George Bush. But that's how people feel."It's late summer and we've been driving for a week through southwestern Kansas down across the interlocking panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas dipping into New Mexico. For blue state types this is enemy territory the undiluted heart of red America. For a hundred miles in any direction the culture war is over. The Democratic Party has dried up and blown away.A woman down in Texas told me with a kind of superstitious awe of seeing a single Democratic sign in some poor fool's yard during the 2004 campaign "It's like putting a bull's-eye on your property. If you ever told people you were a Democrat like at a party or something they'd think you were just plain crazy."Most of the things that stick in the craw of conservatives are either nonexistent or invisible here. The nearest abortion clinic is half a day's drive north in Wichita Kansas. Gays and lesbians who live in this part of the country are tolerated for the most part so long as they keep their sexuality to themselves. "Of course we have gay people here too" says David Scott chairman of the Republican committee in Ochiltree County Texas "but it's sort of Don't ask Don't tell. They're treated well but they're not marching down the streets either."In some of these sprawling counties nine out of ten voters chose George Bush to be their president and they would do it again in a heartbeat. In summer 2005 as Allen the boys and I road-tripped through homelander America Bush's approval rating was plummeting in much of the nation battered by Iraq and endless scandals but his rural base was unperturbed. One survey found that the president's popularity was actually growing in a half-dozen homelander states up 25 percent in Utah up 11 percent in Idaho and up 5 percent in Oklahoma.In this parallel America the New York Times and CNN feel as remote and irrelevant as the Village Voice or Le Figaro. The radio dial offers a scratchy drone of conservative and evangelical chatter delivered with complacent easy-going certainty. These are the voices of men preaching to a vast far-flung choir. With Rush and Dr. Dobson scripting the libretto the music of rural America is scored by a parade of puff-chested country-and-western singers thanking God for their families and the U.S.A."I'm just a singer of simple songs" croons Alan Jackson. "I'm not a real political man. I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you the difference between Iraq and Iran. But I know Jesus and I talk to God ..."Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAfter six days of this stuff even David is tired of it or maybe he's just eager to dust off one of his corny jokes: "If you play country music backward" he says "your wife comes back your boat's fixed and your truck'll start running." And maybe homelanders will start voting for Democrats again.The occasional jangle of a Spanish-language tejano station begins to sound downright transgressive. It hints at far-off things at impending change like the rumbling of a thunderstorm on the horizon. And things are changing. This isn't a fair sample of modern America not by a long shot. The Rockies rise out that way somewhere and the Pacific slope stretches beyond with its vast suburban metroplexes. In the opposite direction back East there are cities so dense and byzantine that at this remove they resemble biological organisms.Somewhere on this continent there are three hundred million people a dizzying mix of different races and creeds and faiths a crackling Internet Starbucks skyscrapers. But here there is only the humbling imperative of land and emptiness. It's so profound so global in scope that it reduces all the rest of creation to myth and figment.Allen points ahead at a punctuation a shape of light on the rim of the world. Grain silos anchor hundreds of these midwestern towns rising bleached and massive like Mexican cathedrals. Their bulk suggests a hidden bounty dispersed like manna over the emptiness. The two kids David and my own son Nicholas stir with restless energy. "How long until we get there?" Nicholas asks. "Can we get hamburgers?"His cousin is a political junkie but at age ten my boy is baffled by this whole enterprise. Drive around asking people their opinions? Strike up conversations with complete strangers about politics? He thinks the whole thing is nuts. "You know what you think Papa. And you know they don't agree with you.""That's why I'm curious about their ideas" I tell him. "I want to know why they think the way they do.""But you're not going to change your mind are you?""No probably not. Not much anyway.""Are they?""I doubt it."Nicholas is unconvinced. So is Allen to be honest. He has gamely agreed to play the role of rural conservative the red yin to my blue yang but he's a little nervous. "You just can't make me look like a bumbling idiot" he says.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIt's a reasonable enough concern. Metros have made a sport of denigrating rural Americans. Even as they lose battle after battle urban pundits and politicians continue to dismiss homelanders as bumbling hicks too stupid or misguided to look out for their own welfare. "People getting their fundamental interests wrong is what American political life is all about" Frank writes on the first page of What's the Matter with Kansas? "This species of derangement is the bedrock of our civic order; it is the foundation on which all else rests."The day after the 2004 election London's Daily Mirror published a front-page banner that was adopted as a talking point by millions of American metros: "How can 59054087 Americans be so dumb?"There is practically a sub-genre of urban punditry that aims to diagnose GOP supporters like my brother. Depending on whom you ask they are racists neurotic failures or morons. One scholarly paper widely circulated on the Internet (it served as the basis for an article in the on-line magazine Slate) attempted to identify the "specific variables that have been hypothesized to predict conservatism." The motivating factors included fear aggression "intolerance of ambiguity" and (my personal favorite) "anxiety arising from mortality salience."Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The official-looking chart later debunked ranked Kerry voters at 100-115 IQ points while slatternly Bush voters drooled along in the 85-100 point range. It received half a million hits in a single day and was fodder for articles in The Economist and Florida's St. Petersburg Times.In March 2006 a University of California-Berkeley researcher published a paper in the Journal of Research in Personality claiming that whiny insecure children grow up to be conservatives with right-wing traditional values. "The confident kids turned out liberal and were still hanging loose turning into bright non-conforming adults with wide interests" wrote Kurt Kleiner in a Toronto Star article that circulated widely on metro blog sites. "[The study] reasons that insecure kids look for the reassurance provided by tradition and authority and find it in conservative politics.""One of the biggest changes in politics in my lifetime" argued progressive journalist Bill Moyers in a speech after the 2004 election "is that the delusional is no longer marginal. It has come in from the fringe to sit in the seat of power in the Oval Office and in Congress. When ideology and theology couple their offspring are not always bad but they are always blind. And there is the danger: voters and politicians alike oblivious to the facts."This kind of fear and distrust is widespread in metro culture. When I began work on this project a common objection voiced by friends and colleagues was that homelanders were simply too backward to warrant serious scrutiny. "I think you're taking this multiculturalism thing too far" a fellow writer told me. "Sometimes certain cultural values are just wrong. Maybe even evil."I asked him for an example and after a pause he said "Genital mutilation. Or genocide.""No I mean give me an example of something evil that conservative rural Americans are doing."He thought for a long time. I could see that he was determined to produce clear evidence that homelanders were as dangerous and threatening as a band of cannibals. "Supporting the war in Iraq" he said finally. "And pushing millions of Americans into poverty. And the deliberate erosion of civil liberties. And the separation of church and state."Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAll of which struck me as valid concerns especially in an era when the Democratic Party offered only a token counterweight to the Republicans. But there's a sizable gulf between the Patriot Act and the Beer Hall Putsch a lot of ideological bandwidth between picketing a Planned Parenthood clinic and genital mutilation."My idea" I said testing it on another colleague "is to look for the people and institutions that are disseminating these traditional ideas. I don't mean the screamers. I want to find intellectuals writers and thinkers who are shaping the movement. I want to find communities where these principles are being applied. Let's see how well they work."A skeptical silence followed. "Well take creationism" I said. "It's inching its way into textbooks now. Tens of millions of Americans believe in it including my own nephews. Nineteen states are talking about downgrading evolution in science classes describing it as a theory on a par with intelligent design. So where does that stuff come from? How does it fit into in people's lives? There must be someone in the conservative community who's really thought deeply about this stuff.""What if there's not?""What do you mean?""Do you really think you'll find someone who can defend that nonsense in a thoughtful way?""But conservatives have universities now. They have think tanks and journalists. They can't all just be lunatics and propagandists.""What if they are? George Bush is their leader and he's not exactly a thoughtful guy. It seems to me that the Right is made up of a few very bad and manipulative people and a lot of very stupid and gullible people."This from a friend who is worldly and thoughtful and as open-minded as anyone I've ever met. He would never dream of talking dismissively about a traditional society in Africa say or Central America. The difference of course is that those rural tribesmen can't vote in our elections. They don't make decisions that affect our urban-centric lives. They can't tell us who we can marry. They can't tap our phones. They can't send our kids off to war.This sort of fear and loathing has made it difficult for metros to understand what they're up against: not a group of crazy Bible-thumping zealots but smart aggressive political activists with a coherent agenda. Republican strategist Bill Greener often serves as a consultant on rural political campaigns. He shakes his head at urban America's sneering assessments of the homelander movement delivered (as he describes it) "in the tone of 'What's wrong with these people?' I don't think that does the Democratic Party any favors" he says.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyCertainly not with voters like Allen who fumed for days after Howard Dean dismissed Republicans as "pretty much a white Christian party" and complained that conservatives had "never made an honest living in their lives." Dean later said that he was talking about GOP leaders not rank and file voters and he complained that his words had been taken out of context. But for many homelanders the flap was proof that top Democrats don't respect rural issues or cultural values. "That is the thing that sticks under my skin more than anything else: the level of condescension I often feel" Allen says "when I'm talking to somebody and express a conservative viewpoint and they think that I must be a complete idiot for having those viewpoints. It's almost like a kick in the gut. You know that whatever you say the gulf between you and them is so vast that there's no way to even have the conversation. I want to feel like the positions of my people are respected."The first signs of civilization on the outskirts of Guymon Oklahoma are a truck stop a trailer park and an empty cattle yard. Towns out here have the quality of settlements along some tenuous trade route. The houses are modest the brick streets wide enough for a military parade. The sidewalks feel empty.There are churches everywhere some big and cocky looking but most of them modest and spare. God is ubiquitous in this country on billboards on the radio even on the editorial pages of local newspapers which often offer daily passages from Scripture. In my notebook there is a quote copied down from the top of a roadside picnic table: "The best drug of all is when Jesus calls." The words were carved with deliberate calligraphic neatness into the pine planking next to mustard stains and etchings of phalluses. "If you listen you can hear. Jesus is with you everywhere."For those of us from the other America from the realm of cities and suburbs rush hours and Google-enhanced globalization homelander culture feels strange and arid. We suspect that there are pieces missing as if the concept of a society had been sketched out quickly in rough draft with the details and subtlety and nuance to be added later.The people too seem improbably spare their hearts filled with blunt notions of patriotism and kinship and the Holy Gospel. They believe that certain things are right and proper and certain other things just aren't.This kind of thing offends the urban sensibility. Perhaps it's no surprise that city folk who encounter it so often respond with irony or flat-out scorn. "The tailgates groan with huge coolers and groan even more when proud gigantic rear ends are added" wrote Christopher Hitchens in Vanity Fair after a reportorial dip into the rural culture of Virginia. "Should you desire to remove the right to bear arms from these people you might well have to prize away a number of cold dead chubby fingers." . . .

9,Among the gentlemanly post-collegiate folk groups that proliferated from the late 1950's until the advent of folk-rock in the mid-60's none had the hip cachet of the Chad Mitchell Trio which performed a reunion concert on Saturday evening at Symphony Space.Not only did the group's taste in material have a sharper political edge than that of its peers but with a membership that included two first-rate folk-pop crooners (Mr. Mitchell and Joe Frazier) and one rougher-edged personality voice (Mike Kobluk) it also refined an unusually flexible vocal blend.That blend was as smooth and tight as ever at Saturday's concert at which the trio performed about 20 old favorites before an audience that seemed to remember every word. The concert was a reminder that the folk-pop style exemplified by the Mitchell trio fused modern barbershop with the folk music movement that had been gathering strength since the heyday of the Weavers.Oh how times have changed since the genteel button-down era when witty folk songs gently tweaking the Establishment could be considered subversive and the voices doing the tweaking never rose above a tone of polite disagreement.

9,White House officials said today that aides to President Clinton had used the Presidential helicopter for their own purposes on a dozen occasions but the announcement deemed legitimate all but one of the trips -- the outing to a golf course last week.The list of 11 other flights disclosed by the White House today nevertheless raised new questions about the use of helicopters from the Presidential fleet. While most of the missions were described as training flights by White House military aides or officials from the White House military office one was listed as a "classified" mission in which the passengers were Henry G. Cisneros the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Alice M. Rivlin the deputy director of the Office and Management and Budget.Dee Dee Myers the White House spokeswoman said the flight on April 14 was "in connection with their official duties" but she and other Administration officials refused otherwise to describe the purpose of the journey or say why the officials would be involved in a classified mission. New Procedures AdoptedIn making public the new information the White House said it had adopted new procedures to guard against further incidents of misuse like the golf outing last week that led to the forced resignation of David Watkins the White House director of administration.

0,The number of international terrorist attacks increased by 8 percent last year largely because of a surge in bombings by two rebel groups in Colombia and attacks by paramilitary groups operating there the State Department said today.South Asia remains the focal point for terrorism directed against the United States the department's annual report on global terrorism said with the Taliban in Afghanistan continuing to provide safe haven for international terrorists and Pakistan backing terrorist groups as well.Despite the concerns about Pakistan and Afghanistan contained in the report for the second year in a row they were not added to the list of nations accused of state-sponsored terrorism. Cuba Iran Iraq Libya North Korea Sudan and Syria have long held that designation which brings with it strict sanctions.The report is based on data collected in the final year of the Clinton administration but officials said the Bush administration had ample time to review and change the report and therefore it represents the first view of global terrorism under the new administration.
1,MONDAY PUZZLE — And so the holiday season has officially ended for another year. Time to get back to work right? Maybe it’s O.K. to ease into it.Today’s ThemeOf course we all don’t float from soiree to soiree through this part of winter — I confess to usually losing the fight against hibernation — but Jan. 2 notoriously hits with a thud this year on a Monday no less. Although that meant the solve was pretty quick there was a clever and well-timed little theme that made it satisfying.If you knew any of the four longest down clues you filled in four bubbles in each that spelled some sort of jubilation. The dead-center down clue 21D — “Really revel …” — reiterated and corresponded to the theme phrase which was its answer.I was inspired to hunt for the origin of the theme phrase PARTY DOWN and got nothing earlier than 1970s references starting with a 1974 summer soul song by Little Beaver. Maybe someone has more scholarly information for the comments; there’s no doubt that there’s a funkiness to the expression but funk has existed in other forms throughout history hasn’t it?

9,In Washington the Rev. Sean McManus the President and founder of the Irish National Caucus an Irish lobby on Capitol Hill said: "My reaction to paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King is peace at last peace at least thank God Almighty we have peace at last."But expressing misgivings Father McManus said: "I believe that there is an obvious danger that loyalist paramilitaries will set out to sabotage the cease-fire. That's the danger everybody fears. Nonetheless I am hopeful that because of the outpouring of world support to this new development they'll think twice about doing that because it would put them in an untenable position."Father McManus said assassinations carried out in the past by Protestant militants had always raised suspicions of British complicity. "Now with the I.R.A. on cease-fire this is going to be an absolute test of the commitment of the British Government and the British Army to this peace process."Paul O'Dwyer the New York lawyer long active in seeking an end to the British presence in Northern Ireland said: "A cease-fire does not eliminate the position of the British Army in Ireland. I will not be happy about the situation till they have left."But he said he believed the truce would endure. "I think the cease-fire will hold because I believe the British have really been tired of paying out $75 billion a year for the maintenance of a British Army on Irish soil." Issue of British PresenceFrank Durkan a colleague of Mr. O'Dwyer in the firm of O'Dwyer & Bernstein and a member of the Brehon Law Society composed of many Irish-American lawyers who have defended I.R.A. members in the United States said "Of course there's no need to emphasize it's always good to hear that killing and maiming has come to a stop. That's certainly a plus from anyone's point of view."But he said "Nowhere do I hear that the British have declared an intention of leaving Northern Ireland. That means that another generation or two or three may look and see that there is an intruder in their land and elect to once again start hostilities. I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm not ready to go out and dance in the streets."
9,If the United States is going to intervene militarily in Haiti it should do so soon. Prolonging the sanctions (even the new improved version) when they are causing such hardship for ordinary Haitians while at the same time having so little impact on the renegade Government is both cruel and indefensible.President Clinton has spelled out why he feels the United States has a special interest in Haiti and why the use of force to restore President Aristide is being considered. Haiti is "in our backyard" Mr. Clinton said and it is the only country in the Western Hemisphere in which the military has seized power from an elected leader. Haiti and Cuba are the only two countries in the hemisphere that are not democratic.President Clinton also noted that if democracy was not restored to Haiti the United States at some point would face an enormous surge of new refugees seeking to settle here. (Keeping those refugees out has been the cornerstone of American policy to date.) Other points of special interest according to Mr. Clinton include the thousands of Americans who live in Haiti and the one million Haitian-Americans who live here. Finally there is the fact that Haiti has become a staging area for drug shipments to the United States.Mr. Clinton did not mention the important role the United States Government has played in the exploitation of the Haitian people. This has occurred through U.S. Government support -- both direct and covert -- for a series of repressive regimes and through the long-term exploitation of cheap Haitian labor by American businesses. The U.S. has an interest in acknowledging those abuses and in making the effort to act as a friend rather than an oppressor of the Haitian people.The military in Haiti believes it has won its battle of the wills with the United States. "Sometimes" said an American diplomat "the military leaders believe we were never serious about restoring Aristide and other times they think we may have been serious but lacked the will. Either way they have felt triumphant."

9,Windows 98 went on sale last week with little fanfare and supported by a puny marketing budget compared with the spending for its relentlessly promoted predecessor Windows 95. And Windows 98 also came to market under a legal cloud as Exhibit A in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation.No matter it seems at least not in the first few days. Windows 98 flew off store shelves just as quickly as did Windows 95 when it went on sale even slightly faster according to PC Data a market research firm.In the first four days of sales from last Thursday through Sunday retailers sold 530000 copies of Windows 98 PC Data reported yesterday based on daily sales reports from 20 chains with 6000 stores. In its first four days on the market three years ago Windows 95 sold 510000 copies.Microsoft had sought to deflate expectations for Windows 98 positioning the new operating system as a ''tune-up'' to its predecessor instead of a ground-breaking new product. With the low-key introduction most analysts had expected Windows 98 sales to build more gradually than was the case with Windows 95.

1,Of the men named on the list seven ended up losing their jobs or having significant professional setbacks before the year was out. (Others who lost jobs after complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior — including Michael Oreskes of National Public Radio a former reporter and editor at The Times and Mike Germano of Vice Media to name two —were not named on the list and became subjects of company investigations after allegations against them appeared in The Times The Post and other publications.)The GQ political correspondent Rupert Myers was the first man identified on the list to lose his job about a week after the spreadsheet went live. Five days later Leon Wieseltier the former literary editor at The New Republic apologized for his “offenses against some of my colleagues in the past” and a new magazine he was editing under the auspices of the Emerson Collective an organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs was canceled. Soon afterward the list claimed another high-ranking New Republic figure the magazine’s president and publisher Hamilton Fish who resigned on Nov. 3.Lorin Stein the editor of The Paris Review informed the magazine’s board that he had been named. After an investigation conducted by the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton he resigned on Dec. 6. The next week The New Yorker said it had parted ways with its Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza. (CNN put Mr. Lizza on leave from his job there as a commentator reinstating him the next month after a company investigation “found no reason” to keep him off the air.)The list was still having an impact in late December when BuzzFeed fired Adrian Carrasquillo a White House correspondent and the National Geographic did the same with the photojournalist Patrick Witty (who has also worked for The Times).Mr. Witty in a written statement denied the accusations against him although he acknowledged that he might have acted inappropriately. “I am saddened to think that I in any way have contributed to or reinforced the imbalance of power between men and women in my industry” he said.The rest of those named on the list who lost jobs declined to comment.Some of the men whose names appeared on the document but did not end up suspended or fired said the list had nonetheless affected their professional and personal lives.“It’s so naïve to think that just because no one has spoken out that means that there aren’t any false accusations” said a man who agreed to discuss the document only if his name was not used because he did not want to draw further attention to his appearance on the list. “It just means that the men that have been falsely accused are petrified.”
1,BUENOS AIRES — ¿Quieres aprender cómo llegar al corazón de un dispositivo médico o de una máquina de votación electrónica? ¿Tal vez sea un smartphone o incluso un automóvil? Gracias al legado de un régimen militar y a una cultura de romper las reglas Argentina se ha convertido en uno de los mejores lugares del mundo para encontrar personas capaces de enseñarte estos trucos.Ya que la caza de talentos de Silicon Valley ahora es global esta nación se ha convertido en un terreno fértil para el reclutamiento de corporaciones y gobiernos extranjeros. Las empresas necesitan hackers para defenderse de los delincuentes cibernéticos y espías gubernamentales. Y a medida que la infraestructura fundamental del mundo se muda a Internet y la amenaza de guerra llega al ciberespacio los gobiernos están desesperados por contar con hackers y sus herramientas.“Burlar al sistema es parte de la mentalidad argentina” comentó Cesar Cerrudo investigador de seguridad que aprendió a hackear desde la adolescencia cuando vivía en Paraná un pequeño pueblo en el noreste del país. Hace poco se hizo famoso por acceder ilegalmente al sistema de semáforos de ciudades de Estados Unidos.“Salvo que seas rico seguramente creciste sin computadora o leyendo libros. Para tener acceso a un software nuevo tenías que hackearlo y tenías que aprender todo desde cero” dijo Cerrudo.En años recientes Brasil se ha dado a conocer como el líder mundial en fraude bancario por Internet pero los hackers argentinos son reconocidos por su creatividad. En especial por su capacidad de encontrar las “fallas de día cero” las vulnerabilidades de seguridad en la tecnología que pueden utilizarse para espiar o incluso destruir las redes de los adversarios.Compañías como Apple Facebook y Google han encriptado sus productos y servicios para que en la mayoría de los casos la única forma de supervisar las comunicaciones de un blanco sea hackeando directamente el dispositivo. En consecuencia a los gobiernos les urge conseguir los exploits de día cero (fragmento de software utilizado para aprovechar la falla de seguridad el día que es descubierta).En octubre un grupo de ejecutivos de varias partes del mundo compuesto por funcionarios gubernamentales contratistas y (según rumores) espías se reunieron aquí en un edificio industrial convertido en centro cultural para observar a los hackers argentinos en el onceavo EkoParty anual la conferencia de hackeo más importante de América Latina.Es imposible decir cuántos hackers viven en Argentina pues acceder ilegalmente a las computadoras generalmente no es una habilidad que a los argentinos les gusta promocionar. Pero EkoParty que tuvo 1.600 asistentes este año es reconocido como el mejor lugar para encontrarlos.“Argentina se puso en el mapa como el país con los mejores hackers” dijo Sinan Eren ejecutivo de Avast Software una compañía de seguridad con sede en Praga que ha asistido a la conferencia durante años.
0,The American authorities in the last week directed a United States-bound flight from Mexico to turn around in midair and imposed extraordinary security measures on at least six other incoming flights because of terrorist concerns federal officials said Wednesday.Officials were so concerned about possible attacks on at least five foreign flights that landed in the United States including one on Wednesday night at Dulles International Airport outside Washington that they moved the planes away from the main terminals and rescreened the passengers.The security moves along with the cancellation of several flights on Dec. 24 by Air France to Los Angeles reflect an aggressive new approach toward guarding United States airspace because of concerns that terrorists may seek to hijack an international flight. The strategy is an outgrowth of the ''high risk'' alert status initiated 11 days ago.While officials said they wanted to cooperate with other nations to strengthen security they also said they were unwilling to let foreign flights into United States airspace without rigorous security checks.

9,The strategy Gary Kasparov used against Nigel Short in Game 11 of their world championship match yesterday in London was to pit an advantage in mobility and space against one of material. But Short defended obstinately and brought the game to a draw by exchanging off everything that might do him harm.The score is now 8 to 3 in Kasparov's favor and he is inching steadily toward the 12 1/2 points that will give him the $1.43 million winner's share of the $2.55 million prize in the 24-game series.At the end of yesterday's game Short was still two pawns ahead but they would have been permanently blocked and hence nonfunctional. Kasparov had earlier sacrificed them to ruin the mobility of the black pawns and pieces but he did not succeed in showing that he had more than equality. Short's oranges proved equivalent to Kasparov's apples. The black array may have looked awfully disheveled but it wouldn't go away and that was what mattered.Kasparov switched from his usual Ruy Lopez to the Scotch Opening with 3 d4 ed 4 Nd4 for this game. It was no surprise for Short since the Russian was the one who got this method of play out of mothballs three years ago in his title defense against Anatoly Karpov in New York and Lyons France. Kasparov succeeded in demonstrating that the strategy of knocking out the black center pawn early on was neither as simple nor as primitive as had long been believed. A Rare Choice by Kasparov

1,And to Drink… Eric Asimov the wine critic for The New York Times suggests a drink pairing for one of the week’s recipes.Pairing decisions are part analytical and importantly part emotional. Almost nothing will go better with this creamy pungent savory ramp omelet by David Tanis than those two amplifiers of umami fino sherry and Champagne. That’s the rational choice yet what I want most is gamay the grape of Beaujolais. Why? Back in the old days when being able to prepare a perfect omelet was considered evidence of cooking ability my custom for my first meal on any trip to France was to stop in at a cafe or bar à vin for an omelet with a glass of the easygoing house Beaujolais. For me this combination was comfort and beauty. Nowadays I might choose a gamay from the Loire Valley or one of the few American versions like Edmunds St. John’s which I think come closer to those lighthearted yet compelling wines. The rational choice? Maybe not but it sure felt like a great one.What would you pair with this dish? Post your suggestions in the comments section.

1,HAMBURG Germany — Women in Germany won the right to vote in 1918 but a century later they still do not enjoy equal representation. Though the country is led by a woman — who will most likely be succeeded by another woman — fewer than a third of the members of the federal Parliament the Bundestag are female.That’s why leading figures from all major German parties are now calling for parity: a 50-50 quota for male and female representatives in the Bundestag and the 16 state-level Parliaments. But is achieving a gender balance in Germany’s legislatures worth weakening another hard-fought accomplishment the right to free electoral choice?This week the Parliament in Brandenburg became the first to require all political parties to nominate an even slate for state elections starting in late 2020. The center-left Social Democratic Party is pushing for a similar rule for national elections. The party is already informally enforcing such a rule in its selection of candidates for the coming European Parliament elections in May in the process overruling the results of local party votes.Most people can agree that equal representation in our elected bodies is a desirable goal. In a democracy the people’s representatives should look like the people. Laws that put more women onto the field might look like a good start. And parity laws achieve that goal. “I am not a great fan of quotas but I like the results they bring” said Viviane Reding a former commissioner of the European Union.

9,Most politicians try to sidestep issues that divide voters along militant angry lines. But New York City's mayor Rudolph Giuliani firmly rejected that kind of evasion when asked about late-term abortions during a trip to Texas.The mayor said with no apparent qualifier that he did not plan to change his current position in favor of abortion rights to suit the leadership of New York's Conservative Party. Its chairman is calling on Mr. Giuliani to join other well-known Republicans in endorsing a ban on the late-term procedures that they refer to as partial birth abortions. But the mayor has steadfastly refused to alter his support of abortion rights. He did so again Monday in Texas in the company of Gov. George W. Bush with whom he disagrees on this issue.What makes the mayor's stand particularly stalwart is that it could easily jeopardize his nomination by the Conservative Party of New York State. No Republican has won a statewide election in the last 25 years without the Conservative Party line on the ballot a position that generally carries from 200000 to 350000 votes. If the expected race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Giuliani tightens those votes would look even sweeter than they do already. The Conservative Party chairman Michael Long vows that he will not bargain on the issue. Mr. Long is even threatening to bring out an ''aggressive'' candidate to run on the Conservative line unless the mayor changes his mind and agrees to endorse a ban on late-term abortions. This extra candidate would surely siphon votes away from Mr. Giuliani and help Mrs. Clinton's chances.Once next year's Senate campaign is in full throttle Mr. Long may view things differently. Mr. Giuliani may eventually make a courtesy visit to the Conservatives and try to persuade them to respect either his principled stand or at least the political realities. But the Giuliani camp said that his basic position would not be compromised making this a case in which the mayor's stubborn streak is well deployed.
1,PhotoLOS ANGELES — Another one bites the dust: “Our Brand Is Crisis” collected a dismal $3.4 million at North American theaters over the weekend extending a cold streak for Warner Bros. and exacerbating concerns in Hollywood about the recent failure of high-profile dramas including “Steve Jobs” and “The Walk” to find audiences.“The Martian” (2oth Century Fox) remained at No. 1 taking in about $11.4 million for a five-week total of $182.8 million.Starring Sandra Bullock as a political strategist the heavily marketed “Our Brand Is Crisis” which received weak reviews cost roughly $28 million to make. Warner which has suffered flops like “Pan” and “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” is now counting on a pair of dramas to salvage its year: “Creed” a boxing movie that attempts to revive the “Rocky” series and “In the Heart of the Sea” about the sinking of a whaling ship.“We’re very proud of the film” Jeffrey B. Goldstein Warner’s executive vice president for domestic distribution said in an email on Sunday about Ms. Bullock’s movie. “We had hoped to get a wider audience and I’m disappointed with this result.”Hollywood always struggles when Halloween falls on a Saturday but two other new releases also disappointed taking in less than analysts had predicted based on surveys that track interest. “Burnt” (the Weinstein Company) starring Bradley Cooper as a bad-boy chef took in about $5 million according to Rentrak which compiles box office data. “Burnt” cost a little under $20 million to make.“Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse” (Paramount Pictures) which cost roughly $15 million collected $1.8 million; several theater chains refused to play the horror movie after Paramount announced plans to rush it to video-on-demand systems.

9,This evening Mr. Hinson said "we agree with the thrust of the recommendations."The safety board also said oxidizers the class of chemicals that includes the oxygen generators in the Valujet crash should not be transported in cargo compartments that lack smoke or fire detectors; Mr. Hinson responded that his agency had already begun a review of how oxidizers are shipped. The safety board is an independent agency chartered by Congress to make recommendations to regulatory authorities at all levels of government. The F.A.A. usually but not always follows the recommendations; for example the safety board noted in the letter today that it had previously called for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers for cargo holds but that the aviation agency decided against such precautions.The letter said a Pan Am Boeing 707 cargo plane crashed in November 1973 at Logan International Airport in Boston because of a fire started by materials that were improperly packaged. In addition it cited a DC-10 parked at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago was destroyed by a fire after a technician mishandled an oxygen generator and an an American Airlines DC-9 had a fire in midflight in February 1988 because of unlabeled hazardous materials. That plane landed safely.The letter said that the cause of the Everglades crash was still under investigation but that there might have been as many as 144 oxygen generators on board which "created an extremely dangerous condition." They had been shipped without the protective caps that block them from being set off the board said.The generators had been removed from other Valujet planes by a contractor after their shelf life had expired but they had not been "fired" meaning that the oxygen-producing chemical reaction had not been set off. Such a step would have changed the generators from a hazard capable of starting fires to a chemical compound that can no longer burn or explode. It is mildly hazardous because it includes toxic barium salts but it is enclosed in a stainless-steel canister.Valujet and a contractor that had removed the generators from other Valujet aircraft Sabretech have publicly disagreed over whose fault it was that the generators were not fired.

1,As the search for causes of the financial crisis continues in Washington one economist Russell Roberts of George Mason University says he believes that it was inept government policy not Wall Street greed that allowed the financial system to spin out of control.Mr. Roberts who follows the free-market Hayek school of economics argues in a new paper that almost any attempt to reform the nation’s financial regulatory structure will fail to prevent another crisis as the government will continue to limit the downside risk to both Main Street and Wall Street encouraging reckless behavior.He contends that the government has put in place a system in which it is easy to gamble with other people’s money — particularly borrowed money — by making sure that almost everybody who makes bad loans gets their money back.“The financial crisis of 2008 was a natural result of these perverse incentives” Mr. Roberts argues in his paper “Gambling With Other People’s Money: How Perverted Incentives Caused the Financial Crisis.” He asserts that “we must return to the natural incentives of profit and loss if we want to prevent future crises.”Mr. Roberts argues that public policy decisions have perverted the incentives that naturally create stability in financial markets and the market for housing by subsidizing losses for bondholders and homeowners respectively. He believes that over the last 30 years government policy has “coddled creditors” reducing the risk they face from financing bad investments.While he says that Wall Street was not blameless in this system as bankers lobbied for polices that created the problem it was the government’s track record of riding to the rescue of investors that allowed them to take far greater risks than they normally would have if they thought they could lose nearly everything.For example Mr. Roberts argues that the government policy to push for greater home ownership led to a chain of events in which unqualified borrowers were getting mortgages for houses they could never afford.The banks wrote the mortgages to sell to investors who in turn sold them off to government-backed entities Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Without such entities lending standards would have been stronger.The public jumped on the housing bandwagon as investors. For no money down thanks to changes in government policy people could buy real estate with little downside risk. If they could not pay their mortgages they could always walk away from their homes with little loss.The same can be said for large investors. From the Mexican peso crisis in 1995 to the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998 and the fall of Bear Stearns in 2008 the government stepped up with plans to help large institutional investors from losing money.While equity holders bear the risk of profit and loss Mr. Roberts argues that bondholders have little downside risk thanks to government intervention.This supposed preference for bondholders helped Freddie and Fannie attract billions of dollars from small and large investors which in turn financed the housing boom as it allowed these government-sponsored enterprises to buy up all those bad mortgages.If Fannie’s and Freddie’s bonds reflected their true risk they would never have been bought up by the Chinese government or small investors Mr. Roberts contends adding that the government just made things worse when it moved in to secure the two mortgage giants in the fall of 2008.By not letting the bondholders bear some loss Mr. Roberts argues the government just made the system riskier.The one case in which the government did not come to the rescue involved Lehman Brothers. While some people believe that the failure of such an interconnected investment bank was a main reason that the financial crisis accelerated Mr. Roberts sees it differently.It was the shock of a possible change in government policy to bail out troubled bondholders not the collapse of Lehman that sent the markets into a tailspin.When the market thought the government would not bail out other companies from that point onward investors began pulling their money out of the system Mr. Roberts noted.It was not until the government signaled that it would not let any other major financial firm fail that the markets started to normalize.So-called moral hazard is therefore deeply rooted in the investing world. As such Mr. Roberts contends that Wall Street is nothing more than a giant government-sanctioned Ponzi scheme.“Rescues have distorted the natural feedback loops of capitalism” Mr. Roberts wrote. “Rescuing rich people from the consequences of their decisions with money coming from average Americans is bad for democracy.”In the end Mr. Roberts argues that financial regulatory overhaul will fail to prevent future crises with investors — homeowners bondholders or Wall Street bankers — continuing to count on the government to bail them out if anything goes wrong.While some believe more regulation is needed Mr. Roberts argues that it was government intervention in the markets that created the crisis and that less not more regulation is what the system needs to heal and to survive.— Cyrus SanatiGo to Research Paper from Russell Roberts of George Mason University (pdf) »
1,Work-life balance was a term not yet coined in the years my children were young; it is aptly descriptive of the time distribution I experienced. My success in law school I have no doubt was in large measure because of baby Jane. I attended classes and studied diligently until 4 in the afternoon; the next hours were Jane’s time spent at the park playing silly games or singing funny songs reading picture books and A. A. Milne poems and bathing and feeding her. After Jane’s bedtime I returned to the law books with renewed will. Each part of my life provided respite from the other and gave me a sense of proportion that classmates trained only on law studies lacked.Image Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her chambers on Friday August 23 2013. Credit... Todd Heisler/The New York TimesI have had more than a little bit of luck in life but nothing equals in magnitude my marriage to Martin D. Ginsburg. I do not have words adequate to describe my supersmart exuberant ever-loving spouse. Early on in our marriage it became clear to him that cooking was not my strong suit. To the eternal appreciation of our food-loving children (we became four in 1965 when our son James was born) Marty made the kitchen his domain and became chef supreme in our home.Marty coached me through the birth of our son he was the first reader and critic of articles speeches and briefs I drafted and he was at my side constantly in and out of the hospital during two long bouts with cancer. And I betray no secret in reporting that without him I would not have gained a seat on the Supreme Court.Ron Klain then associate White House counsel said of my 1993 nomination: “I would say definitely and for the record though Ruth Bader Ginsburg should have been picked for the Supreme Court anyway she would not have been picked for the Supreme Court if her husband had not done everything he did to make it happen.”That “everything” included gaining the unqualified support of my home state senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and enlisting the aid of many members of the legal academy and practicing bar familiar with work I had done.I have several times said that the office I hold now for more than 23 years is the best and most consuming job a lawyer anywhere could have.The court’s main trust is to repair fractures in federal law. Because the court grants review dominantly when other jurists have divided on the meaning of a statutory or constitutional prescription the questions we take up are rarely easy; they seldom have indubitably right answers. Yet by reasoning together at our conferences and with more depth and precision through circulation of and responses to draft opinions we ultimately agree far more often than we divide sharply.

8,It took years of legislative debate and judicial inquiry to define and develop today's laws of abortion and artificial insemination. The issues and dimensions of surrogacy are still evolving but it is necessary that laws be adopted to give our society a sense of definition and direction if the concept is to be allowed to further develop. With an increasing number of surrogate births legislation can avoid harm to society the family and the child. . . . Many questions must be answered; answers must come from legislation. If there is no law then society will suffer the negative aspects of this alternative reproduction vehicle that appears to hold out so much hope to the childless who make up a substantial segment of our society. $ ? * * *The four experts called by the parties both hypothetical and clinical all conclude that Mrs. Stern has multiple sclerosis - albeit in a mild form and the possibility of progression is limited to unknown. $ ? * * *With regard to Mrs. Stern's disease all the experts called on this issue conclude that her decision not to become pregnant in light of her knowledge of her disease her experienced symptomology the accepted medical understanding of the medical profession at the time that risk of exacerbation was attendant to pregnancy was a medically reasonable and understandable decision. * * *It is argued that the child will not be protected. So long as there is no legislation and some court action in surrogacy arrangements is required the child born of surrogacy will be protected in New Jersey. If there is compliance with the contract terms adoption will be necessary; hence court inquiry about best interests must take place. If there is noncompliance with the contract as in this case best interest is still litigated with protection to the child. * * *The second argument against surrogacy is that the surrogate mother will be exploited. To the contrary. It is the private adoption that has that great potential if not fact for the exploitation of the mother. In the private adoption the woman is already pregnant. The biological father may be unknown or at best uninterested in his obligation. The woman may want to keep the child but cannot do so for financial reasons. There is the risk of illegal consideration being paid to the mother. In surrogacy none of these ''downside'' elements appear. The arrangement is made when the desire and intention to have a family exist on the couple's part. The surrogate has an opportunity to consult take advice and consider her act and is not forced into the relationship. She is not yet pregnant.

1,How can I get tickets to the Olympics? Is it too late?The first round of Tokyo Olympics ticketing was limited by lottery system to residents of Japan and closed on May 28. A subsequent “relief measure” lottery was held in August. Paralympic tickets were also awarded on a lottery basis and closed on September 9.Thirty percent of an estimated 7.8 million have been set aside for overseas visitors sold by “Authorized Ticket Resellers.” For those in the United States ticket sales will be handled by CoSport and went on sale in July. As of this writing all available tickets have been sold although subsequent rounds of ticketing are expected to take place on an ongoing basis through 2020 before the start of the Games.The Tokyo Olympics organizing committee will also host an online resale site beginning in the spring with ticket prices capped at the original face value. Available for both foreign visitors and Japanese residents the official resale service may provide relief for those shut out of the initial rounds of ticketing.What happens if I can’t secure any tickets at all?Lack of tickets does not necessarily mean a lack of Olympics fun in and around Tokyo. The organizing committee has approved 30 “Live Site” venues across Japan for non-ticketholders including in areas affected by the Tohoku and Kumamoto earthquakes. These sites will feature live televised sports broadcasts cultural events and among other programs attendee s will have the chance to try out various Olympic and Paralympic sports.Is it true that I won’t be allowed to post photos of events to social media?Shortly after the first round of tickets went on sale in Japan controversy arose over certain aspects of the terms and conditions attached to the purchase of tickets namely the transfer of intellectual property rights of photos taken by attendees at Olympic events to the organizing committee. Would this mean then that the Committee — notorious for protecting its I.P. rights — would then crack down on social media photos?Organizers have clarified that while the Committee is in fact claiming copyright over photos taken by ticketholders it will not prevent those photos from being posted to social media. Only commercial reproduction of photos will be disallowed. Controversially however audio and video clips taken by spectators are not permitted to be posted on social media. Organizers are expected to be vigilant in filing takedown notices with social media networks.

6,A committee of creditors of the John David Company Inc. met all day yesterday with officials of the retail menswear chain at its New York headquarters.It is understood that John David owes its trade creditors some $1 million. The company also has about $750000 debentures outstanding.The conference was held in an attempt to unravel recentlytangled financial affairs of John David which operates four stores in Manhattan one in White Plains and another in Washington D.C.For about two months rumors that John David was for sale or in serious financial straits were heard in the menswear market.
0,Played six days before the SEC and Big 12 meet in the national championship the Cotton Bowl may give fans a glimpse of what lies in store for Florida and Oklahoma. On one side we have Ole Miss — the only team to beat Florida during the regular season. On the other high-flying Texas Tech’s offensive philosophy provides a similar picture to Oklahoma though more skewed towards the passing game. The same questions exist here as do in the B.C.S. national championship game: Can Texas Tech control the Ole Miss front seven? Can the Ole Miss secondary contain Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree? And like the national title game the Cotton Bowl is expected to be a good one.The Cotton Bowl: Friday Jan. 2 at 2 p.m. in DallasMississippiWhat a difference a year makes for the Rebels who ended last season on the lowest of low notes (blowing a 14-0 lead in the Egg Bowl). What a difference a new coach makes as well. Houston Nutt has reversed the losing trend developed under Ed Orgeron who led the Rebels to only 10 wins over three seasons. Few bowl teams finished the regular season hotter than Ole Miss which won its final five games to finish 8-4 its best record since the Eli Manning-led 2003 team went 10-3. The Rebels’ quarterback is the Texas transfer Jevan Snead who was terrific in his first year as the starter. He threw 15 touchdowns against only 2 interceptions during Mississippi’s five-game win streak. End Greg Hardy and tackle Peria Jerry combine to give Ole Miss one of the most formidable defensive lines in the country.Texas TechBecause of the hullabaloo about who was left out of the title game you tend to forget about the teams who were left out of the B.C.S. entirely. Texas Tech along with Boise State is a team with a genuine B.C.S. resume (a 39-33 win over then-No. 1 Texas for starters) which found itself on the outside looking in. The Red Raiders are the only one-loss team from a B.C.S. conference left out. Of course the reason Tech is in the Cotton Bowl and not say the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl was the 65-21 trouncing dropped on it by Oklahoma which did irreparable damage to its national standing. Word of the wise to the Red Raiders: Sleep on this game don’t come to play and Ole Miss will be only too happy to take full advantage. Thinking outside the box keep an eye on (if you can find him) the diminutive receiver Eric Morris who finished second on the team with eight receiving touchdowns. Morris makes Wes Welker another undersized Tech receiver look like Randy Moss.Mississippi Bowl HistoryRecord: 19-12Last appearance: 2004 Cotton Bowl vs. Oklahoma State (W 31-28)Texas Tech Bowl HistoryRecord: 10-20-1Last appearance: 2008 Gator Bowl vs. Virginia (W 31-28)Cotton Bowl HistoryFirst played in 1937Last year: Missouri 38 Arkansas 7Bowl Pick ‘EmPete: Mississippi. Will this game offer any clues to how Florida will do against Oklahoma?Thayer: Texas Tech. New question that Rebels Coach Houston Nutt can ask his team next season: “How many have won a bowl game before?”Paul: Texas Tech. But the Ole Miss front four is going to give Tech fits.Fred: Texas Tech. Love the Red Raiders and love Mike Leach. This is one of the more intriguing non-B.C.S. bowl games. I just think Texas Tech has too much offense.Connor: Texas Tech. Ole Miss is headed on the right track with Houston Nutt but Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree make the Red Raiders too explosive.

0,The questions hung heavily in the air and then seemed to fill the room.Daniel R. Coats the former Republican senator from Indiana had been summoned to a suite at the Madison Hotel near the White House by President-elect George W. Bush and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney for an audition of sorts for the job of secretary of defense advisers to the participants recalled.And in the midst of their 45-minute conversation on Dec. 18 the two auditioners began to ask themselves whether Mr. Coats was up to the job of running the world's largest corporation or whether there was a stature gap.Could a former lawmaker who had been a top aide to Dan Quayle when he was a congressman go mano a mano with Colin L. Powell a four-star general who had served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had run the war that ousted Iraq from Kuwait had flirted with running for president and was now poised to become secretary of state?Or would he turn out to be Aspin redux a figure like the Clinton administration's first defense secretary Representative Les Aspin who was well liked and respected as a brilliant mind on defense matters but who was widely viewed by White House and Pentagon officials at the end of his tenure as an indecisive and ineffective manager who lost President Clinton's confidence and had to resign?
9,The council was formed during the campaign to help Mr. Dinkins to deal with the budget deficit.''Expanding it is one of the things I want to do rather early on'' Mr. Dinkins said of the panel. ''For instance there are no women on it.''Mr. Dinkins said he may also announce more appointments within the next two days. So far about half of the top government jobs have been filled. But Mr. Dinkins said it was unlikely he would immediately appoint people to head the departments of transportation labor and human services.A Few Koch People''We need to look at where we are in the whole search process'' he said. ''We have things in varying degrees of progress in the pipelines. In some instances we may have have a finalist and I have yet to interview him. In other instances the search committees are yet at work not yet fully satisfied that they have exhausted the reservoir.''Until now Mr. Dinkins has generally reached beyond the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch in forming his government. That may change.''There will be one or more Koch people retained'' in high level positions Mr. Dinkins said refusing to provide any names.Mr. Dinkins said he has tried - in his appointments - to live up to a campaign promise of making city government racially diverse.'By God What a Rainbow'''I would hope the first impression one would have when looking at my appointments would be excellence competence'' he said. ''And then 'By God what a rainbow.' ''
1,PhotoAT&T the second-largest wireless carrier in the United States says it is has found life beyond being a phone carrier.The company said that this year it is poised to become a more diversified company with money coming in from connected cars and the “Internet of Things.” AT&T also says that business solutions or services it offers to businesses will be its largest source of income.In an interview Ralph de la Vega the head of AT&T’s mobile and business solutions division shared insight into how the company was finding business beyond offering service for cellphones. The following is an edited version of that interview.Q.You mention that a big part of AT&T’s revenue comes from business solutions. What does that even mean? What’s an example?A.We are an organization that covers more than 120 million wireless subscribers in the United States and 3.5 million and more businesses throughout the world in over 180 countries. And we serve nearly all of the Fortune 1000 companies around the world. We give some great solutions for entertainment or businesses.A good example of a business that has dramatically transformed the industry that’s using those capabilities is Uber. Uber has transformed what it took to hail a taxi completely and does it now via smartphone. We are their primary provider. We were there with them from the very beginning when it was a much smaller company. We provided Uber the phones that they gave to their drivers and we made sure the application was on the phones of course. And we did some of the back-office stuff that they needed us to connect them with.We loved their vision for taking a smartphone putting it in the hands of the driver and the passenger and letting them connect to bring about it a completely new service that quite frankly wouldn’t have been possible.Q.So AT&T keeps saying it’s really bullish about the Internet of Things. Do you really think people are going to care about things like turning on light bulbs with their phones? So far these applications have been perceived as a luxury not a necessity.A.That’s not the definition we see of the Internet of Things. Clearly that’s one of the things you could do but gosh you could do so much more.When we say Internet of Things we say everything from wearables to light bulbs but it includes locomotives jet engines cargo containers cars trucks trains automobiles.I don’t think you’ll see too many things in the future that are not connected. Once you connect those things then it adds huge value for tracking where different pieces of equipment are and their status so businesses can run more effectively.A real-life case is a garbage can. You would say “What in the world are you doing connecting garbage cans?” A waste management company came to us and said: “We don’t know how full they are. If we don’t know how full they are we might pick up bags when they aren’t full.” So as they make the rounds picking up they can say “If they’re not filled we don’t have to pick that one up today we can pick it up next week.” And it saves them time and materials and can even lower prices for customers.So we brought that company and their garbage can to our Foundry our innovation center. We manufactured a piece of equipment there using a 3-D printer. Whether the garbage can was half full or three-quarters full it would send a message to a control center that could also route a person to pick up the garbage.When we say the Internet of Things it encompasses a very wide field.Q.You mentioned wearables. The Apple Watch is coming out in April. What’s your take on smart watches? Will they be as successful as smartphones?A.I think it’s going to be hard to tell. The key with the smart watch is it really has to be smart on its own. I think some of the ones you’ve seen that get us the most excited are those that connect directly to a cellular network. When they are able to stand alone you can leave your smartphone at home while going for a run.Q.I don’t really get the appeal of connected cars. In the car when you’re driving you don’t want to be distracted so why would you need an extra data plan on top of your smartphone plan for a car? Doesn’t that get expensive?A.We are pioneers in the connected-car space and are ahead of our time in spotting the trend that all cars will have connectivity in the future. Car manufacturers all want connectivity because that’s the easiest and fastest way to update the software. The days of having to take your vehicle to a dealer to update maps are long gone.Tesla is one of the more aggressive manufacturers when it comes to updating the software in their vehicles over-the-air which all manufacturers are moving to. When the car breaks down what happens to the car? Did the battery go dead? They can also track the history of what happens to the car for diagnostics.From the user’s point of view there isn’t an autonomous driving vehicle that’s not connected that I know of. How you interact with the autonomous driving vehicle is with a smartphone. All cars will have an autonomous driving feature so you can talk to the car while using your smartphone.We added 800000 connected cars in the fourth quarter of 2014 alone. That is pretty significant.

9,Now that the auto makers are in that box Mr. Bieber clearly relishes keeping them there insisting that they sell all 60000 and create all 15000 new jobs. "By God I'll tell you this we're going to keep tabs of how many are sold there and we're going to remind people of this" he said. Parts Supplier MovementsWhile he does not expect the auto makers to move assembly plants to Mexico overnight Mr. Bieber said he thought they would begin pushing their parts suppliers to relocate there in pursuit of lower-cost labor.In a recent interview at Solidarity House the U.A.W.'s headquarters here Mr. Bieber reflected both on his recent defeat on the trade agreement and on what most auto analysts regard as his recent victory over the Big Three in national labor contract negotiations. As he spoke about the future of labor and of his union -- whose diverse but declining membership includes not only auto workers but state employees and jai alai players -- he adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Mr. Clinton whose support he acknowledged he needs to fulfill a broad legislative agenda."I have great respect" Mr. Bieber allowed with the faintest of grins "for his ability to get people to vote his way."Indeed Mr. Bieber has not taken the big picture of him with Mr. Clinton off his office wall despite the irony that the President's scribble has acquired since the trade agreement vote: "with thanks for all your help.""We worked hard in 1992 to help elect Bill Clinton President of the United States" Mr. Bieber said. "I have no regrets." Fourth and Final Term at U.A.W.At 65 Mr. Bieber a hulking man and a tenacious bargainer is serving his fourth and final term as U.A.W. president. He will retire in 1995 ending a career with the U.A.W. that began in 1949.
8,AROUND THE WORLD; Nuclear Powers Urged To Forgo 'First Use'MOSCOW Sept. 30 (Reuters) - A group of Soviet and British political and military experts called on nuclear powers today to follow the Soviet lead in pledging not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and recommended that the principle be extended to include conventional arms.Members of the group which included Field Marshal Lord Carver and Gen. Konstantin Mikhailov said at a news conference that both sides felt urgent steps were needed to counter a growing threat of nuclear war.The group's three-day talks in Moscow were the third in a series of so-called ''Edinburgh conversations'' between Soviet and British experts on the danger of a new war. It was the first such meeting held in the Soviet capital.GENEVA Sept 30 (Reuters) - The United States and the Soviet Union resumed talks today on reducing the number of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.

1,LOS ANGELES — “Victory!!!”With that single aggressively punctuated tweet Phillip Iscove a creator of the Fox drama “Sleepy Hollow” summed up what Hollywood writers seemed to be feeling on Tuesday after a middle-of-the night deal between studios and writers to avert a strike.Conspicuously not doing a victory lap was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers which bargains on behalf of studios.A tentative agreement for a new three-year master contract with the producers’ alliance and unions representing more than 12000 television and movie writers was reached at around 1 a.m. on the West Coast. The previous contract expired at midnight and the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East had vowed to go on strike as early as Tuesday morning. A walkout would have immediately sent late-night comedy shows into reruns and threatened important presentations planned by ABC CBS Fox and NBC to attract advertising.The unions declared in an email to members that they had won “unprecedented gains.” Leaders added: “Did we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild’s members $130 million more over the life of the contract than the pattern we were expected to accept.”

6,JOSEPH SCHMIDT: tenor (Capitol T 10367). The extraordinarily brilliant tenor voice of the diminutive Joseph Schmidt (1904‐42) is heard here in the music he waa forced to sing because he was less than 5 feet tall. Because he could not appear successfully on the opera stage radio became his only outlet and this disk's selections —popular German songs and excerpts from films and operettas from the tenor's days with the Berlin radio in the 1930's—not only furnish examples of the radiant voice but are also a documentaryof German popular music before the Second World War. There is no depression reflected in the gay tunes and waltzes nor much originality. The album is chiefly recommended for those interested in freak voices of phenomenal range andbrilliance.

8,The American Embassy is not sure whether it ever issued a visa to Col. Gregorio Honasan the fugitive leader of last month's attempted coup. But just to be on the safe side it has canceled any such visa he may have.The cancellation widely publicized here was the latest gesture by the United States to reaffirm its support for the Government and quell continuing rumors that it may somehow have been involved in the unsuccessful coup.America's influence in the Philippines - and an often exaggerated sense of that influence - grows out of the former colonial relationship between the two nations and leads to sometimes delicate byplay between the embassy and the Philippine public.The first of the recent gestures came in the early hours of the uprising Aug. 28 when the Government appeared to be in peril and the embassy scrambled to issue a statement of support for President Corazon C. Aquino. Ambassador Newly Arrived
7,Thailand's decision to send volunteer ground forces as well as gunboats and other military aid to Pnom penh may in the short run bolster the shaky Lon Nol regime and help to speed the promised withdrawal of American forces from Cambodia this month. In the long run however this latest extension of the Indo china conflict is more likely to add to the problems of the Cambodians—and the Thais—and to complicate the task of extricating American forces from South east Asia.The Thai move is almost certain to provoke a reac tion from Communist forces already operating inside Thailand and along the long porous Thai border with Laos. It could in time lead to a more substantial extension of the Indochina war to Thailand itself.For the Cambodians this fresh promise of “help” from another traditional foe is at best a doubtful blessing even though it is accompanied by assurances that the helpers will all be Thais of Cambodian descent. The Thai move means a further intensification of the fighting on Cambodian soil with all the destruction and loss of civilian life that entails. It will add weight to the nationalist appeal of ousted Prince Sihanouk who has alrerady gained recruits for his Communist backed fight to regain power as a result of South Vietnam's heavy‐handed intervention on behalf of the Lon Nol Government.It could even lead to the dismemberment of Cam bodia with the Thais indefinitely occupying western areas of the country some of which they have long claimed; with the South Vietnamese taking over effec tive control in the southeastern region where their forces are operating and with Communist forces hold ing firm in the northeast where they are entrenched.

9,BEYOND UHURA "Star Trek" and Other Memories. By Nichelle Nichols. Putnam $22.95.Nichelle Nichols best known as the communications officer on the Starship Enterprise on "Star Trek" has written a monotonous memoir in "Beyond Uhura." Her narrative begins with her 19th-century ancestors continues with her Midwestern childhood and concludes with the twilight of her "Star Trek" career. But there is little more here than endless brushes with greatness and repetitious hosannas to her onetime lover Gene Roddenberry the producer and creator of "Star Trek." And that's a pity because to read between the lines of "Beyond Uhura" is to uncover the story of a competent performer entangled in a capricious profession and its exclusionary and often humiliating practices. Ms. Nichols has some good stories to tell but she fails to engage. TONI L. KAMINS

1,PhotoEarly in “Being Flynn” the new movie directed by Paul Weitz Jonathan Flynn slides behind the wheel of a yellow cab as his voice on the soundtrack gives vent to a barrage of misanthropy. It is hard for a movie lover not to detect a wink in this otherwise perfectly ordinary scene since Jonathan is played by Robert De Niro the most famous taxi driver in movies. “Being Flynn” is a much milder movie than “Taxi Driver” pursuing intimate themes rather than big ideas but Jonathan Flynn and Travis Bickle are linked by the discrepancy between self-image and reality and also by Mr. De Niro’s gift for portraying alienated men at odds with themselves.He has not done much of that lately. Moviegoers too young for “Taxi Driver” or “Raging Bull” know him as the comically menacing patriarch of the “Meet the Parents” movies the last of which was directed by Mr. Weitz. And while his performance as Jonathan Flynn strays now and then into histrionics (not without reason) it also provides a reminder of what a resourceful unpredictable and subtle actor Mr. De Niro can be.Jonathan runs on vodka orange juice bile and delusions of grandeur. He is a writer and in his own estimation one of only three in American letters worth bothering with the other two being Mark Twain and J. D. Salinger. His own shaggy rambling manner and his shabby circumstances suggest Charles Bukowski but with more blarney and less compassion. “We are put on this earth to help other people” is his motto but in practice it seems to mean that everyone else on earth should either see to his needs or leave him alone.Jonathan is not the only Flynn or the only writer in “Being Flynn.” The movie is equally the story of his son Nick who grew up with his mother (Julianne Moore) and the legend of his absent dad. Jonathan served time in federal prison for passing bad checks writing letters to Nick that fed the boy’s literary ambition but even after release never showing up in person. In his 20s Nick played by Paul Dano starts working at a homeless shelter where Jonathan after losing his apartment and his job happens to take up residence. The two of them establish a difficult painful and ambiguous connection. The real Nick Flynn wrote about this in a memoir with a title too pungent and profane for me to repeat here. Mr. Weitz whose adaptation has been approved by Mr. Flynn has softened and streamlined the story but his desire to retain some of the book’s candor and poetry is evident. Sometimes awkwardly and sometimes gracefully “Being Flynn” charts a middle course between the rough honesty of its source and the sentimental triteness of the much worse movie it could have been.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe melodrama of parent-child reconciliation of redemption and recovery and hard lessons tenderly learned is a staple of movies and television and the magnetic pull of that therapeutic genre is hard to resist. It is to Mr. Weitz’s credit that he tries. He does not force Jonathan and Nick into teary embraces or ringing speeches but rather lets Mr. Dano and Mr. De Niro find their own rhythms which don’t always harmonize. Mr. Dano is a quiet inscrutable presence but has an odd charisma a blend of sensitivity and bottled-up rage that makes him an intriguing foil for Mr. De Niro as he was for Daniel Day-Lewis in “There Will be Blood.”Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Jonathan certainly knows how to call attention to himself. Nick is more diffident and watchful and it is easier to sympathize with someone tormented by the death of his mother and the toxic legacy of his father’s neglect. He has his own self-destructive patterns of behavior but these are examined more superficially than his father’s which is too bad.
6,The San Diego Chargers subpar physically for five weeks have become something less than the awesome defending champions of the American Football League.A succession of injuries to such key performers as Lance Alworth Paul Lowe Ron Mix Keith Lincoln and Dick Harris has brought the West Coast juggernaut to a standstill. After three league games the Chargers show a record of one victory and two defeats.However unfortunately for the New York Jets most of the Chargers are expected to be in excellent health when the clubs clash in Shea Stadium Saturday night.That was the message delivered by Bob Burdick San Diego's advance man at the Jets' weekly luncheon yesterday. Of particular interest to Week Ewbank the Jets' coach was Burdick's report on Harris the defensive back who specializes in harassing receivers.

1,New York smells like many things and some of them are good: freshly baked bagels a beer and a dog at Yankee Stadium the salt air that blows in on a summer morning.Of course many New York smells are not so good. Feel free to think of some of your own least favorites.Though you would probably be hard pressed to come up with an official scent of New York a state legislator from Staten Island Matthew Titone thinks he has: pine.Uli Seit for The New York TimesIn a press release on Friday (and yes we realize it was April Fool’s Day and the assemblyman’s office swore this was not a joke) Mr. Titone introduced legislation that would name pine as New York’s official state scent. He said that while New York had the usual official flower tree bird fish and whatnot we did not have a state scent. “And that stinks” he said.Mr. Titone acknowledged that each New York community had its own smells saying that his Staten Island constituents occasionally had to endure the odors of New Jersey. In choosing pine however he said he had found a unifying scent for the state citing the pine barrens of Long Island the Adirondack forests and taxi air fresheners as his influences.“The pine tree like New Yorkers who are known for their can-do attitude takes root where it can” Mr. Titone said in the release “surviving and thriving.”Readers we put it to you: Do you support Mr. Titone’s choice or do you have your own ideas of what should be the state’s official scent?

8,Although the United States economy still ranks as the most productive in the world Japan and other competitors are mounting a strong challenge in a number of fields including high technology automobiles and textiles.In the view of many members of both Government and industry one factor holding back the United States is its stiff antitrust laws. ''There's no question we are becoming less competitive because of our antitrust laws'' maintains D. Bruce Merrifield Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Productivity Technology and Innovation.In their view it is time to make changes in the nation's antitrust laws so that American corporations like their overseas rivals can work together without being hampered by rules prohibiting such collaboration. Congress is already considering legislation that would ease such industry cooperation.Opponents doubt the efficacy of such legislation however and suggest that liberalization of antitrust laws to facilitate research might lead to abuses in other areas.
0,Before Chrysler can start building cars that more Americans want to buy it will have to overcome considerable challenges The New York Times’s David E. Sanger writes.The biggest may be persuading its three principal new owners — the retiree benefit fund for the labor union that President Obama himself has identified as a contributor to the company’s decline; a government that insists it will keep its hands off day-to-day decisions; and a foreign car company Fiat — to innovate in ways the carmaker has resisted for three decades.There is reason for skepticism. For all the optimism expressed by the administration about a downsized leaner Chrysler the structure of the new Chrysler sets the stage for a conflict between current workers and retirees.Chrysler’s workers of course are desperate to preserve their job security their wages and their generous health care benefits built up over years of negotiations. But it is Chrysler’s retirees who will hold a seat on the new company’s board representing the interests of a dwindling — and expensive — retirement health plan.“There’s a potential conflict there absolutely” one of Mr. Obama’s aides conceded Thursday The Times said.The innovative element of the new company is supposed to come from Fiat the Italian automaker that managed a remarkable turnaround in the last five years. Fiat turns out fuel-efficient engines and sporty economical small cars — exactly the image of the future American car industry that Mr. Obama talks glowingly about.But when Chrysler was controlled by Daimler-Benz one of Europe’s most successful luxury carmakers everyone hailed the potential of great crossborder synergies. They simply never materialized.Members of the team that negotiated the deal insisted on Thursday that they had explored all those risks as they revamped Chrysler and faced down a group of recalcitrant lenders who on Wednesday night balked at taking a deal that would give them about 28 cents for every dollar they had lent the company over the years The Times said.The United Automobile Workers will not be managing the company the way unions tried and failed to manage United Airlines they said. Moreover Fiat is not Daimler — it is geared toward small midmarket cars not fine driving machines with wood-burl dashboards they added.Mr. Obama is trying to portray the government’s role as more venture capitalist than manager.“I’m not an auto engineer” the president declared Wednesday evening during the news conference marking his 100th day in office. “But I know that if the Japanese can design an affordable well-designed hybrid then doggone it the American people should be able to do the same.”In fact in Chrysler’s case he is relying on Italian technology — Fiat technology — to do what Chrysler has been unable to do itself. And while the White House doesn’t want to advertise that fact as Chrysler embarks on its latest last chance the plan is for Chrysler to ultimately be a subsidiary of Fiat in a turnabout of fortune like those in the early days of the auto industry when giants were consumed by faster-moving competitors.The plan announced Thursday creates incentives for Fiat to obtain a majority share of its troubled American partner step by step. Fiat’s stake is supposed to rise in 5 percent increments if it satisfies each of three milestones: It must expand Chrysler’s market beyond North America by putting Chrysler’s popular Jeeps on car lots in places like Brazil and Italy; it must begin to produce high-performance engines in old Chrysler factories; and it must produce a car that can get 40 miles to the gallon.The entire venture will be overseen by a new board including four directors appointed by the president — some of whom it appears have already been approached about the job.Mr. Obama insists that beyond appointing those directors — mostly “experienced C.E.O.’s” one administration official told The Times — Washington will keep its hands off. But he cautioned that “every dime of new taxpayer money will be repaid before Fiat can take a majority ownership stake.”That “new money” amounts to about $8 billion in loans including the cash to pay off Chrysler’s lenders. The federal government has already extended about $4 billion to keep the company afloat in recent months.The plan faces another potential hitch: that 40-mile-a-gallon car according to administration officials probably will not be for sale in the United States until 2012. If the Secret Service can be persuaded Mr. Obama could tool around in it as he campaigns for re-election.That means the government the unions and Fiat must find a way to keep Chrysler afloat for two and a half years in the worst car market in memory and with offerings that Mr. Obama himself described Thursday at the White House as “less popular less reliable and less fuel-efficient than foreign competitors’.” Presumably they will keep that ringing endorsement out of the company’s advertisements.At General Motors the events about to unfold are even more complex. While the United States government will hold only about 7 percent of Chrysler’s shares it will very likely end up with 55 percent of G.M. once the world’s largest carmaker.And while Mr. Obama says he neither wants to dictate car models nor run the companies their success or failure will be viewed rightly or wrongly as his success or failure as the auto executive he says he never wanted to be.Go to Article from The New York Times »

7,THE group which quite naturally receives the greatest amount of assistance from the Algerian Government is their fellow Arab organization Al Fatah which has a recruit ment and propaganda office on Algiers's main street. One poster on the wall shows an American flag with instead of 50 stars one large six‐pointed star and the caption: “The favorite state.” Another poster shows the Star of David with ramifications that make it look like a swastika and the caption: “Nazionism.” There was considerable commotion in the office as young men arrived to offer their services as guerrilla fighters.“We have a reservoir of manpower here” said the spokesman a large florid man named Madhi Saidam. “We have more than we can use.” But at the time Pales tinian manpower was being diverted from its original aim and was fighting the Jordan ian Army a prospect which Algerian volunteers may have found less appealing.If the Palestinians and the move ments from the Portuguese colonies can be said to be in their adolescence the movements from the three Eng lish‐speaking colonies of Rhodesia South Africa and South‐West Africa are still in their infancy. Johnnie Makatini of South Africa's National African Congress summed it up for all three when he said that “so far we haven't fired a shot in an or ganized way. We are faced with the largest colonial population of any country and we are surrounded by colonial powers. We have no friendly borders. We have no trained fighters because the Government always kept indigenous people out of the army away from the guns. Repression is severe. In other countries the death penalty is being abolished in South Africa its use is being increased. In Pretoria a man is hanged every three days. We are not educated. Vorster says it is enough for us to know how to read road signs. We must not be shown the green pastures where we will never graze.”THE liberation movement which might he given the award of “least likely to succeed” is the Movement for the Self‐Determination and Inde pendence of the Canarian Archipel ago. The Canary Islands are a pros perous tourist paradise off the west coast of Africa where it is balmy all year round. There is no racial prob lem because there is no black popula tion although there are still some 7‐foot‐tall descendants of the Cro Magnon man. On perhaps the pret tiest of the 12 islands Gomera people speak by whistling. One of the princi pal exports is flowers. Revolution there seems as incongruous as revolu tion in Camelot or Brigadoon. And yet in Algiers there is a young lawyer named Antonio Cubillo who is dedi cated to the overthrow of Spanish rule in the Canary Islands. “We may not be black” he told me “but we have an African history and an African personality.”To those who object that “you're too small to be independent” Cubillo points out that nine other African countries are less populated than the Canary Islands and that the Mauri tius Islands although smaller in size are independent. “We could have the highest standard of living in Africa” Cubillo says. “We have universities and cadres. We have one doctor for eight inhabitants. We have the fifth biggest oil refinery in the world 150 to 200 ships call each day to be fueled. We are the biggest exporters of bananas in the world half a million tons each year.”But according to Cubillo the wealth is being siphoned off by the Spanish whose conquest of the is lands goes back to the 15th century and by the more recent plundering of foreign entrepreneurs. “Those damned Swedes” he said “they own the hotels the travel agencies the buses and the night clubs. And all the stores are run by Hindus. They are the first ones we are going to get rid of.”NO matter how bleak the pros pects of some of these groups they can tell themselves that history is on their side in this century of decoloni zation. The domino theory also ap plies to Africa. Each newly independ ent state makes the hold on the remaining colonies more precarious. All the movements share a certain number of assumptions. They all came to recognize the necessity of armed struggle only after a fruitless period of peaceful resistance. Cleaver says: “With us it was the death of Martin Luther King. That exhausted the myth .that you could get what you want without fighting that when the plantation foreman cracks the whip you turn the other cheek.” In South Africa says Johnnie Makatini “it was the same year Albert Luthuli won the Nobel Peace Prize that we opted for violence. On the day he came back from Stockholm Dec. 15 1961 there were explosions all over the country.” In Portuguese Guinea says Joseph Turpin it was after the police killed 50 striking longshore men in Pijiguiti in 1959 that “we decided armed struggle was the only way.”

1,After another wild polling ride in Michigan it is time for a reflection on just how accurate primary and caucus polls have been — both in an absolute sense and as compared with past years. This discussion of course also has implications for the FiveThirtyEight forecast model which is based upon the polls.The short version: the polls have been reasonably good in the last few days before the election. Not perfect by any means — worse than general election polling typically is for example. But no worse and probably somewhat better than in past primaries.In densely polled states — that term importantly would disqualify Colorado — there haven’t been any huge surprises on Election Day itself. If you think it counts as a surprise that Mitt Romney won Michigan by three points when polls showed a rough tie or that Rick Santorum narrowly won Iowa when he was a couple of points back you don’t have a realistic conception of how reliable primary and caucus polling is.On the other hand the polls have been pretty awful at most points prior to about three days before the election seeing surges and momentum shifts that often dissipated.The chart below tracks the error in the polls and compares it to the number of days in advance of the election that they were conducted. The error is measured by looking at how much the polls missed the final margin between the top two candidates. For example if Newt Gingrich beat Mitt Romney by 12 points in South Carolina and the poll called for Mr. Gingrich to win by 5 points instead that would count as a 7-point error. And if the poll had forcasted Mr. Romney to win the state by 5 points instead it would represent a 17-point error.Only the candidates who actually finished in the top two are considered. If an Iowa poll had Mr. Romney in first Ron Paul in second and Rick Santorum in third this method looks only at the difference it showed between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum ignoring the value it had for Mr. Paul. (This is the same technique that I use to calculate my pollster ratings.)On average a poll conducted on the day just before the election has missed the final margin between the candidates by about 4 percentage points. That is reasonably good; the comparable statistic for state polls in presidential general elections is something like 2 or 3 points and primaries and caucuses are much more challenging to poll.However the errors have increased significantly the further you go out. Polls conducted just three days before the primary have missed by an average of about 7 points and those conducted a week out have missed by about 10.And the whole period from about one week to two weeks before the primary has been a disaster with an average miss of about 12 points. That’s just the average not even the worst of it; quite a few polls especially in Florida and South Carolina missed by 20 or more points.Things oddly actually get a bit better when you go further back than that. Polls conducted a month before the primary have missed by an average of about 9 points — actually a bit better than those only a week or so in advance.This could just be a fluke — this looks like a ton of data but almost all of it is from about six states some of which voted at the same time as one another and were subject to the same currents of momentum.With that said if you see a sudden shift in the momentum in a state it’s at least worth considering what the polls had said about the state beforehand. The momentum shifts — at least as measured by the polls — have been very significant in this race and unlike anything we have seen routinely in the past. The problem is that sometimes that momentum has been a false alarm with the polls soon reverting back to form. The exception has been momentum swings in the final few days of the campaign; those usually have held up and have been reflected in the actual results.The FiveThirtyEight forecast model as you might expect has been affected by these quirks. Unlike most of our other forecasting products which tend to blend polls with various types of economic or demographic data our primary forecasts look at polls and polls alone. In fact they double-down on them: the program is designed to place a heavy emphasis on the most recent polls and tries to infer what momentum exists in the race and extrapolate that forward.If you look at how the FiveThirtyEight forecasts have performed on Election Day itself they’ve done pretty well. On average they’ve missed the final margin between the top two candidates by 2.8 points so far.(Note: I exclude Nevada from the calculation although the forecast there was pretty good because we issued that prediction only a day or two before the state voted. We did not issue forecasts thankfully for Minnesota Colorado or Maine since the polling there was thin to nonexistent.)The 2.8-point miss is a fair bit better than how individual polls have done: it is useful to take an average of different surveys on the chance that their errors will cancel out. In addition to taking a simple average however the FiveThirtyEight model also does some more complicated stuff. It weights the polls differently based on their past accuracy and their sample size for instance although in practice this makes very little difference. What does distinguish the FiveThirtyEight model is that it is very aggressive about trying to determine the momentum or trend in the race.This has served the model well on Election Day. By comparison the Real Clear Politics forecasts — which use a perfectly sensible but simpler and more conservative approach — have missed by an average of 4.4 points. Most of the difference comes from Iowa and South Carolina states where there was a very late momentum swing that the FiveThirtyEight model captured more fully.However this aggressive approach has decidedly not paid dividends at earlier periods in these contests when the model made big bets on what turned out to be false starts. On average the forecasts we published one week before each election missed the final margin by an average of 13.8 points.Most of this is just because the polling itself has been inaccurate but the simpler approach used by Real Clear Politics average has done slightly better missing by an average of 12.9 points instead.In addition to comparing the FiveThirtyEight model with its competition however it is also worth looking at the standards it sets for itself. It does not claim to be all that accurate — but is it accurate about how inaccurate it is? (Although this might sound ridiculous it is precisely the kind of thing that forecasters in fields ranging from economics to climate change need to spend more time thinking about.)Our current forecast in Ohio is that Mr. Romney will get 31 percent of the vote there. But the confidence interval attached to the forecast (which represents 90 percent of the possible outcomes) is wide: it ran from 17 points to 42 points. The reason these intervals are so wide is simply because they are built from historical data and this isn’t the first year that polls in primaries and caucuses have missed the mark.What’s been unusual however is the way in which these errors have been related to the timing of the election. In the past polls have gotten somewhat more accurate as we’ve approached Election Day but the improvement has been gradual. This year the polls have gone from quite bad to quite good almost literally overnight — typically about three days before the election.The next chart provides a clear demonstration of this. It compares the actual error in the FiveThirtyEight model at points in time ranging to 25 days before the election against what the model thinks the error should be based on the historical data. Less technically it compares the error in primary polls this year with that of past election cycles.For instance the model is supposed to miss the final margin by about 6 points when it issues a forecast on Election Day. The actual error — 2.8 points — has been much less than that.That’s a good thing right? Well maybe. It probably makes my life easier. In the short term however it is probably just good luck. And in the long term it could imply that the forecasts are underconfident — that the confidence intervals we publish are too wide and reflect more uncertainty about the outcome than there really is.You would have just the opposite discussion of course if you looked at the forecasts we have issued 7 to 14 days in advance. Not only have they been inaccurate but they have been even less accurate than claimed — and we don’t claim they are very accurate to begin with!But this too arguably reflects a certain amount of “luck” (bad luck in this case). Over the whole 25-day period the forecasts have been pretty well-calibrated: it’s just that the “hits” have tended to be concentrated on election night itself and the misses have peaked a week or two beforehand.This need not be so abstract a discussion however. Can we come up with a better explanation than “luck” to describe what we are seeing in the polls?If I had to use a word to describe the behavior of Republican voters so far in this race it would be this one: indifferent. Their preferences between the various candidates have been very weak shifting after seemingly every debate primary and news cycle. Many Republican voters like two or more candidates equally well — or at least see two or more of them as being less bad than the others.To be sure it may also be that the polls are exaggerating this tendency. Most polls now and especially automated polls have very low response rates only getting a small fraction of the people they call to stay on the phone. This may bias the polls in favor of candidates whose voters are most excited about the race on that particular evening. If you called a Rick Santorum supporter the day after Mr. Santorum won Minnesota and Colorado he would probably be giddy and pleased to talk to you — whereas a Mitt Romney supporter would have been despondent and hung up the phone.It is of course a good thing for a candidate to have enthusiastic supporters. But their voters need to be excited at the right time: on Election Day. Thus this tendency to pick up on the most excited supporters may be a boon to pollsters immediately before an election but can make the polls buggy beforehand.I doubt this accounts for all or even most of the momentum shifts we are seeing much of which is probably real but I suspect it accounts for some of it. As I’ve mentioned previously I’d be especially cautious about polls conducted in the 24 or 48 hours after a candidate achieves a big “win” in a primary or in a debate especially if it is an automated survey.And if you’re a Republican voter who does have a favorite candidate I’d be even more cautious. If I were a Mitt Romney supporter for instance I’m not sure I’d be “rooting” for polls that showed Mr. Romney ahead in Ohio right now — something we have not seen yet but may see soon. That could set up exaggerated expectations for Mr. Romney in a state that is ultimately pretty tough for him and where his polls have usually lagged behind his national averages. Then if Mr. Romney goes on to lose the state — and we have seen a number of states revert to the mean implied by their demographics as the election draws near — he could be viewed as “blowing” the lead when he never had a firm grasp on it to begin with.Of course Mr. Romney benefited from this very pattern in Michigan a state where he had a dominant position in the polls until the final two weeks and an underwhelming win looked like a triumph.But if the pattern continues to repeat itself — polls alter and exaggerate expectations for a candidate leading to inevitable disappointment when he does not live up to them — we may see the see-saw patterns of momentum continue in the race.We’re going to continue publishing our forecasts — they are as useful a way to summarize the polls as anything else — but please regard them with caution and remember that those wide confidence intervals are there for a reason.

8,Add Melvin Lowe to the roster of strongmen who have fallen from power in this season of democratic rebirth. Under pressure from a state Supreme Court Mr. Lowe has resigned as chairman of the Student Senate at the City University of New York.The reason: He is no longer a student.Mr. Lowe might have had some reason to start thinking of himself as chairman for life. He was elected three times to the office which carries such perquisites as a seat on the CUNY Board of Trustees a stipend of about $6000 a year and control of a staff and an annual budget of $300000 - activity fees collected from the university's 180000 students and meant to be spent for their benefit. What became unforgivable was Mr. Lowe's behaving like chairman for life. He had to be taken to court for moving the date of new elections from last January to May. And then it emerged that he had not even bothered to register for classes at Hunter College this semester.Mr. Lowe has resigned and dropped from sight. The university has commissioned an audit of Student Senate finances during his tenure. And an interim regime has been installed. It promises new elections in May.

9,More than a month after their homes were destroyed by a devastating earthquake thousands of ill-clad and frightened villagers in the Himalayan foothills still huddle with their cattle for warmth under tents as rain -- snow in the higher mountains -- signals the onset of winter.The survivors have lived in the open since Oct. 20 when an earthquake rumbled across a 70-mile belt in the foothills of the western Himalayas destroying bridges roads and villages.More than 700 people were killed officials at Uttarkashi a major town in the region have said. Relief workers said the number was at least 1500.District Magistrate Sunil Aggarwal said that the crucial factors in the next weeks would be the construction of snow-proof shelters and the providing of relief material including food blankets and medicines to distant villages.

9,Consumers and businesses in New York City are overcharged hundreds of millions of dollars a year because of the grip that organized crime has on the city's vital functions from garbage collection to the wholesale food markets. Thus it is a salutary development that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his administration have begun working with Federal and local prosecutors to do something at last about a huge problem that has long been dismissed as beyond anyone's control.Two events occurred last week that illustrate the city's new aggressive approach. First the Mayor joined with the City Council leadership to support legislation imposing strict rules on four major wholesale produce and meat markets similar to the ones put in place last year at the Fulton Fish Market. Legislation before the Council would give the Mayor authority to require background and fingerprint checks on merchants employees and unions at markets that generated nearly $2.6 billion in sales last year. Second a Federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order sought by commercial garbage haulers against similar background checks and regulation in their industry.Mr. Giuliani who prosecuted many mob leaders when he was a United States Attorney moved to City Hall at a time when many experts had begun to realize that prosecuting individual mobsters was not sufficient to get organized crime out of legitimate businesses. Too often when top crime figures were indicted or convicted they were simply replaced by others who kept the corruption going.The first organized-crime target Mr. Giuliani went after was the Fulton Fish Market where kickbacks and extortion were a way of life. The approach there at first led to protests and job actions that disrupted commerce but the market appears to have returned to normal. The model of requiring background checks and regulating activities at the market was extended to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy and the law requiring similar checks for the carting industry took effect last month.

0,THE REPUBLICANSBOB JONES RESPONDS -- Bob Jones University the fundamentalist Christian institution that has become a lightening rod since Gov. George W. Bush of Texas visited it during the South Carolina campaign has responded on its Web site to attacks against it. The university described Senator John McCain of Arizona Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley as ''the political 'three tenors' '' who together ''sing the same off-pitch tune of the liberal left.'' The university previously declined to respond to requests for comment. ''Isn't it really a compliment to Bob Jones University that the likes of John McCain Al Gore and Bill Bradley seethe and fulminate against us?'' the statement said. The university said its policy against interracial dating was based on its understanding of the story of the Tower of Babel. ''The university wishes to give God the benefit of the doubt and avoid pursuing any direction that would give assistance to the renewed efforts of man to create a one-world community consisting of one religion one economy one government and one race'' the statement said. The university denied that it hates Catholics saying instead it believes it had a biblical mandate to preach salvation by faith alone to Catholics Jews Buddhists Mormons Muslims atheists and ''unbelieving and religiously liberal Protestants.'' The statement said it regarded Catholicism on theological grounds as ''false.'' Gustav Niebuhr (NYT)BETWEEN GOVERNORS -- Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has some neighborly advice for Mr. Bush. Mr. Keating a devout Roman Catholic and early supporter of Mr. Bush has suggested that the Bush campaign schedule a speech at a major Catholic university to counter any hint of anti-Catholic bias that might have emerged after Mr. Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University in the South Carolina primary campaign. Noting that Mr. Bush was at a Catholic center in Cleveland yesterday Ari Fleischer a campaign spokesman said ''We do appearances at faith-based organizations all the time so we rule nothing out.'' Ross E. Milloy (NYT)THE DEMOCRATSGORE IN LOS ANGELES -- Campaigning in Los Angeles today Vice President Al Gore referred only briefly to his rival former Senator Bill Bradley criticizing his health care plan. He had an interview with Univision which he was asked to conduct in Spanish. He declined saying though that he once ''was completely fluent.'' At a fund-raiser where he raised $100000 he paid homage to the ''wonderful mosaic'' in the audience of Indians Pakistanis Jews Koreans and Latinos. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT)THE POLLSOHIO LEANS TO BUSH -- In Ohio the first independent statewide poll of likely Republican voters taken since the primaries in South Carolina and Michigan showed Mr. Bush ahead of Mr. McCain 53 percent to 36 percent. The poll of 386 likely Republican voters questioned on Wednesday through Sunday was released on Tuesday by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati. A similar poll of likely Democratic voters showed Mr. Gore ahead of former Mr. Bradley 66 percent to 22 percent. The margin of error is plus or minus five percentage points. In Maryland another state with a March 7 primary Mr. Bush led Mr. McCain 47 percent to 40 percent in a Potomac Survey Research poll of likely voters for The Baltimore Sun. The poll released yesterday showed Mr. Gore ahead 58 percent to 23 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points. David E. Rosenbaum (NYT)
1,Beltran’s approval to be sent to the Rangers was not required — they were not among the 15 teams to which he could block a trade — but Cashman spoke with him earlier Monday to explain that he wanted to trade him.It is the third time Beltran has been traded at the deadline from Kansas City to Houston in 2004 and from the Mets to San Francisco in 2011 but he is still chasing his first World Series title.According to a person with a team with knowledge of the negotiations with the Yankees there was disagreement between baseball operations and the business side on whether the Yankees would become buyers or sellers. But three consecutive losses — one to Houston and the next two to Tampa Bay convinced the owner Hal Steinbrenner to green light the trades of Miller Beltran and Nova.There was broader agreement on Chapman after he declined to discuss a contract extension.Of the series in Tampa Bay Cashman said: “A true playoff contender not a playoff pretender wouldn’t do that. And that’s been our season a little bit to this date.”Cashman said the Yankees would still be trying to win but acknowledged that they would be evaluating prospects along the way. First baseman Tyler Austin Sanchez and Judge who is expected to be activated Tuesday after missing three weeks with a knee injury could be on their way soon from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and Luis Severino or Chad Green will move into the rotation Wednesday to replace Nova.What it means for the remaining mainstays is uncertain.If Beltran’s trade opened up more time at designated hitter perhaps paving a way back into the lineup for Alex Rodriguez Cashman and Manager Joe Girardi indicated that he would be only one of the options. Rodriguez who is hitting .206 has seen his playing time diminish greatly in the last month. In his lone start in the last 10 days he struck out in all four of his at-bats on Saturday.First baseman Mark Teixeira who said knee surgery was inevitable — be it now in the off-season or beyond that — will continue to play but he is a free agent at the end of the season. Like Rodriguez and the Yankees’ pitcher on Monday C. C. Sabathia Teixeira was an integral part of the last championship team in 2009.
9,Makoto Namba a world-class match racer and an America's Cup skipper who became the first Japanese sailor to break into the top 10 in the world ranking fell overboard during an ocean race on April 23 and is presumed lost at sea off Japan. He was 46.The Japanese Coast Guard conducted an air and sea search for 72 hours to no avail.At the time of the accident Namba was skipper of the 45-foot yacht Escape One which was competing in the Sail Osaka '97 a 1500-mile sailboat race from Hong Kong to Osaka Japan. His team of 12 crew members was leading the 40 boats in the competition said Emili Miura a spokeswoman for the Japanese America's Cup syndicate Nippon Challenge.She said that Namba was steering the boat at dusk when a 20-foot wave crashed into the yacht and pitched him into the water. ''Unfortunately he did not happen to be wearing either a life vest or safety harness'' she said.Namba held on to the boat for a few seconds before losing his grip and disappearing into the high seas and dim light she said. None of the crew members was lost or injured.

1,The Republican National Convention in Tampa Fla. received mediocre television ratings — and the polling data so far suggests that it may produce only a modest bounce in the polls for Mitt Romney.The most favorable number for Mr. Romney is from the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll. That survey showed him pulling into a 3-point lead against President Obama on Saturday. All of the interviews in the Rasmussen poll were conducted after the convention began although only about one-third were conducted after Mr. Romney’s acceptance speech on Thursday night.The Rasmussen poll represents a 5-point swing toward Mr. Romney from the polling firm’s final survey before the conventions when it had Mr. Obama ahead by two points. But it does not read quite as strongly for him as compared to the long-term average of Rasmussen polls which have had Mr. Romney ahead by about one percentage point on average over the past 60 days.Another survey an online tracking poll conducted by the polling firm Ipsos had previously shown a decent-sized bounce for Mr. Romney — but it has since receded some. In the version of the poll that Ipsos released on Saturday Mr. Obama led by one percentage point 44-43 among likely voters. That’s a better result for Mr. Romney than the survey the firm conducted prior to the conventions when Mr. Romney had trailed by four points. But it reflects a reversal from Thursday when Mr. Romney was up by two points in the poll.The most sluggish of the tracking polls is from Gallup which reports its results over a lengthy seven-day window. That means that only about half its interviews occurred after the start of the convention and a smaller fraction than that will represent people surveyed after Mr. Romney’s acceptance address.However the trend so far in the Gallup poll is a bit disappointing for Mr. Romney; the survey still shows Mr. Obama one point ahead. By comparison the Gallup poll has had a 46-46 tie on average over the past 60 days.We’ll need to wait another day or two before we can make a more confident judgement on the size of Mr. Romney’s bounce but the information we have so far points toward its being a little underwhelming.The FiveThirtyEight “now-cast” which does not adjust for the bounces associated with the party conventions estimates that Mr. Obama would have a 72.3 percent chance of winning if the election were held today. That’s essentially unchanged from before the conventions when the number had ranged between about 70 percent and 74 percent.One way to interpret the trend in the “now-cast” is that so far Mr. Romney’s bounce is hard to distinguish from the statistical noise that we ordinarily see in polls. Based on the data that they published on Saturday Mr. Romney’s standing in the Rasmussen poll was two points better than its 60-day average but it was one point worse than average in the Gallup poll.The FiveThirtyEight forecast which penalizes a candidate in its evaluation of polls conducted just after his party convention interprets the data as being slightly negative for Mr. Romney. On Saturday Mr. Obama’s chances of winning the Electoral College rose to 73.1 percent in the forecast its highest figure since Aug. 16 when it was 73.6 percent.But whatever assumptions you make about a convention bounce it introduces more noise into the polling. Both the forecast and the “now-cast” are therefore likely to be more unstable than usual over the next week or two and they should be interpreted with plenty of caution.If Mr. Romney’s bounce turns out to be mediocre the pressure will then be on Mr. Obama. If the polls fail to move much in his direction after the Democratic convention in Charlotte N.C. the gains he has made in the FiveThirtyEight forecast over the past few days will be reversed.
1,Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.In addition to the domestic challenge it presented the fledgling Confederacy posed a foreign policy dilemma for Abraham Lincoln’s administration. The Confederacy hoped to use its position as a crucial source of cotton to secure recognition from foreign powers and boost its legitimacy and it sent commissioners abroad to sway other countries into supporting its cause.In response Secretary of State William Seward threatened war against European countries who interfered in America’s domestic conflict. But the administration wasn’t the only branch to enter the foreign-policy fray: In July 1861 Representative Samuel Sullivan Cox a Democrat from Ohio submitted a resolution calling on Lincoln to share with the House “all correspondence with the English French Spanish and other Governments with reference to the right of blockade privateering and the recognition of the so-called confederate States.” It passed with bipartisan ease as did two more similar resolutions submitted during the following weeks.Lincoln hardly welcomed such extensive oversight; on July 25 the same day that Representative Timothy Howe a Republican from Wisconsin submitted the third of the resolutions the president sent word to the House that the “correspondence called for” would not be forthcoming at that time. The reason for the delay is unclear: of the three resolutions Cox’s mentioned that the correspondence could be submitted “at the beginning of the next session of Congress” and the administration appears to have taken that as an opportunity to wait as long as feasible to release the documents.Eventually however Lincoln complied. In doing so he not only provided his contemporaries and future Americans with an almost real-time detailed look into the daily operations of the country’s foreign policy apparatus in crisis but he set a precedent for State Department transparency that is still followed today.Because the resolutions passed with little or no discussion we have little direct evidence for what Congress was thinking at the time. But we can infer a few things from the broader context. For one such requests were hardly unprecedented: throughout the early republic the legislature had asked for (and the executive branch had supplied) diplomatic instructions and dispatches related to treaties boundary disputes and other foreign affairs. And of course the war made foreign policy an especially touchy subject; by examining the correspondence Congress surely hoped to see that Seward was instructing ministers to appropriately defend American interests and that the ministers were faithfully carrying out the instructions.After months of delay Lincoln finally complied with the resolutions. On Dec. 3 1861 as the second session of the 37th Congress got underway Lincoln sent a message to both houses of Congress. The “message” portion of this communication was quite brief but attached to it was correspondence between the United States and its ministers abroad bound together in one volume (you can read the volume here).Lincoln’s missive opened with a short discussion of foreign relations before turning to other domestic matters. He characterized the Confederate effort to gain recognition from foreign governments as sputtering and unsuccessful noting “the disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected.” After dismissing Confederate diplomatic efforts Lincoln announced that he had submitted the requested correspondence and he hoped that those who read it would see that his administration had “practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign powers averting causes of irritation; and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor.”There followed 425 pages of correspondence between the government and its diplomatic ministers abroad (the United States would not have proper “ambassadors” until 1893). After printing a series of general circulars the volume reproduced material regarding 24 countries: not only the major European powers but most of Latin America and even Egypt the Hawaiian Islands and Japan.The material wasn’t for Congress alone; the White House released it to the public as well. For those who could not get their hands on the volume itself copies of its contents traveled quickly up and down the coast published in newspapers.By perusing the documents Americans could see how the Union defended its interests in countries large and small near and far. Obviously staving off Confederate agents was a key task for America’s ministers. Seward wrote to Carl Schurz the minister to Spain that preventing the Confederacy from gaining recognition was “your chief duty and no more important one was ever devolved by the United States upon any representative whom they have sent abroad.”Even in countries of lesser importance ministers were urged to be on the watch. Although Seward did not believe that the Confederates would attempt to gain recognition immediately from Denmark he wrote to his representative there that “political action even of the more commanding or more active States is influenced by a general opinion that is formed imperceptibly in all parts of the Eastern continent. Every representative of the United States in Europe has therefore a responsibility to see that no effort on his part is wanting to make that opinion just so far as the true position of affairs is in his own country is concerned.”Representatives abroad had an important public relations role to play particularly when news traveled slowly across the Atlantic Ocean and rumors were rife. Seward’s instructions encouraged ministers to not let discouraging news from America cloud foreigners’ perceptions of the war effort. After the First Battle of Bull Run in a letter marked “confidential” he wrote to Charles Francis Adams the minister in London that “you will hear of a reverse of our arms in Virginia” and encouraged him to think little of it. “The vigor of the government will be increased and the ultimate result will be a triumph of the Constitution” Seward wrote. “Do not be misled by panic reports of danger apprehended for the capital.” Seward likewise wrote to William Lewis Dayton in France that “treason was emboldened by its partial success at Manassas but the Union now grows manifestly stronger every day.” Foreigners could get their news from any number of sources and ministers had to stand ready to put a positive spin on events.The volume also exposed domestic readers to the administration’s frustration with the willingness of the British to treat the Confederates as belligerents. This step granted the Confederates some credibility even if it fell short of the full recognition they desired. In these documents Northern readers could see unbiased proof that this action did not go without protest. Adams proclaimed to the British that the Americans were “irritated” by the British treatment of Confederates as belligerents.Slavery is mentioned throughout the volume although at this point in the war the rhetoric was more about the dangers of the political power of Southern slaveholders than the virtues of emancipation. Slavery certainly got credit for causing the war. Seward wrote to Dayton in France that “the attempted revolution is simply causeless. It is indeed equally without a reason and without an object unless it be one arising out of the subject of slavery.” Seward instructed the representative in Russia that although slavery had existed in all the states at the time of the American Revolution “it was expected that under the operation of moral social and political influences then existing the practice of slavery would soon cease.” The “cause” of the rebellion was the fact that the slave states having suffered defeat at the polls in 1860 “took an appeal from the verdict of the people rendered through the ballot-box to the sword and organized a revolution with civil war.”Related Disunion Highlights Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. See the Highlights »The decision to release the material won glowing reviews. The Baltimore Sun reported on Dec. 9 that the correspondence was “receiving that close attention from persons skilled in diplomacy and public law which belongs to its distinguished source and the magnitude of the subject in question.” The Keene New Hampshire Sentinel reported that “in the whole of this correspondence the Secretary of State exhibits marked ability as a statesman and diplomatist.”By January 1862 the correspondence had reached the West Coast; the San Francisco Bulletin reported that the diplomatic correspondence was “quite voluminous” and “highly interesting.” Seward again came in for praise; his “high-toned” and “courteous” messages were “as nearly perfect models of diplomatic correspondence as are to be found on the pages of modern history.” The correspondence with Adams and Dayton “have swept to the winds all the aspersions of those who have accused him of favoring a timid and wavering policy in dealing with the rebels.” The volume attracted attention from abroad as well; shortly after its release Lord Richard Lyons British minister to the United States sent a copy to Lord John Russell the British foreign minister.What can we learn from this volume of foreign affairs documentation released as the first year of the war drew to a close? First it represents what the Lincoln administration wanted the American public to know about foreign affairs (as distinct from telling us in the modern day everything we might like to know about diplomacy during the Civil War). Judging by the newspaper response Americans were pleased with how the federal government was acting. Publishing the documentation also exposed British and French actions toward the Confederates which helped Americans direct their ire toward those two countries.Second the publication of the volume demonstrates the balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches during the mid-19th century: although the executive branch bore responsibility for foreign policy the legislative branch could wield significant power by demanding to see copies of the documentation.Perhaps most importantly the volume illustrates an early attempt at government openness — and given the exigencies of wartime a surprisingly forthright one. The summer resolutions requesting the documents made an allowance for Lincoln’s assessment of the “public interest” in determining which documents not to submit to Congress and we have no way of knowing what type of selection policy was in place. At the same time the resolutions make clear that Congress expected to receive something. Indeed diplomatic correspondence was released to Congress on an ad hoc basis throughout the early republic; but that it was still done in a moment of clear crisis demonstrates that Lincoln’s administration saw the value in getting the correspondence in the public’s hands.There is a final consequence which no one in 1861 could likely have foretold: The State Department continues to publish edited collections of foreign affairs documentation 150 years later. Although the Foreign Relations of the United States series does not release documents as rapidly as Lincoln did and so has become a historical look at American foreign relations rather than a contemporary publication of documents the release of the volume in 1861 set a landmark democratic precedent: that the American government must on a regular basis keep the public informed about its foreign policy operations.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Sources: Congressional Globe; Howard Jones “Blue and Gray Diplomacy: A History of Confederate Foreign Relations”; Roy Basler ed. “Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln” Vol. IV; Message of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the Commencement of the Second Session of the 37th Congress.“Aaron W.

1,EAST RUTHERFORD N.J. — Certain aspects of Sunday’s finale against the Buffalo Bills were uncharacteristic of the Jets this season. For one thing they won 30-10.They ran the ball extremely well and kept quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick on his feet. The defense muffled the typically high-scoring Bills who did not have their starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor and who lost running back LeSean McCoy to an ankle injury in the first half. Cornerback Darrelle Revis the Jets’ marquee player of recent years made his first interception of the season.None of this matched the profile of a team that had underperformed in about every aspect in which performance is analyzed in the sport which is why the Jets had to clarify after the game that Coach Todd Bowles and General Manager Mike Maccagnan would not be fired.That decision was confirmed by a team employee with knowledge of the plans who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Several reporters approached the team owner Woody Johnson after the game to ask whether Bowles and Maccagnan would return for a third season but Johnson walked briskly out of the stadium without commenting.
1,ESPN finally named Dan Shulman Bobby Valentine and Orel Hershiser as its new “Sunday Night Baseball” announcing team Wednesday three weeks after declining to renew the contracts of Jon Miller and Joe Morgan. Hershiser joined Miller and Morgan last season.Valentine the former Mets manager said he was “offered” some managerial jobs in the off-season but did not specify which ones. He interviewed for jobs with the Brewers Mariners and Blue Jays and took himself out of the running for the Marlins’ managerial position.He said that Terry Collins the new Mets manager would be “challenged” by his situation at Citi Field.“I think he’ll also challenge the players” he said during a conference call. “I think it’ll be a work in progress.”Valentine who last season was featured on ESPN’s “Baseball Tonight” program said that he would resist the allure of managing as long as he does well in the Sunday night booth.“It depends if Norby and the crew like what I do and if I continue to get better at what I do and continue to enjoy it” he said referring to Norby Williamson the executive vice president for production at ESPN who assembled the three-man team. Williamson extolled Miller’s and Morgan’s contributions for 21 seasons and simultaneously defended his decision to replace them.“With Dan Orel and Bobby” he said “you not only get an accomplished play-by-play announcer but an accomplished pitcher and an accomplished manager — people who have performed at the highest level of their craft who are conversational and know the sports inside out.”Shulman who has been calling ESPN’s Monday night baseball games recalled during the call how he became a fan when he went to the Toronto Blue Jays’ first home opener in 1977.“I was 10 years old the day the Blue Jays started” he said “and sat in the snow with 45000 other fans.”
0,The real challenge is not to produce books it is to achieve all the goals of publishing -- to get the books edited distributed noticed and above all bought. That is no easy feat: in the United States 150000-160000 new titles were published last year according to R.R. Bowker's Books in Print. On average the P.O.D. titles sell just 150 to 175 copies the companies say. Many authors are happy to pay for 50 or 100 copies of their magnum opus to give or sell to family friends and business contacts. Others though confuse production with publication and end up disillusioned.To address that problem all three companies emphasize marketing promotion and publicity options either bundled into the packages or sold separately as add-ons.The majority of sales of self-published books occurs online. According to Susan Driscoll iUniverse chief executive 40 percent are sold directly to authors and the other 60 percent move through retail channels. John Feldcamp the chief executive of Xlibris like his colleagues maintains that book sales ''are colossally important; they are more profitable than the services.'' But the add-ons generate cash and pull in authors.At iUniverse the ''Star'' program is another important hook. If a title sells more than 500 copies its first year the company may invest in marketing the book and invite the author to become a Star.But of iUniverse's 17000 published titles the authors of only 84 have been chosen as Stars and only a half-dozen have made it to Barnes & Noble store shelves.An exceptional seller is a book like ''The Sweater Letter'' a true-crime story from iUniverse which has sold about 10000 copies. Its author Dave Distel who worked for The Los Angeles Times for 23 years said he ''didn't want to go through the song and dance'' of finding an agent and publisher. But he said he was ''unaware of the stigma'' associated with self-publishing and did not understand that booksellers expect discounts and also expect to return unsold copies. iUniverse worked with him and Mr. Distel said he was satisfied.The fundamental difference between P.O.D. publishers and old-style vanity and subsidy presses is cost. Traditional vanity houses like the 55-year-old Vantage Press charge on average $8000 to $10000 -- and sometimes as much as $50000 -- to produce copies that an author then owns. Subsidy publishers own the copies but give the author a ''royalty'' actually a rebate for each one sold.

8,The specialties of Pizzeria Las Americas 40-05 Junction Boulevard (Roosevelt Avenue) Corona Queens are neither the typical kinds of pizza nor the latest designer styles. They are pizzas with a Hispanic flavor.The sausage pizza is made with chorizo for example. Another is made with ham and pimento and the spicy eggplant pizza comes with a layer of ham. The only variety not made with either ham or chorizo is the onion pizza which does not contain tomato either. A two-crust pizza gallega great to take on a picnic is filled with onions peppers and chorizo.The simple storefront with tables in the rear also sells empanadas of chicken meat or tuna.Pizza prices range from $7.90 to $11.80 for whole pies or $1 to $1.50 a slice. Empanadas are $1 and $1.10 each. Pizzeria Las Americas is open daily from 11:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; 718-478-5040. Adult Peanut ButterAdults - among them William F. Buckley Jr. Malcolm Forbes and Julia Child - are often caught with their fingers in the peanut butter jar. For such people the Peanut Advisory Board has published the ''Adults Only Peanut Butter Lovers Official Cooking Handbook.''The booklet has nine recipes for cookies and one for ice cream and can be obtained by sending a stamped self-addressed business-size envelope to Peanut Butter Cookies Peanut Advisory Board P.O. Box 7528 Tifton Ga. 31793.Here is the recipe for peanut butter shortbread to try while waiting for the booklet:Combine half a cup of softened unsalted butter half a cup of granulated sugar a quarter of a cup of creamy peanut butter and two cups of all-purpose flour in a bowl mixing the ingredients with your fingertips until they become crumbly like coarse meal. Press the mixture into an ungreased eight- or nine-inch round cake pan and with a fork prick lines in the dough to mark wedges.Bake at 300 degrees about an hour until very lightly browned. Cut into wedges when still warm but allow to cool completely before removing from the pan. Once cool the wedges can be embellished by glazing the tops with a melted three-ounce bar of semisweet chocolate. Painless Caramel

0,I plan on drawing the invitation myself with Sissy's help. If a person needs to take a Valium before they come fine. I don't want nobody flipping out. If they feel like they can't handle it they need to leave.And I can't do it on a birthday. Because to me the birthday is the only day worth celebrating really other than Halloween. I'm trying not to go on a day that will make sadness happen in their heads.I would never ever ever ever ever in my life be put in a residential care home a nursing home. You're not even allowed to resuscitate me on the spot. I've got it set up. I'm not going to the hospital. Sorry ain't doing that. No. They strip you of all your dignity and I'm sorry that they do.My training with the elderly and dealing with death gives me a different attitude. I don't look at it as a negative thing. I've had a very interesting life. Life has been an adventure. I don't see why I should have to wither in pain. I've watched people wither in pain. I've bagged and tagged people a lot in my life. That's what we call it bag and tag.In reality I'm not dying any quicker than anybody else -- because you never have more than just this second and that's all you have. It's just right now. And you may be gone. Who knows? You don't have to be ill. A bug comes along and flies through your room and bites you and in a split second you know. Or anything. Walk in front of a car or anything. And that's the way I think about life. So it's a lot easier for me to let go of it because of the way I feel about it I think.If life is a continuum I go to the next step. If life isn't a continuum then what difference does it make?
9,A patient at a state psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane was charged yesterday with strangling his roommate to death with a pair of socks the authorities said.Archie F. Bristol 30 is being held without bail in the Orange County Jail charged with the slaying Friday morning of Anthony Pizzo at the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center in New Hampton about 75 miles northwest of New York City the state police said.The two men had an argument around 7:50 A.M. and had to be separated by hospital personnel the police said.Mr. Pizzo's body was discovered in his room after staff members noticed that neither man had lined up for breakfast roll call.
1,BEIJING — The billionaire founder of JD.com one of China’s largest and most successful online retailers was arrested Friday in Minnesota for alleged sexual misconduct before being released a day later police records show.In a statement posted Sunday afternoon on the Chinese social media platform Weibo JD.com said the executive Liu Qiangdong — who goes by Richard Liu in the English speaking world — had been falsely accused. “During a business trip to the United States Mr. Liu was questioned by police in Minnesota in relation to an unsubstantiated accusation” the company said. “The local police quickly determined there was no substance to the claim against Mr. Liu and he was subsequently able to resume his business activities as originally planned.”Police officials in Minneapolis said they were treating the case as an active investigation.The matter is another unwelcome bit of publicity for a company that symbolizes the business potential of China’s rising middle class. The accusation could also be a test of JD.com’s stability as well as the ability of a Chinese technology company to rebound from the problems of its leaders. China’s most powerful technology companies are still tightly controlled by their founders so the fortunes of businesses worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are closely intertwined with the fates of a small number of executives.JD.com whose shares trade in the United States has prospered by catering to the increasing sophistication of Chinese shoppers. Big global brands such as Nike Prada and Levi’s use JD.com’s sales platform to reach the country’s burgeoning middle class and the company is closely watched as an indicator of consumer confidence.

0,James Blake got his standing ovation last night at Arthur Ashe Stadium. He did not get his upset of Roger Federer the Wimbledon champion.The ovation came when Blake held serve after weathering 8 break points 10 deuces and a great deal of Federer brilliance. It was a remarkable effort and the fans knew what Blake had accomplished as they roared and roared.The rub was that it was only the third game of the second set. Federer can make even straightforward tasks appear difficult for his opponents. And the pressure he applied nearly from the start of this well-attended match at the United States Open eventually wore down Blake the quick and eager American.Blake played well -- superbly at times -- but Federer won this third-round match 6-3 7-6 (4) 6-3.

8,The New York Philharmonic has become the Shirley Verrett Show the last few weeks. Miss Verrett the American soprano sang her own set of concerts for subscription listeners last week and Friday afternoon she replaced another soprano Montserrat Caballe who has been ill and was unable to appear.Aside from accompanying Miss Verrett - which they did very well - Zubin Mehta and the Philharmonic limited themselves to two overtures the Brahms ''Tragic'' (Op.81) and the Szymanowski Concert Overture (Op.12). The Brahms was hard-driven and tensely played while the Szymanowski - given in celebration of the composer's centenary - was notable for its screaming brass great gusting fortissimos and its contrasting string sections which sighed and groaned in their late Romantic splendor. In short it was music supremely loud and enthusiastically vulgar. Both performances were beautifully coordinated and constituted orchestra playing of high virtuosity. Indeed this is music that Mr. Mehta performs perhaps better than any other conductor.Miss Verrett repeated the Chausson ''Poeme de l'Amour'' that she sang last week. She added two arias by Massenet - ''Pleurez pleurez mes yeux'' from ''Le Cid'' and ''Il est doux il est bon'' from ''Herodiade.''Miss Verrett - beautiful as ever and dramatically spotlighted on stage - seemed almost to overstate the case in Chausson's delicately evocative music; but in the two Massenet pieces she was absolutely splendid. The style was grand and the voice equally so. It was one of those instances where virtuoso singing technique and dramatic expression seemed to merge one into the other. The usually subdued Friday audience was loudly enthusiastic at the end.

0,UPDATE: Google has responded again to the firestorm raised by this incident saying it shares the concerns Michael Moore raised in his movie.For a while this weekend it looked like Google had chosen to insert itself in the middle of the national debate over healthcare and take on controversial filmmaker Michael Moore.In an official corporate blog a Google employee criticized Mr. Moore’s movie Sicko as one-sided: “Moore’s film portrays the industry as money and marketing driven and fails to show healthcare’s interest in patient well-being and care” wrote Lauren Turner a Health Account Planner at Google.Ms. Turner went on to suggest that Google could help much-maligned health care companies to “Get the Facts” out. How? By buying ads on Google of course.By Sunday after her post raised some eyebrows in the blogosphere Ms. Turner clarified that the opinion about Sicko was hers not Google’s. “Some readers thought the opinion I expressed about the movie Sicko was actually Google’s opinion” she wrote. “It’s easy to understand why it might have seemed that way because after all this is a corporate blog. So that was my mistake — I understand why it caused some confusion.”A Google spokesman told me much the same.But Ms. Turner also said that she stood by her earlier comments that Google stood ready to help anyone whether the healthcare industry or Mr. Moore’s himself: “Whether the healthcare industry wants to rebut charges in Mr. Moore’s movie or whether Mr. Moore wants to challenge the healthcare industry advertising is a very democratic and effective way to participate in a public dialogue” she wrote.That said it’s not clear that Mr. Moore needs to spend money on Google to get his message out.

7,Governor Carey said yesterday that rents in rent‐controlled or stabilized apartments should be related to the tenants' ability to pay “so that those who need rent control will have it and those who don't need it and can afford higher rents will pay them.”The proposal could mean higher costs for thousands of tenants in New York City and other parts of the state.He announced that he was forming a “task force” to develop a “needs‐based. rent‐control system” as part of efforts to change the present rent laws. Any such system would have to be approved by the Legislature before it could be adopted.The Governor's statements made during and after a meeting of corporate executives and members of the Regional Plan Association immediately drew fire from a major tenants' group but were applauded in varying degrees by real‐estate spokesmen.

0,Andrew H. Walker/Getty ImagesWhat makes a music festival reflect the place where it’s being held? Historically that connection has been key to its success. In the 1960s Woodstock and Monterey Pop crystallized the hippie subcultures of the East and West Coasts. More recently Bonnaroo in Tennessee gives a bucolic home to the jam bands that have always had one foot in Southern rock and Coachella captures the stylish mix of indie rock and dance music endemic to Southern California.What about All Points West? It’s produced by the people behind Coachella and for the last two years the big question has been whether it would have its own distinct character or be merely a smaller imitation of Coachella. (Well the convenience of the ferries may have been a more immediate concern.)In some ways All Points West succeeds beautifully at framing a New York-centric event. Jay-Z was an inspired booking and there is a strain of New York hip-hop historicism running through the lineup with Q-Tip Organized Konfusion and Kool Keith. It’s also not hard to find young New York rock bands: MGMT Vampire Weekend the National. Hip-hop is the exception here however not the rule and for every of-the-moment Brooklyn art-rock band that is NOT on the bill (Animal Collective Dirty Projectors Grizzly Bear) there are another two or three from England or Texas or Sweden. But is that a good thing or a bad thing? New York is cosmopolitan and omnivorous in every way. A festival that reflects our tastes should be like a United Nations of pop music. Right?

9,With prayers and admonitions from Pope John Paul II 238 Roman Catholic bishops from around the world convened today for a synod to study the ''identity crisis'' and ''burnout'' said to be afflicting many of their priests.For the next month the bishops will meet at the Vatican almost daily to examine the selection and training of priests in a church plagued by a serious shortage of clergymen.But church leaders have made clear that a few fundamental aspects of the problem are off-limits to debate notably the Catholic requirement of priestly celibacy and the prohibition against ordaining women and married men. Repeatedly John Paul has left no doubt that these rules will remain intact during his papacy.If anything Vatican officials said the subject of celibacy should arise at the bishops' conference only in the context of how to reinforce the regulation. Their goal would be to help seminary students and priests overcome as one senior official put it ''any hidden frailties poor motivation or deep resistance'' that they may have.

1,Researchers find this kind of unconscious bias almost everywhere. A Stanford study found that teachers reviewing discipline reports in some cases were more likely to favor harsh punishment for a student named “Deshawn” or “Darnell” than one named “Greg” or “Jake.” And black children with appendicitis are less than half as likely to get strong pain medication at an emergency room as white children with appendicitis.Businesses that discriminate seem to hurt themselves but they still do it.Devah Pager of Harvard conducted a study of racial discrimination in New York City in 2004 by sending young black and white men to apply for jobs at 170 businesses bearing fictitious and carefully matched résumés. She found that white applicants were more than twice as likely to get a call back; indeed a white applicant purportedly just released from prison did no worse than a black applicant with a clean record.This year Pager published a follow-up based on what had happened to these businesses in the 2008 recession. She found that the companies that had discriminated were significantly more likely to have gone out of business — which may suggest a price tag for discrimination.Inequities are not just about individual discrimination for the larger problems are systemic. I was just in Detroit where 9 percent of children suffer lead poisoning (more than in Flint); if this were happening to rich white children on the Upper East Side of Manhattan there would be outraged demands for a national commission and reparations.When opioids were primarily a black problem America’s instinct was harsh prison sentences; now that it is mainly a white problem we’re more compassionate and are improving treatment programs. America’s education system is structured so that white suburban children often get an excellent public education while inner-city black kids disproportionally get a third-rate education.The Supreme Court is now taking up a case called Buck v. Davis involving a murderer named Duane Buck who was sentenced to death after “expert” testimony that he was more likely to commit violent crimes in the future because he was black. What can that be called but racism?

The three who travel in shifts to find new pieces are Paul Johnson top center on a 1989 anodized aluminum chair by Forrest Myers ($15000); Shaun Cooper top left on a decorative brass chair from the 1950's ($3400 for a pair); and Oliver Miller on a 1970's patchwork-metal cube by Paul Evans ($2800). A white stucco-covered garage (bottom right) here dominated by a black leather sofa by Tobia Scarpa for Cassina ($4800) serves as the entrance to the space. "It's not supposed to be intimidating" said Mr. Cooper. "From the outside it looks like a Greek restaurant in the suburbs." The collection with pieces from the 1940's to the present features designers that the team believes will supplant some of the current household names. "Before everyone wanted Eames chairs. Now they want this"said Mr. Johnson indicating a pink velvet chaise by Vladimir Kagan. The chaise notwithstanding most of the furniture has a masculine edge with dark bent woods brass and leather predominating.

9,Premium cigars are not the only ones with rising demand said Mr. Jean whose firm helped take 800-JR Cigar public last June. Sales of mass-market cigars which cost less than $1 each are also growing he said and industry analysts say the same is true for middle-market smokes ($1 to $3).With such strong demand Mr. Jean and many of his peers are convinced that cigar smoking won't just be a fad like Pet Rocks or bell-bottom pants. Also he said there is the fast growth of the prime market for cigar smoking -- men in their 40's and 50's. This age group will increase by 3.7 million people in the next three years alone.Mr. Lurito also points to the past as proof that cigar smoke will not dissipate fast. ''Every time there's been an uptick in cigars over the past 30 to 40 years it's tended to last 7 to 10 years'' he said. ''I've looked at the numbers and they look credible.''Also the recent price declines in cigar stocks may have made them bargains.The four largest companies are trading at 9.5 to 13.8 times their estimated 1998 earnings per share. Yet with demand surging the earnings of all these enterprises are expected to grow at an attractive 25 to 30 percent a year for the next three to five years. These are mouth-watering disparities: A stock is often considered attractive if its price-earnings ratio is moderately less than expected earnings growth.Which cigar stocks look best?For investors interested in the flagship part of the market -- premium smokes -- General Cigar is a logical bet. It gets about 60 percent of its revenues from its Macanudos Partagas and other premium cigars which are presumably less vulnerable to price competition than middle- and mass-market varieties. And its brands are strong: Macanudos for instance is the country's biggest premium seller.The fortunes of Swisher International are more price-sensitive -- only 10 percent of its revenues come from premium cigars -- but the company offers diversity. It sells cigars in all price ranges as well as ''little'' cigars and smokeless tobacco. Combined with strong brand names like King Edward and Optimo its product range can mean a more balanced revenue stream -- a plus in an industry where the future is hazy.Mr. Lurito's fund has been buying more shares of Consolidated Cigar the industry's largest company with $299 million in 1997 sales. Consolidated has a strong presence in the premium market which supplies 45 percent of its revenues and it owns famous brands like Don Diego Dutch Masters and El Producto.

Boris Becker seeded second withdrew from the tournament because of the flu. He will be No. 3 when the next computer ranking of the Association of Tennis Professionals is released. Michael Chang was a 2-6 6-1 6-4 winner over Edberg who is the defending champion and who is ranked No. 1. Omar Camporese beat the third-seeded Courier 7-6 (7-4) 6-3. In the best match of the day Pete Sampras outgunned Goran Ivanisevic 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5) in a battle of booming services. Ivanisevic had 26 aces but none in the deciding tie breaker.

0,Roland Lewis the president and chief executive of the Waterfront Alliance answered City Room readers’ questions this week about land use environmental concerns and preservation of New York and New Jersey’s waterways and harbors. Following is his third and final set of responses. We are no longer accepting questions on this feature.Why is there no official waterfront access for the entire southern coast of the South Bronx? It is the longest stretch of land with no riverfront access. What is M.W.A. doing about it and who else is working on this important issue of equity?— Posted by PabloYou are correct that the southern coast of the Bronx is sorely lacking in waterfront access. A start was made with Barreto Street Park and the Hunts Point Riverside Park but there are literally miles of shorefront that could have access points. In terms of waterfront access the new park at Yankee Stadium also leaves much to be desired. There are great organizations in the Bronx that are working to fix this including Sustainable South Bronx the Point and the Bronx River Alliance. The Waterfront Alliance is working with Borough President Carrion’s office and the New York State Department of State to identify and promote waterfront access points in the South Bronx.I am concerned about the loss of the Todd Shipyard graving dock that was filled for Ikea’s parking lot in Red Hook. Especially when the city just came out with a report saying we need more graving docks in order for our maritime industry to stay competitive. Why do we need ship repair facilities? What’s special about the Erie Basin and Brooklyn waterfront in Red Hook?— Posted by LisaThe loss of the Todd Shipyard to an Ikea parking lot was a tough blow to the maritime industry in New York. In hindsight that decision was particularly disappointing as New York’s Economic Development Corporation’s Maritime Location Study conducted by SUNY Maritime recently concluded that New York City needs eight more ship repair facilities to handle the backlog for this growing industry. Red Hook with its deep water is ideally suited for the maritime industry and across the Erie Basin from Ikea the Erie Basin bargeport hums with activity with tugs and barges coming and going.The Red Hook story is still unfolding. On either side of the Swedish furniture store are now vacant lots one of them was once home to the Revere sugar factory. Will the city follow the prescription in its own report and use this critically needed space for maritime activity or are we sliding down the commercial retail slippery slope with Home Depot Bed Bath and Beyond and their ilk taking up this waterfront space? Ikea itself could help the maritime cause. The store controls two piers that could be used by companies like Hughes Marine to relieve its overcrowded operation in Erie Basin. Also Ikea while it was in development said that it would consider shipping in its goods by barge. What a green and progressive waterfront stroke that would be.And finally the Todd Shipyard is buried but not gone. This valuable piece of maritime infrastructure (worth hundreds of millions of dollars if built today) could someday be excavated and put back to work. The Red Hook story is far from over. Stay tuned and get involved.I understand that boat and ship motors are not very efficient and are not regulated in any degree as cars are. Do you think increased ferries and other commercial motorboats small and large will increase air and noise pollution on the water? Can New York City enforce its own regulations for boat motor emissions?— Posted by StacyGetting people on ferries and goods and recyclables on barges will get cars and trucks off of our roads which would help to clean our air. But if we do not work to clean up the engines that power these vessels we are replacing one problem with another. M.W.A. urges the use of use clean fuels on the water. The City of New York has gotten the ball rolling by mandating the use of lower sulfur diesel fuel on the Staten Island Ferry beginning in 2008. Legislation has also been introduced in the New York City Council that would mandate cleaner fuels for all ferries. Finally bulk purchase of low sulfur diesel or biofuel would help lower the cost for smaller operators.Any idea what’s planned for re-use of the West 135th Street marine transfer station — which is not slated for use under the city’s solid waste management plan? Is there a planning process under way?— Posted by KendallThe use for the West 135th Street Marine Transfer Station is still not determined. WEACT the Harlem based environmental justice organization is working closely with the City and other community leaders is organizing a community-based charrette process that would work to find the best possible reuse for the transfer station.I was wondering what is in store for those rusty ancient piers along the Hudson around 63rd Street (and maybe a brief history of what they originally were used for). I know that Donald Trump apparently ripped one down and it seemed as if he got his hands on half of the others before someone was able to stop him. Are those remaining structures going to be protected or does it seem he will eventually be able to get rid of them to complete his little Battery Park North? At this point they are really natural sculptures and a great reminder that not all of this city’s past can be bought and turned into a suburb. Is there hope?— Posted by ZacI’m with Zac — I also worry about any possible plans for removal of the old piers in river near the West 60s. Please tell me they’re going to stay!— Posted by KatieThose old rusty structures are now commonly known as the “Spaghetti Pier.” Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe and many other appreciators of fine accidental art lobbied to keep them and they have been saved at least for the time being as a science experiment as the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation and the city’s Parks Department are using them to determine the effect of shading on Hudson River fish. I hope the study is very thorough and the Spaghetti Piers stay up for a good long time.I know there was a huge fire in Greenpoint that destroyed most of the neighborhood. But I hope that a commemorative park and small museum is established on the East River’s edge to preserve the Monitor’s special piece of history! The site also as I remember had a wonderful view of the New York City’s wonderful skyline.If my Dad was alive he would have been very sad to see that the World Trade Center towers were destroyed. He had worked on the very precarious top of those buildings installing water lines and air-conditioning equipment. It had been very dangerous work — he was so proud of his effort! We could actually see the towers from the top floor of our Oak Street home. Well at least my family has its unforgettable memories. Let’s hope the Monitor historic site will be restored to the East River water’s edge. I’m sure there are many others who lived in the area that would like to see it preserved too.— Posted by Kathy KiernanThank you for your reminiscence about Greenpoint. The group you should look up and get involved with is the Greenpoint Monitor Museum. The museum does not yet have a home but does not lack for enthusiasts and it would probably welcome a native daughter to lend a hand. When this museum is created it will be a welcome addition to the North Brooklyn waterfront as a well as valuable educational resource about our nation’s history.How will the Governors Island’s waterfront be handled? The simpler least commercial the better.— Posted by dm10003Many people call Governors Island “the Central Park of the Waterfront.” Its future has yet to be decided. Great progress has been made in providing access and fun programming on the island — and most recently in establishing a world-class park. A design team was selected for a 40-acre park on the southern half of the island on the island and design work and some demolition is now under way. The island also contains two historic forts run by the National Park Service. The open question is what will be the programming and use for the dozens of historic buildings on the northern two-thirds of the island. You can keep up to date about news and events on the island by visiting the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation and the Governors Island Alliance. But most of all if you have not made the trip please do. Especially now before the commercial use of the island is settled on — it is a remarkable oasis in the middle of our harbor.My question is: given the recession New York State is facing what impact will the budget cuts both at a city and state level will have on the development and preservation of the waterfront? How can citizens situated at various levels and with a wide range of professional training do pro bono work and assist in the wonderful work already in progress? How can we partner up to make this happen?— Posted by Angelica AquinoWe are entering tough economic times and many of the waterfront efforts will be delayed or possibly even threatened. Your instinct to lend a hand would be welcome by many of the Waterfront Alliance partners. Visit our list of partners at our site and shop around for a waterfront organization that interests you and go volunteer. The economic cycles will come and go but the mission driven work to transform our waterfront by the many alliance partners will persevere and your support will be welcome.Are there plans and a time line to connect the Upper East Side greenway with the Harlem River Esplanade? It is one of the major missing pieces in making the Manhattan Greenway possible. Currently bridge repair has taken acres of waterfront land from 125th Street to 135th Street — a 10-block detour. Then after the Harlem River Esplanade ends at 142nd Street a bicyclist or pedestrian must detour for another 10-13 blocks until the greenway begins again at 156th Street.Unfortunately because of its isolation the Harlem River Esplanade is an area full of gangs drug use and homeless people. By connecting it north and south it will be used and patrolled more and would greatly improve the area.— Posted by Harlem EsplanadeThere are plans but unfortunately they have been put on hold for as long as eight years as the Department of Transportation has taken over this stretch of the waterfront as a staging area for the rebuilding of the Harlem River Drive. One bright spot is the stretch between 139th Street and 142nd Street — where the M.W.A. is in partnership with community partners like as the Harlem River Park Task Force and the city’s Departments of Parks and Recreation — have redesigned the edge of this waterfront. The concrete bulkhead is being replaced with a variegated shoreline that will include a sitting are that could serve as an outdoor classroom tidal pools and a pilot project oyster bed. It will be environmental and accessible. It opens this fall. Check it out.* * *More than the number of questions from so many City Room readers this week the passion and intelligence of your queries and comments impressed me. It is our waterfront. Please be sure politicians government officials and policymakers remember that and keep thinking writing and working to create the world-class waterfront we all deserve.

0,New York State’s Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi apologized this afternoon for making an off-hand comment that Senator Charles E. Schumer “will put a bullet between the President’s eyes if he could get away with it.” He called the comments “incredibly stupid and moronic’’ and insisted that he is “not a person of violence.’’“Nobody feels worse about this than I do’’ Mr. Hevesi a Democrat said during a hastily arranged news conference in midtown Manhattan. “I have made thousands of speeches. And I have never done anything like that.’’Mr. Hevesi made the provocative comments earlier in the day during a commencement ceremony at Queens College where he took a moment to praise Senator Schumer who was also speaking there for the senator’s willingness to challenge the policies of the Republican president.— Raymond Hernandez and Conrad Mulcahy
8,FOR Horacio Gutierrez a concert pianist is not unlike a tightrope walker: Juggling artistic needs with career goals can be a constant balancing act.''You have to be very honest that what you are doing is indeed to enhance your artistic growth and not to fit in with the fads'' said the 38-year-old pianist in an interview the other day. ''You want to do something that you really believe in not just because it's popular or because it's a sure-fire way to get an engagement.''Not that getting engagements has been difficult for him. Since winning the silver medal at the 1970 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow at age 21 Mr. Gutierrez has played and recorded with many of the world's major orchestras. In 1982 he was awarded the $10000 Avery Fisher Prize a noncompetitive honor given to young artists in recognition of their musical achievements.On Sunday at 2 P.M. Mr. Gutierrez will play works by Mendelssohn Schumann Ravel and Liszt in a solo recital at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College one block from the intersection of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues. Tickets are $8 to $17; information: (718) 434-1900. 'Old Friends' and New Challenges

9,Beauty is definitely not in the eye of the beholder and Merce Cunningham's ''Ocean'' a 90-minute dance work bathed in a theatrical blend of light and sound is beautiful by any definition.You don't need to be a Kantian to set up criteria for beauty here. You need only trust your instincts as ''Ocean'' with its elegance (who will call it ugly?) is presented through Sunday by the Lincoln Center Festival '96.Created in Brussels in 1994 then performed abroad and in Berkeley Calif. the piece is now being seen outdoors for the first time. The festival created the perfect setting for a major New York premiere on Tuesday night at Damrosch Park.The performance beginning at 9:30 P.M. to benefit from the darkness was virtually devoid of raindrops. Surrounded by the Metropolitan Opera House the New York State Theater a high-rise and a housing project ''Ocean'' seemed an oasis in an urban grove its small round stage encircled by the audience and technical paraphernalia.
0,California and New York and other big boys can move up their 2008 presidential primaries to influence the nominating contest all they want but tiny New Hampshire still has political muscle to spare.This afternoon Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama fell in line with several rivals for the Democratic nomination and agreed to participate in New Hampshire’s first Democratic presidential debate on June 3 sponsored by WMUR-TV the Union Leader and CNN.The Clinton and Obama campaigns had been ambivalent about participating in the New Hampshire debate: Inundated with dozens of requests for debates around the country the two camps had each preferred to stick to just six debates that are being sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee.Both campaigns indicated today that they still plan to participate in those six D.N.C. debates and are simply adding the New Hampshire forum to the list because well it’s New Hampshire long home to the first-in-the-nation primary that has proved a springboard for candidate after candidate (including Bill “Comeback Kid” Clinton).“The WMUR/Union Leader debate is an important part of the New Hampshire Primary tradition and Senator Clinton is excited to participate” said Clinton spokesperson Mo Elleithee in a statement. “She looks forward to this opportunity to continue her conversation with Granite Staters and demonstrate why she is the candidate most ready to lead and deliver the change we need.“We look forward to participating in the DNC’s schedule of six sanctioned debates that begins in July” Mr. Elleithee added.The Clinton campaign emailed its statement to reporters around 1:30 p.m. and Mr. Obama’s statement went out about 30 minutes later.“We had hoped that the DNC and the debate’s sponsors would agree to make this debate one of the DNC’s six sanctioned debates” said Obama state director Matt Rodriguez. “However Senator Obama believes talking about how we can change our politics with the other candidates in the home of the nation’s first primary is an opportunity too important to miss.”

6,Successful operations with two Convair airlines converted from piston‐powered to turbine‐propelled aircraft have prompted Frontier Airlines to convert its entire fleet of Convair 340 planes.Lewis W. Dymond president of the Denver‐based carrier said that when the final conversion unit was delivered during the second quarter of 1966 he company would have a total of 15 CV580's the new designation of the aircraft.The aircraft will represent an investment of $16 million.The CV580 is powered by two General Motors‐Allison 3750‐horsepower turbine engines. It has a complete interior redesign. At 355 miles an hour the aircraft is 100 miles an hour faster than the pistonpowered 340. The converted plane also has three times the rate of climb and can carry eight more passengers for a total of 52.During June July and August Frontier flew two 580's on its scheduled routes and logged more passenger mileage than all 20 of the line's DC‐3's during the same period. Operating costs during the three months fell substantially below those of the 340's.

1,MADISON Wis. — Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany spent about an hour before Nebraska’s debut game in the Big Ten taking pictures with Cornhusker fans.“Thanks for the invite” repeated fan after fan with their tone implying that they were happy to be out of the Big 12.In an interview outside Camp Randall Stadium Delany seemed to relish the scene he had helped create. An estimated 30000 Nebraska fans poured into Madison for the game and they helped make for a boisterous atmosphere.“It’s more than you could hope for in a way” Delany said. “We couldn’t have predicted the teams would open up undefeated.”Delany said it could take five years to know whether the conference realignment frenzy has calmed in a significant way. He maintained that the Big Ten would not change just to change and lamented how a lot of the changes occurred.“It’s not sometimes the decisions that you make that are so key it’s the decisions that you don’t make” he said. “Most injuries are self-inflicted they’re not necessarily inflicted by others. Unfortunately in my view while there’s always been some change it hasn’t really been evolutionary it’s been a little more revolutionary.”Delany said that he sees leagues trying to force stability through increasing exit fees. “Usually those things happen as a result of comfort not necessarily to ensure comfort and stability” he said.

8,White House aides acknowledged that the most stinging criticism of the commission which was headed by Adm. Robert L.J. Long retired was aimed at the whole idea that the marines' presence in Beirut could by itself shore up the beleaguered pro-Western Government of President Amin Gemayel. The commission urged in fact ''a re-examination of alternative means of achieving U.S. objectives in Lebanon'' including ''a more vigorous and demanding approach to pursuing diplomatic alternatives.''To minimize damage from the commission's criticism Mr. Reagan held a news conference before the report was released and in effect pre-empted the commission's findings with his own assessment of the situation. In addition the White House prevailed on the Pentagon to cancel a briefing on the report to avoid having the military repeat its criticisms.For some time White House aides have acknowledged that military leaders were uncomfortable with Mr. Reagan's widening of the American military role in the Middle East as well as in Central America in the absence of adequate public support. The Long commission concluded that the American military's siding with the Lebanese Army against Druse and Moslem Shiite forces marked a fundamental shift from the marines' original role. They had been sent to Lebanon as an ''evenhanded and neutral'' force in the country's civil conflicts the Long Commission said and once this role was left behind there was a general failure to change the rules of engagement. (Reagan's changing explanations page 4.) Senior Administration officials acknowledge that the marines remain in Lebanon largely because withdrawing them would lead swiftly to withdrawal by French Italian and British forces and that would lead to ''chaos'' as the Lebanese Army fought with its Shiite and Druse foes for the territory left behind.To some at the White House the most compelling reason why Mr. Reagan had to accept responsibility for the deaths of the marines was that he had made the decision to change the nature of their role after sending them in the first place.Among Mr. Reagan's advisers then the main concern about the Long commission was not the casting of blame but whether there would be new impetus for Congress and the public to question the principle of committing American forces to support the Gemayel Government. Some in the Administration agreed that the report would reinforce demands on Capitol Hill that Mr. Reagan do more to force Mr. Gemayel to negotiate to achieve a government of ''national reconciliation.'' Mr. Reagan by rushing to accept blame for the deaths of the marines may have put the issue of culpability behind him even while opening up the debate over his policies.
1,Stanley Fish on education law and society.Citizens United v. Federal Election commission — the recent case in which the Supreme Court invalidated a statute prohibiting corporations and unions from using general treasury funds either to support or defeat a candidate in the 30 days before an election and overruled an earlier decision relied on by the minority — has now been commented on by almost everyone including the president of the United States in his state of the union address.I would like to step back from the debate about whether the decision enhances our First Amendment freedoms or hands the country over to big-money interests and read it instead as the latest installment in an ongoing conflict between two ways of thinking about the First Amendment and its purposes.We can approach the conflict by noting a semantic difference between the majority and concurring opinions on the one hand and the dissenting opinion — a 90-page outpouring of passion and anger by Justice Stevens — on the other. The word most important to Justice Kennedy’s argument (he writes for the majority) is “chill” while the word most important to Stevens’s argument is “corrupt.”Kennedy along with Justices Roberts Alito Thomas and Scalia (the usual suspects) is worried that the restrictions on campaign expenditures imposed by the statute he strikes down will “chill” speech that is prevent some of it from entering the marketplace of ideas that must he believes be open to all voices if the First Amendment’s stricture against the abridging of speech is to be honored. (“[A] statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated.”) Stevens is worried — no he is certain — that the form of speech Kennedy celebrates will corrupt the free flow of information so crucial to the health of a democratic society. “[T]he distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process [has] long been recognized.”When Stevens writes “has long been recognized” he is invoking the force of history and asking us to take note of the reasons why many past court decisions (including one written by then-Chief Justice Rehnquist) have acknowledged the dangers posed by corporations dangers that provoked this declaration by Theodore Roosevelt in 1905: “All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law.”Behind such strong statements is a twin fear: (1) the fear that big money will not only talk (the metaphor that converts campaign expenditures into speech and therefore into a matter that merits First Amendment scrutiny) but will buy votes and influence and (2) the fear that corporations and unions with their huge treasuries will crowd out smaller voices by purchasing all the air time and print space. The majority Stevens admits does “acknowledge the validity of the interest in preventing corruption” but he complains it is not an interest it is interested in for “it effectively discounts the value of that interest to zero.”That’s not quite right. Kennedy and the others in the majority make the proper noises about corruption; they just don’t think that it is likely to occur and they spend much time explaining why corporations are citizens like anyone else (a proposition Stevens ridicules) and why for various economic and public-relation reasons they pose no threat to the integrity of the electoral process.But even if they thought otherwise even if they were persuaded by the dire predictions Stevens and those he cites make they would come down where they do; not because they welcome corruption or have no interest in forestalling it or discount the value of being concerned with it but because they find another interest of more value indeed of surpassing value. That is the value of being faithful to what they take to be the categorical imperative of the First Amendment which with respect to political speech forbids the suppression of voices especially voices “the Government deems to be suspect” (Kennedy); for if this voice now why not other voices later?Even if there were substance to the charge of “undue influence” exercised by those with deep pockets it would still be outweighed says Kennedy citing an earlier case “by the loss for democratic process resulting from the restrictions upon free and full discussion.” The question of where that discussion might take the country is of less interest than the overriding interest in assuring that it is full and free that is open to all and with no exclusions based on a calculation of either the motives or the likely actions of individual or corporate speakers. In this area the majority insists the state cannot act paternally. Voters are adults who must be “free to obtain information from diverse sources”; they are not to be schooled by a government that would protect them from sources it distrusts.Notice how general Kennedy’s rhetoric has become. The specificity of Stevens’s concerns rooted in the historical record and in the psychology and sociology of political actors disappears in the overarching umbrella category of “information.” The syllogism is straightforward. Freedom of information is what the First Amendment protects; corporation and unions are sources of information; therefore their contributions — now imagined as wholly verbal not monetary; the conversion is complete — must be protected come what may.That Kennedy is saying is the Court’s job to allow the process to go forward unimpeded. It is not the Court’s job to fiddle with the process in an effort to make it fairer or more representative a point Chief Justice Roberts makes in his concurring opinion when he cites approvingly the Court’s “repudiation” in Buckley v. Valeo (1976) “of any government interest in ‘equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcomes of elections.’” Equality may be a good thing; it might be nice if no one had a disproportionate share of influence; but it’s not our job to engineer it. Let the market sort it out.The majority’s reasoning reaches back to a famous pronouncement by Oliver Wendell Holmes who acknowledges in Gitlow v. New York (1925) that there are forms of discourse which if permitted to flourish might very well bring disastrous results. Nevertheless he says “If in the long run the beliefs expressed . . . are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way.”Holmes’s fatalism — let everyone speak and if the consequences are bad so be it — stands in contrast to the epistemological optimism of Justice Brandeis who believes that if the marketplace is allowed to be completely open bad speech will be exposed and supplanted by good speech (a reverse Gresham’s law): “The remedy to be supplied is more speech not enforced silence” (Whitney v. California 1927). Both justices reject state manipulation of the speech market  one because he is willing to take what comes — it is Holmes who said that if his fellow countrymen wanted to go to hell in a hand-basket it was his job to help them — the other because he believes that what will come if speech is unfettered will be good.The justices in the Citizens United majority are more in the Brandeis camp. They believe that free trade in ideas with as many trading partners as wish to join in will inevitability produce benign results for a democratic society. And since their confidence in these results is a matter of theoretical faith and not of empirical or historical observation — free speech is for them a religion with long-term rewards awaiting us down the road — they feel no obligation to concern themselves with short-term calculations and predictions.Stevens also values robust intellectual commerce but he believes that allowing corporate voices to have their full and unregulated say “can distort the ‘free trade in ideas’ crucial to candidate elections.” In his view free trade doesn’t take care of itself but must be engineered by the kind of restrictions the majority strikes down. The marketplace of ideas can become congealed and frozen; the free flow can be impeded and when that happens the only way to preserve free speech values is to curtail or restrict some forms of speech just as you might remove noxious weeds so that your garden can begin to grow again. Prohibitions on speech Stevens says can operate “to facilitate First Amendment values” and he openly scorns the majority’s insistence that enlightened self-government “can arise only in the absence of regulation.”The idea that you may have to regulate speech in order to preserve its First Amendment value is called consequentialism. For a consequentialist like Stevens freedom of speech is not a stand-alone value to be cherished for its own sake but a policy that is adhered to because of the benign consequences it is thought to produce consequences that are catalogued in the usual answers to the question what is the First Amendment for?Answers like the First Amendment facilitates the search for truth or the First Amendment is essential to the free flow of ideas in a democratic polity or the First Amendment encourages dissent or the First Amendment provides the materials necessary for informed choice and individual self-realization. If you think of the First Amendment as a mechanism for achieving goals like these you have to contemplate the possibility that some forms of speech will be subversive of those goals because for instance they impede the search for truth or block the free flow of ideas or crowd out dissent. And if such forms of speech appear along with their attendant dangers you will be obligated — not in violation of the First Amendment but in fidelity to it — to move against them as Stevens advises us to do in his opinion.The opposite view of the First Amendment — the view that leads you to be wary of chilling any speech even if it harbors a potential for corruption — is the principled or libertarian or deontological view. Rather than asking what is the First Amendment for and worrying about the negative effects a form of speech may have on the achievement of its goals the principled view asks what does the First Amendment say and answers simply it says no state abridgement of speech. Not no abridgment of speech unless we dislike it or fear it or think of it as having low or no value but no abridgment of speech period especially if the speech in question is implicated in the political process.The cleanest formulation of this position I know is given by the distinguished First Amendment scholar William Van Alstyne: “The First Amendment does not link the protection it provides with any particular objective and may accordingly be deemed to operate without regard to anyone’s view of how well the speech it protects may or may not serve such an objective.”In other words forget about what speech does or does not do in the world; just take care not to restrict it. This makes things relatively easy. All you have to do is determine that it’s speech and then protect it as Kennedy does when he observes that “Section 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is . . . a ban on speech.” That’s it. Nothing more need be said although Kennedy says a lot more largely in order to explain why nothing more need be said and why everything Stevens says — about corruption distortion electoral integrity and undue influence — is beside the doctrinal point.The majority’s purity of principle is somewhat alloyed when it upholds the disclosure requirements of the statute it is considering on the reasoning that the public has a right to be informed about the identity of those who fund a corporation’s ads and videos. “This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions.”Justice Thomas disagrees. The interest “in providing voters with additional relevant information” does not he says outweigh “’the right to anonymous speech.’” The majority’s claim that disclosure requirements do not prevent anyone from speaking is Thomas declares false; those who know that their names will be on a list may refrain from contributing for fear of reprisals and thus be engaged in an act of self-censoring. The effect of disclosure requirements he admonishes is “to curtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.”Only Thomas has the courage of the majority’s declared convictions. Often the most principled of the judges (which doesn’t mean that I always like his principles) he is willing to follow a principle all the way and so he rebukes his colleagues in the majority for preferring the value of more information to the value the First Amendment mandates — absolutely free speech unburdened by any restriction whatsoever including the restriction of having to sign your name. Thomas has caught his fellow conservatives in a consequentialist moment.The consequentialist and principled view of the First Amendment are irreconcilable. Their adherents can only talk past one another and become increasingly angered and frustrated by what they hear from the other side. This ongoing soap opera has been the content of First Amendment jurisprudence ever since it emerged full blown in the second decade of the 20th century. Citizens United is a virtual anthology of the limited repertoire of moves the saga affords. You could build an entire course around it. And that is why even though I agree with much of what Stevens says (I’m a consequentialist myself) and dislike the decision as a citizen as a teacher of First Amendment law I absolutely love it.

9,Dear Diary:A recent trip to Seattle -- where recycling is second nature and environmental transgressions of all sorts weigh heavily on the scales of political incorrectness -- prompted me to return to New York with some new habits. One doesn't have to be a fanatic I reasoned on the flight back to cut down on waste. Shopping bags for example. Why not carry a reusable one and save the 10 or so bags a week that accumulate under my sink?That day I bought a sensible canvas tote and hung it on my apartment door. Of course I forgot to bring it on my first trip to the fruit stand on the corner but determined to change my ways (and spread the example) I piped out virtuously "No bag please!"The woman behind the counter watched with some impatience as I tucked a can and a jar under my right arm balanced two grapefruits between them then pinned the celery and eggplant to my chest with my free hand. Awkward to be sure but I would be less likely to forget the bag in the future.As I made my exit I heard the man who'd been behind me on line as he stepped up to the register: "Double bag please!"This may take a while. -- JOHN BERLIND . . .Dear Diary:As part of my fitness program I have started walking around Washington Square Park three or four times every day. Early on in this routine I made a discovery that stopped me in my tracks: a large plaque on 79 Washington Square East with "Paulette Goddard" emblazoned on it. I knew Miss Goddard had left the bulk of her $20 million estate to New York University but I had not known that a residence hall had been named for the actress who had always been a great favorite of mine.

1,KABUL Afghanistan — Samsor Dawlatzai a part-time laborer settled in after dinner Monday night to watch a television interview with the American peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.The envoy had just mentioned reaching a peace agreement “in principle” with the Taliban when Mr. Dawlatzai’s house collapsed on top of him his family and his guests. A suicide truck bombing nearby left eight people in the house bloodied and battered among them a 1-year-old boy five women and a guest lacerated by flying glass as he prayed.“What peace are you talking about?” Mr. Dawlatzai asked Tuesday referring to Mr. Khalilzad.Mr. Dawlatzai 23 had the misfortune of living near Green Village a fortified compound of foreign nationals that had been rocked by bombings in the past. The latest attack on Monday night destroyed or badly damaged dozens of nearby shops and homes killing up to 30 people and wounding at least 100 security officials said.The police in Kabul said Wednesday that six foreign nationals were killed in Monday’s attack – five Nepalese and one Romanian.
7,Official confirmation of a 24‐hour New Year's Day bombing halt throughout all of Vietnam was expected from the United States command in Saigon. Spokesmen for the command were refusing to confirm the pause during the day apparently following a pattern established when the command announced a 36‐hour Christmas pause after it had passed. The pause was in observance of a New Year's Day cease‐fire proclaimed by both the Communists and the Saigon Government. [Page 1 Column 8.]MONDAY JANUARY 1 1973There were clear signs in Washington that President Nixon's halt in the bombing of North Vietnam above the 20th Parallel had brought him little if any respite from Congressional criticism of his Vietnam policies. House Democrats will caucus tomorrow—the day before Congress is scheduled to convene—and vote on a sense‐of‐the‐party resolution calling for a cut‐off in military spending in Southeast Asia. [1:6–7.]The people of Hanoi were able to get a full night's sleep for the first time since the United States bombing began two weeks ago. Fewer people wore helmets but as many as ever dug air‐raid shelters for the average Vietnamese is not convinced that the bombing is really over. [1:7–8.]Pope Paul VI though ill with influenza made an appearance in an open window of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace and spoke severely about the United States bombing of North Vietnam before giving his customary Sunday blessing He disclosed that in recent “contacts with the interested parties” in the Vietnam war he had appealed for an end to the bombings and new negotiations.

9,Nettie S. Horch an arts patron and co-founder of the Master Institute of United Arts in New York City died at the Humana-Biscayne Hospital in North Miami on Monday. She was 94 years old and lived in Hallandale Fla.She died of bronchitis her daughter Oriole Farb Feshbach said.The Master Institute which began as a music school with a collection of Old Master art works was founded by Mrs. Horch in 1922 with her husband Louis. Its purpose was to help bring people together through the arts.In 1928 the Horches incorporated quarters for the Institute in a 29-story residential skyscraper they built at Riverside Drive and 103d Street. Their aim was to provide an environment of art and culture for apartment dwellers and they developed the concept that income from the apartments would support the art activities of the Institute. The building contained a 300-seat theater a non-profit school of fine arts studio apartments for musicians and dancers and the Riverside Museum a small vanguard institution that became known for showing work that differed from the prevailing currents in the art world. Equality in AcquisitionsMrs. Horch became the director of the museum which not only housed the couple's collection of Tibetan American and American Indian art but mounted many early shows by artists who were later to become well-known like Louise Nevelson. The museumdevoted a number of shows to the work of women and under Mrs. Horch's direction presented in 1939 the first exhibition by the Abstract American Artists whose work ran against the social realist trend of the time. The museum also gave shows to the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. In 1940 it mounted one of the earliest exhibitions of work by Puerto Rican artists.

0,EastThe Dallas Cowboys hope their new head coach Wade Phillips can take them further than Bill Parcells did. Although Parcells never won a playoff game in three seasons with the Cowboys Phillips has never won a playoff game as a head coach — period.Optimists in Dallas say that wide receiver Terrell Owens will be happy and productive while playing for the laid-back Phillips and that quarterback Tony Romo will continue to develop. Skeptics wonder if Romo is the real deal after he followed his sizzling start with a December slump. And does Owens who is credited with ruining the team chemistry in San Francisco and Philadelphia ever stay happy for long?With talented skill position players like Owens Terry Glenn Julius Jones and Jason Witten the Cowboys should give Romo enough help to win consistently. Phillips is an excellent defensive coach so that unit should be fine. The Cowboys should challenge for the division title and at least make the playoffs as a wild card.Having won the division in five of the past six seasons the Philadelphia Eagles look formidable again. Their season largely hinges on the play of quarterback Donovan McNabb who is coming off major knee surgery. With a healthy McNabb the Eagles have a shot to make the Super Bowl.Philadelphia’s offense is balanced and explosive. Brian Westbrook an elusive runner and reliable pass-catching threat is almost as important to the offense as McNabb. The Eagles are developing a solid corps of young wide receivers featuring Reggie Brown Hank Baskett and Jason Avant. Tight end L. J. Smith remains one of McNabb’s favorite targets and the veteran wide receiver Kevin Curtis joined the team as a free agent from St. Louis.The defense is solid and should be bolstered by the addition of linebacker Takeo Spikes acquired in a trade with Buffalo and the return from injury of defensive end Jevon Kearse.The Eagles expect to make the playoffs and they will win the division if the Cowboys do not.Giants Coach Tom Coughlin and quarterback Eli Manning enter the season on the hot seat.The retirement of Tiki Barber leaves a huge void one that the offense will try to fill collectively. Manning still has three reliable veteran pass catchers — wide receivers Plaxico Burress and Amani Toomer and tight end Jeremy Shockey. But all three need to stay healthy for the unit to click. Brandon Jacobs and Reuben Droughns are powerful running backs but they do not possess Barber’s big-play ability.Even before Michael Strahan’s training camp holdout the defense faced serious questions. Mathias Kiwanuka is making the transition to linebacker from the defensive line. Osi Umenyiora is an elite defensive end but the Giants did not force enough turnovers and allowed too many long drives last season. The new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo a former member of the Eagles’ staff will probably use an aggressive approach that features more blitzing.But unless Manning takes a major step forward the Giants will struggle to make the playoffs.With the young Jason Campbell starting at quarterback the Washington Redskins are in transition. Instead of once again signing big-name free agents the Redskins are attempting to improve from within. That will not be easy.Washington has two offensive stars: running back Clinton Portis and wide receiver Santana Moss. But the offensive line is a concern and Campbell’s development will be more difficult if he is under duress. This could be another long season for the Redskins.WestAt least three teams could win the division. The San Francisco 49ers could be this season’s surprise team. They have a developing young quarterback in Alex Smith one of the league’s best running backs in Frank Gore and a young defense that should continue to improve.Signing Nate Clements as a free agent will pay immediate dividends for the 49ers giving them a shutdown cornerback to shadow the league’s best receivers. Brandon Moore is an emerging playmaker at linebacker and he is one reason why San Francisco’s defense is no longer a pushover.Offensively the 49ers have developed chemistry. People wondered after Smith’s rookie season if he was worthy of being the No. 1 pick but his steady sophomore season answered many questions. The only question about Gore is his durability but he is capable of running inside and outside. Vernon Davis is a versatile tight end and the 49ers hope that Darrell Jackson will be as good a receiver for them as he was with Seattle.This is Mike Nolan’s third year as head coach and he has the franchise headed in the right direction. It may be a year too soon for San Francisco to win the division. But if the top players stay healthy the 49ers should reach the playoffs.The Seattle Seahawks have won the division three consecutive times and they still have enough talent to repeat. Running back Shaun Alexander and quarterback Matt Hasselbeck are coming off injury-plagued seasons. When they are healthy the Seahawks are difficult to stop. Seattle will have Deion Branch for a full season and he anchors a formidable receiving corps which includes Bobby Engram and D. J. Hackett. Walter Jones leads an offensive line that provides superb protection.Seattle’s linebacking threesome — Lofa Tatupu Leroy Hill and Julian Peterson — may be the best anywhere. But the secondary could use more speed and the pass rush has lost some of its ferociousness.Coach Mike Holmgren is a strong game planner who has established a consistent winner in Seattle. This team is still a threat to win the division and the conference but if the Seahawks are to reach another Super Bowl they must do it quickly before Alexander gets much older.The St. Louis Rams could win the division or they could finish with a losing record. Steven Jackson has proven that he can be a productive workhorse back. Jackson opens up the passing game for quarterback Marc Bulger and his quality receiving corps of Torry Holt Isaac Bruce and Drew Bennett.Cornerback Tye Hill may be the best player on a suspect defense and defensive end Leonard Little makes opposing quarterbacks nervous. But this defense does not scare opponents. Last season the Rams had a five-game stretch during which they surrendered at least 30 points four times.Last fall many predicted that the Arizona Cardinals would finally enjoy a winning season. It did not happen and it probably will not happen this year. The new coach Ken Whisenhunt brings his creative offensive mind from Pittsburgh and he has talent to work with: superb wide receivers in Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald a proven running back in Edgerrin James and a talented young quarterback in Matt Leinart. But the offensive line must prove that it can protect Leinart. Safety Adrian Wilson is one of the few bright spots on defense.The state of Arizona will play host to the next Super Bowl but do not look for the Cardinals to be playing in it.NorthFive of the past six Super Bowl losers have missed the playoffs the next season but the Chicago Bears are positioned to avoid that trap.The Bears won the National Football Conference title on the strength of defense and special teams. They hope to make a return trip to the Super Bowl with an improved offense.The dangerous kick-return specialist Devin Hester has been converted to a wide receiver and the rookie tight end Greg Olsen was impressive during training camp before injuring his left knee in the final preseason game. Quarterback Rex Grossman can be inconsistent — prone to turnovers one week then hot the next. Cedric Benson takes over as the starting running back replacing Thomas Jones who was traded to the Jets.Chicago’s defense is fast and aggressive led by middle linebacker Brian Urlacher and outside linebacker Lance Briggs. Although he is upset about his contract Briggs will be motivated to have a big season. Defensive tackle Tommie Harris who is returning from a serious hamstring injury will be counted on to help against the run.Coach Lovie Smith is a defensive guru who has the respect of his players and his Bears are the clear favorites in the division.Brett Favre is always the center of attention in Green Bay and he has returned healthy and motivated. Unfortunately for Favre his supporting cast has not been upgraded. Favre wanted the Packers to trade for wide receiver Randy Moss but Moss landed in New England.The defense improved as last season progressed and it will once again be the team’s strength. A. J. Hawk anchors a strong linebacker corps that also features Nick Barnett. Defensive end Aaron Kampman is an excellent pass rusher. The Packers are likely to finish around .500 and fall short of making the playoffs.With inexperience at quarterback the Minnesota Vikings are looking at another rebuilding season. Tarvaris Jackson is being billed as the quarterback of the future but if Jackson struggles the Vikings don’t have strong alternatives.Adrian Peterson who was a force at the University of Oklahoma has all the tools to be a star running back. But because the Vikings lack a veteran quarterback and a big-play wide receiver opposing defenses will be able to focus on stopping the running game which also includes Chester Taylor who rushed for 1216 yards last season.Minnesota has a strong run defense led by tackles Pat Williams and Kevin Williams. But the Vikings will probably miss the defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin who left to become the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.The Detroit Lions’ record the past six seasons is 24-72 and it is a mystery how General Manager Matt Millen has kept his job. The second-year head coach Rod Marinelli has instilled more discipline and accountability.Wide receiver Calvin Johnson Detroit’s first-round pick was widely regarded as the best player in the draft. Johnson and Roy Williams should give the Lions a formidable receiving combo making quarterback Jon Kitna’s job easier. Running back Tatum Bell has looked good during training camp but the offensive line has been a trouble spot in recent years. Kitna was under constant pressure last season throwing 22 interceptions and fumbling 11 times.Linebacker Ernie Sims is a budding star but the defense has plenty of holes. Name a category and the Lions need to improve in it. Even on days when the offense clicks the Lions may not win because their defense will struggle to get off the field. You have probably heard this before: It looks like another long season in Detroit.SouthThe New Orleans Saints are Super Bowl contenders? Believe it. As strange as it sounds for a franchise with such a difficult history the Saints may be the best team in the conference.They have a versatile offense featuring a talented Drew Brees at quarterback a breakaway runner in Reggie Bush a power runner in Deuce McAllister and a reliable receiver in Marques Colston.Bush will probably be more consistent with a season under his belt. His ability to catch passes to line up as a wide receiver and to return punts makes him difficult to defend. Coach Sean Payton plans to give Bush at least 20 touches a game figuring at least one of those will break for a big play. Brees is an accurate passer who quickly recognizes soft spots in the defense. The Saints had the league’s top-ranked offense last season and they should pick up where they left off.Defense will determine if New Orleans reaches its first Super Bowl. The Saints have a solid pass rush but they have not been adept at forcing turnovers or stopping the run. Last season they gave up 35 points against Baltimore 38 against Pittsburgh 31 against Cincinnati 31 points against Carolina and 39 in the conference championship game against the Bears.The Carolina Panthers flopped last season and finished 8-8. This is an aging team with a stagnant roster. Steve Smith is Carolina’s top offensive threat but the Panthers’ reliance on him has taken a toll on his body.A lot of people are feeling the heat particularly Coach John Fox and quarterback Jake Delhomme. The new offensive coordinator Jeff Davidson wants more emphasis on the running game featuring DeShaun Foster DeAngelo Williams and Nick Goings. But the Panthers cannot return to being an elite team unless Delhomme recaptures his form of 2003 when the Panthers were N.F.C. champs. David Carr much-maligned in Houston is now Delhomme’s backup.Julius Peppers is a top pass rusher but the entire defensive line is not what it used to be and the secondary surrendered big plays late last season. Although Fox is regarded as one of the league’s shrewdest coaches he may find himself coaching elsewhere if the Panthers endure another disappointing season.That familiar scowl on Jon Gruden’s face will be seen often unless the Tampa Bay Buccaneers return to playoff form. Gruden is another coach trying to save his job and he is counting on a new quarterback Jeff Garcia to contribute the same magic he had in Philadelphia. Garcia is smart and mobile but he is also 37 and does not have the strongest arm. He will need protection a consistent running game led by Carnell Williams and help from receiver Joey Galloway.On defense Derrick Brooks and Ronde Barber have aged and the younger players have not picked up the slack.Even with Michael Vick the Atlanta Falcons were facing a rebuilding phase. Without Vick their weaknesses become more obvious.The team’s new coach Bobby Petrino has installed the offensive system that he ran successfully at Louisville. But Petrino needs more talent to make it work in Atlanta. Joey Harrington inherits the starting quarterback job.Warrick Dunn is a quality running back but he has logged a lot of miles. Alge Crumpler is a reliable target at tight end.Defensive end John Abraham is an impact player although he is injury prone. DeAngelo Hall is one of the league’s best cornerbacks but there are plenty of areas where the Falcons’ defense can be attacked.
7,At or about 3:30 P.M. on April 14 1977 Eleanor Schrabal was apprehended by a sharp‐eyed Suffolk County policeman at the Hills shopping plaza in Center Moriches. L.I.The charge: Driving a moped.The amazed 46‐year‐old housewife received five summonses two alleging misdemeanors making her one of the more extreme—and probably one of the last—victims of the bizarre dispute surrounding New York State's sixmonth ‐ old revised motorized ‐ bicyle law.Yesterday after six months of confusion over interpretations of the law Justice Robert C. Williams of State Supreme Court gave a long‐slaked green light to unlicensed operation of all mopeds that do not exceed 17 miles an hour.The decision promises to spur locally the fast ‐ spreading national moped craze imported from Europe and to clear the court dockets of cases involving owners like Mrs. Schrabal.
8,Back in 1981 President Reagan's first budget bravely proposed ending the $4 billion in annual farm subsidies that David Stockman the Budget Director reviled as ''organized larceny.'' Five years later those subsidies are up to $30 billion and the Administration is still stumbling from plan to plan in an effort to appease wrathful farmers.The latest initiative timed for the Tuesday elections would pay farmers to idle one-fifth of America's grain land. It might actually save the Treasury some money next year. But it's still a sorry substitute for the free-market design that has been buried by public sympathy for poor farmers and hard-nosed lobbying by the rich ones.The Agriculture Department offers about $2 for every bushel of grain that qualified farmers agree not to plant next spring. That would set back the taxpayers about $2 billion. But in the loony-tunes world of farm subsidies this could prove a bargain. If the grain were planted and grown the Government would be legally obliged to buy and store it at considerably higher cost. Farmers apparently like the new subsidy program too. Cash today for not planting next spring sure beats having to raise crops and risk losing them to weather or insects. And reducing total stocks of grain improves the prospects for future prices.Economists may even rationalize new subsidies for not growing grain that partly offset existing subsidies encouraging production. The result could be output closer to private supply and demand. Lost in the political shuffle though is all pretense of a long-term strategy for returning American agriculture to the free market.

7,JERUSALEM Dec. 1 — In a special six‐hour session the Israeli Cabinet decided today to boycott next month's debate on the Middle East in the United Nations Security Council and approved in principle the establishment of new settlements on the occupied Golan Heights.The unusual Monday Cabinet session was called in response to the Security Council action last night linking the renewal of the United Nations peace‐keeping force on the Golan Heights to a full‐scale debate on the Middle East with Palestinian participation.Israel accepted the sixmonth renewal of the peacekeeping force today but denounced the Council's linking of the extension or the mandate with the Middle East debate terming it a surrender to Syrian pressure.In a long statement issued after the Cabinet meeting the Government contended that the Security Council decision would sabotage peace efforts in the region. It also reaffirmed its determination not to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization in any forum and stated that it would not cooperate in any way with the debate in the Security Council next month.

1,SIOUX CITY Iowa – The more than 100 people who showed up for a town-hall-style event at Morningside College here on Wednesday heard Senator’s Ted Cruz’s thoughts on the battle over a law in Indiana billed as a religious freedom measure.“We’re seeing in the news right now a lot of noise because the state of Indiana bravely stood up and passed a law defending religious liberty” Mr. Cruz said in his opening remarks. “And I say this: I will commend the state of Indiana for doing the right thing.”It seemed Mr. Cruz a Texas Republican had touched a nerve as he was greeted with nods of approval and occasional applause. Indeed western Iowa where Morningside is is one of the most conservative parts of the state home to the evangelical population that has propped up candidates like Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee in the past.Three of the five questions that followed Mr. Cruz’s remarks were on religious liberty and same-sex marriage. Mr. Cruz was direct in his response calling for unwavering defense of religious liberty in the name of the constitution and criticizing those who disagree although not by name.He called out “the Fortune 500” for “running shamelessly to endorse the radical gay-marriage agenda over religious liberty.” And he lamented that “a whole lot of Republican politicians are terrified of this issue.”“I can tell you I’ve had a proven record for over a decade of fighting to defend marriage” he added.Judging by the applause and nodding heads the senator’s message was well received.“I don’t think you can force somebody to participate in something that goes against their religion” said Tyler Brock 41 who asked the first question regarding religious liberty at the event. “For me it is a litmus test because somebody who won’t stand up for the very first thing in our constitution is not going to stand up for a lot of things down the road.”

9,Paul Ramirez Jonas Postmasters Gallery 80 Greene Street near Spring Street SoHo Through March 9This is an intriguing but not completely convincing second show from Paul Ramirez Jonas a promising artist who is deeply intrigued by science and the history of invention.A life-size drawing of the propeller of the S. S. Maine is contrasted with a small model (in a bottle) of the ship whose unexplained sinking accelerated the Spanish-American War -- a discrepancy that pulls the viewer back and forth between feeling gigantic and dwarfed.Also on view are 10 tiny weather vanes cut from tin in 19th-century American motifs. Their forms spin madly either due to large balloons blowing air on them or more mysteriously lights shining on them from just outside the vaccum-sealed glass bottles in which they are sealed.Mr. Ramirez Jonas continues to have a wonderful way with materials scale moving parts and Americana but his kineticism has lost some of its earlier colorfulness and poetry.

1,There’s no other series on television now quite like the TNT cop drama “Southland” for better and for worse. No show advertises its desire to be taken seriously — its bid for instant-classic status — as insistently as this visually austere account of the daily lives of Los Angeles patrol officers and detectives.That intention is telegraphed right away in the sepia-toned opening-credits montage with its images of the Los Angeles River and of Richard Ramirez the Night Stalker. “Southland” wants to be seen alongside Chandler and Ellroy “Chinatown” and “L.A. Confidential” as part of the Southern California-noir pantheon.That didn’t matter to NBC which abruptly canceled the show in October before its second season had even begun. The series drew good reviews but middling-to-poor ratings dropping as low as 4.6 million total viewers during a seven-episode trial run last spring. It had the potential to radiate prestige — to be the type of production that network suits like to be associated with — but it wasn’t drawing viewers in. And NBC had devoted its 10 p.m. time slot the show’s natural home to Jay Leno.Into the breach stepped the cable channel TNT which doesn’t need to attract as many viewers as the broadcast networks do. It reran the seven first-season episodes (the premiere in January drew two million people) and beginning Tuesday will show six new episodes that were completed before NBC pulled the plug. No announcement has been made about the show’s future beyond those six; once again “Southland” finds itself auditioning.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe show has always played a classic double game: it takes the “realistic” nonsensational 9-to-5 approach to police work while bringing in as much action violence and sex around the edges as possible. Episodes begin with chaotic spectacles — the aftermath of a shooting a car rolling and exploding during a high-speed chase — and then become long flashbacks. If you sit through the quotidian detail of the cops’ days you’ll get to see the car blow up again.
9,Judge Souter's personal - not his professional - resume raises troublesome questions. We do not see in his past a body of experience with people other than white middle-class males. He resides in a tiny New Hampshire town (population about 2000) lives in the same small farmhouse in which he was born has never married and apparently has almost no social life. The Senate may well be looking at a nominee whose major experience with blacks comes from watching the ''Cosby Show'' and whose deepest understanding of the concerns of women comes from books and perhaps films.Our society has expended effort to create social institutions in which people of all kinds and both sexes can mingle. We have done this because we have more than an intuitive sense of the value of social integration and the peril of social isolation.Social inclusion can produce a truly intelligent American: one who can relate to our national life in all its facets who knows the wellspring -the aspirations and fears the affections and indifferences - from which particular kinds of thought and behavior flow. Social and geographical seclusion however may very well yield an intellectual who may be smart on technical matters but lacking ''intelligence of the heart'' when it comes to human affairs.From all accounts our society will become even more diverse as we enter the next century. Whites will be outnumbered by blacks Hispanics Asians and other people of color. As our least democratic governmental institution the Supreme Court can least afford to be managed by those from elites who have little feel for their social environment.If the news reports about Judge Souter are correct it is fair to say that no other male nominee to the Supreme Court in recent memory has so distanced himself from minorities women the disabled the downtrodden and the powerless as Judge Souter has.Justice Marshall was as correct in apparently questioning the judge's ability to relate to life as the President was remiss in focusing only on the judge's ability to handle technical legal questions. The Senate Judiciary Committee must now assure the American people that Judge Souter is qualified on both counts.

As the store’s creative director and buyer Sarah is responsible for curating its pioneering mix of fashion art music and gadgetry as well as for brokering the many collaborations that have made the Right Bank address an essential stop on the fashion map.Yesterday was a typical day with many shows and appointments but at the end of the day there was nothing special to remember. Except of course Lapo Elkann receiving guests in his fabulous apartment on Invalides to present his new Italia Independent collection.I’m very excited because today we get the new fluo Sever collection of sunglasses at Colette.Then it was off to make our selection at Comme des Garçons. It’s funny because all the lip motifs remind me of the great girls T-shirt brand from NYC we work with Married to the Mob.I can’t resist giving you a little teaser of the sneaker we’re doing together to be released in April. But seriously it’s amazing how lips are the new skulls: I see it everywhere! Think of the last Benjamin Cho collection with a lipstick print by Dan Colen…I also liked the new “perfecto-duvets” from Ganryu the newest Comme protégé.The finale at Sonia Rykiel was a riot of sequins. It’s so rare to see the models having fun on the catwalk.We also checked out some cool accessories including some cool accessories like these Christmas-ribbon brooches from Tatty Devine disco ball keyrings from Ina Seifart Hollywood Marylin Monroe earrings and necklaces from Atelier 11 and wallets from Paris House.Last night at Fendi I don’t know what was scarier: the huge Bearbrick creature next to the editor Kappauf or the PETA protestors outside.This week-end I have more buying appointments shows and plenty of parties. There is even a Yard Sale at Hotel Amour tomorrow afternoon.if you’re in this neighborhood don’t miss the carrot cake from Rose Bakery (46 rue des Martyrs).On Sunday we’re installing displays for Supreme Terry Richardson and a mysterious green frog window as well as the new Acne gentleman’s jean made in collaboration with Fantastic Man magazine.Thanks a lot to T and The New York Times for this week on The Moment.

0,The entries in the Darwin Birthday Science Song Contest were so good that we named two winners. You can hear them both performed here at the Lab.The winner in the Non-Darwin Division is “I’m a Genius” written in the voice of Albert Einstein who provides a witty and tuneful proof of his intellectual superiority to every other human. It’s by Ray Jessel a veteran of Broadway and cabaret who imagines Einstein surveying his historical rivals:Two cheers for Rembrandt and Immanuel KantBut me I’m a genius!Alexander the GreatNext to me is third rateJust like Paganini is!There’s Igor Stravinsky Nijinsky and Minsky –And Homer of course gets a nod.There’s Newton and NietzscheAnd Pavlov was peachyBut me — I’m a god!Click Below to Listen to “I’m a Genius” performed by Ray Jessel.You can hear Mr. Jessel perform the song by clicking at left and you can see here why he calls himself an Einstein look-alike. You can read the lyrics here.The Darwin Division winner “Mr. Darwin Mr. Wallace Mr. Matthew” tells how a smart — but publicity-naïve — Scottish tree expert failed to get credit for publishing the theory of natural selection more than two decades before Darwin did. It’s by David Haines a British songwriter who directs a choir singing it in the video you can see later in this post.The winners were chosen out of more than 60 entries by Richard Milner the subject of my Findings column and the performer of the one-man show “Charles Darwin: Live and in Concert.” Here’s Mr. Milner’s assessment of the winning song by Mr. Haines along with some very useful history:Evoking a maritime musical flavor of rolling waves Mr. Haines chronicles the voyage of HMS Beagle lovingly ticking off exotic place names that beckoned to young Darwin: Maldives Tasmania St. Helena Galapagos. I was particularly charmed by his clever historically accurate twist. Darwin fans know that a brilliant younger naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was hot on our hero’s heels. Wallace conceived a theory of natural selection independently during a bout of malaria in the jungles of Malaysia spurring Darwin to complete his book in 13 months a task that had eluded him for the previous 20 years. But Haines sings of yet another unfamiliar claimant to the theory—a man named Patrick Matthew (1790-1894) whom virtually no one remembers. A Scottish tree expert Matthew published a summary of natural selection 26 years before Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace’s joint papers of 1858–in a technical book “On Naval Timber and Arboriculture” where it went completely unnoticed. After “On the Origin of Species” (1859) shook the scientific world Matthew protested that he had been first to publish the theory of natural selection. Amused at the man’s presumption Darwin (who had spent decades gathering supporting data) admitted that he would be happy to “freely acknowledge that Mr. Matthew has anticipated [me] by many years.” But he added “no one will feel surprised that neither I nor apparently any other naturalist has heard of Mr. Matthew’s views.” Later Darwin found it delightfully ironic when an even earlier “discoverer” of natural selection came to light. A Scottish-American physician William C. Wells (1757–1817) had set down a similar theory in an equally obscure essay posthumously published in 1818. Upon learning of Wells in 1865 Darwin wrote to a friend “So poor old Patrick Matthew is not the first and he cannot or ought not any longer put on his title-pages `Discoverer of the Principle of Natural Selection.’” David Haines wisely ends with Matthew; an additional verse about Wells would certainly have overloaded and sank his Beagle song. The ever-gracious Alfred Russel Wallace acknowledged by Darwin as his junior partner in the discovery of natural selection opined that the credit should not go to the first person to whom an idea occurs but to the first person “who convinces the world” of its truth. That Wallace said modestly he could never have done.You can watch the video below of “Mr. Darwin” being sung by the North Cambridge Family Opera Festival Chorus. You can read the lyrics here.At YouTube you’ll find a version of “Mr. Darwin” illustrated by an animated movie by Kyle Borlase.You can find out more about the Darwin song and other science-related songs by Mr. Haines at Singtastic.com. Mr. Haines is a composer/writer based in the seaside town of Teignmouth South Devon. For over twenty years he has been working with youth and community music theater groups schools and colleges. He told me:I write science songs the way other people write love songs – driven by passion. I usually know when I’ve written a good one because it makes me cry when I write it – the fact that I’m writing about the robustness of bacteria or the speciation of cichlids in the Great African Lakes makes no difference – I cry at the beauty of the science and at the fact that my song has managed (to my ear) to capture some element of that beauty.The other winner Mr. Jessel was raised in Cardiff Wales and then Toronto has been a longstanding mainstay of Hollywood and New York cabaret. Composer lyricist comedian performer and pianist he was a collaborator on “Baker Street” a Broadway musical about Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Jessel’s songs have been sung by Dean Martin Peggy Lee and Louis Armstrong.His “I’m a Genius” was judged by Mr. Milner to be “fanciful erudite outrageously witty and in my view one of the most hilarious (ranking with Tom Lehrer’s classics “Werner von Braun” and “Lobachevsky”) songs about a scientist ever written.”Congratulations to the winners. Thanks to all the entrants for a superb collection of songs and to Mr. Milner for judging them. (You can watch a great video about Mr. Milner and see his performance of “Darwin’s Nightmare.”)Any comments on the winning songs? Have we unfairly neglected anyone?

9,After the Federal agents finished their intensive search after the Ted Koppel town meeting after the small army of reporters had gone and without a single television camera left to record the event the women here did what they always do when someone is in trouble: they put on a fund-raising supper.It was held tonight at the Lamotte Township Fire Hall as such suppers usually are but this time it was not for anyone they knew. It was for the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing.In the past week similar fund-raisers have undoubtedly been organized in thousands of small towns across America. But Decker a conservative Republican area about 100 miles north of Detroit in Michigan's rural "thumb" region and has one post office one bar and 90 people is not just another sleepy small community anymore. It is the place where James and Terry Nichols who are being held as material witnesses in the Oklahoma City bombing are accused of conspiring to make explosives with Timothy McVeigh the primary suspect in the blast in Oklahoma City.In its own way the fund-raising supper tells more about places like Decker than all the television specials and the camera crews that have flooded the area since Federal agents blocked off the Nichols farm and began searching for explosives. If there were members of paramilitary groups present they didn't call attention to themselves. There were quite a few farmers dressed in work clothes who had driven through high winds and a cold rain.

1,Luke Sharrett for The New York TimesMF Global customers who closed their accounts in the brokerage firm’s final days have been fuming for months about how the firm mailed checks to them instead of promptly transferring the money electronically as usual. Many of those checks arrived after the bankruptcy filing and subsequently bounced.Now customers are taking action trying to show that MF Global delayed the return of their money to cover the firm’s own bills and stay afloat. They are amassing client documents and submitting them to federal investigators in hopes of building a criminal case against MF Global executives.While clients of MF Global say that it was unprecedented for the firm to abandon a longstanding business practice to wire money to customers who were closing accounts the documents are not definite proof of wrongdoing. In recent weeks federal authorities have come to suspect that MF Global’s actions amount to sloppy record-keeping rather than criminal fraud.It is unclear whether investigators are already aware of the checks or if they will find the information useful.But customers who have been waiting months for their money are growing increasingly frustrated. Although the authorities have found that MF Global transferred roughly $1 billion of client funds to banks and other financial firms they cannot easily recoup that money.If prosecutors file criminal charges customers will have a better chance of getting their money back from the banks and other financial firms that currently have the funds. Under the law the trustee working on behalf of customers has more leverage to recover the funds in the event of fraud.“We believe that sufficient evidence exists of intent to commit an actual criminal fraud” according to a memo from the Commodity Customer Coalition which represents farmers grain elevator operators hedge funds and other MF Global clients.The group is collecting documents from a wide array of customers. This week it plans to send documents from one client Steven Kaplan to the Justice Department and to Congressional investigators.On Oct. 27 just days before MF Global filed for bankruptcy Mr. Kaplan 63 sent a fax and letter to the brokerage firm to close his account and have the roughly $26000 in it sent via wire transfer. The next day MF Global mailed a check to Mr. Kaplan a retired accountant who lives in West Palm Beach  Fla. According to the documents he received the check on Nov. 4 four days after the firm had filed for bankruptcy. It bounced.“It’s been like banging your head against the wall and getting nowhere” said Mr. Kaplan who like most other MF Global clients has received only 72 percent of his money. “I thought I was being real smart. I figured ‘Oh good I got out.’ ”The client group in its memo to investigators and prosecutors alludes to a similar pattern with dozens of other MF Global customers. Some clients who terminated their accounts in the days leading up to the bankruptcy received checks instead of wire transfers.The trustee estimated that those who closed their cash accounts before the bankruptcy and received checks are entitled to at least $57 million.In the memo the group argues that the firm was trying to slow the return of money to customers so it could use the funds to meet its own obligations. Some of the checks signed by employees in the firm’s Chicago office were dated Oct. 28. That same day MF Global tapped customer accounts to cover an overdrawn account at JPMorgan Chase  transferring $175 million to the bank.Some of the checks including Mr. Kaplan’s were signed by Edith O’Brien a treasury official in the firm’s Chicago office who has become a central character in the MF Global story.Ms. O’Brien invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when she was called before Congress last week to testify about crucial transfers of customer money during the firm’s last week. She is also seeking immunity from federal prosecution. Ms. O’Brien and other executives at the firm have not been accused of any wrongdoing.Building a criminal case has proved difficult for federal prosecutors. It is unclear whether anyone at MF Global knowingly tapped customer money to cover the overdraft at JPMorgan. MF Global like other firms dealing in futures kept a buffer of its own money in customer accounts to facilitate day-to-day operations and may have dipped into the customer money without knowing it.Even the customer group acknowledged in the memo “No doubt a ‘smoking gun’ of an executive commanding the misuse of customer funds is likely to never be found.”But the group is urging investigators to examine how MF Global accounted for these transfers. MF Global the group said in the memo most likely sent the checks and closed out the accounts in its system which would have reduced the amount of customer funds it was required to keep on hand. But the group said that since the money was sent via check MF Global might have been sitting on the funds and using them to meet other obligations.

Bosco's letter [March 18] has provided an excellent corrective to John Russell's assertion that in ''the last 50 years . . . literature and the arts did not let us down'' [''Tyrants Fall; Art Endures'' Feb. 18] .To those who would refute Mr. Bosco by arguing that those who can paint compose music or write novels should not be expected to have a particular role in politics the answer I believe is that Mr. Bosco's criticism is not leveled against those writers and artists who were apolitical but against those and they are numerous who see themselves as being equipped by their craftsmanship to ''bear witness'' to the moral conflicts of our age ''to tell what no one else can tell'' (to use Mr. Russell's words). And it is in this role by supporting the doctrine of ''moral equivalence'' between East and West rather than supporting the dissidents who led the democratic revolution now sweeping Europe that these artists let us down.LAWRENCE HYMANRidgewood N.J.

8,''Solomon Sheba'' a jazz chamber opera about romance and power was performed Sunday night at Alice Tully Hall by the Harlem Opera Society. Written by Ed Taylor and composed by Sam Rivers in 1973 and directed by Mr. Taylor it used a jazz quartet and a cast of opera and blues-style singers to retell the biblical encounter of Solomon and Makeda the Queen of Sheba.It is a small-scale opera - a series of solos duets and trios with all its dialogue sung. Straightforwardly in the manner of a historical pageant it shows the courts of Solomon and of the virgin queen Makeda who is told of Solomon's wisdom and decides to pay him a visit of state. At Solomon's court the rulers become lovers but then part and return to their royal duties. Supporting characters include two of Solomon's jealous wives two members of Makeda's court and a pair of dancers.Mr. Rivers's music takes four shapes. There are blues and blues-flavored tunes; jazzy ballads; modal incantations and recitatives and at moments of high emotion roiling free jazz. The quartet of Bobby Watson on saxophones and flute Donald Smith on piano Anthony Cox on bass and Eli Fountain on drums handled vamps songs and improvisations with ease and spontaneity.The score makes some motions toward operatic form - returning to the key of A minor whenever Solomon is being kingly for instance - but does not develop themes in any dramatic way; the opera simply proceeds from number to number.

0,The first thing you notice is how happy he is. Walking into a suite that until recently was Dick Cheney’s turf Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is smiling — big time.“All the years you covered me I never quite frankly thought about the vice presidency” Mr. Biden a former Delaware senator said in an interview last week in what was once the secretary of war’s office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. “And when President Obama asked me to join him I wasn’t at all sure whether there was a right place for me” he said adding “But it’s working out.”VideoFor a loquacious 66-year-old whose career has seen family tragedy a health crisis and two failed presidential runs that is a rare understatement. Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina said “It’s an adjustment for Joe — every day is like Christmas.”Mr. Biden will need good humor for his first new job since Richard M. Nixon’s presidency. And now his skills face unexpectedly early tests — in the administration’s effort to prevent its economic stimulus package from becoming a partisan exercise and in trying to salvage Tom Daschle’s nomination for health and human services secretary despite controversy over previously unpaid taxes.The vice president has not surrendered his edgy sometimes impolitic sense of humor. After publicly tweaking Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. during their first days in high office for bungling Mr. Obama’s inaugural oath (the president appeared unamused) Mr. Biden elbowed their predecessors last week by greeting labor union officials with a tart “Welcome back to the White House.”Nor has he shed his propensity to rattle press aides. In the interview his comments on the financial industry bailout and on union-organizing legislation left administration staff members scrambling to make clear that he was not articulating new policy or diverging from Mr. Obama’s position.Yet Mr. Obama chose Mr. Biden not for his verbal facility but for his experience and what David Axelrod the president’s strategist calls “profound common sense.” Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. grew up understanding economic misfortune through the financial setbacks suffered by Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.“He has never forgotten his roots” Mr. Obama said last week in naming the vice president to head a task force on the economic prospects of middle-class families.More relevant this week are the instincts Mr. Biden honed in six terms in the Senate. Two political dramas there are challenging the administration’s script for its first month in office.One concerns the stimulus package which despite the president’s desire for bipartisan backing did not win a single Republican vote in the House. From the telephone to the Senate gym Mr. Biden has been plying former colleagues for Republican support in the Senate with little obvious payoff so far.“This bill is a stinker” Mr. Graham said predicting that significant Republican cooperation would come only with fundamental changes in the package. White House officials show no sign of acceding.The other immediate problem is the nomination of Mr. Daschle the former Senate majority leader who informed Obama officials only after his cabinet nomination that he was liable for $128000 in back taxes. The morning of the interview before the tax controversy flared up publicly Mr. Biden ate breakfast alone with Mr. Daschle. He is working to salvage the nomination which even Daschle allies agree is in doubt.Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut a Democratic colleague for nearly three decades calls these situations precisely where Mr. Biden’s relationships and his feel for “the rhythms of the Senate” can help Mr. Obama assess his options. While Mr. Biden casually sounds out former colleagues Mr. Dodd explained “He can say ‘Off the record — the president’s not going to know your name — what do you think?’ ”Mr. Biden credits his much younger boss with a similarly unceremonious leadership style evoking former President Bill Clinton’s White House but with a greater level of discipline.“There’s never been an elected official I’ve worked with — a president or in my iteration as a senator for 36 years — who is as incisive and disciplined about what he focuses on” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Obama. “He’s clear he’s disciplined there’s a precision in his thinking that has surprised everyone.”“And it goes along with a genuine informality” he continued. “That informality breeds you being prepared to say ‘Well Mr. President I don’t think that works … . As opposed to walking in and saying ‘Sir … .’ ”

8,President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria has taken his boldest move yet to liberalize the country's single-party rule by ousting the most influential hard-liner.The move came a few days before a national referendum Thursday that may usher in some democratic changes in Algeria.The referendum concerns a transfer of some presidential powers to the Prime Minister who will be responsible to the Algerian Parliament. Mr. Benjedid has said that a new legislature would be elected and that candidates would no longer have to belong to the ruling party.Over the weekend the President announced the dismissal of Mohammed Sherif Mussadieh who had been generally viewed as his second-in-command. Mr. Benjedid also undertook fundamental changes in the ruling party's administration which is preparing for a party congress in December and dismissed the army's military security chief Gen. Mejdoub Lakehal Ayat. Further Purge Is Seen

9,There was so much talking between Ray Mercer and Jesse Ferguson in their Feb. 6 bout at Madison Square Garden that George Foreman Larry Merchant and Jim Lampley the HBO announcers began to joke about the jawing.Foreman Merchant and Lampley were commenting on the fight in a warmup that was not for general broadcast. At one point after Mercer had again spoken to Ferguson during a clinch Foreman quipped "I think he just made him an offer to quit."That is apparently what a grand jury believed too. Mercer 32 years old was indicted on a sports bribery charge arrested in Indianapolis on Sunday night and arraigned on the felony charge Tuesday in Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty.District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau contended that Mercer could be heard "repeatedly" on the tapes offering Ferguson a bribe to throw the fight. The district attorney said that Mercer had mentioned $100000. Mercer who lost the 10-round fight had been guaranteed a title shot against Bowe worth at least $1.5 million if he were to defeat Ferguson.
9,Detroit LionsQuarterback Rodney Peete and the Lions resolved their contract differences. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed but the Lions said the contract was dependent upon Peete's passing his physical. A starter since his rookie season in 1989 Peete a sixth-round draft choice from the University of Southern California missed the last half of the 1991 season and the playoffs after tearing his Achilles' tendon. Seattle SeahawksThe Seahawks reeled in the big one coming to terms on a four-year deal with their 300-pound first-round draft choice Ray Roberts an offensive tackle from Virginia. Roberts (No. 10 over all in the 1992 draft) is expected to sign today leaving only one missing rookie wide receiver Michael Bates a sixth-round (No. 151) pick from Arizona. Bates has been excused from camp. He is on the United States Olympic track team as a 200-meter man. Denver BroncosIt's not that quarterback John Elway won't have any friends to throw to but after bidding adios to Ricky Nattiel (traded to Tampa Bay) and Vance Johnson (out for three months with a shoulder tear) the Broncos' Three Amigos are down to one Mark Jackson.The team's receiving corps has been further depleted by off-season back surgery to wide receiver Michael Young who is expected to miss most of training camp and a broken ankle suffered last Saturday by running back Steve Sewell a favorite Elway target on third down.

9,There has been speculation that the Knicks are interested in Wilkins although it would be difficult for New York to sign him. The Knicks are over the salary cap and the largest salary slot they have to offer Wilkins is the $1.25 million slot vacated by Rolando Blackman who will not be re-signed. It will take much more than $1.25 million to sign Wilkins an All-Star forward. But if the Knicks were interested in creating more salary cap room for Wilkins by making a trade Wilkins would be interested in the Knicks."I think adding Dominique to the Knicks would clearly make them the best team in the East" Steve Kauffman Wilkins's agent said yesterday. "I honestly have no idea if New York wants to try and work something out but other people seem to think it's a perfect fit. I expect the phone to be ringing off the hook tomorrow. We'll see who calls."New York selected two talented players in Wednesday night's draft but it remains to be seen how quickly Monty Williams and Charlie Ward will be able to contribute.Outside shooting and quickness were two of New York's biggest needs. Williams can shoot. Ward is quick. Both players will need to improve if they are to play regularly next season. But considering that Williams was selected No. 24 over all and Ward No. 26 the Knicks said they felt fortunate that both players were still available."The talent was pretty evenly matched after the 10 or 12 players but we had Monty Williams rated much higher than No. 24" said Ernie Grunfeld the Knicks' general manager. "He can shoot and we think he's a fine player. And Charlie obviously is a great athlete."

8,The Government took actions today that would mildly stimulate Japan's economy authorizing an income tax cut and adopting budget guidelines for 1988 that depart from the no-growth policies of recent years.The tax reduction worth $8.7 billion a year ran into immediate political trouble because it was coupled with - and largely offset by - a new 20 percent tax on small savings accounts.The Cabinet also approved a budget outline for the 1988 fiscal year which starts April 1. It suggested that overall spending was not likely to change significantly an indication of the willingness of Japan to adhere to its professed commitment to stimulating its economy.In response to the Government's plan opposition parties began a boycott of parliament similar to one earlier this year that ultimately forced the withdrawal of another tax plan - a severe political defeat for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.

8,The way Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sees it the only thing wrong with the little teddy bear holding a minature basketball net and wearing a uniform bearing the blue and gold Los Angeles Laker colors is its name - Kareem Abdul Jabear. The pun according to Abdul-Jabbar who receives no royalites from the enterprise violates his rights to exploit his own name and injures his marketability.Accordingly the Laker star has filed suit in Federal court in Los Angeles against North American Bear Inc. the company that markets the Jabear bear. The Laker center who is seeking unspecified damages as well as an injunction halting sales of the bear is believed to be the first celebrity to object to being the model for one of the company's line of Very Important Bears. Since Barbara L. Isenberg a New York designer started the V.I.B. line it has included such bears as William Shakesbear Zsa Zsa Gabear Douglas Bearbanks Queen Elizabear and Bjorn Bear. Mrs. Isenberg who was also named in the lawsuit could not be reached for comment yesterday.
1,Another day another set of insider trading charges — this time revolving around two buddies accused of illicitly trading in MedImmune.The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Stephen R. Goldfield a former hedge fund manager with illegally making a $14 million profit from trading in MedImmune before its takeover by AstraZenca.Also charged was James W. Self Jr. an executive at an unnamed pharmaceutical company accused of tipping off his friend Mr. Goldfield about MedImmune’s intentions to sell itself. Both men settled the charges.According to the S.E.C.’s complaint Mr. Self learned through his company that MedImmune was looking to sell itself — because his employer was thinking about making a bid. He then tipped Mr. Goldfield a classmate at the the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania about MedImmune’s intentions.Around April 2007 Mr. Self told Mr. Goldfield that the “weather was in the 50s” a coded reference to his employer’s likelihood of making a bid for MedImmune in the $50-a-share range.Mr. Goldfield subsequently bought 17000 call options and 255000 common shares in MedImmune.AstraZeneca ultimately ended up buying MedImmune for $58 a share.In their settlements neither man admitted or denied guilt. Mr. Goldfield agreed to a permanent injunction by the S.E.C. and to pay $600000 of a proposed $16.6 million in disgorged profits and interest. Mr. Self agreed to pay a $50000 fine.Go to S.E.C.
