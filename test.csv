1810,  2008, a, CLIVE Iowa—Mitt Romney has added a new favorite word freighted with meaning in the context of his back and forth with rival Mike Huckabee to his political lexicon today: serious.“We need leaders who will tell us the truth who are serious capable individuals who will deal with the challenges we have” he said at a house party in Ankeny this morning.He offered this at another home in Johnston: “This is a serious election about serious matters.”While speaking before another gathering of supporters and others here Mr. Romney said “It’s a serious and sober time.”Why so serious?Today of course is the morning after the national media spectacle in which Mr. Huckabee held a news conference to release an ad attacking Mr. Romney then announced he was not going to air it but still showed it to the hordes of reporters gathered many of whom laughed in disbelief at what they were seeing.Mr. Romney’s campaign has been trying to use Mr. Huckabee’s affability—he is known as the funniest of the presidential candidates by far—against him portraying him as something of a policy lightweight and sending out critical e-mails on his record entitled “No Laughing Matter.”As has been his pattern since his return to Iowa last week Mr. Romney did not bring up Mr. Huckabee by name during his stump speeches today. But he bore into him again in comments to reporters in Johnston singling out a comment by Mr. Huckabee on Monday to the Quad City Times in which he appeared to take a shot at President Bush while defending himself from an embarrassing moment for him several weeks ago when he did not know about a new National Intelligence Estimate about Iran’s nuclear program.“The whole perception was based on an ambush question on the NIE report” Huckabee said according to the newspaper. “From there it was like ‘Wow.’ That was released at 10 o’clock in the morning. At 5:30 in the afternoon somebody says ‘Have you read the report?’ Maybe I should’ve said ‘Have you read the report?’ President Bush didn’t read it for four years; I don’t know why I should read it in four hours.”Mr. Romney was scathing in his criticism of Mr. Huckabee’s comments saying President Bush should instead be commended for “the great work” he is doing.“I’m not sure whether Governor Huckabee did the attack as a joke but this is not a time to be mocking our president” Mr. Romney said. “And it was I think in bad taste. I think we should come together and recognize the great work our president is doing and not take on our rhetoric or our plays from the Democratic playbook. This is the kind of stuff you expect of the Democrats. But it’s certainly not something you’d expect of a presidential contender on the Republican side.It is a similar line of attack Mr. Romney adopted after Mr. Huckabee published an article in Foreign Affairs last month in which he said the Bush administration was guilty in its foreign policy of an “arrogant bunker mentality.” Mr. Romney apparently counting on the fact that President Bush remains popular among the Republican base came swiftly to the president’s defense and said Mr. Huckabee owed President Bush an apology.Mr. Romney however has been walking a delicate tightrope in defending the president while also centering his closing message in Iowa on bringing change to Washington and at times jabbing the Bush administration for its handling of Iraq and Hurricane Katrina.Separately with the fourth quarter now completed Mr. Romney was pressed for a second day by reporters about how much more of his own money did he pump into his campaign.Mr. Romney who had given more than $17 million through the third quarter confirmed for the first time that he had given additional money to his campaign but claimed to not know exactly how much.“Did I give any more in the fourth quarter as opposed to the third?” he said. “I’m sure I made additional contributions in the fourth quarter but I don’t have any numbers for you.”Afterward Eric Fehrnstron Mr. Romney’s traveling press secretary said Mr. Romney knew “he made a contribution” but did not know how much he had given “exactly.”“All those numbers are being put together” Mr. Fehrnstrom said.
 352,  2017, a, Cultural appropriation is a touchy topic in Canada these days with the recent controversy in Canadian media over whether it is appropriate for nonindigenous writers to take on a native voice for artistic expression. But Marc Miller a member of Canada’s Parliament decided he was on solid ground in giving a speech in Kanyen’kéha the language of the Mohawks in the House of Commons on Thursday.“Language is one of those things that if you apply the appropriation rule would die faster” Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview. He said he was inspired to learn the language because the district he represents in Quebec covers traditional Mohawk land.“I stand here to honor the Mohawk language and I pay my respects to their people” Mr. Miller said in Kanyen’kéha to mark the beginning of Canada’s National Aboriginal History Month. He said in the short speech that he hoped to hear the language more often in Parliament and that more Canadians would “be proud to use it to speak to one another.”

 3817,  1997, a, The House of Representatives today passed a bill that would increase and speed up adoptions of children who have been abused or abandoned by their parents.The measure approved 416 to 5 would make far-reaching changes in child welfare programs and Federal law so states could more easily take youngsters away from parents who had abused them. The changes include new requirements and financial incentives for states.Lawmakers from both parties said state officials had often tried to reunify families at all costs with dire consequences for some children who were beaten or even killed by their biological parents.''The current system sometimes errs in favor of family reunification without regard for the child's safety'' said Representative Barbara B. Kennelly the Connecticut Democrat who is a co-author of the bill.

 5732,  1985, a, The International Trade Commission today granted the Tandon Corporation's request for temporary relief against the Sony Corporation the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Teac Corporation involving the importing of double-sided floppy disk drive products into the United States. Tandon lawyers said that the company expects the commission to order the Japanese companies to post bond for all domestic floppy disk-drive sales while a patent infringement case is pending.Tandon filed the complaint in December. The commission could ultimately exclude Japanese floppy drive products although analysts said that it was unlikely. A final decision in the case is expected by the end of the year. Tandon's patent applies to both 5 1/4-inch drives the most popular in the market and to 3 1/2-inch drives.''This industry is being destroyed so quickly we had to ask for temporary relief'' said Ranjit Sitlani Tandon's vice president for corporate development.

 1420,  2011, a, After a string of smaller deals in the oil patch over the last two years Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is gearing up for a potential blockbuster takeover.The private equity giant is in exclusive talks to buy some or all of the Samson Investment Company a family-owned oil and natural gas exploration company according to a person briefed on the matter.K.K.R. has been studying a possible Samson transaction for some time and has been lining up financing with several banks this person added cautioning that the talks could still fall apart.Should the two sides reach a deal it would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis of September 2008. K.K.R. can already lay claim to one of the priciest private equity deals in the last year having led the purchase of Del Monte Foods for $5.3 billion.Samson currently runs more than 4000 wells and has at least partial ownership of more than 11000 wells across the country according to its Web site.Among its businesses is drilling for oil and natural gas in shale formations an increasingly popular tactic that has driven a wave of takeovers in the energy industry.A deal would bring to a close the Schusterman family’s 40-year control of Samson which has become a respectable oil exploration player that is still based in Tulsa Okla. The company’s current chairwoman and chief executive is Stacy Schusterman daughter of the founder Charles Schusterman.Ms. Schusterman acknowledged the company’s discussions with K.K.R. in an internal memorandum obtained by The Tulsa World:“If a definitive agreement is reached with K.K.R. it will be because they recognize both the value of our assets and our team” Ms. Shusterman said in the statement. “K.K.R. has stated that if we move forward they are committed to building our team at each of our current locations.”A K.K.R. spokeswoman declined to comment.News of K.K.R.’s talks with Samson was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
 2733,  2003, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students consider why photographs in space might not show stars and research the importance of light in this phenomenon. They then research other scientific processes related to light or its absence and create “How It Works” posters about them. Finally students further examine the idea of light pollution and write persuasive paragraphs supporting their views.Author(s):Priscilla Chan The New York Times Learning NetworkBridget Anderson The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Generate reasons for why a photograph taken in space might not show stars.2. Learn the scientific explanation for the missing stars in space photographs by reading and discussing “Seeing Stars.”3. Research other light-dependent or light-independent processes; create and present “How It Works” posters about these processes.4. Further explore the concept of light pollution; share their views in persuasive paragraphs.Resources / Materials:-photograph taken in space in which no stars are visible (optional)-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom blackboard-copies of the article “Seeing Stars” (one per student)-resources about light-dependent and light-independent scientific processes (computers with Internet access library resources encyclopedias science textbooks etc.)-crayons/markers (enough for students to share)-poster board (one piece per small group)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class if available post on the board on a transparency or otherwise make visible to students a photograph taken in space in which no stars are visible. Upon entering class students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “In some photographs taken by astronauts in space stars are not visible. Some people believe that this is proof that these photographs have been faked. However scientists believe there is an explanation for the missing stars. What do you believe and why?” After a few minutes allow students to share their responses. Then discuss the following as a class: Under what conditions are stars visible? Why is it more difficult to see stars in the city than in the countryside? How might this relate to the space photograph situation?2. As a class read and discuss the article “Seeing Stars” focusing on the following questions:a. What explanation is given for why stars are often not seen in photographs taken by astronauts in space or when on airplanes flying at night?b. How might you make stars visible during your next airplane night flight?c. Why were the cameras used by the astronauts in 1969 unlikely to capture any stars?3. Create two columns on the board one titled “Light-Dependent” and the other titled “Light-Independent.” As a class brainstorm in these columns a list of scientific processes that require light and another list of scientific processes that do not require light. Student responses may include but are not limited to photosynthesis vitamin D tanning color vision and solar light (in the light-dependent column) and sonar radar troglobites (cave dwellers) x-rays and night-vision (in the light-independent column).Divide students into small groups of two or three students each and allow each group to choose a light-dependent or light-independent process listed on the board. Using all available resources each group should research their process and create a “How It Works” poster which adheres to the following guidelines (written on the board for easier student access):–Include a picture of the process examined by your group labeled as necessary.–Provide an explanation of why the process is light-dependent or light-independent.–Identify the types of organisms or technologies that utilize the process.–Describe consequences if more or less light is added to the process.Students should complete their posters at home or in a future class. After each group is finished students should present their posters with their classmates and post them in the classroom.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students respond to the following assignment written on the board for them to copy prior to leaving class: “Examine what is meant by the term ‘light pollution.’ Generate a list of benefits and drawbacks to electric lights and interview at least three people about how important they think electric lights are and how important they feel it is to avoid light pollution. Then write a persuasive paragraph summarizing your beliefs about light pollution.”Further Questions for Discussion:–What is a “conspiracy theorist”? Why might such a person want to consider the moon landing a hoax?–What is a star?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses thoughtful participation in class discussions cooperation in small groups accuracy in research about light-dependent and light-independent processes and thoughtful and thorough “how it works” posters on those processes.Vocabulary:faint celestial interior lunar cited conspiracy theorists persists routine wavelengthsExtension Activities:1. Create a “How It Works” poster about the human eye explaining how light and dark are regulated by rods and cones.2. Imagine that you are a third party arbitrator who is trying to resolve a dispute between a power plant that requires 24-hour lighting and a local community that is fighting light pollution. Draw up a proposal for a compromise between the two parties. Consider some of the suggestions provided by a light pollution awareness group (//members.aol.com/ctstarwchr/) and a New Jersey advocacy program (//www.monmouth.com/~ksears/litepol1.htm).3. View a picture taken by the Hubble Space Telescope of the farthest reaches of space (//hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/01/text). Write a letter to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration stating your feelings about such powerful cameras. Do you value the images of other celestial bodies revealed through this amazing photography or do you feel that investing in such powerful photography capabilities is an inefficient use of government funds?4. In the foreseeable future light pollution may make it very difficult to see stars at any time. Create a “star capsule” that compiles images and descriptions of stars that will inform young children in the future about what they are missing.5. Perform a light pollution experiment. Take a night walk to a very illuminated location and count the number of stars you can see and then repeat your count at a very dark location nearby. Create a graph of your data and write a conclusion about to what you think the term “light pollution” refers.6. Explore the “Moon Hoax” controversy by researching different claims made to support or refute the belief that astronauts landed on the moon. Compare the scientific experimentation and explanations offered by Ian Goddard (//iangoddard.net/moon01.htm) with those offered by Kevin Overstreet (//batesmotel.8m.com/). Write a persuasive essay supporting or refuting the hoax theory using scientific explanations in your writing.Interdisciplinary Connections:Mathematics – Analyze a picture of visible light on Earth from space (//earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/Images/land_ocean_ice_lights_2048.jpg). Estimate what percent of the landmasses are most inundated by light pollution. Explain your estimation technique in words. Then place a piece of graph paper over the picture and confirm your estimation using a ratio of the number of boxes where light is visible over the total number of boxes covering the landmasses. Analyze the areas that show the highest concentration of light use. What do these patterns reveal about the world?Global Studies – Locate a city on another landmass that has the opposite light situation as your own city. Write a letter to a young person in that city describing what your city’s sky looks like. Ask him or her to explain what the sky in his or her foreign city looks like.Technology – Create an illustrated timeline that charts the technological advances in cameras. How do digital cameras of today compare with or differ from the self-standing vintage cameras of the late 1800’s?Other Information on the Web:Visit the Science Q&A archive on The Learning Network (//www.nytimes.com/learning/students/scienceqa/index.html) to read past articles from this column categorized into twelve areas of interest.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Science Standard 3- Understands essential ideas about the composition and structure of the universe and the Earth’s place in it.

 3998,  1996, a, This evening Mr. Hinson said "we agree with the thrust of the recommendations."The safety board also said oxidizers the class of chemicals that includes the oxygen generators in the Valujet crash should not be transported in cargo compartments that lack smoke or fire detectors; Mr. Hinson responded that his agency had already begun a review of how oxidizers are shipped. The safety board is an independent agency chartered by Congress to make recommendations to regulatory authorities at all levels of government. The F.A.A. usually but not always follows the recommendations; for example the safety board noted in the letter today that it had previously called for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers for cargo holds but that the aviation agency decided against such precautions.The letter said a Pan Am Boeing 707 cargo plane crashed in November 1973 at Logan International Airport in Boston because of a fire started by materials that were improperly packaged. In addition it cited a DC-10 parked at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago was destroyed by a fire after a technician mishandled an oxygen generator and an an American Airlines DC-9 had a fire in midflight in February 1988 because of unlabeled hazardous materials. That plane landed safely.The letter said that the cause of the Everglades crash was still under investigation but that there might have been as many as 144 oxygen generators on board which "created an extremely dangerous condition." They had been shipped without the protective caps that block them from being set off the board said.The generators had been removed from other Valujet planes by a contractor after their shelf life had expired but they had not been "fired" meaning that the oxygen-producing chemical reaction had not been set off. Such a step would have changed the generators from a hazard capable of starting fires to a chemical compound that can no longer burn or explode. It is mildly hazardous because it includes toxic barium salts but it is enclosed in a stainless-steel canister.Valujet and a contractor that had removed the generators from other Valujet aircraft Sabretech have publicly disagreed over whose fault it was that the generators were not fired.

 966,  2013, a, Eleven partners at the law firm Bingham McCutchen who worked in the firm’s highly regarded securities-enforcement practice resigned on Monday to join Sidley & Austin.Among those departing Bingham are Susan L. Merrill the former head of enforcement at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Neal E. Sullivan the head of the practice group. The group represents Wall Street banks and accounting firms in a variety of government investigations and regulatory matters.Reached late Monday Claire Papanastasiou a spokeswoman for Bingham confirmed the move and said that the firm wished the lawyers well. Carter G. Phillips the co-chairman of Sidley’s executive committee did not immediately return a request for comment.Lateral moves by partners at large corporate law firms have become commonplace but 11 partners leaving a firm en masse especially from such a prominent practice is unusual.The departures are a blow to the Boston-based Bingham a 1000-lawyer firm known for its securities-enforcement work representing financial services firms before a range of government agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Given the ever-changing regulatory landscape in Washington and on Wall Street it is an especially lucrative practice area for law firms.Bingham still has about 20 partners its securities-enforcement practice as well as dozens of others in its securities group. They include Christopher Cox the former S.E.C. chairman who practices corporate law out of the firm’s office in Costa Mesa Calif.The firm made a big splash three years ago when it hired Ms. Merrill the former enforcement chief of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority a private entity that regulates Wall Street. Ms. Merrill who works out of New York was previously a partner for a decade at Davis Polk & Wardwell.“Susan is a recognized leader in the securities field” Jay S. Zimmerman chairman at Bingham said at the time. “Her arrival to Bingham exemplifies our investment and commitment to building the strongest securities team and advising clients in the most complex matters nationally and globally.”Also leaving with Ms. Merrill and Mr. Sullivan is Herbert F. Janick III a former senior member of the enforcement division at the S.E.C. and general counsel of UBS Financial Services.The departures come a few months after another senior partner in Bingham’s securities-enforcement practice Geoffrey F. Aronow left the firm to become general counsel at the S.E.C.Mr. Aronow and Ms. Merrill had recently handled several of the firm’s prominent securities enforcement cases including the representation of Christine Serwinski the former chief financial officer of the North American arm of MF Global the brokerage firm led by Jon Corzine that collapsed in 2011.

 2482,  2005, a, But by making Mr. Humeston's testimony an issue Ms. Sullivan has taken some of the jury's attention off internal Merck e-mail messages and documents that show that company scientists were concerned about Vioxx's heart risks before sales began. And jurors appeared to be paying close attention to Ms. Sullivan's argument that Mr. Humeston's testimony about his Vioxx use was implausible.Mr. Humeston had chronic pain in his left knee because of an injury he suffered in the Vietnam War and he took many different pain medications. In May 2001 almost four months before his heart attack he filled a 30-pill prescription for Vioxx; in July he filled a 20-pill prescription and received 6 sample pills from his doctor's office. Mr. Humeston had his heart attack on Sept. 18 2001 well after he would have run out of Vioxx if he had used his prescriptions as soon as he filled them.In his testimony Mr. Humeston told jurors that he had indeed taken Vioxx in the days leading up to his heart attack. He said he took only two Vioxx doses in May before deciding that the drug did not work and saving the other pills. He then used both the May and July prescriptions after filling the July prescription he said.Ms. Sullivan said she found that explanation implausible. "Why do you get a new prescription of something you know doesn't work for you?" she said to the jury.She also noted that an investigator for the post office had secretly videotaped Mr. Humeston in July 2001 to find out whether his knee injury had disabled him as much as he contended. On Sept. 17 2001 a day before Mr. Humeston's heart attack the inspector told Mr. Humeston's doctor that he believed Mr. Humeston could do additional work at the post office."Mr. Humeston's stress added up to a heart attack" Ms. Sullivan asserted.After a break for lunch Ms. Sullivan closed her argument by discussing several animal and clinical trials of Vioxx which she said proved that Merck had not tried to hide the drug's heart risks. She ended on a more informal note asking the jury not to punish Merck because it works to improve health and cure disease.That drew a rebuke from Judge Higbee who has clashed with Ms. Sullivan throughout the trial. After dismissing the jury Judge Higbee told Ms. Sullivan that her appeal was inappropriate."For some reason" the judge said "you just don't see where the line is."

 3286,  2000, a, ''I don't think it's enjoyable for anybody to sit out a four-hour game and watch both teams club each other to death'' Cook said. ''It's not baseball.''There were still five more runs to be scored but when Ben Petrick flied out and the game finally ended the Mets were left with two victories in three games and hearty batting averages throughout the order.Alfonzo and Zeile both said they were starting to feel better at the plate before coming to Coors; playing in Denver Zeile said accentuates the feeling. Alfonzo had 10 hits in 13 at-bats in the three games and Zeile was 8 for 15.''Everything I hit was going through every hole'' said Alfonzo who had a home run three singles and four runs batted in and improved his batting average 70 points this weekend.Zeile's average also now sits above .300. He has tried to concentrate on hitting the ball up the middle or to the opposite field and he was especially pleased that all three of his hits today went to right. Among those was Zeile's first home run a two-run shot in the fourth off the former Met Brian Bohanon (0-3).''I want to hit the ball where it's pitched'' said Zeile who pulled his three hits on Saturday. ''But for me to have the most success my approach has to be the middle of the field or the right side.''Zeile said playing in Coors Field gives a hitter extra confidence. But the Mets will not benefit from the thin air the wide outfield gaps and the Rockies' flat breaking pitches the rest of this year: this was their only visit to Denver. Valentine is happy about that.

 4073,  1996, a, Just as there is a thread that joins the new school designers in Paris so there has blossomed a common spirit among the younger generation of designers in New York which sets them apart from America's old guard.Even if one did not know Cynthia Rowley Susan Lazar Jill Stuart or Donna Haag one could likely correctly guess their age group: in their 30's. There is a giddy informality in their design that one would not expect to find in the work of say a Bill Blass Donna Karan or Ralph Lauren who have come to stand for sober immortal clothes.For many younger designers now clothes seem alive for the moment vibrating with disposable chic. It is an air that both Ms. Lazar and Ms. Stuart expressed well for spring. Ms. Rowley while inhabiting the same universe was not as successful.Her design locomotive was out of control with no clearly discernible direction evident amid her wide-legged trouser suits long awning-stripe dresses ruffled asymmetrical dresses and coat jackets over slim pants.

 113,  2019, a, CAIRO — At least four protesters were shot dead in Sudan on Thursday according to members of the country’s main protest movement. The killings took place during another round of large-scale demonstrations potentially escalating a tense monthslong standoff between protesters and military leaders.The shootings came just three days after paramilitary forces fired on demonstrators killing five teenagers and an adult.Thousands had taken to the streets in the capital Khartoum and in cities across Sudan on Thursday to demand justice for the killings earlier this week in the south-central city of El-Obeid.“The protests today were a message on El-Obeid — that we are one and that each life matters” said Nadreen Rugheem a physician who protested in Khartoum.

 1881,  2008, a, Usain Bolt of Jamaica set a world record for 100 meters late Saturday running 9.72 and defeating the reigning world champion in the event Tyson Gay of the United States in what was billed as a preview of the Olympic final. About 6500 fans watched the Reebok Grand Prix at Icahn Stadium on Randalls Island. The meet was televised live on ESPN2 and highlights were shown the next afternoon on CBS.A short time earlier and not far away Kimbo Slice defeated James Thompson by technical knockout in mixed martial arts a sport/spectacle that is shall we say not quite on the International Olympic Committee’s radar screen. About 8000 fans watched the bout at the Prudential Center in Newark. The fight card was shown live in prime time by CBS.Two sports heading in different directions at least in the New York area.Icahn was filled to capacity for the Reebok the third of four major American meets in the run-up to the Olympic trials. (A day later 70000 fans in Berlin watched a Golden League track meet.) The stadium is beautiful but its modest size can be seen as emblematic of the decline of track and field as a spectator sport in New York.As recently as a generation ago the city was the world’s hotbed of indoor track. It had been the center of that universe for a century. For a time Madison Square Garden hosted three major meets each season: the Millrose Games the Olympic Invitational (later at the Meadowlands now defunct) and the national championships (later at the Georgia Dome now in Boston). Sellouts were the rule. Today only the Millrose remains and 12000 is considered a banner turnout.Some of today’s bigger meets are held at the armory on 168th Street like Icahn a beautiful facility but one that compared with the Garden is decidedly modest in size. And yet the renovated armory is hardly a new addition to the city’s track landscape. For decades rough-and-tumble all-comers handicap races were held on what was then an unforgiving board track starting early Friday evening and ending sometime around the time the sanitation crews finished their Midtown sweep. Columbia’s Baker Field had a bubble with a steeply banked board track that had once been the Garden’s. All the city’s college teams that didn’t have their own track — well into the 1970s that meant most of them — worked out there cheek by jowl while dodging the occasional errant 35-pound weight that could and did punch a neat hole in the boards. When the world’s best came to town for the big Garden meets they trained there sometimes sharing the track with the collegiate rabble and the flying iron.Track and its fall incarnation cross-country are still extremely popular in the city as participatory sports (visit Van Cortlandt Park any Saturday in October). But puzzlingly as more people have discovered running as a way to stay in shape fewer have taken an interest in track as a spectator sport. Long gone are the days when a Glenn Cunningham was as well known as a Babe Ruth when Jim Ryun was as popular as Johnny Unitas.That’s too bad. Bolt is clearly the caliber of athlete who merits the serious attention of any sports fan. At only 21 and almost 6 feet 5 inches he seems a preternatural talent in one of track’s glamour events. His start is remarkable for a man of his size. His midrace poise belies his relatively meager experience. His finish is devastating. That he also runs the 200 (see video below) and 400 races in which his long stride is an even greater asset makes him the most intriguing all-around sprint talent since Tommie Smith four decades ago. Combine those qualities with what is shaping up to be an epic rivalry with Gay who has won six of their nine head-to-head races in the 100 and 200 and with his countryman Asafa Powell whose record he broke then throw in the fact that this is an Olympic year and there would seem to be reason enough to start following track again at least one 9.72-second slice of it.
 2646,  2004, a, David Zwirner 525 West 19th Street Chelsea Through Oct. 16This almost startlingly beautiful mini-survey of 40 paintings may be your best chance to be won over by On Kawara's austere seemingly relentlessly repetitive notion of art.On Jan. 6 1966 he made a painting whose image was simply the date of its making -- spelled out in meticulous hard-edge sans serif letters on a monochrome ground; he tucked the front page of that day's New York Times into the back of its stretcher. Since then Mr. Kawara has repeated this ritual regularly and with very little variation. His canvases come in five sizes. The fields can be black gray red or blue. The language of the date and the newspaper front page vary according to the country in which he makes the painting.This exhibition clarifies Mr. Kawara's unusual balance between the minimal and the conceptual between matter and mind. His canvases sit on the wall as implacable as Donald Judd boxes; they are specific objects. But they also record equally specific points in time as it unfolds one day after another opening the mind to the unavoidable fact of existence that is not space. ROBERTA SMITH

 1696,  2009, a, Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem became the first affiliate of General Motors to seek Chapter 11 protection as the carmaker prepares for a massive government-sponsored restructuring.The dealership which Reuters noted is owned by G.M. a rarity filed for bankruptcy in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan. While G.M. has not yet filed — it is expected to do so around 8 a.m. — the company described G.M. as a “debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11.” (Read the filing after the jump.)Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem listed more than $1 billion in liabilities. It is seeking to retain a slew of advisers who are also representing G.M. including the law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges and the investment banks Evercore Partners and the Blackstone Group.Its largest creditors were listed as the Wilmington Trust Company representing holders of nearly $22.8 billion of bond debt and affiliates of the United Automobile Workers union representing nearly $20.6 billion in employee obligations.Reuters noted that according to federal bankruptcy rules companies have one of three criteria to fulfill to file a Chapter 11 case in a particular district. G.M. is incorporated in Delaware and its principal place of business is in Michigan. So in order to avail itself of the New York court system it needed an affiliate that had already filed for bankruptcy in that district.Bankruptcy Filing of Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem

 3383,  2000, a, Asked whether he was directing the Florida Legislature's leaders Mr. Bush replied ''We're both being kept abreast of the options and opportunities. I decided that it was best to take our case to the Supreme Court of the United States which will be heard tomorrow. All options are on the table but one of our strategies is to get this election ratified and the sooner the better for the good of the country.''The select committee made up of eight Republicans and six Democrats voted along party lines after two hours of impassioned debate this morning. Each side warned that history would judge the other harshly and each side contended that it was acting in defense of Florida's voters without regard to the presidential ambitions of either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush. Although members strained to maintain a polite tone there was no disguising the partisan fury that has infused both sides.''What the hell is going on?'' Tom Rossin the leading Democrat in the state Senate asked the committee this morning. ''Is this America? Is this democracy? Is this the legacy we want for our children?''Another Democratic senator Betty S. Holzendorf of Jacksonville said she was so disgusted by the whole affair that she planned to skip the special session. ''I'm going on vacation'' she said.For their part Republicans accused Democrats of ignoring their oath of office of shirking their constitutional obligations and of putting Mr. Gore's interests ahead of an entire state. The Democrats they asserted were aiding Mr. Gore in an effort to tie up Florida's election results in court challenges so that he would win by default with a majority of the remaining electoral votes.''Since our motives -- the motives of the majority -- have been presumably exposed by some members of the committee maybe this exposes the alternative motive which is to elect Vice President Gore by our own inaction'' said Senator Daniel Webster a Republican. ''Today is the day to act.''Fully aware of polls showing the political risks of intervening Mr. Webster and other Republican members said they regretted calling for a special session. But they said they had felt compelled to act because of uncertainty which they blamed entirely on recent election rulings by the Florida Supreme Court and on Mr. Gore's decision to contest the results. Those actions they said had placed the outcome of Florida's election in doubt and thus posed a ''significant risk'' that Florida's six million voters would not be represented in the Electoral College.

 2025,  2007, a, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential primary campaign said today that it had raised $26 million during the first quarter more than three times as much as the previous record for this stage of a Democratic primary.The announcement made in a conference call with reporters this afternoon just 14 hours after the end of the first quarter is the latest indication that spending on this year’s presidential race is on track to far surpass any previous election with the leading candidates raising as much as $100 million each before January 1 of the election year.For the first time since the advent of the presidential public campaign financing system after Watergate the top candidates are expected to turn down public money in favor of raising as much as they can from private donors without any limit.The Clinton campaign statement is also the opening of a complicated poker game in which the campaigns will strategize about when and how to disclose details of their fundraising efforts in order to publicize their strengths and downplay their weaknesses. First quarter campaign fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission are not due until April 15 so any information provided before then is voluntary.Some other Democratic primary campaigns said they had brought in much less in contributions. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson raised more than $6 million in the first quarter according to his campaign. Senator Joe Biden of Delaware another Democratic primary candidate said in an interview on Fox News Sunday that he expected to raise about $3 million in the first quarter. Bill Burton a spokesman for Senator Barack Obama Mrs. Clinton’s principal rival said he would not disclose any numbers.In an example of the art of disclosing fundraising figures Senator Clinton’s campaign declined to disclose how much of the $26 million had been raised for the Democratic primary campaign account and how much for ithe general election a detail which could reveal how dependent her campaign is on a relatively small number of big donors.Under campaign finance laws a donor can contribute up to $2300 to a primary campaign and if they chose up to an additional $2300 for the general election. Since campaigns can roll leftover money from their primary campaign account to the general election account campaigns only direct contributions exceeding $2300 into their general election coffers.Thus disclosing how much Mrs. Clinton’s campaign had raised for the general election would indicate how much of her money was raised from donors who contributions had exceeded $2300.Senator John Edwards was expected to release his results early this evening. Mr. Edwards holds the previous record for fundraising in the first quarter of a Democratic primary by a candidate outside the White House having raised $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 before in his previous bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Former Vice President Al Gore raised $9 million in the first quarter of 1999.The disclosures this afternoon illustrated what is likely to be a wide gulf between the top candidates and dark horses in the early fundraising. It remains to be seen how decisive that may be in an election without spending limits in either the primary or general election.Among Republicans a spokesman for Senator John McCain of Arizona said his campaign was not yet willing to disclose its fundraising totals. Spokesmen for former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York had not yet responded to calls by this afternoon.Among the potential dark horse candidates the campaign of Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado has said it raised about $1.3 million.In the logic of campaign publicity campaigns are likely to consider it advantageous to announce numbers at the same time as Senator Clinton if they want their relatively low numbers to be overshadowed in the news coverage. Conversely waiting suggest they may want to attract attention to unexpectedly strong results.

 3249,  2000, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students debate the issues of economic prosperity cultural preservation and environmental preservation in examining the proposed development of land in the Bahamas.Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will1. Identify reasons why an area of land might be desirable to humans; categorize reasons as related to economic prosperity cultural preservation and environmental preservation.2. Examine the debate over the development of Bahamian beaches by reading and discussing “Bahamians Resent the Loss of Beaches to Luxury.”3. Evaluate through research and discussion the issues of the featured article by taking “pro” and “con” approaches in looking at economic prosperity cultural preservation and environmental preservation.4. Analyze through the writing and presenting of proposals the possible compromises between Bahamian development supporters and dissenters.Resources / Materials:-student journals-paper-pens/pencils-classroom blackboard-copies of “Bahamians Resent the Loss of Beaches to Luxury” (one per student)-resource materials on the environment and culture of the Bahamas and on proposed economic development there (computers with Internet access geography textbooks global history textbooks other related classroom resources)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM UP/DO NOW: In their journals students respond to the following question (written on the board prior to class): Many struggles over land have occurred throughout time for different reasons. What are some of the reasons why an area of land might be desirable to human beings? While students are writing create four columns on the board titling them as follows: Economic Prosperity Cultural Preservation Environmental Preservation and Other. Students share their journal responses and categorize them into the columns on the board. Students may supply specific examples for each of their ideas.2. As a class read and discuss “Bahamians Resent the Loss of Beaches to Luxury” focusing on the following questions:a. Why don’t Bahamians have access to the beach?b. Why do developers want to build along the shorelines of the Bahamas?c. Where does the Bahamian government stand on this issue? Where do the people of the Bahamas stand?d. How is the battle between supporters and dissenters of land developments linked to history and to whose history is it linked?e. Why do preservationists and conservationists say this region is a “rare resource of natural beauty and historical richness”?f. What does Laurie Wilkie mean when she calls the Clifton Point region a “veritable Rosetta Stone”?g. Why was Vivian Whylly unsuccessful in filing his claim on the land?h. How could the developers protect the located at Clifton Point?3. Divide students into two main groups half of the class focusing on the “pros” of development in this case and the other group focusing on the “cons” of development. Further divide each group into three smaller groups and assign each subgroup one of the following topics to research with regards to their assigned position: Bahamian economy Bahamian culture Bahamian environment. Using all classroom resources available to them students research their topics and prepare a statement explaining their findings and supporting their positions. The subgroups then share their statements with the class and students should take notes on all presentations.4. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK: Students reflect on the day’s lesson and write out a plan of compromise between the supporters and dissenters of developments in the Bahamas. In a future class students should present and debate their proposals.Further Questions for Discussion:–Is it possible to have art and culture without monetary support?–In what situations do you think environmental preservation can be used or “sacrificed” for economic gain?–What role do the world’s beaches play in the global environment?–What is a gated community? What are the benefits and drawbacks of living in a gated community?–What is a pirate and how has the definition changed over the centuries?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated on written journal entries participation in small group research participation in class discussions and written plans of compromise.Vocabulary:resent reef exclusive access undeveloped marina intersperse amenity contend preservation plantation artifact conservation skeptical iridescent inland wetland archaeologist dwell ilk cove inletExtension Activities:1. Extend the lesson to two days. On the second day review students’ proposals and as a class develop a single plan of compromise that would meet the needs of all sides of the debate.2. Research the steps to declaring a land mass a national park. Under Bahamian law would the region to become Clifton Cay be eligible?3. Identify the various islands that much up the Bahamas. How have developments affected those islands and what effect have they had on the Bahamian economy?4. Investigate the structure of the Bahamian government and research the rise of Prime Minister Ingraham to power.5. Visit an area of your community that still exudes nature. Research the plans for development in that area and compose your own photo essay of the land.6. Research the history of the Lucayan Indians. Who were/are they and what role have they played in the development of Bahamian culture?7. Create a travel guide of New Providence or another Bahamian island. On different pages offer history culture and other important aspects of Bahamian life.8. Research the steps followed when an archaeological find is made at a site to be developed.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History – Examine the parallels between the developing of Clifton Cay and the barrier reefs of the United States. How do American developments affect American economy culture and the environment?Global History – Investigate the creation and use of plantations around the world particularly in the Western hemisphere. Research the term “plantation” including its evolution and current definition and usage.Science – Write a report or create a classroom poster focusing on the impact of developments on the ecosystem including the migration patterns of animals in the Bahamas.-Create a bulletin board collage. Paint a Bahamian reef background. Using the Internet and old magazines clip pictures of Bahamian reef wildlife. Paste pictures onto the bulletin board along with a caption giving the name of the species.Other Information on the Web:The Islands of the Bahamas (//2000.bahamas.com/) is a Bahamas travel guide that allows you to select an island and an activity to see special sites in each location.The Bahamas (//www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/bf.html) from CIA World Factbook offers information on the people geography government economy and much more.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Geography Standard 4- Understands the physical and human characteristics of place.

 1682,  2009, a, He is the first chief executive in decades to lead a major car company into bankruptcy but Robert L. Nardelli hardly considers himself a failure.Instead Mr. Nardelli was holding his head high Thursday for helping keep Chrysler in business — bankruptcy or not The New York Times’s Bill Vlasic reported. “It’s not the fate I would have chosen but it has allowed us to save the company” Mr. Nardelli told The Times in an interview. “I think the cup is half full and not half empty.”His efforts were recognized Thursday by President Obama who singled out Mr. Nardelli in his remarks for his “positive and constructive role” in getting deals with the Italian automaker Fiat the United Automobile Workers and Chrysler’s largest lenders that will be integral to a successful restructuring in bankruptcy court.Once Chrysler emerges from Chapter 11 Mr. Nardelli 60 will leave the company as it transitions to new management selected by a reconstituted board.It was his decision to leave at that point he said. “I got us here” he told The Times. “And I feel good about getting us here.”Still Chrysler’s trip into bankruptcy was hardly the comeback that Mr. Nardelli envisioned when he was hired by Cerberus Capital Management to run the automaker in August 2007.Mr. Nardelli came to Detroit with a reputation as an autocratic executive who had clashed with shareholders and directors at his previous company Home Depot.He methodically tried to change that perception at Chrysler where his long days of work and disciplined approach to business decisions won over many skeptical employees and industry experts.A year ago the privately held Chrysler was flush with cash and leaner than at any time in its history after rounds of job reductions plant closings and production cuts.Mr. Nardelli told The Times that he believed that Chrysler was poised for a renaissance — until the slumping United States economy dragged new-car sales into the ditch.By last fall Chrysler was spending billions of dollars in cash reserves and running dangerously close to insolvency. Only a $4 billion federal loan kept the company from shutting its doors months ago.When he joined his fellow chief executives from General Motors and the Ford Motor Company last November to seek government aid for the industry Mr. Nardelli was set against taking Chrysler into bankruptcy.Even during marathon negotiations in recent days with Chrysler’s unions and banks he held out hope that bankruptcy could be avoided.“I’m disappointed that we couldn’t get all of the lenders to agree” he told The Times. “Filing for Chapter 11 was obviously not my preference.”He says he sees a bright future for Chrysler in its alliance with Fiat which can provide small cars and fuel-efficient engine technology that Chrysler sorely lacks.Once out of bankruptcy Chrysler will have a new board of nine members — the government will select six and Fiat will choose three.That board will select a chief executive for Chrysler. While Mr. Nardelli said he was never told he could not compete for the job he felt it was “the right time to transition” to a new chief executive possibly Fiat’s leader Sergio Marchionne.“I tend to be proactive” Mr. Nardelli told The Times. “I felt let’s get past this issue and get it off the table and behind us.”Thomas LaSorda a vice chairman who was Mr. Nardelli’s immediate predecessor as chief executive will also be leaving Chrysler. Mr. LaSorda 54 said Thursday that he planned to retire but had not set a date. During a conference call with reporters another vice chairman James Press did not make his plans known.In his relatively short time at the top of Chrysler Mr. Nardelli did fulfill much of the agenda laid out for him by Cerberus. He streamlined the company and significantly lowered its costs although tens of thousands of jobs were eliminated in the process.He said he would go back to Cerberus as an adviser and then evaluate other opportunities.Yet wherever he ends up Mr. Nardelli’s business career will be defined in part by Chrysler’s trip into bankruptcy.It has been an emotionally charged experience particularly Thursday morning when he flew back to Detroit from Washington to be at Chrysler headquarters in time to watch Mr. Obama’s speech.“I wanted to be here with our people to provide some confidence and assurances about the future” he told The Times.Go to Article from The New York Times »
 4486,  1993, a, IN the Yankee manager's office someone said "Did you hear the Orioles got Fred McGriff?" Buck Showalter's head spun prompting an apologetic "just kidding." Showalter didn't even smile."McGriff wouldn't make the difference for the Orioles" the Yankee manager was saying now in his serious manner referring to the San Diego Padres' first baseman who led the National League in homers last season. "They'd have to give up David Segui who could be the best first baseman in the league some day. Pitching is what people have to add."Pitching is what the Toronto Blue Jays the eventual World Series champions added late last season in acquiring David Cone from the Mets.Pitching is what the Blue Jays will be searching for soon as will the Yankees the Tigers and the Orioles. The Yankees are whispered to be seeking Tim Belcher of the Cincinnati Reds or Dennis Martinez of the Montreal Expos but they might have to settle for Mark Hutton the Australian right-hander at their Columbus farm team.

 383,  2016, a, They maintain a subscription to the concert series at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion near Houston where their seats are in the sixth row center. Most frequently these days they see Dave Matthews whose own spontaneity renders everyone else loose as well. “He never plays the same show twice” Mr. Barker said.Fans of jazz jam bands and certain dance or electronic music will recognize themselves in this too. Dr. Brown described this to me as “giving yourself over” to the experience. The anything-can-happen vibe will be familiar to people who hunt fish go bird watching play music or paint and also to anyone who has ever shown up in a restaurant and asked the staff to bring out whatever they are most excited about that day.Money eventually does enter the play conversation as it must. But Mr. Boudreaux often uses his play conversations to talk people out of spending. Second homes are a big topic of conversation. He worries about people who pay to keep an inherited second home without stopping to think about whether going there meets their children’s (or their own) definitions of play. Is it voluntary for starters? Do they lose track of time or worry themselves sick over the to-do list?Similarly plenty of people stretch to be the first in their families to buy a lake home or hunting cabin without reckoning with the burdens of maintaining it — or whether their children will be too busy with sports camp or summer jobs to ever go there.Ms. Brown whose family is comfortable financially found herself spending less once she reckoned with Dr. Brown’s definitions of play. Dr. Brown finds himself playing storyteller for his grandchildren as he ages and the tricky double black diamond ski runs in Colorado become more of an effort. (He still enjoys his daily hikes by a river with his dog.)The Barkers actually make money on their concert ticket subscription since they do not go to most shows and resell their excellent seats on the secondary market. That said Don did plow the profits into pricey seats for a coming Adele show as part of a Christmas present for Louise.As for Mr. Boudreaux who said that he found many of the elements of fun in his work too he tries to lead by example. His family of four is in a condo not a grand home on St. Charles Avenue or elsewhere in the finer precincts of New Orleans. But the condo does allow them to have access to a pool which meets the definition of play for him his wife and their older daughter. (Their son is a baby.)
 7419,  1964, a, NORTH WOODMERE L. I. Feb. 29—Mr. and Mrs. Max Gerson have made known the engagement of their daughter Miss Beverly Faye Gerson to Samuel Carl Himelstein. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Himelstein of West Hartford Conn.A wedding in August is planned.Miss Gerson an alumna of Adelphi University is attending the School of Library Science at the Pratt Institute and is with the Brooklyn Public Library.Her fiancé who graduated from Trinity College is a student at the State University Downstate Medical Center.
 2633,  2004, a, Thorncrown is tall and narrow built of glass wood and stone. Mr. Jones used a stabilizing device believed to be new at the time crossed-wood bracing near the ceiling running most of the length of the building. Each brace is two lengths of two-by-four lumber joined by hollow steel joints that produce "a diamond fretwork of light" that creates "the illusion of infinity" Mr. Ivy writes.One of Mr. Jones's most ambitious projects was not completed. Tom Monaghan the founder of Domino's Pizza commissioned a palatial house at Ann Arbor Mich. in 1988. Four years into the project with construction well under way and with $3 million to $4 million already spent by Mr. Jones's estimate Mr. Monaghan suddenly halted the project. He had just read C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" and was stricken by a chapter on greed. He shifted his attention to building a Roman Catholic college in Florida.Mr. Jones designed 135 houses and 15 chapels and churches in 20 states from California to Massachusetts and from Florida to Colorado. Most were in Arkansas. He designed an assortment of other structures including fountains gardens pavilions and commercial buildings. He once designed an auto repair shop but the brothers who owned the business quarreled before it was built.Besides Thorncrown his other well-known sacred structures include the Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel in Bella Vista Ark. and the Marty Leonard Chapel in Fort Worth.Mr. Jones had no interest in skyscrapers but he did drafting work on one the Price Tower in Bartlesville Okla. when he was apprenticed to Wright.Euine Fay Jones was born on Jan. 31 1921 at Pine Bluff Ark. to Euine Fay Jones and Candy Louise Alston Jones. He grew up in El Dorado Ark. where his parents moved to run a restaurant. As a boy he liked to draw and to build treehouses. One burned when a spark from its brick fireplace escaped. He became interested in architecture when he saw a movie short subject in 1938 on Wright's new Johnson's Wax headquarters in Racine Wis.He studied engineering for two and a half years at the University of Arkansas then earned a degree in its new architecture program in 1950. He received a master's degree in 1951 at Rice University in Houston. Two years earlier at an A.I.A. convention in Houston a chance encounter with Wright led to a lasting connection. His first Taliesin Fellowship was in 1953.

 7458,  1964, a, “Negroes have made virtually no progress in the craft unions in Hollywood” Mr. Hill contended. “All that can be said about these unions is that in some instances there have been some token concessions.“Since these are closed unions that have closed‐shop contracts in the industry the attitude of these unions is a clear violation of the National Labor Relations Act.”Mr. Hill declined to say what additional steps would be taken but he has indicated in the past that intervention by the Government might be asked.The craft unions include electricians carpenters propmen and cameramen among others.In many ways these unions are the most powerful labor force here. Some of their leaders have indicated indifference even hostility to the association's campaign.Union officials have pointed out that they have serious problems with unemployment and could not be expected to increase their memberships now. They also have said that new Negro members could not be expected to turn in work performances equal to those of members with more experience and seniority.

 7464,  1964, a, The Illinois outcome although not unexpected was viewed by many political observers as con­solidating Mr. Goldwater's large lead for the Presidential nomi­nation at the convention open­ing July 13 in San Francisco.The Senate Republican leader Everett McKinley Dirksen who is chairman of the delegation announced the results of the poll. He said that he himself had voted for Mr. Goldwater along with the Republican gov­ernorship candidate Charles H. Percy a moderate.He was asked why he had so voted and answered “Why be­cause I wanted to.”Television station WNBQ the Chicago outlet of the National Broadcasting Company report­ed tonight that Senator Dirksen had been asked whether he nominate Senator Gold­water at the convention. The station said Senator Dirksen re­plied that if he were asked to do so he would consider doing it.The candidates met with the Illinois delegates in private.Mr. Goldwater at a wild and shouting news conference his first in a month called the ac­tion “very significant” and said he was “very happy about it.”He declined however to pre­dict that he now had the Re­publican Presidential nom­ination sewed up.“I wouldn't say so definitely” Mr. Goldwater said. “If you wanted to bet me you would need to give some odds.”Flies to MichiganMr. Goldwater later flew to Lansing to appear before the Michigan delegation. This was not a strong area for him. He claims eight delegates; the As­sociated Press delegate poll re­cently gave him only two and Governor Romney has been critical of his conservative views.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Goldwater was met at the airport by about 500 per­sons most of them cheering admirers but there were some hecklers. One carried a sign saying: “You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of Gold­water.”Governor Romney personally seemed as cool as ever toward Mr. Goldwater's candidacy. He said he was “not entirely satis­fied” with Mr. Goldwater's an­swers to questions especially on civil rights collective bargain­ing and foreign policy.Mr. Goldwater said he now believed he had about 690 con­vention votes “or something along in there.” A total of 655 is needed to nominate.But Mr. Goldwater conscious that there could be defections said he would “like a few more as a pad to get me over the hump.”Mr. Goldwater told the news conference that he would de­finitely “uphold” and enforce the civil rights bill if elected President.Reminded that he had said that genuine enforcement would demand the creation of a police state he said he was “afraid” that the nation was “going to have a police state—I don't like that.”But he said anyone serving as President under the bill would have to “accept increases of the police forces on a Federal level.”“I hope to God civil rights doesn't get into the campaign” Mr. Goldwater said when asked if he thought the action of the Iilinois delegation proved that his vote against the civil rights bill would not hurt him in the industrial Northern states.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Dirksen said that Gov­ernor Scranton who addressed the Illinois delegation after Mr. Goldwater had done so had made a “very excellent and pointed talk and made quite an impression.”Goldwater Aide BuoyedRichard Kleindienst co‐direc­tor of field operations for Mr. Goldwater said the poll of the Illinois delegation and the de­cision of the Ohio delegation to back a favorite son “al­most precludes the possibility of success for the stop‐Gold­water movement.”He said that some “break for Scranton in one of those two states is almost a necessity to stop Goldwater” but that this had not happened.The Ohio delegation voted June 22 to cast its 58 votes on the first ballot for Gov. James A. Rhodes as a favorite son.Mr. Goldwater appears to dis­like even when he is winning the extreme bustle of a meet­ing like that of the Illinois del­egation which took place at the O'Hare Inn near the Chi­cago airport.He had to be hustled through masses of his backers chanting “We want Barry” in the hotel and past persistent newsmen. he emerged from meet­ing the delegation photograph­ers shouted for him to make a victory sign.“Don't tell me how to pose”This article can be viewed in its original form.

 1907,  2008, a, Today is the start of World Breastfeeding Week and partly to mark the occasion about 30 women nursing infants rode the A train from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia in Washington Heights to Nostrand Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn. There they exited the subway and joined a rally at Restoration Plaza.But the women were not taking part in the annual subway ride held since 2004 merely to demonstrate their right to breastfeed in public. (Since 1994 it has been legal for women to breastfeed anywhere in public — “irrespective of whether or not the nipple of the mother’s breast is covered during or incidental to the breastfeeding” — under the state’s Civil Rights Law.)The women were advocating for the Breastfeeding Bill of Rights a legislative proposal that has passed the Assembly in Albany but has stalled in the State Senate in part because of concerns raised by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.The law would affirm that pregnant women have the right to information about the “nutritional medical and psychological benefits of breastfeeding”; the right to stay with their babies immediately and continuously after delivery “to facilitate beginning breastfeeding immediately”; the right to refuse bottle feeding for their newborns in hospitals or other health care facilities; the right to be informed about and refuse any drugs that may dry up breast milk; and the right to “refuse any gifts or take-home packets distributed by the maternal health care facility that contain commercial advertising or product samples.” (There has already been a strong push to eliminate baby formula samples from hospital gift bags.)Most of the legislation affirms what is already on the books in state laws or regulations but the bill’s sponsor State Senator Liz Krueger a Manhattan Democrat said the proposal “codifies mothers’ rights to breastfeed into a single concise document and bans commercial interests from influencing new mothers’ choice of breastfeeding.”Ms. Krueger criticized a fellow state senator Kemp Hannon Republican of Long Island saying he “has kept the Breastfeeding Bill of Rights bottled up in committee for too long” and noting that the Assembly has twice passed the bill the last time unanimously.In a phone interview Mr. Hannon said he was not opposed in principle to the legislation but was sensitive to concerns raised by obstetricians and gynecologists about the wording of the proposal. Some of the language concerning access to information he said could be read to mean “interference in the practice of medicine.”Senators Krueger and Hannon both said that the bill’s supporters had tried to address the doctors’ concerns. Ms. Krueger gave him stacks of paper toward the recent end of the legislative session Mr. Hannon said documenting how the bill mostly enshrined provisions already contained in state laws or regulations.“It’s a fine idea but the implementation is something you have to be very cautious about” Mr. Hannon said. “You can’t practice medicine by legislative enactment.”He added that he would be willing to have the Standing Committee on Health which he leads take a look at the bill if the doctors’ concerns are addressed. “The goal is quite laudatory” he said while adding “I think we should leave the practice of medicine to people who are licensed to do that.”Ms. Krueger said the bill represents a consensus among health care providers nutritionists lactation specialists and others involved in the issue including the New York City Breastfeeding Promotion Leadership Committee a working group that includes government agencies nonprofit groups and health care providers.The committee includes groups like the Black Women’s Breastfeeding Alliance the Bronx Breastfeeding Committee and La Leche League International which focus on black and Hispanic women.Traditionally white women and middle-class and affluent women have been far more likely to breastfeed than minority women and women from working-class or poor backgrounds. Many working women find breastfeeding to be too time-consuming or complicated.The dispute appears so far to be one of language and not ideology.The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends breastfeeding an infant through the first year and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports has endorsed breastfeeding because it reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancers adult-onset diabetes and osteoporosis.Studies suggest that more than two-thirds of mothers breastfeed after being discharged from the hospital but the proportion drops dramatically after six months. Hospital-based programs that encourage breastfeeding have been shown to result in women breastfeeding for longer periods.

 958,  2013, a, Ym Yik/European Pressphoto AgencyIs Stephen Schwarzman’s Blackstone Group really bidding for Dell? Or is it part of a bizarre high-stakes charade?That’s the question left lingering in the air in the wake of Dell’s 274-page proxy filing made late last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission about the continuing battle for the company.Mr. Schwarzman’s firm submitted a letter two weeks ago asserting that it planned to pursue a formal bid for Dell worth at least $14.25 a share more than the $13.65 offer that Dell’s board had already agreed to accept from Michael Dell the company’s founder and Silver Lake Partners.To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest given Mr. Dell’s insider status the company’s board was given 45 days to continue to shop the company in hopes of finding a better offer. And indeed the appearance of a conflict of interest for Mr. Dell has become the running narrative. The cover of Barron’s over the weekend featured a cartoon of Mr. Dell running away with a laptop under his arm suggesting he was trying to steal the company with the headline: “Not So Fast Michael.”But over the last 45 days virtually no competing bidders emerged suggesting perhaps that nobody thought Dell was such a steal after all. It wasn’t for lack of trying. Evercore Partners the investment bank was offered an incentive payment of $30 million if it could complete a deal for Dell at a higher price. According to Dell’s proxy Evercore contacted “67 parties including 19 strategic parties 18 financial sponsors and 30 other parties.”Most were not interested. And then Blackstone arrived.What did Mr. Schwarzman see that all of the other prospective bidders must have missed? That remains a mystery.But what Mr. Schwarzman did next thanks to Dell’s disclosure may go a long way toward explaining what’s truly going on: Blackstone told Dell that it would not even consider bidding for the company unless Dell offered to pay the firm’s expenses up to a whopping $25 million.Yes you read that correctly. Blackstone demanded that Dell pay it to go through the motions of bidding.Here it is in the proxy: “The Blackstone consortium informed the special committee that it was not willing to proceed with its evaluation of the transaction contemplated” unless “it received an agreement from the company to reimburse the Blackstone consortium’s out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its evaluation of a possible transaction.”Here’s what’s not in the proxy: Originally Blackstone did not demand to be reimbursed for just out-of-pocket expenses — for consultants travel and the like — but also sought to be able to receive payments for the time of its own executives according to people involved in the process. Just think about it: How much would Mr. Schwarzman bill for his time? $10000 an hour?Ultimately Dell’s special committee agreed to pay Blackstone’s out-of-pocket expenses but not hourly fees or contingency fees for its banking advisers. (By the way the special committee also agreed to pay Silver Lake the same reimbursement to make the process fair.)The fact that Blackstone refused to bid unless its costs were covered by Dell — a highly unusual maneuver — just goes to show you how little confidence it has that it expects to submit a winning bid for Dell.Blackstone also required Dell to indemnify the firm from any lawsuits stemming from its involvement in the auction process according to Dell’s documents.For Dell’s special committee agreeing to these bold demands from Blackstone is probably good business. If the board can keep a second bidder at the table even if the suitor never makes a firm bid Dell’s special committee will have insulated itself from criticism that it did not run a competitive process.The real question is why despite the $25 million reimbursement guarantee Blackstone is risking its reputation to even contemplate a deal for Dell.If Blackstone makes a formal bid — and so far it has not lined up financing — it will most likely be competing against a bid from Mr. Dell. While Blackstone has clearly been invited into the auction process if Mr. Dell quits or is ousted as a result of a winning bid from Blackstone the firm will appear to have made a hostile bid. Private equity firms have spent the last 25 years avoiding anything that could make them perceived as hostile because they typically want management teams to want to do business with them.Last week two Blackstone partners Chinh Chu and David Johnson who recently defected from Dell met with Mr. Dell at his home. Mr. Dell is said to be open to working with Blackstone if they can agree on strategy operations and corporate governance.But by the looks of it Blackstone and Mr. Dell are coming to the table from entirely different angles. Mr. Dell wants to keep the company intact and reinvest in developing the personal computer tablet and emerging-market business. Blackstone’s strategy appears to center on selling Dell’s financing arm — it received some interest from GE Capital — and focusing on its services business.What happens if Mr. Dell comes out with the following statement? “Unfortunately after holding talks with Blackstone in good faith I can’t participate in their transaction because of a disagreement over strategy. Their plan is a short-term and shortsighted effort to break up the company and put in peril Dell’s more than 100000 employees.”All of sudden Blackstone would look like a barbarian at the gate in a big and very public nasty battle. (Some would claim Mr. Dell was being selfish but the damage would be done — to Blackstone.)Alternatively is it really possible Blackstone would try to embrace Mr. Dell and make him the chief executive — which they have said they are open to doing? Blackstone has already been canvassing for other candidates. In fact the firm contacted Mark Hurd of Oracle before ever even discussing the matter with Mr. Dell which of course was a not-so-great way to ingratiate itself with a potential future partner.And then there’s the ownership stakes. Mr. Dell owns about 15 percent of the equity in Dell. It is almost impossible to believe that Blackstone would put in more equity than Mr. Dell already has in the company. That would leave Blackstone as a smaller equity owner than Mr. Dell himself. Would Blackstone really team up with him and let him have control of the company?All of these questions have no good answers. But for $25 million in reimbursed expenses maybe they don’t need them.

 617,  2015, a, PhotoSATURDAY PUZZLE — Rules are made to be broken. If this puzzle by Barry C. Silk had a theme that’s pretty much what it would be.Broadly speaking it’s considered poor form to repeat a word or come close to repeating a word in the construction of a crossword puzzle but in this case it’s a credit to both Mr. Silk and Will Shortz that they throw both GOOGLEPLEX and GOOGOLPLEX into a grid in a devil-may-care way and say “Look! We’re bending the rules and seeing where it takes us.” Both entries are crunchy they are spelled differently they each mean totally different things and personally I think it makes the grid more interesting this way. In other words it’s meant to be a design feature not a flaw. I’m not sure I would want a large dose of this sort of thing in my puzzles but once in a while there is nothing wrong with it. And it certainly makes the solving experience memorable. Six months from now you might not remember a Saturday with all different entries but I am willing to bet that you might say “Hey remember that time Barry Silk said GOOGLEPLEX twice?”What is even more interesting to me is that Mr. Silk was able to fill his grid around this feature fairly well. There is some less-than-desirable stuff like SDS and some of the abbreviations but on balance this worked for me. My gimmes were ORANGEMEN (Syracuse University is my alma mater) ROY ORBISON ANDIE and GOOGLEPLEX which gave me a tremendous toehold in the puzzle especially when you consider that the clues were fairly difficult.And when I say difficult what I really mean is beautifully misdirected. I loved “Acronym associated with retirement?” for REM “Blade handle?” for the otherwise boring entry ATRA “Series of unknown challenges?” for algebra exam and even “Place for a decorative clip” sitting there so quietly waiting for us to try to cram in BROOCH instead of EAR.So when you see what looks like a duplicate entry in your puzzle don’t run for the NEAREST EXIT. Stop and consider whether it’s one of those puzzles that encourages us all to stretch our boundaries and whether you had fun doing it.Let’s check in with Mr. Silk:Constructor’s Notes:GOOGOLPLEX and GOOGLEPLEX were the seeds for this puzzle. My first attempt at pairing these seeds symmetrically in a puzzle used a different grid pattern with the seeds at 1-Across and the last Across. That puzzle’s submission resulted in a rejection from Will Shortz but with feedback saying he liked the the pairing of these seeds. So I decided to try again using a different grid pattern which was subsequently accepted. I constructed this particular puzzle in December 2013 and at that time neither seed had appeared in a New York Times puzzle. This puzzle was accepted in April 2014.In John Hughes’s 1986 movie “Pretty in Pink” Molly Ringwald portrayed the heroine ANDIE but it was Jon Cryer’s performance as the lovelorn Duckie that stood out — particularly in this scene — and made him a star:Your thoughts?

 3927,  1996, a, When the leader of Turkey's surging Islamic party Necmettin Erbakan stepped onto an Ankara street this week after a meeting with business leaders a cheering crowd quickly engulfed him. From windows high above people began waving and chanting his name."What will you do if you are excluded from the new government?" a reporter asked him.Mr. Erbakan paused for a moment to absorb the good will that was washing over him. Then he replied: "We won't do anything. We'll just sit back drink our coffee and enjoy the show."Although he holds strongly Islamic political views Mr. Erbakan is very different from Muslim militants who have emerged in the Middle East and North Africa. He challenges the resolute secularism on which Turkey has been based for more than 70 years but embraces the country's commitment to peaceful politics.Mr. Erbakan's Welfare Party finished first in the parliamentary elections held Dec. 24 taking slightly more than 21 percent of the vote. He would like to join the next coalition government but most established politicians are treating him as a pariah.
 4249,  1995, a, Norris Embry Snyder Fine Art 20 West 57th Street Manhattan Through Dec. 9As an artist Norris Embry was somewhere between an insider and an outsider. Born in Louisville Ky. trained in art school (he studied with Kokoschka no less) he exhibited in galleries and museums in New York until his death in 1980 at 59 so he was not an outsider in that sense. But his works were also an expression of his schizophrenia and his mental illness links him to outsider art.The works are wild raucous paintings and collages made up of newspaper clippings and obscure diaristic writings combined with looming faces random shapes and doodles. Sometimes the works just collapse into headlong chaos. Mostly there was method to Embry's madness. The colors are refulgent purples blues and reds and the images have an almost incantatory quality in their obsessive layered construction. Above all they seem genuine which means they can make you cringe at their anguish at the same time that they win you over through their exuberance and apparent faith in the exorcistic potential of art. Clearly art for Embry was a profound release. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 4485,  1993, a, Less than a year after Oregon voters turned down the strongest measure against gay rights that was ever considered by a state proponents of the measure have come right back with several election victories at the local level.In a two-week election by mail whose ballots were counted Tuesday night all of the four largely rural counties and two small towns that voted on the issue approved by lopsided margins a somewhat toned-down version of last fall's statewide measure which would have deemed homosexuality "abnormal and perverse" and allowed discrimination against homosexuals.The four counties -- Josephine Douglas Linn and Klamath -- and the two towns Junction City and Canby had been chosen by anti-gay forces that undertook petition drives leading to the voting because residents there had strongly backed the state measure. In the six elections combined approximately 90000 people cast votes. The entire state has a population of just under 3 million.The initiatives approved on Tuesday prohibit local governments from doing anything to "promote" homosexuality and bar laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination.

 3515,  1999, a, Cable operators balked at supporting the creation of ESPN in a market that already had Fox Sports West which carried Angels games and Fox Sports West 2 which telecast Mighty Ducks games. Once the ESPN West plan died Fox extended the Angels and Mighty Ducks' deals for an additional 10 years each.''Without ESPN West owning the teams just isn't worth it for Disney'' said John Moag managing director of the sports industry group at Legg Mason an investment bank based in Baltimore.It is possible that if Disney had successfully started ESPN West -- and figured it had reached its goal to improve the business climate for Disneyland in Anaheim by owning the Angels and the Mighty Ducks -- it might have sold the teams but kept their television rights.The allure of combining its teams with a cable television property was tantalizing to Disney allowing it to reap revenue from gate receipts advertising and cable fees. In New York Cablevision does it by owning the Knicks and Rangers and the MSG Network which carries their games locally.The Fox Sports Group owns the Dodgers and shows their games on its Fox Sports West channel.Beyond the failure to start ESPN West Disney is looking to boost its stock price and earnings by selling non-core businesses to focus on theme parks film and television production videos and retailing. Last month it agreed to sell Fairchild Publications for $650 million.The company is doing well with its ownership of ESPN but is working to improve lackluster results at the third-place ABC network.The teams might not have become expendable had they been profitable league champions or had Disney's stock continued to soar as it had when the Eisner-led company never seemed to make a misstep.

 6234,  1973, a, WASHINGTON Feb. 1 —North Vietnam turned over to the United States in Paris today the names of nine American prisoners — seven servicemen and two civilians—held by Communist forces in Laos. The list also included the name of a Canadian civilian.American officials were privately disappointed by the list since they had hoped that it would contain a substantial number of the 311 servicemen whom the Defense Department had reported missing and the 6 men carried as prisoners in Laos. Officials emphasized that the United States would be seeking clarification on the status of men believed captured or missing.The provision of the prisoner list for Laos removed one procedural hitch that had developed in the prisoner‐exchange program under the Vietnam cease‐fire agreement that was signed Saturday and it presumably cleared the way for release of the prisoners probably starting next week.When the Communist side supplied information Saturday on prisoners it held the lists—to the surprise of American ofoped in the prisoner‐exchange program under the Vietnam cease‐fire agreement that was signed Saturday and it presumably cleared the way for release of the prisoners probably starting next week.

Mr. Bush he said had strengthened Al Qaeda with a war in Iraq that was a "diversion" in the broader war on terrorism.With that exchange the two men crystallized an argument that has bubbled along for months now an argument over whether toppling Saddam Hussein was the right course or the wrong one for a nation suddenly confronted with a set of threats that were never aired during the last presidential campaign. It captured in a moment of head-to-head clarity rarely seen in this campaign so far the starkly different ways the Vietnam veteran and the sitting commander in chief view the question of when diplomacy has been exhausted and how to focus the resources of a superpower that for all its strength cannot deploy its armies on every potential battlefield.On everything from the question of whether the coalition that Mr. Bush put together to attack Iraq was truly a global alliance for a global war on terrorism or a Potemkin coalition of convenience to whether Mr. Bush deserved credit for breaking up the world's most dangerous network of nuclear salesmen or has left bomb material lying around for terrorists to seize the two men chose their facts to bolster their arguments for taking very different roads. Along the way each rewrote recent history a bit.
 47,  2019, a, We arrived at the border at Calexico Calif. on Dec. 31. Despite appealing for help I was turned away by the Border Patrol agents. Desperate to reunite our family I found us a way across in the early morning hours of Jan. 1.We were caught by agents after we crossed and taken to one of the detention centers known as “hieleras” or iceboxes because they are kept so cold. There I learned that Kevin was taken to the same detention center with Grethshell and she had been separated from her father . Two fellow migrant women told me that five agents held him down while they ripped her from his arms. Other migrant women were asked to watch her.When I and my two other children were released on Jan. 2 my uncle confirmed what the women had told me. Kevin was charged with a felony for returning to the United States after having been deported. He was taken to jail while our daughter was sent to a shelter for migrant children in San Antonio.The family separation was not reported to the court on his charging documents. The charges against him were dropped but Immigration and Customs Enforcement is still using those initial charges as an excuse to keep him detained indefinitely while he fights for asylum.I was told I would be reunited with my daughter in a week but first I needed to fill out paperwork. Then I was told to provide a credit card with up to a $4000 credit line for her flight an impossibility for me. Officials refused to say who was looking after her. Finally I got fed up and went to the press. Grethshell was finally put on a plane and brought to me after I threatened to go to the address I had for the shelter manager and get her myself.When a social worker put my daughter in my arms on Jan. 30 she was inconsolable. My whole body shook as I held her and tried to soothe her telling her that everything would be O.K. She was so sick I had to take her to the doctor the next day. For three weeks she resisted me fearful when I tried to hold her. She still cries out for her father at night.I know I am not alone. There are around 311000 immigrants who have requested asylum after escaping violence in their home countries like us. Our future is uncertain. My children and I were just evicted from the home we shared with six other people. I’m trying to survive as a single mother of three. I don’t know if we’ll be granted asylum or sent back to our deaths at the hands of the gangs.
 301,  2017, a, 1. Reaction to President Trump’s address tended to focus on its sober style. His seriousness of purpose and calls for unity reassured — and surprised — many listeners.“I think it sounded great like a utopia” one voter said adding “I don’t think it’s that simple.”Indeed Mr. Trump who met with congressional Republican leaders on Wednesday faces not only a committed Democratic opposition but a divided Republican Party.

 2110,  2007, a, Alan Weisman’s book “The World Without Us” is a 324-page thought experiment: What would happen to the Earth if humans ceased to exist? The work published in June is not a science-fiction novel but rather a thoroughly researched scientifically grounded account of how the environment — natural and built — would change if people were no longer around.One chapter in the book “The City Without Us” is particularly relevant — if depressing — for New Yorkers. It portrays a city robbed of its eight million people submerged by water from below then ravaged by devastating fires and finally overgrown with vegetation. The Web site for the book has a fascinating slide show depicting New York City’s fate from two days to 15000 years after the disappearance of humans.In a phone interview with Mr. Weisman a journalist who has written extensively about science he told us why he chose Manhattan as his case study of a city without humans:Manhattan Island kind of epitomizes urbanity. The thought of all this concrete and steel reverting to forest is unthinkable and yet it turns out there was a forest there before. My question when I went to New York – and it’s a question I posed to civil engineers architects climatologists botanists and biologists — was: Could the city ever revert to a forest again? And the unanimous conclusion was: Absolutely. Not only would it but it will.The book’s chapter on New York begins with Eric W. Sanderson a landscape ecologist who directs the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Mannahatta Project an attempt to recreate through computer simulations what Manhattan Island looked like when Henry Hudson first saw it in 1609. (Bottom line the island was much more watery then.)What follows in the chapter is an explanation of how that landscape fairly untouched until the arrival of Europeans would quickly reestablish itself if humans were gone. For starters subway tunnels — which are kept dry because of a system of pumps that remove 13 million gallons of water each day — would flood. (This already happens when heavy rains drench the city as occurred on Aug. 8.) Without the pumps water would fill the subway system in a couple of days; clogged sewers would overflow flooding the street surface. “Within 20 years the water-soaked steel columns that support the street above the East Side’s 4 5 and 6 trains corrode and buckle” Mr. Weisman writes. “As Lexington Avenue caves in it becomes a river.”Even now the freeze-thaw cycle creates cracks in the city sidewalk that weeds quickly fill. Without maintenance workers to pull up those weeks the roots of the powerful and hardy ailanthus tree would heave up sidewalks and wreak havoc on sewers.“Starting with the mulch collecting in gutters a layer of soil will start forming atop New York’s sterile hard shell and seedlings will sprout” Mr. Weisman writes.Skeptical? Look no farther than the High Line the abandoned segment of elevated railroad track in Manhattan. Trains stopped running there in 1980 and ailanthus trees quickly emerged — joined by onion grass lamb’s ear goldenrod crocuses irises evening primrose asters and Queen Anne’s lace. This “untended flowering green ribbon” Mr. Weisman notes is now scheduled to become a park.Without heating and air-conditioning Manhattan’s skyscrapers would expand and contract with the cold and hot weather. Joints between walls and roof lines would separate rain would enter bots would rust facades would pop off and insulation would be exposed. Dry lightning would ignite dead branches and leaves. Gas lines would catch fire.Within 200 years of humans’ disappearance Mr. Weisman writes “colonizing trees will have substantially replaced pioneer weeds.”Buildings would collapse their crushed concrete raising the pH levels of the soil beneath good news for trees that need less acidic environments. With stronger and more frequent hurricanes buffering the Atlantic coast unsteady structures would be toppled by the wind. Without constant painting and maintenance bridges would corrode and buckle.“Gradually the asphalt jungle will give way to a real one” Mr. Weisman writes.(Curious detail: Contrary to the conventional wisdom he writes without our heated buildings and garbage the cockroaches and rats would quickly freeze and starve to death.)Some of the most intriguing observations in the chapter concern the durability and permanence of modern glass and steel buildings. Such buildings would not survive long without constant human maintenance according to Mr. Weisman. In contrast older stone buildings like Grand Central Terminal and St. Paul’s Chapel (“built in 1766 from Manhattan’s own hard schist”) would be among New York’s most enduring monuments. So would bank vaults which are built for strength.Mr. Weisman said he did not expect when he set out on his research to discover that the soaring edifices of Manhattan are in fact quite fragile. “It was a surprise to me when I started talking to people to find out that cities can and will collapse particularly cities that are not made out of big immense chunks of stone” he said in the interview. “Our construction just isn’t that durable.”If you think that climate change is the greatest environmental threat to humanity you might find this observation from the book sobering: “Three times in the past 100000 years glaciers have scraped New York clean. Unless humankind’s Faustian affair with carbon fuels ends up tipping the atmosphere past the point of no return and runaway global warming transfigures Earth into Venus at some unknown date glaciers will do so again.”“The World Without Us” paints a fairly grim portrait. (Reviewing the work in The Times Janet Maslin called it “punishingly bleak” while Jennifer Schuessler writing in The Times Book Review described it as “morbidly fascinating.”)A core trait of “The World Without Us” is that it is neither preachy nor sentimental. The closest Mr. Weisman comes to a policy prescription is toward the end of the book where he discusses but does not endorse the idea that human population growth should be curbed to save the planet — a point of view espoused in its most radical form by the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.Mr. Weisman said he did not agree with the aims of the movement (whose motto is “Live long and die out”). “We are a species that does deserve to be here” he said in the interview. “The whole idea of the human race being some cancer or acne on the planet — I don’t buy that.” If anything he said the book affirms the necessity of people he interviewed like hydraulics workers and bridge engineers whose daily work literally keeps New York City standing.Mr. Weisman has done several public readings. Surprisingly he said many readers have said they found the book “oddly comforting and hopeful” in that it argues that humans’ (often destructive) influence on the environment can be reversed with enough time and that life is resilient.“Even if it has to be without us many people — frankly me included — find a measure of peace in the notion that life will go on” Mr. Weisman said.And some readers he added have even found a dark humor in the apocalyptic portrayal.Said Mr. Weisman: “You’d be surprised at the number of New Yorkers who’ve said ‘God I love it when you let nature trash Manhattan.'”
 6022,  1978, a, In evaluating “Between the Wars” a 16‐week series going into syndication this week (Wednesdays at 7:30 on WNEW/Channel 5 in the New York area) dispassionate observers would be hard put to decide which is more “creative”: the programs or the commercials. The “Survey of American Diplomatic History From Versailles to Pearl Harbor” has been produced by Alan Landsburg Productions for Mobil Oil as part of a project called Mobil Showcase. In fact the series was created by Herb Schmertz a Mobil vice president. How and why has a major oil company gone into the business of television production?Ironically it all began with noncommercial or public television. Mobil was one of the first giant corporations to perceive the potential good will and prestige benefits from “underwriting” programs on public TV which was providing relatively small but more educated more affluent and more influential audiences. Mobil has reaped invaluable image puffery from its support of Masterpiece Theater and other public TV projects. But such underwriting is limited and occasionally can be tricky. Mobil had its knuckles rapped publicly for a sports nostalgia series also created by Mr. Schmertz. The series wasn't all that bad but the television schedule hardly needed another sports show especially on public television and the project represented a further suspicious incursion by a corporation into a system that must remain fiercely independent in order to retain credibility.In the meantime while the energy crisis was throwing the oil companies into their own public‐relations crisis Mobil was battling the three major networks about what it might or might not say in its commercials. One solution to all these nagging problems was to create Mobil Showcase for which Mobil would supply both the commercials and the programs. The commercials have been crafted with consummate shrewdness. In some Mobil merely notes its good cultural works such as supporting Masterpiece Theater collecting brownie points the way sinners used to collect after‐life “indulgences” from the Church. In others various persons of note are profiled with open admiration while an unseen announcer makes the facile connection between “the imagination of a genius” and “the imagination of a company.” The concluding kicker: “We respect imagination; we wouldn't be who we are without it.” One such subject is Joan Ganz Cooney indeed a person worth noting but somehow her establishing and operating of the Children's Television Workshop is equated with Mobil's acquisition of Montgomery Ward. The leaps of logic are breathtaking. It almost becomes necessary to pinch oneself as a reminder that Mobil is in the powerful and turbulent business of oil.That leaves the programs. A just‐concluded series called “When Havoc Struck” merely cashed in on the public's partiality toward disasters. Earthquakes hurricanes tornados and the like provided the basic fodder. “Between the Wars” however is considerably more ambitious and demanding. Anthony Potter is the series producer. Eric Sevareid recently retired from CBS News is the host and narrator. Using the brief theme of the famous opening clarinet glissando from George Gershwin's “Rhapsody in Blue” the programs tackle complex issues in an effort to demonstrate that beginning with the peace talks at Versailles the course of our lives was preordained. They examine a record of “mistakes made opportunities lost triumphs as well as tragedies.” Old photographs are combined with newsreel footage on‐location shooting with period sound recordings to recreate occasions and events. In the second installment “The League of Nations: Return to Isolationism” a modern technique is employed as the League of Nations debate is conveyed with artists' sketches overlaying the actual voices of Henry Cabot Lodge and William Borah.

 5374,  1987, a, ''As soon as I heard the record I caught the songwriting fever once and for all and decided I belonged on Tin Pan Alley - you couldn't tear me away from the profession after that'' he said.Mr. Parish estimates he collaborated with at least a hundred different composers over the years. Though his writing techniques have varied from situation to situation his approach toward lyrics has been quick and intuitive.''In many cases I was given both a tune and a title'' he said. ''Sometimes I would write a 'dummy' lyric with words that didn't mean anything in order to get the rhythmic flow. Then I would come up with the actual words. Occasionally a dummy lyric ends up being the final lyric. Irving Caesar's 'Tea for Two' is a famous example.''Once I had a title I would take it home walk around with it for awhile to let it percolate and then sit down to write. The actual writing time was usually a half hour to an hour. I didn't believe in laboring over a lyric too much because the song would sound too worked over.''Mr. Parish found working with a predetermined title to be a nuisance albeit one that sometimes yielded artistic dividends. In the lyrics of both ''Star Dust'' and ''Sophisticated Lady'' the actual song titles aren't repeated in the catch phrases of the chorus but occur almost incidentally in the narrative helping to sustain the smooth natural flow of imagery. The lyric of ''Star Dust'' is especially striking in the way the verse seems to begin in the middle of a thought: ''. . .And now the purple dust of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart.''The history of ''Star Dust'' illustrates Mr. Parish's belief that songs that are overnight sensations tend to be quickly forgotten while those that come to be recognized as standards often have a longer quieter gestation in the public consciousness.Hoagy Carmichael wrote and recorded the melody for ''Star Dust'' in 1927 as a jazz instrumental heavily influenced by Bix Beiderbecke. Mr. Parish wrote the lyric in 1929 and it became a hit the following year in a recording by Isham Jones the tenor saxophonist bandleader and songwriter (''I'll See You in My Dreams'' ''It Had to Be You'') who led one of the most popular orchestras of the pre-swing era. The following year Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong also had minor hit versions of the song.

 1992,  2007, a, Can anyone make heads or tails of this? Why does the N.F.L. care that a church wants to use a 12-foot-wide projector to show the Super Bowl?The full article from The Indianapolis Star is here.An excerpt follows:The thousands of churches across the country that want to host Super Bowl parties Sunday night had better not pull out big-screen TVs or they could face the wrath of NFL attorneys. For groups that want to host Super Bowl parties — other than sports bars and businesses that normally show televised sports — here are rules the NFL says must be followed: • No admission fees (even to pay for snacks). • Only one television (55 inches or smaller). • No use of the words “Super Bowl” in promotional materials. • No exhibition of the game in connection with events “that promote a message.” The NFL is telling Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis that the church’s plans to use a wall projector to show the game at a party for church members and guests would violate copyright laws.NFL officials spotted a promotion of Fall Creek’s “Super Bowl Bash” on the church Web site last week and sent pastor John D. Newland a letter — via FedEx overnight — demanding the party be canceled.Initially the league objected to the church’s plan to charge partygoers a fee to attend and that the church used the license-protected words “Super Bowl” in its promotions.Newland told the NFL his church would not charge partygoers — the fee had been intended only to pay for snacks — and that it would drop the use of the forbidden words.But the NFL wouldn’t bite. It objected to the church’s plans to use a projector to show the game on what effectively was a 12-foot-wide screen. It said the law limits the church to one TV no bigger than 55 inches.The league even took exception to the church’s plan to influence nonmembers with a video highlighting the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith.P.S. About that last sentence: We can’t have any “promotional messages” that divert attention from the commercials can we?Also: Slate weighs in with an article titled “Is My Super Bowl Party Illegal?”
 1402,  2011, a, MADISON Wis. — Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany spent about an hour before Nebraska’s debut game in the Big Ten taking pictures with Cornhusker fans.“Thanks for the invite” repeated fan after fan with their tone implying that they were happy to be out of the Big 12.In an interview outside Camp Randall Stadium Delany seemed to relish the scene he had helped create. An estimated 30000 Nebraska fans poured into Madison for the game and they helped make for a boisterous atmosphere.“It’s more than you could hope for in a way” Delany said. “We couldn’t have predicted the teams would open up undefeated.”Delany said it could take five years to know whether the conference realignment frenzy has calmed in a significant way. He maintained that the Big Ten would not change just to change and lamented how a lot of the changes occurred.“It’s not sometimes the decisions that you make that are so key it’s the decisions that you don’t make” he said. “Most injuries are self-inflicted they’re not necessarily inflicted by others. Unfortunately in my view while there’s always been some change it hasn’t really been evolutionary it’s been a little more revolutionary.”Delany said that he sees leagues trying to force stability through increasing exit fees. “Usually those things happen as a result of comfort not necessarily to ensure comfort and stability” he said.

Corrigan unpacks 12 essential phrases from “I don’t know” to “I love you” that as she puts it “turn the wheel of life.”& NoteworthyIn which we ask colleagues at The Times what they’re reading now.“The last time I read PERSONAL HISTORY by Katharine Graham was in 2015 after almost nine years of working for The Washington Post her newspaper. What struck me most then though was her description of her young adulthood in the nation’s capital and the ‘legions of young men in Washington who grouped together to live in houses.’ Katharine Meyer and Philip L. Graham met at a group-house party in D.C.! I had suffered through so many myself and mostly what I got were in-person recitations of funny things people had said on Twitter. I’m reading her book for a third time now after being predictably charmed by the new movie ‘The Post.’ It is remarkable to watch Meryl Streep as Graham decide to publish the Pentagon Papers then read that decision rendered in Graham’s own words. By the time you reach that point in the book she has talked candidly about pregnancy loss personal friendships with several presidents her husband’s suicide — and the way she made history in a job she was never really expected to have. Maybe that would have been too long a movie but it’s worth treating yourself to the source material.”— Rachel Dry editor of Sunday Review

 3481,  1999, a, On the first day of his trial on treason charges the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan apologized for his past and said he would call for an end to guerrilla violence if the Turkish authorities would give him the chance to turn his army into a civilian political party.Speaking with rising emotion Mr. Ocalan admitted that he and his fighters were responsible for all the killings and other acts attributed to them by prosecutors and added ''I could list many more you haven't mentioned.'' But he said he had come to believe that his approach to solving the country's ethnic problems was ''a dead-end street.''''Now is the time to end this conflict or else it will get much worse'' he said. ''I want to dedicate my life to bringing Turks and Kurds together.''There have long been complaints from Kurds a distinct ethnic group in Turkey and neighboring countries about official suppression of their language and culture. The Kurdish guerrillas have been at war with the Turkish Government for 15 years a struggle that according to various estimates has taken more than 30000 lives and cost Ankara $100 billion.

 4754,  1991, a, Iraq has very little money to pay war reparations and had overdue debts to many creditors even before it invaded Kuwait current and former United States Government officials and other experts say.The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Oct. 29 that made Iraq liable for war damage and losses suffered by Kuwait and other countries. When President Bush specified Wednesday the allies' conditions for a permanent cease-fire he included Baghdad's "acceptance in principle of Iraq's responsibility to pay compensation for the loss damage and injury its aggression has caused."Iraq said Wednesday that it would comply with all 12 resolutions.But forcing Iraq to pay reparations will be difficult given its lack of money and will conflict with other American interests said Richard W. Murphy a former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. Empty Coffers Influence WarIraq's near-empty treasury has been a cause of the war and an obstacle to its conclusion.On Feb. 15 when Iraq first said it would consider negotiating a withdrawal one condition was the cancellation of its foreign debts and thoseof neighbors who had not assisted the allied war effort.

 5215,  1988, a, Colleen Walker was sitting in a tent two summers ago describing in detail her every golf shot to reporters at the Mastercard International Pro-Am. She was recounting her final round explaining how for the first time she had placed second in a Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour event.Walker then in her fifth year on the Tour was relieved at having finally made some money at the game she so diligently worked on as a youth. But her relief soon turned to shock as she noticed a scoring error on her card a card she already had made official with her signature. Walker turned herself in forfeiting an $18000 payday.''I was going over my card with the press when I noticed I had written down a 5 for the 16th hole'' Walker recalled. ''On that hole I hit a tree on my second shot. I just forgot I did it. I really had a 6. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't turn myself in.''Ironically three weeks earlier Walker lost $2000 for signing an incorrect scorecard at the du Maurier Classic in Toronto. In less than a month Walker who earned $44000 the entire 1985 season had thrown away almost half of that because of mistakes with a pencil.

 2494,  2005, a, W.H. Auden is one of those poets who has a poem for every mood and for a surprising number of occasions too. For those about to undertake a lecture tour the poem to turn to is “On the Circuit” which he wrote after undertaking a tour at the behest of his lecture agency Columbia-Giesen-Management. Auden describes sitting in his plane being whisked off to various destinations in fulfilment of his agency’s “unfathomable will.” This tour he tells us exposes him to various excruciating experiences including “girl organists in bars” (these must surely have largely disappeared) and reading Conrad Hilton’s “Be My Guest” (this has not disappeared). What makes it bearable for Auden though is coming across the odd delightful face or a chance meeting with a Tolkien addict. And at the end of the day as he implies in the poem’s final line he is being paid to do it.I have just returned from a lecture tour of the United States and Auden’s poem comes naturally to mind. Columbia-Giesen-Management seems to be no longer but the unfathomable will I was obeying was that of a fine organization called the Stephen Barclay Agency of Petaluma California. Actually its will makes perfect sense and is expressed in beautifully-detailed documents setting out every step of my criss-crossing of the United States. You will start I am told in Austin from where you will go to Waco. There then follows a long list of cities from Syracuse to Santa Barbara.As the tour progresses the days begin to blur. And blur affects the hotels too which start to fade into one another although sometimes a truly exceptional carpet pattern leaps out or a bellman says something memorable. So many hotels these days are quite undistinguishable from one another and have been designed it would seem to obliterate any sense of the local and any element of soul; one ends up then remembering the good places and forgetting the rest. Slight eccentricities or idiosyncrasies perhaps are what makes a hotel memorable. If you are in Portland Oregon you must stay in The Heathman and take a look at their doorman in his curious Beefeater costume and hat covered with flowers. And if you go into their bar wear your kilt (as I did) and you will find that your drinks are bought for you. It is a most hospitable place.But then but then … some hotels are less accommodating. In upstate New York I stayed in a hotel where there was a traumatic tomato incident. I was I hasten to point out the innocent party and it all began when I decided to have a simple breakfast. Now I know that as a Scotsman I pronounce certain things the wrong way (from an American perspective) even if it is the right way in the streets of Edinburgh. So I asked for scrambled eggs – pronounced the same way on both sides on the Atlantic – and a sliced uncooked tomato. I was careful to say “tomayto” (American and right) rather than “tomarto” (British and utterly laughable and unintelligible). When the waitress therefore looked at me sternly and said that I could not have the tomato it had nothing to do with my having committed the offense of being British in a built-up area.I reeled under the rebuff. I did not think that it was an unreasonable request given that the kitchen shelves were probably groaning under the weight of tomatoes. But no she said that I could not have a tomato because the combination of scrambled eggs and tomato did not exist. In a state of shock I settled for scrambled eggs and toast but five minutes later she returned and said to me quite straight-faced “You can have the tomato after all.” I thanked her and she acknowledged the thanks.I am all in favor of rules but there are some circumstances in which they become tyrannical. There must be a rule against substitution in menus. Presumably after the manager was consulted the use of a tomato was approved. It was such a tiny thing but these matters can sometimes be representative of far greater issues.Tomatoes were liberally available in Austin at the gala dinner kicking off the Texas Book Festival. That was a splendid affair at which I had been invited to speak along with the historian David McCullough among others. At drinks beforehand Mr. McCullough told a story of the sort one hears rather often today – that he appeared to be on some list which made him the subject of particularly stringent security checks at airports. He had no idea how he ended up on that list where the list was or how to get off it. This makes one think of both Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Mikado” (“I’ve got a little list! I’ve got a little list!”) and the novels of Franz Kafka (what list?). McCullough revealed that on some occasions he appears to be lower down the list than usual and is given only a perfunctory extra going-over. I suggested that this was in a curious way a bit insulting and that he should ask for an upgrade in his classification.There were other people there – almost a thousand in fact. One who stood out was the remarkable Kinky Freidman with whom I had a very brief conversation. I did not exactly get what he said (he pronounces tomato in a strange way) perhaps because he was talking with a large unlit cigar in his mouth. He stood out of course by virtue of the fact that he was dressed entirely in black and wore a large Texan hat also black. This was inside of course where nobody else was wearing a hat even if it is customary I believe for echt Texans to eat their meals with their hats on. I imagine that Kinky Friedman’s Stetson might have made it difficult for the waitresses who would have had to reach round the very considerable brim to serve his dinner. It might have been easier for them to place the food in the brim of the hat thereby enabling Mr. Friedman to reach up and take items out when required.In case you don’t know Kinky Friedman an irreverent musician-turned-writer is standing for the post of governor of Texas. Like all the other authors at the festival I was invited to breakfast in the governor’s mansion where we were greeted by the governor himself who wore no hat. I did not see Mr. Friedman at this breakfast. It may be that he thought it would be embarrassing for his host if he saw one of the guests measuring up the furniture and mentally planning how to re-arrange it. If Mr. Friedman were to find himself in the governor’s mansion – on a long-term basis that is – the parties would be lively. Probably not breakfast though which I suspect is not his style.But if I entertained any thoughts that the voters of Texas might elect Mr. Friedman these were dispelled when I continued on to Waco.

 187,  2018, a, Our April pick for the PBS NewsHour-New York Times book club “Now Read This” is Dan Egan’s “The Death and Life of the Great Lakes.” It’s an epic and wonderfully told story of history science and reportage about the largest source of freshwater in the world and the threat to America’s waterways. Become a member of the book club by joining our Facebook group or by signing up to our newsletter. Learn more about the book club here.Below are questions to help guide your discussions as you read the book over the next month. You can also submit your own questions for Dan Egan on our Facebook page which he will answer on the NewsHour broadcast at the end of the month.1. The five great lakes — Lake Erie Superior Michigan Huron and Ontario — make up the world’s largest freshwater system. Some 40 million people live near their shores and many more of us depend on them for fresh drinking water work or recreation. What’s been your own experience of the Great Lakes?2. In the book’s opening Egan writes that more than any ordinary lake each of the Great Lakes “can hold all the mysteries of an ocean and then some.” He mentions that there are 6000 shipwrecks many of which have never been found at the bottom of the Great Lakes. What other mysteries are you learning about as you read?

 7471,  1964, a, Recognizing a smallmouth bass from a largemouth bass is easy if the angler has one of each kind in hand. But if not it should be remembered that a vertical line drawn through the eye of a bass will pass behind the mouth of a smallmouth. It will pass through the mouth of a largemouth.Another and surer method is to count the number of rows of scales from the median line of the dorsal fin on the back. The median line runs along the side from the mouth to the tail.On a smallmouth there will be 11 rows because its scales are smaller than the largemouth which will have seven rows.Other fish to be sorted out include the pickerel pike and muskellunge. First of all the misnamed pike is not a pike at all but a member of the perch family. It differs from the others in that it has two separate dorsal fins. Its eyes have a glassy look; hence the name.The pickerel has scales all over the cheek and the gill covers.The pike often called the northern or great northern will have scales on the cheek like the pickerel but on the gill cover only the upper half will be scaled.
 689,  2015, a, Por Laurie Goodstein y Jim YardleyEl jueves de la semana pasada tras una mañana ajetreada en la que habló ante el Congreso de Estados Unidos y compartió con indigentes en un almuerzo al aire libre el Papa Francisco se retiró a la Embajada del Vaticano en Washington custodiada por estrictas medidas de seguridad. Según los funcionarios del Vaticano el papa tomaría una “breve siesta” antes de volar a Nueva York para la segunda etapa de su viaje por Estados Unidos.Pero el papa de 78 años no solo tomó una siesta esa tarde. También tuvo tiempo para una reunión privada con Kim Davis una secretaria de un condado de Kentucky considerada un héroe por los conservadores religiosos porque prefirió ir a la cárcel antes que emitir licencias de matrimonio a parejas del mismo sexo.Ni una sola palabra se filtró sobre el encuentro de Francisco con Davis; nisiquiera cuando un reportero de televisión estadounidense le preguntó al papa durante la conferencia de prensa en el vuelo hacia Roma cuál era su opinión sobre los funcionarios públicos que se niegan a cumplir su trabajo por objeciones religiosas al matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo. Esta pregunta fue una clara referencia a Davis pero ni el reportero ni el papa mencionaron su nombre.“La objeción de conciencia es un derecho que es parte de cada derecho humano” respondió Francisco aunque añadió que no podía hablar sobre casos específicos.Seis días después del encuentro furtivo con Davis en la embajada el míercoles pasado un vocero del Vaticano confirmó que la reunión había ocurrido pero no ofreció mayores detalles.Por casi ocho horas funcionarios del Vaticano se negaron a confirmar o negar la reunión; pero finalmente lo confirmaron en la tarde del miércoles.

 1664,  2009, a, What we’re reading (and watching) on Wednesday morning.Gimme a head with hair: In today’s New York Times Ben Brantley assesses the long long long-in-the-works Broadway transfer of “Hair” whose seeds were sown in a 2007 concert performance and a 2008 production at the Delacorte Theater writing that the latest cast is “tearing down the house in the production that opened on Tuesday night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater. And any theatergoer with a pulse will find it hard to resist their invitation to join the demolition crew. This emotionally rich revival of ‘The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical’ from 1967 delivers what Broadway otherwise hasn’t felt this season: the intense unadulterated joy and anguish of that bi-polar state called youth.” Writing for Bloomberg News Jeremy Gerard says of the “Hair” revival that “for all its references to hippies Vietnam free love and the revolution feels utterly of the moment in its exuberance its power to involve and in Diane Paulus’s entrancing production to move us.” But in the Boston Globe Louise Kennedy writes that the show “has not to put it mildly aged well. What may once have seemed winningly ingenuous and gently rebellious now feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib. The antiwar sentiments of the show are still painfully relevant but uselessly one-dimensional and beyond that there’s . . . what? Drug jokes sex jokes squares-vs.-hippie jokes and a lot of other stuff that must have sounded a little corny even the first time around.”In a global recession do moviegoers want films about the joys or the horrors of unfettered capitalism? Even Hollywood isn’t sure: Variety reports that a new film version of Jay McInerney’s novel “Bright Lights Big City” about a disillusioned writer in class-conscious New York is in the works to be directed by Josh Schwartz the creator of “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” Meanwhile The Hollywood Reporter says that Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” will also be made into a movie. Angelina Jolie Charlize Theron Julia Roberts and Anne Hathaway are among the actors on the short list to play the fictional railroad executive Dagny Taggart.Our favorite headline announcing the US Postal Service’s decision to issue stamps based on “The Simpsons” comes from BBC News: “Millions of Americans urged to lick Homer Simpson.” Not only is it a bizarre image but most American stamps are now self-adhesive.Anticipating Conan O’Brien’s summer transition to the “Tonight” show when he’ll be rejoined by his longtime second banana Andy Richter Slate’s Troy Patterson declares Mr. Richter “the best late-night-show sidekick of all time” writing: “Too square to be hip too well-kempt for slob comedy and too principled to pander Richter exudes a normalness that renders him a misfit. But though as wholesome as Garrison Keillor on the surface he is as weird as anybody. In the moments that require his zaniest self he suggests a subtle Chris Farley with the crucial difference of seeming to prefer malted milkshakes to speedballs.”And since we suspect we won’t have it to kick around for much longer here’s a highlight reel from the new Fox variety show “Osbournes: Reloaded” which had its 25-minute premiere after “American Idol” on Tuesday night:

 4034,  1996, a, Mr. Gore who had a fatal heart attack in 1986 while hiking set the policy that no more than 200 people should work under one roof. One day in 1965 when he was walking through his flourishing plant he realized he no longer knew everyone. From that came the growth strategy to ''get big by staying small.''''The physical 'feel' of the company's buildings has always been very important to the whole Gore family'' said Mr. Hill who started with the Gores 36 years ago in the basement of the Gore home. ''We want our employees to feel good about where they work. We spend more on our cafeterias than we do on our lobbies.''Gore's president the 59-year-old Robert W. Gore the son of the founder was the creator of the Gore-Tex technology. He often walks the sites taking an interest in details down to the plantings.Mr. Hill said the under-200 strategy costs more in terms of land and overhead since each building must have its own cafeteria conference room and loading docks. It also requires that each location have a receptionist a custodial staff and personnel director.He said the policy probably cost Gore at least 20 percent more for its buildings than would a conventional real estate program. But the gains in efficiency flexibility and teamwork more than offset the extra expense Mr. Hill said.''I think our track record has proven it works'' he said. ''We really do think of ourselves as a small company.''As a privately held company with most of the stock held in a trust set up by the Gores the company has the flexibility to make decisions based on a longer-term outlook Mr. Gore said.

 6262,  1973, a, During the course of the meeting the incredible number of problems related to skunk ‐ keeping were outlined:¶The city forbids keeping certain wild animals — the skunk among them — In the home even when they are bred to be pets. The maximum penalty is $1000 fine or one‐year imprisonment or both but there have been no recent prosecutions.(Keeping a skunk elsewhere in the state when not prohibited by the locality is legal with a state permit that costs $1. Wendy Winsted who works for a veterinarian and is the club's founder instructs club members to obtain this permit in the belief that it overrides the city legislation. The City Health Department says that it doesn't. In any case for fear of the city many members would not reveal their last names for publication.)•¶A skunk once its glands are removed is defenseless in the wild. So if the little creature's depredations around the house and need for attention (at least an hour of handling daily) become too much for the owner there remains an enormous moral responsibility not to release it in the woods.¶Skunks are nocturnal and stay up all night unless they are “switched.” One member Terry explained that she was trying to keep her skunk up all day so he'd sleep all night but so far he was only “half switched” which is to say he wakes her up “every single morning at 6.”¶A skunk fed too much during the summer will follow his natural inclination come winter and hibernate —under the bed in the linen closet.¶The animal in the wild foiages for food using its long dull claws to dig up dirt in search of insects and such. Around the home flower pots resemble the woods. Ann a skunk‐owner of only a few months came home recently to “spend hours and hours cleaning up the mess. It was awful!” Incidentally while it might be helpful if they ate insects around the house most of the skunks are fed cat food.¶The skunk can be trained to use a kitty litter box but the schooling takes a great deal of patience and frequently goes awry. “He has a very nice kitty box” one member said “and he goes in that general area.”

 4655,  1992, a, Detroit LionsQuarterback Rodney Peete and the Lions resolved their contract differences. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed but the Lions said the contract was dependent upon Peete's passing his physical. A starter since his rookie season in 1989 Peete a sixth-round draft choice from the University of Southern California missed the last half of the 1991 season and the playoffs after tearing his Achilles' tendon. Seattle SeahawksThe Seahawks reeled in the big one coming to terms on a four-year deal with their 300-pound first-round draft choice Ray Roberts an offensive tackle from Virginia. Roberts (No. 10 over all in the 1992 draft) is expected to sign today leaving only one missing rookie wide receiver Michael Bates a sixth-round (No. 151) pick from Arizona. Bates has been excused from camp. He is on the United States Olympic track team as a 200-meter man. Denver BroncosIt's not that quarterback John Elway won't have any friends to throw to but after bidding adios to Ricky Nattiel (traded to Tampa Bay) and Vance Johnson (out for three months with a shoulder tear) the Broncos' Three Amigos are down to one Mark Jackson.The team's receiving corps has been further depleted by off-season back surgery to wide receiver Michael Young who is expected to miss most of training camp and a broken ankle suffered last Saturday by running back Steve Sewell a favorite Elway target on third down.

 5636,  1986, a, Mr. Ho takes the wrapper in one hand and with a table knife scoops up shrimp filling to place on the wrapper while pleating the back of the dough. Others are making shu mai another dumpling that is made plain or topped with half a quail egg. As they work the staff members chat in Cantonese. In the background a radio broadcasts a Cantonese-dialect program. ''It's a Chinese love story'' a woman says.At 10:20 A.M. lunch is served in the entryway overlooking 14th Street (breakfast often fried rice or rice noodles is at 7). The meal has two delicious entrees: Chinese hairy melon beef balls and Chinese mushrooms poached in broth and a spicy dish of tender beef sauteed with a Sichuan mustard green whose thick knobby stem is preserved with salt and minced hot chili pepper.At 11:30 the Rheon encrusting machine a Japanese invention is turned on so that the roast pork buns can be made - 30 a minute. One cook puts 25 pounds of fully risen dough into a large professional mixer for a minute and scooping it up runs across the room and feeds it into one side of the machine. In another opening he adds the roast pork filling.For a moment nothing seems to happen. ''Wait'' the cook says. In silence deep within the machine dough is being pushed around a hollow corkscrew being shaped into a tube while inside the hollow filling is being pushed down. Both dough and filling are extruded simultaneously and dropped through two revolving disks that mold and cut perfect spheres. The stuffed buns are allowed to rise for 45 minutes and then are steamed cooled and the next day packed and frozen. H.S.F. produces more than 2000 buns a day.As the buns drop gently onto a conveyor belt Mr. Ho is in the kitchen inventing a new dim sum variation. At the moment more than 100 are available at the H.S.F. restaurants. The standard menu pictures 48 dim sum although visitors find two or three new items. EATING YOUR FILL 7 DAYS A WEEK THESE are some of the restaurants offering dozens of varieties of dim sum seven days a week in addition to their regular menus.

 4388,  1994, a, The Green Point Savings Bank of Flushing Queens said yesterday that it had settled a series of lawsuits by depositors challenging the bank's conversion to public stock ownership.Under the settlement the bank will send depositors a coupon for $500 off the closing costs of a mortgage and offer them the right to invest in a five-and-a-half-year certificate of deposit with an interest rate that is 65/100 of a percentage point higher than the bank is providing on its five-year account.Green Point will also pay the lawyers for the depositors fees of as much as $3.9 million and a further $150000 in expenses. Terms of the settlement and lawyers' fees must be approved in Federal Court in Brooklyn at a hearing on Dec. 12."This is the close of the final chapter of the conversion" said Rich Humphrey a senior vice president of Green Point. The bank says it has done nothing wrong but is settling the suit to avoid litigation.

 2675,  2004, a, Because the personal retirement accounts are tied to the workers not the employers workers can take their accounts with them when they move to other jobs keeping the labor market flexible. The system does not penalize or subsidize immigrants who receive what they have contributed even if they return to their homelands. We set three basic policy rules for the transition to personal accounts: the government guaranteed retirees that their benefits would not be affected by the reform; everyone already in the work force could stay in the government system or move to the personal retirement account system (those who opted out were given a "recognition bond" calculated to reflect the money the worker had already accrued); and all new workers were required to enter the personal account system.With this system we ended the illusion that both the employer and the worker contribute to retirement. As economists know well all the contributions are ultimately paid by workers since employers take into account all labor costs in making their hiring and salary decisions. To protect the net wages of workers we initially recategorized the employer's contribution as an additional gross wage.There was no "economic" transition cost because there is no harm to the gross domestic product from this reform (on the contrary there is a huge benefit). A completely different issue is how to confront the "cash flow" transition cost to the government of recognizing and ultimately eliminating the unfinanced Social Security liability. The implicit debt of the Chilean system in 1980 was about 80 percent of the G.D.P.We used five "sources" to generate that cash flow: a) one-time long-term government bonds at market rates of interest so the cost was shared with future generations; b) a temporary residual payroll tax; c) privatization of state-owned companies which increased efficiency prevented corruption and spread ownership; d) a budget surplus deliberately created before the reform (for many years afterward we were able to use the need to "finance the transition" as a powerful argument to contain increases in government spending); e) increased tax revenues that resulted from the higher economic growth fueled by the personal retirement account system.Since the system started on May 1 1981 the average real return on the personal accounts has been 10 percent a year. The pension funds have now accumulated resources equivalent to 70 percent of gross domestic product a pool of savings that has helped finance economic growth and spurred the development of liquid long-term domestic capital market. By increasing savings and improving the functioning of both the capital and labor markets the reform contributed to the doubling of the growth rate of the economy from 1985 to 1997 (from the historic 3 percent to 7.2 percent a year) until the slowdown caused by the government's erroneous response to the Asian crisis.Personal accounts have become the "third rail" of Chilean politics and the system has been accepted and even marginally improved by the three center-left governments of the last 14 years. But it must be said that some labor market problems have increased unemployment and short-term labor contracts reducing participation in the system and making the future safety net more expensive to maintain.When the system was inaugurated one-fourth of the eligible work force signed up in the first month. Today 95 percent of covered workers participate. For Chileans their retirement accounts represent real property rights. Indeed the accounts not risky government promises are the primary sources of security for retirement and the typical Chilean worker's main asset is not his used car or even his small house (probably still mortgaged) but the capital in his retirement account.

 1234,  2012, a, PhotoWallowing in mood over event moment over entirety “North Sea Texas” demands complete surrender to the maturing of Pim (Jelle Florizoone) a sensitive 14-year-old trapped in a tiny Belgian coastal town.“The boy lives in a world of his own” opines Pim’s accordion-playing restlessly disappointed single mother Yvette (Eva Van Der Gucht). Sealed in that world Pim surreptitiously spritzes Yvette’s perfume and crushes painfully on his leather-jacketed best friend Gino (Mathias Vergels). Burning looks in the garden shed lead to experimentation in a pup tent but when Gino a floppy-haired charmer takes his experiments across the aisle heartbreak is not far behind.Directed by Bavo Defurne (working from a novel by André Sollie) “North Sea Texas” is calm and rapt — no hysterical adolescent passions here — a simmering drama powered by fully drawn characters and fine performances. And with its indeterminate period setting and tarnished-sunlight glow (courtesy of the gifted cinematographer Anton Mertens) the film has a delicate dreamlike quality that’s quite affecting. But Pim’s withdrawn demeanor and inability to verbalize his emotions — the character is basically one big ache — make it more challenging than it should be to immerse ourselves in his journey.North Sea Texas Director Bavo DefurneWriters Bavo Defurne Yves VerbraekenStars Ben Van den Heuvel Eva van der Gucht Thomas Coumans Katelijne Damen Nathan NaenenRating Not RatedRunning Time 1h 34mGenres Drama RomanceMovie data powered by IMDb.comLast updated: Nov 2 2017

 486,  2016, a, Dear Diary:Recent news coverage regarding a documentary about the film director Brian De Palma reminded me of the day in 1970 when he and Robert De Niro came to our I.M. Pei faculty/grad student building at New York University on Bleecker Street (now called Silver Towers).The film called “Hi Mom” continued the story of the antihero in “Greetings” who was now a peeping Tom. My apartment was the object of his obsession since it was opposite their other site on Greene Street.Mr. De Niro was handsome and polite and smiled at our 6-month-old. Mr. De Palma shrugged around our place checking camera angles. I think we got $100 and moved out for 24 hours.When we came back they were still working on a scene with the actress Jennifer Salt who was in a flimsy robe and getting ready to reshoot a nude scene in our bathtub. She was apologizing/explaining to my young wife about how acting and real life were not necessarily the same.

Graham the Hartford lawyer who represented the mother Kathy DeCorleto. “He pulled a gun on her and pointed it at her head.“He was just visiting with Frankie for like a couple of days a week. One time he just didn't return Frankie. She was just afraid to fight back.“It wasn't just simply that she gave up after a year of fighting. She was really worn down from that battle.”

 2901,  2002, a, At the hearing Judge Nickerson who has since died said ''It would be unrealistic to suppose'' that the defense lawyers who would benefit from a $10 million contract ''would be indifferent to the welfare of the P.B.A.''In their decision yesterday the appeals judges said Mr. Worth's divided loyalties became evident with the defense strategy he used at trial. He insisted to the jurors that Justin A. Volpe the police officer who pleaded guilty to the assault had acted alone.Prosecutors have always argued that it was clear that other officers took Mr. Louima to the precinct and that at least one led Mr. Louima to the bathroom where the assault took place and held him down.In the 68-page ruling written by Chief Judge John M. Walker Jr. he and Judges Jose A. Cabranes and Chester J. Straub said that Mr. Worth doggedly pursued the assertion that Mr. Volpe had acted alone a defense that Judge Nickerson later described as ''fanciful.''Implicating a second officer the judges said yesterday would have been a plausible alternative defense strategy but they said Mr. Worth had a reason for avoiding it. They said implicating a second would have given Mr. Louima ammunition for the claims in his civil suit that there was a conspiracy involving numerous officers and a cover-up.''Casting Volpe as an aberrant officer who acted alone on the other hand'' the judges said ''would likely have been consistent with any defense advanced in the civil case.''Mr. Volpe pleaded guilty in the midst of the trial. The decision yesterday said Mr. Volpe's lawyer then told Mr. Worth that Mr. Volpe ''can take your guy out of the bathroom'' meaning that he could clear Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Volpe's lawyer told Mr. Worth that his client would testify that it was another officer who had taken Mr. Louima to the bathroom. Still the judges said Mr. Worth persisted with his assertions to the jury that Mr. Volpe had acted alone and he did not call Mr. Volpe to the stand.

 646,  2015, a, PhotoTHURSDAY PUZZLE — Every now and then I have this anxiety dream where something truly bizarre happens to The New York Times crossword puzzle on its way from Will Shortz’s desk to the print paper or the Internet. A lot of tricky stuff has to happen to get your puzzles to you including getting them past the EMUs in one piece so it’s not that far-fetched to think that my brain might worry about what might happen if say parts of the clues suddenly disappeared.What’s that you say? The clues really have disappeared? Oh that. That’s what we call a design feature not a flaw. Today’s puzzle by Timothy Polin makes good use of the phrase INVISIBLE INK by giving us the first letter of the theme clues and leaving us to figure out how those letters relate to the answers.For example we have the letter K as the sole clue at 18 Across and the answer is ECCENTRICITY. What does the letter K have to do with ECCENTRICITY? Well if you have already solved the revealer at 67 Across you know that we’re dealing with INVISIBLE INK. That INK has disappeared from the clue which would be “Kink” if we weren’t in the middle of one of my anxiety dreams. Kink of course is a synonym for ECCENTRICITY. Similarly “Fink” is a synonym for STOOL PIGEON (53 Across). I got held up at the S at 12 Down because I couldn’t figure out how FOUNDER was a synonym for “Sink” and thought it was incorrect. I asked Mr. Polin about this and I’m told that FOUNDER is a nautical term that means to fill up with water and sink.So now that we all acknowledge that the clues aren’t really missing I can relax and tell you that the Clue(s) of the day for me were “Frank refusal?” for NEIN and “Tough pill to swallow” for LOZENGE.Let’s see what Mr. Polin has to say for himself:Constructor’s NotesInspiration sometimes finds you in the strangest places. The phrase INVISIBLE INK had been stuck in my head for a long time but I’d never been able to wrangle it into a good crossword theme. Last May I even submitted a Sunday-sized puzzle with a completely different theme based on the same phrase which was rejected mercifully for a number of good reasons. It wasn’t until coming back from dropping someone off at the airport early one morning this past January semi-delirious from lack of sleep that I had this sudden insight: Tim you moron. Make the INK invisible in the clues not in the grid. Duh. O.K. so I have a pretty simple word game. You can convert one of this puzzle’s six theme answers into an equally viable answer for the same clue by altering (no adding or subtracting) just one letter. Can you figure it out? I’ll post the answer on XWord Info. Good luck!So let that be a lesson to all you aspiring constructors out there: When in doubt swap the clues for the entries. You never know what might work.Mr. Polin and I both agreed that a good video for this post would be a certain scene from Monty Python’s “Life of Brian” that speaks of “derring-do.” Unfortunately that scene is not standards-friendly but you are more than welcome to look it up. It features Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate and Graham Chapman as his friend with the name that cannot be written here.Since we can’t post that bit of hilarity let’s go in the opposite direction and listen to the actor and director ANDRE Gregory tell Wallace Shawn about reality in the 1981 film “My Dinner With ANDRE.”Your thoughts?

 4442,  1993, a, As they gained a clearer sense of the obstacles they face from the lack of heat to the 1.8 million gallons of water in the basement officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday that it would be more than a week before they fully revive what amount to the heart lungs and nervous system of the World Trade Center.Last night the heating ventilation communication and fire alarm systems of the massive complex were still dead. The Vista Hotel perched on slender columns above the blast area was still unsecured -- although engineers said they had assembled all the materials and plans they needed to begin the job by yesterday morning.As the 35-foot steel tubes they planned to use to support the columns sat in a pile near the Vista Hotel engineers waited for a go-ahead from investigators who had cordoned off the area of the explosion as a crime scene. Yesterday evening Eugene Fasullo the Port Authority's chief engineer said he had not yet received permission to begin the job which could take two days although he expected it at any time.In most of the complex communications ventilation air-conditioning heating and fire and smoke alarm systems themselves were not damaged but their "nerve center" was destroyed said Robert DiChiara assistant director of the World Trade Department of the Port Authority.

''I don't think it's a career-ending injury but it's enough that we don't feel comfortable about taking him out there and running him this weekend.''Baffert said that he had Wimbledon jog and that he was all right.''He's not sore but I had a vet come in there and look at it and there is something going on there'' Baffert said. ''It's probably not that bad right now but if we were to go out there and run him then you can really hurt him.''

 6342,  1970, a, VIENTIANE Laos Jan. 31— The United States is planning an evacuation of thousands of civilians in the Plaine des Jarres next week in the expectation of a counteroffensive by Commu nist forces.The Defense Ministry spokes man Col. Thongphanh Knoksy told newsmen that the Laotian military expected the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces to open a major attack no later than mid‐February.American officials and most diplomatic and military observ ers from other countries agree that an offensive is likely. They expect the Communist forces to recapture the embattled region in central Laos which they lost last summer after having con trolled it for more than five years. The conquest of the strategic Plains des Jarres was the most notable victory by the Royal Laotian Government in many years and military morale in this battered country still thrives on it.10000 Are InvolvedThe evacuation will involve 10000 to 15000 displaced per sons who were settled in the Plaine des Jarres after being evacuated early last summer during fighting near Xieng khouang in the southeast.

 2304,  2006, a, A Decorator Show House for More Than ShowA new apartment building in the Bronx — the subject of an article on Thursday — was built for families whose primary caregiver has H.I.V. The interiors were designed to be the antithesis of dreary hospital decor and were decorated in part by editors of Domino the design magazine.To what extent does one’s home environment and surroundings play a role in health especially when a serious illness is a factor?Related Article
 4198,  1995, a, The works in the exhibition "David Padilla Cabrera y Linda Matalon" are visually very different but together these two artists make an interestingly textured show at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.Mr. Cabrera's small paintings look abstract but are in fact shot through with autobiographical references many to his childhood in a Chicano community (an identity alluded to in the Spanish conjunction used in the show's title).The bright blue in a series of monochromatic panels is the color of his grandmother's California house and the very name he's given to a cluster of yellow panels painted with green oval shapes -- "Aunt Sara's Rubber Tree Our Lady of Guadalupe" -- suggests a rich complicated fragrance.As in the past Mr. Cabrera's work is disarming in its formal modesty and its subtly stated concerns. Here and there though the new paintings have an unresolved possibly transitional look. To some degree a lack of finish is what they're all about but there's also a sense that good ideas have not yet been pushed as far as they could go.

 5193,  1989, a, If the walls of 273 Water Street N.Y. N.Y. 10004 could talk the dainty would have to block their ears. During its more than 200 years this small brick derelict has been a brothel a home for ''fallen women'' and a saloon called Kit Burns's Sportsman's Hall where bad men paid good money to watch dogs fight rats. It's also seen wars pestilence riots and squatters.And now this Mother Courage of houses the third-oldest building in Manhattan is facing a new challenge. Its new owners who got it at an auction of city properties for $325000 hope to turn it into offices and a ground-floor store.The Captain Rose House was named for the merchant who built it on what was once a riverfront and kept his brig out back. That it outlasted the 18th century let alone the 19th and most of the 20th is a miracle. What British troops didn't destroy the city's frequent fires and constant demolition did.But as is so often the case with survivors each year marked another step down the social ladder for 273 Water Street. What this poor house has had to put up with! Swarms of children bouncing balls off its brick facade before running along for a swim off Coenties Slip. Addicts seeking laudanum in the days when the house was an apothecary shop. Seamen sleeping off last night's grog in the days when it was a hotel. And of course the yapping of dogs and the squeaking of rats and the sobs of those fallen women.

 638,  2015, a, PhotoAfter a big Memorial Day weekend brought a strong end to a record-breaking season Broadway’s box office sales sagged a bit last week.The post-holiday comedown — not unexpected given that fewer tourists were in town — meant that most of the shows vying for Tony Awards saw a drop in grosses. The Tonys will be presented on Sunday.There were still 10 shows that grossed more than $1 million in the week that ended May 31 including the hit plays “Fish in the Dark” and “The Audience”; the new musicals “An American in Paris” “Something Rotten!” “The King and I” and “Finding Neverland”; and four longer-running hits “The Lion King” “Wicked” “Aladdin” and “The Book of Mormon.”But several shows that had topped $1 million the previous week dropped below that mark last week including “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” “Kinky Boots” and “The Phantom of the Opera.”Among the contenders for the best new musical Tony three had news to brag about: “American in Paris” continues to pull in the biggest box office “Something Rotten!” saw the biggest increase in grosses and “Fun Home” had the most packed houses. That show bested even “The Book of Mormon” by reporting 103 percent capacity audiences meaning that not only was every seat taken but there were substantial standing-room attendees as well.The fourth nominee “The Visit” continues to lag at the box office taking in $149023 which is only 20 percent of its potential.The first show to open in the new Broadway season the comedy “An Act of God” written by David Javerbaum and starring Jim Parsons reported a healthy $693379 gross in four previews and four regular performances. That was down from the previous week reflecting the fact that the show gave away tickets on opening night and to critics.

 4501,  1993, a, Question: How can I track the performance of mutual funds that are not listed by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system?Answer: To qualify for a listing with Nasdaq which provides fund data for most newspapers and magazines a fund generally must have either $25 million in assets or 1000 or more shareholders. Today about 3100 funds are Nasdaq-listed and 217 are not according to Morningstar Inc. fund researchers in Chicago.Tracking the performance of nonlisted funds on a daily basis is almost impossible said John Rekenthaler editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds an investing newsletter. Some financial publications however publish weekly quotations and more do so on a quarterly basis.While nonlisted funds tend to be small and relatively new that's not always the case said Gerald W. Perritt editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago. He recommends two no-load growth funds that are small but do have solid histories: Crabbe Huson Special (until recently Crabbe Huson Growth) in Portland Ore. a value fund and the Fasciano Fund in Chicago which owns shares in small companies.

 4964,  1990, a, Gertrud Michelson's ''When a Child Walks Away'' [Opinion Page June 10] evoked a sad nostalgia as I recalled a similar experience not many years after the author's.I was a little older than Gertrud back in the 40's when I ''ran away'' - about 11 years of age. And my trip took me much farther - from Philadelphia to New York.My mother was visiting her mother in New York and I became angry at my father who was home with my brother and me. I raided my bank (public transportation was very reasonable in those days!) and set off by trolley car (a natural means of transportation for an 11-year-old then) for Pennsylvania Station in Philadelphia. In looking back I wonder why I was not questioned at the ticket window; I purchased my ticket and made the trip uneventfully to New York.From there it was just a non-threatening subway ride to 96th and Central Park West and a three-block walk to my grandmother's house - where I was welcomed by a near-hysterical mother and grandmother because my father had called frantically to report my disappearance.

 3380,  2000, a, Some awkward arrangements of his pieces in the early middle game in the 14th encounter of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship gave Vladimir Kramnik trouble yesterday in London but he struggled through to an endgame that was salvageable and got the draw that maintained his two-point lead over Garry Kasparov.With the score now at 8 to 6 in favor of Kramnik he needs only one more draw to win the match and the $1.33 million prize.Kramnik had to drop a pawn but escaped into an ending where that margin was not sufficient to cost him the game.Game 15 is scheduled for tomorrow at 3 p.m. London time.For the first time in the match Kramnik chooses the English Opening of which he has long been a connoisseur and Kasparov meets it with the Double Fianchetto Variation.

 3485,  1999, a, MOST people look at a lettuce and see salad. Designers look at a lettuce and see lettuce green.''What would you think of that color on a chair?'' Richard Schultz a furniture designer asked pointing to the bright floppy head sticking out of the ground in a vegetable garden fenced by tall wire tangled with wild purple roses. A chair in the garden is apple green last month's flavor which the designer chose by walking into a local paint store with an apple in his hand picked from the tree behind his studio.Mr. Schultz 72 has spent the last 45 years getting to know his materials. As much as the metals and plastics that inspire innovation in furniture they are the lettuces leafy ferns the light and shadow and lichened stone walls of the 49-acre 19th-century farm he shares with his wife Trudy.Mr. Schultz is not a gardener. But he has cultivated the outdoors planting designs in the landscape to see if visual relationships will grow.The two small houses barn gardens and pond that sit within a circus of woods have been his laboratory for introducing man-made objects thoughtfully into the most fragile temperamental of settings: nature.

 1941,  2008, a, Mike Lowell was bothered by a torn labrum in his left hip so he had one hit in Boston’s last 11 games. J.D. Drew has been hampered by a strained lower back so he played in only two of the last 38 games.But when the Red Sox opposed the Los Angeles Angels in Game 1 of their division series on Wednesday night Drew was batting fifth and playing right field and Lowell was batting seventh and playing third base. The playoffs are here and the Red Sox hope the two sidelined regulars are ready.“I think J.D. had probably his best day in a while yesterday so that was really good” said Red Sox Manager Terry Francona. “And again there are some off days that help. Mikey Lowell did I don’t want to speak out of turn I think he actually did better than we thought.”Eventhough Drew has been out longer Lowell’s injury seems to be of more concern to the Red Sox. Francona said Boston’s best team has Lowell at third and Kevin Youkilis at first. He joked that Lowell is “not running the 100 meters in the Olympics” and is “not that fast to begin with.”If Lowell’s injury prevents him from scoring from second base on a single Francona said the Red Sox would consider making a change. But Francona stressed that Lowell who was the Most Valuable Player in the World Series last year has earned the right to show whether he can contribute.“This kid has handled so much adversity” Francona said. “This really hurts. I’m sure it’s painful what he’s gone through and his willingness to play he deserves a chance here.”

 1232,  2012, a, On Fox News Sunday Paul Ryan said that he didn’t have time to explain the math behind his tax proposal. Fortunately I have a few minutes to spare so I thought I’d pitch in.Mr. Ryan and Mitt Romney have proposed a tax plan that would lower everyone’s tax rates by 20 percent. On Sunday Mr. Ryan was asked to explain how the proposal can be revenue neutral — that is not reduce the total amount of tax revenues collected — given this condition of substantially lower tax rates. He mentioned ending tax deductions starting with “people at the higher end” and broadening the tax base and finally declared:… it would take me too long to go through all of the math but let me say it this way. You can lower tax rates by 20 percent across the board by closing loopholes and still have preferences for the middle class for things like charitable deductions for home purchases for health care.There’s a reason why it would take too long — infinitely long you could say — to go through the math that holds this policy proposal together: because math will never hold this particular policy proposal together.You cannot lower tax rates as much as Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan propose to do and keep all the existing tax expenditures for middle class Americans and still end up with the same total amount of tax revenue.As the Tax Policy Center demonstrated cutting individual income tax rates by 20 percent from today’s levels would reduce tax burdens by $251 billion per year (in 2015) among households with income above $200000.If you leave preferential tax rates for savings and investing (e.g. long-term capital gains and dividends) untouched as Mr. Romney has said he would do that leaves only $165 billion of available tax expenditures that can be eliminated from this same group of high-income earners once their marginal tax rates fall.That means there’s an $86 billion shortfall — the difference between $251 billion in tax cuts and $165 billion in potential tax increases on this high-income group — that needs to be accounted for somewhere.By process of elimination that somewhere must be the rest of the population the 95 percent of households earning less than about $200000 annually.The taxes for this group which Mr. Romney has called “middle income” would have to go up. The only ways to get the taxes collected from this group to go up would be to raise their rates (which Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have already ruled out) and/or eliminate the major tax preferences they enjoy.It’s arithmetically possible to achieve some subset of the main principles that the Romney-Ryan tax plan aims for: cutting current marginal income tax rates by 20 percent; preserving/enhancing incentives for saving and investment; eliminating the alternative minimum tax; eliminating the estate tax; maintaining revenue neutrality; and not raising the tax burden on the middle class.But not all of those principles can coexist so long as basic arithmetic survives.

 5615,  1986, a, Eastern Air Lines Inc. reeling from an industrywide fare war reported yesterday a second-quarter loss of $44 million compared with a profit of $25.5 million or 37 cents a share for the corresponding period a year ago.Eastern's revenues declined 15.4 percent to $1.1 billion from $1.3 billion.Wall Street had been expecting bad news from Eastern whose chairman Frank Borman resigned on June 30.Joseph B. Leonard Eastern's president attributed its poor performance to the combination of industry fare discounting and remaining fallout from union threats against the company earlier in the year. Meanwhile the Texas AirCorporation which had agreed to buy Eastern in a $676 million deal that is pending before the Transportation Department reported that it had a second-quarter loss of $44.8 million compared with net income of $41 million or $2.69 a share a year ago.

Cable and Wireless a global telecommunications company that had about $11.5 billion in revenue last year said May 14 that it would buy Digital Island of San Francisco for $340 million plus the assumption of about $50 million of debt. The companies said the merger would not require a review by the Office of Fair Trading in Britain or by the European Commission. But the companies have agreed to submit it to the United States Committee of Foreign Investment which considers national security issues when foreign companies buy American ones.

 5125,  1989, a, The Who's 25th anniversary tour which came to Giants Stadium on Thursday might be called ''the Who cash in'' as the reunited band reprises its songs for a summer's work projected to bring in about $30 million. Thursday's concert was mammoth in every way - in attendance (54000 for the first of four nights) in the size of the band (15 members) and in length (more than three hours of music).The crowd would probably have been pleased with a run-through of greatest hits. But in an unpredictable program that included hits a sizable part of the rock opera ''Tommy'' and a selection of cover versions and material from band members' solo albums the Who was both generous and almost vulnerable. The band revealed itself not just as earth-shaking stadium-rockers - though there are few experiences in rock to compare with hearing ''Won't Get Fooled Again'' as tens of thousands of arms wave and voices sing along - but as eccentric even playful rock elder statesmen jumping around the stage.The original Who members - the singer Roger Daltrey the guitarist-songwriter Pete Townshend and the bassist John Entwistle - played ''Magic Bus'' and ''Mary-Anne With the Shaky Hands'' on their own. Otherwise the sound was filled out by Simon Phillips on drums (replacing the late Keith Moon) and auxiliary guitar keyboards percussion horns and singers not all of whom were strictly necessary.The band members' solo features implied perhaps misleadingly each one's contributions to the Who - Mr. Entwistle's brute-force rock Mr. Townshend's earnest pop and Mr. Daltrey's fondness for the blues. But choices outside the Who's catalogue were often embarrassing; instead of others' material the Who might have revived songs that aren't on its greatest-hits albums. For its encore the Who proudly declared itself a 1960's band with ''Barefootin''' ''Hey Joe'' and the Beatles' arrangement of ''Twist and Shout.''

 4106,  1995, a, He crouched right foot forward bent slightly at the waist his hands in front of him keeping index and middle fingers on the flippers. "I'm the only one I know who uses two fingers."IT seems to work for him. For more than an hour he kept the steel balls in play doing what he wanted. Like the other better players he knows the wiring of this and most other games practically all of which are manufactured in Chicago. He knows what sequences will bring him the highest score. At times he flipped the balls from one flipper to another. He also called his shots softly saying which ramp or hole or bumper he was going to hit and then he did it."Watch this I'm about to get into what this game calls the zone which means that six balls are going to come out at one time" he said and sure enough lights started flashing as six balls began ricocheting down the sloping panel.Later when one ball fell between the flippers he shook his head and declared "That was a less than average ball." As if to motivate himself he said: "Remember pinball is a one-ball game. One ball is all you need to get billions."He got his billions but he did not match the 2.4 billion he had scored on the machine some time ago to become the machine's Grand Master with his name flashing on it every few minutes.In fact he had also been the Grand Master on the Shadow another model at the arcade but last week a player named Domenick whom he knew had beaten his previous high and replaced him. Apparantly Gentleman Kai was not happy about this though he did not talk of revenge.Still with the crowd of spectators following him he moved to the Shadow and dropped 50 cents to start it up. He said nothing but you could see his intensity and desire. He flipped brilliantly with a great economy of movement. No showboating. No body English. Like DiMaggio. Like Manolete. When he passed four billion the machine's voice announced that he was again its highest-scoring player. It invited him to write his name in place of Domenick.Though he did not exult you could see he felt good. He was focused concentrating on the games ahead this wekeend when he would be going up against all those people coming to his turf from all the major malls in the world. He was ready.

 8,  2019, a, There are however a couple things you’ll need to discuss during the meeting. First agree on a story about why you left. “Sometimes you can negotiate with your employer and they will agree to say you weren’t fired” said Ms. Green. In some cases they may agree to just confirm your dates of employment when called for a reference. “The time to do that is in the meeting when the firing is happening because they have an incentive to wrap this up as pleasantly as possible.” You might even be able to negotiate for more severance.Finally try to turn that meeting into a learning opportunity. “If you’re not too devastated by having gotten fired this is a great opportunity for you to get the feedback that you didn’t get earlier” Ms. Scott said. Ask what you can do better so you don’t find yourself in the same situation next time. “Then I would ask my boss ‘Where do you see me working? What kind of opportunity do you think I would thrive in?’ If the boss is a total jerk you’re probably not going to get any useful information but usually people have an idea of where you would really do well.”Hit the ground running at your next jobDon’t wait until you’ve been fired to start searching for your next job. “As soon as you start being worried start the job search” Ms. Green said. “Reconnect with your network and start looking around at what’s out there.” Make a list of everyone you know who might be able to offer you work — or might know someone who could. If you’re in a field where freelancing is common see if you can line up some potential freelance work during the gap. “The sooner that you can start the better” said Ms. Green. “You don’t want to go home from that meeting and be at square one.”Hopefully that will help you line up interviews quickly. Just make sure you’re prepared to answer the question of why you left your last job. You don’t have to say “I was fired” necessarily but don’t lie outright since the interviewer will likely talk to your former boss. Instead come up with a brief nondefensive explanation of why it didn’t work out. Ms. Scott offered a simple script: “You could say something like ‘I realized that I’m really not well-suited for XYZ kind of opportunities. But that’s why this job is really appealing to me because I’ll be playing to my strengths.’” If you can show that you’re a person who takes feedback and learns from your experiences good employers will take notice.Finally remember that no amount of preparation can inoculate you against the blow to your ego. Give yourself a few days to recover but try to shift your focus to the future. “The road to insanity in these situations is obsessing about injustice” said Ms. Scott. “Sometimes there really is injustice and you may want to take action. But usually it’s a better return on investment of your time to get a new great job.” After all the best revenge is a life well lived.
 1745,  2009, a, Paul NatkinThough you’ll never see Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley reunite on this plane of existence a Broadway show that brings them together may be the next best thing. On Tuesday the producers of the musical “Million Dollar Quartet” said that they planned to bring their show based on a 1956 recording session that brought that famous foursome together at Sun Records in Memphis to Broadway in the spring.In a news release publicists for the musical which is presently playing at the Apollo Theater in Chicago said that the Broadway production would be directed by Eric Schaeffer. Its score is comprised of vintage rock songs made famous by those singers including “Blue Suede Shoes” “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Whole Lotta’ Shakin’ Goin’ On” and its book is by Colin Escott and Floyd Mutrux. The Chicago production features Brian McCaskill (as Sam Phillips) Rob Lyons (as Carl Perkins) Lance Guest (as Johnny Cash) Levi Kreis (as Jerry Lee Lewis) and Eddie Clendening (as Elvis Presley). No casting or theater was announced for the Broadway production which is produced by Relevant Theatricals John Cossette Productions Northern Lights Inc. Broadway Across America and James L.

 4029,  1996, a, The race covered 137.85 miles or 17 circuits of an 8.11-mile course through the upscale Buckhead section north of downtown. With the cloud cover and the 73-degree temperature making the 84 percent humidity almost tolerable this was the fastest road race in Olympic history. The first two finishers were timed in 4 hours 53 minutes 56 seconds an average speed of 28.1 miles an hour.For a year Armstrong had been saying that he would rather win the Olympic gold medal than the Tour de France. But bronchitis and a slight strep infection less than a month ago forced him out of the Tour de France and hurt his conditioning and today he was a victim of the erratic tactics of the pack.''Am I disappointed?'' he said. ''Yes and no. I have to be realistic. It's a long year and this is just a one-day race. People who expect wins every time don't know cycling.''With typical bravado Armstrong bolted to the front with 40 miles to go. ''I always feel like I need to give it a try'' he said. ''That's what it's all about taking risks. Some work and some do not.''This one did not because Richard and Sorensen soon joined him. Although the three took turns in the lead to conserve strength they never got more than 15 seconds ahead. The pack soon caught up. With 24 1/2 miles to go Armstrong attacked again. He even saved a fraction of a second by cutting through a service station. But the big guns closed in and with 19 miles to go he was caught.
 4149,  1995, a, One day last week a visitor to the Metropolitan Museum found herself smiling back at a man who was gazing impishly even flirtatiously at her. He had curly hair big eyes and was wearing what appeared to be a turtleneck sweater. His last name was Lesueur. His first she does not know nor ever will. He died in 1876.Lesueur an actor was one of the many famous friends and acquaintances photographed mostly in the mid-19th century by a caricaturist and journalist who called himself Nadar and is now the subject of a major museum show. Nadar a tall burly man with hair that flies back from his face and a thick mustache looks in his self-portrait like a handful. His wife her eyes and lips narrowed and her body backing away from his camera certainly seems to have thought so.In truth Nadar may or may not have thrown off heat and his wife may or may not have frosted the air around her. Such speculation is based only on a long luxurious scrutiny of their images -- luxurious because one cannot afford to stare too long at actuality. Actuality -- living breathing people -- gets angry ("Why are you looking at me that way?") or defensive ("I didn't sleep last night") or snippy ("So rude!"). Images remain serene.Some photographs say more about their makers than they do of their subjects. And a photograph in a fashion magazine however attractive the model is meant to talk about what she or he is wearing. But the subject of a photograph by the Nadars of this world speaks to the viewer. Sometimes the viewer like the woman who smiled at Lesueur speaks back.

Are the victims of hate crimes and those who commit them restricted to a particular group of people? Give examples to support your answer.f. Do you agree with the statement “The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder of James Byrd in Jasper Tex. is understandable”? What reason does the author give for this attitude?g. Why do you think “some sense of warped superiority or inadequacy or fear” might lead someone to commit a hate crime?h. Based on the final paragraph of the article what is the author’s opinion about what needs to be done in order to stop hate crimes?3. In round-table discussion format consider these questions:–What are the causes of hate crimes?–What can we as a society and as individuals do to reduce hate crimes?To keep the discussion flowing in an orderly manner and to decrease any personal attacks that may occur over such a heated issue the teacher may want to keep a “stack” of the names of students who wish to contribute to the discussion. Students who wish to speak can have their names added to the list by raising their hands and names are added to the bottom of the list to maintain the order in which students volunteer to speak. Establish ground rules that prohibit personal attacks raised voices and disrespectful language in order to encourage a free-flowing candid discussion.4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students write a personal essay expressing their personal views about hate crimes. The essay should include an action plan that describes how individuals and social institutions (including schools churches and local state and national governments) can acknowledge and address the causes of hate crimes.Further Questions for Discussion:–What is a hate crime? How is a hate crime different from other crimes?–What is the relationship between hate crimes and attitudes of prejudice and intolerance?–Where do individuals learn attitudes of prejudice intolerance and hatred?–What are the definitions of racism anti-Semitism and homophobia?–Are there examples of hate crimes that have been committed in our community? If so who was/were the victim(s) and who committed the crime(s). In each case why would you describe this as a hate crime? How did the community respond to each crime?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal response participation in class discussions and written personal essay and action plan.Vocabulary:supremacist aberration inhumane repelled sanction presupposes prejudice intolerance litany taunted abducted biracial gleeful frequency viciousness proliferation racism anti-Semitism homophobia grotesque wallowing hideousness impulses mayhem warped superiority inadequacy maiming despisedExtension Activities:1. Research laws that deal with hate crimes on the local state and federal levels. For each law investigate specific examples of how that law has been enacted in the United States.2. Organize a debate on this topic: Hate groups should not enjoy the right of free speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment as individuals and groups that promote less controversial beliefs.3. Find news articles about the murder of James Byrd Jr. and the trial and conviction of John William King and compare them to this op-ed article. How do these different types of newspaper writing present ideas differently?4. Learn about the history and work of the Southern Poverty Law Center and present your findings to the class. (Address: Southern Poverty Law Center 400 Washington Avenue Montgomery AL 36104; online at (//www.splcenter.org/)5. Read a novel or other book on the subject of racial religious or other type of prejudice or hatred and discuss it with the class. (Suggestions: To Kill a Mockingbird Black Boy The Summer of My German Soldier The Diary of Anne Frank.)6. Write a children’s book that contains a lesson about tolerance.7. Write slogans and create posters to encourage tolerance and understanding and discourage prejudice and hatred.8. Note: This activity is suitable for older students and will require careful monitoring by the teacher. Review the literature and/or Web sites of hate groups and analyze their messages and tactics. Write a letter to one of these groups expressing your opinion about their beliefs.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research historic examples of Supreme Court cases dealing with discrimination based on race religion gender or sexual preference.Global History- Investigate legislation in other countries that addresses the issue of discrimination.Teaching with The Times- Find articles in various sections of The New York Times that deal with the murder of James Byrd Jr. other cases described in the featured article or other examples of hate crimes and the activities of hate groups.

 3198,  2001, a, The three biggest television networks -- ABC CBS and NBC -- filed a copyright infringement lawsuit yesterday against the maker of a digital device that functions much like a videocassette recorder. The complaint was filed in the Federal District Court for Central California against ReplayTV Inc. and its corporate parent Sonicblue Inc. ReplayTV makes a device much like the better-known TiVo unit that records television programs on a big hard disk. ReplayTV however recently introduced a new version of its machine that allows users to set it to skip advertisements and to transmit recorded programs to other people over the Internet. An intriguing aspect of the lawsuit is that NBC which is a unit of the General Electric Company is an investor in ReplayTV as is the Walt Disney Company which also owns ABC. CBS is owned by Viacom Inc. Seth Schiesel (NYT)

 5161,  1989, a, CLASSICAL Copland: 'Appalachian Spring' Suite 'Short Symphony' and Other Works Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 335; CD and cassette. Copland originally wrote ''Appalachian Spring'' for 13 instruments all that could fit in the pit for the 1944 premiere of the Martha Graham ballet - a version he suppressed once the suite for full orchestra caught on. With his concise and rhythmically exciting ''Short Symphony'' (1933) he did something of the reverse; since it proved too difficult for many orchestras he made a sextet setting which we are likelier to encounter. Here are variants on both originals - the ''Spring'' Suite in a chamber orchestration (the 13 instruments plus extra strings) the symphony in a chamber orchestra reduction devised by Dennis Russell Davies - along with chamber orchestra renditions of ''Quiet City'' and ''Three Latin American Sketches.'' Orpheus plays with verve if not an especially original point of view. In DG's recording close and striking the ''Short Symphony'' is a real grabber. - Mark Swed Richard Strauss: 'Aus Italien' Four Orchestral Songs Felicity Lott soprano (Songs); Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi. Chandos 8744; all three formats. Like Mendelssohn and Berlioz before and Elgar after him Richard Strauss knew how to capture his glowing youthful Italian impressions in music. The designation ''Symphonic Fantasy'' fits the early ''Aus Italien'' (1886) well. Those who tend to dismiss it as a ''travelogue'' because of its symphonic elaboration of the familiar ''Funiculi Funicula'' in the final movement are bound to overlook the subtleties and splendid colors of the preceding three - particularly the third movement (''On the Shores of Sorrento'') which points ahead to later Strauss. The performance apparently the first on CD is vigorously led by Neeme Jarvi and save for a tremulous oboe solo well played. The songs - ''Winterweihe'' ''Mein Auge'' ''Der Rosenband'' and ''Befreit'' rapturous utterances in radiant orchestral settings - are faultlessly sung by Felicity Lott. - George Jellinek 'New Music Series' Vol. 1: Works by Korde Lippe Mabry Risset Rubin Scelsi and Xenakis Robert Black double bass; Walter van Hawe alto recorder; Mel Cuthbertson tuba; Holy Cross Chamber Players conducted by Toshimasa Francis Wada. Neuma CD 450-71; CD only. Neuma a label based in Acton Mass. offers seven recent works in a sampler reminiscent of the new-music collections the major labels offered in the 1960's; indeed a 60's avant-garde esthetic pervades the disk. Most enjoyable are two electronic pieces. Jean-Claude Risset's ''Contours'' a tactile and sometimes spacily atmospheric work is a study in thematic transformation; and Anna Rubin's ''Crying the Laughing and Golden'' uses the sound of laughter and whispering to create an evocative intensely emotional soundscape. Interesting too are the glittering variegated ''Chamber Piece'' by Shirish Korde and Drake Mabry's ''12.5.83'' a fleet virtuosic essay for alto recorder. - Allan Kozinn Mendelssohn: Concertos in D minor: for Violin and Strings; for Violin Piano and Strings Gidon Kremer violin; Martha Argerich piano; Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 338; CD and cassette. It's in just this sort of peripheral repertory which requires first-rate performances to make it at all effective that we've too often had to settle for well-meant mediocrity. Nothing of the sort here as two supreme virtuosos admirably supported by the conductorless Orpheus ensemble throw their formidable artistic weight into impetuous committed and compelling performances of two seldom-heard works Mendelssohn composed at ages 13 and 14. Even given such high-powered treatment the Violin Concerto of 1822 cannot rival its famous E minor counterpart of 1844 in formal concision or lyrical refinement but both youthful works emerge here as strong vibrant creations fully worthy of broader exposure in such top-flight performances. - James R. Oestreich Davis: 'The Silents: Musical Scores for Classic Silent Films' London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Carl Davis. Virgin Classics 7 90785; CD and cassette. This music is the sort that makes the snobs shout ''derivative.'' Let them shout. They'll take nothing away from Carl Davis's gifts as a composer of memorable Hollywood music in the grand old tradition - eclectic but always expressive of the dramatic situation and handled with consummate flair. Sometimes Mr. Davis adapts existing music - Gottschalk tunes and traditional Chinese melodies for ''Broken Blossoms'' hunks of ''Scheherazade'' for ''The Thief of Baghdad.'' But such original material as ''The Eagle of Destiny'' for ''Napoleon'' the Garbo theme for ''Flesh and the Devil'' and the nightmarish Prokofievian cyclone music in ''The Wind'' stand securely on their own. The London Philharmonic plays well and Virgin offers good sound. - Barrymore L. Scherer POP/JAZZ Jefferson Airplane: 'Jefferson Airplane' Epic 45271; all three formats. Reunited after 17 years the Jefferson Airplane still sounds like a collection of quarrelsome bohemians with eccentric interests. ''Summer of Love'' Marty Balin's eulogy to the hippie dream is the likeliest hit. Paul Kantner's ''Planes'' exalts the Freudian implications of air travel. Grace Slick's ''Panda'' pleads for the salvation of the species from extinction and her ''Common Market Madrigal'' compares erotic love with European tourism. The portentous political anthem ''Solidarity'' lists Bertolt Brecht as one of its collaborators and the mystical ''Wheel'' proclaims ''From the heart of the volcano the future is born.'' With all its windy blather and quirkiness the album sounds too fresh to seem a cynical cashing-in on nostalgia. - Stephen Holden Archie Brownlee and the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi: 'You Done What the Doctor Couldn't Do' Gospel Jubilee RF-1402 (Down Home Records 10341 San Pablo Ave. El Cerrito Calif. 94530); LP only. The best tracks on this anthology taken from 1948 through 1959 achieve the forward motion of a hurtling train the deep intensity of the best art. Archie Brownlee one of hard gospel's most influential singers had a voice that could balloon at the end of a phrase turn from velvet to crushed rock on a syllable. The group which began at the Piney Woods School for blind children in Mississippi cushions Mr. Brownlee's expeditions into passion with purring organlike chords occasionally backed by guitar and drums. But it's Mr. Brownlee's voice gashing through the accompaniment signifying a man caught up in the passion of belief that makes these numbers work. - Peter Watrous 'Siya Hamba: 1950's South African Country and Small Town Sounds' Original Music OMA 111 (R. D. 1 Box 190 Lasher Road Tivoli N. Y. 12583); LP only. While recent commercial recordings from South Africa have lately been reaching the United States ''Siya Hamba'' is a find - a glimpse into the urban and rural music of the 1950's. The urban music on side two shows how South Africans assimilated big-band pop and jump-blues; the music uses suave jazzy harmony choruses behind powerful lead singers whose melodies still have traditional shapes. But the rural music on side one recorded in the countryside is the revelation. Using imported instruments like harmonica concertina autoharp or guitar in place of previous generations' traditional instruments the music is raw rhythmic and utterly joyous with shouting laughing audiences to prove it. - Jon Pareles Rhonda Clark: 'Between Friends' Tabu; all three formats. Ms. Clark has a pinched tight voice that can get nasty painted with touches of Dinah Washington or Esther Phillips's nasal tone. This is good as her sound introduces a touch of reality into tunes heavy with ethereal synthesizer colors and distant thumping bass lines. Recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios in Minneapolis and partially produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (the movers behind Janet Jackson among others) Ms. Clark's debut album has the producer's special sound clean full of puffs of music and overdubbed voices. When she improvises screaming through the breaks in the production on ''The Way You Are'' it's obvious she's something special. - P. W.
 399,  2016, a, PhotoTUESDAY PUZZLE — Look! Up in the SKY! It’s a FLOCK OF BIRDS! It’s a PLANE! It’s Paul MOLITOR whom I did not know before today’s puzzle by Peter A. Collins. But apparently Mr. MOLITOR can fly because he’s up there above the HORIZON.Today we have a crossword with a visual element which is the HORIZON stretching across the middle of our grid and the “blue expanse” SKY and the “blue expanse” SEA above and below. Some of the contents of the SKY and the SEA can be seen in their appropriate places in the grid. (We won’t talk about the placement of Amelia EARHART at 41 Down. Mr. Collins explains that in his notes below.)Two theme entries that are relatively common phrases — FLOCK OF BIRDS and SCHOOL OF FISH — make their New York Times debuts today a fact that surprised me. Wouldn’t you think they would have appeared at least once in this crossword? When I first solved the puzzle I felt like I had seen this theme before but Mr. Collins’s take on it seems to be unique.Mr. Collins talks about the nontheme fill in his notes below and I agree with him that there seems to have been quite a few three-letter words in addition to less desirable fill and abbreviation. Still I appreciated the CHEX Mix offering and the fact that it was above the HORIZON because who likes soggy snacks?Let’s hear from our constructor:Constructor’s Notes:Into which category does the theme of this one fall? There is no wordplay in the usual crossword sense – it’s the location of the themed entries that gives them relevance. Is there a name for this kind of puzzle? The theme has quite a lot of three-letter answers (25) which was necessitated to a large extent by HORIZON and its neighboring black squares in the center of the grid (forming a visual “horizon” I hope). Will and Joel asked me to rework the grid to try to lower the three-letter word count which I did. However in the end they thought the fill in this original version was significantly superior — enough to counterbalance the short-answer overload. When first constructing the puzzle I tried to include additional themed material — CLOUD and SHARK in the top and bottom rows where BRAWL and RATTY are — but that’s when the fill really started to groan. I’m happy to introduce NO CUTS today. I don’t know about you but the phrase always immediately transports me back to waiting in the lunch line at my junior high. Ahh I can practically feel the wedgies and the noogies … And honestly I didn’t intend for poor Amelia EARHART to end up nose-down in the SEA. In fact it didn’t dawn on me until well after I’d finished constructing the puzzle. Yikes! But I decided to leave her there. What? Too soon? At least she took a HIPSTER down with her.One of the things I love about the Internet — there’s a lot to feel ambivalent about — is the fact that we can experience things outside our own backyards and before our time. Let’s move on to our Wednesday puzzle with some Edith Piaf in a live performance from 1954:Your thoughts?

 7392,  1964, a, LONDON Dec. 31 (AP) —A hand‐painted decanter of sloe gin nearly 150 years old has been sent to Premier Khrushchev as a New Year's gift from England. Capt. Michael Farr the Plymouth wine merchant who sent it said: “I wanted to make sure that Mr. K. has a drop of genuine Olde Englishe instead of vodka or foreign wines for his New Year toast.”
 3622,  1998, a, A proposal to toughen drunken driving laws around the country was dealt a serious blow tonight after a House panel voted to squelch the measure by keeping it from a vote on the floor.The decision by a voice vote of the Rules Committee was a hard-fought lobbying victory for beer distributors and restaurant chains. They had argued that the proposal which would have forced states to adopt a stricter definition of drunken driving or risk losing Federal highway funds would have cut into their sales of alcoholic beverages. The proposal already approved in the Senate would have lowered the legal limit for intoxication to a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent as opposed to most states' standard of 0.10 percent.The panel's decision tonight left millions of members of the group Mothers Against Drunk Driving which has lobbied for the measure on Capitol Hill and in state legislatures for 14 years wondering where they should turn next.By keeping the proposal off the floor Republicans sought to fend off an emotional debate on drunken driving and block a vote on an amendment that members may have found difficult to oppose. The Senate had approved an identical amendment to its highway bill on March 4 by a 62-to-32 vote a margin typically large enough to encourage the House to act. But with the House panel's rejection of the amendment its chances of survival through conference between the two houses appears dim.

 4240,  1995, a, "But he told me that I wasn't next to be traded" Franco said yesterday afternoon "and that he wanted me around. I told him I hoped to pitch four or five more years and then go into coaching or managing. He said this would be a good opportunity to show my leadership skills and that he looked to me to provide veteran leadership to the younger players."Franco took this seriously and counseled Jason Isringhausen for one who seemed slightly shaken by a loss to Colorado."It's not your first bad game" Franco told him "and it won't be your last." And to Isringhausen and the other young Mets pitchers he pointed out how baseball's best pitching staff that of the Atlanta Braves "took their lumps when they were younger. Glavine Smoltz Avery they all had it tough. But they're making $4 million and $5 million now." It may seem like obvious advice but having it come from a veteran could make a difference in a young player's psyche.And Franco talked to some of the younger pitchers about why the Braves have such a terrific pitching staff. "For one thing" he said "they are very good on fundamentals from fielding to bunting so they help themselves in a game. But they also work hard to stay in shape and doing all the running and throwing between pitching assignments to keep them sharp."Franco recalled this amid the uproar of bowling pins being attacked by major league ballplayers at the Bobby Bonilla/Budweiser All-Star Bowling Classic at the Leisure Time Bowling Center at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The purpose was to raise money for the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund. Besides Franco the other bowling ballplayers included Cecil Fielder Ken Griffey Jr. David Justice Kenny Lofton Eddie Murray Rafael Palmeiro Mike Piazza Kirby Puckett Ozzie Smith and Frank Thomas.

 4487,  1993, a, A Government-controlled newspaper said today that the governor of China's central bank had been dismissed and a well-connected Chinese said the announcement was being circulated among senior officials in Beijing.Li Guixian the governor of the People's Bank of China is being replaced as part of a revamping of the financial sector according to Wen Wei Po a Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong. Several Chinese familiar with the case said that they too had learned of Mr. Li's removal but that it was unclear what the move meant for China's economic policies.Mr. Li a 55-year-old career Communist cadre who has headed the central bank since 1988 was apparently removed for two reasons. First he was blamed for allowing a $175 million financial scandal in which more than 100000 bondholders lost much of their capital. Move Toward Curbing GrowthAnd Mr. Li was regarded as being ineffective in curbing monetary growth at a time when the Chinese economy was overheating. His abrupt departure is likely to be seen as a sign that Beijing has decided it wants to curb the money supply limit the rampant speculation in real estate and reduce credit without creating cash shortages in the countryside.

 6134,  1977, a, Others are looking in the meantime for alternative means to brighten the picture. But except for one outstanding exception the plans seem to rest on gambles as chancy as the casino campaign.The exception is the restoration of the beaches.In the glory days of Miami Beach which dwindled and then ended abruptly owing to a combination of events topped by the energy crisis of 1973‐74 the men who operated the seaside resorts along Hotel Row on Collins Avenue ran their empires with a keen sense of service business and cirofitmaking.They blocked measures to restore the narrow sandy beach that was eroded by natural ocean currents and the intrusion of concrete bulkheads and canopied hotel cabanas because they did not want the public to share widened beach with guests who were paying up to $100 a day.Other Projects illusoryWith economic reversals however the way was opened for the Federal Government to pump money and sand into Miami Beach: a $60 million dredging operation to restore 10 miles of oceanfront.Other projects are more illusory than real at the moment. Local business leaders are seeking $100 million in loan guarantees from Federal agencies to refurbish the resort hotels. They contend that such an investment would benefit the entire area.However Paul Dempsey an official with the Economic Development Administration in Washington said in telephone interview that the Miami Beach proposal had significant “defects” and would require extensive rewriting before it could be given serious consideration..“Our talks at this moment are very preliminary and only exploratory” said Mt. Dempsey. “A lot of the problem is obvious: Some of the hotels have been skimming off profits and the deterioration has been allowed to happen.”

 324,  2017, a, For William 20 a junior from Birmingham Ala. her awakening during this tournament has been a validation of her skill and a rebuke to the countless people who told her she was too short to play major college basketball. After averaging 9.6 points for her career William scored 41 in a regional final a week ago against Baylor. And then she dribbled three times to the right of the lane just before overtime expired on Friday and hit a 15-foot jumper sending Mississippi State’s players and fans into delirium.In that moment William did what every child who ever played basketball in the driveway or shot at a hoop nailed to a barn has dreamed of and rehearsed — counting the time down hitting the winning shot and hearing the crowd erupt with the sound of something decisive and astounding.“Sometimes all it takes is one kid to go into a completely different zone and they can carry a team through an entire tournament” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “It happens. That kid averaged 9 points a game during the season. This isn’t the regular season. She doesn’t have to do it for the next five months.” Just for one more night.“That’s a whole different dynamic” he said.Auriemma met William at a Final Four banquet on Wednesday night and said he told her: “That’s what the N.C.A.A. tournament’s all about for kids to throw themselves into the national spotlight. It’s the chance of a lifetime and you’re taking advantage of it.”But her career has not followed the same smooth arc as her winning shot on Friday.When William was a senior in high school in Birmingham in 2014 her stepfather Donnie Rory died of a heart attack. He had played football at Samford University in Alabama and had encouraged his stepdaughter to play basketball. She could play in the S.E.C. he told her and could be the best point guard in the conference. “Every time I play basketball I think about him” William said. “He put the ball in my hand when I was 3 and I ran from there.”At Mississippi State she found the understanding of Schaefer who had lost both his parents. William rooms with Schaefer’s daughter Blair a reserve guard on the team and often eats dinner at the Schaefer household.
 1161,  2012, a, Errol Morris on photography.This is the second in a three-part series.And he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark on their right hand or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell save that he had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name.— Revelation XIII: 1617.2.THE NUMBER OF HIS NAME“Have you ever seen Herman Melville’s passport?” This was a question from Judy Rascoe a screenwriter and a well-read friend. I had to admit that I had not. I had not even thought about the question of whether Melville needed a passport. It had just never entered my head.Several e-mails later Judy directed me to a Web site that provides 19th-century passports and passport applications. Included is a facsimile of Herman Melville’s passport application dated Oct. 1 1849. There is no photograph accompanying the application (even though daguerreotypes and tintypes had been around for nearly a decade). I was puzzled. How can a customs official or a border control agent know that the person standing before him is really Herman Melville and not someone else? Or am I missing the point? Perhaps the passport isn’t used for identification. Perhaps it is only a formality. More like a letter of introduction. But if proof of identity is of no importance then why include personal details at all?Melville writes in his application “Included are the items of personal description which I trust will prove sufficient.”Height – 5 ft. 10 1/8 [1]Eyes – BlueHair – Dark BrownMouth – MediumNose – Medium ProminentComplexion – FairAge – 30 yearsForehead – MediumChin – OrdinaryFace – OvalNational Archives and Records AdministrationWere these self-reported measurements deemed sufficient? Today they would be rejected out of hand.[2] Face — Oval? Chin — Ordinary? What does that tell us?How were people able to “prove” their identity to others before the advent of photography and fingerprinting? Melville’s passport raises all kinds of questions. Did people accept his “identity” on trust? Were customs officials simply making do with written descriptions because nothing better was available?There are problems with self-reporting. Are we the best judges of our own physical characteristics? If someone wanted to dissemble or hide from others his true identity couldn’t he provide self-serving and misleading information? How do we make the measure of man more objective? How can it be standardized? And how can we be assured that we are providing a unique identification?After all even if Melville had recorded his height correctly he was not the only man with an ordinary chin oval-shaped face and blue eyes. He is the only man who wrote “Benito Cereno.” But it’s not clear how that detail would serve at a border crossing.Alphonse Bertillon who worked as a records clerk in a Parisian police department had these issues in mind when he started assembling physical data about criminals. The Bertillon system or bertillonage as it became known (or anthropometry or signaletics) consisted of a series of measurements that would uniquely identify an individual. Unlike Melville’s passport application self-reporting was eliminated. Instead a series of elaborate measurements were taken with specialized equipment used under standardized conditions. [3] Initially it was believed that these measurements alone would be sufficient but photographs were later added — a frontal portrait and profile. Surely in conjunction with a photograph these measurements would be even more reliable.Library of Congress (Prints and Photographs Division) Bain CollectionLibrary of Congress (Prints and Photographs Division) Bain CollectionLibrary of Congress (Prints and Photographs Division) Bain CollectionLibrary of Congress (Prints and Photographs Division) Bain CollectionThe Bertillon system was introduced in 1882. Fingerprinting had been around in one form or another before but by World War I they were competing systems. Part of the difficulty of deciding on the efficacy of one over the other hinged on the retrieval of information. How do you classify fingerprints so that an unknown fingerprint can be efficiently matched with a card in a file? [4] The cataloging of fingerprints at first glance seems to be subjective. Exactly what counts as a match between two prints? The Bertillon system in comparison is straightforward. You have numerical data on a card and you are able to catalog the data in a simple and straightforward manner.New York City Municipal ArchivesAnd when photography became part of the Bertillon system the card presented photographs alongside the “precise” Bertillon measurement of height etc. Francis Galton the father of eugenics and eventually a champion of fingerprinting allowed himself to be memorialized on a Bertillon card with both a frontal photographic portrait and a profile. But the Bertillon measurements were never filled in.UCL/Galton CollectionPhotographs were used by the police as early as the 1840s. [5] [6] By midcentury collections of photographs were assembled by various police departments in what became known as “rogues’ galleries.” [7]“Professional Criminals of America” written by Thomas Byrnes inspector of police and chief of detectives in New York City and published in 1886 is a perfect example of such a rogues’ gallery. It explains why photography is an indispensable aid in the unique identification of criminals. [8] To the trained observer the photograph provides essential details. A criminal can try to disguise his appearance before the camera but the photograph sees through all of that — to telling physical details and facial quirks that cannot be fully concealed. Byrnes compares these features to the mark of Cain. [9]The very cleverest hands at preparing a false physiognomy for the camera have made their grimaces in vain. The sun has been too quick for them and has imprisoned the lines of the profile and the features and caught the expression before it could be disguised. There is not a portrait here but has some marked characteristic by which you can identify the man who sat for it. That is what has to be studied in the Rogues’ Gallery — detail.Thomas Byrnes “Professional Criminals of America.” New York: Cassel & Company Limited 1886 170.Thomas Byrnes “Professional Criminals of America.” New York: Cassel & Company Limited 1886 204.“They have made their grimaces in vain.” A photograph captures something unique about a person. Try as hard as they might criminals cannot hide or disguise their identity. And if photographs alone provide unique identification what about photography and bertillonage? Surely that would be even better.And then as the legend goes on May 1 1903 a young man named Will West was admitted to Fort Leavenworth prison on manslaughter charges. [10] A few days later he was brought into the office of the record clerk to be measured and photographed. The clerk thought that he recognized West though West protested. In the best-known account of this story published in 1918 by the forensics pioneers Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth the following exchange is reported:“You have been here before?” “No sir” answered West; but as the clerk was positive he ran his measuring instruments over him and from the Bertillon measurements thus obtained went to the file and returned with the card the measurements called for properly filled out … and bearing the name “William West.” This card was shown to the prisoner who grinned in amazement and said “That’s my picture but I don’t know where you got it for I know I have never been here before.” The record clerk turned the card over and read the particulars there given including the statements that this man was already a prisoner at the same institution having been committed to a life sentence on September 9 1901 for the crime of murder. That is the card found was that of a different man still within the walls of that very prison yet of the same name the same facial expression and practically the same Bertillon measurements as the newcomer! It then dawned on all present that there were two Will Wests and that here was a case of the most remarkable resemblance of two unrelated persons on record; since neither the photographs or the Bertillon measurements were of any avail in establishing the identity of these two men. The clerk writes that with their hats on it is almost impossible to tell these two men apart. [11]Bertillonage and photography had failed to adequately discriminate between the two Wests. Their names were similar — well more than similar — isn’t “Will” an abbreviation of “William”? Their photographs and Bertillon measurements were identical. (Almost.) And they looked like the same person or at worst like identical twins. It became the stuff of legend. Everything about these two men matched except as the story goes for the ink patterns left on paper when they were fingerprinted. Sure enough despite the similarity of appearance of names and of their Bertillon measurements the fingerprints of Will West and William West were completely different: an Inside Whorl of 11 ridges (Will) vs. an Invaded Loop with 18 ridges (William).Graphic by Steven Hathaway / Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead.” Boston: Gorham 1918 33.Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead.” Boston: Gorham 1918 31.Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead.” Boston: Gorham 1918 32.Many subsequent accounts attribute the rise of fingerprinting and the fall of Bertillon measurements to this confusion between one West and the other. But others suggest that the story is fable not fact. [12]I discussed the story of the Wests with Simon Cole an associate professor of criminology at the University of California Irvine. Cole is also the author of “Suspect Identities: A History of Fingerprinting and Criminal Identification” (Harvard University Press 2002) the definitive work on the triumph of fingerprinting (or dactyloscopy) over bertillonage. Cole’s dissent from the etiological myth of “the two Will Wests” debunking bertillonage stems from his observation that the men were in fact distinguishable under the Bertillon system: the 7cm. difference in foot length is outside Bertillon’s maximum tolerable deviation for saying two sets of measurements derived from the same body.SIMON COLE: The story of the two Wests is in all the accounts of the development of fingerprinting including the F.B.I. tour and the F.B.I.’s little pamphlets on the history of identification. It is one of these myths that appear everywhere every encyclopedia article every standard history. And they all tell this same story that I trace back to Wilder and Wentworth.ERROL MORRIS: Yes. But then I read that the two Wests — William and Will — were not influential in making the change from bertillonage to fingerprinting. In fact you make the point.SIMON COLE: Right. It took another 20 years but it has become part of the founding myth of fingerprinting for a reason. Here you have this case study in which these guys looked the same their Bertillon measurements were the same and fingerprints distinguished them.ERROL MORRIS: Yes. It was a sales tool for the promotion of fingerprinting.SIMON COLE: Yes. And then the fact that they turned out to be African-Americans seems not entirely accidental. Wilder himself had perpetuated the idea in his own writings about who should be fingerprinted. It’s all Negroes and Chinese — essentially immigrants and people who aren’t subject to anthropometry. So it is both a founding myth for fingerprinting and its implications for race and that it somehow debunked bertillonage. [13]ERROL MORRIS: So wait a second. It is an origin myth for fingerprinting — how fingerprinting won out over anthropometry but it was created 20 years after the fact?SIMON COLE: I don’t have the smoking gun as to why it was created. But look at Wilder’s own history with this. Wilder starts out very skeptical of fingerprinting and claiming that anthropometry is the real scientific system. Fingerprinting is an expedient if you’re doing something considered to be low-level like identifying Chinese immigrants. But if you’re identifying white criminals in New York you need the better system which is anthropometry. And over the course of 20 years he reverses himself on that position. He becomes converted to fingerprinting.ERROL MORRIS: Why?SIMON COLE: Probably cost reasons. Fingerprinting puts the cost on the back end. It’s cheap to take fingerprints and a little bit more expensive to classify them whereas bertillonage is just the opposite. It’s expensive to take the measurements because you have to train people and keep them disciplined and consistent and working efficiently to take the measurements. And then once you’ve got them the costs go down. Also familiarity. Police agencies became more familiar with it. And as police agencies started using it it seemed to function O.K. The sense of it as less efficient and promising than bertillonage wore off.ERROL MORRIS: But was photography ever considered? Or is this just something that had a kind of brief vogue mid-19th century?SIMON COLE: Yeah. Around 1900-02 when people like Wilder are saying “use anthropometry” and fingerprinting is just coming over from Europe; and the police chief of San Francisco F.H. DePue says “No no use photographs.” There were systems floating around where you would impose a grid over the face and you would somehow quantify the information in the photograph. The reason not to use photographs was “O.K. there’s lots of information there. But how do I classify it? How do I put it in order?” Bertillon talks about: “O.K. you have a pile of photographs. That’s nice. Now what do you do with them?” What order do you put them in so you know how to retrieve the correct photograph when you’re trying to match it to a face?ERROL MORRIS: Right.SIMON COLE: And although I don’t have much sense as to how these things were supposed to work it’s clear that people were thinking about a system of grids over the face. You would come up with some kind of indexing. An indexing system is probably the best thing to call it rather than a classification system. What you want is some way of finding a photograph of a face if that face should appear again. There’s a moment when they’re proposing fingerprinting Chinese immigrants in the 1880s. And they write to the Immigration Bureau in Washington D.C. and they say photography is fine. So there is this moment where photography is seen as a truer and more useful record than a fingerprint. And even as late as 1902 you have DePue saying that as well. But the real problem was the indexing system and it is still the problem with facial recognition systems as an identification tool. There are a lot of advantages to facial recognition because you can do it surreptitiously and people don’t have to cooperate. But the face becomes a difficult thing to classify and convert into quantitative information. You end up just measuring the distances between features and it’s just not the most discriminating kind of measurement compared with irises or fingerprints or DNA.The F.B.I. history of identification (as quoted by Simon Cole) concludes:It would be hard to conceive a more nearly perfect case for refuting the claims of rival systems of identification. Although the two Wests denied being related there was a facial resemblance like that of twin brothers. The formulas derived from their Bertillon measurements were nearly identical — and finally there was the crowning coincidence of the similarity of names. The fallibility of three systems of personal identification — names photographs and Bertillon measurements — were demonstrated by this one case. On the other hand the value of fingerprints as a positive means of identifying people was dramatically shown. [14]The story of the two Wests may not have been the deciding factor in the ascendancy of fingerprints but it showed how fingerprinting could provide a more effective solution to the problem of unique identification. [15]Names photographs and Bertillon measurements. Bertillon measurements are a series of descriptions (or properties) much like the descriptions that accompany Melville’s passport application in 1849. Admittedly they are not self-reported but they seem contingent variable. Isn’t there such a thing as a swollen foot or a goiter or some other physical malady that changes the circumference of a neck or an instep? And what assurance do we have that we’ve identified only one unique individual — the Will/William West problem? What are we grabbing ahold of with these descriptions?Photographs seem to have similar problems. A photograph may not resemble a person immediately after it’s taken let alone years after the fact even though it is still a photograph of that person. Wilder and Wentworth supply just such an example.Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead.” Boston: Gorham 1918 37.The photograph on the left was taken of Frank Murray in Toronto in November 1908; the photograph on the right was taken of Frank Murray in Old Town Me. in December 1909. Roughly a year apart. The prints of the left middle finger were taken at the same times as the photographs. It is still Frank Murray (the same man) over a year later although his appearance is conspicuously different. [16] Again we are left with several questions: [17]1. If we are in possession of a photograph of a man how do we know that a man appearing before us in the flesh is the man in that photograph? (How do we “attach” a photograph to the person who has been photographed?) [18]2. How do we know the man in the photograph is Frank Murray? (How do we “attach” a name to a person in a photograph?)3. Does a photograph uniquely identify an individual e.g. Frank Murray? And if a photograph doesn’t uniquely identify an individual then what does? Fingerprints?Wilder and Wentworth conclude with a series of arguments against “sight recognition.”The extraordinary resemblance between two individuals; second the great amount of change in appearance of which a single individual is capable; third the known unreliability of eyes memory and judgment under the influence of excitement fear or other mental emotion. … The outcome of the inquiry is plainly and irrefutably this: Sight Recognition is not Identification.Their conclusion: only fingerprinting is reliable. Wilder and Wentworth’s book ends with a quote from BertillonTo fix the human personality to give to each human being a definite individuality durable unchangeable always recognizable and easily demonstrable; such seems the most comprehensible object of the new method. [19]Sir Francis Galton’s classic work on fingerprinting “Finger Prints” first appeared in 1892. “Let no one despise the ridges on account of their smallness for they are in some respects the most important of all anthropological data. We shall see that they form patterns considerable in size and of a curious variety of shape whose boundaries can be firmly outlined and which are little worlds in themselves.”Francis Galton “Finger Prints.” New York: MacMillan and Co. 1892 113.Galton showed that these “little worlds” retain their character through a person’s life. And he clearly shows how even a child’s fingerprints “retain their peculiarities” from two years to 15 years old. As Galton writes “[Fingerprints] have the unique merit of retaining all their peculiarities unchanged throughout life and afford in consequence an incomparably surer criterion of identity than any other bodily feature.”Galton was so enamored of ridges and unique identification that he felt it necessary to offer an emendation to the biblical story of Jezebel wife of Ahab who turns him against the Hebrew god Yahweh and toward the worship of the false Phoenician god Baal. “We read of the dead body of Jezebel being devoured by the dogs [in] Jezreel so that no man might say ‘This is Jezebel’ and that the dogs left only her skull the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet; but the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet are the very remains by which a corpse might be surely identified if impressions of them made during life were available.” Francis Galton “Finger Prints” 113. In the biblical account God wants to insure that “no man” can identify Jezebel although he may be possibly misinformed about the utility of palm prints and sole impressions in post-mortem identifications. Gustave Doré illustrated the scene.Gustave Doré via Wikimedia CommonsMark Twain was clearly aware of Galton’s landmark work and in “Pudd’nhead Wilson” — which appeared just a couple of years later in 1894 — he used these “little worlds in themselves” to create a story about race appearance and identity with issues of nature and nurture liberally thrown in. [20]Twain’s story starts with two babies who look more or less alike although they are unrelated. However Tom (Thomas á Beckett Driscoll) is the son of a wealthy white businessman; Chambers (Valet de Chambre) the son of a slave although he is only one-thirty-second black.To all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody but the one-sixteenth of her that was black outvoted the other 15 parts and made her a Negro. She was a slave and salable as such. Her child was 31 parts white and he too was a slave and by a fiction of law and custom a Negro. He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white comrade and even the father of the white child was unable to tell the children apart. [21]Roxy worries that her son will be sold down the river — a fate worse than death — and so she seizes on a plan to switch the two babies. Chambers will become Tom and Tom will become Chambers — or at least their names if not their identities will be switched. The lawyer and the village eccentric — Pudd’nhead Wilson himself — has the habit of “collecting” fingerprints and has taken the fingerprints of Chambers and Tom before and after the switch. Still everyone remains blissfully ignorant of Roxy’s plan until the murder of Tom’s uncle. Here is Pudd’nhead’s presentation one of the great fictional perorations to a jury. [22]“Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave certain physical marks which do not change their character and by which he can always be identified — and that without shade of doubt or question. These marks are his signature his physiological autograph so to speak and this autograph cannot be counterfeited nor can he disguise it or hide it away nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of time. This signature is not his face — age can change that beyond recognition; it is not his hair for that can fall out; it is not his height for duplicates of that exist; it is not his form for duplicates of that exist also whereas this signature is each man’s very own — there is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe! […] “This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with which Nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet. If you will look at the balls of your fingers — that have very sharp eyesight — you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close together like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps and that they form various clearly defined patterns such as arches circles long curves whorls etc. and that these patterns differ on the different fingers. […] “Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were changed in the cradle […] “A was put into B’s cradle in the nursery; B was transferred to the kitchen and became a Negro and a slave [Sensation — confusion of angry ejaculations] — but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you white and free! [Burst of applause checked by the officers.] From seven months onward until now A has still been a usurper and in my finger record he bears B’s name. Here is his pantograph at the age of twelve. Compare it with the assassin’s signature upon the knife handle. Do they tally?” The foreman answered: “TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL!” Wilson said solemnly: “The murderer of your friend and mine — York Driscoll of the generous hand and the kindly spirit — sits in among you. “Valet de Chambre Negro and slave — falsely called Thomas á Becket Driscoll — make upon the window the fingerprints that will hang you!”Ah but Twain has more in store for the reader. Chambers is sentenced to life in prison. But this ending is clearly not despairing enough for Twain. Something even more terrible even more horrible even more ironic is required. And so despite the endless twists and turns of the story Roxy’s greatest fear comes true. Tom’s estate is insolvent. The creditors are anxious and angry. If Chambers goes to prison for life they get nothing. However if he is sold as chattel down the river the estate can recover some money. The last lines of “Pudd’nhead Wilson” must have given Twain enormous pleasure:Everybody granted that if “Tom” [Chambers] were white and free it would be unquestionably right to punish him — it would be no loss to anybody; but to shut up a valuable slave for life — that was quite another matter. As soon as the Governor understood the case he pardoned Tom at once and the creditors sold him down the river. FINISLibrary of Congress (Theatrical Poster Collection) Posters: Performing Arts PostersNature and nurture seem complicit. And neither seem to matter much. Chambers is a bad guy and his bad genes (based on race or otherwise) will out. Tom deprived of the education which was presumably his due is left in “a most embarrassing situation.” No reading no writing no manners. Nothing good can come of any of it. But as they say in the late-night infomercials “That’s not all.” A truly miserable end is guaranteed. Fate intervenes to insure the worst of outcomes.Why imprison Chambers? The problem of what to do with him is nothing more than the problem of what to do with “erroneous inventory.” He is nothing more than chattel and hence should be sold down the river. His “identity” is revealed to us — the readers of Twain’s novel — through his fingerprints. But there are deep rumblings of unseen machinery that dictate the outcome. Indeed no amount of dissembling can hide his identity from the end he’s destined to meet.It is the appointment in Samarra — the predestined end. But there is a better literary reference than John O’Hara. It is James M. Cain the author of a story about a man guilty of murder who is executed for a crime he didn’t commit. Fate hooks onto us and drags us unceremoniously to some predetermined end.Cain and Twain. It’s the belief that the postman always rings twice. [23]It may all go back to this question of what makes us unique? What uniquely identifies us? What tells us that Chambers is Chambers and Tom is Tom. We assume that we are unique. I am myself and no one else. But can I prove it? To myself or anyone else? What if fingerprinting fails to provide unique identification? Tom has been disambiguated from Chambers in Twain’s novel but recent evidence suggests that fingerprints may not be unique. Even though identical twins have different fingerprints given a sample of 100000 or 1000000 or 1000000000 are there no two people with the same prints? Recent studies suggest that fingerprinting may be less unique than we might think.We might think of fate as proof that God had uniquely identified us for his own mischievous purposes. Even if we cannot identify Jezebel God must know who she is. Isn’t he omniscient? Doesn’t he know when the sparrow falls? Doesn’t he know Tom is Tom Chambers is Chambers and that Roxy has committed a sin for which she too must be punished.Does God (or fate) see beyond our physical characteristics to something deeper — to something beyond a fingerprint? To our essence? To what makes us unique? Not just who we are but how we have become who we are? And what we will become? Leibniz tried to deal with this very question with his idea that the world is a skein of interlocking interdependent pieces. Everything determined in advance. Leibniz’s God knows everything in advance and has made a decision about what we will experience what will happen to us what we deserve. We evade nothing; it is guaranteed that we will get our just deserts.*******[1] There is an account of Melville’s height in the recent and massive biography by Hershel Parker “Melville vol. I. 1819-1851” Johns Hopkins 2005. As we have seen Melville’s 1849 passport application listed his height as 5’ 10 1/8″. In 1856 in preparation for another voyage he applied for a new passport and sent in a new set of measurements; in the intervening seven years he had apparently shrunk. Parker tells the story: “Doing as he was told Melville filled in the printed form and returned it for the State Department files. He had written carefully in his best hand but when he finished he folded it over before all the ink had dried thereby creating a small smudge. He was 37 years old. He had listed his height as five feet eight and some fraction of an inch but the smudge obliterated whatever fraction he had put down…In the actual passport Melville put his height at 5’ 8 3/4″ presumably what he wrote on the State Department copy where the fraction was smudged.” [pp. 292-293]Curiously the differing heights Melville listed the 1849 and 1856 applications both diverged from an earlier record of Melville’s stature. Again Parker: “The earliest record of his mature height at almost twenty is in the crew list of the St. Lawrence which he signed on June 3 1839. There he gave his height as 5’ 8 1/2″. The height Melville listed on his passport in 1849 (5’ 10 1/8″) is curious on two grounds. First the difference between 8 1/2 and 10 1/8 is unusual since it is somewhat infrequent for a man to grow 1 5/8 inches after the age of twenty. Second while a man will say he is 5’ 10 1/2″ or even 5’ 10 1/4″ a man will not ordinarily give his height in eighths of an inch. … As evident from the personal descriptions in the crew list of the Acushnet for instance it was common to measure by the quarter inch but not a smaller unit. Melville’s hyperprecision in this matter is poignant in retrospect because it magnifies the discrepancy between how tall he said he was in 1849 and how short he said he was in 1856. If it is unusual for a man to grow 1 5/8 inches between the ages of twenty and thirty it is still more unusual for a man to shrink 1 3/8 inches between the ages of thirty and thirty-seven. The height Melville gave in 1856 may be his honest acknowledgment that sciatica and other physical ailments of the past several years had literally reduced his stature – an example of the same honesty that had earlier led him to acknowledge procrastination to be a “sad failing.” [p. 293] I have a slight problem with Parker’s account. It suggests that these different recorded heights are accurate – and that Melville might have actually grown and then shrunk some 1 1/2”. Nowhere does Parker suggest that Melville may have reported his height incorrectly or perhaps was embarrassed by his actual height and sought to exaggerate it or minimize it. (Could the 1/8” detail – which as Parker admits is “unusual” – be motivated by Melville’s awareness that he was exaggerating his height and therefore thought to bolster the credibility of his claim by giving some absurdly precise measurement?)Graphic by Daniel MooneyIt is possible that his first successful efforts at writing literally increased Melville’s physical stature and then the effort of writing “Moby-Dick” “Bartleby” and “Benito Cereno” — three of the greatest works in American literature — caused him to fold in on himself by nearly an inch and a half. A more plausible explanation however is that the self-reporting of personal details is not entirely reliable.[2] Melville would not be allowed to take the SAT. Collegeboard.com makes a point of including in their list of unacceptable ID at testing sites “Written physical description of the student (without photo) even if written on school stationery and signed by a counselor or principal.”[3] The following photographs are from an extensive collection at the Library of Congress. They show bertillonage at the New York City Police Department ca. 1908-9.[4] “Bertillon did not believe in the possibility of the practical use of finger prints because of the great difficulty of finding a means of classifying a large collection of them… He says expressly ‘Unfortunately it is quite undeniable notwithstanding the indefatigable researches of Mr. Francis Galton in England that these designs do not present in themselves elements of variability sufficiently striking to serve as a basis in a collection of many hundreds of thousands of cases.’” Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead” 1918.[5] The earliest known police photograph (and a few others) is reprinted in an article by a Belgian criminologist Theophile Borgerhoff “Les premières photographies judiciares” Bulletin de la Société d’Anthropoligie de Bruxelles Vol. XXXV (1920).[6] In his book “La Photographie Judiciarie” [R.A. Reiss La Photographie Judicaire Charles Mendel Publisher Paris France 1903).] Reiss mentions an article in the Sept. 10 1854 issueof the Journal des Tribenaux written by Pellis a Swiss lawyer. Pellis tells the following story:“We still remember the newspaper reports on the many thefts in churches and private residences that occurred in the last year. Because of the curious circumstances surrounding these thefts one was led to believe that a clever and important gang was involved. The startling thing was that no traces were ever found after any of the crimes had been committed. The thieves disappeared into thin air none of the stolen objects turned up and no strangers were noticed. It became obvious that many accomplices had to be involved that fast means of transportation were available and that the goods were disposed of at faraway places. Several men were finally picked up and brought before the Justice of the Peace in Lausanne. Among the suspects there was a mysterious person whose name and antecedents were unknown and against whom it was very difficult to find anything but vague suspicions because he had succeeded in keeping out of the spotlight. The Justice had a portrait taken of the prisoner who was suspected to be dangerous. This was done by the daguerreotype process. He sent copies of it to the police of all the Swiss cantons and to law enforcement agencies in the neighboring countries. Not much success was expected from this novel attempt but finally news came in from the Grand Duchy of Baden that the suspect had been recognized in the village where he had lived. The villagers furnished the suspect’s name and details on his tumultuous youth. The investigation was continued and wardens of the many prisons where the suspect should have been detained were interviewed. He was recognized everywhere and all called him very sly. Confronted with the depositions and the evidence the suspect did not resist long and made important confessions.”[7] “From 1862 copies of photographs of criminals taken by prison governors were sent to Scotland Yard and formed a ‘Rogues Gallery.’”[8] //www.archive.org/details/cu31924096989177[9] From the King James version (as elsewhere): “And the LORD said unto him Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him.” (Gen. 4:15) Although no one knows what the mark of Cain was or even if it was really a mark at least one commentator Rabbi Michael Berg has suggested that it was the letter “waw” or “vav.” One of the many ironies of the story is that in Genesis the mark given by God to protect Cain marked him for persecution.[10] The first account of this story comes from the landmark study of fingerprinting vs. bertillonage “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead” by Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth published in 1918.[11] Wilder and Wentworth “Personal Indentification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead” (1918) pp. 31-33. It is unclear whether the story of the two Wests was responsible for the eventual failure of bertillonage and for the ascendancy of fingerprinting. It might have been a cautionary tale created (or emphasized) ex post facto as a way of highlighting the deficiencies of bertillonage.[12] A recent discussion of the story of the two Wests can be found online. Robert D. Olsen Sr. “A Fingerprint Fable: The Will and William West Case”: “A search of the literature on fingerprint identification reveals that the alleged Will and William West case was not reported in print until Wilder and Wentworth’s account in 1918 (26). Please note that of the 26 books and articles listed in the bibliography 18 were published prior to the release of Wilder and Wentworth’s book and none of the 18 mention the West case. Of particular note is that two of the items listed in the bibliography were by the records clerk who took the Bertillon measurements and the fingerprints of Will and William West but who never mentions the incident. One is immediately struck with the thought that a pioneer in the establishment of fingerprint identification never attached much significance to a case in which he played a very important role. Perhaps the case was not as important as we have been led to believe?” from//www.scafo.org/library/110105.html (This story appeared in the November 1987 Vol. 37 No. 11 issue of Identification News which was the next to the last issue prior to changing publication format and becoming the Journal of Forensic Identification.) It is interesting that Bertillon measurements were discredited but photography and the use of proper names for identification survived.[13] In “Personal Identification” Wilder had written “Chinese are proverbially difficult of identification by the ordinary facial recognition. … The same is true of Negroes and all peoples of a race unlike that of the examiner where the racial characters stand out so sharply as to obscure the finer details upon which recognition largely depends.” From Simon Cole “Suspect Identities” p. 144.[14] Simon Cole “Suspect Identities” (Harvard University Press 2002).[15] Recent work by Simon Cole and others has shown that fingerprinting may be less reliable than thought. And the claim that fingerprints are unique has not been scientifically tested.[16] I myself was confused by the bowler.[17] Galton asks slightly different questions: “For most criminal investigations and for some other purposes also the question is not … ‘Is A the same person or a different person from B?’ but the much more difficult problem of ‘Who is this unknown person X?’” Francis Galton “Finger Prints” p. 154. Sharrona Pearl (in “About Faces: Physiognomy in Nineteenth-Century Britain.” Cambridge Mass. Harvard University Press) makes an additional point. Galton’s identification was prosecutorial. Pearl writes: “For Galton the primary use of somatic identification was to prosecute the guilty rather than to exonerate the innocent. In an inversion of Eastlake’s argument (discussed in Chapter 1) that physiognomy protected unfairly targeted strangers Galton argued that ‘in civilized lands and in peaceable times the chief use of a sure means of identification is to benefit society by deflecting rogues rather than to establish the identity of men who are honest. Is this criminal an old offender? Is this new recruit a deserter? Is this professed pensioned personating a man who is dead? Is this upstart claimant to property the true heir who was believed to have died in foreign lands?’” (206).[18] The attentive reader will remember that that same verb (“attach”) was used by J.S. Mill in respect to proper names and the things they name in Part 1 of this essay.[19] There are two issues here: universal identification – uniquely picking out an individual from a crowd; and fixing the human personality – determining just what it is that makes a person unique. Perhaps in the same sense that Fox Talbot one of the inventors of photography described the process of photography as “fixing the shadows.”[20] There have been endless debates about the literary merit of “Pudd’nhead Wilson.” Even Hershel Parker Melville’s biographer mentioned above has weighed in on this issue. In an article “Mark Twain and Pudd’nhead Wilson: A House Divided” (Novel: A Forum on Fiction Vol. 16 No. 1 autumn 1982) George Toles writes: “The most provocative recent criticism of Mark Twain’s Pudd’nhead Wilson … urges us to dismiss the novel as a hopeless botch laughably unworthy of Leslie Fiedler’s long-ago claim that it is one of the most extraordinary books in American literature. Hershel Parker the editor of the Iowa-California edition of the novel has judged the work to be flawed throughout by compromises and ‘unreconciled contradictions’ not the least of which are to be found in its ‘gaudy’ barnburner ending. To talk about Mark Twain’s intentions in regard to ‘Pudd’nhead Wilson’ Parker maintains ‘is to risk absurdity at every word.’” As much as I hate to join a fractious literary dispute Parker is even more wrong in his denunciation of Twain’s work than in his assessment of the underlying reasons for Melville’s “change” in height.[21] Twain “Puddn’head Wilson” Chapter II. One has to pay homage to the sheer perversity of Twain’s language. Roxy is a slave and hence disenfranchised. Nevertheless one-sixteenth of her is able “to outvote” the other fifteen-sixteenths of her and to effectively disallow the possibility of her voting in an election or even being a citizen in the antebellum South even though she would never be allowed to vote anyway.[22] O.K. I should provide a spoiler alert. For all those fearful that hearing what happens at the end of “Pudd’nhead Wilson” will undermine the enjoyment of reading it I suggest you abandon this essay immediately. My own two cents’ worth of opinion. I like to know endings in advance. It means I can concentrate on something more interesting than plot.[23] Alas these associations are everywhere. The protagonist of “The Postman Always Rings Twice” is named Chambers the same as in “Pudd’nhead Wilson.” Although Cain professed to have no idea about the meaning of “the postman” in his title I believe he is being unnecessarily difficult. Who could the postman be — other than Death?
 242,  2018, a, ROME — Retaliating against a remarkable campaign from within the church to force the ouster of Pope Francis the Vatican’s former spokesman issued a statement on Sunday night questioning the credibility of an archbishop who has accused Francis of covering up sexual misconduct.But in seeking to defend the pope against the latest allegations which relate not to abuse but to the pope’s own credibility the former spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi seemed to confirm a key part of the archbishop’s claims. And the defense also offered a portrait of the pope and his top advisers as having been politically naïve.In a letter released Friday the archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò challenged the notion put forward by Vatican officials and the pope that he had ambushed Francis in 2015 by setting up a private meeting at the Vatican’s Washington embassy with Kim Davis the Kentucky county clerk who became a conservative celebrity by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Archbishop Viganò said in the letter that he had fully briefed Francis and his top advisers all of whom he named about Ms. Davis and her “conscientious objection” to promoting same-sex marriage. He received approval from them all he said.

 5395,  1987, a, ''Most of them were living in New York and Jewish'' she said ''and most of them were doing other things like driving taxicabs. It was a wonderful experience for them to show their work.''After that she produced a show of American graffiti artists ''Off the Wall'' by street artists in their teens and 20's. She has been asked to replicate the show in Paris using both American and French artists.Even though she is still not breaking even in earnings (Kowa Realty has donated the space and she subsidizes her expenses from her touring business) she is enthusiastic about the project. She is already planning to present a group show of international lithographs and silkscreens this spring along with shows by artists from Italy and Austria. Eventually she hopes to set up a show of art by Russians in the Soviet Union.Her affinity for the visual arts comes naturally. Her grandfather was an art collector. Her father was a painter philosopher and avid reader and ran a family silk design and art textile business. Her seven brothers and sisters are all involved in aspects of the arts as painters film directors musicians fabric designers and yoga instructors.Ms. Hillyer who was born in Osaka Japan and raised in Kyoto studied piano composition and musicology at Toho Conservatory in Japan and then emigrated to study at Boston University planning to be a musician. There she met her husband Raphael Hillyer the founder of the Juilliard String Quartet. She abandoned her performance aspirations and traveled with him for three years as a backstage wife where she learned about the practical aspects of the music world.''When I got tired and bored I started helping artists'' she said. ''It was very useful to me.''In 1970 she formed Kazuko Hillyer International Inc. a performing arts production and management concern that produces about 2000 events a year and has arranged tours for a variety of clients including the Metropolitan Opera the Grand Kabuki the Jewish Theater of Rumania and the Zambia National Folk and Music Ensemble. She has also arranged tours for more than 40 international orchestras and managed the careers of numerous performing artists.She has also taken a leading role in many humanitarian causes. Several years ago she was walking on the beach in the Hamptons and asked herself ''Why hasn't anyone done anything for the Cambodian boat people? Maybe that's because they're Asian and don't have any representation here.''

 2712,  2003, a, Attorney General John Ashcroft has ordered federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for a murder suspect even though he had agreed to testify against others tied to a deadly Colombian drug ring in exchange for a life sentence.A Justice Department spokeswoman while declining to comment specifically on the case said that the department's decisions on capital cases were intended to assure consistency in the application of the federal death penalty.Lawyers said it appeared to be the first case nationally in which Mr. Ashcroft had insisted on seeking the execution of a defendant who had secured a promise of life in exchange for information. Some lawyers said his decision here could hamstring federal prosecutors in the toughest cases because it would shake defendants' confidence that a federal prosecutor at the local level could deliver on a proposed deal in a death penalty case.Mr. Ashcroft has stirred a controversy in federal prosecutors' offices nationally in recent months by insisting that they seek executions in some cases in which they had recommended against it. Under Justice Department rules local federal prosecutors can only recommend whether to seek the death penalty; the final decision is up to the attorney general.

 2661,  2004, a, In a program note for his Carnegie Hall recital on Thursday evening the pianist Andras Schiff wrote that he thinks "in terms of projects and not just single concerts." That seems to have been his approach all along: 25 years ago he seemed focused on Bach and concentrations on Mozart Bartok and Schubert followed.Lately he has been interested in Janacek although not for the first time. He recorded the composer's music for Decca in the early 1990's and for ECM more recently. In the last couple of weeks he played in two Janacek-centered chamber concerts at Zankel Hall (although in one his own performance was in a Dvorak work) and at his recital he offered Janacek's three most substantial piano works "On the Overgrown Path" (Series I) the Sonata "1.X.1905" and "In the Mists."Mr. Schiff finds a universe in these three scores. The tuneful folk-tinged portraits embody both recollections of the rural Moravia of Janacek's youth and sorrow over the death of the composer's daughter in 1903. Those may not seem to be extremes. Nostalgia after all often has a melancholy tinge. Mr. Schiff navigated these currents deftly and his success at keeping the distinctions clear paid off in his poignant reading of the final vignette "The Barn Owl Has Flown Away" where nostalgia and grief intermingle.The sonata which commemorates a riot in Brno in which a student demonstrator was killed and "In the Mists" an introspective often brooding work are denser more sharp-edged scores. Mr. Schiff's accounts of both thrived on clarity of texture and a fine balance of the dramatic and the emotional and in the Sonata especially his fluid tempos put the music's passions in high relief.

 3039,  2002, a, ''The faculty is nervous'' said Dr. Larry Frohman a neurological ophthalmologist at University Hospital in Newark part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. ''Many of us think is that this is about money not excellence. My feeling is that the commission was handed its conclusions before the report was written.''The plan unveiled in October by a commission appointed by Governor McGreevey recommended that the three research universities be recast as a single university of 64000 students with semiautonomous campuses in Newark New Brunswick and Camden. It also recommended consolidating leadership of the proposed new university by creating the position of chancellor. The commission that produced the 114-page report was headed by Dr. P. Roy Vagelos a retired chief executive of Merck & Company who is a former faculty member of several medical schools.The plan has been embraced by the New Jersey Institute of Technology and tepidly endorsed by Rutgers. But current and former officials at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey have been highly critical of the proposed merger which is not surprising since the commission report lamented the school's reputation and said acidly that ''the goal of excellence has not been achieved.''The volley was recently returned by Stanley S. Bergen former president of the university who said: ''The report's methodology is inconsistent and poorly documented. It scrutinizes U.M.D.N.J. under a microscope examines Rutgers with the naked eye and glances at N.J.I.T. through a telescope.''Any reorganization would require the approval of the State Legislature and take years to put in place. First the governor plans to appoint a task force that will develop a blueprint for creating the new university. As Mr. McGreevey has frequently said his overarching goal is the improvement of the state's medical schools with the goal of attracting tens of millions of dollars in federal and private grants for medical and biotechnical research.

 1654,  2009, a, Mark CornelisonSeth Davis a writer for Sports Illustrated and college basketball analyst for CBS is the author of “When March Went Mad: The Game That Transformed Basketball.” It’s a look at the 1979 N.C.A.A. title game that featured Magic Johnson’s Michigan State team against Larry Bird’s Indiana State squad. In an e-mail interview Davis discussed both players the impact the game had on the sport and whether we will ever see anything like it again.Magic vs. Bird is one of the most famous individual rivalries in sports history. When you started this book were you worried that almost too much was known about them?Not really because I knew I was reporting on a time in their lives that was not well-known to the public. There was certainly much about them that I didn’t know before embarking on this project. For example I had no idea just how close Larry Bird came to never playing college basketball. If Bill Hodges who had just gotten hired as an assistant at Indiana State in the spring of 1975 hadn’t managed to gently coax Bird off a garbage truck and convince him to give college one more try we would have never heard of Larry Bird. Likewise I learned a lot about Magic’s childhood specifically the fact that when he was a teenager he was bused to a mostly-white school with no basketball tradition. And of course the story of that season had many fascinating twists and turns that I never knew about. Most of the people who watched the 1979 championship game were seeing these guys play for the first time so the details about what brought them to that historic first meeting are not well-known even to most of their biggest fans.You weren’t able to talk to Johnson or Bird. Are there questions that you would have liked to ask Johnson or Bird that you didn’t get a chance to?I would like to have had the chance to try to get them to go beyond the sugar-coated anodyne versions of what went on back then that they usually try to tell. It’s not that I would have trolled for controversy but as a reporter you’re always trying to get closer to the truth. But those guys have been such open books – literally so since they both wrote autobiographies and have had numerous books written about them not to mention the hundreds of interviews they have given – that it’s unlikely they would have told me something fundamentally new. If anything not talking to them liberated me so I could view them with a more of a reporter’s critical eye. Maybe if I had spent a lot of time of them I would have subconsciously tried to please them as I wrote.The championship game itself was a little underwhelming. Bird had one of his worst games of the season and Michigan State was in control from the outset. Still the audience for it was enormous. What was it about this game that drew so many people to it? Was it simply the personalities of the two stars? Would it be remembered so fondly if Magic and Bird didn’t become Magic and Bird?It was to coin a phrase a perfect storm. First and foremost people really understood that these guys were unique and uniquely talented players. They were big men and they were making it cool to pass. Then you had the whole David-versus-Goliath thing. Indiana State was this little-known school from the Missouri Valley Conference with the mysterious farm boy and yet somehow they made it all the way to the final game undefeated. Were they really that good? In a one-and-done scenario that was extremely alluring. The fact that Bird was white and Magic was black added to the sexiness of the matchup but the biggest reason there was such a huge audience was simply because there weren’t that many viewing options back then. Instead of 800 channels there were only 4. As for them becoming Magic and Bird that obviously would not have affected the 24.1 Nielsen rating they generated that night but because of what they went on to accomplish this is one of the rare instances when an event that was huge at the time it happened has only grown in significance as recedes further in the rearview mirror.Can you talk a little bit about the news media coverage of the two players? While both received more than their share of praise (including each being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated) they were also the focus of heavy criticism at times. For example David Israel of The Chicago Tribune excoriated Bird for not talking to the press and Bill Gleason of The Chicago Sun-Times called Johnson “a mediocre passer and ball handler.”Well it’s all relative of course. The media coverage back then was only a fraction of what it would be today. But it’s amazing to think that Larry Bird who in many ways was the biggest story in college basketball that season went basically the entire year without talking to the press. Can you imagine a high-profile athlete pulling that off today – or even wanting to?They both had their share of skeptics as to how well their skills would translate into the N.B.A. especially since they weren’t naturally gifted athletes. The main difference is that while Bird couldn’t stand dealing with the media Magic absolutely relished in it yet he did it in a way that somehow never alienated his teammates. With them he was just a down-to-earth guy who treated everybody well. It speaks volumes about his personality and character that he was able to be a larger than life media icon (especially in Lansing) yet his teammates loved him. Maybe it has something to do with the number of easy buckets he got them!Phil Martelli can take some solace in the fact that Billy Packer was not too impressed the first time he came across Bird and Indiana State. What sort of insight did Packer give you into the season especially as someone who sort of became a lighting rod for Sycamores fans?Yes the more things change the more they stay the same! One thing people don’t realize about Billy Packer is that not only is he willing to admit when he’s wrong he actually enjoys being proven wrong. I will say that Billy never did quite get out of his mind-set that the only high-quality basketball is being played in major conferences. But a lot of people doubted whether Indiana State was for real that season. I really really enjoyed talking to Billy about everything that happened just like I always enjoy talking to him about college basketball history. He has a great memory terrific insights and he always tells you what he thinks no matter the consequences.This book deals with more than just Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird of course. Indiana State Coach Bill Hodges emerges as one of the more interesting characters not least because of what happened with his coaching career after that title game. How much did you know about Hodges when you started and what’s your perspective on him now?How much did I know? I didn’t even know the guy’s name. Seriously even if you asked the most ardent college basketball fans the question of who was Bird’s coach in that game I’ll bet almost none of them could tell you. And yet as you said he turned out to be probably the most interesting character in the book. Bill has really been through a lot both good and bad. A lot of people in his situation would have emerged with bitterness and regret but Bill has a great perspective on all that has happened. He is currently a high school history teacher in Roanoke Va. and he genuinely enjoys his job his life and spending time with his grandchildren.I can understand why he was able to convince Larry to get off that garbage truck. I would have played for the guy too if he asked me.A similar question about Jud Heathcote who went on to have a successful career at Michigan State after Johnson left. He seems like quite the character.For literary grist it’s hard to imagine a better subject than Jud. He is smart blunt and absolutely hilarious. It was interesting for me to go back to that time and learn more about what he was like and what his players thought about him. Today we think of Heathcote as this hilarious old codger but the reality is his players really did not like him. They did however respect his basketball knowledge. They had a lot to sort through as a unit to make it to that title game. He had to give a little which wasn’t easy for him but at that stage in his life there was only so much he was going to change. He had a pretty bad health scare last summer but it seems like he has come through O.K. and he’s as ornery as ever. God bless that man.The outcome of this game clearly still gnaws at Bird. Without giving too much away the closing scene shows him as still broken up about the outcome. Were you surprised by how much the game has stayed with both players especially Bird?That’s something that didn’t surprise me because we all know what intense competitors those guys were. The reason it gnaws so much at Bird is because he knows it’s something he can never get back. When Magic won an N.B.A. title or an M.V.P. award Larry could always say “I’ll get mine next year.” But this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and only one of them could prevail.And even though they’re great friends now they’re still competitors and Magic will always have the last word. I also think Larry’s regret stems largely from his affection for the community of Terre Haute. He knew how much this game meant to them and he still feels like he let them down.In this day and age with wall-to-wall sports coverage on television and on the Internet could we ever have a situation like this again?Absolutely not. That’s what makes it such a great story to revisit. We still get great games and great individual matchups but you have to remember this game was literally the first time most people had seen these guys play.Take for example what Bryant Gumbel said the night of the game when he hosted the pregame segment for NBC: “If you haven’t seen Larry Bird play you’re in for a treat.” Think about it – in my current role for CBS would it have ever occurred to me to say before last year’s championship game “If you haven’t seen Derrick Rose play you’re in for a treat”? There was an innocence back then a delayed gratification that paid off eventually in spades. I love watching wall-to-wall basketball as much as anyone but in a way it’s a shame that that element of the unknown is gone now. A little mystery goes a long way.

 12808,  1934, a, With the close of business yesterday the Federal Treasury ended the first three-quarters of the current fiscal year with a deficit of about $2500000000. In round numbers this is an increase of $1350000000 since Jan. 1. If the deficit should continue to increase at the same rate during the next three months it would amount at the end of the fiscal year in June to a little less than $4000000000.

 1988,  2007, a, A warm welcome to our great friend the esteemed Judge Kay and all the members of the Court of Appeals. A warm welcome to all those joining me in being sworn in today. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and my partner Lieutenant Governor David Paterson.My deepest thanks are to my parents; my wife Silda and our three wonderful daughters.Today we come together to mark a pivotal moment in our state’s history a day that in the rhythm of democracy marks a transition and a new beginning.It is with profound humility about the task that lies before us and filled with great hope for what I know we will achieve that I stand before you to announce that Day One of our time for change has arrived.As we step outside on this first January morning of 2007 the light of a new day shines down on the Empire State once again.The opportunity at the heart of this day is unique to our times but not new to our history. As the writer Russell Shorto has aptly noted New York created the model for the kind of society that would be duplicated throughout the country and around the globe: Our state was born as an island at the center of the world.What began as a babble of dialects and peoples struggling to find a way to live together searching for balance between chaos and order liberty and oppression became a symphony of democracy.Under the shadow of liberty’s torch generations of weary travelers have sailed into New York harbor believing that of all the places on Earth this was the land where people could come and find the chance to make their world anew.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThat no matter how great the hardship no matter how daunting the challenge the promise of our democracy makes it possible to overcome the greatest odds so that we — individually and as a society — may arrive at a greater good.And so it was for those first immigrants who came with little and worked long days to give their children a better life.For the bold governor Dewitt Clinton who ignored the warnings of the skeptics and cynics and built an Erie Canal that so many had said was wasteful impractical and impossible.For the reformers of Teddy Roosevelt’s day who dared to take on the political machine and inbred corruption in order to give government back to the people.For the suffragists and union members and civil rights heroes who organized and marched on our streets to win their chance at the American dream.For the inventors artists and entrepreneurs who have turned our state into a beacon of hope ideas and opportunity.And so it must be for us. Like all who have come before we have arrived at this moment on this day because we have demanded a different and more vibrant future for our children.Because we know that New York is the state where the depth of our talent and the breadth of our skills and the reach of our culture have forever changed America and the entire world — and because we know we can do it once more.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThis election was not about electing one person as governor. Rather it was about what we the people collectively elected for the future of our state.We chose pragmatism and ethics over partisan politics and dysfunction and we demanded an end to gridlock.So I pledge to toil each and every day so as not to disappoint the hard working people of this state who have placed their trust in this future — a future which rekindles hope and restores growth.Today we stand in the midst of a global revolution that has transformed the way we live and the way we work. Creativity and prosperity travel wherever the brightest minds and most innovative economies can be found.Over the last decade we have seen what can happen when our government stands still in the face of great challenge and inevitable change.We’ve seen it in the burdensome property taxes and the health care we can’t afford; in the jobs that have disappeared from our upstate cities and the schools that keep failing our children; in a government that works for those who hold office — not those who put them there.Like Rip Van Winkle the legendary character created by the New York author Washington Irving New York has slept through much of the past decade while the rest of the world has passed us by.Today is the day when all of that changes — when we stop standing still and start moving forward once more.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAnd while I wish I could tell you that either a single election or a different party or even a new governor alone is enough to do this — I cannot. While I wish I could tell you that change will be easy — I don’t believe that you elected me to do what’s easy.Easy is spending your tax dollars without consequence or sacrifice. Easy is saying yes to supporters and no to opponents. Easy is looking the other way while costs rise debts mount and families lose ground. Easy is what we’ve had but easy is not where we need to go.Let us remember the lessons of two great governors Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt instructed “It is only through labor and painful effort by grim energy and resolute courage that we move on to better things.”And Franklin Roosevelt advised us to be “bold” and to recognize that people demand “action and action now.”Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.I have no doubt that we can move on to better things in this state — that we will find ourselves on the winning side of history once more.But to be number one again we must be one New York again.And so in order to return to policies of opportunity and prosperity we must change the ethics of Albany and end the politics of cynicism and division in our state.If ever there was a time that called out for introspection by those in government it is now. Lincoln spoke of listening to “the better angels of our nature.” Indeed those of us who work in the great building behind me must hear and heed the serious responsibility that public service demands and rise to this moment and show the public in words and in deeds that we understand that our responsibility is to the people of New York.The reform we seek is substantial in size and historic in scope.It will require a new brand of politics — a break from the days when progress was measured by the partisan points scored or the opponents defeated. No longer can we afford merely to tinker at the margins of the status quo or play the politics of pitting one group against another. We must replace delay and diversion with energy and purpose in the halls of our capital.What we needed now more than ever is a politics that binds us together a politics that looks to the future a politics that asks not what is in it for me but always what is in it for us.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyWe must embrace a progressive vision of government once more — a vision that upholds the values of individuality and community; of entrepreneurship and opportunity; of responsibility and fairness. No one any longer believes in government as a heavy hand that can cure all our ills but rather we see it as a lean and responsive force that can make possible the pursuit of prosperity and opportunity for all — by softening life’s blows leveling its playing field and making possible the pursuit of happiness that is our God-given right.It is both tempting and understandable for each of us to focus on the problems and concerns within our own neighborhoods our own cities our own regions and our own businesses. But for any one of us to succeed we must succeed as One New York.A state that is not urban or rural upstate or downstate Republican or Democratic but first and foremost New Yorkers — striving together reaching together working together toward our common dream.And so together we must strive to build One New York through a politics that operates on the principle that we rise or fall as one people and one state.We will succeed not because we point fingers or refuse to budge but because we compromise enough to find principled consensus and because we listen enough to find wise solutions.Not everyone will agree with this vision and some will not support these solutions. Indeed we will make mistakes. But progress we will have — measured by our core values.Our purpose is not reform merely for the sake of reform but to restore fairness and create opportunity and redefine the very fabric of our community.Some may feel anxiety over changes that seek to make businesses more competitive but all will benefit from an Innovation Economy that attracts young people and new businesses in every part of New York.Advertisement Continue reading the main storySome may express skepticism over a school system that demands more accountability from students teachers and parents but all will benefit from an education that rewards excellence and gives every child the best possible chance in life.Some may feel threatened by health care reforms but all will benefit from a system that finally puts patients first at a cost that all families can afford.Some public officials may not want to face stricter ethics rules and more competitive elections but all citizens will win when we finally get a government that puts the people’s interests openness and integrity first.With most of these reforms there will be those who say we can’t we shouldn’t and we won’t.They will peddle the politics of cynicism that we must now make the politics of yesterday. Because if we band together and succeed in our efforts our future will mean a New York that values the dignity of each person — and once more offers opportunity for all.Every policy every action every decision we make in this administration will further two overarching objectives: we must transform our government so that it is as ethical and wise as all of New York and we must rebuild our economy so that it is ready to compete on the global stage in the next century. The simplicity of articulating these principles belies the complexity of the task. But victory will be ours as it must be.And so on this day of unbridled hope and possibility I ask you to think not only of the challenges and aspirations that you hold in your own hearts but of those that are held in the collective heart of New York.This One New York includes Chris Kelder and his family who have farmed their land in Ulster County for more than two centuries passing their dreams on to each successive generation.It includes today’s immigrants whose lips speak the languages of Spanish Chinese Korean French and an infinite array of dialects from all over the world.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyToday’s immigrants enrich our state with their vitality and their vision in the same way as the immigrants of the last century. All these different tongues translate into the incomparable work ethic of New York.And it includes the brave immigrants who came through Ellis Island over the last century in search of a better life one of whose grandsons stands here in front of you today the embodiment of their dreams.Each of us comes from a different place and from a different background. Each has faced their own tests and trials along life’s journey.But throughout the history of New York what has always united us as a people is the recognition that we are all on this journey together and if we’re willing to catch each other during our stumbles and look out for one another during the tough times we have it in our power to remove any obstacles in our path and walk toward that brighter day.No matter how great the challenge — no matter how impossible the odds — our destiny will never be a path to follow but always a trail to blaze.And so on this new day of a new year I ask not just for your support but also for your cooperation your patience and your participation in making our dream real once again.As New York’s former Governor Theodore Roosevelt once remarked there can be no great progress without first entering the arena.My fellow New Yorkers: join me in that arena.Lend your sweat your toil and your passion to the effort of building One New York of which we can all be proud.My fellow New Yorkers. Our moment is here.Day One is now.Together let’s build that One New York. Let’s walk toward that better day.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThank you and God bless.

 2714,  2003, a, A court ruling last week in Nebraska has dealt a devastating blow to the nation's program for policing meat safety. It calls into question the government's authority to shut down meat plants for repeatedly violating sanitary standards designed to combat bacterial contamination and outbreaks of food-borne illness.Judge Joseph Bataillon of the Federal District Court rebuffed an Agriculture Department effort to shut down the operations of Nebraska Beef an Omaha slaughterhouse with numerous citations for violating standard sanitary operating procedures. The plant was chosen for special scrutiny after the discovery last year of deadly E. coli bacteria in ground beef produced by a Nebraska Beef customer. In granting a temporary restraining ordering blocking the closure the judge elevated the economic interests of a local employer over public health while questioning the government's power to act under current law.All this has a familiar ring. Just two years ago in a different case a federal appeals court in New Orleans declared that the Agriculture Department lacked the power to close a Dallas beef processing plant that had failed three rounds of tests for Salmonella contamination in a year. Unfortunately Congress and the Bush administration failed to heed the message of that misguided decision by passing a law that reaffirms the government's authority to enforce health standards.Reacting to the new ruling the Agriculture Department has decided to reach a settlement with the meat packer that allows the plant to continue to operate. It is hard to fault the department's lawyers for wanting to avoid a drawn-out court fight likely to result in an adverse final decision by the judge. But even now Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman refuses to acknowledge the grievous damage inflicted on her department's food safety efforts by the courts' suggestion that the government has no authority to close a plant based on public health considerations. She still hesitates to get behind legislation sponsored by Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Richard Durbin of Illinois Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and others that would close this and other gaping holes in the nation's food safety system. That is inexcusable.

 4780,  1991, a, George Speri Sperti a research scientist who invented a wide range of products including a sunlamp and the patent medicines Preparation H and Aspercreme died Monday at St. Elizabeth Medical Center North in Cincinnati. He was 91 years old.Mr. Sperti who lived in Burlington Ky. had suffered several strokes and probably died of an abdominal aneurysm a spokesman for the family said.Mr. Sperti who developed Aspercreme for arthritis relief and Preparation H the hemorrhoid treatment held more than 120 patents. He also devised methods to enhance Vitamin D in milk and to freeze-dry orange juice concentrate.Mr. Sperti studied electrical engineering at the University of Cincinnati and got his start as an inventor while in college. Using materials from his mother's kitchen and part of a hacksaw blade he fashioned a device to measure the consumption of electricity by large industrial users. He sold the invention to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $30000. Profits Donated to Research
 5494,  1987, a, I'M an election inspector.Election inspectors two from each major party hang up the flag and unseal the voting machines at 6 o'clock in the morning on Election Day. At 9 o'clock in the evening we take down the flag close the polls count the vote and reseal the machines. In the interim we are charged with seeing that the election proceeds in a legal and orderly manner: No one may vote more than once. Anyone who is registered and still a resident may vote. No one may campaign in the voting area. No one should be trapped in the machine because they can't figure out how to open the curtain.It isn't a complex job nor is it a dangerous one in our country today. It is a unique opportunity to observe American democracy operating at the very bottom of its grass roots.Last Election Day I witnessed the 15 hours of the general election in one election district in Westchester County. I'd like to report:The election was legal and orderly. A substantial percentage of the registered voters in the district people of all ages and parties and interests came out to vote. Some of them were particularly notable.More parents than ever before brought their young children to the polls. They brought them in order to take them into the voting booth and show them how to vote. Often there were four or six or even eight feet visible below the closed curtain . . . one pair of size 9's and a variety of much smaller ones. The children learned by explanation and by example how democracy works in our town and our country.

 4801,  1991, a, The suffering of the Iraqi people cries out for compassion. Shortages of food medicine clean water and electricity now threaten to cause more death and disease than the Persian Gulf war. Indeed the worsening plight of Iraq's vulnerable children and powerless adults virtually demands some easing of the economic sanctions. Why make the Iraqi people suffer for the crimes of Saddam Hussein?But the sanctions remain one of the few levers by which the allied coalition hopes to disarm Iraq's nuclear chemical and biological capabilities. As Iraq disdainfully evades international inspectors the allies know they need every bit of pressure they can muster.There may be a way out of this dilemma: Permit Iraq to resume oil exports but impound the earnings and apply some of them to humanitarian assistance.Satellite photos and defectors' reports make clear that Iraq continues to violate the terms of the United Nations cease-fire. Iraq supplied misleading accounts of its nuclear arms program and still tries to conceal arms-making equipment and facilities from international inspectors. As if to underscore reports that Washington is weighing military options President Bush says "all means necessary" may be used to enforce the cease-fire resolution. But bombing during the war did not succeed in eliminating Saddam Hussein's nuclear capacity.

 310,  2017, a, The president of Russia Vladimir V. Putin articulated a possible legal strategy on Wednesday for scores of Russian athletes preparing to defend themselves in sports doping prosecutions: casting doubt on the chain of custody for their urine samples.“When we provided the test samples there were no complaints” Mr. Putin said going on to describe the microscopic scratches on glass sample bottles that investigators said showed that Russia’s Federal Security Service had cracked into them to switch out the athletes’ incriminating urine.“If there was a problem with scratches of whatever kind this should have been noted in the relevant reports but there was nothing of this sort. In other words these samples were stored somewhere and we cannot be held responsible for the storage conditions” he said.The scores of glass bottles in question from the 2014 Sochi Olympics — bottles thought to be tamper-proof before last year’s scandal — have been stored by the International Olympic Committee in a secure lab in Switzerland for the last three years.

 5548,  1986, a, Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth yesterday suspended for one year Keith Hernandez of the Mets Dale Berra of the Yankees and five other major league players for cocaine use. However Mr. Ueberroth offered to lift the suspensions if the players agreed to certain conditions including contributing 10 percent of their salaries this year to programs to combat drug abuse and submitting to drug tests for the remainder of their careers.Four other players were suspended for 60 days with the bans to be lifted if they give 5 percent of their salaries to drug programs and agree to testing.The commissioner also said he would require 10 other players to undergo testing for the remainder of their careers because of past use of cocaine. These 10 are not to be penalized. Reason for Suspensions Any of the players involved who have positive tests for cocaine marijuana morphine or heroin would automatically be subject to the suspension Mr. Ueberroth said. Similarly those who refuse to be tested would be subject to the suspensions which would be effective opening day. Those suspended would not be paid.The one-year suspensions were handed out to those players who Mr. Ueberroth said had not only used drugs themselves but had also ''in some fashion facilitated the distribution of drugs in baseball.'' He said these players had shared drugs with teammates and in some cases introduced players to drug dealers.
 262,  2018, a, When Matt Damon did his Brett Kavanaugh imitation on “Saturday Night Live” you could tell that he nailed it before he said a word. It was all about the face — that sneering rage-filled scowl. Kavanaugh didn’t sound like a judge at his Senate hearing last week  let alone a potential Supreme Court justice; he didn’t even manage to look like one.But then again Lindsey Graham who went through the hearing with pretty much the same expression on his face didn’t look much like a senator either.There have been many studies of the forces driving Trump support and in particular the rage that is so pervasive a feature of the MAGA movement. What Thursday’s hearing drove home however was that white male rage isn’t restricted to blue-collar guys in diners. It’s also present among people who’ve done very well in life’s lottery whom you would normally consider very much part of the elite.In other words hatred can go along with high income and all too often does.At this point there’s overwhelming evidence against the “economic anxiety” hypothesis — the notion that people voted for Donald Trump because they had been hurt by globalization. In fact people who were doing well financially were just as likely to support Trump as people who were doing badly.

 2021,  2007, a, My football allegiances are to the Philadelphia Eagles though considering my recent travel itinerary I suspect you could call me a Saints fan: St. Lucie to St. Petersburg to St. Louis and let me say it’s great being here at Busch Stadium for opening day. All the seats here are red although with seemingly everyone wearing the same color it’s tough to tell who’s standing or sitting.This is my second opening day as a beat writer and the third one I’ve covered and it never ceases to amaze me how subdued the clubhouse is beforehand. When I walked in the Mets’ clubhouse at 3:40 CDT this is what I saw:*Jose Reyes and Lastings Milledge sitting reading copies of Baseball America.*Jose Valentin plopped in front of his locker working on a SuDoku puzzle.*Ambiorix Burgos breaking in his glove in front of his locker with headphones on.*Aaron Sele feet up on a shelf reading “Crossroads of Twilight“.*Endy Chavez playing golf on his PSP.*Paul Lo Duca on a couch trying to watch golf on one TV and the Suns-Mavericks game on another.*Tom Glavine munching on some Cheerios.In other news the Cardinals are honoring their 1982 world championship team tonight and Keith Hernandez the SNY broadcaster and former Met was introduced. During our pregame interview session with Willie Randolph the manager was incredulous that Hernandez was taking part as a Cardinal and then in a week was throwing out the first pitch at the Mets’ home opener.“He’s a Met; he’s not a Cardinal” Randolph said.

 4065,  1996, a, Mike Tyson dispatches his opponents so quickly that one of the country's major cable operators has offered an unusual discount to pay-per-view fight fans who have cried foul after shelling out $39.95 or more.If Tyson 30 dispatches the 34-year-old Evander Holyfield -- or vice versa -- in Round 1 of their bout on Nov. 9 subscribers will pay only $9.95. But for every round the bout goes beyond that there will be an additional $9.95 charge up to a maximum of $49.95 if it lasts until the fifth or beyond.The arrangement was proposed yesterday by Jim Dolan the head of Cablevision which is in 2.8 million of this country's 60 million households that are wired for cable television. He said that the pricing gimmick was a way to deal with people who were resentful over fights lasting less than a round. ''We wanted to correct that'' Dolan said.But officials in Las Vegas Nev. where the bout will be expressed concern that the arrangement could affect the credibility of the bout which would generate more money for Cablevision the longer it lasts.

 4642,  1992, a, Acting just minutes after a 12:01 A.M. deadline today the New York City Council approved bills that prevent a substantial increase in property taxes for owners of condominiums cooperatives and rental apartment buildings. The action came less than an hour after the State Senate paved the way for the Council's action.Property taxes for a typical condominium or cooperative apartment will increase by about $49 over the next year or less than 4 percent as a result of the bills according to calculations by the City Council staff. The bill for a typical owner of a one-  two- or three-family house will decrease by about $14.The Senate and the Council acted to block significantly higher increases for the owners of apartments that would have resulted from a decision three weeks ago by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment. The state board ruled that owners of apartments and apartment buildings should pay a larger share of the city's property taxes.The board's decision could have caused the tax bill for a typical apartment owner to go up by as much as $123 a year according to the city's Finance Department and it could have caused the typical single-family home owner's bill to decrease by $76.
 5498,  1987, a, ''THE first time I realized he had an AIDS-related illness is when I went to visit him in the hospital'' said the president of a manufacturing company in lower Westchester referring to one of his clerical employees. ''Two weeks later he was able to come back to work. However due to a company restructuring that took place before he went to the hospital he works on the night shift alone so I really don't know how our other employees would have felt about working side-by-side with him in the office.''They don't seem hostile but my guess is that some of them would have treated him like a pariah'' the executive continued. ''People are so terrified of AIDS that they act irrationally. As an employer facing human concerns and a magnitude of medical and legal problems brought on by the AIDS epidemic I'm extremely worried. My fear is that we're just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg in the work place.''His fears and the fears of many other employers came under scrutiny at a recent conference on AIDS that was presented by United Hospital and held in White Plains. ''If you don't have cases of AIDS yet'' one participant warned ''just wait - you'll have some by tomorrow.''The representatives of 100 Westchester companies heard one panelist Dr. Leon J. Warshaw fault companies that ignored the serious implications of AIDS in the workplace. Dr. Warshaw executive director of the New York Business Group on Health an industry-labor coalition that was a co-sponsor of the conference referred to AIDS as a catastrophic illness and advised companies to gird for an AIDS epidemic. He recommended that they develop corporate policies to deal with such issues as adequate medical coverage and the legal rights of employees who have AIDS.
 3856,  1997, a, SOMETHING about midsummer turns ray guns and missiles and marauding spaceships into old news. Suddenly the most ferocious weapon on the movie screen is the English language as deployed so viciously by scheming Mamet-fueled white-collar workers in Neil LaBute's stunning Sundance prize winner ''In the Company of Men.'' At this time of year the big guns are silenced long enough to make way for such sleepers and they come as the perfect break between early summer's fireworks and the fall's more complex art house fare. What a jolt: we find ourselves surrounded by films by for and about real people on planet Earth.The culture shock of this backlash against studio extravagance is heightened by the free-for-all atmosphere that increasingly shapes the summer season. Summer counter-programming started out as a small idea with a few art house Davids mixed in among gun-toting Hollywood Goliaths but now it has truly caught fire. As a result nearly all the highlights of this year's Sundance Film Festival along with a few notable successes from Cannes and elsewhere on the festival circuit will be competing for similar audiences during a tight midseason time period. But this year there are fewer clear standouts. And there may be more small deserving films than the traffic will bear.Still the oversupply of interesting independent films is the kind of problem we can welcome. Whether startlingly assured work (Mr. LaBute's film) or just a highly promising debut (Miguel Arteta's ''Star Maps'') each of these films bodes well for a thriving independent film world. The further good news is that a cycle of slouchy myopic coming-of-age films has given way to much more adventurous subject matter and that the independent film world often outdoes Hollywood in blending intellect with humor. In a year that began with ''The Daytrippers'' and ''Chasing Amy'' and today brings the acerbic cleverness of the Australian ''Love Serenade'' (both a Cannes and Sundance entry) it's clear that sly single-minded thinking is alive and well.Strong personality is the hallmark of every one of these films for better or worse. Running the risk of abrasive self-importance is always a liability for independents but excesses can be exhilarating when they come from the heart. Tom DiCillo's ''Box of Moonlight'' dares to resurrect the hippie-dropout scenario of the 1970's (with considerable fresh energy and with a much lighter touch than the thematically similar ''Dream With the Fishes''). And late this month comes ''She's So Lovely'' a fiery revival of John Cassavetes's punch-drunk romanticism as filtered through the eyes of Nick Cassavetes the filmmaker's son.

 270,  2018, a, That is what preview audiences are doing at “The Cher Show.”“I stand on stage every night and I feel them wanting to say thank you to Bob. It’s a tidal wave” Mr. Berresse said.Mr. Moore the director said: “Everyone who knows who Bob is — and that’s a lot of our crowd — is overjoyed to see his designs and those who don’t know him know who he is now.”Such attention can be daunting even for a veteran like Mr. Mackie. Because he is shy by nature content to stand one step outside the spotlight in which his leading ladies blaze it has been hard for him to make peace with seeing a version of himself on a Broadway stage.“All I said was please don’t play me like a nelly officious old queen who comes in with sketches under his arm” he said. The designer’s dancing doppelgänger doesn’t do that.“It’s important to me that I honor this person that I admire so much” Mr. Berresse said. A navy blazer man in real life Mr. Mackie did let himself have some fun with his onstage counterpart’s clothes. The fictional Bob at one point enters wearing a very groovy python jacket. “Bob said ‘You know I would never wear anything I’m making for you’” Mr. Berresse said.Regardless when Mr. Mackie attends a performance at the Neil Simon these days he is often greeted by adoring fans. “I get to watch people mob him and want to get their pictures taken with him and get his autograph” Mr. Suarez said. “To be a small part of him having a big moment makes me beyond happy.”The toughest critic of “The Cher Show” — Cher — is also overjoyed with this aspect of it. “There is simply no one like Bob Mackie” she wrote in her email. “I love him. Always have. Always will.”
 271,  2018, a, SÃO PAULO Brazil — For Natalia and Rubens Ortega the only remaining question is: Glock or Taurus?The young couple signed up for a gun-training course at a shooting club in São Paulo just days after Jair Bolsonaro a far-right former Army captain was elected Brazil’s next president on the strength of his promise to upend the status quo and combat crime.For a population angered by the last few years of political and economic turmoil and worried by escalating violence Mr. Bolsonaro’s vow to break with Brazil’s restrictive attitude toward weapons and make it easier for “good guys” to own guns was particularly resonant.“We want to get back in practice so we can buy a pistol when it happens” said Mr. Ortega who has joined a wave of Brazilians preparing for a widely expected relaxing of gun restrictions. “We just can’t decide which one.”Mr. Bolsonaro’s tough-on-crime stance helped catapult him to the head of a splintered race in a country reeling from a record-level epidemic of violence. Last year there were roughly 175 homicides per day in Brazil according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. Often simulating gunfire with his fingers at campaign rallies Mr. Bolsonaro said he would combat the homicide epidemic by easing firearm laws and giving the police more freedom to shoot suspects.

 5029,  1990, a, Flower and vegetable displays lined the banquet room at Tavern on the Green and spilled onto a sunny terrace last week a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.There were masses of flowers including New Guinea impatiens in shades of lemon ivory or pink on deep bronze green; pale pink and deep rose vincas and geraniums with rose-freckled pink petals.And there were bouquets of cream yellow and crimson roses as fragrant as they were beautiful.The mounds of vegetables included yellow green and orange squashes Chinese blue cabbages purple-on-white Japanese eggplants and yellow canary cherry tomatoes.Stealing the show on the terrace though was a huge basket shaped like a three-leaf clover that overflowed with vegetables prepared for pre-luncheon nibbling.
 2554,  2004, a, The International Accounting Standards Board on Wednesday issued what are supposed to be its final rules before Europe adopts international accounting standards in 2005 but the final shape of an important rule on derivatives unpopular with many financial institutions could change.''We committed that people would know what the accounting would be by the end of March'' said Thomas Jones vice chairman of the standards board which is based in London. ''We are putting the last two pieces out now.''The two rules announced Wednesday are a revised standard for insurance companies and proposed changes in the rule on accounting for the use of derivatives whose value depends on that of an underlying security.In each case the board made changes aimed at reducing the volatility that will appear in financial statements while still allowing investors a better understanding of how well companies are doing.
 370,  2017, a, That hackers managed to steal $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank generated headlines because of the size of the heist. But what interested cybersecurity experts was that attackers had taken advantage of a previously unexplored weakness in the bank’s computers by undermining its accounts on Swift the international money transfer system that banks use to move billions of dollars among themselves each day.It was an unprecedented form of cyberattack. But since then the cybersecurity firm Symantec has found the method used against banks in 31 countries.The malware discovered by Darktrace researchers stopped short of being a full-fledged A.I.-driven piece of software. It did however learn while it was in the system trying to copy the actions of the network in order to blend in.“What was concerning was that this attack once it got into the network used A.I. techniques like trying to learn the behaviors of employees on the network to remain undetected for as long as possible” Ms. Eagan said. She said she saw a future in which countries raced against one another to hire people skilled in developing complex algorithms that could be used to run such malware.Ms. Eagan’s company which has headquarters in Cambridge England and San Francisco has increasingly found hacking incidents in India since it expanded there.As other cybersecurity companies enter Southeast Asia Africa and other parts of the world where they have not had much presence they will continue to discover new types of malware being tested in those markets said Allan Liska a senior threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future a cybersecurity firm based in Somerville Mass.“For several years Taiwan and South Korea have been proven testing grounds for some of the more advanced groups in China” Mr. Liska said. “Those countries have high-speed internet widespread internet penetration and not a lot of security infrastructure in place.”

 5514,  1987, a, New proof of the links between mental problems and overall health has been mustered in a large study of 29915 Federal employees and their families who filed claims for mental-health treatment with Aetnafrom 1980 to 1983. The average of their claims for health problems of all kinds - not just psychological problems - was $158.82 a month more than 70 percent higher than health insurance claims of 16468 other Federal employee families with the same coverage but no mental problems. On an encouraging note after mental-health treatment the group's use of both mental and general health care declined to $137 a month according to James O. Blose an analyst with the Human Ecology Institute in Chapel Hill N.C.Despite the downward trend however the average claim for people with psychological problems remained higher after three years of mental-health treatment than the average - $108 a month - three years before treatment was started.Mr. Blose and Harold D. Holder director of the Prevention Research Center in Berkeley Calif. published these findings in the October issue of Hospital and Community Psychiatry.Dr. Kessler of American Psychmanagement said large employers had recently been paying more attention to their mental-health costs which often are rising 25 percent. Not soon enough however said Kenneth S. Abramowitz a health-care analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. ''Very few employers intelligently manage their mental-health benefits'' he said. ''Corporate America has got to rethink its whole atttitude toward mental-health benefits and I don't see them doing that until they get totally taken to the cleaners.'' Jeff Goldsmith head of Health Futures a Chicago management consultant firm is equally vehement. ''One of the hottest areas for cost containment over the next two or three years will be in-patient psychiatric services because of widespread abuse'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''So much of what they are doing could be moved to an out-patient basis.''One method for minimizing hospitalization is a process known as case management. Service companies like Dr. Kessler's keep track of each mental-health claim. The case managers who usually are psychiatric social workers or nurse clinical specialists advise physicians about alternatives to hospitalization which may cost $4000 per patient.

 6480,  1970, a, Fifteen years ago polio struck the young American pi anist Carol Rosenberger while she was studying in France. But Miss Rosenberger who made her New York recital de but at Alice Tully Hall on Tues day night turned that formid able hurdle into a catapult. In every way her recovery has been complete and then some.The attractive blonde's play ing disclosed no technical weakness of any kind not even in the thorniest thickets of Beethoven's final sonata tile Olympian C minor (Op. 111). The tricky transitions in the Arietta were not only smooth but highly musical and she avoided communicating any feeling of pianistic strain in the finale's strenuous trilling which so often distracts the listener from Beethoven's more interesting communications. Her Op. 111 while perhaps not as noble or ethereal as it some day may be and too concerned with tidiness came together nicely. At the other end of theBeethoven spectrum were the Bagatelles (0o. 119). some of which are literally child's play of a grand sort. The Detroit born pianist kept things in per spective and the pieces sang elegantly. Here touches of blandness and an occasional tendency to miniaturize were less out of place than in Op. 111 where they also could be heard.The remainder of the pro gram ranged the side roads of the 20th century post‐romantic literature. Szymanowski's 12 Etudes (Op. 33) rippled flaw lessly and Miss Rosenberger's fluent technique — she has wrists as supple as snakes— could always be admired though the pieces themselves remain as a special taste. Faure's Barcarolle No. 5 (Op. 66) also ably played wanted more warmth of tone and more suggestion of the music's wa tery ebb and flow.
 4261,  1994, a, Despite what he calls continuing abuses of human rights in China the United States Ambassador here argues that Beijing has made "dramatic" progress in improving the lives of its citizens and that this record should be taken into account when policy toward China is reviewed early in the new year.In an interview this week Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy said that the setbacks in human rights represented by the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the wave of repression that followed were being steadily reversed and that the Communist Party had loosened its control over many aspects of Chinese life.His comments came before a Congressional review in January of China's record on human rights. Before July President Clinton must decide whether China has made "overall significant progress" in human rights and thus deserves to have its beneficial trade status renewed. Question of Progress on RightsMr. Roy 58 a career diplomat who is to complete his tour in Beijing next summer said he could not predict whether China would satisfy the standard of "overall significant progress."

 4309,  1994, a, Doug provided a serious 20-minute lecture on raft safety. He explained what to do if we were tossed into the rapids -- lean back keep your legs up let the water carry you forward never try to put your feet down to stand you might get caught under a rock and dragged under -- and how to escape if you fall in and get caught under the raft. The neophyte rafters glanced around nervously. Most of us were first-timers whose biggest worries had been falling out of the raft and where we'd go to the bathroom. But we donned our life jackets and scrambled onboard. Our fears lifted as the boats caught the current and the journey began.We were hardly around the first bend in the river when we spotted two moose drinking near the water's edge. The wildlife generally steers clear of the human traffic because of an annual fall hunting season in the region that leaves the wildlife wary year round. But during the week we spotted several eagles soaring far above our heads lots of bighorn sheep scrambling across sheer rock a black bear and a varied assortment of mink snakes ducks and marmosets.At our first campsite I noticed what I assumed were bobcat or mountain lion tracks right next to our portable toilet. Malcolm confirmed that bobcats were local residents.Nervous apprehension about the rapids gave way after the first few rides through serious white water. Those of us who braved the front of the raft got the wettest; those in the back got the more thrilling ride. While not for the faint of heart these rapids amount to a great roller-coaster. By the end of the trip the white knuckles gripping the safety ropes had loosened and everyone was hoping for at least one Class IV experience. The river eased us in giving us two days of increasingly thrilling rides that peaked on the third and fourth days with treacherous white water at Salmon Falls and Vinegar rapids both of which were close to Class IV experiences.At Salmon Falls Steve a real-estate manager for the University of California took a scary spill in his first ducky ride and slid like a child's toy through the white water safe but shaken. But the river with its swift currents and swirling eddies is hardly the whole experience. Each campsite provides its own wonders. At one Melanie an art teacher from Moscow Idaho and a lifelong outdoors enthusiast lead a few of us up the canyon where she found the skeletal remains of a young buck untouched after it had died the previous winter.At our last campsite a ragged bighorn sheep wandered into camp and started nibbling on sneakers and T-shirts left out to dry. The determined scavenger would not be chased away virtually demanding a handout for herself and an adorable lamb that followed her deftly down the rocks.Holiday for an additional $50 provides tents sleeping bags mats and rain gear. David my travel companion is a former Boy Scout but we still fumbled helplessly with our tent the first night. By the end of the week we were pros.

 224,  2018, a, WASHINGTON — President Trump called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday to end the special counsel’s inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election issuing an unambiguous directive on Twitter to shut down an investigation that even now is scrutinizing his tweets for evidence of obstruction.The White House and Mr. Trump’s lawyers moved quickly to minimize the president’s statement dismissing it as merely a case of venting by a president who has grown increasingly angry with an investigation that he considers illegitimate — and not a direct order to a cabinet secretary to interfere with a continuing federal law enforcement matter.But in saying that Mr. Sessions the United States’ top law enforcement official should take specific action to terminate the investigation the tweet crossed a line that Mr. Trump has never explicitly crossed — until now. It immediately raised more questions about whether Mr. Trump was attempting to obstruct justice already an issue being examined extensively by Robert S. Mueller III the special counsel leading the investigation.The trial of Paul Manafort Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman which entered its second day Tuesday has made the stakes of Mr. Mueller’s investigation increasingly clear. And even as Mr. Trump was calling for the investigation to end it was revealed that he had pushed his lawyers to make another attempt to reach an agreement to sit for an interview an objective that the president has long sought because of his belief that he can convince Mr. Mueller of his version of events.

 585,  2015, a, To the Editor:New York City municipal elected officials who continue to deny residents the opportunity to shop at Walmart should read "Walmart’s Overdue Pay Raises" (The Upshot by Neil Irwin Feb. 22). They feel that we should oppose Walmart because of substandard salaries and unfair competition they would provide against smaller stores.Construction of a new Walmart can provide work for construction contractors and their employees. Once opened there are employment opportunities for many workers. The city would benefit by millions in sales payroll and real estate tax revenue which could help fund essential municipal services everyone desires.Consumers have voted with their feet all over America making Walmart the retail merchant success story it is today. For those “politically correct” don’t shop at Walmart but give everyone else a choice.Larry PennerGreat Neck N.Y. Feb. 23

 1869,  2008, a, But there was another nine hours of music at Wednesday’s Ponderosa Stomp. One remarkable set was by the gospel pianist and singer Davell Crawford–celebrated in New Orleans for his untrammeled virtuosity–backing up his grandfather James (Sugar Boy) Crawford who had a career singing secular music decades ago. Not now: James Crawford was singing gospel. He was giving thanks for his recovery from a police beating years ago that fractured his skull and initially left him paralyzed and blind in long lines that rose from humility to joyful affirmation. All around his steadfast melodies Davell Crawford was a tsunami of improvisation: surging ostinatos and florid filigree tremolo chords and keyboard-spanning glissandos excess as exaltation.Another strong set was by Syl Johnson a Chicago bluesman who made soul hits in Memphis with the Hi Rhythm Section. (Among his recordings is the first version of “Take Me to the River” a hit for Al Green and later Talking Heads.) His Chicago-Memphis amalgam is durable. He topped the calm unswerving beat of the Memphis band with the barbed guitar lines and aching desperate phrases of the blues in songs like the pointed “Is It Because I’m Black.”There was also cranked-up Louisiana blues from New Orleans regulars King Lloyd and Guitar Lightnin’. There were soul shouters with dramatic vocal buildups (Roscoe Robinson) raunchy stage antics (Ralph Soul Jackson) and even politics: the Mighty Hannibal segued from bawdy comedy to a song endorsing Barack Obama.Ronnie Spector belted girl-group songs full of yearning for the right guy. Roky Erickson the Texan rocker who has grappled with mental illness led the Explosives in a set of taut supercharged rockers–laced with Texas blues folk-rock and proto-punk psychedelia–as he sang about visions of demons.In the long night’s finale Rudy Martinez better known as Question Mark of Question Mark and the Mysterians bounded onstage in a frilly-sleeved cropped top fit for a Las Vegas showgirl along with his cowboy hat and shades. Defying age he was in constant motion around the stage singing about lust and hormonal overload over the band’s merrily pumping organ riffs–as frenetic and well-preserved as a record collector’s most prized vinyl artifacts.
 2897,  2002, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students learn about the history of major American music genres. Then through mock radio shows students examine the distinguishing features of each genre and how each has changed throughout the years.Author(s):Rachel McClain The New York Times Learning NetworkJavaid Khan The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Identify different American music genres.2. Learn about the winners in this year’s Grammy Awards by reading and discussing the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys U2 and ‘O Brother’.”3. Research the history instruments key musicians composition and themese of different American music genres.4. “Produce” radio shows representing their genres.Resources / Materials:-recording of 20-30 second selections of six different songs representing the following American music styles: rhythm and blues jazz bluegrass rock hip-hop and country-tape recorder or CD player to play the recording-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys U2 and ‘O Brother'” (one per student)-resources with information about the history of different American music genres (encyclopedias library resources computers with Internet access)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class prepare a recording of 20-30 second selections of six different songs representing the following American music styles: rhythm and blues jazz bluegrass rock hip-hop and country. Write the names of these styles on the board. At the beginning of class have students number a sheet of paper one to six. Explain that you will be playing six short music selections for the class. As each selection plays students should write the style of music they think the selection represents. Play the recording twice so that students can confirm their answers. Then go over the answers as a class discussing the different elements of each of these different styles of music such as rhythms common instruments and melodies. Why are these genres considered to be American? Who are some current popular performers in each genre?2. As a class read and discuss the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys U2 and ‘O Brother'” focusing on the following questions:a. What CD won album of the year in this year’s Grammys?b. How does the author of the article describe the film “O Brother Where Art Thou?”c. Who won best country vocal collaboration?d. According to the article what was “one of the night’s most poignant moments”?e. What awards did Alicia Keys win?f. What awards did U2 win?g. How does Bono feel about the effect of September 11 on his music?h. What were some of the answers to the question about why bluegrass and roots music dominated the Grammys?i. What “message to the industry” came from the classical field?3. Explain to students that they will be working in groups to investigate different American music genres and then create mock radio shows representing their findings. Divide class into six groups and assign each one of the styles from the initial class activity. Using all available materials each group researches their assigned type of music to discover the answers to the following questions (written on the board for easier student access):–When and where did this style develop?–Who have been the major figures (songwriters performers bands etc.) in this style since its birth?–What instruments are associated with this style of music and what roles do they play?–What are the standard rhythms melodies chords and other musical features of this style?–What are some common topics or themes addressed in the lyrics that accompany this style of music?–How has this style of music evolved since its inception to today?Then each group begins planning a mock radio show exploring the history of their assigned style of music. Each group should include ten recordings from the earliest years of the music’s “recorded” existence through today. Over the course of the show music selections should be prefaced with spoken introductions addressing the information from the research questions and explaining how the key figures and standard musical features of the genre have changed over the years. Before the end of class groups should divide responsibilities for finding and bringing in the recordings.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups compile and “produce” their radio shows tape recording them to play in a later class classes as part of an “American Music Festival.”Further Questions for Discussion:–How would you define “American music”?–What is your favorite genre of music? Is there a genre you really dislike? Why?–What is “popular music”? What genres fit into this larger category?–What do you think the outcome of the Grammys says about people’s musical tastes?–Do you think that the Grammy Awards are a measure of talent popularity or both? Why?–Do you think that most artists consider a Grammy Award to be a sign that they have “made it”? Do you think there are artists who do not place importance on the Grammy Awards? What might be the reason for these different points of view?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in initial class activity and class discussion group research and accurate and thoughtful American music genre radio shows.Vocabulary:contention climax wreaked vengeance poignant elliptical fervent paeans predicament turmoil consolidation underdogsExtension Activities:1. Compose and perform your own song (music and lyrics) in one of the music styles explored in the class activity. Keep in mind the defining features of this style when creating your song.2. Create your own “After Mozart” recording (or live performance) modeled after Gidon Kremer and Kremerata Baltica’s album. Choose a classical music piece that lends itself to modern electronic “sound effects” and perform your rendition for the class.3. Create a “fun facts playbill” to accompany this year’s Grammy Awards. Include information on this year’s nominees and artists who performed in the show. Provide general information about the artists as well as little-known facts such as childhood nicknames pet peeves and favorite foods. (Browse Internet fan sites for this obscure information.)4. Film a rockumentary about a current musician who you think has contributed the most to American music. Combine real and “fake” (staged between you and a friend playing the role of this musician) interview footage that highlights this artist’s achievements. Also include performance footage and interviews with people in your community commenting on this musician’s contribution to American music.Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics- Research the controversy behind the unauthorized use of copyrighted music such as Vanilla Ice’s use of “Under Pressure” in “Ice Ice Baby” or Lauren Hill’s cover of “Killing Me Softly.” Find an instance where the case went to court review the judge’s decision and write your own decision about what you think should have been the outcome of this conflict.Economics- Learn about cases in which music groups (such as TLC) or artists (such as Elton John) with top-selling albums are forced to declare bankruptcy. Then write a “Financial Guide for New Recording Artists” that includes tips about how to enter into fair contracts manage their money and deal with financial hardship.Geography- Research “home-grown” music genres from around the world. Choose a music genre from another country to present to your class. Dress up in costumes that reflect the culture that the music you chose represents and bring in instruments unique to this genre. Perform excerpts from songs that exemplify the genre’s unique features.Mathematics- Poll students in your school to find out about their music listening and purchasing habits. Compile your results in an article for your school’s newspaper.Media Studies- Watch “O Brother Where Art Thou?” Review the soundtrack of the film in terms of the following questions: How does the soundtrack enhance the film? Does the music ever detract from the plot of the film? Does the film rely too heavily on the soundtrack too little or is there just the right balance?Other Information on the Web:The Grammy Awards site (//grammy.com/) offers information on the 44th Annual Grammy Awards the history of the award audio and video of performances and more.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Music Standard 7- Understands the relationship between music and history and culture.

 6397,  1970, a, The adaptability of opera to the exigencies of televi sion has long since been demonstrated and although we do not see many operas on the TV screen nowadays it is not because the art form and the medium are incom patible.It is somewhat surprising therefore that England (Brit ish Broadcasting Corpora tion) has elected to turn back the clock as it were and ignore much of what has been learned in the past about the effective presen tation of TV opera in the ex pensive and elaborate per formance of Benjamin Brit ten's “Peter Grimes” that will be shown on Channel 13 (WNDT) at 7:30 this eve ning. (The opera was pre sented in other parts of the country over the N.E.T. net work last night.)•“Peter Grimes” which is now 25 years old is prob ably the best‐know and best liked mid‐20th‐century op era. Its style is rooted in the past but its psychological overtones and moderately modern musical idiom give it a continuing contemporary flavor. Based on a poem by George Crabbe the libretto by Montagu Slater recounts the tragedy of a lonely am bitious fisherman.This performance was taped at Aldeburgh Festival Hall in England in February 1969. The composer conduct ed and Joan Cross was the stage director. Instead of using the multiple‐studio technique developed years ago to achieve maximum word clarity and judicious balances between singers and instruments over‐all miking was used. And medi um and long‐shot photogra phy to emphasize environ ment was favored over close‐ups that stress char acter impact.

 3350,  2000, a, The nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work programs violated federal law by paying lower wages to women than to men placed in the same jobs in a Milwaukee warehouse according to a decision made public yesterday by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.The company Maximus Inc. has been under mounting criticism for its business practices in recent months. A state judge in Manhattan has held up the Giuliani administration's plans to award Maximus more than $100 million in contracts to help welfare recipients find work. And state auditors in Wisconsin recently found that the company had billed the state for $466000 in improper or questionable expenses.The federal commission's ruling found that a woman placed in warehouse jobs by MaxStaff the company's temporary employment agency was paid $7.01 an hour while five male co-workers got $8.13.''We're obviously very disappointed with the determination'' said Rachael Rowland a spokeswoman for Maximus. ''We respectfully disagree with it. We remain confident that no discrimination occurred in this case.''
 975,  2013, a, Thomas Lohnes/Getty ImagesFRANKFURT — Shares in Deutsche Bank rose for a second day after the bank sold 2.96 billion euros ($3.87 billion) in new stock on Tuesday to help it bolster the size of its capital reserves.Deutsche Bank has long faced criticism that its capital buffers the money that banks set aside to absorb losses in a crisis were inadequate and that it carried too much risk from derivatives and other volatile investment banking products.But since taking over last year Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen the bank’s co-chief executives have been hoarding profit and selling assets to raise the proportion of capital to money at risk. Bank officials insisted that the share sale was not done in response to pressure from regulators in Europe or the United States.“It was our decision” Mr. Jain said on Tuesday during a conference call with analysts. “There was no gun to the head.”Still the move will go a long way toward ending the bank’s reputation as one of Europe’s riskiest and least-capitalized lenders. The new capital will allow it to rank near the top among large European banks in the size of its reserves rather than near the bottom and to comfortably meet new regulatory requirements.The bank also raised more than it aimed for when it first announced the share sale on Monday. Institutional investors paid 32.90 euros a share for the new equity Deutsche Bank said a discount to the market price in Frankfurt on Tuesday of 35.03 euros.Shares of Deutsche Bank the largest German lender rose 5 percent in New York trading on Tuesday on expectations that the share sale will clear the way for higher dividend payments even though an increase in the number of shares lowers each shareholder’s cut of profits.Mr. Jain and Stefan Krause the bank’s chief financial officer portrayed the share issue as a turning point that would set the stage for the bank to focus less on its baggage from the financial crisis and more on growth and profit.“We could see where a capital raise would bring us to the point where the capital issue was off the table” Mr. Jain said.European banks have as a rule taken longer to put the financial crisis behind them than American banks. The European lenders have had to deal with the burden of euro zone debt but they also faced less pressure from regulators to confront their problems. Lately though there have been signs that some of the bigger banks are returning to health.Investors had other good news to cheer from the bank this week. On Monday the bank reported that net profit in the first quarter rose nearly 18 percent to 1.66 billion euros from 1.41 billion euros in the period a year earlier.Though revenue rose a modest 2 percent to 9.4 billion euros the bank was able to cut costs. Mr. Krause said on the conference call that the bank expected to save about a billion euros over the full year.Some analysts were still cautious about the bank’s long-term prospects. The bank faces uncertainty over the European economy which is stuck in recession. It also continues to address an array of legal proceedings that could be costly to resolve.“Whilst we still see risks from litigation regulation and the macro environment the strengthened capital position should put the group in a better position to deal with these challenges going forward” analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients. Credit Suisse upgraded Deutsche Bank shares to neutral from underperform.Deutsche Bank also said it would raise an additional 2 billion euros later in the year in the form of so-called hybrid equity a form of debt that converts to shares in time of crisis and can thus be counted toward capital. The bank is waiting for German regulators to clarify rules for such instruments before it issues them.
 5352,  1988, a, The director of the $2.4 billion trust for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth control device made by the A.H. Robins Company yesterday announced the initial settlements that would be offered by the trust.A trustee Kenneth R. Feinberg estimated that as many as 100000 of the 195000 claimants might take the initial settlement payment which is not meant to compensate victims who received the most serious harm from the device.Under the initial payment which is being called Option 1 women who were injured by the intrauterine device will be offered $725. Husbands whose wives were injured and children were born with birth defects will be offered $300. And women who are unsure as to whether the Dalkon Shield caused their injuries will be offered $125.All claimants have the right to reject the Option 1 offers.Mr. Feinberg said that the trust was setting up Option 2 which would be a schedule for compensating more seriously injured users.

 7396,  1964, a, Panama's decision to break off earlier talks through the Inter‐American Peace Committee and take her charge to the Council has deeply disturbed Latin‐American Governments. As a result new high‐level attempts to find a solution to the dispute are expected.In what was regarded as the most violent attack by a LatinAmerican government on the United States since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba Mr. Moreno said: “We shall live under the constant threat of an armed North American attack.”He contended that as long as the “justice” of Panama's demands for a revision of the 1903 Canal Zone treaty were not met “the aggression remains latent along the border that separates the zone of the canal from the rest of the republic.”“The armed forces of the United States are there in a state of alert to halt the people of Panama in the exercise of its rights” Dr. Moreno said and then asked:“Can the sister countries of America leave Panama abandoned to her own fate at the mercy of the will of a power filled with its own strength and that has demonstrated that it is disposed not to recognize the rights of the Panamanian nation and what is worse to force it to submit to injustice through force?”Specifically Mr. Moreno asked the Council to constitute itself a ministerial‐level “organ of consultation” order an investigation of the Canal Zone riots and condemn the United States for “aggression.”
 1958,  2008, a, PUEBLO Colo. – Senator Barack Obama ridiculed the endorsement that Vice President Dick Cheney extended to Senator John McCain on Saturday asking voters here whether they believed that was a sign that Mr. McCain would take the nation in a new direction.“Do you think Dick Cheney is delighted to support John McCain because he thinks John McCain’s going to bring change?” Mr. Obama said. “Do you think John McCain and Dick Cheney have been talking about how to shake things up put Halliburton and get rid of the lobbyists and the old boys club in Washington?”Mr. Obama seized upon remarks that the vice president delivered at a Republican campaign event on Saturday in Wyoming where Mr. Cheney offered a forceful argument for Mr. McCain’s candidacy saying: “John is a man who understands the danger facing America he’s a man who has looked into the face of evil and not flinched.”For months Mr. Obama has been seeking to link Mr. McCain to the Bush administration. The comments from Mr. Cheney offered a fresh rationale for Mr. Obama which he pitched to Colorado voters in the second stop on a three-state that began in Nevada and ended in Missouri.“I’d like to congratulate Senator McCain on this endorsement because he really earned it. That endorsement didn’t come easy. Senator McCain had to vote 90 percent of the time with George Bush and Dick Cheney to get it” Mr. Obama said. “He served as Washington’s biggest cheerleader for going to war in Iraq and supports economic policies that are no different from the last eight years.”For Mr. McCain who has been working to distance himself from the administration the endorsement presented an awkward moment.A spokesman for the McCain campaign issued a statement responding to Mr. Obama’s remarks reminding voters that it was Mr. McCain who had opposed the Bush administration’s energy policy. Mr. Obama supported it.“Barack Obama and Dick Cheney aren’t just cousins they’ve shared support for the Bush energy policy and the out-of-control spending that John McCain has fought to oppose” said Tucker Bounds a spokesman for the McCain campaign.
 3599,  1998, a, TWO hotels are already operating adjacent to the PNC Bank site and three more are nearing completion nearby part of an 80-acre site dubbed Airport Interplex. Extended Stay America is adding 140 rooms and will be joined by a 140-room Hampton Inn and a Studio Plus property with 85 rooms said Jerry Segal senior vice president of Korman Commercial Properties Inc. Other off-airport lodging includes Embassy Suites Marriott Westin and Days Inn.''These are replacing lots of rooms that were very old said Mr. Segal. ''They can support the convention center because they're so close to downtown with the Eastwick rail station.''Michael G. French a principal with Coopers & Lybrand LLP in Philadelphia said aging hotels near the airport and the nearby sports complex have been renovated thanks to capital programs by hotel chains like Promus Corp. and HFS which recently purchased properties or chains that own hotels there.''The airport market in Philadelphia even in the worst of times always operated at healthier occupancy levels than Center City or other surrounding markets largely because for a long time it was under-supplied compared to other airport markets'' said Mr. French.''In 1991-92 the hotels were being operated by asset managers on behalf of banks or going through restructurings but even then the airport markets did well. The average occupancy is close to 80 percent and for that market it's at capacity because things are always soft on Sunday nights. Commercial travelers are increasingly inclined to come in have a meeting and get out.''In 1996 the Airport Council International reported Philadelphia had 1.6 million inbound and outbound international travelers a 27 percent gain over the year before. And US Airways the dominant airline serving Philadelphia intends to improve both its service and facilities here. Nevertheless many Philadelphia-area travelers depart from Newark or New York airports because of a limited number of international departures.Construction is under way in two of the airport's five terminals to add moving sidewalks and a 45000-square-foot retail mall.

 4822,  1991, a, AS soon the news of Time Warner Inc.'s rights offering was made public in early June investors reacted vehemently sending the stock down $21.25 a share to $95.75 within a week.The company's directors did not know what hit them. Several people close to the situation said the board had little idea the response would be so negative. The board which includes executives who have headed corporations like I.B.M. Xerox Macy and Borg-Warner also did not foresee that the opposition would last so long or that there would be such serious objections from the Securities and Exchange Commission.Nor was there any indication that the corporation's prestigous law firms -- Cravath Swaine & Moore and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison -- or the lead bankers in the deal -- Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch -- knew what was coming. "I don't think any of us expected the reaction to be as loud and vociferous as it was" said a director who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the board was surprised hat the rights offering was interpreted as a coercive one.The deal that was finally approved unanimously after a four-hour meeting on the afternoon of June 5 gave the holder of each share a sixth of a right to buy a new Time Warner share for $63 to $105 depending on the response to the offering. The aim was to issue 34.5 million new shares and raise $3.6 billion to pay down debt.

 4125,  1995, a, In Mr. Mo's case his publisher Chatto & Windus owned by Random House refused to meet his request for an advance of $:200000 or $316000. Nor did other British publishing houses. "We just couldn't see our way to paying an advance on that scale; neither could other publishers in London" said Jonathan Burnham the publishing director at Chatto. "It's all a matter of sliding scales and authors' reputations. And Martin Amis has now completely thrown the scale out of joint." Mr. Amis recently stunned London's publishing world by commanding an advance of roughly three-quarters of a million dollars for his forthcoming novel "The Information."Miffed Mr. Mo announced he would self-publish his new book a black comedy set in the Philippines and taunted his publishers with the remark that the new book has "the filthiest opening chapter of any book ever published." Three of his earlier works including his latest book "The Redundancy of Courage" (1991) were on the short list for the Booker Prize Britain's most prestigious fiction award."I think I may have got $:150000 or $:175000 if the book had gone to auction" Mr. Mo who in his early 40's told The Guardian. "But I perceived I was no longer seen as the bright young man. Nor was I yet a grand old man of literature. I wanted to take control. I am fed up relying on others."Mr. Burnham of Chatto said the parting with Mr. Mo went "amicably." "I think he's extremely brave and I'm very pleased for him that he's doing this" Mr. Burnham said. "It's a very tricky experiment. But he may well pull it off."Mr. Mo who was born in Hong Kong told The Guardian that if he sells 1000 hardback copies and 9000 trade paperbacks he should make a profit of about $:25000 or $39500. He may break even with about 3000 sales. "The money will flow to me" he said "rather than the publisher." What's OldFor penny-wise publishers nothing feels as good as getting to recycle old books with a link -- no matter how tenuous -- to current events.So it goes with Penguin and a 1972 book by F. Lee Bailey a lawyer for O. J. Simpson. The book "The Defense Never Rests" has no relation to the Simpson murder case other than two new lines on its jacket. The front cover reads: "O. J. Simpson's acclaimed defense attorney recreates his most famous wife-murder cases." The back cover notes that the cases described in the book "give us insight into why he is now one of the lead defense attorneys in 'The Trial of the Century': the O. J. Simpson trial." A New Name
 5928,  1982, a, No public issue carries more urgency for 71-year-old Edith Edelson than the immediate future of the Social Security system. She had spent most of Monday night thinking about it and she arose at 7 A.M. to type out her thoughts for a hearing today by the House Select Committee on Aging.Mrs. Edelson a former kindergarten teacher and a member of the Gray Panthers - a lobbying group for older Americans - said she wanted to make a well-reasoned and objective argument for her case. But it was not long after she had seated herself behind a microphone that she lost control.''I can remember in the days before Social Security hearing my mother say 'Please God not the poorhouse; let me have my own roof over my head' '' she said her voice weak and cracking. ''So my generation said we can't let this happen to us. We demanded Social Security.''It was the survival of that system and the fears and misconceptions about its financial health that the committee its witnesses and about 90 observers debated.

 2642,  2004, a, Best Buy said yesterday that it expected major suppliers to begin attaching radio identification tags to cartons and pallets of goods shipped to it starting Jan. 2 2006. It expects all such shipments from the suppliers to be tagged by May 2007. Best Buy a 750-store electronics and entertainment products chain based in Minneapolis said its radio identification system would use E.P.C. standards a form of the technology that Wal-Mart and the Department of Defense have already specified for suppliers. The company said it planned tests in stores and distribution centers before the introduction. Best Buy indicated that its short-term goals were to speed products through its supply chain and reduce instances of products that customers want being out of stock. But the company said it was also interested in the technology's potential to help with tasks like processing warranty claims and returns which would require leaving the radio tags on products when they are sold. That use of the technology is strongly opposed by consumer privacy advocates. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)
 14082,  1927, a, I have read the recent attacks on college fraternities by Rabbi Wise and James A. Farrell. For many years I have studied this problem of college life and the more I learn the better I am pleased with it as a whole. It is not perfect but nothing that is human is so far as I am aware. It has so many excellent qualities that outweigh its weaknesses as to make it well worth perpetuating. View Full Article in Timesmachine »

 4873,  1991, a, That display of harmony among political opponents who were trading recriminations only weeks ago was interrupted when a black nationalist faction the Pan-Africanist Congress walked out this afternoon. It wanted the convention held outside South Africa but that and its other proposals were rejected.Barney Desai head of the Pan-Africanist delegation said his group was suspending participation until it consulted its members some of whom are upset about the willingness of some of its leaders to negotiate.The Pan-Africanist Congress maintains that only Africans belong in South Africa. Guests From AbroadMr. Ramaphosa and Mr. Viljoen urged the few other parties that boycotted the preparatory talks to attend the December convention or find themselves marginalized politically. The right-wing Conservative Party which wants to preserve apartheid stayed away as did extremist groups like the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement.The Azanian People's Organization a black consciousness movement also rejected the invitation contending that participation was tantamount to collaboration with the Government.Guests from the United Nations the Organization of African Unity the Commonwealth and foreign embassies here will be invited and the sessions will be open to the press.The December convention is expected to open with speeches by Mr. de Klerk the African National Congress's leader Nelson Mandela and others and then to form working groups that will focus on aspects of the negotiating process. The African National Congress and other opponents of the Pretoria Government's will press demands for an interim administration and the election of an assembly to draft the new constitution both of which Mr. de Klerk opposes. Political ManeuveringThe realization that negotiations were at hand appeared to overcome ideological differences accounting for the show of tolerance with which the meeting ended today.
 1305,  2011, a, Simon Dawson/Bloomberg NewsAccel Partners has closed two new funds for China totaling $1.3 billion the company said on Friday.One fund valued at $550 million will focus on young start-ups while the second a $750 million fund will focus on later-stage financings. Accel which has been active in China since 2005 has made several investments in the region with its partner IDG.The closing of Accel’s funds comes as several of its large peers are raising billions in funding. As DealBook was first to report on Friday Bessemer Venture Partners raised $1.6 billion for a fund focused on early stage start-ups and India. The fund Bessemer’s largest to date was heavily oversubscribed with about $2.5 billion in intended commitments according to two people close to the firm who were not authorized to speak publicly.Jim Breyer a partner at Accel said the new funds represented Accel’s growing commitment to the market: “I spend several weeks each year in China with the team. We continue to remain very excited by the potential in China; its consumer Internet social applications mobile and media have remained our core focus over the last six years.”In 2010 Accel had nine exits in China including five initial public offerings Mr. Breyer said.

 4950,  1990, a, The Francis Bacon exhibition that opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art comprises 59 paintings. Most of them are large and some are made up of two or three canvases each measuring 78 by 58 inches. They cover the years from 1945 to 1988. (Bacon was 80 years old last October.) Many of the images in the show acquired classic status long ago and have been regarded by enthusiasts as central to the concerns of our day. This was already true when Bacon was believed as the critic Sam Hunter writes in the catalogue to have echoed the ''paralyzing affectless settings of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'No Exit' of 1942 and Samuel Beckett's 'Endgame' of 1957.'' And to this day in a sustained tracking shot that has been going for half a century Bacon seems to have prefigured many of the images that look out at us every day in the news pages and on the television news.We see men discarded like rotting meat. Behind what is presumably bulletproof glass we see other men preaching talking hallooing ranting raving or prey to manic uncontrollable laughter. (The primal human cry King Lear's ''Howl howl howl!'' is a lifelong obsession with Bacon though we should not forget what he said in 1962 to his friend the critic David Sylvester: that often as he had painted the primal cry he had always wanted to paint the primal smile but had never succeeded in doing it.) In the Bacons that everyone talks about we see violence taken for granted and the bloodied messes that result from it. Voyeur and victim are set before us in ways that suggest they may soon change places. Second-rank and second-rate people stand around just as they do in life to see what will come of it all.In the windowless echo chamber that Bacon knew so well how to evoke (as in ''Study for a Portrait'' 1953) we see an archetypal C.E.O. revert to babyhood in his single hotel room. We see prefigured the hideous ordinariness of Adolf Eichmann on trial in Jerusalem. Bacon could also (as in ''Fragment for a Crucifixion'' from 1950) give a new and sinister meaning to the phrase ''dog eat dog.''These are one-shot images and most of them date from 40 years ago but they still pack a formidable punch. Those who have grown up and grown old with them would have trouble imagining a world in which they had played no part. They are by now a permanent part of the furniture of the European imagination and the paintings as we see them in the Museum of Modern Art come over again and again as grand formal statements in which order and clarity have long ago won out over disquiet.

The National Weather Service said about a half‐inch of rain fell in New York City. most of in the first hour and temperatures dropped sharply from the mid‐SO's to the low 70's.There were numerous scattered problems for public utilities. High winds and pounding rains felled tree limbs that severed overhead power lines in Staten Island and Westchester and Rockland Counties. Lightning strikes were blamed for other power failures and short circuits on transmission lines were said to have led to other blackouts.Rockland County was the hardest hit. A total of 5700 customers of the Orange and Rockland Utilities principally in Haverstraw Tappan Mount Ivy Suffern and Pomona were left without power for periods ranging up to two hours. Some of the utility's customers in Bergen County in northern New Jersey also were affected.

Grosso said Dr. Jascalevich was pressing lightly on the patient's chest with the tips of his fingers “which I thought was quite unusual.” He testified that the patient was blue and motionless and that he went to the patient's bedside and offered to help but got no response from Dr. Jascalevich.“He just walked away and left the room” Dr. Grosso testified.The patient was Emma M. Arzt who died later that day and is one of the five patients Dr. Jascalevich is accused Of murdering at the hospital in Oradell in 1965 and 1966 by secretly giving them lethal doses of the drug curare.Dr. Jascalevich is charged with killing the patients of other doctors to discredit colleagues who he thought were challenging his authority. The defense contends Dr. Jascalevich was framed with the curare charges by inept doctors seeking an explanation for the sudden deaths at the hospital that were the result of their own mistakes.

 3296,  2000, a, The audience and the temperature had fallen precipitously since their last meeting but the United States and China played another riveting match in women's soccer early yesterday morning in Canberra Australia. Again the match was decided by penalty kicks. This time however China prevailed.Four minutes from the end of regulation the Chinese forward Sun Wen got tangled with defender Danielle Slaton and the two fell down in the penalty area. China was awarded a penalty kick and Sun calmly placed her shot in the upper right corner for a 1-0 victory.The last time these teams played July 10 1999 they drew the largest audience ever to watch a women's sporting event -- 90185 at the Rose Bowl for the final of the Women's World Cup. This match held in the first round of the Pacific Cup tournament was played before an estimated 550 fans. And those summer temperatures that had risen above 100 degrees on the Rose Bowl turf had dipped to freezing in the Southern Hemisphere's late autumn. JERE LONGMAN

 4148,  1995, a, Only a clutch play by shortstop Tony Fernandez kept the Royals from scoring more in the inning. With the bases loaded and one out second baseman Joe Randa hit a hard grounder up the middle that Kamieniecki deflected with his bare hand. The ball rolled to second base where Fernandez snared it stepped on the bag and fired to first for an inning-ending double play. Still the Yankees trailed for the first time this season 4-1.They closed the deficit to 4-3 when Fernandez and Velarde scored unearned runs in the fifth but the Royals got to Kamieniecki again in their half of the inning. When Hamelin singled up the middle with one out Showalter summoned right-hander Scott Bankhead for his first appearance as a Yankee."I had no command of anything" Kamieniecki said. "I was pitching from behind and they made me pay today. It seemed like whatever I tried didn't work out." He said Showalter "stuck with me a lot longer than I thought he would."Bankhead acquired in an Aug. 31 trade from the Red Sox fared no better than Kamieniecki. He lasted only a third of an inning as the Royals greeted him with three consecutive hits. Gaetti belted a two-run homer over the left-field wall to make the score 6-3. Gagne then singled to right and went to third on Michael Tucker's liner to right.The Royals then pulled off a double steal that the Yankees botched defensively with a bad throw from second base by Velarde who was making his first start of the season.As Tucker broke for second Velarde cut off the throw from Stanley and seemed to have plenty of time to gun down Gagne who was racing home. But Velarde's throw went in the dirt and past Stanley allowing Gagne to score and Tucker to move to third on the error. Tucker then increased the lead to 8-3 scoring on a double by Brent Mayne. That was all for Bankhead who allowed three runs and four hits before being relieved by left-hander Andy Pettitte.The Royals made it 9-3 in the sixth when Wally Joyner doubled off Pettitte and scored when Mattingly mishandled a ground ball by Gaetti with two outs. Gaetti's grounder came off Brian Boehringer who made his major league debut replacing Pettitte with two outs in the sixth. Right-hander Jeff Patterson made his first major league appearance by pitching in the eighth for the Yankees walking three but not allowing a run."It's a continuation of spring training for some of these guys" Showalter said. "They're all going to get better especially Bankhead. He's better than that."

 1196,  2012, a, Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesTHURSDAY’S PUZZLE — I did it! I figured out that a puzzle was a rebus all by my lonesome!That’s almost as exciting as the first time I solved a Saturday puzzle on my own. You never forget your first time do you?Not only that but I really liked this game-themed puzzle by Xan Vongsathorn. I must have played at least one bajillion and eleventy-two games of DUCK DUCK GOOSE with my kids — a game that definitely got a lot more fun once I’d had more than one kid — and they never ever not once tired of it even when I begged them to please guys in the name of all that is holy give me a break. So I spent a lot of their young childhood running in circles.Anyway you will pat five DUCKs on the head (10 if you count the crossings) before you reach the GOOSE at 68 Across. I liked SITTING DUCK and the mouthwatering PEKING DUCK and who doesn’t love an appearance by DAISY DUCK?Once I got the “rebus gist” a new phrase that I am coining to celebrate my victory and define the point of the rebus in the puzzle it was pretty fast going and in fact I found myself racing to the bottom of the grid to catch my GOOSE. Were you aware of speeding up at all?Some of the longer entries are very cool too. I liked ICE SKATE ON THE DOT and PLEATHER which is not only an inexpensive couch covering as the clue suggests but is also a vegetarian option for those who don’t wear leather.Thanks for the game Mr. Vongsathorn. Next time let’s play Tag.You’ll have to watch almost all of this clip to see Chuck Berry DUCKWALK but it’s worth it. If your soul keeps singing the blues then you will be DUCKWALKing too.Your thoughts?

 5857,  1984, a, The Consolidated Foods Corporation said today that shareholders of Nicholas Kiwi Ltd. had approved a Consolidated Foods offer to buy a major share of Kiwi for $330 million.Since its first offer of $250 million for 75 percent of Kiwi on Oct. 2 Consolidated Foods had been locked in a bidding war for Kiwi with Reckitt & Colman P.L.C. a major British household products company.Kiwi is an Australian maker of household shoe and personal-care products.John H. Bryan Jr. chairman and chief executive of Consolidated Foods which is based in Chicago said in a telephone interview from Melbourne Australia that shareholders apparently were swayed by the offer of cash plus stock in ''the new Nicholas Kiwi Australia.''Under the agreement Consolidated would acquire all of Kiwi's non-Australian operations which account for about 80 percent of the company's sales. It would also own 15 percent of Kiwi's Australian operations. Mr. Bryan said that Kiwi's current management would continue to supervise its worldwide operations.

 2179,  2006, a, Not long after the owners of the infamous Watergate Hotel announce its condo conversion two reports come out that say the Washington area has too many condos already.The poor building–site of the break-in that brought down Richard Nixon once the home of Monica Lewinsky and designed by Luigi Moretti the Italian architect who became a fascist and prospered under Benito Mussolini–just can’t catch a break.MetroStudy’s Kenneth Wenhold director of the company’s Virginia-Maryland division predicted in an interview that so many condos are under construction or planned particularly in Arlington and Fairfax counties that “there is a very significant problem” of overbuilding and the potential for projects to go bust.But as must be required by some super-secret real estate industry pact there is the caveat that things don’t look that bad:But the report concludes that the expectations of continued strong job growth strong housing demand and low interest rates plus the relative lack of affordability of other kinds of housing will keep condo sales from crashing in most markets including in the Washington area. “We are likely to experience a soft landing in most major metro markets but less gentle in others” the Delta report found. Cities with the greatest risk of a hard landing — those with a lot of condo production and conversion high levels of speculator activity and modest levels of job growth — are Las Vegas Miami and Phoenix the report said.The reports come from MetroStudy a Houston-based market research firm and Delta Associates an Alexandria-based affiliate of Transwestern Co. — DAMON DARLIN

 5196,  1989, a, A New York State advisory panel proposed major new programs yesterday to deal with the rising epidemic of AIDS among prison inmates and health and prison officials endorsed the proposals as a strong plan for action.Prisons could become a ''charnel house'' of inmates ''consigned to a tragic and hastened death'' unless such steps are taken the panel warned.Among the recommendations in its report are the creation of two AIDS wards to be run by private hospitals expansion of nursing-home care for inmates humane early release from prison for dying inmates encouragement of testing with privacy protections early medical intervention for those infected but not yet sick access to experimental drugs treatment for drug addiction and support groups and counseling for prison staff members inmates and their families.One state official who requested anonymity estimated that the expanded health services could cost $70 million a year.
 3572,  1998, a, The commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf region said today that the American military buildup in the area had in all likelihood thwarted the threat of hostilities by Iraq but warned that a military confrontation remained a possibility.Addressing American troops here the commander Gen. Anthony C. Zinni said that he did not yet know when the United States would be able to withdraw additional forces sent to the region last month during the most recent showdown with Iraq.''The biggest question is where are we on the crisis and how long are we here'' he said to the troops. ''I will tell you we are not out of the woods on the crisis even though things have leveled off a little bit.''General Zinni a stocky blunt-spoken marine is the commander in chief of the United States Central Command in Tampa Fla. the position held during the Persian Gulf war by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. General Zinni's remarks came as he completed a brief holiday visit to troops in the region which also included stops at American bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
 4437,  1993, a, Last Friday Glenn Ganey lived his nightmare. "I was working at a desk when the explosion hit" recounted Mr. Ganey who works in Dean Witter's data processing department. "Like everyone else we didn't know what to do since communications were knocked out and there was no guidance." It took 90 minutes for Mr. Ganey to make it down from the 67th floor.Mental health professionals who have already started to provide post-disaster counseling worry about how long it will take people like Mr. Ganey and thousands like him to recover from the trauma of the explosion.The American Red Cross and other agencies met over the weekend to develop a plan to make counseling available for the thousands of workers who were trapped and made their way to safety. The New York office of the Red Cross is coordinating efforts by several agencies to help workers at the World Trade Center cope with the psychological aftermath."We are aware of the trauma people have experienced and their concerns" said Melvin Reeves director of disaster services at the Red Cross.
 1900,  2008, a, For Beijing 1949 was a big year. That’s when the People’s Republic was founded right here in the capital. It was also the year that the Beijing Machinery and Electric Institute opened a factory in the Sanlitun neighborhood. Nearly 60 years later that long-idle industrial ruin has become the centerpiece of one of the most unusual drinking and dining complexes in town. 1949-The Hidden City opened a few weeks ago and it’s drawing praise from diners architecture fans preservationists and my out-of-town visitors who get dragged there whether they want to or not.1949 was developed by Elite Concepts a Hong Kong company that operates restaurants there and in Shanghai Jakarta and Macau. The complex consists of nearly a dozen inter-connected buildings in a 55000-square-foot walled village. About half of that is covered with trees and grass making it an oasis of urban calm. Open so far are a Chinese restaurant a European restaurant a noodle bar a coffee-and-drinks bar and an art gallery. The original factory has been preserved and the same warm hue of red brick used to construct the other buildings. Interiors are brightened by extensive use of glass and wood.Food’s not bad either. Duck de Chine the Chinese restaurant offers a tasty wood-fired version of the iconic local specialty Peking duck for 188 yuan (about $27 at the current exchange rate of 6.9 yuan to the dollar). Its arrival is signaled by a gong and the bird is carved at your table. Good for impressing visitors. The menu includes duck several other ways but for variety’s sake you might want to try the many pork beef and noodle dishes. Oddly the restaurant has a marketing arrangement with Bollinger whose famous bubbly is the featured wine offering. Not the perfect accompaniment for duck perhaps but there is also a high-quality selection of reds and whites at typically elevated Beijing prices. Tip: the Ste. Michelle Riesling from Washington State one of the cheapest on the list at 345 yuan goes well with many Chinese dishes.The European restaurant 1/5 taverna has a cosmopolitan vaguely Spanish-tinged menu heavy on steaks seafood and pasta. One notable offering is the roast baby lamb from Mongolia (458 yuan for a shoulder 488 for a leg) which will feed six people. We had the leg with a Calina Reserva Carmenere a sturdy Chilean red for 388 yuan a bottle.The Noodle Bar seats only 12 people around a wooden oval and offers hand-pulled noodle dishes. The airy glass-enclosed Sugar Bar specializes in coffee concoctions but also has a full range of mixed drinks beers and wines. A more ambitious bar 1/5 is set to open any minute. So is the Well Bar a circular outdoor counter built atop an old fire-fighting well.1949-The Hidden City is so new that few taxi drivers know it. But the complex lies behind Pacific Century Place a glitz-bathed commercial and residential complex on Gong Ti Bei Lu between Sanlitun Nan Lu and the Third Ring Road. Better hurry: 1949 may not stay hidden for long.

 2473,  2005, a, NEW BRUNSWICK N.J. Sept. 29 - Neeme Jarvi seems pleased with himself but in a generous sort of way that invites those around him to be pleased as well. At once warm engaging and phlegmatic on the conductor's podium he seems a bit of a showoff but one who won't be really happy unless you enjoy the experience as much as he does.You could say he works the room; he certainly works the orchestra lavishing attention on the first violins flicking the flutes into line with a finger.All of this set a good tone on Thursday evening at his first official concert as music director of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra here at the State Theater.The orchestra is certainly pleased with itself. Mr. Jarvi a renowned and extensively recorded conductor represents quite a catch for an institution accustomed to being overshadowed by the New York music scene. And after a difficult period chiefly noted in the press for the to-do about a set of rare but evidently overvalued string instruments that it acquired from the collector Herbert Axelrod since indicted for tax evasion the orchestra is eager to turn over a new leaf. "New Leader New Sound New Era" trumpets a slogan on the front of the program with a picture of Mr. Jarvi looking particularly cuddly.

 660,  2015, a, PhotoSUNDAY PUZZLE — A very literal puzzle today from Matt Ginsberg where the circled squares do exactly what the entire phrase describes.

I won’t spoil all the fun for you. Just remember to do what the base phrase tells you to do and you will be just fine.Clue of the Day for me was “Something to pay through?” which totally made the partial THE NOSE better.Let’s hear from Mr. Ginsberg:Constructor’s Notes:It’s always interesting to see what happens to my puzzles between submission and appearance. On this puzzle I clued all the horizontal words with circles as — SMALL SPOILER ALERT — simply [See circled letters]. But Will decided to make it a bit easier. I’m not sure who was right; my clue was used in a similar “Kangaroo words” puzzle in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament one year although that puzzle was somewhat more straightforward cluing for example “israELi AirLine” as [See circled letters]. So this would have been a bit trickier. I thought of the theme itself while sitting in church one Sunday. I spent the rest of the service trying to think of examples to use. This was good because I stayed awake but bad because I didn’t pay attention to the sermon. There was no test afterward so it all worked out O.K.. Meanwhile I seem to be losing my touch a bit on the cluing side as many of the clues that I thought were clever or topical didn’t make the editorial cut. I used [Seahawks’ star Marshawn] for 21-Down and [Berry repeatedly] for 44-Down. I used [Disney actor] for 67-Down in light of the (fairly) recent film. Perhaps I am simply too old to recognize topical when I see it. (I must confess that I transitioned from one A.C.P.T. age division to another a couple of weeks ago.) Not that I will ever compete of course. And Dr.Fill remains comfortably in the “Juniors” bracket. If you want to see Dr.Fill solving today’s puzzle here it is. I apologize for all the video flashing and whatnot; it’s courtesy of my Mac’s upgrade to Yosemite. I’ll try and track it down before the next tournament. Not surprisingly Dr.Fill does pretty well on this puzzle since all of the fill consists of actual words or phrases. It makes a few mistakes early on but it has no trouble correcting them. The solution is found in well under a minute but it then spends bit of time checking its work and looking for a theme or rebus possibility before announcing that it is done. Correctly solved in a bit under two minutes. I hope everyone enjoyed the puzzle!Let’s say THANK U to Mr. Ginsberg and move on to the Monday puzzle.Your thoughts?

 4248,  1995, a, With a .250 winning percentage the Islanders came into tonight's game with the 25th-best record in the 26-team National Hockey League. At .295 the Ottawa Senators were ranked No. 23.In a game worthy of both teams and both records before 8167 enablers the Islanders survived a late Senator surge and escaped with a 5-3 victory.The crowd in a building that seats 10575 was the smallest home gathering in the four-year history of the Senators but none of the Islanders seemed to mind. They probably would have been happy to stay and play them again and again. The Senators have not won in their last 12 games and only 1 of them was a tie.When Coach Mike Milbury was asked to discuss the Islanders' next game which will be Saturday against the Devils Milbury replied: "No. We don't have too many to enjoy. Even though we had to hang on at the end it was good."

 5359,  1988, a, Mr. Salinas will be sworn in at the Mexican Congress where in August and September enraged opposition legislators sought to prevent his certification as the country's President-elect. After nearly a month of heated debates and occasional fistfights however Mr. Salinas's victory in the July 6 balloting with a bare majority of 50.7 percent of the vote was made official.Opposition parties of the right and left continue to maintain that they were deprived of millions of votes and that Mr. Salinas is coming to office illegitimately. But negotiations aimed at preventing incidents during the inauguration ceremonies ended with both opposition blocs being permitted to state their positions before Mr. Salinas enters the legislative chamber.New doubts about Mr. Salinas's commitment to political change were raised this afternoon when Fernando Gutierrez Barrios Governor of the state of Veracruz was named Secretary of the Interior. That post whose responsibilities include supervision of the state police and security apparatus is the most politically influential and sensitive in the Cabinet. Mr. Gutierrez Barrios 61 headed the federal police in 1968 when army and security forces fired on student protestors here killing more than 250 people and he continues to be regarded as a hard-liner with no particular devotion to civil liberties. Minister Stays in CabinetIn a break with tradition Mr. Salinas retained Manuel Bartlett Diaz the current Interior Minister and his chief rival last year for the ruling party's presidential nomination in the Cabinet this time as Education Minister. Opposition leaders accused Mr. Bartlett of engineering the electoral fraud they say took place in July and the choice is likely to be as controversial as that of Mr. Guitierrez Barrios.As Foreign Minister Mr. Salinas chose Fernando Solana who is currently director of the Banco Nacional de Mexico and who has served previously as both Education and Commerce Ministers. Though the post of ambassador to Washington is not yet filled advisers to Mr. Salinas said the choice of Gustavo Petricioli the current Finance Minister was probable.

 2414,  2005, a, So Adrienne von Lates the museum's curator of education and Ms. Hernandez put together a curriculum of four two-hour workshops that could easily be offered at each center. To date the program has served some 400 girls.Appearing scarcely older than a teenager herself Ms. Hernandez 25 is quick to establish a rapport with each group a relationship somewhere between mentor and big sister. The first hour is like a college-level art history class: she gives an overview of the artists being discussed shows slides and opens the room to discussion. The language in the reading material on the artists is sophisticated; as the girls read it aloud and Ms. Hernandez reviews any words or ideas that are difficult."A lot of these girls suffer from low expectations" she said. "I really come at them expecting a lot and very often they will meet me at that level."In the second hour the teenagers work on an art project inspired by an artist they have just studied and that usually involves photography or collage. At the Village one of the Lorna Simpson pieces "Stereo Styles" (1988) consisted of 10 photographs of African-American women depicted from behind in identical dress with only the hair styled differently. Running along the bottom of the serially mounted photos was the text: "Daring Sensible Severe Long & Silky Boyish Ageless Silly Magnetic Country Fresh Sweet."The girls then each found a partner so they could photograph each other's hair from behind. "It's this idea of what hair says about you" Ms. Hernandez told the girls many of whom had been playing with each other's hair before the workshop began and greeted the project with enthusiasm.One girl was concerned that her hair fell under the "boyish" category. "I think Lorna Simpson's talking about labels and I think she's criticizing those labels" Ms. Hernandez said. Another chose to focus on the wildly curly tips of her subject's brown hair; another zoomed in so closely on a bun it seemed abstract.A popular art project in the program is based on a series of collages in which the Kenya-born artist Wangechi Mutu cobbled together pieces of advertisements from beauty magazines and assembled them to create disfigured women as a way of questioning cultural ideals of perfection.

 1159,  2012, a, Jeff Haynes/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOTTAWA — The Canadian government will allow Conrad Black the former publisher to return to the land of his birth when he finishes serving his sentence for fraud and obstruction of justice in a Florida jail The Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday.Mr. Black gave up his Canadian citizenship in 2001 to accept a British peerage. His criminal conviction which came in Chicago in 2007 meant that under Canadian immigration law he was unable to return to his Toronto home after his release from the American penal system which may take place this weekend.But the newspaper said that Mr. Black had been granted a special permit that will allow him to enter Canada and remain for one year. His plans after that are unclear although last August he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation he might try to regain his Canadian citizenship.Immigration Minister Jason Kenney a Conservative said that he avoided any involvement in Mr. Black’s case and that the permit was handled by public servants. Mr. Kenney said that the government granted about 10000 temporary permits a year many of them going to people with criminal convictions.But Thomas Mulcair leader of the opposition New Democratic Party insisted in the House of Commons that “the British criminal Conrad Black” who strongly backed the Conservatives when he owned a Canadian newspaper chain received special treatment because several people who had served much shorter sentences in American prisons for nonviolent offenses had been denied permits.“There’s obviously one set of standards for Conservative Party insiders and another that applies to everyone else” he said.

 3018,  2002, a, While much of the area around the school looked relatively unscathed the school itself was reduced to dusty debris and flattened to a fraction of its former size. It looked as if something colossal had crashed down upon it.Even hours after they began sifting through the debris rescue workers seemed transfixed by the sight of it and unable to come to terms with what lay beneath it.One firefighter who stood a few yards from the school taking a short break whispered into a cellphone: ''They are children. They are children. They are dead children.''Ambulances waited along the streets and endless phalanxes of police officers their hands linked formed human chains to keep the streets clear for emergency traffic.At about 9:15 P.M. the rescue workers suddenly accelerated their pace and minutes later several of them rushed to a stretcher with a wriggling boy who residents said was 6 or 7.As they laid him on a stretcher and wheeled it to an ambulance Giuseppe Colombo the school's principal who had been pacing up and down the street with a frantic look on his face reached out his hand and brushed the boy's cheek with it.''How are you?'' he said. ''How are you? They tell me you're going to be fine.''Mr. Colombo carried a list of all the children who had been at school that day so he could keep track of who had been found and who had not.
 5835,  1984, a, It was not certain why Mr. Buscetta decided to do so but the police speculated that he might have been seeking revenge on other crime leaders for murders of several of his relatives and chief lieutenants.Mr. Buscetta tried to commit suicide after he was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on charges of having a false passport. He was extradited here on July 15 and has been held in two maximum security prisons.The raids began early Saturday and for several hours the police sealed off Palermo the Sicilian capital. Officials said 3000 police officers were involved in the operation. The arrests were concentrated in Palermo and Rome but extended to other Italian cities.As they were taken into police stations around the country this weekend some of the accused smiled or laughed and nodded confidently to reporters. But others hung their heads or hid their faces from photographers. Premature News of RaidsThe exact number of arrests was uncertain today and the Italian police were reported to be upset that word of the raids was given to the press before they were completed. Officials said some of those named in the warrants might have escaped before the police arrived.Late this afternoon the Italian news agency ANSA reported that 58 people had been arrested while other officials said the number had reached 69. Those arrested were taken to prisons around the country mainly in the north the police said.Among the people picked up in the raids according to the police was Vito Ciancimino the former Christian Democratic Mayor of Palermo.

 1680,  2009, a, After taking a tongue lashing from President Obama Chrysler’s holdout lenders got a show of support from The Financial Times’s John Gapper.“Unlike Barack Obama and others I have sympathy for the hedge funds and other investment funds that rejected the Chrysler restructuring offer and forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy” Mr. Gapper wrote in a column titled “In defence of the Chrysler hedge funds.”On Thursday Mr. Obama railed against the holdout lenders now effectively a hostile group of business partners whom he called “speculators.”“They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrifices and they would have to make none” Mr. Obama said of the creditors among them several hedge funds and boutique investment funds. “I don’t stand with them.”Most of the major debtholders led by JPMorgan Chase agreed to write down the debt owed to them by more than two-thirds. That put the onus on the remaining holdouts — including units of OppenheimerFunds Xerion Capital Fund of Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital — which argued they were falling victim to the willingness of their big banking partners in Chrysler to play nice with a government that had helped bail them out as well. Perella Weinberg decided late Thursday that it would accept the government’s terms.Administration officials said the holdouts’ position left them no option but to force Chrysler into bankruptcy.“Well yes” Mr. Gapper wrote “except that some of these ‘speculators’ inconveniently manage money on behalf of pension plans and endowments rather than rapacious rich people. They have a fiduciary duty to get the best deal they can on behalf of their investors.”“I also take seriously their point that although they are higher up in the ranks of creditors than Chrysler’s unions notably the UAW they were offered less for their investments” Mr. Gapper added.The secured lenders contending that they are being unfairly blamed for sending the automaker into bankruptcy protection say that the Obama administration is skirting bankruptcy law by forcing them to take a larger loss on their debt than other Chrysler stakeholders.The group which is calling itself the Committee of Non-TARP Lenders said Thursday that it had been compelled to negotiate through a group of big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that have accepted government bailout money and so are reluctant to push back against the Treasury Department’s proposal. They claim the government has ignored their proposals to restructure Chrysler.Mr. Gapper agreed with that assessment writing: “President Obama is trying to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to shove these investors into taking a worse deal than they could ordinarily expect under Chapter 11. The Tarp-funded banks that voted for the deal were no doubt aware of how they might be pilloried if they did not do so.”However not all industry watchers were feeling the love for the holdout lenders. The Washington Post’s Steven Pearlstein took them to task in a broad swipe at the hedge fund industry.“There may be nothing more pathetic than a hedge-fund manager worked up in a moral lather complaining that he hasn’t been treated fairly. Since when did any of these guys ever worry about fairness?” Mr. Pearlstein wrote.The columnist said he didn’t “recall receiving even a single e-mail from a hedge-fund manager complaining about how unfair it was that the government stepped in to bail out creditors and counterparties of Citigroup Bear Stearns and AIG.”In an editorial on the Chrysler bankruptcy The New York Times said that by pushing the matter into bankruptcy court the administration was assuming that the judge would also reject the holdouts’ demands.“There are reasons to hope it will work out that way. In particular a judge may be unwilling to favor the dissident bondholders when other significant stakeholders have been able to come to agreement outside of court” The New York Times said.Bankruptcy always contains some element of unpredictability and the minority of debtholders who oppose the new arrangement could argue in court that the company is worth more to them in liquidation. Mr. Gapper argued that the holdout creditors may even “have a better chance of getting improved terms from the bankruptcy court than the US administration would have us believe.”Go to Article from The Financial Times »Go to Article from The Washington Post »Go to Item from DealBook »Go to Editorial from The New York Times »Go to Related Article from The New York Times »

 1287,  2011, a, The N.F.L. and its players have been throwing verbal barbs at each other in recent weeks as they try to work out a new labor agreement. The players union though appears to have lost at least one megaphone.CBS College Sports Network has refused to air a commercial produced by the N.F.L. Players Association for Saturday’s Texas-America All-Star game which is sponsored by the union.As part of their nearly year-old agreement with the hosts of the event and College Sports Network the union says it was promised two minutes of free air time with no content restrictions.So it produced a 30-second and a one-minute commercial the first cuts of which were given to the network in mid-January according to George Atallah a spokesman for the players union. He added that the network rejected them late last week saying that it did not want to get in the middle of the dispute over the collective bargaining agreement.The one-minute version of the commercial clearly flouts the union’s agenda. It features scenes of empty stadiums locker rooms and gyms and fans and players saying “let them play” and “let us play” and an allusion to the threat of a lockout by the N.F.L. owners if a new labor deal is not reached by March 3.At the end of the commercial the screen reads “Do Your Part to Let Us Play. Sign the petition at www.nfllockout.com//www.nfllockout.com/.”“It’s unfortunate they seem to be scared off” Atallah said of the network. “I hope this puts the spotlight on the college all-star game and the players who might be locked out.”Dana McClintock a spokesman for CBS College Sports Network confirmed that the network did not want to take sides in the labor dispute and that it wouldn’t run a similar ad from N.F.L. either. CBS is one of four networks that pays the N.F.L. $4 billion to broadcast their games.Addressing suspicions that the network balked so as not to offend the league Greg Aiello a spokesman for the N.F.L. said the league did not know about the network’s decision and had no objection to anyone running the ad.
 3336,  2000, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students explore the popular culture phenomenon of the musical ‘Cats’ and the T.S. Eliot poems that were its inspiration. Students then write original poems about animals and read them aloud to their peers.Author(s):Katherine Schulten The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Listen to a reading of one of the poems in T.S. Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” and respond by drawing their impressions.2. Examine the popularity of the musical “Cats” through reading and discussing “The Last Meow: A Fence Sitter’s Summing Up.”3. Brainstorm and write a rough draft of their own animal poems then meet in small peer groups to read them aloud.4. Conduct further research on their animal and use new information to shape a second draft of the poem.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-classroom blackboard-paper-copies of “The Last Meow: A Fence Sitter’s Summing Up” (one per student)-copies of at least one poem from Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” (these can be obtained at //www.kirtland.cc.mi.us/honors/possums.htm)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Read aloud one of the poems in “Old Possum’s Book ofPractical Cats” as the class listens. Ask students to respond in their journals by drawing something that relates to or is inspired by what they have heard. Volunteers then share their drawings and talk about the aspects of the poem they tried to capture. Ask students what they know about the musical “Cats” and its connection to T.S. Eliot’s poetry.2. As a class read and discuss “The Last Meow: A Fence Sitter’s Summing Up” focusing on the following questions:a. What is the tone of the opening paragraph of this piece? What does it lead you to expect from the rest of the review? How would you describe the overall tone of the article? Find lines that reveal the tone of the article especially well.b. Why does this reviewer feel it may be unnecessary to see popular culture phenomena like “Cats”? Do you agree? Why or why not?c. What complaints about the musical does this critic list? Why do you think “Cats” has “never been a critic’s show”?d. What aspects of the show does the reviewer praise? How does the show “seduce the audience”?e. How did “Cats” originally “set the standard” for the shows that transformed Broadway in the 1980’s? How has it evolved to “milk its shtick”?f. How is there “democracy” in the “Cats” phenomenon?g. What finally is the reviewer’s feeling about the value of “Cats”? Is the style and voice in which the article is written an effective way to convey this? Why or why not?3. Have students each choose an animal on which to do some freewriting and brainstorming in their journals. Tell them that they may choose a specific animal they have known such as a pet or a kind of animal in general. Guide students in ten minutes of freewriting by asking them to write down everything they can think of about this animal. What does it look like? How does it move? What are its habits? What when where and how does it eat sleep and play? What does it smell like? What does it feel like? What sounds does it make? When students have finished ask them to look over their freewriting and underline those words or images that seem especially evocative of this animal. Now have them try crafting their thoughts into a poem of some sort whether a simple list of images or a lengthy rhyming story like those in the “Old Possum” poems. After writing students might meet in small peer groups to hear and respond to these first drafts. Before the class ends the teacher might read “The Naming of Cats is a Difficult Matter” and ask students to consider what name their animal and/or poem should have.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students research the animal they have chosen in some way (through observation of an actual animal through interviewing someone who knows about this kind of animal or through library or internet research). Students then incorporate new information into a second draft of their poem. Poems can be read in a class read-around the following day or posted on a school bulletin board.Further Questions for Discussion:–What is the job of a reviewer? How have reviews influenced you in the past?–What other popular culture phenomena can you identify? Why do you think these things were so popular?–Are there any pop culture phenomena that you have ignored? If so how much did you know about it anyway simply because it “saturated” our culture?–Have you ever been to the theater? How did you find the experience?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on their drawn responses to the Eliot poem their participation in class and small group discussions and the creation of first and final drafts of their own animal poems.Vocabulary:elitism saturate rudimentary treacly duress nominal unassailable disavowed fodder chagrin paradigm fortuitous progenitors cogent flaccid obfuscating anthropomorphisms paean shmaltz obviating detritus proverbial attenuate palliated stultifyingExtension Activities:1. Adapt a favorite poem story play novel or other literary work for use in the musical theater. A poem or short story might be adapted as a song while a novel or longer work might be recast as an entire Broadway musical. Look to famous adaptations–such as “Romeo and Juliet” as transformed into “West Side Story”– for inspiration.2. What should theaters do to attract people your age and cultivate in them a lifelong love of theater? Create an ad campaign that would either convince your peers to visit the theater in general or would attract them to some specific theatrical event in your school community or city.3. What current popular culture craze that exists among your peers do you believe adults do not really understand? Write an editorial for your local paper in which you explain why this show hobby series game toy or other phenomenon is so popular and make a case for why it should be encouraged.4. Collect a series of simple poems by different authors on the same subject-whether animals or anything else-and find or draw illustrations for each poem. Write an introduction to your “book” and donate it to an elementary school library or classroom.5. How would T.S. Eliot himself respond to the phenomenon that is the musical “Cats”? Research to learn about T.S. Eliot then write an imaginary interview in which he speaks his mind.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research the history of theater in America to identify the most popular shows of the 20th century. Then create a timeline that names these shows lists one or two other major national or world events from the same time and provide a sentence or two of explanation as to why these shows were so popular.Fine Arts- Research film and theater history to learn about the art of turning human actors into animals through costuming. Then design your own costume that would transform you into an animal of some kind.Journalism- Compare and contrast this review with one of the original reviews of “Cats” that appeared in the early 1980s the era in which it was “a hip had-to-be-there ticket.” What does it tell you about how times and tastes change?Mathematics- This review lists many odd facts about the show such as “maintenance workers have removed 237 pounds of gum from Winter Garden seat bottoms.” Compile a series of odd or “goofy” statistics to document something long-running in your community. You might choose your school as a topic (How many plates of macaroni and cheese can you estimate have been served in your cafeteria? How many detentions given?) a local business or even your own family.Other Information on the Web:“Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” (sums.htm”>//www.kirtland.cc.mi.us/honors/possums.htm) is the T.S. Eliot collection of poems from which the musical “Cats” arose.Etcetera’s World of Cats (//tantomille.tripod.com/ewc.html) is a fan site with “Cats” history photos games news and more.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Language Arts Standard 1- Demonstrates competence in the general skills and strategies of the writing process.

 3843,  1997, a, The Energy Department said today that it planned to carry out the first in a series of nuclear weapons experiments intended to assure the safety of the United States' aging nuclear arsenal. Department officials said the tests would not violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.Some environmental and arms-control organizations have tried to stop the tests which begin Wednesday arguing that they are inconsistent with a post-cold-war policy of reducing the nuclear arms threat. But the Government maintains that the tests in which scientists at the Nevada Test Site will set off high-powered explosives to measure their effect on plutonium are needed to learn how to assure the reliability of aging nuclear weapons by some means other than blowing them up. The experiments are allowed the department argues because no nuclear reaction will occur.The experiments ''are essential to the United States' commitment to a world free of nuclear testing while maintaining a reliable nuclear deterrent'' the department said.But six prominent arms-control experts released a letter today to the White House the Energy Department and the Pentagon asking for international inspections to demonstrate that the tests were non-nuclear.
 6169,  1976, a, WASHINGTON March 1—The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether appeals court judges who are reviewing obscenity convictions must themselves look at the alleged]y obscene materials before they rule.The Court took up the question at the behest of three individuals and two corporations convicted in the United States District Court in Kentucky of transporting in interstate commerce a series of “obscene lewd lascivious and filthy films and film previews” including “Deep Throat.”The defendants first appealed their convictions to the United States Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit but that court by vote of 2 to 1 upheld the lower court without loking at any of the movies.The films were all “lodged with the court as exhibits” the one dissenting judge noted in his opinion but he said “the majority of the panel decided that an examination of them was not necessary.”

 2816,  2003, a, Members of Congress return this week newly educated about their constituents' growing doubts about the cost of the Iraq occupation the health of the economy and the homeland's preparedness for disaster whether by grid failure or terrorist plot. The troubling budget deficits so eagerly engineered by President Bush and his Republican majority have only worsened during the vacation. The G.O.P. leaders face a difficult agenda and there are already more signs of fresh procrastination than of resolve. A prime example is the leaders' unwillingness to break out the problem of the Northeast power grid's failure into an emergency measure free of the pork-laden energy bill.If Congress learned anything this summer it should be the need to become a driving force in demanding a far more candid and thoughtful Iraq reconstruction plan from the administration. The House was able to muster some independence when it came to demanding the import of lower-price prescription drugs and overruling parts of the Federal Communications Commission plan to allow big media companies to own more TV stations. We would like to see more of that kind of spirit but it seems more likely that the majority will continue to move in lock step as it did when members cruelly blocked working-poor families from the new Bush child-credit tax break other Americans enjoy. The president has so far failed to deliver on his vow to fight for the poor but the opportunity is at hand if he dare resist his House majority leader Tom DeLay.The upcoming election cycle is likely to make it even more difficult to achieve progress on critical issues like homeland security. Members of Congress should be judged not so much by their patriotic rhetoric as their unwillingness thus far to adequately finance security at the nation's highly vulnerable ports or to begin inspecting cargo shipments aboard passenger jets. The Coast Guard estimates that $1 billion is needed next year to begin securing the ports; Congress so far has gone no higher than $150 million. And as Washington prepares to remember Sept. 11 Congress should press beyond White House resistance for the fullest inquiry into the terrorist plot's causes and money trail.Given the amount of damage this Congress has done already we might be grateful if the fall brought nothing more than large-scale standoffs already being predicted as lawmakers regather. The sorry House bill to protect gun makers from lawsuits would best die in the Senate. And the welfare reform issue will be difficult to address amid the continuing binge of deficit spending.
 5286,  1988, a, To the Editor:American consumers now pay more than twice what they should for sugar! But Senator Daniel K. Inouye has sponsored a provision in the 1989 appropriations bill for agriculture that would further subsidize a few large sugar refiners under the guise of helping the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries and the Philippines.United States sugar refiners would purchase raw sugar at the domestic price (again more than two times higher than the world price) from Caribbean Basin producers and the Philippines. Domestic refiners would refine and export the sugar to the world market at the substantially lower world price. The taxpayer would then compensate domestic refiners for the difference.This is a business subsidy in its worst form because the domestic sugar program which artificially props up prices by virtually precluding sugar imports from other countries already costs the United States consumer nearly $3 billion a year!And this sugar export enchancement program would cost taxpayers $140 million more a year with the subsidy going to about 10 major refiners.

 5474,  1987, a, Q. Why does inhaling helium make your voice sound funny? A.Resonance the reinforcement and prolongation of sound depends in part on the space in which the sound is propagated and what that space contains. According to Jearl Walker chairman of the physics department at Cleveland State University and author of ''The Circus of Physics'' the resonance of your mouth and throat depends on the speed of sound in the gas they contain. Because sound travels faster in helium than in air your voice has a higher pitch when you have inhaled helium.But take heed: inhaling helium can cause suffocation. Q.Have photographs made from satellites forced cartographers to change any maps? A.Photos and other information from space have resulted in many map changes especially involving underwater features such as reefs according to Alden Colvocoresses a mapmaker for the United States Geological Survey. Some of these features were found to be as much as 15 miles out of place he said.Mr. Colvocoresses who is president-elect of the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing said scientists studying satellite photos were surprised to discover a small island previously unknown off the east coast of Canada. They named it Landsat Island he said after the satellite that spotted it.

 1599,  2010, a, ARLINGTON Tex. — With the Cliff Lee free-agency sweepstakes set to begin one of the Texas Rangers’ new owners launched a preemptive strike on Monday by criticizing Yankees fans for their “violent” and “apathetic” behavior during the American League Championship Series.Chuck Greenberg’s comments during an interview with a Dallas radio station echoed remarks made by Lee’s wife Kristen who said she was treated rudely by the Yankee Stadium crowd and seemed to be a calculated attempt to keep that incident from being forgotten as Texas tries to convince Lee that it would be a better fit in 2011.Although Greenberg apologized hours later first in phone calls to Yankee executives and then in a public statement the assertion he was making about behavior in the Bronx still remained. “I think our fans have been great” Greenberg said in the radio interview on KESN-FM (103.3). “I think particularly in Game 3 of the World Series they just blew away anything I’ve seen in any venue during the postseason. I thought Yankee fans frankly were awful. They were either violent or apathetic neither of which is good. So I thought Yankee fans were by far the worst of any I’ve seen in the postseason. I thought they were an embarrassment.”Not surprisingly Greenberg’s statements did not sit well with the Yankees who nevertheless did not forcefully respond. But they held back only because they were adhering to longstanding guidelines from the commissioner’s office to not do anything to distract from the World Series particularly on days when games are being played.Hours after going on radio Greenberg retreated calling both Hal Steinbrenner the Yankees’ managing general partner and Randy Levine the Yankees’ president to apologize for his remarks.Greenberg then issued a formal apology in which he stated that he “unfairly and inaccurately disparaged fans of the New York Yankees.’’“Those remarks were inappropriate’’ the statement added. “Yankees fans are among the most passionate and supportive in all of baseball.’’Whether the Greenberg apology will be enough to appease the Yankees and particularly Levine who is intensely protective of the Yankees’ brand and relishes the chance to defend it in public remains to be seen.For Greenberg a Pittsburgh sports lawyer who took over the Rangers in August in tandem with Nolan Ryan taking a swipe at New York was an easy way to enhance his status in Texas. If it also helps the Rangers’ cause with Lee all the better.The Yankees are clearly intent on signing the 32-year-old Lee whom they nearly acquired in a July trade and who completely handcuffed them in Game 3 of the A.L.C.S. They hope to lure him to the Bronx with a lucrative multi-year deal that will almost certainly exceed $100 million.Although the Rangers have made it clear they intend to do everything to keep Lee in Texas despite the prohibitive cost of doing so they are viewed as the underdogs in this battle.But a battle it is and with free agency set to begin just five days after the end of the World Series the fight over Lee might end up being more entertaining than the A.L.C.S. which the Rangers won in six games.“We’ve made it clear we’d like to have him back” Rangers General Manager Jon Daniels said of Lee in a news conference before Game 5 on Monday night. “I know we’re not the only club that would like to have him. It’s a competitive market as it should be and we’ll see what happens.”
 1148,  2012, a, I walk around my house naked. My partner often does too. Not gratuitously just often. We don’t bother covering up when walking from bathroom to bedroom. We leave the door open when we get dressed. So far my 8- and 12-year-old sons remain unfazed. If I’m standing nude in the door of the bathroom telling my oldest to clean up the basement the only thing he finds audacious is the request.And both boys still wander around naked; they get hot they strip down. I don’t care about the visuals — naked television watching would be fine by me — but no bare bums on my couch. “Put on underpants” I say. And no nudity at the kitchen table. They may be arbitrary but those are the rules.For years I’ve known this had to change but thought there would be some obvious moment when we’d all know it was time to cover up — some sign from above or at the very least a demand from below. In particular I thought my oldest son as he approached his teens would be the one to draw the line.But nothing that clear has happened. Once he started shutting the door to the bathroom I thought I could take my cues from him — but he’s inconsistent. One day hearing something on the television while he was waiting for the bath he walked in hands covering his parts like a fig leaf unconcerned. Other days it’s “Mom do you mind? Give me some privacy!” while he’s changing his shirt.I’ve tried asking but the topic of nudity is far more embarrassing to him than the nudity itself and I don’t want him to feel like it’s a big deal. I love that it’s not a big deal.I’m not sure where my own inclination to roam around the house naked came from. It’s not like I haven’t struggled all my adult life with my body image. But there’s something affirming about how much my children have always loved and needed my body from breast-feeding to shared baths. That ease with one another’s nudity is part of the depth of my connection to them — something closed doors don’t offer. I know it has to change but when? In my childhood home no private parts were actively on display so no moment ever came when they had to be hidden away.Since I can’t ask my son what “normal” should look like I asked my friends what was going on in their homes. If their teenagers are any indication this Garden of Eden approach is doomed. One friend’s 15-year-old son David outnumbered by his two mothers and younger sister was 7 or 8 when he started closing the door to the bedroom and bathroom. He’s still frustrated that the women in his house leave doors open and trot past his bedroom naked with no respect for his desire not to see them. It’s not like he’s ashamed he says he just wants some boundaries. “And anyway it’s not like Penelope Cruz is walking around naked in my house.”David’s mothers agree they should try harder but it requires effort and they forget.Another friend’s husband is simply defiant: he agreed to the request for no nudity at home but retains the family cottage on a secluded lake with a floating dock as the last bastion against his two teenagers and their battle for familial modesty. The kids still come running to their mom with complaints: “Dad’s on the floating dock naked again. Do something.”Kids exhibit a range of responses to nudity from shame to awkwardness to disgust to letting it all hang out to flaunting it to you can look at me but I’m not interested in seeing you. What’s clear from everyone I talked to is that children set the household nudity agenda and it starts early.As soon as my toddler was old enough to climb into my bed I started wearing pajamas to sleep. As my kids got older they were louder and clearer about their preferences deciding when to display it or shut it away marking their boundaries and independence by withdrawing nudity completely then reintroducing it then withdrawing it again. The idea of no longer being intimately familiar with my children’s bodies makes me sad and yet I have no intention of walking the halls of my house with two full-grown naked men.We’re not ashamed of our bodies and we’re doing our best to ensure our kids feel good about theirs. We’ve defied the prudish version of modesty that makes nudity gross or necessary to hide. I don’t want to bother with a robe to get from the bathroom to the closet. I like that the kids will brush their teeth while I’m in the shower. But our bodies are ours to control. When my children are ready to cover up I’ll respect that. When they ask me to do it too I’ll dress accordingly.It’s all as it should be but I’m allowed to mourn the loss a little now and a little in advance. Maybe I should let them watch TV naked on the couch.
 6167,  1976, a, WASHINGTON Feb. 29(AP) —The General Accounting Office has found that Congress was not notified of 34 agreements between the United States and South Korea since Congress enacted a reporting requirement in August 1972.The 34 agreements were operating carrying‐out or agency‐to‐agency agreements and were not reported to the State Department Office of Treaty Affairs the Congres sional investigating agency reported.The Treaty Office has the responsibility to transmit to Congress the text of any “international agreement” within 60 days under the Case Act sponsored in Congress in 1972 by Senator Clifford P. Case Republican of New Jersey.But the Accounting Office said the Case Act did not define “international agreements’ and that agencies such as the Agency for International Development which administers foreign aid overseas and the Defense Department did not consider subordinate agreements subject to the reporting requirement.
 4855,  1991, a, Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale who was the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1984 said of his party's field for 1992: "Most of them will believe that running for President is simply an extension of running for Governor or Senator. Actually it's entirely different. It's the vastness of the country the differences the demands of people and the sheer exhaustion of it all." A Narrow World View?Democrats are particularly sensitive to the dangers of insular campaigns after their experience in 1988: The campaign of Gov. Dukakis stayed Boston-and-Cambridge-bound until the end and its strategic decisions in the view of many Democrats reflected its narrow world view. Some political professionals wonder if Mr. Cuomo carries the seeds of a similar clannishness."Around any candidate the question is how does he arrive at his decisions who helps make the decisions what's the team that decides" said Ann F. Lewis a longtime Democratic strategist. "The early impression of Mario Cuomo is this has been a very small team of people who have known him a long time."The experience of other Presidential campaigns suggests that kind of team can take you through a couple of early primaries but you can't run a national campaign that way" Ms. Lewis added. "The question of field operatives will be do they have the capacity to grow? Can you trust delegate empower people to act on behalf of your campaign nationally?"Jody Powell the former press secretary to Jimmy Carter who faced a similar task in melding outsiders into a home state campaign was tactful. "If you're the Governor of Georgia you're probably inclined to know that you don't know everything" said Mr. Powell now a public relations executive in Washington. "I'm not saying this particularly about Mario but being governor of a big state like New York or California maybe you don't get quite enough of a sense that you need to learn some things about the rest of the country." Still Mr. Powell noted that Mr. Cuomo had traveled the country over the years. 'Suspicious' New YorkersAnother Democratic strategist a veteran of Presidential politics who spoke on condition that he not be identified said "Traditionally New York State Democrats are provincial in their view of talent: They're the fast lane they're the Big Apple. It's a very tough style and a very suspicious style and it assumes that everyone has some other agenda."But John Marino the New York Democratic chairman who is a Cuomo ally asserted that Mr. Cuomo has faced these kinds of charges before and had shown in his 1982 campaign for governor how he can expand his base. "The fact of the matter is people all across the state joined together to elect him and if this ever happened on a national level we'd get a lot of help from people in different places" Mr. Marino said. "And we'd want it and welcome it."

 3171,  2001, a, Though most of the 46 agencies in the evaluation released yesterday operate group homes for adolescents their residences range in size from small city apartments for three or four teenagers to the 150-acre Westchester campus of Children's Village where the 462 residents include some as young as 5.The three city offices that were evaluated run 30 homes the smallest an apartment for three teenagers under employee supervision the largest three centers that temporarily house 24 teenagers with mental and emotional problems.Some comparisons within the rankings are instructive however. Good Shepherd Services the top-rated agency operates some of the same types of programs for the same kinds of difficult teenagers as the city office in last place.Sister Paulette LoMonaco who has directed Good Shepherd's program for two decades says that one key to its success is a much better staff-to-child ratio than the state requires or that city payments alone would cover. When the state cut foster care rates a few years ago she said she successfully sought grants from private foundations like the Robin Hood Foundation to supplement the city contract.Though state rules allow one staff member to supervise nine teenagers for example Good Shepherd's Barbara Blum home in Brooklyn a short-term diagnostic center for 12 teenage boys never has fewer than three counselors present at all times she said and all its social workers have master's degrees. Ratios are similar at its 34-bed transitional residence for teenage girls on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.At the same time most agencies run such a large and varied mix of residential programs that large differences in quality may be missed by just looking at the rankings. The last-ranked agency for example the city office for Queens and Manhattan runs 12 homes including a quiet brownstone on West 85th Street which is known as one of the best city-run group homes.''We should get a hundred'' protested a 19-year-old girl who was crocheting in the brownstone's cozy living room when a reporter stopped by unannounced this week. ''They talk to us they love us. In my other group home I could leave at 3 o'clock in the morning and they'd be just looking like 'whatever.' ''

 1400,  2011, a, What a difference four years make.In the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination the candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee seemed to take every chance to disparage each another. Each took potshots at the other’s stands on the issues and their track records. Once Mr. Romney even criticized Mr. Huckabee who upended Mr. Romney’s plans to win the Iowa caucuses with a surprise victory for his diction.But on Saturday night when Mr. Huckabee now a Fox News host interviewed his former rival on his show about Mr. Romney’s 2012 campaign things were different. They sat smiling and occasionally offering compliments. They were polite.For some perspective here is a representative television appearance by the two from 2008 campaign. (The captions are not by The New York Times.)On Saturday Mr. Huckabee who is not running for president this year said to his guest that many viewers had tuned in wondering “Would you and I be able to sit in the same room and be civil to each other?”“I think we’ve proven that people can be civil.”And that was perhaps because Mr. Huckabee seemed to pull some of the punches that might have been irresistible four years ago.At one point Mr. Romney replied to an abortion-rights question by saying he believed that life began at conception and he spoke of his desire to see the United States Supreme Court’s landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade overturned. Immediately afterward he seemed to draw less of a hard line saying he would leave the decision to permit the procedure up to the states.In response Mr. Huckabee likened that approach to the conditions in the country before the Civil War but he just as quickly abandoned that idea.Four years ago Mr. Huckabee who opposes abortion rights frequently used Mr. Romney’s less-stringent stance as ammunition and framed Mr. Romney’s view as “flip-flopping.”But there were smiles and cordiality on Saturday night. Mr. Romney even asked Mr. Huckabee a former governor of Arkansas why he had not entered the fray this year. (His response was that he could not run and also continue his television show.) Mr. Romney went so far as to say it would have been “terrific” if Mr. Huckabee had once again run.
 4905,  1990, a, With Tony Jones leading the way Purdue put a vise-like grip on the Big Ten race tonight.Jones matched a season high with 23 points and nine assists as eighth-ranked Purdue remained the conference's only unbeaten team with a convincing 91-73 victory over fourth-ranked Michigan.Jones hit 11 of 21 shots and Stephen Scheffler who finished with 18 hit 7 of 8. Loren Clyburn who scored 15 points was perfect from the floor from 3-point range and from the free-throw line.It was Michigan's worst loss at Crisler Arena since dropping the 1985 home opener to Indiana 87-62.Purdue (16-2 8-0) shot a torrid 70 percent a Crisler Arena record and extended its winning streak to nine games matching the mark of the 1936 Boilermaker squad which also won its first eight conference games. The previous arena-best was 68 percent by Michigan in a 1987 victory over Western Michigan. Michigan (15-4 5-3) had its home-court victory streak snapped at 10 games.

 5440,  1987, a, REMEMBER in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' how the little birdies help the heroine get ready for her day? One of them even fluttered about carrying a ribbon for her hair?Well some of that birdie's relatives have been conscripted to work in a new animated spot for Ice Mountain Maine Spring Water which just began advertising itself this week in New England. What makes it important in addition to the birds is that it is Pepsico's first entry into the fast-growing $1.7 billion bottled water market.But in the 30-second commercial by Waring & LaRosa beautiful white doves soar oer hill and rill as the singer sings ''somewhere on Ice Mountain halfway to the skies pure spring waters rise fresh as morning dew.'' Then two birdies appear carrying a blue banner that they wrap around a big snow-covered mountain. The banner says ''Ice Mountain'' and in a flash the mountain with its banner becomes a label on a large bottle all done to the singing of Lucy Simon sister of Carly.The magic of television. * * *The commercial is running on 13 stations in three television markets reaching four cities: Boston Providence R.I. Hartford and New Haven. The advertising will run during the day and in the early evening aimed at mothers with large families. There are no print ads.

 6368,  1970, a, DETROIT April 2 (UPI)—The Detroit Red Wings moved into third place tonight a point in front of the idle Montreal Cana diens in the nip‐and‐tuck East ern Division battle in the Na tional Hockey League by down ing the Toronto Maple Leafs 4‐2. The victory gave the Wings a three‐point edge over the New York Rangers who also did not play tonight.The triumph gave the Wings a total of 93 points two behind Chicago and Boston who are tied for first. Each team has only two games remaining in the regular season.The Wings led by Alex Del vecchio wasted no time taking charge. Delvecchio pushed the puck past the Toronto goalie Bruce Gamble after 16 seconds of play for his 20th goal of the season—the 11th time he has reached that mark in 19 years in the N.H.L.Delvecchio assisted on two more goals Gordie Howe's 28th of the season and Frank Mahov lich's 37th. Both came in the second period. The other Wings score was tallied by Gary Berg man who took a pass from Paul Popiel at 6:10 of the first period.
 4370,  1994, a, Right after hearing on Wednesday morning that a ferry had gone down en route from Tallinn Estonia to Stockholm Majlis Alm rushed down to the senior citizen's center here fearing the worst.Mrs. Alm a town council member who had previously run programs for elderly residents knew that a group of local retirees were on a ferry trip to Tallinn. When it became clear that it was their vessel that had capsized and sunk she summoned up the will to look at the list of their names. Six of the first eight names she saw were friends. Of the 56 people on the list -- all still missing and presumed dead -- she knew 20 well."I was reading the list and just crying" she said. "It was hard to be of much help to others."In a country that has been knocked off its bearings by the loss of the ferry Estonia and more than 800 of its passengers most of them Swedes no town has taken a harder blow than Norrkoping a placid port city of 120000 people 100 miles south of Stockholm.The 56 travelers from Norrkoping including 14 married couples were nearly all grandmothers and grandfathers longtime residents with relatives and friends all over town. Bengt Malmstrom was known to all as the former chairman of the local health authority. Arne Engberg had long organized a popular bicycle race.

 1536,  2010, a, FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — I liked this puzzle for a variety of reasons. First it had a good-looking grid. Second it was an interesting construction. Third it had a slightly different vibe to it. Fourth there were some clever and different clues.Andrew Sullivanfor The New York TimesThe Details:A construction like this with its waffle pattern of eight 15-letter entries can sometimes make for an easier solve. The higher number of 3-letter answers is a factor. But that’s a good thing in my book. I like a good-but-not-too-tough challenge on Friday reserving the real pain for Saturday. I mean banging one’s head against a wall is great but one day a week is plenty.My favorite clue was “Cook’s final setting.” I thought first of a temperature setting on an oven then a place where a bake-off might be set before finally arriving on HAWAIIAN ISLANDS the setting where Captain Cook died in 1779 at the age of 50.After getting ABE for “Phiz on a five” I still had no idea what that clue meant. Turns out phiz is slang for a face via the word physiognomy.No we’re not cranking “Ask Will” back up on a regular basis but a question came up recently on the cruciverb.com “cruciverb-L” e-mail list which I decided to put to Mr. Shortz:ASK ? WILLQ.What rules do you have for using or not using question marks at the end of clues that involve wordplay?A.• The more twisty iffy or nonliteral a clue is the more likely it is to have a question mark.• A borderline twisty clue may get a question mark early in the week and not get one later even though the clue is worded exactly the same.Sometimes however I have to admit I’m not consistent. Every so often Frank Longo will inform me when he’s test-solving a Times puzzle: “You used [or didn’t use] a question mark the last three times you ran this same clue.” And unless I can articulate a good reason to be different this time I go back to the way I’ve done it before.In sum when to use question marks in crossword clues is not a science. In borderline cases often arguments can be made either way. Sometimes even Frank and I argue about whether or not a question mark is needed on a particular clue. There is no hard and fast rule.A Final Thought: Here’s IVO Pogorelich getting a workout at the Chopin Piano Competition in 1980 one he was famous for not winning.

 642,  2015, a, PhotoTequila is growing up and expanding its boundaries — no longer a mere cheap foundation for obliterating sugary-sweet cocktails. Darker premium golden-amber-hued añejos hailing from the rainy highlands and arid valleys outside of Guadalajara Mexico and aged in wooden barrels for at least 12 months garner attention all on their own for their sophisticated flavor. This spring gives rise to a new wave of pricier ultra-aged extra añejos (casked in wood from three to seven years) like Patrón’s rare and limited Extra Añejo 7 Años which are best enjoyed sipped (pass on the snifter and opt for Riedel’s Vinum Tequila glass — a Champagne-style flute) not mixed into a margarita.But this season añejo offerings from smaller-batch indie labels like Suerte Tequila Partida and Tequila Tapatio — in addition to the larger labels like Patrón Don Julio Chinaco and Espolòn — are both high-quality and reasonably priced with a smart accessible balance of agave expression and wood. The aging process endows añejo tequila with smoky peppery notes much like those of whiskey or scotch — and attendant aromas of sweet vanilla caramel and intense wood plus that refreshing flash of citrus. They make for a fresh logical ingredient in classic cocktails like old-fashioneds and manhattans. Below a trio of handcrafted añejo cocktail recipes from bartenders practicing their craft in a variety of locations from New York City’s mod well-received Mexican restaurant Cosme (in Chelsea) to the handsome dimly-lit subterranean West Village spot the Up & Up to the hip-casual Brooklyn mainstay Extra Fancy across the Williamsburg Bridge. “Añejo tequilas bridge the gap between the purity and liveliness of a blanco tequila and the round and sophisticated character of oak-aged spirits such as cognac bourbon or aged rum” Extra Fancy’s Rob Krueger explains. Añejo-based variations on the Blood and Sand the Negroni and the Rob Roy follow here.GallardoCreated by Rob Krueger for Extra Fancy in Brooklyn N.Y.“This drink is a variation of the Scotch cocktail Blood and Sand which was named for the 1922 Rudolph Valentino film about a bullfighter” Krueger says. “This version takes its name from the main character’s surname which means ‘gallant.'”¾ ounce Roca Patrón Añejo¾ ounce Carpano Bianco vermouth¾ ounce Cherry Heering¾ ounce white grapefruit juice1.

 67,  2019, a, 2D: No class no class at all I tell you. We’re not thinking about someone who is rude though; we are thinking about someone who really has no classes to attend and the answer is DROP OUT.5D: “Fall guy?” is not a guy who takes the fall for a crime he didn’t commit. It’s the guy who fell from grace along with Eve. The answer is ADAM.26D: The official national LAOTIAN currency is called the kip.32D: If the clue “Band aid” had a capital A in the second word and a hyphen in the middle it would refer to the brand name bandage. In this puzzle the thing that is aiding the band is an AMP.36D: “Recess appointment?” was a toughie for me. I think of a PLAY DATE as something parents arrange at each other’s homes not at school. As I remember it recess at school was a chaotic free-for-all. You didn’t need an appointment to play with anyone.40D: I honestly thought this was about underwear. “Boxer rebellion?” was a real thing but with the lowercase R in “rebellion” this clue has to be hinting at something else. The boxer in this clue is a dog and his idea of a rebellion is a DOG BITE. My dog’s idea of rebellion is to hide the TV remote.Constructor NotesThis one takes me quite a ways back! Although this is my sixth themeless puzzle in The Times it was actually the second one I constructed. More than two years ago I had enjoyed working with the layout of my first themeless and decided to try another similar one. I started in the upper right with “I ZOMBIE” as I had just watched the first two seasons (and fittingly its fifth season premiered yesterday!). I remember being quite pleased with how that corner turned out and it still stands out to me now — I especially like how the J X and Z are each at the intersection of two 7- or 8-letter entries. I think the rest of the puzzle still looks pretty good; it’s perhaps not my flashiest puzzle ever but I think it’s solid all around and filled with some nice entries that are accessible to a wide range of solvers. And what’s not to like about the three instances of ‘AO’ in down entries in the lower-right section? Some clues of mine I’m particularly fond of in this one are those for 18-Across 30-Across 7-Down 36-Down 38-Down and 40-Down. That said I’d like to give a special mention to my clue for 22-Across which I am delighted to see in the final version of the puzzle. Not only is “The Bottle IMP” one of my all-time favorite short stories there’s also a devilishly diabolical trick-taking card game of the same name that somehow manages to perfectly capture the feel and tension of Stevenson’s story. Both are highly recommended!The Tipping PointAlmost finished solving but need a bit more help?

 3991,  1996, a, The Dim Side of Love With Just a Touch of Trash Congo Norvell BrowniesCongo Norvell a band from Los Angeles that performed on Tuesday night stalks the border zone between torch-song intimacy and lounge-band kitsch. From her bleached-blond hair to her heavily shadowed eyes to her sheer glittery blouse to her slowly swiveling hips Sally Norvell had the right trash-goddess look; more important she had the voice smoky and aching but with a country belter's reserves of lung power. "Just when I think everything is fine that's when you take everything of mine" she moaned in "Golden Gates" one of Congo Norvell's many self-immolating love songs.Congo Norvell is led by Ms. Norvell and by Kid Congo Powers who has played guitar for the Cramps Nick Cave the Gun Club and the Bad Seeds all groups fascinated by the bleakest Americana and all of them succumbing too often to cheesiness or pomposity.Congo Norvell has more aplomb; since 1992 when it released its first EP the band has refined its pose. Its songs stay slow and somber with their stately vamps pierced by Mr. Powers's sustained distorted guitar notes; Ms. Norvell paces herself saving her most melodramatic outbursts for just a few moments in any song. "I'm glad we don't have any more intact illusions in this room" she said on Tuesday night and the set wasn't over yet. JON PARELES

 932,  2013, a, Last Updated Saturday 12:37 p.m. Bad news readers. New images appear to cast doubt on the accuracy of two of the week’s most widely reported stories: the rumored pregnancy of Syria’s first lady and the pioneering spaceflight of an Iranian monkey.As a Washington Post correspondent Liz Sly reported the office of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria posted five new photographs of his wife Asma on Facebook as part of an effort to disprove a curious aside in a Lebanese newspaper report that she is pregnant. Each of the photographs said to have been taken last week in Damascus shows a very slender Mrs. Assad congratulating the winners of this year’s Syrian Science Olympiad.PhotoAs my colleague Rick Gladstone explained “rumors that Mrs. Assad had conceived in June” were first reported in November by Al Bawaba an Amman-based news Web site. Since the British-born first lady has been out of public view for most of the past year as her husband’s government has struggled to regain control of the country the rumors spread despite an absence of visual confirmation.The photographs were released a day after Mr. Assad’s office issued an indignant statement taking exception to a Washington Post blogger’s reading of the Lebanese newspaper’s story. The statement said the blogger Max Fisher “based his analysis on false allegations that led him to wrong results which are far from reality.”Since Syria’s Science Olympiad takes place every year the president’s office could have recycled images taken a year or more earlier but that would require the cooperation of all of the students pictured with Mrs. Assad. At least one of the students in the new photographs a girl with curly hair wearing brightly patterned sneakers does appear in another image of the winners posted on the Olympiad’s Facebook page.While this set of images appears to back the official story coming out of Syria recently released photographs and video of the monkey that Iran says it sent into space seem to undermine that nation’s claims.As journalists at the German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle pointed out on its Persian language site on Thursday the first reports on the space mission published in Iran’s state-run media showed an anxious-looking monkey prepared for blast-off with a prominent mole above its right eye.PhotoWhen Iran got around to releasing photographs and video of the monkey’s capsule being retrieved post-flight there was no trace of a mole in close-ups of the monkey waving to reporters or smiling at a subsequent public appearance.PhotoThat led to speculation that Iran might have tried to cover up a failed space mission by displaying a different monkey from the one that made a 150-mile round trip into the thermosphere. Or that the newly famous monkey had fallen prey to the Iranian penchant for cosmetic surgery.DW: Iranian Astro Monkey went to space with a mole on his face came back without it. Plastic surgery? #iran //t.co/iN4jxecP — negin shiraghaei (@neginsh) 31 Jan 13The missing mole is not exactly hard evidence that Iranians had a spare monkey waiting in the wings to pretend that it had just gotten back from space. Iran does have a track record of fictionalizing its achievements in rocket science but in July the Iranian Students’ News Agency — which released photographs of the monkey with and without the mole this week — reported that the space agency in Tehran had five monkeys in training for the mission.

 6203,  1975, a, Joe Beauchamp majored in English at Iowa State once upon a time so it would not he farfetched to call him the poet laureate of the San Diver) Chargers.“Someone once said” the Charger cornerback remarked the other day “that it's better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all. Well it's better to have won at least one game than not to have won at all.”Whether the Chargers have loved they're not saying but they haven't won at all this season which means they'll be trying to do that for the first time when they play the Giants at Shea Stadium at 1 P.M. today.If Giant fans think their team has had trouble this season consider the plight of Tommy Prothro's frustrated forces. In six games they have scored a total of four touchdowns and have averaged 6 points a game. They have gained the fewest yards 181 per game in the league and two weeks ago they lost Don Woods their most potent offensive weapon for the season with a knee injury.

 1165,  2012, a, HOUSTON — As the Mets embarked on the second calendar month of the season Manager Terry Collins reiterated that he was very pleased with the way his players had overcome low expectations and injuries to achieve a 13-10 record. Still he was under no illusion that his team was a fully polished product.“Let’s be realistic here this is a work in progress” Collins said. “Let’s not get down. Let’s stay positive. Let’s continue to work.”Collins said he sat down with his coaches Tuesday morning to analyze the team and was struck by the relative inexperience of the players in his lineup.He recalled the discussion: “Let’s take a look at the catcher. How many years has he got? He’s got two. First baseman he’s got two. Second baseman’s got two. Shortstop’s got two. Left fielder’s got days. Center fielder’s got four. Right fielder’s got days.”Collins said the sign that the team was reaching a new level would be if they won games like the one they lost Monday night when they could not capitalize on a strong start by R.A. Dickey.“When you’ve got a guy that almost throws a no-hitter gives up three hits you’ve got a figure out a way to win those games” Collins said.And the way they would reach the next level he said was by learning quickly. Mistakes in Collins’s eyes will be digestible as long as they only happen once.He used a play from Monday’s loss as an example. Kirk Nieuwenhuis playing his first professional game in left field allowed a pop-up by Jed Lowrie to fall in front of him extending a three-run inning. The ball was ruled a hit but Collins said he would expect Nieuwenhuis to make the call and the catch in the future.“This is the big leagues” Collins said. “You’ve got to learn fast you’ve got to adjust fast in the big leagues.”Subway Series Cuts Some Mets players weighed in on reports that Major League Baseball might scale back the number of annual interleague games between teams designated as natural rivals like the Mets and the Yankees.The Astros’ move to the American League next season could mean that natural rivals would not face each other six games a season as they do now although no official scheduling announcements have been made.“Fifty percent of me thinks that it’s such a fun series and it’s so great for the city of New York” said David Wright who has a .314 career average against the Yankees. “The other 50 percent thinks they’re such a good team that it’s almost good if we don’t have to play those guys six times a year.”After more thought Wright added that the “positives probably outweighed the negatives” because of how much he looked forward to and enjoyed playing in those games.“You can always tell when it’s Subway Series time walking around the city because it seems like half the city’s in orange and blue the other half’s in pinstripes everybody’s got a hat on” Wright said. “As much as the players try to think that it’s one game the intensity level is much higher with the fans getting into it and I think that carries over onto the field and makes it more fun for the players too.”Mike Baxter who grew up in Queens said six games a year probably were not necessary. “Especially when the games first started there was always so much buzz” Baxter said. “As long they retained one series a year I think that’s enough.”Flu Bug Hits Lucas Duda who came down with the flu this week was out of the lineup for the second straight game Tuesday night after visiting a doctor earlier in the day. Mike Nickeas also had the flu and was still at the team hotel a few hours before the game.Nickeas’s absence forced Terry Collins to name Mike Baxter as an emergency backup catcher as the Mets considered flying a catcher to Houston for the series finale Wednesday. Baxter played catcher during instructional league games in 2008 while trying to widen his skill set.Baxter incidentally was also singled out last week by Collins as the position player most likely to pitch in a blowout loss. Before Tuesday’s game he was handed Nickeas’s glove and catching gear which he then proceeded to wipe with rubbing alcohol.

If weeks or months of heavy American casualties would hurt so would further disruption of oil supplies which would force up gasoline prices and damage the already weak economy.Like Lyndon Johnson President Bush could find it devilishly hard to deliver either of the two things that matter most to the American electorate -- peace and prosperity. That's why the next few months in the plain words of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas look like "make or break time for George Bush."The prospect of another crippled President one would think would cast a pall over Washington to say nothing of the prospect of war. But no real anxiety grips the capital. In fact the most notable things about the city as the final hours of 1990 slipped by were empty sidewalks silent telephones and offices vacated hours before quitting time.
 6411,  1970, a, In baseball the best relief pitchers are those who “throw strikes” as the managers like to say.And last night for the edification of 38681 spectators at Shea Stadium Ron Taylor threw strikes almost exclusively in preserving a 7‐6 victory for Jerry Koosman over the Pittsburgh Pirates and the triumph gave the New York Mets a two‐game grip on first place in the Eastern Division of the National League.Koosman appeared about to produce his second consecutive complete‐game performance following his sore‐arm problems when Al Oliver doubled and Willie Stargell lofted a homer over the right‐field‐fence in the ninth inning.With the Pirates only a run behind Gil Hodges the Mets’ manager beckoned Taylor his right‐hand man in the bull pen. Taylor threw 11 pitches 10 of which were strikes in disposing of Bill Mazeroski Richie Hebner and a pinch‐hitter Jose Pagan for his ninth save of the season.Three Up Three DownMazeroski struck out on three pitches. Hebner after two strikes fouled off three pitches then popped up. Pagan took ball and lined Taylor's next pitch to Ken Singleton in left field for the final out.
 3473,  1999, a, And then Manager Bobby Valentine noticed something different in Leiter's motion as he pored over videotapes. Last season when Leiter was pitching well he exploded through his follow-through with his left (back) leg. Since the sprain however Leiter had been following through as though his back leg were tied to the pitching rubber.Leiter was held out of a start and he experimented with a new taping method on his sore left knee. Yesterday both Valentine and Leiter said that he had much more explosion with the leg. And Leiter -- who broke a half-dozen Cincinnati bats with his pitches -- said he did not feel unusual soreness from the new knee wrap.But even though Edgardo Alfonzo hit a solo home run in the first and Bobby Bonilla -- in his first game back from the disabled list -- and Brian McRae belted consecutive solo homers in the second to give the Mets a 3-1 lead Leiter could not hold it. He had escaped a bases-loaded no-out jam in the second with only one run allowed. But Sean Casey singled in two runs in the third to tie the game at 3-3.And after the left-handed reliever Ron Villone came on for Brett Tomko with runners on second and third and two out in the third and threw three straight strikes past Robin Ventura (who struck out four times yesterday) the Mets did not record another hit. Villone (1-0) retired the first 12 batters he faced before walking Luis Lopez on four pitches with two out in the seventh. And then right-hander Scott Williamson came on and struck out pinch-hitter Benny Agbayani to end the threat before pitching two more perfect innings for his sixth save.Afterward Valentine liked enough of what he saw of Leiter to say ''He was four or five pitches away from having probably a complete game shutout so we'll build on that.'' But the results were pretty much the same.Another rough outing another loss another five days spent trying to explain.INSIDE PITCHJASON ISRINGHAUSEN threw for nine minutes on the side without problems before yesterday's game and will start tomorrow night's series finale. . . . The probable matchups this weekend at Yankee Stadium are RICK REED versus DAVID CONE on Friday night; MASATO YOSHII and ORLANDO HERNANDEZ on Saturday afternoon and AL LEITER against ROGER CLEMENS on Sunday night. . . . Manager BOBBY VALENTINE on REY ORDONEZ's status: ''Maybe tomorrow. I think he was real close today but I'm not going to put him in there and jeopardize him.'' Ordonez has a mysterious knee injury. . . . The holiday matinee crowd was 28368.

 6326,  1970, a, WASHINGTON Jan. 2 (AP) —The International Monetary Fund said today it had com pleted the first distribution of the new money substitute known as “paper gold.”The I.M.F. said it had allo cated $3.4‐billion of its new special drawing rights S.D.R.'s approved when the Fund's gov ernors met in Washington last fall to 104 of the 115 member nations.Paper gold is a new monetary reserve that will be used only among nations. Those that are participating agreed to accept the S.D.R.'s just as they would accept genuine gold in payment from countries with balance‐of payments deficits.Fowler Among LeadersAmong the leading figures in the lengthy negotiations that brought the S.D.R. plan to frui tion were Henry H. Fowler and Frederick L. Deming of the United States Karl Blessing and Otmar Emminger of West Germany James Callaghan of Britain Michel Debra of France Emilio Colombo and Guido Carli of Italy and Pierre‐Paul Schweitzer managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
 1543,  2010, a, Neil WolkodoffEver wonder if you play better golf riding in a cart or walking? Ever wonder how many calories you burn in a typical round? Or if you would play better if you were in better shape? Ever wonder if golf is truly a sport?Neil Wolkodoff wondered all those things too. And as the director of the Center for Health and Sport Science at the Rose Medical Center in Denver he knew how to find the answers. Two years ago he bought $27000 worth of equipment to conduct a painstaking set of tests on amateur golfers. When he was done he had some findings that could settle a lot of barroom arguments.For example in Wolkodoff’s study golfers scored lower while walking with a caddie or with their clubs on a push cart than they did when using a motorized cart. And golfers carrying a golf bag posted the highest average score.As one might expect the most energy was expended while walking with a bag (721 calories burned for nine holes). But walking with a push cart was not far behind (718). Walking with a caddie burned 621 calories for nine holes and riding in a cart still burned 411 calories on average.“One of the surprise realizations was that just swinging a golf club about 100 times uses up a significant amount of energy” Wolkodoff said.Each of the golfers went through rigorous testing before the study to establish their aerobic endurance and anaerobic threshold levels — the point when lactic acid buildup generally begins to impair coordination and concentration. This became important because Wolkodoff could watch readouts from six pounds of sensors strapped to the golfers and identify when they had gone beyond their fitness level.Neil WolkodoffWhat Wolkodoff discovered was that exceeding one’s anaerobic threshold usually went hand in hand with ineffective golf. Think for example of someone walking up a steep hill and then having to execute a delicate chip without the two-minute recovery period needed to restore heart and respiratory rates to normal.So being fit cuts strokes.“If you’re out of shape exceeding your threshold could happen a few times every round even while riding in a cart because tee boxes and green complexes are often elevated” Wolkodoff said. “Your golf game will suffer. Somebody with the yips might just be a little winded after walking up to the green. At the same time being in better physical condition would make you better mechanically and mentally.”Finally is golf a sport rather than a game?“There are a lot of ways to define a sport” Wolkodoff said. “But we know that the golf swing uses almost every muscle group in the body. We know it uses a pretty significant amount of energy — not as much as running a 10K but more than people think. And one significant measure of a sport is whether physical training improves your ability to perform and I think that’s been proven in golf.“So in my estimation it’s absolutely a sport.”Neil WolkodoffWolkodoff’s study which may be the first of its kind had its limits. Because the equipment was cumbersome expensive and took about two hours to put on and take off his test group was just eight golfers. They were men ranging in age from 26 to 62 and had handicaps from 2 to 17. Each played the front nine at a championship-quality Denver-area course four times on different days — walking with a push cart walking with a caddie walking and carrying their golf bag and riding in a golf cart.Weather conditions were similar each day. The golfers were required as much as was possible to approach the nine holes the same way each time. In other words if they had hit driver off the first tee in their first round they had to hit driver again on the first hole of their final three rounds. The sequencing of how they played the rounds was varied; not everyone played with a golf cart first then with a caddie and so on.The golfers’ results during the four rounds tracked similarly with consistent statistical trends. For example seven of the eight golfers reported the same scoring pattern: lowest while playing with a pushcart (group average was a five-over-par 40 for nine holes) followed by playing with a caddie (42) playing in a motor cart (43) and playing while carrying their bag (45). Wolkodoff received no commercial sponsorship or financing for the study other than from the Rose Medical Center. He donated his time which amounted to about 500 hours.“It’s not a perfect study but I think we discovered some things” Wolkodoff said. “You throw the findings out there and let people take their potshots at them which is fine. I would like to see someone do a follow-up study. But if it hasn’t been done before it’s because of all the time equipment and data involved.”In fact representatives at the P.G.A. of America the United States Golf Association and the National Golf Foundation said they were not aware of studies exactly like Wolkodoff’s. A recent University of Pittsburgh study measured one golfer’s caloric expenditure as he walked with a bag walked with a caddie and rode in a cart. That study put the number of calories burned at higher rates than Wolkodoff’s study — about 1000 calories for nine holes of walking and carrying 750 for walking with a caddie and 650 for riding in a cart. A Swedish study two years ago concluded that golfers there lived five years longer than nongolfers. But nearly all golfers in Sweden walk while playing.“The health benefits of walking was the best news of our study” said Wolkodoff adding that the complete results could be found on his center’s Web site rosechss.com. “Playing 18 holes of golf while pushing a cart twice a week shouldn’t replace an overall fitness regimen but it could be a very worthy supplement.”But on many golf courses it isn’t possible to walk because golf courses promote the use of carts to raise their revenue.“There are positives to golf being helpful to people’s health and wellness” Greg Nathan the senior vice president for membership at the National Golf Foundation said when discussing Wolkodoff’s study. “But there can be an opposite effect. The renting of golf carts is important to the health and welfare of the golf industry.”Add to that the perception that cart use speeds play a myth that has been debunked by several studies but a myth that persists nonetheless. Some golf courses are also designed with long distances between some tees. And of course some people cannot walk the golf course for various physical reasons. Still spreading the word that walking while playing will yield significant health benefits could help the game grow.“I don’t just play golf to lose money to my sandbagging friends” you could tell your spouse. “I do it for both of us because I want to stay in shape.”It would be true and it would apparently help your score and perhaps your wallet.In the end I think Wolkodoff and his many microchips have just scratched the surface. I’ve got plenty of other 19th-hole arguments he could settle: Do golfers usually play better alone or in a group? Do they usually play better in the morning or the evening? Better on the front nine or the back nine?It’s not my research money but I think we’re just getting started.VideoCorrection: August 5 2010An article on Monday about scientific research in golf misstated the surname of the senior vice president for membership at the National Golf Foundation.

 6440,  1970, a, Ralph Nader asserted yester day that the United States would “become a nation of slaves” unless safeguards and human values were integrated “before it's too late” into what he called the unregulated and uncontrolled use of computers.In a wine‐ranging speech at the New York Hilton before the 25th annual convention of the 27000‐member Association of Computing Machinery Mr. Nader described in pessimistic terms the ramifications of a growing computer technology that he said is now “exclu sively in the domain of cor porate and governmental con trol.”Because “the computer and the consumer should be the major concern of somebody in society” the consumer crusader urged his audience to begin to infuse “human considerations and values” into the use of com puters.Mr. Nader predicted that a “citizen backlash” against com puters was inevitable if their use remained completely apart from public review.

 2682,  2004, a, Correction AppendedCarl Levine a former top home furnishings executive at Bloomingdale's whose exclusive imports and elegant model rooms played a large part in building the retailer's image as the hippest store in Manhattan in the 1960's and 70's died on Friday in his Fifth Avenue apartment. He was 75.The cause was cancer his family said.It was Mr. Levine who showed Queen Elizabeth around the model rooms he created for Bloomingdale's during the Bicentennial celebrations in 1976 evidence that the store was a must-stop even for royal tourists.The queen's visit was notable in several respects: it was the first visit to the store by a reigning monarch and was probably the first (and possibly the last time) that part of Lexington Avenue which is one-way downtown was switched briefly to run uptown to accommodate the queen who leaves her limousine only from the right side.Mr. Levine was born coincidentally in Bloomingdale N.J. and was a member of the third generation of his family in the home furnishings business. He joined Bloomingdale's in 1955 as a trainee and graduated to assistant mattress buyer. In 1979 he was promoted to senior vice president.

 2380,  2005, a, The photographer Lane Stewart needed someone to pose for all the pictures: Sidd talking with the Mets' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre; Sidd pitching (as always) in one work boot and one bare foot; Sidd carrying his ever-present French horn. Stewart immediately cast his pal Berton who when not teaching art at a suburban Chicago middle school occasionally assisted him on local shoots and who bore an eerie resemblance to Plimpton's imagined Finch: tall shyly awkward with feet and ears a few sizes too big.Stewart recalled the conversation with Berton:"Joe the Mets have this pitcher down in Florida I have to go shoot" Stewart said. "He plays the French horn his only possessions are a rug and food bowl and he pitches in one work boot. And he's got this 168-mile-an-hour fastball. Can you come with me?""Great!" Berton said."There's only one catch -- you're going to be him.""Huh?"Selected Mets officials were among the few people (including Sports Illustrated editors) even slightly aware of what the magazine was up to. They issued Berton a uniform and allowed him full access to their spring training complex even letting him sit in the bullpen during exhibition games as Stewart clicked away. Fans would ask the weird-looking guy in the No. 21 jersey if he was trying out for the club and he would reply: "Yeah. You'll hear about it later."Did they ever. When Sports Illustrated hit the newsstands several days before the April 1 cover date "The Curious Case of Sidd Finch" staggered baseball and beyond. Two major league general managers called the new commissioner Peter Ueberroth to ask how Finch's opponents could even stand at the plate safely against a fastball like that. The sports editor of one New York newspaper berated the Mets' public relations man Jay Horwitz for giving Sports Illustrated the scoop. The St. Petersburg Times sent a reporter to find Finch and a radio talk-show host proclaimed he had actually spotted the phenom -- who truth be told was back in Oak Park teaching art at Hawthorne Junior High.Alas the enchanting details of Plimpton's story were also its downfall. Harvard and Tibet and the French horn and the 168-m.p.h. heater -- people were gradually brought back to earth by more skeptical acquaintances. (For his part Plimpton always loved how the seventh definition of "finch" in his Oxford English Dictionary was "small lie.") As word spread over several days that the first letters of the article's secondary headline read "Happy April Fools'" the jig was up.Berton became a star. Television crews from across the nation went to his home and school to interview him to have him wear the boot and throw. He became Sidd Finch to thousands of fans and was recognized wherever he went. Even in England a few months later a man almost spilled his drink at the sight of him in an Oxford pub."You're Sidd Finch!" he said. "You're in Oxford!"Soon after the hoax was revealed the Mets decided to stage Sidd Finch Retirement Day. Berton told an oddly dejected crowd "The perfect pitch once a thing of harmony is now an instrument of chaos and cruelty." He received a standing ovation as he walked down the foul line for the last time.

 4007,  1996, a, To the Editor:Having just returned from Ukraine I found much to agree with in "Despite U.S. Hope and Help Ukraine's Star Fades" your June 27 news article on the economic situation there.While you might have given equal time to the more hopeful economic indicators -- sharp drops in inflation the greater pace of privatization (of small and medium-size enterprises like Viktor Gumankov's factory in Zhitomir) and recent exchange-rate stabilization -- the main point is well taken: Ukraine's economy is a mess and it will not improve significantly in the near future.What I do take issue with is the imaginary reference point of a once rich and powerful Ukraine with which to evaluate the situation. Ukraine's unfortunate location at the intersection of more powerful empires has always served to blunt whatever plans its leaders had for economic and political development.In this century alone Ukraine's colonial status in the Soviet empire resulted in horrific famines an economy distorted by a concentration of inefficient defense-oriented industries and the ecological nightmare of Chernobyl for which Ukraine continues to pay a high price.

 529,  2016, a, In the latest hit to the battered bank Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $50 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the bank of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after the homeowners defaulted on their mortgage loans.The proposed settlement calls for Wells Fargo to automatically mail checks to more than 250000 customers nationwide whose home loans were serviced by the bank between 2005 and 2010.The checks will typically be for $120 according to Roland Tellis a lawyer with Baron & Budd the law firm that represented Wells Fargo’s customers. If a judge signs off on the settlement as expected the checks will be distributed next year.When a borrower falls behind on a loan mortgage contracts typically let the lender order an appraisal of the home’s current value. The cost of that appraisal known as a “broker price opinion” can be passed on to the borrower but Wells Fargo used one of its own subsidiaries to conduct appraisals and then routinely marked up the cost according to the lawsuit.

 5353,  1988, a, ''If Mr. Biron had agreed to stay I certainly wouldn't have an interest in joining management'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''But with Ed deciding to leave I made a judgment that I would rather have the title for myself.''Comfed which operates in Massachusetts and Connecticut has been hurt by a weakening mortgage market in New England and Mr. O'Malley said he was concerned about the value of his investment. But he added that the Comfed had a ''decent franchise and should become a reasonable earner.''After graduation from Manhattan College Mr. O'Malley got his start in the mail room of Philipp Brothers a commodities trading company. He soon moved into trading and dealt with ''just about every commodity the company handled'' he said. He spent 10 years in Europe and then took over and successfully ran the company's energy business ''which formed the basis for my rise through the executive ranks'' he said.In 1981 Philipp Brothers by then known as Phibro merged with Salomon Inc. the investment banking house. Mr. O'Malley left Salomon at the end of 1986 and set up the investment business Argus Investments Inc. in Stamford Conn.Argus holds a 24 percent interest in the Tosco Corporaiton a large independent refiner on the West Coast. The group then bought the luxury skyboxes at Giants Stadium and leases them out. ''We then got the Denver boxes and we are negotiating for other ones'' Mr. O'Malley said.
 50,  2019, a, In 2012 the bassist Matthew Garrison and the entrepreneur Fortuna Sung opened ShapeShifter Lab around the corner from iBeam. It was founded as a music club but attendance was not strong enough for it to survive on shows alone. So Ms. Sung and Mr. Garrison have turned it into a flexible event space and recording studio. As the neighborhood around it has gradually grown more residential it has begun to host weddings bar mitzvahs and student recitals as well as regular concerts: “Shape-shifting with the hood” Mr. Garrison said in a recent interview.The shifts have been slow partly thanks to zoning laws which have warded off rapid real-estate development while keeping the area friendly to the small businesses that use it for storage and light manufacturing. As a result while many artists have work spaces in Gowanus few actually live there.But with Public Records open the area may start to have more of a nighttime ecosystem. In nearby Red Hook Pioneer Works has become one of New York’s essential multi-arts spaces and in Park Slope just three avenues over from iBeam Barbés is one of Brooklyn’s most creatively curated pint-size music rooms.

 758,  2014, a, PhotoAdministrivial Will Shortz Sighting! Sorry for the short notice but Will Shortz will be interviewed at 3:30 p.m. Eastern today on MSNBC about competitive crossword solving because there’s not enough competition going on in sports today.SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — An unusual looking mirror-symmetry grid isn’t it? It turns out there are reasons for that and when the hurly-burly’s done hopefully you will see all the great things in this puzzle too.I was very excited when I cracked this grid. I recently went to see the actor Alan Cumming in a nearly one-man performance of “THE SCOTTISH PLAY” (Ssshh … don’t say “MACBETH” if you’re backstage at a performance of Shakespeare’s tragedy. It’s bad luck.) and was bowled over by his ability to play almost all the parts by himself. Not only that but this adaptation of the play placed him in the psych ward of a hospital after having been brought in by the police for having committed a brutal crime. Very haunting!Speaking of haunting how about that weapon in the middle of this puzzle by Dick Shlakman (who appears to be making his debut) and Jeff Chen? You didn’t miss it did you? Take your writing implement of choice and connect the circled letters which just happen to spell out MACBETH (ssshh!).Ah there is a dagger you see before you the handle toward your hand. Worry not that there appears to be BLOOD dripping from it at 100 Down. If you’d like to see the answer key that was made specially for this puzzle you can click here to see it in all its gory I mean glory.And take a moment to enjoy the really delicious entries some having to do with the play some not. I loved MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS KNOCK KNOCK WHO’S THERE DURAN DURAN ONE FELL SWOOP A CHARMED LIFE WHAT’S DONE IS DONE BANDOLERO TOODLE-OO KAHUNA and of course THE SCOTTISH PLAY.I get the feeling although I can’t confirm it that the cluing was made a bit easier today but I’m not sure why that would be since the trick to the puzzle is mainly visual. It doesn’t really matter; it’s a lovely puzzle with great fill and I smiled all the way through it.Let’s hear from Mr. Shlakman and Mr. Chen:Constructor NotesJ.C.: Thus continues the saga of “JEFF VS. DAN on Jeff’s own puzzles.” My solving time: 6:39. You’ll find Dan’s time (and that of the other speedsters posted at Dan’s blog. Curious to see how badly he beat me this time. It’s been over 30 puzzles now and I still haven’t won. Heck sometimes I don’t even come within a factor of two! Very fun collaborating with Dick on his big debut. He came up with the idea and I helped him refine it. I actually didn’t do that much. The credit should go to him. It’s tough to come up with clever ideas for a New York Times Sunday puzzle. Ah the gridwork. Not as much of a challenge as I’ve encountered in some other constructions but a toughie nonetheless. There are only six themers but incorporating the dagger with the MACBETH letters made it tricky forcing us to deploy our black squares quicker than we had desired. This left big open spaces in the NW and NE and without those cheater squares (the two stair patterns at the top of the grid) it looked pretty hopeless. We debated whether EXERCISERS was legitimate eventually deciding it was KOSHER and were glad that it allowed the snazzy BANDOLERO and LITERATI to work. The other tricky spot sort of sneaked up on us. Because of the word count limitations (140 max) we had to incorporate a few long across answers IONE SKYE notably. It’s a nice entry in itself but boy did it cause problems. Because it crossed three theme answers there weren’t many options there besides IONE SKYE and once that was fixed into place KIEL was the best we could do at that spot. Now I’m a huge fan of James Bond villains and Jaws in particular but even I don’t like having to remember who played him. And having OHO OOH OH I UH OH … that’s my fault. Sometimes at a certain point (in this case maybe 50 attempts) you’ve done your best. Ah well as with most constructions there will be compromises. I had a great time working on this with Dick and I welcome anyone who’s interested in collaborating (Read: allowing me to ride on your coattails as I politely shoot down all your ideas until something fun emerges) to contact me at jeffchen1972 (at) gmail.com. D.S.: If the byline for co-constructors was set in type reflecting the respective contributions of each my name would be in 8-point pica type and Jeff’s in 20-point BOLDED and italicized. I am very different from most who construct puzzles accepted by The New York Times. At age 74 words and wordplay continue to delight me but trivia does not for I will forget it 5 minutes after I learn it. I have already forgotten every movie star and character name in Star Wars never saw a Hobbit movie and know not of any pop music title performer or album after the 1960s; I have often argued there was no pop music after the 60s. I do not attempt any crosswords or other puzzles except the Sunday New York Times and it takes me close to an entire day to get near finishing one. When I discover the theme and theme words and other fun fill that is not a proper noun I consider the puzzle successfully solved. Notwithstanding this lack of both crossword completion skill and practice it has been a dream (or a bucket list item) to see my name attached to a Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle. (I think it is the same syndrome that causes me to enjoy writing poetry but not reading it.) I had many theme ideas (none architectural) and no ability whatsoever to take the next step. One Sunday in checking my many unfilled answers at Rex Parker’s blog I saw a comment from Jeff volunteering to work with “noobies”. My initial response was to send Jeff an idea for a puzzle involving homophones and a lengthy list of potential theme answers. That effort ultimately led to the co-construction of a puzzle containing homophones as the theme answers submitted to and accepted by Will for a Wednesday publication but it has not yet been published. (Would that constitute foreplay if this is my maiden appearance?) During the course of working with that puzzle Jeff taught me the most basic of New York Times crossword construction requirements to wit: that theme answers need to be internally very consistent and “tight” (a comment I have heard from Jeff as he has with considerable grace declined to co-author virtually every other idea I have submitted to him!) and that the fill must be neat and clean and interesting with as little reliance on “crosswordese” as possible. My original idea and theme word selections for this puzzle centered on well-known expressions first introduced into the English language by Shakespeare. Not “tight enough” opined my new mentor. He suggested we try for such theme content from one play only. He also authored the idea of using Macbeth and working in as the reveal clue the reference to the superstition against mentioning the play’s name (which was the subject of a marvelous Canadian television series called “Slings and Arrows” season 2 also shown in the U.S. on Sundance). In our division of labor we collaborated and contributed equally on the selection of the Macbeth quotes Jeff did the grid and virtually all of the fill and I took the lead in and supplied much of the clues. Will of course had much to say about the clues. (I am reminded of Justice Jackson’s aphorism about the Supreme Court: “We are not final because we are infallible but we are infallible only because we are final.”) Jeff and I are curious about whether the extent of the clue-editing is average or more or less than average. Perhaps Will will enlighten us.And when we all meet again in thunder lightning or in rain it will be time for the Monday puzzle.Here’s a clip of Alan Cumming in The National Shakespeare Company’s presentation of … well you know:Your thoughts?

 2145,  2007, a, MORGANTOWN W. Va. — For West Virginia the most important fan among the 60000 in attendance tonight will be Terrelle Pryor a Pennsylvania high school quarterback. He’s the consensus No. 1 player in the country and seemingly an ideal fit for the Mountaineers’ spread offense. Pryor is most often compared to the former Texas quarterback Vince Young and has narrowed the list of universities recruiting him to Ohio State West Virginia Florida Penn State and Tennessee.In this interesting diary in The Pittsburgh Post Gazette Pryor talks about how he’s rooting for W.V.U. and O.S.U. to play in the title game. Pryor is 6-foot-6 225 pounds and as prolific a thrower as he is a runner. He was scheduled to play in a playoff game this afternoon for Jeannette High School and make it in time for kickoff.The West Virginia staff couldn’t have scripted a better environment for Pryor’s visit. The atmosphere here is expected to be the best in the history of the state. If you don’t believe the hype on Pryor pick your poison on these You Tube clips. You don’t need to be Tom Lemming to see Pryor’s boundless potential.

They compared Miss Batura's show to the exhibition scheduled to open tomorrow at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

 1421,  2011, a, After a string of smaller deals in the oil patch over the last two years Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is gearing up for a potential blockbuster takeover.The private equity giant is in exclusive talks to buy some or all of the Samson Investment Company a family-owned oil and natural gas exploration company according to a person briefed on the matter.K.K.R. has been studying a possible Samson transaction for some time and has been lining up financing with several banks this person added cautioning that the talks could still fall apart.Should the two sides reach a deal it would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis of September 2008. K.K.R. can already lay claim to one of the priciest private equity deals in the last year having led the purchase of Del Monte Foods for $5.3 billion.Samson currently runs more than 4000 wells and has at least partial ownership of more than 11000 wells across the country according to its Web site.Among its businesses is drilling for oil and natural gas in shale formations an increasingly popular tactic that has driven a wave of takeovers in the energy industry.A deal would bring to a close the Schusterman family’s 40-year control of Samson which has become a respectable oil exploration player that is still based in Tulsa Okla. The company’s current chairwoman and chief executive is Stacy Schusterman daughter of the founder Charles Schusterman.Ms. Schusterman acknowledged the company’s discussions with K.K.R. in an internal memorandum obtained by The Tulsa World:“If a definitive agreement is reached with K.K.R. it will be because they recognize both the value of our assets and our team” Ms. Shusterman said in the statement. “K.K.R. has stated that if we move forward they are committed to building our team at each of our current locations.”A K.K.R. spokeswoman declined to comment.News of K.K.R.’s talks with Samson was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

 3672,  1998, a, ''In the past'' Mr. McVeigh wrote ''you would see the news and see a bank robbery and judge him a 'criminal.' But without getting too lengthy the Federal Reserve and the banks are the real criminals so where is the crime in getting even? I guess if I reflect it's sort of a Robin Hood thing and our government is the evil king.''Miss McVeigh later told the F.B.I. that her brother once told her he planned a bank robbery with others who carried it out and showed her the large stack of $100 bills he said was his share. She said he had given her three of the bills and asked her to give him $300 in smaller denominations.Four months before the bombing Mr. McVeigh who was moving from place to place around the country while keeping a mail drop in Kingman Ariz. wrote his sister in a letter mailed from Caro Mich:''Of course you must realize then that I'm not living in Arizona. You know how hard it is to get into that deep of a lie with Dad? It's painful especially how you have to look so confident when telling stories (lies).''''Why am I running?'' he added. ''I am trying to keep my path 'cool' so in case someone is looking to 'shut up someone who knows too much' I will not be easy to find. I have also been working and establishing a 'network' of friends so that if someone does start looking for me I will know ahead of time and be warned.''''If that 'tip' ever comes (I have 'ears' all over the country) that's when I disappear or go completely underground. Believe me if that necessity ever comes to pass it will be very difficult for anyone to find me.''In the greatest stroke of luck in the Federal investigation Mr. McVeigh was arrested shortly after the bombing by an Oklahoma highway patrolman who noticed that his car had no license plate.An extensive investigation failed to establish any operational links between Mr. McVeigh and other anti-Government groups. But documents from the investigation show that several witnesses supplied tantalizing details to support such a possibility.

 68,  2019, a, To the Editor:Re “Can Joe Biden Be Forgiven?” by Lucy Flores (Op-Ed April 30):I believe that the reason Mr. Biden is not doing a satisfying apology to either Anita Hill or Ms. Flores (and anyone else he was too physical with) is that he is still hoping to appeal to President Trump’s male voters and he doesn’t want his apology to be campaign fodder for Mr. Trump however well meaning it may be.The problem for Mr. Biden is that he may be overestimating what an apology means to men at the expense of underestimating its meaning to women.Gayle Pickard-FishmanEnglewood N.J.To the Editor:Studies have revealed that those who refuse to apologize after hurting others feel more powerful as a result. Conversely those who do apologize feel less powerful even as they stand to benefit by repairing a fractured relationship.As disappointing as it may be it should come as no surprise that both our president and those vying for his position seem oddly allergic to those two little words: I’m sorry.

 1621,  2009, a, Played six days before the SEC and Big 12 meet in the national championship the Cotton Bowl may give fans a glimpse of what lies in store for Florida and Oklahoma. On one side we have Ole Miss — the only team to beat Florida during the regular season. On the other high-flying Texas Tech’s offensive philosophy provides a similar picture to Oklahoma though more skewed towards the passing game. The same questions exist here as do in the B.C.S. national championship game: Can Texas Tech control the Ole Miss front seven? Can the Ole Miss secondary contain Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree? And like the national title game the Cotton Bowl is expected to be a good one.The Cotton Bowl: Friday Jan. 2 at 2 p.m. in DallasMississippiWhat a difference a year makes for the Rebels who ended last season on the lowest of low notes (blowing a 14-0 lead in the Egg Bowl). What a difference a new coach makes as well. Houston Nutt has reversed the losing trend developed under Ed Orgeron who led the Rebels to only 10 wins over three seasons. Few bowl teams finished the regular season hotter than Ole Miss which won its final five games to finish 8-4 its best record since the Eli Manning-led 2003 team went 10-3. The Rebels’ quarterback is the Texas transfer Jevan Snead who was terrific in his first year as the starter. He threw 15 touchdowns against only 2 interceptions during Mississippi’s five-game win streak. End Greg Hardy and tackle Peria Jerry combine to give Ole Miss one of the most formidable defensive lines in the country.Texas TechBecause of the hullabaloo about who was left out of the title game you tend to forget about the teams who were left out of the B.C.S. entirely. Texas Tech along with Boise State is a team with a genuine B.C.S. resume (a 39-33 win over then-No. 1 Texas for starters) which found itself on the outside looking in. The Red Raiders are the only one-loss team from a B.C.S. conference left out. Of course the reason Tech is in the Cotton Bowl and not say the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl was the 65-21 trouncing dropped on it by Oklahoma which did irreparable damage to its national standing. Word of the wise to the Red Raiders: Sleep on this game don’t come to play and Ole Miss will be only too happy to take full advantage. Thinking outside the box keep an eye on (if you can find him) the diminutive receiver Eric Morris who finished second on the team with eight receiving touchdowns. Morris makes Wes Welker another undersized Tech receiver look like Randy Moss.Mississippi Bowl HistoryRecord: 19-12Last appearance: 2004 Cotton Bowl vs. Oklahoma State (W 31-28)Texas Tech Bowl HistoryRecord: 10-20-1Last appearance: 2008 Gator Bowl vs. Virginia (W 31-28)Cotton Bowl HistoryFirst played in 1937Last year: Missouri 38 Arkansas 7Bowl Pick ‘EmPete: Mississippi.

New question that Rebels Coach Houston Nutt can ask his team next season: “How many have won a bowl game before?”Paul: Texas Tech. But the Ole Miss front four is going to give Tech fits.Fred: Texas Tech. Love the Red Raiders and love Mike Leach. This is one of the more intriguing non-B.C.S. bowl games. I just think Texas Tech has too much offense.Connor: Texas Tech. Ole Miss is headed on the right track with Houston Nutt but Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree make the Red Raiders too explosive.
 1689,  2009, a, Paula CourtAudiences on the West Coast will soon be able to have their senses overstimulated by the Wooster Group’s trippy production of “La Didone.” The New York-based theater troupe will begin a partnership with REDCAT the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater in Los Angeles the Wooster Group said on Friday. Cynthia Hedstrom the troupe’s producer said in an interview that the collaboration would bring several Wooster Group productions to REDCAT for residencies of one to two weeks over the next three to five years. The partnership was reported on the Web site of The Los Angeles Times. Ms. Hedstrom said that “La Didone” the Wooster Group’s cross-pollination of a 1641 opera and a 1965 horror film “Planet of the Vampires” would play at REDCAT from June 11 through 21 and that a production of Tennessee Williams’s “Vieux Carré” is scheduled there for February.
 4663,  1992, a, A United Nations envoy called today for the Security Council to send more peacekeeping soldiers to Bosnia and Herzegovina and give them new powers to counter abuses including the practice known as "ethnic cleansing" that has made refugees of scores of thousands of Bosnians mainly Muslims.The envoy former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland said the United Nations peacekeepers were powerless to prevent the "massive and grave violations of human rights occurring throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina."Blaming all sides in the conflict for such abuses Mr. Mazowiecki's report singles out the fate of Bosnia's beleaguered Muslims as being "particularly tragic" because "they feel that they are threatened with extermination."The former Polish Prime Minister who was sent to the Balkans by the United Nations Human Rights Commission to investigate violations said the United Nations should send more peacekeeping forces to the region let them patrol the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and order them to "react directly" to human rights violations assisting victims and reporting on all atrocities they witness.

 1823,  2008, a, With an eye toward the next campaign season in New York City when top offices will be up for election Ray Rivera finds that donations from the real estate industry traditionally a dependable source of campaign contributions have soared to three and four times the rate of previous election cycles as part of an effort to beat strict new limits. The surge is driven in large part by a major overhaul in the city’s campaign finance law which starting this month will cap contributions from people who do business with the city at less than a tenth of what is now permissible. That means many developers brokers landlords and contractors will be limited to giving $400 to a mayoral candidate compared with $4950 now.The Times examined contributions from executives and others affiliated with 25 of the city’s most prominent property management brokerage and real estate development companies and found Councilwoman Melinda Katz chairwoman of the powerful Land Use Committee had received the largest amount in donations: $196266 from the 25 companies.Giuliani Down but Maybe Not for LongRudolph W. Giuliani may have temporarily diminished his marketability both as a $100000-an-appearance public speaker and as a purveyor of corporate advice after his presidential bid resulted in bruising news coverage of his personal and professional life and his campaign strategy was widely panned Eric Lipton writes.In addition Giuliani Partners which provides corporate consulting and security advice clearly suffered during the campaign as his attention was focused elsewhere according to former and current executives. Its client list declined as did revenues they said. The company has about 50 employees down from roughly 60 a few months ago and several pending departures involve people in ranking positions. But despite his poor showing in the campaign Mr. Giuliani remains attractive to corporate clients looking for access to government officials in New York or Washington particularly if Senator John McCain whom Mr. Giuliani has endorsed wins the presidency.One person whose visibility was reinvigorated by the Giuliani campaign was the Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight who became a fixture on the Giuliani campaign plane in the Giuliani campaign bus and at Giuliani campaign events in the waning weeks of the failed bid.Female Voters Make Their CaseInterviews with dozens of women across New York — a crucial part of the Democratic primary — show that many are bringing an intense almost visceral connection to the election according to an article by Anemona Hartocollis. How women vote will be critical in a state with one of the biggest delegate prizes on Super Tuesday since they represent 55 percent of registered Democrats statewide and 60 percent in the city. A statewide poll released last week showed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ahead among all women though black women strongly favored Senator Barack Obama. But black women were also more likely to be undecided than most other groups.Principals Angry Over Sudden Budget SlashingPrincipals across New York City discovered on Thursday morning that their budgets had been slashed overnight by sums ranging from $9000 to $447587 as a result of the city’s new tighter budget. They reacted with unvarnished fury in part because the cuts come in the middle of the year when they have already hired teachers planned their schools’ schedules and promised their students and parents certain perks like after-school programs. Many principals vented their anger in pointed e-mail messages.The Giants Haven’t Played in New York Since Disco Was PopularClyde Haberman’s NYC column looks ahead at the showdown most immediately in New Yorker’ minds.

 3195,  2001, a, In ''Mysterious Object at Noon'' the director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has devised a distinct kind of entertainment. Early on in this hybrid documentary made in Thailand a young woman who is not an actress relates a horrible incident. Her father short of money to get home from a trip sold her to her uncle. As she gets through the story questioning her own worth the off-camera director asks her a peculiar question: ''Now do you have any other stories to tell us? It can be real or fiction.''She wipes tears from her cheeks and mutters ''What else can I tell you real or fake?'' Is the filmmaker trying to distract her from her horrible tale or does he have something wholly different in mind?Whatever his agenda Mr. Weerasethakul's odd request leads him across Thailand where a cross section of people pick up the new story the girl invents and add their own details. The movie is like a combination of the gossip game and the old fable ''Stone Soup'' in which suspicious villagers toss contributions into the pot of a wanderer to make a stew unlike any other; the wanderer's intent is to bring them all together. And that's the best way to describe what ''Mysterious Object'' will do for audiences. It's a film unlike any other complete with a title that sounds like a remark that would result from a U.F.O. sighting.The picture which begins a run today at Anthology Film Archives is shot in grainy black-and-white that sometimes seems to have pixels the size of pocket change. ''Mysterious Object'' which is in Thai with English subtitles is similar to the exercise in which assorted writers each contribute a sentence or sometimes a chapter to build a single story. By traveling through Thailand's countryside to encourage townspeople to spin the narrative the film offers a beguiling look into the country.
 5154,  1989, a, Roberto Cossa's comedy ''La Nonna'' is sometimes dark and often its humor may be too robust for delicate sensibilities. But in the production by Repertorio Espanol the Argentinian writer's play at the Gramercy Arts Theater is very funny; the laughter it brings from the audience is gleeful and utterly unashamed.Mr. Cossa toys with some dangerous themes. How many playwrights would risk making a 100-year-old matriarch a comic monster? There are rough ethnic jokes; people fall victim to nothing more blameworthy than their own innocence; calamities are made ridiculous. The play is a formidable challenge to a director and cast.In this case seven regulars from the Repertorio Espanol under the direction of Braulio Villar create characters whose absurdities ward off an audience's sympathy and keep the action moving so swiftly that there is no time for ethical reflection. And they do it without turning the characters into cartoon figures even though some of the pranks here put one in mind of the mayhem of Saturday morning television.The story is simple enough: A family of Italian extraction in Buenos Aires is driven into poverty and desperation by its centenarian grandmother who is eating them out of house and home. Her language is a hilarious mixture of Italian and Spanish but she is easy to comprehend; every word is about food and she does nothing but eat.
 2658,  2004, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this two-part lesson students first examine the United States electoral college system and understand it as it applies to the 2004 presidential election. They then learn about the twelve battleground states in this year’s election and predict election results.Author(s):Annissa Hambouz The New York Times Learning NetworkYasmin Chin Eisenhauer The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: Two one-hour class periodsObjectives:Students will:1. Express their understanding of the United States electoral process including the electoral college.2. Learn about the battleground states in the 2004 presidential election and the significance of their electoral votes by reading and discussing the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line.”3. Develop an informative pamphlet on the history function and controversy of the electoral college system.4. Investigate the political traditions history and potential impact of each of the twelve battleground states in the 2004 election by reading and discussing state-specific articles from The New York Times.5. Make election predictions for the battleground states as well as a general prediction for the election based on their battleground state predictions; compare predictions to the final election results.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils-paper-student journals-copies of the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041101monday.html (one per student)-resources on American electoral politics such as civics or government textbooks and encyclopedias-computers with Internet access-copies of each of the following articles (enough of each for 1/6 of the students):ArkansasColoradoFloridaIowaMichiganMinnesotaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoOhioPennsylvaniaWisconsinActivities / Procedures:DAY ONE: UNDERSTANDING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt written on the board prior to class: “How are the President and Vice President of the United States elected? Jot down everything that you know about the process.” Allow students a few minutes to write and then have them share their responses briefly with the class. Depending on the level of the class students’ responses may range in understanding from popular votes to explaining the electoral college system. If students are unfamiliar with the electoral college be sure to define it. Discuss the following as a class: What do students know about the relationship between popular votes and electoral votes? How did this topic come up in the 2000 presidential election? What might be some of the benefits of the electoral college? Why might some perceive it as unfair? What is a battleground (or swing) state and how are they related to the electoral college and the candidates’ campaigns?2. As a class read and discuss the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line” (found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041101monday.html) using the following questions:a. How many states does the article refer to as “hard-fought”? What does this mean?b. What have the candidates done to campaign in these pivotal states?c. How many electoral votes are needed for a presidential candidate to win the election?d. How many electoral votes does each of the battleground states mentioned in the article have?e. Why might Ohio be considered a particularly important battleground state according to the article?f. What might pose a threat to John Kerry’s candidacy in Minnesota according to the article?g. How might the 2004 election prove to be more of a legal controversy than the 2000 election according to the article?3. Explain to students they will be working in groups to create parts of a class-wide pamphlet about the United States presidential and vice presidential electoral process to inform students their age who might not be familiar with the electoral college system. Divide the class into four groups and assign each one of the following topics to cover in the pamphlet (written on the board or copied on a handout for easier student access):GROUP ONE: HOW THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WORKS This group explains the difference between popular votes and electoral votes how electors are allotted to each state how electors are appointed and how and when electors cast their votes.GROUP TWO: HISTORY OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group examines the electoral college’s origins how the electoral process differs from the Constitutional Convention’s 1787 plan; Article II Section I of the Constitution; the 12th and 23rd Amendments to the Constitution; and disputed elections throughout history.GROUP THREE: THE DEBATE OVER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group addresses the controversy of the “winner take all” system arguments to abolish the college as well as arguments to defend the system.GROUP FOUR: THE FUTURE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group investigates proposals to reform the electoral college including direct elections proportional representation and the “national bonus plan” and the likelihood for abolition of or alteration to the system in the future.Using all available classroom resources groups research their pamphlet topics. Students should be sure to make note of the bibliographical information of the sources they use. Once groups have completed their research each group should type its section of the pamphlet in a predetermined font and font size. Each group’s section should take up approximately one column of a tri-fold pamphlet. Create the class pamphlet by folding a paper into thirds. The front of the pamphlet may be designed by a student. The next four columns should include the four groups’ works. The final column should provide bibliographical information. Completed pamphlets should be copied and distributed in a future class. (They may also be made available to other students.)4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Each student should view The New York Times 2004 Election Guide Interactive Graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/) which allows one to view a voter map of the United States geographically by number of electoral votes and by battleground status. (If home Internet access is not available the maps may be printed out and distributed to students). Using the information from the maps each student creates a chart listing the states deemed battleground states in the left column with the other columns detailing the number of electoral votes each state receives its current status as leaning toward one of the bipartisan candidates or as an unclear or swing state and the party for which state voted in the 2000 election. Then each student should write a journal entry analyzing how the information on these maps might be used to predict the outcome of the election.DAY TWO: BATTLEGROUND STATES AND PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class create the chart assigned for homework on the board and fill in only the names of the twelve battleground states (Arkansas Colorado Florida Iowa Michigan Minnesota Nevada New Hampshire New Mexico Ohio Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Leave the columns under the headings “Number of Electoral Votes” “Current Status” and “Party Voted for in 2000 Election” blank. When students enter class assign each a blank to fill in on the chart using the data they compiled for homework. Once the classroom board chart is complete have students compare it to their homework charts for discrepancies and then discuss their responses to the homework journal assignement.2. Divide class into six groups and assign each group two battleground states and their corresponding New York Times articles:ArkansasColoradoFloridaIowaMichiganMinnesotaNevadaNew HampshireNew MexicoOhioPennsylvaniaWisconsinEach group should read and discuss each of its two articles aloud and answer the following questions after reading each article (written on the board for easier student access):-What makes this a “battleground state” in the 2004 election?-What is this state’s particular political history or tradition?-What information provided in this article might provide a clue to which candidate might receive this state’s electoral votes?-Based on the predictors in the article how do you think this state will vote on November 2 2004?After groups have read their assigned articles and answered the questions on each state the class should reconvene to fill in a final column added onto the battleground states chart on the board titled “Prediction.” Each group should provide their prediction with a brief explanation. Based on the groups’ predictions for the twelve battleground states and the Interactive Graphic maps’ predictions for the other 38 states whom does the class predict will be the winner of the November 2 2004 election?3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students should follow the televised election coverage and evaluate whether the predictions for their assigned battleground states were accurate. In their journals students should analyze why their predictions were right or wrong as well as their reactions to the election results.Further Questions for Discussion:-In your opinion should the electoral college system be preserved abolished or changed? Why?-How did the 2000 election change the way Americans view the electoral system?-Do you think the Osama bin Laden tape mentioned in the article will have an impact on the election? If so how? If not why not?-Why do you think so many of the so-called “swing” states are in the Midwest?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on journal responses contributions to the class electoral college pamphlet participation in group discussions well-informed battleground state and election predictions and thoughtful response to the outcome of the 2004 election.Vocabulary:intensity tinglingly deployed stump furor trending conservatism wooing troika third-party hairbreadth treacherousExtension Activities:1. In the 2004 Election Guide interactive graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/) The New York Times addresses the “Nader Factor” or those states where Independent and Reform parties candidate Ralph Nader has been included on or blocked from the ballot. Research the controversy and litigation around Mr. Nader’s candidacy and write an article for your school’s newspaper about his role in the race for the White House.2. On November 6 2001 U.S. Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) introduced three new pieces of electoral reform legislation to the House of Representatives. Investigate these bills and create a chart tracing the progress of each from its introduction to the present time. Then offer your opinion about each of these bills.3. With terms such as “battleground” and “the ground war” as examples from the American political vocabulary brainstorm as many war metaphors as you can. Compile the list into glossary of war metaphors (which can be expanded upon using different themes such as sports or nature) with definitions and examples of usage for each.4. Using the 2000 election as an example create mock television news coverage for the other instances in United States history in which the electoral college votes differed from the popular votes. Had television existed in those times what issues or controversies surrounding the elections of 1824 1876 and 1888 would have made the news?5. During election week read The New York Times every day and analyze its balance of coverage of the candidates. Alternately create a headline timeline of articles related to a specific theme such as a specific candidate candidates’ views of one another key issues voting trends or personal reactions to the election. (To order The New York Times for your classroom click here.)Interdisciplinary Connections:Economics- How much did each candidate in the 2004 election spend on his campaign? Research and chart the campaign finances of the bipartisan and third party candidates.Global Studies- Research the electoral systems of Australia Great Britain and Canada. Explain and compare each to the United States electoral college in a creative presentation to your class.Mathematics- The article read in class mentions the “limitless ways” the two main candidates could reach the “magic number” of 270 electoral votes. Based on the research conducted in class create ten different mathematical combinations that would result in victory for each candidate.Other Information on the Web:The Learning Network’s Election 2004 special feature (//www.nytimes.com/learning/election2004) explores issues at the forefront of this year’s election through lesson plans and Times articles as well as provides other resources for your classroom.The New York Times Election 2004 section (//www.nytimes.com/pages/politics/campaign/) offers a collection of articles and interactive features on this year’s presidential election.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Civics Standard 20 – Understands the roles of political parties campaigns elections and associations and groups in American politics.

Kellner senior vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''The slowdown was obscured by the fact that it began coasting downward from a high growth rate of 5 percent and is even now running at about 3 percent if one eliminates the impact of last summer's drought.''Mr. Kellner expects the next batch of economic statistics will show a slowing both in the economic growth rate and in inflation. Why then has the Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan been pushing up interest rates for many months? In Front of Inflation''Because it has to stay out in front of inflation not to react to it'' Mr. Kellner answered. ''Even today Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said that his policies would be considered successful if they prevented inflation from rising above the current level of roughly 5 percent. We think the fourth-quarter G.N.P. data tell us we are witnessing the topping out of inflation.''

 3863,  1997, a, Once upon a time people thought Joe Namath was a long-haired rebel.Today the 54-year-old happily married father of two girls had advice for the Jets' most controversial player Keyshawn Johnson: apologize to Wayne Chrebet.Asked to respond to Namath's suggestion Johnson said no.Some of Namath's controversies during the 1960's seem quaint now -- sporting a Fu Manchu mustache donning pantyhose for a commercial. There was however a more painful period for Namath when he briefly retired after refusing to sell his interest in a restaurant Bachelors III that the National Football League security office believed was a hangout of alleged mob figures.The controversy swirling around Johnson's book appears to be lingering longer than its sales. In ''Just Give Me the Damn Ball!'' the receiver described his rookie season in passages interspersed with capital letters and bold face and italic sentences and he called Chrebet the team mascot and suggested he would have a hard time making other teams. There were also passages of grudging praise for Chrebet the workmanlike receiver from Hofstra University.''If in fact he did say that Chrebet couldn't play for any other team in the N.F.L. Keyshawn better look in the mirror or listen to somebody'' Namath said. ''He's got to understand he's wrong.''

 3992,  1996, a, No."You did not go through the proper channels for this request" replied Director Wang Shibang a senior officer in the Fujian Province Public Security Bureau. "We were told that you were here to discuss immigration problems. If you want something else you should go through proper channels."Captain Duke on his first trip to China was mystified by this kind of round-in-a-circle language since he had asked from day one to meet local Fuzhou police. Two Chinese-American police officers on the trip Sgt. Douglas Lee and Det. Hayman Goon were equally at a loss.It was anyone's guess whether Director Wang was under orders from Beijing to block any new meetings or was afraid to let even a small ray of sunlight into the murky operations of a police force that was a target of a corruption probe two years ago or was just being a bureaucrat.At a final dinner Captain Duke and Director Wang sat next to each other but did not exchange a single sentence in an hour-long meal. Director Wang resisted when an American took a photo of those at the table finally agreeing but then changing his mind and demanding that the unexposed film be handed over. It was.Captain Duke said later that despite the frustrations the trip had been worthwhile. If a single life is saved through future cooperation between the two sides he said that would justify the effort and cost under $20000 shouldered by the N.Y.P.D."We came we saw we asked we didn't get" said Captain Duke 55 a beefy gray-at-the-temples man over a Tsingtao beer at a hotel bar where he and his colleagues spent their last evening chuckling about the week's misadventures. "That's life. It's their system here their rules."Although they could not be sure Captain Duke and his colleagues said they sensed that many of the police officials they met were nervous about setting up any formal cooperation with an American police department without a formal protocol or treaty.
 3822,  1997, a, Indeed the nonprofit institutions traditionally relied on for incubating transfer hits -- Lincoln Center Theater the Joseph Papp Public Theater the Manhattan Theater Club -- all failed to deliver. So did a dazzling assembly of some of this country's finest playwrights. Ms. Wasserstein's ''American Daughter'' Craig Lucas's ''God's Heart'' Christopher Durang's ''Sex and Longing'' and Lanford Wilson's ''Sympathetic Magic'' were muddled disappointments.Yet if these plays were to different degrees failures they were noble failures hamstrung by nothing less than their desire to tackle big subjects. The problem was that each wore its themes (politics and sex politics and gender politics and cosmology) like bumper stickers without connecting them to any persuasive sense of character or situation. Granted the theater of polemics if invested with enough outrage can occasionally flare entertainingly as a sustained rant. Witness Jonathan Reynolds's fiery if long-winded diatribe against political correctness ''Stonewall Jackson's House.'' But it usually takes more than a Shavian debate especially without Shavian vitality to hold our emotions.Consider the Vineyard Theater's ''How I Learned to Drive'' one of only two not-for-profit productions to make a commercial transfer. (It is now at the Century Theater Center.) In it Ms. Vogel embraces a subject child molestation that has been too tidily and too often rehashed in best sellers and TV movies and turns it into a seductive memory play that startles at every turn undermining easy assumptions in both form and content. Under Mark Brokaw's deceptively light-handed direction with terrific performances by David Morse and Mary-Louise Parker the production gives the illusion of coming to troubled life before your eyes. Gracefully stylized it also generates a sense of spontaneity that never lets its audience become too comfortable.That is what one asks of the theater of course and what no other medium can provide. In a world increasingly dominated by replicated distancing images theater exists unconditionally in the present tense and at its best appears to invent itself on the spot. Again the formula for creating such magic isn't easily broken down.Who would have thought for example that 19th-century courtroom transcripts generously laced with academic and contemporary journalistic commentary could be edited and shaped into something as sensationally involving as Moises Kaufman's ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde''? Mr. Kaufman both the writer and director of the play (the other nonprofit commercial transfer this time to the Minetta Lane) has created a work as artificial and mannered as a Wildean epigram. Yet within minutes of the first scene you have accepted its terms; you have already learned to think in other words in the original theatrical language that Mr. Kaufman has devised.Wilde himself (Michael Emerson in a career-making performance) effectively loses his case when the artistic frame through which he sees and presents life slips. Because Mr. Kaufman expertly holds onto his stylistic frame which locates the protagonist both in time and in history he allows us to experience Wilde's real pain all the more acutely. A Wildean paradox in itself its use achieves an effect of which both film and written fiction are incapable.''The Waste Land'' T. S. Eliot's recondite generation-defining poem of 1922 seemed to be another most unlikely candidate for theatrical adaptation. Yet the brilliant Irish actress Fiona Shaw in a one-woman show directed by Deborah Warner brought a specific emotional clarity to the work that never stooped to literal explanations. The result was astonishingly affecting.

 6233,  1973, a, Harry P. Charlesworth former vice president of Bell Laboratories and retired assistant chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company died Saturday in Montclair N.J. He was 91 years old and lived in North Caldwell N.J.Mr. Charlesworth who retired in 1941 was a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined the Bell system in 1905 and helped develop the first trans‐Atlantic telephone communication system and the ship‐to‐shore telephone system.Surviving are three sons Roger Robert E. and Richard L.; a daughter Mrs. James Timpson and 10 grandchildren.
 2577,  2004, a, Consolidated Edison asked the New York State Public Service Commission yesterday for permission to raise electrical rates by an average of about $5 per month for its commercial and residential customers.An increase is needed the utility said to offset rising energy and equipment prices and to help pay for work on underground wiring transformers and substations. The company is asking for an additional $550 million in revenues which it said was necessary because of a 20 percent increase in electrical use in New York City and Westchester County over the last decade.Joan S. Freilich executive vice president and chief financial officer of Con Edison said in a written statement that the increases would ''make possible the system upgrades necessary to provide the reliable and safe delivery of electricity.''Under the proposal a typical residential customer paying $58.66 per month would see an increase of $5.40 or 9.2 percent. A typical small business paying $116.55 a month would see an increase of $5.04 or 4.3 percent. If granted after a review process new rates would take effect April 1 2005.

 5106,  1989, a, Sergio Leone the Italian director who revived western films in the 1960's and added distinction and style to a genre known as spaghetti westerns died of a heart attack yesterday at his home in Rome. He was 67 years old.Mr. Leone who co-wrote many of his films gained fame and catapulted Clint Eastwood to international stardom by directing and co-writing three violence-packed hits ''A Fistful of Dollars'' ''For a Few Dollars More'' and ''The Good the Bad and the Ugly.'' The protagonists were cool laconic beleagured loners dueling in a spare sun-blanched terrain.The director who hailed John Ford as his mentor said ''All the killings in my films are exaggerated because I wanted to make a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns.'' Another guideline was that women were introduced only if they advanced the plots. Otherwise he said a love situation ''arrests the rhythm of a story.'' 'Strength and Simplicity'''The cowboy picture has got lost in psychology'' he told an interviewer. ''The West was made by violent uncomplicated men and it is this strength and simplicity that I try to recapture in my pictures.''
 256,  2018, a, Yet it did. On Oct. 2 came the denouement. There was a protest meeting that afternoon in the Plaza of Tlatelolco. The army had been given orders to dissolve the meeting but their assault ended in a cross-fire between soldiers and the mysterious “Olympic Battalion” a paramilitary group created by the government posted in nearby buildings.It was the unarmed students who paid with their lives. The hellish violence went on for hours. No one knows the exact number of dead. There was talk of hundreds. Perhaps there were even less than 100 slain but the scenes of horror the arrests and imprisonments the revelations of torture would linger in our collective memory down to the present day.Over the years various theories about the massacre have been proposed. The C.I.A. seemed to believe in a conspiracy forged in Cuba a theory that was brandished by Mr. Díaz Ordaz. However for better or for worse such an idea was highly unlikely since Mexico was the only Latin-American country that had refused to break off relations with Castro. In his unpublished memoirs Mr. Díaz Ordaz asserts that Mexico was “at war.” The students were “the opponents.” After the killings he would write in a tone of satisfaction “They finally obtained their insignificant deaths (sus muertitos).”The real war unleashed in 1968 Mexico was the struggle for the presidential succession in 1970. As had been the custom since 1929 a Mexican president would designate his successor. Various government secretaries would wage a no-holds-barred struggle to gain presidential favor. Luis Echeverría secretary of the interior would finally be the winner because in the eyes of Mr. Díaz Ordaz he showed “more pants” and was “the boldest.” And he also effectively nourished the president’s paranoia.Perhaps the greatest contribution of ’68 was in behalf of freedom of expression. Although as president Mr. Echeverría Mr. Díaz Ordaz’s successor tried to ingratiate himself with university students through a rhetorical veering to the left the criticism he kept receiving from the newspaper Excélsior (very much in the spirit of ’68) exasperated him enough that he maneuvered a coup (in July of ’76) against its editor Julio Scherer.
 2379,  2005, a, Some restaurants stand at unusual culinary crossroads. Metropol stands at an unusual cartographical one.It faces the intersection of two numbered streets that sound to the uninitiated as if they should be parallel to each other and about a quarter mile apart. But West Fourth and West 10th do indeed meet an asterisklike exception to Manhattan's usually tidy grid an anomaly that happens to be Metropol's address.The restaurant itself represents a more typical convergence.It's part bistro part brasserie those terms and genres being so thoroughly confused and conflated in New York these days. Globe-shaped lighting fixtures dangle from a pressed tin ceiling. A distressed mirror dominates one broad wall.To those vintage flourishes Metropol weds the semiotics of a certain kind and era of downtown Manhattan cool. There are enormous black-and-white photographs of Edie Sedgwick Andy Warhol Nico. There's a thick cover of darkness.

 5053,  1989, a, Transit officials have no firm figures on the number of homeless living in the tunnels but say they have found several hundred furnished rooms some complete with running water electricity furniture and such conveniences as televisions within the labyrinthine New York City subway system.The transit police fear that the homeless are increasingly risking death to have such a space for their own. ''They all want their own little piece of turf'' Sgt. John Greco head of the Homeless Outreach Program said. ''It is definitely getting much worse.''A spokesman for the transit police Albert W. O'Leary said that he sympathized with the homeless but that the perils of tunnel life forced them to be removed. ''Being homeless is not against the law but being homeless in a tunnel is very dangerous'' he said. Two Dozen Killed Each YearAbout two dozen people - excluding suicides - are killed by trains or by the rails in the tunnels each year and a ''significant number'' of those are homeless he said.Last month according to a police report Linda Howe a homeless woman looking for a private place to go to the bathroom walked off the Lexington Avenue and 23d Street platform and into the tunnel. Commuters screamed warnings to her and then watched in horror as she was crushed to death by an uptown No. 4 train.Mark White 29 who has lived in the Lafayette Street Station tunnel for almost two months said two friends had been hit by trains one fatally.''He was my good drinking buddy'' Mr. White said of a friend he identified only as Richard who was killed by a subway car in October.

 3484,  1999, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students in technology classrooms review how microprocessors work examine Moore’s Law and related it to the predicted end that is in sight for silicon dioxide-based transistors used in billions of chips.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Define various parts of the components of microprocessors and how they are interrelated.2. Examine how the miniaturization of computer chips affects the amount of silicon used to insulate them and how this relates to the end that is in sight for silicon transistors used in chips by reading and discussing “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip.”3. Understand Moore’s Law focusing both on the relationship between time and the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit and the relationship between time and the cost of new microchip technology.4. Draw connections between Moore’s law to the information provided in featured article.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-copies of “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:NOTE TO TEACHERS: This lesson plan assumes that students are already familiar with how computer chips work.1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: On a piece of paper each student defines the following terms based on their current knowledge: microprocessor integrated circuit chip transistor semiconductor material and digital circuit. Students then share their definitions and review how these components are interrelated.2. As a class read and discuss “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip” focusing on the following questions:a. Why is silicon dioxide “nearing the end of its usefulness as a main component of microchips”?b. Why must the layer of silicon dioxide on computer chips become increasingly thinner as chips get smaller?c. How did scientists discover “that the silicon dioxide layer needed to be four or five atoms thick to act as an insulator”? What will happen when the layer of silicon dioxide is too thin?d. Why are computer chips becoming smaller?e. What other techniques are in experimental stages so that there can be a viable replacement for the present transistors? What are the benefits and drawbacks of these techniques?f. What examples can you think of that support Dr. Isaac’s statement in the last paragraph that “history has shown that if something can be done someone will find a way to do it”?3. Explain Moore’s Law to students focusing both on the relationship between time and the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit and the relationship between time and the cost of new microchip technology. (Intel co-founder Gordon Moore observed in 1965 that each new computer chip is released approximately every 18 months with double the data density as the previous chip.) Many Web sites provide excellent explanations of Moore’s Law including Intel’s Microprocessor Hall of Fame (//www.intercast.de/intel/museum/25anniv/hof/moore.html) and More on Moore’s Law (//www.eco.utexas.edu/undergraduate/Forum/ML/index1.htm). Be sure to emphasize that though Moore’s Law is referred to as a law it is really a prediction.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In their journals students respond to the following question: How does Moore’s law relate to the New York Times article “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip”? Students should use specific details from the article to support their reasoning. Students may also conduct further research on Moore’s Law and its predictions for the future of the silicon chip.Further Questions for Discussion:–What items in your home and school have microprocessors?–How do microprocessors work?–Why do computer chips continue to get smaller?–What is the importance of computers in your life?–How has computer technology changed the world in the past fifty years?–How do you anticipate computers changing the world in the next fifty years?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on a review of the function of the components of a computer chip participation in class discussion and written journal entry that demonstrates understanding of Moore’s Law and how it applies to silicon chips.Vocabulary:transistor absolute viable insulator semiconductor electrons atom quantum theoretical optimistic miniaturization contaminate capacitor electrostatic nanotechnology implementingExtension Activities:1. Create a “How It Works” poster about microprocessors or integrated circuits.2. Design a handout for your classmates about Rock’s Law and Parkinson’s Law of Data defining these two “laws” and how they relate to Moore’s Law.3. Learn about nanotechnology and other atomic innovations that could affect how atoms are manipulated and the possible outcomes.4. Create a computer jargon guide including commonly used computer terms such as bits bytes RAM and ROM.5. Write a biography about Gordon Moore the co-founder of Intel and the creator of Moore’s Law.6. Develop an illustrated timeline tracing the history of computers and their capacities.7. Visit the Web sites of various computer companies such as Intel Lucent I.B.M. Apple and Sun. What are the missions of each of these companies? For what advancements in technology is each company responsible? What advancements do these companies envision for the future?Interdisciplinary Connections:Language Arts/ Social Studies- Write a reflective essay discussing the role of computers and the importance of speed in our increasingly technological world.Mathematics- Explore the math behind creating and using microprocessors and Moore’s Law with Online Math Applications (//tqjunior.advanced.org/4116/Science/science.htm).Science- Learn about different materials that serve as insulators and the technologies that use them.Teaching with The Times- Use headlines from The Times to create a collage of news about computers and their impact on society or create a scrapbook of articles to follow the news about computer technology improvements and limitations.Other Information on the Web:Intel’s A History of the Microprocessor (//www.intercast.de/intel/museum/25anniv/index.htm) is an interactive museum that includes the history of Intel important people involved in the development of microprocessors explanations of how transistors work and how chips are made and lesson plans for teachers to use in their classrooms.Computer Chronicles: From Stone to Silicon (//despina.advanced.org/22522/) is a ThinkQuest site about how the computers that we use today came into being.Lucent Technologies (//www.lucent.com/) designs develops manufactures and services systems and software which enable network operators and other service providers to provide wireline and wireless access local long distance and international voice data and video services and cable service.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Technology Standard 3- Understands the relationships among science technology society and the individual.

 7481,  1964, a, The nation's largest wholesale drug distributor announced yesterday that it would manufacture and sell tetracycline at about one‐third the price at which it is sold by other manufacturers in the United States.Tetracycline is a broad‐spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a variety of bacterial infections. Yearly sales in the country total about $100 million or about a third of the total sale of antibiotics.The announcement was made by McKesson & Robbins which said that it would offer pills for about 6 cents each wholesale or about $6 for 100 250‐miligram tablets. A spokesman for the company said that other drug concerns that manufacture tetracycline in the United States sell it for “slightly more than $17 a hundred tablets wholesale.”Chas. Pfizer & Co. one of the discoverers of tetracycline immediately announced that it would file suit against McKesson. & Robbins for patent infringement.

 5383,  1987, a, Even before ABC's mini-series ''Amerika'' had begun production powerful foes were trying to keep it off the air. In 1985 the Kremlin warned ABC's Moscow bureau of possible reprisals if the show ran.Earlier this year United Nations officials criticized the seven-part series which is scheduled to begin Feb. 15 for portraying corrupt international peacekeeping forces joining the K.G.B. in a takeover of the United States. A number of religious and disarmament organizations have also opposed the series while Reed Irvine of the conservative group Accuracy in Media complained it made the Soviet occupiers seem too nice.Perhaps the biggest blow came last week when the Chrysler Corporation decided that its commercials keyed to the theme ''The Pride is Back - Born in America'' were inappropriate for a series about Soviet conquest. After viewing six hours of it Chrysler's chairman Lee A. Iacocca decided to cancel about $7 million worth of commercials.Chrysler was the largest sponsor but ABC officials vowed that the show would go on. Meanwhile the Soviets who have denounced ''Amerika'' as ''psychological warfare'' are offering to buy it for Soviet television apparently as an example of American propaganda.

 5071,  1989, a, Despite the encouraging findings the report warned that drug use is still rampant in high schools with 39 percent of the students saying they used some illicit drug in 1988 and 54 percent saying they had tried such drugs at least once in their lifetime. The 39 percent is a decline from 42 percent in 1987 and 54 percent in 1979 the peak year.As part of the study about 1200 college students who had taken the survey when they were in high school were also surveyed. The researchers found a similar pattern in declining drug use among those older students.Titled ''Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth'' this 14th annual survey has been one of the nation's major sources of data on drug abuse. Although it was administered confidentially by University of Michigan researchers there is no way to judge whether the respondents were fully candid.The study does not taken into account high school dropouts who make up an estimated 15 percent of the target age group. ''We really can't say with much certainty whether a similar decline in crack use is occurring among the high school dropout segment of the population'' Mr. Johnston said noting that crack use is widespread among that population particularly in inner cities. Marijuana Use Still FallingThe study did not include drug use trends in specific cities or among specific racial groups. Mr. Johnston said he was still completing a fuller report that might include such data.Among other findings about high school seniors were these:* Marijuana use continued its long-term decline falling from 11 percent in 1978 to 3 percent in 1988.* The use of hallucinogens stimulants tranquilizers opiates other than heroin and nitrite inhalants all declined by statistically significant amounts last year. The number of seniors who say they have tried heroin at least once in their life remained at less than 1 percent percent after a decine a decade ago.
 5277,  1988, a, In Robbins v. California he said: ''It is often forgotten that nothing in the Fourth Amendment itself requires that searches be conducted pursuant to warrants.'' The Chief Justice seems to have sanitized the language of the Fourth Amendment by asking us to forget that the ''right of persons to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.''In Mapp v. Ohio decided in 1961 the defendant was convicted of possession of obscene literature. Her conviction was based primarily on the introduction in evidence of supposedly lewd and lascivious books seized during an unlawful search of her home. At the trial no search warrant was produced by the prosecution. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of conviction holding that the rule excluding evidence unlawfully seized was ''an essential part of both the Fourth and 14th Amendments.'' This is the exclusionary rule criticized by Justice Rehnquist.Now we are told ''what a person knowingly exposes to the public even in his home or office is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection'' (quoting Smith v. Maryland 1979) even the intimate details and habits of the life he or she leads in the home.It is no wonder that Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in dissent ''that members of our society will be shocked to learn that the Court the ultimate guarantor of liberty deems unreasonable our expectation that the aspects of our private lives that are concealed safely in a trash bag will not become public.'' He also stated ''Scrutiny of another's trash is contrary to commonly accepted notions of civilized behavior.''Finally Justice White writing for the majority failed to note that an Orange County ordinance required the respondents to ''remove from their premises at least once a week all solid waste created produced or accumulated in or about his dwelling house.'' Accordingly respondent Greenwood cannot be said to have voluntarily placed his trash in an area accessible to the public. He had no choice and was merely acting in compliance with a county ordinance. He was held to have surrendered his subjective expectation of privacy but not in a manner society accepts as objectively reasonable. Society would not accept the proposition that a person merely by placing a letter or book in a mailbox for pickup by the postal carrier has surrendered reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of either. In 1789 James Madison wrote in ''Annals of Congress'' (Volume One page 439) that ''independent tribunals of justice will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights'' (Amendments One through 10 ratified in 1791). Now almost 200 years later the Supreme Court of the United States has indeed encroached upon rights expressly granted in the Fourth Amendment by trashing our privacy. WILLIAM M. BRINTON San Francisco May 18 1988
 4993,  1990, a, Samuel Houston Mayes the principal cellist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Philadelphia Orchestra for many years died on Aug. 24 at his home in Mesa Ariz. He was 73 years old.His wife Winifred said he had died of heart failure and had recently had open-heart surgery and surgery for colon cancer.Mr. Mayes was born on Aug. 11 1917 in St. Louis. He began playing the cello when he was 4 years old and entered the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia when he was 12. He joined the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1936 and became the orchestra's principal cellist three years later. In 1948 he became the principal cellist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra remaining there until he returned to his former post in Philadelphia in 1964.Mr. Mayes left the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1973. He was the principal cellist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for a season before he retired from orchestral performance and joined the music faculty of the University of Michigan. In addition to his wife he is survived by two sons William Rogers Mayes of Fairfield Conn. and Joseph Francis Mayes of Pittman N.J.; a stepson Nicholas Winograd of State College Pa. and a sister Esmeralda Treen of Milwaukee.
 5279,  1988, a, Mr. Kornegay and Mr. Middleton were also convicted of second-degree felony murder and second-degree burglary; Mr. King was acquitted of those charges.About two hours earlier the jurors told Justice John J. Leahy that they had reached a verdict on two of the defendants but could not reach a decision on the third believed to be Mr. King. A key prosecution witness had testified that Mr. King attended a planning session in a crack house in which he suggested one of two plans for murdering Mrs. Greene. But Justice Leahy directed the jury to continue to deliberate.The two murder charges each carry a minimum sentence of 15 years to life and a maximum sentence of 25 years to life. The burglary charge is punishable by a sentence of 5 to 15 years. By law the sentences will run concurrently because they arise from the same crime. As the defendants rose separately to face the jurors who stood with an American flag hanging on the wood-paneled wall behind them the sounds of evening traffic drifted in through the open windows.After the verdicts were read Mr. Middleton who faces a robbery charge in another incident slumped into his seat and bent his head forward onto the back of his lawyer's chair. Mr. Kornegay who is already serving 25 years to life on a previous murder conviction sat down and rested his face on his hands. And Mr. King a senior at a Manhattan trade school at the time of his arrest stood with his head drooping at one point. Before his arrest in this case he had no criminal record.Key evidence in the case was a videotaped confession by Mr. Middleton that he fired a 9-millimeter pistol at Mrs. Greene's head as she lay on the floor of the car service office after she was shot with a sawed-off shotgun by Mr. Waddel Winston 27. Mr. Winston is to be tried in the murder later.

 3042,  2001, a, Yesterday's playoff game against Denver was supposed to be the ultimate test for the Ravens' vaunted defense. In the first three weeks of the season the Broncos scored 111 points for the best three-week output in franchise history. For the season the Broncos averaged 30.3 points second in the National Football League to the Rams.Yesterday the Broncos playing without their starting quarterback Brian Griese were held to 3 points -- a 31-yard field goal in the second quarter.Billick was asked if this game elevated the Baltimore defense. His response underscored the irritation among the Ravens over a widespread perception that the defense despite its gaudy statistics (four shutouts only 165 points allowed) is overrated.''The only place it's going to elevate it is with you all'' Billick said referring to the news media. ''A lot of you all didn't believe. You were discrediting what we did because of a certain number of opponents we played or the style of play and the fact that a lot of yards were put up. Whatever. It doesn't elevate this group. The way people may look at us it may change a little bit.''Mike Anderson the top candidate for N.F.L. rookie of the year is a believer.Long after yesterday's game was over Anderson the Broncos' hard-running running back sat in front of his locker going through the agonizing postloss routine. He put away a thick playbook packed his bags for the last time. Anderson came into this playoff game with all kinds of impressive numbers. He had rushed for 1500 yards and was first among N.F.L. rookies in touchdowns scored. He rushed for 251 yards against the Saints the most yardage in a single game by a rookie. In his 12 starts Anderson averaged an N.F.L.-best 122.6 yards.

 357,  2017, a, We also lived like nomads. Local Berbers built traditional tents that housed up to eight competitors between stages. There weren’t any toilets. We used plastic bags and peed in plain sight of one another.How do runners prepare for the Marathon des Sables? I ran a lot including the Badwater Cape Fear 51.4-mile race to get comfortable with sand running. I tested and retested my gear. I read race reports. I sweated in the sauna. And I trained my gut to become accustomed to dehydrated food: Every day for three months I ate instant mashed potatoes after I ran.It took almost no time to realize how ineffectively I had prepared for the Marathon des Sables.I could feel the Sahara laughing at me. The mesh in my shoes let in fine sand causing me to shake out large amounts every few miles. At the end of the first day I begged at the medical tent for tape to cover the tops of my shoes. Before turning me away one French doctor peered into my eyes and said “I treat people not shoes.” I noticed that people who complained of sore shoulders were receiving lots of tape. And so began my daily ritual of feigning shoulder pain to solve my shoe problem.Image Nathan DeWall used extra tape on his shoes each day to keep the Sahara desert sand from seeping through the mesh. Credit... Nathan DeWallThe first stage acclimated us to the desert and our living conditions. We also learned the race’s grave risks. To start the race you have to show a race doctor an EKG that was taken within 30 days of the start of the race and jeeps and helicopters were on standby to take people to nearby hospitals if needed. One man experienced cardiac arrest at a water checkpoint. His training partner howled in horror. The doctors revived him with CPR. His race was over but he left with his life.The next two days involved dozens of miles of climbing and descending sand dunes and mountains. When I reached the top of a rocky climb I celebrated by giving one of my tent mates a high five. Ian Corless a British photographer and founder of the Talk Ultra podcast shot me a grin and said “Get ready for the fun part.”

 2731,  2003, a, It has been more than two years since a federal appeals court ruled that Wilbert Rideau had to be set free or retried for shooting three people during a 1961 robbery and then cutting the throat of a woman as she tried to crawl away.In that time the district attorney here has engineered the selection of a white judge to retry the case won the disqualification of the black judge who replaced him and fought to keep the case before a third judge who had worked in the district attorney's office for 11 years. Mr. Rideau is black and his victims were white.Forty-two years after the crime the district attorney Rick Bryant is determined to convict Mr. Rideau for a fourth time and ensure that the key to his freedom is thrown away for good. Today the third judge was disqualified for conflict of interest and Mr. Bryant immediately moved to appeal.The defense is equally hard-nosed in arguing that Mr. Rideau has paid his debt to society fully if not fourfold considering that until the 1970's people sentenced to life in Louisiana were often paroled after 10 or 15 years. Mr. Rideau -- who is technically in pretrial detention and was even eligible to vote in last fall's elections -- has still not tasted a day of liberty.

''The only cause might be if some injustice was being done to recreational vehicles'' said Lou van Dyck a retired public relations officer for the State of New York and the club spokesman.''We hate when people call us Byamites'' said Frank Sargent a club member for 27 years. ''We're not a cult or anything.''They hate when people say they are snobby. ''Tent campers seem to think Airstreamers like the Cabots and Lodges only speak to God'' Mr. van Dyck said ''so we work hard speaking to everyone.''A 100-Member Police ForceJim Creel a retired teacher who heads the unarmed 100-member all-volunteer Wally Byam police force said he never heard of a participant at a major rally being arrested.

 605,  2015, a, Slide ShowTHURSDAY PUZZLE — I truly hope you’re not sick of hearing about the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament because we’re not done yet. Yes the big boards have been put away and I’m still working on another photo feature called “Humans of A.C.P.T.” but in the meantime above are some highlights from Puzzle 7.Today’s bonus question is this: When is a homage to a fellow constructor not merely a homage?Answer: When it’s a collaboration with the very constructor you were honoring.In 2008 a puzzle by Joe Krozel garnered a lot of attention because the black squares formed a word that seemed incendiary for a crossword puzzle. If you haven’t solved this one give it a try. The concept behind the letters formed by the black squares and their connection to the clues made a Thursday puzzle — supposedly the “trickiest” one of the week if not the most difficult — absolutely take flight.Today Timothy Polin collaborates with Mr. Krozel on a similarly awesome idea that also carves a word into the grid. Not happy with merely one word however our constructors have chose to anagram the four letters S H U and T and turn the conceit of “clue in the clues entry in the grid” on its ear. While the bracketed [One arrangement of the letters in the grid] is what we’re given in the clue list the clue to the anagrammed arrangement of letters is actually the answer. Not sure what I’m babbling about? Check this out:1 Across: CABANAS which is what you get when the four letters spell “H-U-T-S” 21 Across: SEAL which is what you get when the four letters spell “S-H-U-T” 8 Down: REAR which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-U-S-H” 26 Down: ERGO which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-H-U-S”And while there is the teensiest bit of junk in the grid I think the fill here is mic-drop fabulous. Look at those long entries: STUPID PET TRICKS ATOMIC REACTORS REESE’S PIECES (you had me right there Messrs. Polin and Krozel) SPINAL TAP BLEEP OUT NATIONAL PASTIME ALL THOSE AGAINST (my personal favorite) and SEASONED TO TASTE.Our constructors have a lot to say about the construction of this very cool puzzle so I’ll turn it over to them:Constructors’s Notes:Timothy Polin: When I thought up this idea about a year ago I held out almost no hope that I’d be able to complete the puzzle on my own. Such a wide-open grid was pretty daunting even without four theme answers that had to fit somewhere. I played around with it and managed to fit three themers and fill everything left of the S but I just couldn’t finish the East half. So I set the puzzle aside. In all likelihood it would have remained in draft limbo forever too had Joe not written me a very kind email last year after my comments on Xword Info had referenced a couple of his puzzles. I jumped at the chance to ask the creator of this puzzle’s inspiration for his take on my take of his grid letter concept. By some miracle he liked the idea and it took us five or six weeks to go from empty grid to submission. The final grid ended up with about half of Joe’s fill and about half of mine. Joe did tremendous work refining the theme insisting among other things that the theme entries be at least four letters long and spaced throughout the grid. Using SIC instead of ERGO for example would have made our task easier but the longer entry felt more elegant and more exact. Joe Krozel: Tim approached me with this puzzle theme all worked out and I was impressed that he had found a set of letters to accomplish the trick. So the challenge that Tim invited me to undertake was to actually fill a grid which embodied his idea. My first little bit of meddling was to shorten the S and expand the H and the U … reducing the three-letter count from 24 to 17. We knew the East region would be difficult so we generated a list of potential theme words that could be sprinkled around the grid. I suspected that a short theme entry could hide inside the ‘S’ so it was only a matter of being persistent to get that region to fill. Once that section was locked down and PORTRAITS was in place we concentrated on the West until achieving a fill we were happy with. We both had fun last August trying to figure out how to “solve” this puzzle’s construction and we hope you enjoy your own solves as well.I would say that Mr. Polin and Mr. Krozel have given their puzzle that “extra push” as Nigel Tufnel of SPINAL TAP would say:Your thoughts?In an earlier version of this post the word “TUSH” was presented as an entry in the crossword puzzle. The word “REAR” is the entry and the anagrammed black square letters can spell out the word “TUSH.” Also the word “ERGO” is the entry while “THUS” is the anagrammed black letter spelling. Stop laughing. This is my job.

 1703,  2009, a, On a somber day for General Motors one person was celebrating the automaker’s bankruptcy: the left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore.Mr. Moore who made the anti-G.M. movie “Roger & Me” in 1989 has long decried the company’s plant closings and layoffs — especially in his hometown of Flint Mich. So on Monday he might just as well have been dancing on the company’s grave.In a posting on his Web site Mr. Moore wrote: “It is with sad irony that the company which invented ‘planned obsolescence’ — the decision to build cars that would fall apart after a few years so that the customer would then have to buy a new one — has now made itself obsolete.”But Mr. Moore was just warming up to express his glee over the bankruptcy. Here’s a sample:So here we are at the deathbed of General Motors. The company’s body not yet cold and I find myself filled with — dare I say it — joy. It is not the joy of revenge against a corporation that ruined my hometown and brought misery divorce alcoholism homelessness physical and mental debilitation and drug addiction to the people I grew up with. Nor do I obviously claim any joy in knowing that 21000 more GM workers will be told that they too are without a job. But you and I and the rest of America now own a car company! I know I know — who on earth wants to run a car company? Who among us wants $50 billion of our tax dollars thrown down the rat hole of still trying to save GM? Let’s be clear about this: The only way to save GM is to kill GM. Saving our precious industrial infrastructure though is another matter and must be a top priority. If we allow the shutting down and tearing down of our auto plants we will sorely wish we still had them when we realize that those factories could have built the alternative energy systems we now desperately need. And when we realize that the best way to transport ourselves is on light rail and bullet trains and cleaner buses how will we do this if we’ve allowed our industrial capacity and its skilled workforce to disappear?Mr. Moore’s proposal: Forget building cars and trucks even those that are smaller and more fuel-efficient. Instead Mr. Moore wrote the government should convert the factories of G.M. and other automakers over to producing mass transit.Why? “The products built in the factories of G.M. Ford and Chrysler are some of the greatest weapons of mass destruction responsible for global warming and the melting of our polar icecaps” Mr. Moore wrote.Meanwhile another scourge of G.M. the consumer lawyer Ralph Nader assailed the G.M. bankruptcy and reorganization as “the product of a secretive unaccountable Wall Street-minded government task force.”Like Mr. Moore Mr. Nader deplored the loss of G.M. jobs and the cutbacks in workers’ wages and benefits.But Mr. Nader whose 1965 book “Unsafe at Any Speed” help bring about the demise of the Chevrolet Corvair is also worried about the further availability of liability claims against G.M.“Victims of defective GM products may find themselves with no legal avenue to pursue justice” Mr. Nader said in a statement. “In the Chrysler bankruptcy with complete disregard for the real human lives involved the Obama task force and auto company have maneuvered effectively to extinguish the product liability claims of victims of defective cars.”h/t Business Insider’s Green SheetGo to Blog Post from Michael Moore »Go to Statement from Ralph Nader »

 3970,  1996, a, Dancers often use deliberately distorted or exaggerated movements to make their works emotionally and thematically expressive. Yet "Three" which three choreographers presented on Thursday night at Performance Space 122 remained surprisingly uncommunicative although it was filled with distortion.Claude Wampler's "Geisha Secretia Panda's Glands: A Pheromonol Pursuit" was the piece that came closest to being theatrically vivid. Unfortunately it was also long-winded. As she kept putting on elaborate costumes many of which made her resemble a geisha Ms. Wampler seemed to be trying to act like a femme fatale. Her wiles were often amusing and there was a charming scene in which she dressed a dog as a geisha. Nevertheless the solo was lackadaisical in its pacing.In "I Hear Crows Crying" Yasuko Yokoshi demonstrated that she knows how to create the illusion that she is responding to invisible yet very real presences around her. This solo in which dancing was combined with a film also by the choreographer sought to evoke family memories. Yet watching it was like paging through a stranger's family album.Although strong in stage presence Li Chiao-Ping was dramatically amorphous in two solos "Chi" and "Fin de Siecle" and in "Lattice Cuts" a duet created in collaboration with Sally Silvers. The duet got off to a compelling start when Ms. Silvers laboriously entered clinging to the back wall as if for dear life. Nothing that followed equaled the power of that moment. JACK ANDERSON

 5183,  1989, a, The New York Stock Exchange plans to re-examine its rules for coordinated halts in trading in the market known as circuit breakers John J. Phelan Jr. its chairman said yesterday.The exchange board meets tomorrow when it is expected to announce a series of rule revisions to deal with market volatility. ''We have to revisit the circuit breaker to see if we have adequate ones'' Mr. Phelan said yesterday adding that the re-examination is likely to focus on cross-market circuit breakers which would affect the futures markets in Chicago and the Big Board.''We will probably come out with some short-term things that will speak to the concerns that people have'' Mr. Phelan said of the Thursday meeting. There has been a rising tide of complaints about index arbitrage a form of program trading that is based on differing prices in the stock market and the stock index futures market. But Mr. Phelan declined to be more specific about what changes might be adopted.The exchange has been holding a series of meetings with major participants in the markets in recent days. Yesterday officials met with executives at the top trading desks of Wall Street's largest firms.

 5926,  1983, a, * To the Editor:Your July 26 editorial on the costs of free concerts suggested that they could just as well be held in a stadium. But the reason they are held in Central Park is that people like to be around growing things once in a while.It's a different sort of atmosphere.In theory the park is there to be enjoyed; if it gets damaged you fix it. If funds are not available for music that draws 350000 or more people then what are we all working and building tall glass towers for?Meanwhile who gave Henry Stern the Commissioner of Parks the authority to decide that The Clash (punk-rock group) can't play in the park (news story July 26)?

 1437,  2011, a, Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesThursday’s 11:30 a.m. session at the Bikram Yoga NYC studio in the Flatiron District began as usual: a handful of half-dressed students slowly flapped their elbows as they decelerated their breath and stared at themselves in the mirror. After paying as much as $25 each they began their mindful workouts in the 105-degree “Torture Chamber” while outside on Fifth Avenue pedestrians scurried past in coats.A few blocks away on West 27th Street about 30 pupils soon began the same breathing exercises dripping with sweat in the 103-degree heat. But this class labeled “Traditional Hot Yoga” and offered by the growing studio chain Yoga to the People cost just $8.“Yoga should be for everyone” Matt Hillock a blissed-out wrung-out student said after the lower-priced class.But Bikram Choudhury the millionaire founder of Bikram Yoga believes his kind of yoga belongs to him — he has even copyrighted it. Now he has sued Yoga to the People for copyright infringement seeking monetary damages and asking a federal judge to block Yoga to the People from offering its hot yoga class.“We sent an investigator to take the classes” Robert Gilchrest Mr. Choudhury’s lawyer said on Thursday. “The classes were virtually mirror images and the dialogue was consistently the same.”Despite yoga’s long history Mr. Gilchrest said that Mr. Choudhury had the right to claim his own 26-posture sequence and the instructor’s dialogue.“Words have been in existence since women and men started speaking but you can copyright a sequence of words” Mr. Gilchrest said.The founder of the Yoga to the People studios Greg Gumucio began as Mr. Choudhury’s student. He said the guru enlightened him by saying “You are your own teacher. You are responsible for your own experience.”That led Mr. Gumucio to the realization that high-profile (and expensive) instructors were not necessary for successful yoga study. And in 2006 he opened Yoga to the People in the East Village. Now the chain which also offers its classes in non-heated rooms on a voluntary-donation basis has five studios in New York and one each in San Francisco and Berkeley Calif. and Seattle.Mr. Choudhury’s suit (see also below) filed in California where Bikram is based has a different philosophy — that he is responsible for students’ success. Aspiring Bikram teachers must take his formal nine-week $7000 course. Once certified instructors must obtain his permission to open studios.The suit reported Wednesday by the Manhattan news site DNAinfo calls Mr. Gumucio’s instructors “impostors” and charges that he broke his agreement to follow Mr. Choudhury’s rules.The rivalry has been brewing for some time. In August another Bikram outlet Bikram Yoga Manhattan said it was closing one of its studios because “the presence of our competitors” namely Yoga to the People “has made it impossible for us to continue.”Mr. Gumucio however said he never agreed to abide by Mr. Choudhury’s rules and that was why he split with him.“For almost five years I worked with Bikram was often a guest in his home and he in mine” Mr. Gumucio wrote in an e-mail. “I have never agreed with Bikram and his idea that he owned the yoga or that he should sue anyone.”Mr. Choudhury has taken legal action against imitators before. He is currently suing two other studios for copyright infringement Mr. Gilchrest said and he reached a monetary settlement with a Los Angeles studio in 2003.One regular student of Yoga to the People Diane Pamphile pronounced Mr. Choudhury’s suit “mean.““I’m a student” she said. “We can’t afford expensive yoga classes. I commute from Queens just to come here.” She is one of more than 3000 signers of a petition on the Web site yogatruth.org that defends Yoga to the People’s ability to continue teaching the style.Chelsea Channing Portney 23 a Bikram student for nearly five years said she loves the classes but doesn’t think Mr. Choudhury should be able to claim the poses as his own.“I don’t believe that Bikram should be able to own those moves since they have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years” she said.Still she will keep going to the classes. “While I don’t agree with Bikram I personally love my teachers and the people I have met” she said.Mr. Gumucio said that his sequence of poses is not exactly the same as Mr. Choudhury’s.“I cringe at the thought of the far far reaching ramifications that this lawsuit holds” he wrote. “If the originators of this traditional knowledge had attempted to copyright trademark or own in any way yoga a yoga pose a yoga sequence then perhaps nobody today would have the joy of experiencing yoga.”In a 2007 op-ed in The New York Times the writer Suketu Mehta noted that the United States had issued 150 yoga-related copyrights and called Mr. Choudhury’s legal actions “a gross violation of the tradition of yoga.”“There is a line in the Hindu scriptures: ‘Let good knowledge come to us from all sides’ ” Mr. Mehta wrote. “There is no follow-up that adds ‘And let us pay royalties for it.’ ”

 1235,  2012, a, The past few years of fashion documentaries have rolled out portraits of the talented and fabulous that largely embrace their subjects’ cult of personality and occasionally even talk about their clothes. “A Man’s Story” an unsatisfying look at the London designer Ozwald Boateng was shot over 12 years and aspires to a degree of intimacy yet this glancing treatment is not very enlightening.PhotoThe director Varon Bonicos whirls through Mr. Boateng’s eventful life from his annus horribilis in 1998-99 troubled by a painful romantic breakup and business catastrophes through his rise to a Savile Row shop address and stewardship of Givenchy. Son of Ghanaian immigrants Mr. Boateng worries about spending enough time with his wife Gyunel and their children but hardly ever has a stitch out of place. Mr. Bonicos issues bland updates in voice-over though he also sees fit to confront Gyunel about a suspected affair. (They later divorced.)Mr. Boateng’s stress levels do not make riveting material and his resilience is not joined by illuminating commentary. His suits praised by the likes of Laurence Fishburne and Will Smith are quite the opposite resplendent in snappy colors and smart fits. But Mr. Bonicos trots out musical montages to cover the fashion shows that so occupy Mr. Boateng (now 45) and skips over the nuances and evolution of his style influence or reception.Mr. Vonicos who also contributed to the 2006 TV series “House of Boateng” misses an opportunity to make a feature-length documentary that takes the full measure of his subject’s work.
 4649,  1992, a, These were supposed to be the golden years for Robert Campbell a chance to spend lazy afternoons with his wife pursue his passion for gospel music and develop the bus company he had started as a hobby and a community service into a successful business.It was supposed to be a time when Mr. Campbell would show that hard work and Christian values could allow someone to rise above the filth and crime that had crept into his neighborhood Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn over the last 10 years.Now only two months after Mr. Campbell retired from his maintenance job of 25 years those dreams have been shattered. Last Sunday the bus he was driving to a New Jersey amusement park crashed and burned leaving six people dead. Among them was his wife of more than three decades Allie Mae 57 years old.Yesterday he was charged with six counts of aggravated manslaughter because a New Jersey prosecutor said he knew the bus had faulty brakes when he left for Action Park.

 38,  2019, a, Welcome to the Running newsletter! Every Saturday morning we email runners with news advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.Christie Aschwanden opens her new book “Good to Go: What the Athlete in All of Us Can Learn from the Strange Science of Recovery” with the fact that the word “recovery” has gone from a noun to a verb. I was floored. It so perfectly captured not only what has been pitched to me for years as all the ways that runners can actively make their bodies heal from long workouts but also the unsolicited advice I’ve been getting on how to help my stress fracture heal faster.I recently chatted with Ms. Aschwanden about the meaning of recovery the placebo effect compression socks and the weirdest thing she did while researching her book. Who ever thought someone would try to turn the pain of stepping on a Lego brick into a form of recovery? Answers have been lightly edited.ImageJAM: How did the word “recovery” become a verb?CA: I was a pretty serious elite athlete back in the ’90s and early 2000s. Then recovery was the state of being that you hoped to attain. Now it’s something that people feel like they have to actively do. We’ve let go of this idea that we just wait for recovery. It’s no longer the waiting period between workouts. There’s a sense that if you’re waiting you’re not trying hard enough.

Michelle Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2017 for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to kill himself via text and phone calls. The documentary from Erin Lee Carr (whose father was David Carr a New York Times columnist who died in 2015) explores the troubling context of this Massachusetts case and the legal precedents it set.

We enter into Mandy’s head space via hazy images impressionistic flashes and extreme close-ups as she tries to figure out what happened how she feels and what she wants to do about it.‘Unmasking Jihadi John: Anatomy of a Terrorist’Starts streaming: July 31Why would a mild-mannered Brit become a terrorist?

 6392,  1970, a, Thailand's decision to send volunteer ground forces as well as gunboats and other military aid to Pnom penh may in the short run bolster the shaky Lon Nol regime and help to speed the promised withdrawal of American forces from Cambodia this month. In the long run however this latest extension of the Indo china conflict is more likely to add to the problems of the Cambodians—and the Thais—and to complicate the task of extricating American forces from South east Asia.The Thai move is almost certain to provoke a reac tion from Communist forces already operating inside Thailand and along the long porous Thai border with Laos. It could in time lead to a more substantial extension of the Indochina war to Thailand itself.For the Cambodians this fresh promise of “help” from another traditional foe is at best a doubtful blessing even though it is accompanied by assurances that the helpers will all be Thais of Cambodian descent. The Thai move means a further intensification of the fighting on Cambodian soil with all the destruction and loss of civilian life that entails. It will add weight to the nationalist appeal of ousted Prince Sihanouk who has alrerady gained recruits for his Communist backed fight to regain power as a result of South Vietnam's heavy‐handed intervention on behalf of the Lon Nol Government.It could even lead to the dismemberment of Cam bodia with the Thais indefinitely occupying western areas of the country some of which they have long claimed; with the South Vietnamese taking over effec tive control in the southeastern region where their forces are operating and with Communist forces hold ing firm in the northeast where they are entrenched.

 4574,  1992, a, The tipoff came when the Bush people said the speech would be a "defining moment." That was what they had called the gulf war this time last year -- a "defining moment" -- and now they were recycling it to ballyhoo a speech.They didn't even have any new phrases for Pete's sake. How could they possibly have a new idea? Applying "defining moment" to that perennial brain-glazer the State of the Union speech should have told us how things stood: to wit that this outfit is so sure it's home safe for another four years that it doesn't even feel the need for fresh bluster much less a fresh thought.As if to flaunt his contentment with last year's crowd-grabbers the President addressed the economic recession with the same chilling words he used after Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait: "This will not stand."What does this mean? That the recession is going to get Schwarzkopfed unless it comes to its senses and clears out of America pronto? Of course not. It means "Prosperity is just around the corner."

 4937,  1990, a, A former minor league pitcher of no great distinction is about to make a mark as the first Japanese manager of an American baseball team. His name is Hide Koga and he is the new skipper of the Salinas Spurs of the Class A California League a team that will have at least a dozen Japanese players on its roster when it plays the season opener Friday against the Modesto A's.''What I will teach the young players is to think for themselves like American players'' Koga said of the Japanese players on the team. ''I am going to teach the American players it takes hard work long hours of practice to be a good player.''Koga who played in the San Francisco Giants' and Chicago Cubs' organizations at the Class A level doesn't want to overtax the American players. The Americans are used to practicing just a couple of hours a day instead of the six or seven that Japanese players work. ''I am going to treat American players better than Japanese players'' Koga said. Joe Buzas the Spurs' co-owner said he thought it would be a novel idea to sign the 50-year-old Koga who has held front-office jobs with the Daiei Hawks of Japan for the last 20 years.''He's a very articulate man and he does know what he's doing'' Buzas said. ''If he doesn't we'll get rid of him. He wants to blend the American style with the Japanese style to get the best of both.''(AP)

 6010,  1978, a, SUICIDE which was at CBGB's over the weekend is a two‐man Sick band that has been around for several years but has just now—with most of the leading New York underground bands signed to major labels and distinct signs that people are looking for novelties beyond punk basics—begun to attract attention particularly in Britain.Suicide offers an act consisting of three elements. By far the most interesting are the electronic‐keyboard machinations of Martin Rev who sets up a grinding overlapping texture of ostinatos. Some of those short repeated figures recall primordial rock riffs. But the basic effect is both brutal (largely a matter of the deafening volume) and complexIf that were all there was to it you would have something comfortably in the tradition of Klaus Schulze and the other German keyboard wizards with a strong overlay of the Riley‐ReichGlass sort of motoric energy. But aside from the implied hostility of the vole Suicide offers the contributions of Alan Vega the singer.Mr. Vega's work blends lurid melodrama with the miming of crazed hostility. The vocal sounds come close to screams and are refracted into a kind of aural chamber of mirrors by a heavy admixture of echo and other distorting devices. The song subjects are full of murderous imagery and urban angst.

 2774,  2003, a, The flat beside the cay was an ideal habitat for permit which we could see feeding during the mornings we stayed there their noses searching for crabs in the sand their tails visible above water -- like thin black sails. The tailing permit has been the catalyst of more than one fly-fishing obsession. Certain maniac fly fishers will cast to thousands of elusive permit before hooking one.The first afternoon we went out to other cays and their adjacent flats where I had my first shot at a school of tailing permit. Much as I would like to think of myself as an accomplished angler the sight of these fish with their tails in the air befuddled me. On the first cast I hooked my thigh and drew blood (it was the wind's fault of course) then the guide told me to get into the shallow water and stalk the fish by wading at which point I wrapped the line around my feet and fell overboard with a big splash.The greatest pleasure of any fishing trip especially when the fish get the better of you is when you meet wonderful people. I learned a great deal about the area from my guide Eloy a native of Monkey River village on the mouth of the Monkey River. He gave me a brief history of the Belize fishery.''When I started fishing man all we had was handlines'' Eloy said. ''We called it cotton line. As a kid we caught snook to 30 pounds all the time and one day when the snappers were spawning my friend and I caught 140 averaging 10 pounds. I didn't know what a fishing rod was. The first fly-fishing rod I saw was in 1980. I saw this man in a boat up the Monkey River with his line up in the air. I thought I want to do that thing with the line up in the air.''We made flies with egret feathers. Man those things were killer for snook. The Guatemalans introduced gill nets in southern Belize in 1970. They started using gill nets in Monkey River and Punta Negra. Ten years later they had at least half the fish dead.''Eloy grew up hunting in the forest for jaguar peccary jaguarundi and whatever else he could shoot. He hunted mostly at night and on several occasions was nearly bitten by fatal fer-de-lance snakes. He fished in the sea for snapper lobster and conch. He and his friends kept everything they could get and killed it to eat or sell.Now Eloy is one of the greatest proponents of preserving the native fish and fauna and works closely with the Nature Conservancy to educate people to support the wildlife and become ecotourist guides.''You got to protect the resource man'' he said. ''It's all we got.''In the evening we drank fresh coconut water with gin. Then when it was dark and the wind was down Eloy began his stories of the 70-minute nightmare of Hurricane Iris in October 2001. It is worth the trip merely to hear his story.

 2767,  2003, a, The economic summit that begins today in the French Alps -- the first meeting since the war in Iraq between Mr. Bush and European leaders who opposed it -- is the start of a new effort to revive globalization. It is the annual meeting of the Group of 8 which includes Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan Russia and the United States.Beyond the disagreements over Iraq the United States and Europe have had a number of clashes over trade. Europe for example opposed genetically modified foods and criticized steel tariffs and tax benefits for exporters like Boeing in the United States. The recent decline in the dollar has also made life difficult for European companies that had become accustomed to the effective price edge on their goods while the dollar was higher.After the Évian meeting the next step in the trade talks known as the Doha round will be in Cancún Mexico in September. In Cancún differences over agricultural subsidies and drug patents will be more clearly on display than they are this week as negotiators who have fallen behind schedule determine whether they can meet their own deadline of signing a new pact by 2005.In the meantime officials from the United States and Latin America will continue their fitful discussions about creating a trade zone for the Western Hemisphere similar to one that exists in North America.''All the trade negotiations are in trouble'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. the president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a former trade negotiator. The steps taken during the last decade ''have been so successful that we've gotten down to the final difficult issues.''Bush administration officials take a more positive view saying they remain committed free traders despite their support last year for new steel tariffs and farm subsidies. Officials cite successes in the war on terrorism which they say are removing a major obstacle to the movement of people and goods and recent trade pacts with Chile and Singapore. Those pacts are part of a strategy that Robert B. Zoellick the United States trade representative calls competitive liberalization in which the administration seeks to maintain free-trade momentum even if global talks bog down.John B. Taylor the under secretary of the Treasury in charge of international affairs said: ''You take steps forward and move back. That's always the case.'' Over all he added ''the trends are good.''

 454,  2016, a, Season 4 Episode 12: ‘A Roy Rogers in Franconia’We have not always been kind in this space to Paige Jennings or to Holly Taylor the 18-year-old Canadian actress who plays her. When “The Americans” was balancing its Paige story line (teenager finds out her parents are Soviet spies) with its Martha story line (woman finds out her husband is a Soviet spy) we were solidly on Team Martha — her plot won on dramatic and emotional grounds and Alison Wright acted up a storm as the lonely secretary willing to commit treason for love. (Even if her lover was actually Paige’s bigamous father.)But Wednesday night’s episode “A Roy Rogers in Franconia” (written by the showrunners Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields) forced a reconsideration. Not a total one — we still miss the exiled Martha desperately. But Mr. Weisberg and Mr. Fields through sheer persistence and a radical but deftly handled twist at the end of last week’s episode have managed to make Paige’s between-two-worlds predicament interesting. We finally care about what happens to her and what’s in her head rather than just seeing her as a hyperventilating nuisance who’s putting her parents in danger. And while Ms. Taylor’s range remains narrow it feels as if the character’s evolution toward a kind of resigned fatalism or exasperation has been cleverly tailored.The episode started in the aftermath of last week’s random violence when Elizabeth stuck a knife in the neck of a would-be mugger in front of Paige. At home — where Philip and Henry were happily playing a game of Stargate on the ubiquitous family computer — Paige demanded answers. Was the man dead? Did her mom have to do that? How did she know how to do it? And most tellingly had she done it before? Paige’s parents have denied hurting people — which we know is ludicrous — and now Elizabeth had to roll back one more lie perhaps the biggest one of all. She admitted that she had killed before but added “To protect myself yeah” which seemed arguable. (Though it’s always for the protection of Mother Russia.)The next morning Paige was still digesting what she’d seen and getting a new sense of how dangerous her parents’ work must be if they were trained to do what her mother had done. She was no longer talking about calling the police; she was just trying to adjust her picture of her mother and father to all this new information and insisting on getting even more.
 1744,  2009, a, Good news for Muslims in Malaysia at least those who are fans of the Black Eyed Peas: concert organizers said that they could attend a coming performance by the band after previously stating that the show was open only to non-Muslims Agence France-Presse reported. A Web site for the concert which is being held on Sept. 25 near Kuala Lumpur to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Guinness brewery in Dublin had said that “the party is only open to non-Muslims aged 18 years and above” and Malaysia’s Ministry of Information Communication and Culture had said that Muslims could not attend. Of Malaysia’s 25 million people 60 percent are Muslims; Islamic law forbids the consumption of alcohol. But the concert’s promoters Artists World Entertainment said in a statement that the event was now “open to all individuals aged 18 and above” according to Agence France-Presse. No immediate reason for the change was given though the original plan to bar Muslims from the show drew widespread attention and criticism.

 2721,  2003, a, Amy Sue Rosen and Peggy PeloquinDance Theater WorkshopThe metaphor of the body as a house or landscape is a peculiarly rich one for dance. Two choreographers explored it in different ways in works by Amy Sue Rosen and Peggy Peloquin that runs through tomorrow at Dance Theater Workshop 219 West 19th Street Chelsea.Notes for Ms. Peloquin's new ''Strategies Stabilizing'' which opened the program on Feb. 21 included the poem ''Question'' by May Swenson. What will she do Swenson writes when ''Body my house my horse my hound'' is fallen? The dance does not provide an answer. Instead it juxtaposes a loping sinking meditative woman (Ms. Peloquin) with two other women (Kelly Eudailey and Daniella Hoff) whose bodies complement each other like puzzle pieces limbs conversing precisely under hanging gauze carcasses designed by Matt Gagnon.''Strategies Stabilizing'' is set to music by C. Hyams-Hart. The handsome video is by Peter Richards with lighting by Phil Sandström and costumes by Liz Prince.''Break/Broke'' choreographed by Ms. Rosen with visual designs by Derek Bernstein a painter and longtime collaborator does address Swenson's question. There is nothing to be done this profoundly simple piece suggests about the familiar constants of sickness and death.

 4199,  1995, a, Asked about atrocities attributed to his forces Mr. Taylor said at a news conference today that the course of the war had been set by God."I just believe in the destiny of man being deemed by God and wars whether manmade or what are directed by a force" he said. "And so when I say it is God's war God has his own way of restoring the land and he will restore it after this war."After starting Liberia's civil war in December 1989 with an attack by two dozen fighters who penetrated the country from neighboring Ivory Coast Mr. Taylor messily succeeded in his initial goal of bringing down the dictator Samuel K. Doe a brutal unschooled army sergeant.But a West African peacekeeping force led by Nigeria prevented Mr. Taylor from taking Monrovia and in time the proliferation of other militias each more violent and undisciplined than the last forced Mr. Taylor to content himself with Gbarnga and kept him supplied with enemies. Before war tore the country into separate fiefs Liberians many of whom are the descendants of freed American slaves were relatively prosperous.Another factional leader Alhaji Kromah the leader of the Ulimo Militia which for much of the war was the principal rival of Mr. Taylor's forces arrived at Monrovia's airport today.Ismael Diallo one of the thousands of people who gathered early today to greet him said "I don't support any of these people I only support peace."As bands beat out rhythms on drums and crowds broke into traditional dances Mr. Diallo who said he had lost several family members to the conflict said what many Liberians have been thinking in recent days: "This country has been robbed of its life for six years. Our only hope is that we have come to our senses."

 3864,  1997, a, The ODC/San Francisco modern dance troupe clearly spent a great deal of time and money on ''Outawak'' a spectacular multimedia computer fable that opened on Tuesday for a week's engagement at the Joyce Theater. Dancers spill out across a set-strewn stage dressed in a variety of costumes whose bright colors give the dancers the look of Liquorice Allsorts. There are scrims and screens galore on which are projected bridges a church steeple clouds and members of the cast. And ''Outawak'' is a noble attempt to create a piece for the entire family which seems to be one mission of the ODC troupe.The title says a great deal however about the level of wit in this eveninglong work choreographed by Brenda Way and Kimi Okada to music by Paul Dresher and Bruce Barthol. ''Outawak'' was inspired by the teen-age son of one of the choreographers and by Norton Juster's ''Phantom Tollbooth'' a children's book that shares the dance's tone of cool disengagement. The plot is familiar and ''Outawak'' slips quickly through its points about language and learning. So it's hard to imagine the very young or the more sophisticated young audience finding the piece the solidly entertaining and even provocative theater experience its creators seem to be aiming for.''Outawak'' tells the story of Cosmo a typically tuned-out teen-ager who falls into cyberspace and a series of misadventures in the divided city of Wak. Cosmo is quickly recruited into the B-9 squad a group of resistance fighters seeking to make peace between the forces of Numeragua and Verbia committed respectively to order and logic and to expressive passion. Along the way Cosmo meets Molly XYZ a pretty ferocious member of B-9 and a host of nutty characters with names like Hopping Hindsight Nuances of Narrowness Raging Hormone and Crippling Rigidity several of whom resemble the parents and sisters he left behind. After many chases arrests and melees Cosmo discovers Balance the key to peace and reunites the warring factions.Not all of this is clear. But Daniel Levi-Sanchez who plays Cosmo has a serenity and sweetness that acts as ballast in the storm. The cheerful hard-working cast also included Shannon Mitchell Kevin Ware Patricia Jiron Karina Richter Damon White and Heather Tietsort in lead roles. The sets and lighting were by Alexander V. Nichols with costumes by Barbara Bandy and Estelle Akamine. The film was by Wendy Slick and the slide designs were by Mr. Nichols and Larry Ackerman. Live music including rapping was provided by the Paul Dresher Ensemble Electro-Acoustic Band.

He was 86 years old.Mr. Groves essentially had two business lives. First as a young flashy and successful investor he was involved in several businesses and had controlling interests in several others including the United Cigar Store and the Whelan Drug Store chain. Spent 2 Years in PrisonBut he was indicted in 1938 and convicted in 1941 of using the mails to defraud stockholders in the General Investment Corporation which he controlled. He had been accused of using the mails in a scheme to sell securities to General Investment at an inflated price. Mr. Groves spent two years in Federal prison.Late in the 1940's Mr. Groves became interested in Grand Bahama Island the long narrow strip at the northwest edge of the island group. He bought 114000 acres at $2.80 an acre.
 5022,  1990, a, The Bethlehem Steel Corporation stung by sharply lower steel prices and higher operating costs said yesterday that its third-quarter net income dropped 78 percent. Bethlehem the nation's second-largest steel company also said the level of shipments dropped 6 percent for the quarter.Bethlehem like other leading steel makers was hurt by the widespread price discounting in the industry in the quarter as previously announced price increases failed to stick.The company reported net income of $10.1 million or 5 cents a share compared with $46.9 million or 53 cents a share in the 1989 period. Sales for the quarter declined 4.7 percent to $1.21 billion from $1.27 billion. The third quarter of 1989 included $105 million in charges for restructuring and reducing the size of two of its operations.While price discounting has affected the earnings of several other steel companies Bethlehem has been particularly vulnerable because it has few operations outside of steel. Also Bethlehem is the only big producer that has no joint ventures with foreign steel companies. Underlying Problems
 4944,  1990, a, 'All the Protection'Dexter Lehtinen the acting United States Attorney in Miami replied to Mr. Rubino's charges in a written statement saying: ''Mr. Noriega has been accorded all the protection of due process and right to counsel. Nothing the Government has done regarding illegally obtained assets has infringed on these rights in any way.''Judge Hoeveler said he expected to meet with defense lawyers and prosecutors on Wednesday in an effort to resolve the impasse over General Noriega's funds. He said it was possible that the defense would decide to sue the Government to force release of some of the assets but Mr. Rubino said he had not yet decided on additional steps.Mr. Rubino said Judge Hoeveler had considerable leeway under the law to appoint a public defender or other counsel or if he chooses to force the present lawyers to continue to defend General Noriega. Judge Hoeveler said it would be difficult for a public defender to handle a case that ''will require enormous resources.''The United States Government Mr. Rubino asserted was claiming that all the general's assets estimated at between $20 million and $60 million were profits from illegal activities and therefore were subject to seizure. Mr. Rubino and other defense lawyers strongly disputed the Government's contention.Question of Money's OriginsAt least a portion of General Noriega's assets had been earned legitimately Mr. Rubino contended. He made a point of arguing that some of the frozen assets had come from fees that Central Intelligence had paid to General Noriega over the years for services to the United States Government.Mr. Rubino estimated that charges and expenses incurred in General Noriega's defense had mounted to more than $1 million and he said that defending the general was threatening to bankrupt him. After more than four months of nearly full-time work Mr. Rubino said he and other defense lawyers have received less than $100000 for expenses including travel hotels and secretarial fees.In addition the burden of defending General Noriega Mr. Rubino said has prevented him from taking on several clients whose cases he would have accepted under other circumstances.
 4079,  1996, a, Explaining the NonexistentIf Mr. Nakamura's figures are accurate much of the economic debate of the last couple of decades has been misguided with economists and others trying to explain a decrease in productivity growth and a slowdown of economic growth that either did not exist or was much milder than the official statistics indicated.And if the estimates are right that doesn't alter the fact that the economy has produced quite real anxiety -- that if things are so good how come so many people feel so swamped with bills they can't afford to pay?The very technological leadership and improvement that Mr. Nakamura hails as so important in boosting real productivity and holding down inflation have hurt some industries and their workers while creating whole new ones. For many Americans it has been a period of economic pain as more have gone to work for longer hours just to maintain their living standards. But statistics on the broad economy are supposed to capture averages and it may be that those in pain were not typical.It's likely that the Boskin panel will come up with numbers indicating that inflation was not as severely overstated -- and economic growth not as robust -- as Mr. Nakamura says it was. But it seems clear that the economic stagnation portrayed in years of statistics has reflected flaws in the numbers at least to some extent rather than in the economy.Why do inflation numbers matter so much? In large part it is because the Government like anyone else can only directly measure nominal numbers. You know how much money you made last year and how much you are making this year. But to know what an increase really means you have to adjust for inflation. If the rate of inflation is overstated your real gain will be understated.A percentage point or two doesn't sound like much but over time the effect can be dramatic. It is all the more dramatic if as Mr. Nakamura contends but some doubt the overstatements have been getting worse.Consider the reported decline in real wages. It has led to a debate with some pointing to free trade as a destroyer of high-paid American jobs and others pointing to excessive Government regulation. But Mr. Nakamura contends that real hourly wages rose by an average of 1.45 percent a year during the 21-year period. That is not as rapid a gain as the 1.6 percent of the previous decade but there would have been less hand-wringing had the Government reported increases.
 2098,  2007, a, ATHENS Ga. — He is on the cover of the Oklahoma State media guide and he is scooting through the Georgia defense for big plays. N.F.L. scouts are watching him from the edge of their seats. He has been called the best player in the Big 12.What’s his name?The public address announcer in the Georgia press box says he is AdariusBrown. He is actually Adarius Bowman the Cowboys’ 6-foot-4 wide receiver whohad four catches for 65 yards in the first half Saturday night. After halftime adjustments we’re sure Bowmanwill become his name again.More important than the announcer is what kind of adjustments Georgia will make. Bowman lines up in the slot and attacks the middle of the defense. He draws linebacker help which creates space for tight end Brandon Pettigrew who had three catches for 26 yards in the first half.It makes you wonder. Tennessee lost its three best receivers and the Volsare searching for a playmaker. Bowman is from Chattanooga. He is not a late-bloomer having been rated the fourth-best player in the state in high school. Tennessee simply didn’t get him. He went to North Carolina and was suspended forviolating team rules and then transferred to Oklahoma State.We’ll see tonight when Tennessee plays Cal but the Vols could use a guy likethis. So could some N.F.L. teams. Watch this guy. The ball is onthe way his hands are at his side the defensive back doesn’t know theball is on the way and Bowman reaches up and snatches it.The Cowboys are good. A lot of weapons a hurry-up offense that can catch teams off-guard. This is a dangerous team that might just be 8-4 because of schedule that has them playing at Texas A&M Nebraska and Oklahoma.

It also made the 52-year-old Andretti the oldest man ever to win an Indy-car pole. The only official laps faster than the one by Andretti yesterday came in May during the Indianapolis 500 qualifying when Roberto Guerrero had four laps faster than 232 miles an hour. (AP) GOLF Morgan Chips to LeadGil Morgan after a three-hour rain delay used a 20-foot chip-in to resurrect his game and took the lead yesterday midway through the rain-shortened second round of the Canon Greater Hartford Open in Cromwell Conn. Morgan was struggling but birdied two of his final four holes to move to six-under-par 64 2-under for the day. Kenny Knox the first-round leader and Billy Ray Brown the defending champion were tied with Morgan at 6-under and will resume second-round play this morning.

 1626,  2009, a, NEW ORLEANS — It is one thing to get the Alabama fans mad at you. It is quite another when the Alabama attorney general is mad and has the power to throw you in prison.Andre Smith the Outland Trophy winner has been suspended for the Sugar Bowl for what multiple news media outlets are reporting was improper contact with an agent. The Alabama attorney general’s office is investigating because the state has strict laws regarding sports agents and contact with amateur athletes. The offense is considered a felony.The story broke Monday when Coach Nick Saban announced Smith’s suspension and it did not take long for the Alabama attorney general to assign an investigator. Some news media outlets are reporting that a member of Smith’s family talked to the agent.The N.C.A.A. said it was not involved in the investigation and the university was handling the probe. That should not surprise critics of the N.C.A.A. who claim the governing body of college athletics has lost its teeth when it comes to chasing bad behavior by its members.This is bad news for the agent involved for several reasons. One is jail time and a hefty fine. Also consider that Alabama is going to have a slew of N.F.L.-type players in the program the next few seasons with Saban chasing the best of the best in recruiting. If an agent is responsible for Smith getting suspended it is likely that agent and his agency will not have a chance at these Bama players.The last time Alabama had to play a game without Smith its all-American left tackle the Crimson Tide stumbled around on offense and beat Tulane 20-6 in the third game of the season. Bama rushed for 130 yards. Alabama not only played without Smith who led one of the best offensive lines in the country it also played without right guard Marlon Davis. The sophomore David Ross will start against Utah at left guard and Mike Johnson will move from left guard to left tackle.Smith by the way told The Birmingham News he had not decided whether to turn pro or return for his senior season. Considering the life expectancy of knees in college football and the N.F.L. it is hard to believe Smith will not turn pro especially if he is projected to go in the top five of the 2009 draft as many expect.

 4482,  1993, a, A Montana paleontologist and his colleagues believe they have found red blood cells in the fossilized leg bone of a Tyrannosaurus rex and say they have high hopes of extracting DNA from the dinosaur's cells.The discovery of the putative dinosaur blood cells has not yet been submitted to a scientific journal or independently confirmed but was reported two weeks ago by the National Science Foundation which has financed the exploratory project. Jack Horner a paleontologist at Montana State University who directed the investigation said in an interview yesterday that his group hoped to find matches between gene fragments left in the preserved blood cells with comparable DNA segments from modern crocodiles or birds."If we're lucky enough to find matches" he said "they could go a long way toward showing what the relationship between dinosaurs and birds might be. We're not there yet but we think we're getting close."The femur or leg bone that Mr. Horner's group is studying is part of an unusually well-preserved tyrannosaur fossil more than 65 million years old which they found and excavated from the Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana three years ago. The apparent blood cells were discovered by Mary Schweitzer Mr. Horner's graduate student who was investigating the cell structure of fossilized bone and marrow tissue. New Climate of Belief

Nor mally orders for patrolmen to work in plainclothes require the approval of the Police Commissioner himself which rarely can be obtained in less than three days.Also in the interest of greater versatility patrolmen in radio cars in the sector will be allowed to park their cars and move about on foot. Under ordinary circum stances policemen assigned to radio cars are never al lowed to patrol on foot.Except for the trip to the pharmacy the business of the team's first day in action fol lowed a normal police pat tern.

Once that happened as Barnes said giving Connors his first-round birthday bash was "a no-brainer."He added "What would you do?"Even the Open which Jimbo ruled last year when he rolled like Old Man River into the semifinals did not go so far as to extend the first round over three days just to accommodate Connors.

 1046,  2013, a, PhotoSociety news was a longstanding feature of the European edition. Reports on the high society of capital cities often filled several pages. Stationed at popular resorts during the holiday season the Herald’s reporters told colorful tales of elegant festivities and sporting events.While mostly frivolous by nature the society columns reveal interesting facets of social change. In February 1909 for example the Herald’s correspondent told of “the roller-skating craze” that has “spread all over London from Whitechapel to Mayfair.”“Everybody seems to have gone ‘rinking’ mad from duchesses to costers. Dozens of rinks have sprung into being like mushrooms but the biggest and most important is in the enormous structure called Olympia made famous years ago by Barnum and Bailey’s circus.”The story ran under pictures of high society figures and contained the usual list of patrons “prominent either by their titles or because they are theatrical celebrities.” But the writer picked up on a new phenomenon:“It is interesting to see how democratic English people can be when they are victims of a fad. At these rinks grand ladies and shopgirls are all on the same level both socially and physically as they glide around. You can’t tell them apart.”On the rink there might have been no constraint or embarrassment but it would probably have been a very different story if the “grand ladies and shopgirls” had met in a ballroom…

The invitation sent jointly by Disney and a development company called the Shanghai Shendi Group does not say more than that. A Disney spokeswoman declined to give more information.Qilai Shen/European Pressphoto AgencyA consultant working on the project said the company and Chinese officials would formally announce the beginning of construction on Shanghai Disneyland which is expected to cost $3.7 billion to build and expected to open by 2016.Disney wants to make Shanghai Disneyland into a megaresort on a par with Walt Disney World in Florida. But the initial phase will be more modest: a “Magic Kingdom-style” park with a castle surrounded by themed areas like Tomorrow Land two hotels a shopping district and a lake.The park will include replicas of well-known Disney rides including Space Mountain and It’s a Small World along with and new attractions based on Chinese history.“It will be the Disney that people know but with a very strong Chinese cultural presence” “said the consultant who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with Disney.

 5807,  1985, a, Check-In Arrangements. Almost all airlines have special check-in counters for first-class passengers at major airports. Most also have a private lounge that is either exclusively for first-class passengers or also used by dues-paying members of the airline's club. Drinks and snacks are available there often free and you can relax or do paperwork until your flight is called.Aboard the Plane. On jumbo jetliners first-class passengers generally board last and are the only ones permitted into the first-class compartment which usually is just behind the cockpit or on some 747's on the upper deck. On smaller aircraft however economy-class passengers must sometimes pass through first class to get to their seats.First-class passengers are seated two abreast often with pairs of seats on each side of the cabin for a total of four across compared with 9 or 10 across in the economy class of jumbos. On short domestic flights however the first-class compartment may be so small that cigarette smoke from the rear seats may disturb nonsmokers to the front.On long-distance flights first-class seats usually recline to an angle of 50 to 62 degrees with about five feet between rows; often legrests are also provided. (On the Concorde a narrow-body jet that carries only 100 passengers the seating configuration is tighter but a trans-Atlantic trip takes only three and a half hours. On trans-Pacific flights of Philippine Airlines the upper deck of the 747 has 14 beds. Japan Air Lines has five berths on some trans-Pacific flights - but not from New York - at a 20 percent surcharge above the first-class fare.) Pampering begins as soon as the passenger is seated often with a glass of Champagne. (Air-India for example has one attendant for every four first-class passengers.) A hot towel may be provided as well as a pair of slippers eyeshades and maybe even a robe on long flights. Gifts include chocolates on Qantas and Swissair and Swedish glass objects on Scandinavian Airlines System. Most airlines also distribute a gift deemed appropriate to the flight which on T.W.A. may mean an overnight kit with toiletries for eastbound trans-Atlantic flights and a business portfolio with a calculator and stapler for those going westward. A recent Alitalia overnight kit for men included cologne a comb and nail file in a case tubes of bath gel and shampoo a bar of soap in a plastic case a hand towel a disposable razor shaving cream a sewing kit and a ballpoint pen.Food and Beverages. The menu given passengers in Aer Lingus's Golden Shamrock service which is what the company calls its first class says ''Togha gach bi is rogha gach di.'' As translated from the Gaelic by Patrick M. Hanrahan the company's public relations officer in New York it means ''The best in food and drink to you'' - which is what airlines like to discuss most when promoting first class.The longer the flight and the more competitive the route the more elaborate the food and drinks. Most airlines stock the major premium brands of spirits and soft drinks often with local specialties such as Irish whisky on Aer Lingus and aquavit on S.A.S. They also usually stock fine wines and Champagnes or the local equivalent. (On Saudi Arabian Airlines however expect superb Arabian coffee and soft drinks but in accordance with Islamic law nothing alcoholic.) If time permits meals are served course by course usually with fine china glassware and silverware. To illustrate how elaborate the menus can be the following was a recent dinner selection on Swissair between New York and Geneva: hors d'oeuvres; Caspian Sea caviar; consomme with cheese toast or cream of chicken soup; salad; sirloin steak with bearnaise sauce pork chop with vegetables or fillet of sole and scampi with shrimps; potatoes or rice and a choice of vegetables; assorted cheeses and fruits; cheesecake or strawberry ice cream with liqueur and double cream; coffee and liqueurs and Swiss chocolates.Arrival. First-class passengers usually leave the plane first and their checked baggage which typically is loaded last is removed first. This gives these passengers a decided headstart on domestic flights but on international arrivals they have to go through customs and immigration procedures just like anyone else unless they are important enough in their own right to warrant special treatment. They get a headstart on other passengers from their flight but could find themselves at the end of a line of passengers from flights that arrived earlier.Hotel Offerings. Some airlines offer first-class passengers a free or reduced-rate night at a hotel upon arrival at their destination or while awaiting a connection. Some offer it only to connecting passengers who cannot get their next flight until the following day. A creative travel agent on request may be able to arrange for you to miss a same-day connection if you would like to linger overnight in London for example.

 2035,  2007, a, If you’re a political junkie with Internet access looking for cheap laughs — and if you’re reading this column you probably are — take a minute go to YouTube and search for “Nixon” and “Rove.”Your query will yield a 1972 CBS news segment on Richard M. Nixon’s reelection campaign. At the four-minute mark — not long after a passing mention of “an electric paper-shredding machine to destroy secret campaign documents” located “just out of sight” at Nixon headquarters — we meet the soft-cheeked thick-sideburned 21-year-old Rove. Already the director of the College Republicans Rove speaks with evident polish touting the campaign’s youth outreach effort.However amusing the interview with Rove (done by Dan Rather) the operative’s role in Nixon’s 1972 organization — the one that brought us Watergate — is more than a curiosity. Rove has recently found himself in legal peril again this time alleged to have sought to politicize the non-partisan General Services Administration along with scrutiny for his part in the firings of eight United States attorneys. The reminder of his roots in Nixon’s anything-to-win political machine is telling.When George W. Bush became president the smart money pegged him as Ronald Reagan redux. Bill Keller now the executive editor of The New York Times persuasively laid out the case in a nearly 8000-word piece for the Sunday Magazine titled “Reagan’s Son.” The two men he pointed out had similar political agendas in cutting social services and taxes on the rich and projecting American military power abroad. They also shared a management style establishing their administrations’ big picture while delegating details.In his ideology and his policies Bush’s debt to Reagan has been borne out. (Conservative purists back in the day even accused Reagan as they do Bush now of betraying their principles when he became unpopular.) In other ways however — Bush’s political style his attitudes toward executive power and his contempt for democratic procedures — it has been clear for many years now that his real role model is Nixon.The resemblances could fill a magazine article as long as Keller’s. Both Bush and Nixon resentful of the supposed cultural dominance of liberals perfected a conservative populism that vilifies academics journalists bureaucrats and other professionals as out-of-touch elites. Both men hostile to the news media rigidly prescribed the messages that their staffers could take to the press. Both vaunted secrecy restricted access to information and politicized areas of the government once deemed the province of non-partisan experts.Iraq has generated even more echoes of the Nixon years. In a book review in The New York Times recently Michiko Kakutani said it was hard to read Robert Dallek’s new tome “Nixon and Kissinger” without regarding it “as a kind of parable about the presidency of George W. Bush and its determination to stay the course in Iraq.” Regardless of whether you agree that Iraq resembles Vietnam Bush has certainly used the pretext of being a “war president” to justify curtailing civil liberties expanding presidential power and demonizing dissenters — as Nixon had. Claiming national security threats without furnishing the evidence to prove their claims both men also illegally wiretapped Americans.Interesting as the parallels are however the Nixon presidency matters to the Bush presidency less as an analogue than as history. Nixon’s was not simply a species of presidency similar to Bush’s but was the soil from which the Bush presidency grew. Rove’s dirty tricks matter in other words because they establish a direct lineage between the anything-goes mentality of the Nixon White House and the hardball of the Bush administration.It’s been widely reported for example that Rove’s mentors in the College Republicans during the Nixon years included dirty-tricks maestros Lee Atwater and Donald Segretti. Newspapers have also reported that in 1970 Rove sneaked into the campaign headquarters of a Democratic candidate for state office in Illinois filched campaign letterhead and sent out fake fliers aiming to discredit the Democrat. In my own research on Nixon I discovered that during Watergate itself Rove used a phony grassroots organization to try to rally Americans to the president’s defense against what he called “the lynch-mob atmosphere created” by “the Nixon-hating media.” And according to Nixon’s former counsel John Dean the Watergate prosecutor’s office took an interest in Rove’s underhanded activities before deciding “they had bigger fish to fry.”Rove moreover is hardly the only link in the chain. Indeed his youth outreach effort of 1972 had some success. A whole generation of conservative activists came of age in the 1970s either working for Nixon or more commonly voluntarily defending him on campuses and in political circles. His shame was their outrage.These young conservative activists essentially endorsed the line that Nixon put out during Watergate— that “everybody does it.” They agreed that the president had to resign only because a double standard prevailed in the media and in Washington. Nixon’s dirty tricks his efforts to politicize the civil service and discredit the media and his willingness to use executive power for personal and political gain were really no cause for indignation. They were politics as usual.“Frost/Nixon” a new play about Nixon’s 1977 interviews with the British talk-show host David Frost recently came to Broadway. Appropriately enough it stars the former Dracula Frank Langella as Nixon. In the drama as in the real-life interviews with Frost Nixon’s most memorable line came when he said: “When the president does it that means that it is not illegal.” Audiences roar at the comment. But they do so I fear only because they are hearing it spoken by a delightfully hammy Langella amid the opulence of a Broadway theater.

The others remain at large the police said.Mr. Peterson did not enter a plea at his arraignment yesterday before Judge Herbert J. Adlerberg. Mr. Peterson was arrested in Brooklyn last week on an unrelated charge that was later dropped.Judge Adlerberg set bail for Mr. Peterson at $20000.

 4940,  1990, a, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders have tentatively agreed to extend New York State's sales tax into a broad new area - the service industry.The sales tax is also expected to be applied to magazines which now enjoy special exemption and to telephone calls made to 900 numbers.But under the agreement the details of which were still being worked out today the bulk of the new revenue would come from extending the sales tax for the first time to services like custom computer programming management consulting public relations and cleaning services. $500 Million in New Taxes The new sales taxes it is estimated would be worth almost $500 million a year. The budget is expected to total $50 billion and legislators are looking for ways to fill a budget gap that is estimated to be as high as $4 billion.Business lobbyists who have bitterly opposed the plan to expand the sales tax say it represents a major departure from the state's longstanding policy of limiting the tax to tangible goods and to services that result in tangible goods like film developing. They say they are concerned that the new sales taxes could crimp New York's service industry which has been the fastest growing segment of the state's economy.

 3591,  1998, a, Immokalee a town of about 20000 people in southwest Florida with one of the biggest and poorest labor reserves in the state sits in sharp contrast near wealthy municipalities like Naples. Tomato pickers in Immokalee say all production costs have gone up except their pay with growers covering their higher costs by saving on pickers.Depending on the time of the picking season which runs from September to May workers can make as much as $100 a day or as little as $30 they say but by year's end most of them average a salary of $8000 to $10000 well below the poverty level of $13300 for a family of three. That is enough for a life style of crowded housing conditions often in trailers with no telephone no car and no meat on the table most days. There are no health vacation or pension benefits either.Pressing their case through the Coalition of Immokalee Workers a grass-roots group with about 750 members the tomato pickers are seeking an average raise of 20 cents a bucket to 60 cents which they say would have a negligible impact on tomato prices. They also want to end a practice called ''day and a dime'' which pays a flat wage for the day plus 10 cents per 32-pound bucket picked. Coalition members say that the system encourages workers to pick more but that at the end of the day it pays less than the piece rate.''Our focus is to restore our salary to the equivalent of what it was 20 years ago -- that's 20 cents more per bucket'' said Lucas Benitez 22 a former picker who now works for the coalition. ''We're not asking for an increase or any benefits.''Last year 2000 workers signed cards supporting the coalition's call for a raise. In December 700 to 1000 workers participated in three one-day strikes a calibrated action that is used sparingly because most workers cannot afford to miss a day's pay. But only one grower has even acknowledged the workers' request to meet.That grower Gargiulo Inc. one of the biggest agreed to raise the pay per bucket by 10 cents to 50 cents over the next year an action the coalition says shows that its salary demand is one growers can afford. Gargiulo and other tomato growers in the area contacted for comment did not return telephone calls.Mr. Gilmer of the growers' group said a recent survey of tomato growers in the area showed workers making $6 to $12 an hour with the average worker making $8 to $9 -- higher than the national average for farm workers of $7.31. But coalition members counter that the figures are inflated and that the implied annual salary more than $16000 for a 40-hour week 52 weeks a year is not representative because picking is not a regular job. If the growers wanted to pay workers an annual salary the coalition says pickers would gladly accept less like $15000.
 2147,  2007, a, Hillary Rodham Clinton got a reminder in Iowa today of just how divisive the issue of immigration is –- on both sides of the ideological spectrum. She drew a lusty chorus of boos from advocates of laws permitting illegal immigrants to become citizens as she spoke at the Heartland Forum a Democratic presidential forum organized by a collection of community groups here.It happened as Mrs. Clinton was pressed on whether she was prepared within the first 100 days of her presidency to push through legislation that would give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. The question drew applause.“I have been in favor of a path to citizenship for years” Mrs. Clinton said according to a transcript provided by Radio Iowa. “I voted it in the Senate and as president comprehensive immigration reform will be a high priority for me.”She drew a scattering of applause but her questioner pressed Mrs. Clinton about whether she would do that in her first 100 days.“You’ve got to get the Congress to pass the legislation” she said talking over boos from one corner of the room. “The president can do as much as possible which I will do.”

 5104,  1989, a, ''People are of the perception that minorities raise third-generation hoodlums that people have no dreams and no goals'' said Gina Smith a Schomburg tenant who works as an office systems analyst.Instead say the people who live here they are struggling to bring up responsible children and proud to live in a community they see as stable. On a salary of $34000 Earlean B. is raising two children of her own and two nieces she adopted after their parents abandoned them. She pays $850 a month for her four-bedroom apartment and sends her children to private schools. It is so hard she said that she worries when one of her sons starts to cough because she knows she cannot spare the $50 to get him to a doctor.''You're working you're trying to make a living'' said the school worker who is trying to get her youngest daughter into a private school. ''Anyplace else you go it's the same - you can't run away from it. When I go out I take my kids with me but you can't always keep them. When they go downstairs you never know what will happen.''The people who live here complain about brazen drug dealers poor recreational facilities for their teen-agers inadequate police protection. But many others in the neighborhood say they would not move anywhere else. They say they enjoy their proximity to Central Park good public transportation and a strong sense of community.''I don't think anyone here has lived in fear'' said Sylvia Sadler a 45-year-old mother of two children who has lived in Schomburg Plaza for 13 years. ''We are a close-knit community. If we need something we can go to our neighbors. We want the same things for our kids as you do. I want a good education I want them to work and strive and be the best they can be.''This is not a community people here say that should be branded with the images of poverty fear and despair. There are several low-income projects in the neighborhood and graffiti mar some of the buildings. But there are also several moderate-to-middle-income apartments like Schomburg where with a federally subsidized mortgage tenant rents range from $375 for a studio apartment to $664 for a four-bedroom apartment.There are tree-lined streets where tulips bloom and garbage cans sit in tidy rows near brownstones under renovation. According to police and census data the neighborhood is not plagued either by sky-high crime rates or wrenching poverty.

 4153,  1995, a, Financial fire fighting and economic coordination are supposed to be specialties of the Group of Seven as the consortium of the world's biggest industrial nations calls itself. But on both counts the recent record of these nations -- the United States France Britain Germany Italy Canada and Japan -- is looking less than impressive.Indeed some economists believe that its impact is in the process of being eclipsed by a lesser-known body of industrialized and developing nations which scored an economic success last week as the Group of Seven produced another disappointment.At their annual spring session in Washington last week finance ministers of the Group of Seven's member nations fell out over the Clinton Administration's indifference toward a weak dollar with many complaining that turbulent currency markets are endangering world recovery.Helmut Kohl the Chancellor of Germany had set the tone before the talks even started by saying American policy was "not acceptable." Lawrence H. Summers an Under Secretary of the Treasury hit back in an interview published with the Handlesblatt newspaper just after the talks by accusing the Germans of "always saying no." Lamberto Dini Italy's Prime Minister and Finance Minister termed the meeting "tense."

 3449,  1999, a, As an adult Ms. Lord has kept Golf Cottage a small 19th-century house across a road from the nine-hole golf course on the Winterthur property. She asked her father to leave it to her instead of the large house he built to move into when the mansion became a nonprofit museum in 1951.On a low butler's table in the tiny living room was a florist's arrangement of flowers that Winterthur's publicity agent had had sent for the interview. ''I didn't get around to tearing that up'' she said.''I like everything plain'' she said asked about a handful of fresh daffodils in a teacup on the windowsill. ''The furniture? It's nothing. Most of it came from Lord & Taylor.''If objects tell stories for all of the magnificence of Winterthur Mr. du Pont's relationship with his daughter was thinly furnished -- a man with 58 sets of china who recorded in detail his table settings for lunch and dinner for 50 years but found it hard to choose words for his children.''He almost never spoke'' said Ms. Lord who worked with archives at Winterthur and cases of correspondence to construct her parents' half of her childhood. ''He was a very sort of kindly person but he was not intimate.''As is clear to a visitor Mr. du Pont saved much of his affection for things.''After my father died there was an Oriental rug that wound up in Connecticut in my house which I thought was very pretty'' Ms. Lord said. ''One day I noticed that sewn into one of the corners which said 'Albany' -- that was my room -- was 'When Miss R. E. is in residence.' That was me. Ruth Ellen.'' Her father had what he considered ''an inferior rug'' Ms. Lord said put down when she was expected home. ''Obviously my father had a terrific distrust of children and he thought I was going to ruin everything so the good stuff was apparently moved out when I was there.''Golf Cottage was empty when Ms. Lord was a child at Winterthur. She went there with her nurse to row on the pond and catch tadpoles. As a girl she sat inside to smoke cigarettes ''with pals'' as she put it.
 5816,  1985, a, The way Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sees it the only thing wrong with the little teddy bear holding a minature basketball net and wearing a uniform bearing the blue and gold Los Angeles Laker colors is its name - Kareem Abdul Jabear. The pun according to Abdul-Jabbar who receives no royalites from the enterprise violates his rights to exploit his own name and injures his marketability.Accordingly the Laker star has filed suit in Federal court in Los Angeles against North American Bear Inc. the company that markets the Jabear bear. The Laker center who is seeking unspecified damages as well as an injunction halting sales of the bear is believed to be the first celebrity to object to being the model for one of the company's line of Very Important Bears. Since Barbara L. Isenberg a New York designer started the V.I.B. line it has included such bears as William Shakesbear Zsa Zsa Gabear Douglas Bearbanks Queen Elizabear and Bjorn Bear. Mrs. Isenberg who was also named in the lawsuit could not be reached for comment yesterday.

 1138,  2012, a, A citizen journalist in Syria who has been instrumental in assisting those covering the conflict in Homs helping evacuate wounded journalists from inside the city’s neighborhood of Baba Amr has been seized and perhaps tortured by the Syrian government an activist told CNN on Saturday.The citizen journalist Ali Mahmoud Othman was the head of the media center in Homs according to CNN and was thought to be at a secure military unit in Aleppo added the activist who requested anonymity for security reasons. “We believe Ali is being subjected to severe torture” the activist told CNN. “The lives of our activists and citizen journalists across the whole country are now at risk.”William Hague the British foreign secretary said in a statement that he was “very concerned” about the treatment of Mr. Othman. He has called on Syrian authorities to release Mr. Othman and other political prisoners “immediately.”Activists cited the apparent detention of an essential cog in the “citizen journalist network” as the latest example of President Bashar al-Assad’s crackdown against journalists trying to chronicle the bloody conflict.CNN said that the media team that worked with Mr. Othman in Baba Amr issued a statement placing “full responsibility on the Syrian Assad regime for any harm caused to the journalist Ali Othman.”On Sunday Sen. John McCain of Arizona released his own statement on the reports of Mr. Othman’s detention:There are credible and troubling reports that the Syrian journalist Ali Mahmoud Othman has been detained and is being tortured by Assad’s forces. This courageous man has risked his life repeatedly to tell the story of the Syrian people and he put himself in harm’s way to help get wounded Western journalists out of Syria. The world must unite in calling for the immediate release of Ali Mahmoud Othman as well as every other Syrian prisoner of conscience being held by Assad.He also posted a message on Twitter.Got reports that Syrian journalist Ali Mahmoud Othman is held & tortured by Assad forces- world must call 4 his release mccain.senate.gov/public/index.c… — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) April 1 2012Heather Blake the United Kingdom’s representative for the journalist watchdog group Reporters Without Borders told CNN on Saturday that the Syrian authorities were “systematically targeting journalists working inside Syria and particularly local journalists and the media centers that have been set up.”At least eight journalists have been killed while covering the conflict since November according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Five were killed in February including Marie Colvin a correspondent for The Sunday Times of London.

 306,  2017, a, WILD NIGHTSHow Taming Sleep Created Our Restless WorldBy Benjamin Reiss305 pages. Basic Books. $28.The night before I stopped sleeping I slept. This is something I try to explain to any well-meaning person who asks about my mysterious pigheaded yearslong case of insomnia. It came on abruptly. It was precipitated by no crisis I could discern. It was not the culmination of many years of poor or varied sleep. One day I simply closed my eyes and nothing happened. It was as if I’d been poisoned.Whenever a self-help book about sleep crosses my desk I toss it. I already know what it says. Not getting enough: Bad. Pills: Avoid. Sunlight: Essential. But when I saw Benjamin Reiss’s “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World” I lunged for it and it wouldn’t surprise me if my fellow travelers in exhaustion had the same response. Certainly strangers reacted favorably to Reiss while the book was still in progress. As he writes in his epilogue: “Something about becoming the Sleep Guy seems to have made me a magnet for interesting divulgences and unusual conversations.”Most people even those who sleep well have at least one story about a brutal cage match with Morpheus.What makes “Wild Nights” so liberating is that it is descriptive not prescriptive. It does not hector. It barely engages with the science of slumber at all. It aims rather to describe the social history and evolving culture of sleep — through literature (Reiss is an English professor at Emory University) through ethnographies through old diaries and memoirs and medical texts.

 1758,  2009, a, As a special segment in this week’s music popcast we revisit the Beatles’ White Album which friends with good ears have proclaimed the most exciting restoration work in the newly remastered Beatles catalog. Is it a great record though? (Come on: be honest.)Our guest is Nik Cohn author of books including “Triksta” “The Heart of the World” and a pioneering rock critic who tore a strip off the White Album in a review for The New York Times [pdf] published in December 1968. Back then at the age of 22 a Briton in love with street culture and disenchanted with the encroachment of high-art aesthetics into pop Mr. Cohn felt that the Beatles were a rugged little group who’d gone soft. Jeering at its narcissism and lack of direction he called the White Album “boring almost beyond belief.” He hears more in it now but he’s still not particularly impressed. I try to hang on to my affection for it. And what do you think?

 2493,  2005, a, Readers respond to David Brooks’s Dec. 1 column “The Age of Skepticism“:Maureen Scott Kansas City Mo.: I feel obligated to respond to the following portion of your latest column in the context of the Great Depression: “As the Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman has observed Americans begin social reforms when they are feeling confident not when they are weary and insecure.”At the depths of the Depression social reforms took priority . . . To say that the nation was feeling confident at that time would be a misnomer. It took the overwhelming will of a strong leader Roosevelt to keep on message about the positive nature of our nation to set reforms in motion.What we lack right now as a nation is a strong leader who we can rally around. I see no such persons in our political parties that are ready to step up to this challenge to overcome partisan politics and do what is necessary for the future of this nation. THAT is what makes me weary and insecure. We need another Lincoln to overcome the divides and remind us what this country was founded upon.Ted Brown San Francisco: Your essay today provides an interesting bookend to your piece on the unappreciated heroism of our troops.The common theme in both it seems to me is one I’ve seen in a lot of political writing in the past 10 years. In different ways for instance both E.J. Dionne and Christopher Lasch have discussed the retreat of Americans from responsibilities outside of their own property lines their own private circle of concerns. Is it any wonder that the exurbs are a popular attractive residence destinations for millions of Americans? A place where the evils of the world like poverty and disease and war are kept at bay or at least vicariously experienced through violent video games a place where personal dreams and ambitions are fostered without much care for civic or patriotic sentiments and habits.What should our government do given these circumstances? I think in part this willed personal isolation explains the appeal of current conservative politics to so many Americans — the idea that governance is somehow a problem not an essential part and positive good of any civilization. In a subtle way it’s an easy step to see civic obligations and patriotic sacrifice as part of the evils of government. After all don’t such sensibilities force us to connect with our political institutions? And this is why this administration has failed in its leadership it has neither asked nor inspired the majority of Americans to commit to the war on terrorism or in day-to-day terms to drive an economy car instead of an S.U.V. because we need to save our resources to win this war.Michael Koplow Woburn Mass.: It is not as bad as you suggest. It is a question of leadership in this country and as you well know but seldom state our leaders in Washington under this administration are woefully unqualified to manage the country’s affairs.Why not state the obvious reason for such skepticism in the U.S. the incompetence of the current administration. If we get capable leadership the public’s skepticism will evaporate.Paul Corning San Francisco: One of the most significant social changes in my lifetime happened with the transition to Ronald Reagan’s presidency.If I remember correctly it happened not at a time when Americans were feeling confident but at a point of near despair over our economy and our power in the world. Reagan’s reforms pale in comparison to FDR’s which were larger and were attempted during far more difficult times.It is pain and fear that encourages us to change. Unfortunately we probably have a lot of both ahead before we get serious about change.Steven Campbell Oakland Calif.: While I agree with Mr. Brooks that we are living in a time when the American people view their government with equal measures of skepticism and cynicism I am once again disturbed by his unwillingness to put much of the blame where it belongs — the Republican Party.While I agree that the Democratic Party is far from blameless the Republicans have practically made cynicism their political strategy. After 9/11 President Bush had the opportunity to put his money where his mouth was and actually be the uniter he claimed to be. Unfortunately he instead squandered national unity and resolve on partisan political goals putting party before country.When politicians clear cut trees in the name of healthy forests or weaken air pollution controls and call it clear skies is it any wonder that the American people are cynical?Tim Potter Oceanside Calif.: You are right on the money when you say that the American public is skeptical about the U.S. government’s ability especially this Bush administration to ‘solve the deep problems that are rooted in history and culture.’This skepticism was cured on Vietnam and Watergate. I disagree that it leads or will lead to passivity. If a person is let down enough by a situation or others long enough they figure out eventually that they can not rely on that situation or persons and that they need to take matters into their own hands. The most successful people throughout history have not waited for anyone to give them permission to realize their dreams.I submit that what is happening now is a new awakening where people are seeing behind the veil of illusion that government as it is now solves our problems initiates change or meaningfully effect our lives.Albert Sayers Pound Ridge N.Y.: There is one component you missed in your essay about cynicism and that is honesty. I have heard you over and over again say that how we got into the war is over and how we are going to go forward is what matters and so let’s go.Yes We need to move forward. But people understand when they have been deceived and that is how they feel now. They know there were no W.M.D.’s especially nuclear ones that scared us all to death. They know the occupation was bungled but they hear the administration saying the insurgents are in their last throes. If the administration did not lie about W.M.D. and it was the intelligence that was bad they want to know why the president gave the head of the C.I.A. a medal! . . . It just does not add up.On Sunday Sen. Warner said the president should have a fireside chat like Roosevelt did. What made those chats work is that when he told you what was going to happen and why the facts unfolded to support his statements. That builds trust. Misleading the people leads to cynicism.Lastly when you treat people who disagree with you . . . with contempt you are in fact saying you have contempt for the system that gives them their voice in the first place. . .

 4283,  1994, a, Nationalist Serbian forces stepped up activity on several fronts today apparently using heavy weapons moved from Sarajevo to mount a fierce attack on the besieged city of Maglaj and to resume shelling Tuzla and its airport.Although the United Nations-brokered cease-fire in Sarajevo has been generally holding there were indications that it was beginning to fray. The United Nations spokesman here Lieut. Col. Bill Aikman said this morning that there had been reports of machine-gun and small-arms fire in several areas and a number of sniping incidents in which at least one person had been killed in the city and four had been wounded.The United Nations command said Serbian forces drove six tanks out of the "exclusion zone" imposed around the city on Feb. 21. United Nations officials said the tanks had been hidden in the zone in clear violation of the week-old ultimatum from NATO.The situation at Maglaj was so desperate that the Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic called a news conference tonight to warn that "there is great risk the city will fall."

 1423,  2011, a, David Goldman for The New York TimesWhen Jon S. Corzine joined MF Global last year it seemed like a strange choice — the firm had none of the glamour let alone the profits or footprint of Goldman Sachs the bank he ran during the 1990s.On Wall Street it was as if a manager of the New York Yankees was making a comeback in the minor leagues.Mr. Corzine 64 who not only presided over Goldman but later served in the United States Senate and then as governor of New Jersey seemed surprised himself.“Don’t ask me any hard questions” he joked to a visitor who met with him just days after Mr. Corzine took over in March 2010. “I hadn’t heard of this company a week ago.”Now nearly everyone has.MF Global a commodities and derivatives brokerage house collapsed on Monday in the biggest bankruptcy on Wall Street since the failure of Lehman Brothers. The firm imploded after a big investment in European bonds — a bet he directed and defended as not particularly risky as recently as last week — led investors clients and ratings agencies to lose confidence in the firm.The fall of MF Global and the discovery that hundreds of millions of dollars were missing from the firm’s customer accounts have now cast a dark cloud over Mr. Corzine’s legacy and reputation. Federal authorities have stepped up an inquiry into why the firm failed to keep its customers’ money separate from the company’s — a regulatory violation.MF Global was supposed to be Mr. Corzine’s comeback vehicle after New Jersey voters turned him out in 2009. Instead the collapse of the firm appears to be a humiliating coda to the career of a one-time titan of Wall Street.His insistence on taking more risks including buying the debt of European countries like Italy and Spain along with a contract that would have provided him with an additional $12.1 million if he left the firm paint a picture of excess.And Mr. Corzine with a fortune estimated at half a billion dollars at its peak did not confine his future ambitions to Wall Street. Even as he was seeking to revive his financial career Mr. Corzine a Democrat had long styled himself as a financial executive moving seamlessly between Washington and Wall Street in the mold of former Treasury secretaries like Robert E. Rubin or C. Douglas Dillon.With MF Global’s bankruptcy that goal seems forever out of reach. It has also taken a big toll on a man known for the kind of optimism that comes naturally to experienced traders and political leaders.Six weeks ago Mr. Corzine journeyed a few blocks from the firm’s Midtown Manhattan office to the Hilton Hotel for a routine presentation to money managers. Mr. Corzine’s manner was anything but routine however.“He looked like he had just seen a ghost” said one participant. “He looked visibly disturbed.”Mr. Corzine could not be reached for comment.Friends say this is one more humiliation in a career marked by painful public ousters whether it was from the executive suite at Goldman or from Drumthwacket the New Jersey governor’s mansion.“That’s part of the tragedy here” said Robert G. Torricelli the former Democratic senator from New Jersey whose political career was also cut short. “Jon is very proud and this must be exceedingly difficult. You can lose an election and not take it as personally because it’s a reflection on issues and trends. But this is obviously different: all eyes are on him. It’s one thing to make financial misjudgments and to pay the price yourself. But it’s another when institutions are damaged.”Mr. Corzine’s arrival seemed like a coup for MF Global when it hired him as chief executive. MF Global has been a leading player in brokering trades in commodities and derivatives like futures contracts.But MF Global had the potential to be more than a brokerage firm Mr. Corzine thought. When he was at Goldman that firm had bought a commodities trader in 1981 J. Aron & Company which was encouraged to take more risks and became a huge success.Mr. Corzine replaced old-line traders and brokers with more aggressive hires from Goldman Sachs UBS and Soros Fund Management.In May 2010 in his first investor call as chief executive of MF Global Mr. Corzine discussed what could go wrong at the brokerage firm as it ratcheted up risk. “It will be mistaken judgments” he said “that go beyond limits which I don’t intend to allow happen.”Yet despite his confidence in risk management Mr. Corzine’s message to traders was clear: Take more risks. “He was instrumental in pushing our firm forward with risk taking in every book whether it was U.S. government bonds currencies or in repos” said one trader. “Everything was full throttle go.”European sovereign debt looked especially tempting. Instead of the near-zero yields on United States Treasury bonds short to medium Italian and Spanish bonds were earning 2 to 3 percent. Simply holding those to maturity and collecting the yields would buttress profits as other businesses shrank.And while most Wall Street firms sharply ratcheted down their use of leverage MF Global continued to pile on large amounts of debt. On the eve of its collapse it had about $34 of debt for each $1 of capital it held according to data from Keefe Bruyette & Woods. By contrast Goldman Sachs’ leverage ratio is $13.50 for every $1.The combination of potential losses on the European debt and the MF Global’s thin capital cushion is what spooked investors setting off the crisis. MF Global’s demise was the eighth largest bankruptcy in the country’s history but with $41 billion in assets it was considerably smaller than Lehman which had assets of $691 billion.For those who have followed Mr. Corzine’s career however the problems at MF Global have elicited a strong sense of déjà vu.In 1994 Mr. Corzine ascended to the top of Goldman Sachs despite hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses at the bank’s bond unit which he had overseen. He assumed leadership of Goldman say his former colleagues in part because he was one of the few partners who understood how to extricate the bank from its soured trades.Mr. Corzine a lifelong trader with a large appetite for risk recently reflected on his past experiences dealing with crises in William D. Cohan’s book “Money and Power How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World” a recent history of the bank.“Until you’ve actually traded and had to deal with one of those come-to-Jesus moments with a bad position” he said “and you have to make the decisions about whether to eliminate it hold it reduce it — those kind of existential moments involving the people you work with and your firm those are the kinds of things that really get your attention.”Mr. Corzine’s worldview had been forged at Goldman where he spent 24 years. After growing up in a farm town in Illinois where he was captain of his high school basketball team Mr. Corzine armed with an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago joined Goldman Sachs in 1975 as a bond trader. Bond trading was then low on the totem pole of Goldman. But he gained notice making big bets — and generating big profits — trading government bonds. At the age of 33 he made partner.As Goldman’s senior partner from 1994 to 1999 he led the bank through the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. His crowning achievement was Goldman’s initial public offering in 1999 though the controversial move led to a power struggle that ultimately cost him his job.In 1998 he also drew the ire of his Goldman partners for discussing a merger with Mellon Bank without conferring with the firm’s management committee a misstep that also contributed to his being replaced by Henry M. Paulson Jr. who later became secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush.Upon leaving Goldman Mr. Corzine turned his attention to public service spending a sizable chunk of his fortune — more than $100 million — to pursue political office.After being elected to the Senate as a Democrat from New Jersey in 2000 Mr. Corzine distinguished himself in Washington for his financial acumen. But he viewed himself as more of an executive than a legislator and decided to run for governor in 2005 before completing his term.Mr. Corzine’s one term as governor was marked by difficulties. He complicated his run for governor by divorcing his wife of more than 34 years shortly before announcing his candidacy and was dogged throughout his time in office by complaints that his romantic relationship with a leader of state employees’ union left him in an untenable conflict of interest.His first year in office he presided over a weeklong government shutdown when the legislature originally balked at his proposal to increase the sales tax. The next year he was badly injured in a car accident when his speeding state vehicle crashed. Mr. Corzine a passenger who was not wearing a seat belt endured months of difficult rehabilitation that aides and critics said drastically affected the rest of his term.Working at MF Global Mr. Corzine’s life has revolved around Manhattan; he is rarely seen in Hoboken where he keeps an apartment. Last year he married Sharon Elghanayan the former wife of K. Thomas Elghanayan a New York real estate developer.National politics remained a focus of Mr. Corzine after he joined MF Global. He pitched in to help raise money for President Obama — who had campaigned for Mr. Corzine during his re-election bid for governor.Mr. Obama’s first major re-election fund-raiser in New York was held at the Manhattan home of Mr. Corzine’s wife with tickets going for $35800 each. And Mr. Corzine was one of the president’s most elite bundlers supporters who tap friends and business associates to bring in checks: He has helped Mr. Obama raise more than $500000 this year.When White House officials sought to broker a meeting between disgruntled Wall Street executives and Mr. Obama’s new chief of staff this year they turned to Mr. Corzine who organized a sit-down at the Four Seasons. Mr. Corzine was on the list. There had even been talk of his being named the next Treasury secretary.Now instead of a big job in Washington Mr. Corzine faces difficult questions about what happened on his watch and whether he should have returned to Wall Street at all.“He wanted to be back in the game” said one old friend. “He thought he could make it work.”Reporting was contributed by David Chen Nicolas Confessore David Kocieniewski Ben Protess Susanne Craig Andrew Ross Sorkin and Eric Dash.
 1367,  2011, a, Chris Trotman/Getty ImagesThe transcript of Juergen Klinsmann’s introductory news conference on Monday reads like “War and Peace” but we’ve pulled out some of the big picture ideas that were discussed. The complete transcript is available at ussoccer.com.Klinsmann on the state of the team:“I don’t think there is anything wrong with the team. They lost a Gold Cup final against a very very good Mexico team that over the last couple of years became one of the top 10 teams in the world and have a lot of talent. When you come into a situation like this you analyze every individual player the team itself and the program which I’ll have the chance to do during the next couple of weeks to see how I can develop them further. You build on what was built before and if you look back on the past 20 years in this country a lot has been built.”On his coaching philosophy:“Having played abroad in different countries Italy France and Germany I have my own ideas for the program. And I will step by step introduce the ideas that I have always double checking if it suits the American game. I’m not coming in here to be the European guy. I’ve lived here for 13 years so I think I know a lot about certain issues. But I think you can also be proud of what you’ve achieved over the last few years where soccer is now.”On soccer in the United States:“I deeply believe that soccer in a certain way reflects the culture of a country. Having studied the U.S. culture over the last 13 years it’s quite a challenge. You have such a melting pot in this country with so many different opinions and ideas floating around there. Every coach obviously has his own ideas and then you have the whole challenge of youth soccer in this country being based on a very different model than anywhere else in the world. Your educational system is completely different than the rest of the world. One of my challenges will be to find a way to define how a U.S. team should represent its country. What should be the style of play? Is it more proactive and aggressive a forward-thinking style of play? Or is it more reacting style of play? That comes with the players that you have at your disposal but also the people that you are surrounded with and the people that have an opinion in this country like the media like coaches. There’s such a wealth of knowledge in this country.”On settling on a particular style and building from the grass roots up:“If you talk about Brazil you know how Brazil plays. You know about Argentina you know about Italy. They sit back and wait for one mistake and if you do they’re going to kill you. We defined that with Germany in 2004 which was a very difficult process but we worked through that process and now it’s settled that style of play. Your opinion is important. College coaches’ opinions are important. Youth coaches’ opinions are important. Everyone is involved in that process players as well. I’m looking forward to a lot of talks.”On his roster for the Aug. 10 game against Mexico which will be announced Wednesday:“I spoke to about five six players over the weekend. We were extremely busy to get this whole thing organized and get officially ready to work and move forward towards the Mexico game. I spoke to five or six players and I will call the rest tomorrow.”On building a coaching staff:“I won’t confirm a full time staff over the next couple of months because I want to see what’s out there. There are a lot of good highly qualified coaches in the U.S. that I might not know. I need to talk to people and understand what’s out there. We’ll talk to a lot of M.L.S. coaches and get their perspective and see who I can invite as guest coaches guest assistant coaches. I won’t come in and say this is my staff.”“I had a great conversation with Claudio Reyna and I want Claudio very close to me in terms of helping him in his new role as a Technical Director for Youth Development at the Federation. He will always be a part of the staff and he will sit with us coaches at the table so I can tell him how I look at the game and how I can be of help to him. I spoke to Tab Ramos. I want his perspective and I want his information about what’s coming through in the Under-20 and U-17 level even if I have seen some of those games already and I kind of already know most of the players from watching them but I will take my time.” “One of the fascinating topics we will have over the next months and years is what people can we work with on a global basis? That doesn’t mean you bring in an assistant coach from Europe just to have an assistant coach from Europe but maybe you have some people in Europe that help to work with the U.S. Soccer Federation and they live in Europe. You have the case that probably two thirds of your squad of the best 20 players are in Europe so maybe a thought is ‘Should we have somebody in Europe to oversee those players so I don’t have to fly back and forth every weekend?’ ”On growing better American players:“What is really missing compared to the leading soccer nations around the world the first 10 to 12 nations around the world is the amount of time kids play the game. If you have a kid that plays in Mexico 20 hours a week and maybe 4 hours of organized soccer but 16 hours of unorganized soccer just banging the ball around in the neighborhood but if he gets up to 20 hours it doesn’t matter how he plays it with his dad or with his buddies in the street this will show later on with his technical abilities with his passing with his instinct on the field and all those things and I think that’s certainly an area where a lot of work is ahead of us.”On the expectations for the U.S. team:“Expectations are always based on what was built over the last 10-15 years. When you coach Germany the expectations are to be in the final. Other than the final the country is not happy. I think expectations here certainly are different because of how the game grew in the last 10-20 years. I think a quarterfinal is already huge. I think going through the group stage is really really important and then going to the knockout stage where anything is possible. But obviously you want to improve you want to get better you want to be better than the last World Cup and the World Cup before but you can’t promise anything because once you’re in the knockout stage anything can happen.”U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati on the reasons he has long pursued Klinsmann:“Juergen’s experience both as a player and coach and as a resident of this country – and I think all three of those are important – we think are huge assets. The latter solves whatever we think about having an international coach and whether they’ll know America and know the difference between Duke (University) and the Portland Timbers and all the things that are specific to the U.S. like the role of education geography and so on.”Gulati on his past negotiations with Klinsmann:“Between [Juergen and I] there has never been an issue of control. I think that’s a bit of a red herring. Juergen’s comments previously were about being able to incorporate that onto a piece of paper. The understanding that we’ve had about moving forward and collaborating quite frankly has been pretty clear for many years.”Klinsmann again:“I reached a comfort level with Sunil where I really think it’s not about a paper anymore.”Most of the U.S. players have been silent since their statements thanking the departing Bob Bradley but here’s one one from Landon Donovan on Klinsmann via ESPN.com’s Scott French:“I have the benefit of having played under Juergen a little bit [while on loan in early 2009] at Bayern Munich and I think one of his biggest attributes is just his positive energy and I think he brings real excitement and good energy and I think that’s going to be really helpful for our guys.”Corner kick: Did you like what you heard from Klinsmann on Monday? Or how about this: Are you willing to trade disappointment in the short term (read: 2014) for progress and a stronger foundation built around some of the developmental ideas he laid out on Monday?

 1097,  2012, a, ISTANBUL — Which is scarier: a government that hunts down and kills dozens in cold blood or a government that hunts down and kills dozens by accident?Left Reuters; Jamal Nasrallah/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOn Thursday Turkey admitted to being the second type of government just as over the last few months Syria has demonstrated itself conclusively to be the first. Turkey’s mistake which it acknowledged sheepishly was to launch air-strikes on Wednesday against about 35 men hiking along unmarked trails between Turkey and Iraqi Kurdistan. The Turkish military says it thought the men were terrorist members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (P.K.K.). But evidence found near the corpses suggested a more benign activity: the men were smugglers evading onerous Turkish and Iraqi customs duties on diesel and tobacco at the official crossing point of Habur. They carried Kools not Kalashnikovs.In the past Turkey’s Kurds have responded to incidents like this one by protesting in the streets and public squares with a little bit of armed struggle from actual terrorists on the side. Last night in Istanbul Kurds and their allies went to the streets. On Istliklal Avenue in Beyoglu district in central Istanbul at street corners normally reserved for upper-class shoppers in winter chic riot police stood huffing into their hands to chase away the cold waiting for violence that never came. But news agencies reported that in the country’s predominantly Kurdish southeast crowds threw stones and Molotov cocktails and stores were shuttered for the day.After violence in the southeast recriminations and confrontations like these are common. But there’s a notable change of vocabulary this time. Whereas Kurds once looked to the West and patiently tried to master the human rights language of the European Union now at least some of them are looking south to the more urgent and concrete language of protest movements in the Arab world. And in adopting that rhetoric the Kurdish leaders are making missteps.“A leader who kills his own people has lost his legitimacy” Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in September. Now Selahattin Demirtas the Kurdish member of parliament who heads the Peace and Democracy Party finds Erdogan’s words delicious. “Now I say the same thing back to him” Demirtas said. “This was no accident: it was a massacre.” Demirtas whose party is the sole legal political voice of the Kurds in Turkey these days said he considered the killing caused by Wednesday’s air strike to be an Assad-level crime.It’s a preposterous and self-discrediting comparison: Erdogan and Assad resemble each other in little more than their mustaches. The first people to acknowledge the differences between the two should be the Kurds themselves: Erdogan’s government has in many ways improved upon the nationalist Turkish governments of yesteryear and the Kurds of Syria have always suffered far more grievously than the Kurds of Turkey. In the P.K.K. camps of northern Iraq Syrian Kurds are overrepresented — the result of especially zealous oppression by the Assad regime.It’s hard to begrudge a movement as aggrieved as the Kurds’ this moment of hyperbole. But let’s hope that the Kurds will reconsider their annexation of Arab Spring analogies. A movement that has spent the last couple of decades mastering the art of patience shouldn’t now sideline its own cause with a faulty comparison to a more desperate one.

 2489,  2005, a, An 85-year-old man was found dead in his apartment in Parkchester the Bronx yesterday morning in what the authorities said might have been a case of carbon monoxide poisoning.The man identified as James A. Atkinson was found dead at 10:49 a.m. in his sixth-floor apartment at 2051 St. Raymond Avenue where he may have died as many as two days earlier the Fire Department said. Two residents on the floor above him were taken to Bronx Municipal Hospital for carbon monoxide inhalation the Fire Department said. Their conditions were not released yesterday.The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of Mr. Atkinson's death the police said.Mr. Atkinson was a retired postal worker who had worked in Harlem. Neighbors said Mr. Atkinson was a kind man who ate pancakes and sausage at a nearby Burger King every morning and was known for being impeccably dressed but that he frequently complained of being cold in his apartment and was known to boil water to try to make it warmer.The Fire Department said the carbon monoxide levels in the apartment were far above safe levels. A sign on the building posted by the management Parkchester South Condominiums said it was exempt from a law ordering carbon monoxide detectors because the heat was piped in from another building. Carol Abrams a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development said the case was under investigation. Officials and neighbors said a gas stove might have been the source of the fumes.
 158,  2018, a, Despite Mr. Trump’s tweet that he has a “much bigger & more powerful” button than Mr. Kim the fact is there is no button.There is however a football. Except the football is actually a briefcase.The 45-pound briefcase known as the nuclear football accompanies the president wherever he goes. It is carried at all times by one of five military aides representing each branch of the United States armed forces.Inside the case is an instructional guide to carrying out a strike including a list of locations that can be targeted by the more than 1000 nuclear weapons that make up the American arsenal. The case also includes a radio transceiver and code authenticators.To authorize the attack the president must first verify his identity by providing a code he is supposed to carry on him at all times. The code often described as a card is nicknamed “the biscuit.”In his 2010 autobiography Gen. Henry H. Shelton chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the final years of Bill Clinton’s presidency wrote that Mr. Clinton had lost the biscuit for several months without informing anyone.“That’s a big deal” General Shelton wrote “a gargantuan deal.”The president does not need approval from anyone else including Congress or the military to authorize a strike — a decision that might have to be made at a moment’s notice.
 2667,  2004, a, KABUL Afghanistan Oct. 31 - Militants holding three foreign United Nations staff members in Afghanistan released a videotape on Sunday showing their hostages and they said the three would be killed if demands for the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of foreign troops were not met by noon Wednesday.The video delivered to the Arab news network Al Jazeera and broadcast Sunday morning was the strongest indication yet that the group Jaish-e-Muslimeen or Army of Muslims was holding the hostages as it has claimed and was adopting the media-oriented tactics of kidnapping groups in Iraq.The three hostages -- Angelito Nayan a Filipino diplomat and two women who are election workers Annetta Flanigan from Northern Ireland and Shqipe Hebibi from Kosovo -- were seized Thursday from their car on a busy street in Kabul. They appeared unharmed but drawn in the video sitting together against a wall. They were guarded by a militant with a black-and-white checkered scarf wrapped around his face.Leaders of Jaish-e-Muslimeen issued their conditions in telephone calls to news agencies on Sunday. They demanded that the United Nations and the United States and other foreign nations withdraw their forces from Afghanistan that all of their Muslim prisoners in Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay Cuba be released and that military and police operations to find the hostages and their captors be halted.

 3497,  1999, a, Allan Carr the producer behind the popular movie musical ''Grease'' and the Tony Award-winning Broadway hit ''La Cage aux Folles'' died on Tuesday at his home in Beverly Hills Calif. He was 62 and also had a home in Palm Springs Calif.The cause was liver cancer Ronni Chasen a longtime friend said.In a varied career that included stints as a publicist and manager Mr. Carr was noted for his shrewd timing and keen nose for new talent. He was perhaps just as renowned for his penchant for camp most notably as the producer of the 1989 Academy Awards telecast. That show's opening number featured a squeaky-voiced Snow White singing ''Proud Mary'' with the actor Rob Lowe prompting legal action by the Walt Disney Company.A party-giver par excellence who favored ''large-man caftans'' during the 1970's Mr.Carr once feted Truman Capote in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.Reared in Highland Park Ill. Mr. Carr attended Lake Forest College and entered show business after studying briefly at Northwestern University. His first venture was as one of the creators of the Playboy Penthouse Television series which helped pave the way for Hugh Hefner's Playboy clubs. He was also responsible for the opening of the Civic Theater in Chicago where he underwrote ''The World of Carl Sandburg'' with Bette Davis and Gary Merrill; Tyrone Guthrie's production of ''Mary Stuart'' starring Eva Le Gallienne and Tennessee Williams's ''Garden District'' with Cathleen Nesbitt and Diana Barrymore.

 3765,  1997, a, ''The only people who did not lose money were those who couldn't put their hands on any'' said Mr. Prushi. ''There were people who sold their houses others sold their cows and now their children don't even have milk.''Mrs. Rinxhi reached for the cigarettes she started smoking again when the crisis began her eyes filling with tears. ''We are in a terrible situation'' she said. ''It can't be worse.''Today Mr. Xhaferri is in jail his fund seized by the Government; Marta the woman who ran the local Xhaferri office collecting wads of leks -- the Albanian currency -- from people who spent hours waiting in line has disappeared. And the people of Fushe-Kruja a shabby dusty town of 25000 responded last weekend by joining the rest of the country in street demonstrations which in some places have turned into near-riots.Thrown on the defensive the center-right Government of President Sali Berisha has promised to restore at least some of the missing money to the people on Nov. 5 to be distributed through savings account passbooks and options to bid on state property. The Government has also lashed out at its already feeble opposition and has blamed opponents for fomenting the violence last weekend.But here where the demonstrations were peaceful residents insist that the Government is to blame for the catastrophe that has befallen them. Like many others they are waiting to see if President Berisha fulfills his promise. ''We want our money'' said Mr. Prushi. ''We don't want pieces of paper.''Fushe-Kruja like many small towns in this nation of 3.5 million was a relative late-comer to the national craze which by October of last year had reached frenzied levels. By then funds like Xhaferri were stepping up efforts to collect more money opening new offices promising ever higher rates of return over ever shorter periods of time -- all signs that the bubble was about to burst.But when Mr. Xhaferri came here nobody really wanted to ask him hard questions like how he could promise to triple their money in three months in a country with meager investments and 20 percent unemployment.

 3091,  2001, a, Guess who I saw online last week in the first-class smoking room on the A-deck of the Virtual Titanic? Leonardo DiCaprio no less. He was standing with his back to me contemplating a blazing hearth a brandy in one hand an unlighted cigarette in the other. When he turned I noticed he wasn't wearing his costume from the movie ''Titanic'' -- just jeans and a Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt under a life jacket.''Gotta light?'' he asked.Leonardo happens to be my own private little nicotine dream. But the first-class smoking room of the Virtual Titanic is open to all -- on the Internet. It was in this room that the rich and powerful Edwardians were enjoying cigars and nightcaps when the liner collided with the iceberg in April 1912. Ask your search engine to seek ''Titanic Online Virtual Titanic'' and you can be there too. Using special software (to be downloaded at the site) you can pan tilt and zoom around taking in the carved mahogany paneling with mother-of-pearl inlay the lofty stained-glass windows and the glowing fireplace.(The cabin and tourist classes had their own smoking rooms down below but I always go first class. If you can no longer smoke I tell myself at least do it in style.)For someone like me a recovering nicotine fiend who once smoked in the shower (through a hole in the curtain -- don't ask) virtual smoking rooms are the only retreats still allowed (unless you count obvious places like Bette Davis movies). It's been five years since I stubbed out my last cigarette and I have no idea where to find a serious public smoking room these days. At least not in New York which now seems to be the Street-Smoking Capital of the World.
 1993,  2007, a, The ever-controversial Linda Hirshman had an article in the Washington Post this past week in which she depicted American women voters – and suburban stay-at-home moms in particular – as politically ignorant disinterested and ultimately self-defeating.Citing studies and anecdotes culled from a few conversations with Washington-area suburban moms who appear to spend a fair amount of their time sitting around on their living room sofas and reading People magazine she painted a rather damning portrait of women who don’t read newspapers don’t read up on policy and very often get their information on the outside world from their more tuned-in working husbands. Ignorant of the issues they cast their votes based on such slippery stuff as “character” and then in election after election blow their chances of being “the decisive force that will elect someone who embraces their views.”Women are not “rational political actors” Hirshman writes. “Instead they vote on impulse and on elusive factors such as personality.”Some of what Hirshman has to say is unfortunately true. Survey after survey shows the consumers of news today to be disproportionately male. In my own anecdotal forays through the living rooms of America’s suburbs I’ve often been struck by the degree to which women – particularly mothers of young children – don’t keep up with world events.The reasons are quite obvious – for stay-at-home moms in particular who don’t have the excuse of in-office dead time to read the paper or browse the Internet there are just no free moments in the day. But however understandable the phenomenon the results can be worrisome. Hirshman cites a recent Pew Research Center study showing that nearly half the women surveyed said they “sometimes do not follow international news because of excessive coverage of wars and violence”; a New York Times/CBS poll last year found that nearly 10 percent more women than men still believed that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. In an age when Americans are showing a troublesome tendency toward irrational belief (There were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; there were dinosaurs on Noah’s Ark) keeping up at least minimally with the news probably ought to be a prerequisite for the job of childrearing.That said while Hirshman’s statistics on female ignorance of the news are worth note her conclusions about women’s particular irrationality as voters truly miss the mark. These days all voters vote “irrationally” – if such factors as personal appeal and character can be said to be irrational.Just look at the presidential election results of 2004: a solid majority of voters said they disapproved of George Bush’s handling of the war and the economy. Most voters furthermore said they believed the country was headed in the wrong direction. But 70 percent of voters also rated the president as “likeable.” They overwhelmingly said they’d rather have a beer with him than with John Kerry and would be much more likely to trust him to walk their dog. No matter where he was on the issues Kerry’s “personality gap” just couldn’t be breached.Look at how John Edwards feels the need to fuss with his hair; how pundits worry that it’s his temper and general bonkers factor – not his anti-choice or pro-war votes – that will prove John McCain’s undoing. Character personality “likeability” as the pollsters put it – they’re huge issues for voters now in particular for the swing voters who don’t have strong ideological leanings. Regardless of gender.“It’s sort of the same thing that makes us believe celebrities are one of us” Sherry Bebich-Jeffe a senior scholar of policy planning at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles told me. “When we see these people in our living rooms all the time it’s as though they are among us and then it becomes important for us to feel we can relate to them. We all tend to vote on personality. Women are no different than any other voters.”In fact last October in the run-up to the Congressional midterm elections another New York Times/CBS poll found no significant difference between the percentages of men and women who cited “personal qualities” as the main reason they were supporting their chosen candidate for the House of Representatives.Singling out women voters for alleged soft thinking is misguided and a little bit bizarre. It reminds me of the arguments used historically by the French left to deny their countrywomen the vote. The ladies the leftists said were much too close to their village priests; hence a vote for a woman was a vote for irrationality – and of course a conservative candidate. (This worked; French women didn’t get the vote until 1945.)Hirshman’s disdain for the way many women live their lives today shouldn’t lead her to underestimate their cognitive skills – or overestimate those of their spouses. Our country may well be sliding towards idiocracy (to borrow from the title of Mike Judge’s recent dystopic) but it’s not just a girl thing.

 5074,  1989, a, New York on the evidence of ''New York Stories'' is a place of magical coincidences a place where the most daring dreams of wealth ambition and psychic well-being can come true. It's a place shaped by success which can take many forms. It is for instance the kind of place where Woody Allen Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese might join forces to make a film together simply because they are Woody Allen Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese.Each of them has contributed a short film to ''New York Stories'' and each of the films in some way presents its director's vision of this city's unlimited possibilities. For Mr. Scorsese whose ''Life Lessons'' is about the way an artist's work and his obsessive love affair commingle the romance of New York springs from its boundless capacity for fostering creativity and rebirth. For Mr. Coppola whose ''Life Without Zoe'' is about a latter-day little Eloise who bestows chocolate kisses on a homeless man and considers this a marvelous gesture the city's glamor is rendered in terms of empty glitter.And for Mr. Allen whose ''Oedipus Wrecks'' is the delight of this collection New York's amazing openness is its salient quality. Mr. Allen's New York is a place where if one's mother were up in the sky above Columbus Avenue telling embarrassing stories to everyone who could hear her the people on the street would be happy to answer.''Oedipus Wrecks'' the last of the three films and the one most worth waiting for features Mr. Allen as a lawyer named Sheldon Mills who still has a lot to fear from his mother. She (Mae Questel who nags with great style) is the type of woman who might just show up in her son's office unannounced waving the program from ''Cats'' and saying loudly of one of Sheldon's partners ''This is Bates the one with the mistress.'' She's a mother who tells her son's fiancee (Mia Farrow) ''You know his father may he rest in peace was completely bald too.'' When Sheldon objects that he isn't bald his mother insists ''You will be.''

 2193,  2006, a, Readers respond to Thomas Friedman’s Mar. 1 column “Who’s Afraid of a Gas Tax?“Sherm Gallay Lee N.Y.: Can you get a voting majority of Americans to make a deliberate sacrifice which directly affects their pocketbooks? I would like to hope so but I don’t think so. Your pro-tax stump speech is compelling and accurate but I don’t think it will have broad appeal.You know there is one easy cost-free way to immediately reduce fuel consumption — enforce speed limits. A vehicle traveling at 65 miles per hour gets 10-20 more miles per gallon than one traveling at 75 m.p.h. In most states I’ve driven through the cops will give you about 10 m.p.h. over the limit before giving a ticket.Now if national leadership were to request that the states strictly enforce the speed limits but not change them there would be a quick and lasting reduction in fuel consumption. Would the American people go along with this rather painless proposition? I wouldn’t bet on it. Of course there would have to be real national leadership to even try it.Tom Sandusky Spring Hill Fla.: You cannot just propose a huge gas tax. Most people live from paycheck to paycheck. It has to be an integrated approach. First the government has to announce that a gas tax is going to be imposed increasing a small amount per year until you get to a target year in order to give people a chance to adjust. Second along with the increase in gas taxes the government has to increase fuel efficiency standards to help offset the cost of higher taxes.Sam Uretsky Wantagh N.Y.: The importance of developing alternative energy sources can’t be overstated but is a gasoline tax — ultimately a retrogressive tax — the best answer? People with the highest incomes could easily ignore it and continue to drive Hummers. People with low incomes might be unable to afford to buy an alternative fuel vehicle and be penalized. I’m uncertain whether any suitable alternative vehicles are currently available for handicapped conversion. Using tax policy as the prime mover of public policy simply seems like an inappropriate approach.I don’t have an all-purpose solution but a combination of inducements might help. Perhaps an initial tax break could be offered to corporate fleets using alternative fuels along with specifications for alternative fuels to be used in government vehicles at all levels. As these cars enter the used car market they would be more affordable for lower-income individuals thus permitting a gasoline tax to operate in a more equitable manner. Conversion kits might be made available for cars now on the road to permit increased use of biodiesel and gasohol without the need to buy a new vehicle. Increased subsidies for mass transit would also be a plus.It’s a national shame that we didn’t listen to President Carter when he developed an energy plan but perhaps this time we’ll learn.Michael Siteman Agoura Hills Calif.: I agree with you that by raising the tax and therefore creating higher gasoline prices at the pump we create a commercially feasible environment for proliferation of alternative fuels. My only concern regarding increasing the gasoline tax is that the government especially the current administration will squander the additional revenue.Frank Auer Stratford Conn.: You seem to have little concern for the poor and middle classes that have to drive and can’t afford hybrid cars. I drive 60 miles a day for work and others I know would really be hurt by a gas tax. How about a graduated tax on new cars based on mileage? Or putting those oil-company and rich-people tax cuts to use for research? Or eliminating the cuts and using the money for mass transportation improvements? It’s always the poor and middle classes who get stuck being the responsible citizens.Mike Flanigan Chevy Chase Md.: I applaud your focus on raising the gas tax and on our energy policy in general. But I think you should take more care in what you propose as alternatives to imported oil. Today you promoted hybrids that run on biofuels such as ethanol. The last time I looked at the issue a number of studies indicate that if corn is the source of the ethanol it takes more energy to produce a quantity of ethanol than we get out of the product. The other sources of biofuels are really in their infancy.Oliver Patton Alexandria Va.: I have followed your campaign for higher fuel taxes with great interest. It’s an important idea that needs to be fully aired.Two questions:1. How do we know that $4 a gallon will in fact change consumer decision-making? I understand the obvious answer — that people will look for other ways to lower their costs — but maybe that doesn’t happen in a serious way until we’re paying $10 a gallon. I don’t think you can look to European tax policy as an example because their geographic circumstances are so different from ours. My point is: it is critically important that the number be right. If you ask me to double or triple my automotive expenses for a specific cause I expect to see results pretty quickly. Otherwise you’ve got a political donnybrook on your hands. And you need to have agreement on what the federal government will do with all that money. Should all of it go into the Highway Trust Fund — we do need to do something about congestion — or should a portion of it go to say a new nuclear submarine every year or to a new gym for the House of Representatives?2. I also have a question regarding your assertion that we need to stop hitting ourselves in the face by sending money over to oil-exporting nations that either directly or indirectly support the terrorist tactics of radical Islam. I couldn’t agree more. But if we stopped buying oil from those nations tomorrow — stopped cold — it would make no significant difference in their income. Oh there would be a downturn in their revenue for a while but India and China would make up the gap in short order. So the money would still be there. We’d have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not funding our enemies but they’d still be funded. Am I missing something?Richard Moore Albany N.Y.: While I agree with your assessment of the energy crisis and am in favor of a significant increase in the gasoline tax I should point out that I agree because I can afford to agree. It wasn’t that long ago however that I commuted 70 miles round trip because I couldn’t afford a house in or near Princeton N.J. where I worked. Actually few who live in Princeton work in Princeton — business owners and old money exceptions notwithstanding. I now live within walking and biking distance of my work and a tank of gas lasts around a month. But I’m still very concerned about our gluttony for energy.What I believe we need is a two-pronged approach to energy independence. First as you point out a realistic gasoline tax would encourage commuters to carpool or find other means to get to work. This leads me to my second element — put that additional money into improving mass transit and making it easier for people to walk or ride bicycles to their place of business. As I said I can walk to work — but the route is along a heavily-traveled road with cars and trucks whizzing by me an arm’s length away. Why not put down a 6-foot wide asphalt path along every road deemed a commuter route? It would certainly make it easier for me and I’d wager that a great number of people who live even farther out would ride bicycles or walk. And it would be easy. I don’t get it.Anyway that’s my opinion.Kathy Ann Walsh Scottsdale Ariz.: I understand and agree with your logic about the long-range effect that raising the gas tax would have in forcing auto makers to greatly improve fuel efficiency. And I realize that for upper-middle-class people and above it would be a cost they could absorb without too much suffering. But I think there are an awful lot of people in this country who would be devastated by prices that high especially in places that lack decent mass transit. Some of them would not be able to afford to get to their jobs. Some small-business owners like landscapers who must use a vehicle in their businesses would not always be able to pass the cost along to their customers. I don’t think tax breaks for the poor would be quick enough so what else?
 3820,  1997, a, Much of the time Room 3-223 is a fairly harmonious place. Simone Rivera 9 said she felt comfortable enough in class to answer honestly when another girl Caroline Sepulveda asked her if she had both a mother and father at home. ''I said 'No' '' Simone recalled the other night her mother at her side. ''She said 'Why?' So I told her 'Because my mom is gay.' ''And Hillary Fertig the class's 23-year-old student teacher who attended only Jewish day schools and yeshivas until age 18 said she was greeted enthusiastically when she asked several black students to teach her the rap song they were singing. ''I said 'I'm white. Do you think I can sing it the same way as you?' '' Ms. Fertig recalled. ''They said 'Of course.' ''But sometimes the students demonstrate flashes of intolerance.Ms. Fertig said that she once watched a Hispanic girl snatch a book from a classmate saying ''You can't touch it because you're black.'' Jyoti Sharma who has picked up many of the vocal cadences of her parents' native India said a classmate had derided her accent as ''weird.''And Seiji Iino said a boy had called him a ''nigger'' in the lunchroom. ''He doesn't even know what it means'' concluded Seiji whose family is from Japan and Austria.Other students say they have been taunted not because of their race but for other perceived weaknesses. Christopher Barrett an excellent basketball player who is 3 feet 9 inches tall said he had been hurt by the catcalls of girls during games at recess. They call him Shorty.Throughout the year Mr. Kesler sought to eradicate his pupils' biases by presenting them with role models and road maps for how best to get along. The books he has read to them feature main characters who are about their age but whose backgrounds are mixed.The protagonist of ''J. T.'' is a 10-year-old boy who lives in a Harlem tenement. ''Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes'' is about a 12-year-old Japanese girl. ''. . . And Now Miguel'' tells the story of a shepherd boy in New Mexico.

 5190,  1989, a, It is fitting that on the way to his shipboard summit meeting with George Bush Mikhail Gorbachev is stopping today at Vatican City for an audience with the Pope. More than any American President or Western leader John Paul II has played a crucial role in the historic liberalization of the Communist world.It was Solidarity after all that first broke the grip of Communist totalitarianism and Lech Walesa himself has described this Pope's galvinizing effect on his movement. If Mr. Walesa is the father of the breakup of monolithic Communism the Pope is its spiritual godfather. Thus there is poignancy for Roman Catholics in knowing that the man who helped open the way to democracy in the East is also the man who slammed shut the window of renewal that Pope John XXIII opened in 1962.For many Catholics the effect of John Paul II's papacy has been profoundly - and often literally - demoralizing. Should the Communist rulers of Rumania ever be deposed the Pope may be left as the last absolute authority in Europe.But as we listened to Mr. Gorbachev's astounding affirmation of religious values yesterday in Rome we remembered that it was his visits both to Beijing and to East Berlin that seemed to spark an outpouring of democratic sentiment. Perhaps the world's top Communist can give the head of the Catholic Church some advice today on letting go outmoded controls to save what is essential to an organization and to a creed.
 5628,  1986, a, The John Birch Society the group that has crusaded for 28 years against big government and what it views as a world Communist conspiracy has come upon hard times.The group is staggering with a $9 million deficit and for the first time is appealing widely for financial help.In addition the question of how much to criticize President Reagan has created an internal battle that has turned the widow of the society's founder Robert F. Welch against the group's new leadership.''I have nothing to do with the society'' said Marian P. Welch who is in her 80's and living in a retirement home in Weston near this Boston suburb where her husband had the society's headquarters. ''The people who are running it are not standing on what it started out to be at all.''
 2117,  2007, a, Talk has abounded in political circles recently about the relationship between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Andrew M. Cuomo the attorney general. That relationship is said to be strained after Mr. Cuomo’s investigation this summer of efforts by Mr. Spitzer’s aides to generate negative news stories on the travels on state aircraft by the State Senate majority leader Joseph L. Bruno.So many people at today’s state Democratic Party meeting in Garden City were watching closely as Mr. Spitzer finishing his speech came down from the stage — just 10 feet away from Mr. Cuomo who was sitting in a front-row seat and was next to speak. Mr. Spitzer strode away through a side door without nary a handshake shared with his fellow Democrat. Routine behavior or meaningful gesture? We’ll let the Albany Kremlinologists among you decide what just happened on Long Island.Mr. Spitzer got away from the conference center without taking questions from reporters. For his part Mr. Cuomo praised Mr. Spitzer in his speech and played down talk of a rift when speaking with reporters afterward.“One speaker finishes and leave; the next speaker starts” Mr. Cuomo said. Pressed by a reporter he said: “I didn’t think people read into a rivalry. I don’t think there is a rivalry. So I don’t think you’d have to compensate for one because I don’t think it exists in the first place.”Also playing down suggestions of discomfort between the two men was the state party chairwoman June O’Neill.“There’s a great Abe Lincoln quote: How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg?” she said. “The answer is four. Calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg.”

 3893,  1997, a, To the Editor:In your Sept. 27 editorial on single-sex schools you state that the Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem ''provides the kind of warm learning environment and personalized attention that would benefit any student girl or boy.'' However the girls' academy provides a conducive learning environment to girls precisely because many girls learn better in the absence of boys whose aggressiveness is often intimidating and demoralizing to female students.On the other hand society is ill served by the establishment of all-boys schools because males already are in a position of dominance. Girls should be permitted to develop their intellectual abilities in a setting conducive to engendering a certain level of confidence before they enter universities where they will then be able to compete on more equal terms with males.RONALD A. KIEVELos Angeles Sept. 29 1997

 1789,  2009, a, Congressional Republicans offered qualified support Tuesday for President Obama’s proposed troop increase in Afghanistan but several senior Democrats took sharp exception to the president’s plan illustrating the deep divide in the party over the conflict.“I see no good reason for us to send another 30000 or more troops to Afghanistan when we have so many pressing issues – like our economy – to deal with in this country” said Representative Louise Slaughter Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the Rules Committee.The resistance by the Democrats demonstrated that Republican backing for the troop build-up plan will be crucial to compensate for Democratic defections making it likely that Republicans will provide the margin for approval when the added troops are subject to a Congressional vote probably in the form of a spending bill next year.While top Republicans welcomed what they portrayed as a belated decision by Mr. Obama to meet Pentagon requests for more troops they also raised objections to any withdrawal deadlines or Democratic talk of new taxes to pay for the military effort.“Setting a draw-down date before this surge has even begun is a mistake and it sends a mixed message to both our friends and our enemies regarding our long-term commitment to success” said Senator John Cornyn Republican of Texas.Senator John McCain of Arizona the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee voiced similar complaints earlier Tuesday and aired them again in a White House meeting with the president on the war plans officials said.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Republican leader who has differed with the president on almost every issue this year said he would support Mr. Obama’s plan but warned against a deadline.“As this surge of forces produces results in security governance and in capabilities of the Afghanistan Security Forces we must ensure that the transition of responsibilities is based on conditions not timelines” Mr. McConnell said.Other Republicans said they needed to take a closer look at the details of the strategy and monitor upcoming hearings.“Today we received a broad overview from the president about his plan for Afghanistan” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio the Republican leader. “This is a complex issue and plenty of questions must still be answered. The most fundamental is whether this plan will help us achieve success.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a noncommittal statement on the speech saying “the American people and the Congress will now have an opportunity to fully examine this strategy.”Senator Harry Reid of Nevada the majority leader was more supportive saying Mr. Obama “made a convincing case that sending additional troops to Afghanistan to fight Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is critical to our national security.”But the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate Richard J. Durbin of Illinois a close ally of the president said he was not yet ready to render judgment.“President Obama asked for time to make his decision on a new policy in Afghanistan” Mr. Durbin said in a statement. “I am going to take some time to think through the proposal he presented tonight.”Other Democrats quickly weighed in against the troop increase making it clear they were prepared to break with the president. “I support the president’s mission and exit strategy for Afghanistan but I do not support adding more troops because there are now 200000 American NATO and Afghan forces fighting roughly 20000 Taliban and less than 100 al Qaeda” said Senator Barbara Boxer Democrat of California.Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania who converted to the Democratic Party earlier this year also came out in opposition saying he was not persuaded that additional troops in Afghanistan would defeat Al Qaeda.“If Al Qaeda can operate out of Yemen or Somalia why fight in Afghanistan where no one has succeeded?” Mr. Specter said.Democratic officials acknowledged there is serious unrest among Congressional Democrats over Mr. Obama’s plan and said his build-up proposal is being greeted as something of a surprise even though as a candidate the president made clear he intended to shift military resources from Iraq to Afghanistan.Other Democrats quickly moved behind the president’s strategy.“I think the president has a sensible plan both short- and- long term to empower the Afghan people and allow for U.S. troops to complete their mission and come home” said Senator Bill Nelson Democrat of Florida. “The plan will allow 50000 additional Afghan troops to be trained by next July so they can hold areas that are turned over to them.”Senator Evan Bayh Democrat of Indiana said: “No one wants to send more money or more American soldiers to Afghanistan including me. But we were attacked from that country and 3000 innocent Americans were killed. We must do what it takes to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a platform for attacks on the United States.”

 4534,  1993, a, Even by the transient standards of the sport he governs David Stern's itinerary was beginning to get out of hand. Chicago to Munich to Chicago to London to Chicago to the start of the National Basketball Association regular season Friday night."I'm negotiating with Granik to handle London" the N.B.A. commissioner said recently with a sigh. He was referring to his deputy Russell Granik and preseason games at Wembley Arena this past weekend between the Orlando Magic and the Atlanta Hawks.Clearly it was time for Stern to prioritize.In Munich it was the Phoenix Suns' turn to carry the N.B.A. banner into the global basketball community. In London there was another lucrative market in which to nest. But for all the N.B.A.'s much-publicized efforts to achieve nirvana-by-satellite Stern's reluctance to leave Chicago was an indication that something may be rotten at the core of this American sports machine. A Universe Full of StarsStern has not been in Chicago trying to convince Michael Jordan to unretire. Contrary to popular belief the stunning departure of the game's greatest star ranks low on his list of current headaches. With all due respect Stern's 25-year association with the N.B.A. has convinced the 50-year-old son of a New York deli owner that the reservoir of superior talent never runs dry. But in his opinion the collective good will that has been the driving force behind the league's meteoric rise since the early 1980's is as fragile and precious as the ligaments in every player's knee.
 3166,  2001, a, Etta James a hefty 63-year-old who has been singing professionally since she was a teenager was helped onto the stage at the B. B. King Blues Club by an attendant on Thursday night and she performed seated. She had the haughty jaded expression of an empress overseeing workaday matters as if she took her attentive band and the adoring audience for granted. And though her most recent album ''Blue Gardenia'' (Private Music/BMG) is a set of jazz standards she didn't sing any of them. Instead her set stuck to songs she may have performed thousands of times mostly her hits from the 1950's and 1960's.Yet on Thursday night the beginning of a three-night stand on the first anniversary of the club (at 243 West 42nd Street in Manhattan) Ms. James's routine reached into some essence of American music: the soul alchemy of sorrow laughter carnality fury loss and hope.Ms. James's voice remembers every stage of her life. She encompasses coy teenager and amorous woman heartbroken lover and spiteful victim party girl and desperate addict. Her 1995 autobiography ''Rage to Survive'' detailed her struggles with men drugs and the music business but her singing tells more.She wields her voice with the timing of a falcon breezing aloft and then darting directly and implacably toward its target. She flirts sobs chuckles taunts growls; she moans with satisfaction and with pain. In one song she sings quick glancing lines skimming them across a steady vamp; in the next she lingers over words connecting them in long caressing phrases. As she does even her familiar songs illuminate the emotional turmoil that they sum up so concisely.

 6257,  1973, a, LAKE APASTEPEQUE El Salvador Sept. 25—American scientists have entered the final stages of research that they feel may lead to the virtual elimination of malaria as a major world health problem.Without using insecticides the scientists reduced by 99 per cent malaria‐carrying Anopheles mosquitoes this 100‐acre lake and in the 5.4 square miles of valley around it. They are now looking for a site in Central America to conduct an operational trial in an area of 50 square miles.Using a chemical agent developed by the United States Government and known only as Ent ‐ 61585 the scientists sterilized 4.5 million male Anopheles mosquitoes released them here and recorded the 99 per cent reduction during five months last year.The scientists are affiliated with the Public Health Service's Central America research station in San Salvador just 37 miles from Lake Apaste peque. The research is being conducted in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and with the cooperation of the Government of El Salvador which has provided the research station with laboratory space at no cost.

 326,  2017, a, It began Novaya Gazeta reported after a Moscow-based gay rights group GayRussia.ru applied for permits to stage gay pride parades in four cities in Russia’s predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region of which Chechnya is a part.The group had not focused on the Muslim areas. It had been applying for permits for gay parades in provincial cities around Russia and collecting the inevitable denials in order to build a case about gay rights and freedom of assembly with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg France. It had applied to more than 90 municipal governments. Nikolai Alekseev a gay rights activist coordinating this effort told Novaya Gazeta he had chosen this tactic rather than staging risky unsanctioned gay parades.The group had not applied for a permit in Chechnya but in another Muslim region in southern Russia Kabardino-Balkaria. The mere application there — denied as usual — had prompted an anti-gay counterdemonstration.In the restive Muslim regions Mr. Putin has empowered local leaders to press agendas of traditional Muslim values to co-opt an Islamist underground. The gay pride parade applications became a galvanizing issue.“In Chechnya the command was given for a ‘prophylactic sweep’ and it went as far as real murders” Novaya Gazeta reported.According to the report the authorities set to finding and arresting closeted gay men partly by posing as men looking for dates on social networking sites.“Of course none of these people in any way demonstrated their sexual orientation publicly — in the Caucasus this is equal to a death sentence” the newspaper wrote of those detained in the sweep.
 6124,  1977, a, Others include Robert Goulet Ruth Carter Stapleton and James Irwin the astronaut. The common element among them is conversion usually in dramatic fashion to a “personal relationship to Jesus Christ” in the mature years.FOr Mr. Ash the experience of deepened commitment took place he says 10 years ago. Like many others in the ranks of the evangelical surge he had dropped out of church for many years and was leading a life that was successful by accepted social standards. But he says he felt an “emptiness” that led him on a spiritual quest.He and his family came upon St. Paul's here in 1974: “My life has changed in such a basic way” he said. “I was always the life of the party and thought I'd give up a lot by becoming a Christian. But I didn't. I'm a more positive thinker than ever.”Basis of PhenomenonThe theory that people go through a series of crucial stock‐taking periods in theirmiddle years is used by some observers as one basis for explaining the spiritual phenomenon.The Rev. Eugene Fullam rector of St. Paul's says many of the large segment of people in the 35-to-55-year-old group in his parish had run into “difficulty with the narrow views of the world that they had picked up in their youth such as the idea that science held all the answers.” Many of them he says “found that their philosophies left them unsupported in their later lives.”Father Fullam a robust man whose preaching has proved uncommonly persuasive in this comfortable upper-middle‐class community says that many people recommit themselves in the middle years and thereby move toward ‘a more mature faith.”An alternative’ interpretation is that many new evangelicals and charismatics are actually going back to their spiritual roots. For example Dr. Donald Carroll coordinator of church research at the Hartford Seminary Foundation surveyed Baptist churches in Atlanta recently and found that for many newcomers to the city especially those from small towns the church was a stabilizing factor.

 3133,  2001, a, The baby alligator sighted in Harlem Meer in Central Park was actually a baby spectacled caiman. But its appearance recalled that most enduring urban legend the alligators who roam the city's sewers.These alligators are said to trace their origins to an ur-alligator who was flushed down a toilet and found a convenient breeding place in the sewers. This ur-alligator's offspring have proved endlessly fascinating to creative artists.Radiohead's new song ''Alligators in the Sewers'' (not on its new CD but posted on the Internet) includes the lament:Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fastGrow up fastAnything you want it can be doneHow did you go bad?A giant alligator prowled the sewers in John Sayles's 1980 film ''Alligator'' one of the decade's memorable horror films. Unsurprisingly 16 years later the movie gave birth to ''Alligator II -- The Mutation.''

 5085,  1989, a, Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun By Wess Roberts Ph.D. 110 pages. Warner Books. $16.95. Tao Te Ching A New English Version With Foreword and Notes By Stephen Mitchell 108 pages. Harper & Row. $15.95.Not long ago behavioral advice books had a pleasant pluck-and-luck air. They told the reader how to achieve some goal or inner harmony - in personal relationships or out in the marketplace - by taking 5 or 10 common-sense steps. Several of them offered helpful tips to people unable to cope with the trials of daily life. Mainly these books were cheerful; they had good manners.Lately a different breed of advice book has appeared that is aggressive if not downright hostile. The underlying philosophy - invariably referred to as the bottom line - amounts to advice on how to gull your fellow-man before he does it to you. One current title ''Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive'' boasts on its jacket that it tells you how to ''outsell outmanage outmotivate and outnegotiate your competition.'' In the process you become part of the shark species too.Now comes ''Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun'' which raises the stakes even higher by choosing as its role model one of the great murderers of the barbarian world. This small stretched-out book is intended to serve as a guide for the business executive. The reader comes across a modern phrase such as ''he leveraged its power'' one of many anachronisms more suitable for the board room. It is unlikely that the Huns spoke that way around the campfires after they had sacked villages and towns in Italy and Gaul. As a spoof the book might be fun; but Wess Roberts its humorless author isn't kidding.

 2727,  2003, a, A 97-acre parcel of prime riverfront land vacant since an automotive factory closed seven years ago would be transformed into a waterfront promenade with a 150-room hotel 1562 housing units a handful of small shops and tree-lined public walkways leading to the heart of Sleepy Hollow under development plans outlined this week.The project's developers the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills N.J. presented their plans to village officials and residents at Sleepy Hollow High School tonight. The residential component of the plan includes 200 housing units for the elderly and 21 moderately priced town houses and the developers expect the project to have 185000 square feet of retail space and 95000 square feet of office space. They would not give an estimate of the project's cost.The project named Lighthouse Landing is to rise just north of the Tappan Zee Bridge on the largest developable tract of land on the Hudson River in Westchester property that has been in limbo since the auto assembly plant owned by General Motors closed in 1996. Last year the village frustrated by the delay began legal proceedings against G.M. to buy the property but the parties settled the dispute in September after G.M. agreed to have final development plans approved by August 2005. If that deadline passes Sleepy Hollow can exercise its option to buy the land.Mayor Philip E. Zegarelli called the design which covers 80 percent of the lot ''a good jumping-off point to begin the approval process.'' The remaining 20 percent would be open space.

 4445,  1993, a, Trade Center tenants hustled yesterday to find alternative spaces and by last night it was apparent that in spite of the bomb many would be back in business today.For some companies like Fuji Bank Ltd. the task of setting up for today was under way before employees vacated their trade center space Friday. Katsuma Ohara general manager of the financial company's Americas division said 150 of the 450 people in the trade center operation would be in a computer center in North Bergen N.J. where the Fuji Bank had previously arranged for backup space. The rest would be in branch offices in Manhattan.Workers at other companies will be moving in with colleagues and clients. Still other trade center companies will dispatch workers to their other nearby locations.Yesterday morning a half-dozen employees of Deloitte & Touche met a moving van packed with tax records of their clients at the accounting company's temporary space in 1633 Broadway at 50th Street.
 308,  2017, a, There’s the Gregorian calendar and then there’s the fashion calendar. According to the style schedule spring is solidly upon us. One need only to look at the dizzying array of goodies now arriving in stores. Yet despite the flood of tantalizing warm-weather options most of us are living with temperatures that willfully go against our fashion fantasies. Often when we’re still in coats and boots the only weather-appropriate way to dip a toe into the new season is with a fresh top. And since a statement blouse knit or hoodie happens to be the cornerstone of one of the season’s most striking looks there is really no reason to wait any longer to splurge. Here the best trends to try for your top half.

 1313,  2011, a, Correction Appended | Rich Clarkson has been a pivotal figure in photojournalism for the last half-century. While he was the director of photography at The Topeka Capital-Journal in Kansas his staff of photographers — which included Brian Lanker Jim Richardson and David Alan Harvey — produced groundbreaking news and documentary photography. He was also assistant managing editor for graphics of The Denver Post and director of photography of The National Geographic Society.On top of that during his career Mr. Clarkson has been photographing college basketball — in particular the N.C.A.A. Final Four. His first taste of the N.C.A.A. finals was as a student at Kansas University in 1952 when his school won the championship. He covered the tournaments for Sports Illustrated from the 1970s through to the 1990s. And for the last decade he and his company Rich Clarkson and Associates have photographed the Final Four on contract with the N.C.A.A.In this audio slide show produced by James Estrin and Kerri MacDonald Mr. Clarkson discusses a lifetime photographing the N.C.A.A. tournament.CorrectionAn earlier version of this post stated that Kansas won the N.C.A.A. tournament in 1953. Kansas won in 1952. The team was defeated the following year by Indiana.

 2299,  2006, a, That's a pretty big checklist no doubt. But these tasks are far more doable than trying to rewind history to re-create a pre-civil rights era Democratic South in post-civil rights America.The South has long been America's regional political outlier. When the Republicans dominated national politics for seven decades between the Civil War and the New Deal they did so with almost no support from the South. Thanks to the significant African-American population base in the South the Democrats will never be so handicapped from the outset because there will always be a minimum degree of Democratic support and number of Democratic elected officials in the region. Building a non-southern majority therefore should be much easier for Democrats today than it was for the Republicans a century ago. Anyone who claims otherwise is willfully ignoring partisan history not to mention contemporary demography.As Democrats expand their non-southern support the South will continue to assimilate into the national political culture from which it had mostly divorced itself until recent decades. Then and only then can Democrats begin to rebrand themselves in Dixie. In the interim the Democrats' near-term goal should be to isolate the Republicans as a regional party that owns most of the South but little else.FLUNKING THE LITMUS TESTThe Republicans now dominate the South. Neither Al Gore nor John Kerry won a single southern state in their consecutive failed presidential bids. The GOP controls solid majorities of southern governors and members of Congress and a growing share of state legislative chambers and seats. In 2004 Republicans barely broke a sweat in claiming all five U.S. Senate seats vacated by retiring southern Democrats and George W. Bush improved his vote share compared to 2000 in every southern state except North Carolina - the home of his opponent's running mate.Why do Democrats struggle so mightily in the South? The reasons are many and include specific factors such as the historical absence of organized labor presence in the region as well as more general factors like a political tradition of stubborn contraposition to northern political attitudes. The short answer however is that social and cultural issues tend to trump economic considerations for many voters in the South where race and religion are woven through almost every aspect of the region's political culture. There are cultural conservatives outside the South and libertarian populists inside the region of course. But southerners hold distinctly conservative values and have long prided themselves for their obstinacy for resisting the social transformations unfolding elsewhere across America. What Thomas Frank laments has gone wrong in Kansas is even more wrong in the South where cultural issues weigh heavily in the minds of voters in America's poorest region.Against this backdrop of cultural conservatism political candidates running in all but a few isolated pockets of the South essentially must pass a values "litmus test." Stuart Brunson campaign manager for Tennessee's popular Democratic governor Phil Bredesen explained how it works. "Voters go through a two-step process" says Brunson. "The first is a credentialing filter which asks if a candidate shares their values. The second is on issues - education health care the economy." Howard Dean was roundly criticized during the 2004 Democratic primaries for openly referring to this phenomenon with his pithy "god guns and gays" tagline. The blue-blooded Vermont governor and future Democratic National Committee chair did not need to speak in folksy aphorisms to prove he understood the underlying dynamics of modern southern politics.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some believe the party must moderate its positions on social issues. The truth is that moderation is unlikely to assuage no less convert wary southern conservatives. Besides whatever small gains might come from abandoning support for reproductive choice or gay rights will likely be erased by the votes lost both inside and outside the South from projecting moral ambiguity. Frustrated Democrats tend to either avoid social issues altogether or worse make clumsy attempts at cultural contortionism. We are thus treated to campaign images of Al Gore wearing cowboy boots with his belt-clipped Blackberry or a barn jacket-clad John Kerry buying a goose hunting license. These hollow inauthentic gestures only accentuate and magnify the Democrats' cultural disconnect forcing liberals to avert their eyes in horror while conservatives look on from afar with a mixture of disdain and disbelief.Others think Democrats can bridge the cultural gap by emphasizing the destructive impacts of Republican economic policies. But it's extraordinarily difficult for Democratic candidates to differentiate themselves sufficiently on economic policies to compensate for the built-in advantages Republicans enjoy on social issues and post-NAFTA Democrats are having a hard time convincing many working-class voters that there is any meaningful differentiation at all. Besides no matter how attractive their economic messages may be Democrats must first pass through the "cultural credentialing" filter to get a full hearing from southerners on economic policy. The best Democrats can do is hope for fate to drop in their laps a huge electoral windfall like an economic collapse of such magnitude that it eliminates the culture filter or a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina that allows Democrats to play the incompetence card. This is neither a workable long-term strategy nor a noble way to run a political party.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIn theory the Democrats' economic messages ought to be embraced by working-class white and black southerners with equal gusto. Yet nowhere in America do people who come from similar economic stations vote so differently from one another. The self-comforting belief among Democrats that southerners vote against their interests is both condescending and false: White southerners are aware of their economic interests but simply assign more weight to social issues than economic ones and accordingly vote Republican; because they experience far less internal dissonance between the partisan implications of their cultural and economic preferences African Americans in the South vote Democratic. Consequently because white southerners far outnumber African Americans neither hedging on cultural issues nor highlighting economic policy differences - or even both approaches in conjunction - can save the Democrats in the South. The only task more difficult than crafting a series of economic ideas capable of convincing white southern conservatives to ignore their social values is persuading them that the Democratic Party shares those values in the first place.So why bother trying to leap the wide cultural chasm to reach them? Rather than superficial and mostly futile pandering to the nation's most conservative voters Democrats should begin to build a non-southern majority by unapologetically tailoring policies and targeting messages to more receptive audiences outside the South. Bowing and scraping to salvage a few southern votes here and there only leads to the sort of ideological schizophrenia that does little to improve the Democrats' southern fortunes and worse muddies the party's image outside the South.SISYPHEAN SOUTHERN SITUATIONThe Democrats' situation is exacerbated by two glaring political liabilities in the South. The first is that racial polarization has created a virtual Republican monopoly of the southern white vote that prevents Democrats from winning statewide races. The second is that religion plays a more prominent role in the South than in any other region.The central irony of southern politics is that the nation's most Republican region is home to half of all African Americans the Democratic party's most loyal voters. Unfortunately racial antagonisms exacerbate the Democrats' electoral problems in the South creating a white countermobilization - a "blacklash" so to speak - that fuels Republican victories. In the 2000 and 2004 elections many of George W. Bush's biggest wins came in southern states with the highest share of African Americans and some Democratic congressional candidates are capturing as little as 30 percent of the white vote in the South. By contrast the African-American vote in presidential elections and statewide contests is most successful for Democrats when it is part of multiethnic voting coalitions outside the South as it is in states such as Illinois Maryland Michigan New Jersey New York Ohio and Pennsylvania. Republicans have established a virtual monopoly on the white southern vote - and need to given the partisan head start Democrats enjoy by virtue of the size of the African-American populations in most southern states. Meanwhile as we will see later the Republicans have systematically diluted the power of African Americans by packing them into as few congressional and state legislative districts as possible. Unless the Democrats are prepared to abandon shamelessly their commitment to racial justice in order to win elections these realities do not suggest a Democratic revival in the South any time soon.Whereas secular electorates elsewhere are more likely to hold religion aside or even reject the interference of church into state matters the party's second liability is that churchgoing faithful are very skeptical of Democratic candidates. The partisan effects of southern piety are astounding. No region boasts a greater share of evangelicals than the South. According to surveys conducted by the University of North Carolina southerners are more likely than non-southerners to believe that God exists and answers prayers in the biblical account of creation and that people are sometimes possessed by the devil. A Pew Forum study conducted prior to the 2004 election by the University of Akron's John C. Green showed Democrats holding a narrow lead in partisan identification among Catholics and trailing only slightly among mainline Protestants but facing a 56 percent to 27 percent Republican edge among evangelical Christians. Evangelicals in the South are not merely more numerous but doctrinally and politically more conservative than non-southern evangelicals. Not surprising 2004 exit polls reported that nearly 4 in 5 self-described white evangelicals voted for George W. Bush. The top eighteen states in terms of their share of white evangelicals - which of course include every southern state - went for Bush. The evangelical chorus in the South wears red sings with a decidedly conservative tenor and votes righteously.Two partisan features of the South further diminish any hope that Democrats harbor about a regional resurgence.The first is the rising share of southerners who reached political maturity since Richard Nixon's successful use of the "southern strategy" in 1968. Born during the latter stages of the New Deal and coming of age after the Great Society this postboomer generation of southern Republicans share no familial or historical connection whatsoever to the New Deal-era Democratic Party. Southerners under the age of 50 in some states have never seen a Democrat capture their state's electoral votes. As tough as it may be to reconvert Republican seniors who once revered Franklin Roosevelt or supported Lyndon Johnson it will be even tougher to attract young southerners who associate the national Democratic Party with Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and have never cast a Democratic vote in their lives. . . .
 4315,  1994, a, To the world she was Marilyn Monroe the quintessentially glamorous movie star. To BERNIECE BAKER MIRACLE she was Norma Jean Mortensen a long-lost half sister.Along with her daughter Mona Rae Miracle Mrs. Miracle has written "My Sister Marilyn" a book being published by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill today which would have been the actress's 68th birthday.Mrs. Miracle 74 who was raised by her father and stepmother did not know that her mother Gladys Baker was alive nor did she know that she had a half sister until 1938. And she did not meet Miss Monroe until 1944."By then she was married to her first husband Jim Dougherty and came to Detroit by train to visit us" Mrs. Miracle said yesterday. "From then on we stayed in touch. She used to call me when she was married to Arthur Miller and having trouble. I helped Joe DiMaggio arrange her funeral. I chose her casket and decided on the pale green dress she wore. She was a wonderful sister." NADINE BROZAN
 2698,  2003, a, To the Editor:Verlyn Klinkenborg's Editorial Observer about H. L. Mencken (''Remembering the Permanent Opposition of H. L. Mencken'' Dec. 30) made me reflect on how outrage serves our democracy.Senator Trent Lott's record on race has finally raised the ire of the Republican Party. But Senator Bill Frist shows that a sexist may still wander where racists fear to tread.Mr. Frist's opposition to sex education international family planning and emergency contraception demonstrates an attitude toward women that also deserves a vehement outcry. The discrimination against women still practiced by the Augusta National Golf Club which didn't admit a black member until 1990 suggests that misogyny may have even deeper roots than racism.I hope that I live long enough to see insensitivity to women by our leaders get the anger it deserves.

 1748,  2009, a, Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesAs part of its 2010-11 season dedicated to the work of the playwright Tony Kushner the Signature Theater Company will mount the first New York revival of his “Angels in America” since the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning work closed on Broadway in 1994 the troupe’s artistic director said this afternoon.The production to be directed by Michael Greif (“Next to Normal” “Rent”) will open at the Signature’s 160-seat theater late in 2010 and is expected to run for about four months said the artistic director James Houghton. Both plays that make up “Angels” — “Millennium Approaches” and “Perestroika” — will run in repertory; the theater also plans to have performance days where the plays (each three and a half hours) are presented back to back.Set in 1985 and 1986 against the backdrop of the AIDS epidemic and the Reagan administration “Angels” interweaves the stories of a gay couple grappling with AIDS; a closeted Mormon lawyer and his drug-addicted wife; and several other often fantastical characters from the real-life right-wing lawyer Roy Cohn to a steel-winged angel who memorably crashes through a ceiling at the end of “Millennium Approaches.”“Millennium Approaches” opened on Broadway in May 1993 and “Perestroika” that November and were widely praised as landmark works of theater as well as significant meditations on gay life politics and religion in America. Both parts of “Angels” won Tony Awards in 1993 and ’94 for best play and “Millennium Approaches” won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1993.Mr. Houghton said that he and Mr. Kushner agreed very quickly that the timing was ripe to include an “Angels” revival in a season devoted to Kushner plays (Signature features work by a single playwright over a full season).“Among other things the play is a rumination on how we confront change the challenge of change and our choices around the themes of changes — both the courageous choices we make and the less so” Mr. Houghton said. “It’s an incredibly relevant piece of writing for the America that we’re living in today.”No casting decisions have been made yet and Mr. Houghton said that the creative team was in the early stages of conceptualizing an epic work like “Angels” for Signature’s intimate Off Broadway space on 42nd Street.“It’s a huge challenge to figure out how to make these terrifically theatrical elements come to life within certain space limitations but the great thing about theater is that limitations often yield truly creative and original results” Mr. Houghton said.Asked if the angel would still crash onto the stage at the end of “Millennium Approaches” — a moment that prompts a character to remark “Very Steven Spielberg” — Mr. Houghton said “We don’t know yet how we’re solving that particular challenge.”Mr. Kushner said in a statement that Signature was “the perfect space” for both the epic and intimate qualities of “Angels.” He is likely to attend rehearsals Mr. Houghton said but has no plans to do any new writing on “Angels.”The Kushner season will include two other plays which Mr. Houghton was not ready to announce yet. He said he and Mr. Kushner were discussing the possibility of him writing a new play — Signature seasons often include a new work by the playwright being showcased — but nothing had been decided.As part of Signature’s Ticket Initiative sponsored chiefly by Time Warner Inc. all tickets to “Angels” will be $20. The production is also being supported by a $750000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided expressly for the “Angels” revival Mr. Houghton said.

 4032,  1996, a, Six years ago Eric and Virginia Holst exchanged their wedding vows standing side by side at the altar of St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church here on Main Street and Ocean Avenue. Today their coffins rested side by side before the same altar.Dr. and Mrs. Holst had boarded Trans World Airlines Flight 800 planning to celebrate their sixth anniversary in Paris. The crash brought them home.Until Flight 800 fell from the sky most of the world had never heard of the Long Island inlet towns called the Moriches. But the Holsts had lived right nearby in Manorville and Dr. Holst a dentist practiced at Moriches Dental Associates on Main Street.Hundreds of people crowded the oatmeal-colored church with a green-tiled roof for the funeral this morning as the towns that have played host to a world of grief paused to mourn two of their own.
 2708,  2003, a, Against all advice she left the Met to act in Shakespearean productions on Broadway for the actor and producer David Belasco. That work led to ''Rose-Marie'' originally about a sweet French-Canadian girl and her love for a fur trapper wrongly accused of murder. (The Canadian mountie a minor role in the stage version became the love interest in the movie in which he was personified by Nelson Eddy.)Miss Ellis left the show after a year to appear in ''The Dybbuk'' a dramatic production at the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side where she happily traded a weekly paycheck of $500 for one of $10. Arthur Hammerstein was furious and forced her to sign an agreement preventing her from singing for any management but his. She never sang onstage in the United States again.Miss Ellis had already been divorced twice when she began appearing with Basil Sydney an English matinee idol in productions that included a long-running modern-dress version of ''The Taming of the Shrew. They married on a whim in 1929.There were professional tensions between the two some caused by the offers she received to act in plays and films for which her husband was turned down. They appeared together in many plays in London until their marriage collapsed in a highly public divorce. But she was always busy with her own career including a deal to make three pictures for Paramount.Though her movies including ''All the King's Horses'' (1934) were considered mediocre at best her own acting and singing voice drew praise. Graham Greene lamented ''the waste of her sensuous appeal her Bacchanalian gleam'' in that film.She also appeared successfully in dramas like the London production of ''Strange Interlude'' in 1931. But her greatest fame was in musicals and by the late 1930's she was one of the most popular stars of the West End appearing in shows created by Novello and in costumes by Cecil Beaton. Some of the shows Novello wrote for her included ''Glamorous Night'' and ''The Dancing Years.''

 1339,  2011, a, Steve Marcus/ReutersThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether trades in health care stocks by the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors as recently as last year were made using inside information a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.The investigation comes as SAC one of the most prominent hedge funds in the world with $12 billion in assets under management has become something of a focal point for authorities. Two former SAC portfolio managers have pleaded guilty to criminal charges of using inside information to trade technology stocks.And Senator Charles E. Grassley Republican of Iowa has questioned how the S.E.C. handled referrals from Wall Street’s self-regulator the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority regarding 20 stock trades by SAC.But the S.E.C.’s investigation into trading by SAC appears to be much broader. In addition to the inquiry into trading in health care stocks — trades that took place from at least 2007 through 2010 — the agency is examining SAC’s use of expert network firms companies that connect Wall Street investors with outside experts in various industries the person briefed on the matter said.Separately the S.E.C. is looking into whether the hedge fund used inside information about the 2007 takeover of MedImmune a biotechnology company the person said. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported about the inquiry into MedImmune.A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.Neither SAC nor its billionaire founder Steven A. Cohen has been accused of wrongdoing by the S.E.C. or by any other authority. A spokesman for SAC declined to comment on Thursday.The inquiries into the SAC trades are part of an accelerating effort by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan to crack down on insider trading with a particular focus on hedge funds. The criminal investigations by federal prosecutors have resulted in charges against 49 people 39 of whom have pleaded guilty.Two people who have pleaded guilty were the former SAC employees Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil. Mr. Freeman is expected to testify Thursday at the trial of Winifred Jiau a consultant for an expert network firm who is charged with leaking inside information. SAC has said that it is “outraged” by the conduct of the two former employees.The cases against Mr. Freeman and Mr. Longueuil are part of the government’s examination of expert network firms which developed over the last decade alongside the proliferation of hedge funds. The government has filed criminal charges against 13 people connected to the firms eight of whom have pleaded guilty.The former SAC employees admitted to obtaining inside information about public companies and then using it to make profitable trades. The charges against the men detailed a cover-up straight from a television drama that involved destroying a hard drive with pliers and spreading the parts throughout the city.Others with past ties to SAC have also been ensnared in the insider trading investigation. Earlier this year Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided two hedge funds founded by former SAC executives Level Global Investors and Diamondback Capital Management. In 2009 Richard Choo-Beng Lee pleaded guilty to insider trading related to activity after he left SAC.The S.E.C. has faced criticism that it failed to bring significant cases against prominent hedge funds as well as cases stemming from the financial crisis.In April Senator Grassley asked the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in a letter to provide information on the “potential scope of suspicious trading activity” at SAC.Last month he followed up with a letter to the S.E.C. requesting to know how it handled past referrals about SAC’s trading activity.MedImmune is not among those trades referred by Finra according to people briefed on the matter.SAC executives including Peter Nussbaum the firm’s general counsel and its outside lawyers met with staff members in Mr. Grassley’s office to discuss his inquiry.Additionally federal prosecutors are examining trades in an account overseen by Mr. Cohen.Court filings related to the cases of the two former SAC portfolio managers who have pleaded guilty to insider trading indicate that the government is reviewing trades made in Mr. Cohen’s account at the suggestion of the former employees.

 3281,  2000, a, He said some of his shots had been disrupted by Patrick Ewing the 37-year-old Knicks center. ''He might be an old guy but he still can change a shot'' Carter said. ''Couple times I got in there and he bumped me in the air and caused me to miss a couple easy layups.''And some found fault with Carter for passing instead of shooting when the Raptors had a chance to win in the final moments of Game 2 last Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. Projected as the heir to Michael Jordan as the N.B.A.'s next marquee attraction Carter in the past week seemed to be the epitome of his team: not quite ready for the rarefied air of the playoffs.Charles Oakley the former Knick described the Raptors' season as ''more hype than what we're trying to accomplish as a team.''He added: ''We haven't done anything as a team. We're still building.''Worse than hype for Carter and others was the nasty exchange of words between Coach Butch Carter and several of his players last week. Among other things the coach said his roster lacked leadership. He took Christie out of his starting role. Christie used the words ludicrous and dumb to describe the coach's comments. Dee Brown said the coach's remarks about player leadership were a cop-out. In that Butch Carter does not approve of headbands Christie and Brown decided to wear black ones today.When asked about communication with his coach since the demotion Christie replied: ''I haven't talked to him once. He hasn't said anything to me. What's expected of me he needs to let me know so I can go out there and do it.'' Of the other distractions of this series such as Butch Carter's brief lawsuit against Marcus Camby of the Knicks Christie said: ''I don't think I'll remember this series for anything on the court. It'll be off the court that this series is remembered.''
 4202,  1995, a, Since the 1970's the Queens Museum of Art has held biennial or triennial exhibitions of work by artists based in Queens. The most recent entry in this series "Live/Work in Queens" reflects the borough's transformation into what the show's curator Christina Yang calls "the nation's most diverse county" one that includes more than 70 ethnic groups speaking almost 200 different languages. Four of the eight artists in the show were born in the United States but the others come from Colombia China Korea and Afghanistan. Not surprisingly the exhibition seems to revolve around the theme of ethnic identity.The problem is that the artistic representation of ethnicity too often turns into self-caricature. The relief paintings of Esperanza Cortes for instance evoke the image of the Hispanic woman as wife mother and martyr by means of an all-too-familiar vocabulary of fractured body parts rendered with sugary realism. Artists should either come to grips with the sado-masochistic subtext of this imagery or -- better yet -- give it a rest.Katherine O'Connor's black-and-white photographs of the Irish village from which her father emigrated are full of soulful melancholy faces whose lines and creases reveal their long struggle with mortality and the elements. This nostalgic view of life in the Old Country is rendered in a pseudo-clinical style that recalls photographers like Nicholas Nixon and Larry Fink but that lacks their formal wit and daring.Other artists here take a more indirect approach to identity. Amanullah Haiderzad who left Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of 1980 makes iron sculptures that echo the characters of Arabic calligraphy without literally reproducing them. Their planar strongly textured forms are curiously reminiscent of work by such American sculptors of the 1940's and 50's as David Smith Herbert Ferber and Seymour Lipton.
 5068,  1989, a, William K. Reilly President Bush's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency signaled a sharp break with Reagan Administration policies today by saying he would propose legislation to reduce acid rain.Answering questions at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on his nomination Mr. Reilly said the first item on his agenda was legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act. He said a major component of that legislation would be a program for reducing acid precipitation caused by pollution from coal-burning power plants and other sources.Mr. Reilly said that members of the Bush transition staff and the agency's staff had been working out details of the legislation and that the bill would be ready to go to Congress within a few weeks. He said the bill would contain a specific goal for reducing the pollution caused by acid rain a goal that he could not pinpoint because it was still being worked out by the staff. Cost of Plan Put at BillionsMr. Reilly was not asked at the hearing how much such a program would cost and he has declined to be interviewed on any subject until he is confirmed. Others have estimated however that many billions of dollars would have to be spent to achieve any significant reductions in the pollution responsible for acid rain.

 1613,  2010, a, Townies is a series about life in New York and occasionally other cities.In Hong Kong where I lived until I was 14 most expat kids had more than one passport; spoke English Cantonese (curse words were the gateway) and at least one romance language; and we could emulate several accents convincingly. We were well-designed for espionage.So when my father moved us from a skyscraper near the horse racing track in Hong Kong to a red brick house in San Antonio I already had a taupe American cadence prepared that I’d borrowed from “Kate and Allie” reruns and a Virginia-born boyfriend. By the time Britain returned Hong Kong to China — three years after I’d left and 156 years after they’d taken it over — I had also acquired when the occasion demanded it a quiver of y’alls.In suburban Texas I switched on the television to watch the stringently polite ceremony called “the handover.” I was a half hour from fleeing the experimental independence of a one-bedroom apartment I paid $75 a month to share with five high school classmates and heading back to my parents air-conditioned house 15 blocks away. My roommates nattered on about the soldiers’ trim yarn-dyed outfits boots and matching hats that did admittedly make the whole thing look like the reenactment of a battle between warring tribes of chauffeurs. Flags were solemnly lowered and folded fireworks were shot into the air and 6.3 million people suddenly found themselves standing in a special administrative region instead of a crown colony.I felt like my insides had been scooped out. But I mentally cauterized the dry socket behind my sternum finished cramming tangled clothes and small appliances into my Honda Civic waved shut the car door and drove off.Manhattan still reminds me of Hong Kong. And it’s not just the disparate population spellbinding skyline and internationally recognized address.I’m great at leaving. I am less talented at getting left though I should be better given how much it’s happened. Hong Kong was a train station set to techno and social circles depended on the location of your father’s employ. You could never rely on having the same friends year in and out. You never knew when your own number was going to get called. How expats process upheaval is where we differ from immigrants. There is a tacit understanding among us that maudlin goodbyes are indulgent and uncalled for.Hong Kong had a wildly diverse population of expatriates saying their unsentimental farewells. There were enough British French Germans and Americans that they all had their own primary and secondary schools. (I attended the English system with Korean school on Saturdays.) But the schools were not as balkanized as you’d expect. Not with such an efficient latchkey-kid-friendly public transportation system. Not when the legal drinking age of 18 was more suggestion than law and most of us by age 10 or 11 had experimented with inexpensive caustic rice wine mixed with sugary juice drink. Not when whole nightclubs were dominated by 13-year-olds trying to befriend 16-year-olds from across town. A successful night was judged by how many upperclassmen greeted you or hated your guts the following Monday. Both responses were regarded positively.We were emboldened by props that are only viewed as grown-up by children like Marlboro 100’s and near-neon triple-shot tequila sunrises in skinny glasses with black straws. We also had a thing for four-star hotel restaurants and were rarely booted from dining rooms despite brazenly filching canapés and plucking medium-rare medallions from lavish buffets with panoramic backdrops. To better blend in while filling our bellies we’d frequently strike up conversations with lone international travelers. Like an anthropologist I enjoyed hoarding the stories and idioms of these exotic strangers and the memories of their shoes.Now in New York when people skip states disappear into marriages and young families or simply get pruned along the way it can be difficult for me to feel anything beyond a distracted curiosity. Maybe the detachment is useful. Perhaps it only seems like a bad thing. Like holding the single allele of sickle-cell anemia that ends up heightening a resistance to malaria. All I know is that a force field makes navigation in a frenetic New York easier. As does the ability to cold read anyone you meet along the way then shape-shift your accent cadence syntax and semantics to best suit them.Jungyeon RohManhattan after eight years here still reminds me of Hong Kong. There are parts of Chinatown that are the spit and image of streets in Wan Chai and I am held in thrall by the Chrysler building as much as I was by I.M. Pei’s Bank of China Tower. But in the consolation facsimile I had first sought for superficial reasons — the dense disparate population spellbinding skyline internationally recognized address — I hadn’t considered the implication of the city’s pace or the composition of its inhabitants. I fit in. It’s not just that the ingrained muscle memory for social navigation and a hearty tolerance for alcohol acquired in Hong Kong turned out to be felicitous traits in New York. It’s that here sometimes I get to sound like myself.At a friend’s recent dinner party I met a British man who was born in Hong Kong and now lives in the West Village. He is the publisher and editor of a hardcover travel and food magazine and I immediately recognized the ease the voracity with which he navigated Asia and Europe as something familiar that special expat birthright. We knew many of the same people both here and in Hong Kong but had somehow always missed one other. We exasperated our host and alienated other guests by competitively peppering each other with Cantonese slang from the early ’90s. With him I did not modulate the corners of my consonants. Words clattered out at a clip that could not be checked for quality or calculation.In New York I find I am less watchful less greedy less restless. Besides I have finally acquired a handful of friends that I do not hold at arm’s length to analyze. And with them I do not secrete every meaningful thought away in the apothecary drawers in my brain. They ask me questions and I respond with answers not decoys or digressions. With them too especially when I’m angry or excited my language is unguarded. I am suddenly “chuffed” instead of proud “skint” in place of broke eat “crisps” and an “aiyah” may make an appearance to indicate alarm. They rib me about my guilelessly disclosed peripatetic hodgepodge my squirmy diphthongs and strange argot. But I am grateful that they get through my force field. I even tell them so.Mary H.K.

 5791,  1985, a, Orlando Pizzolato has become a minor celebrity the kind only a few people recognize.He arrived in New York Sunday for a week of promotional work for the Oct. 27 New York City Marathon which he won last year. Sunday night he ran in Central Park and if anyone's head turned when he passed he didn't notice it.''Nobody knows who I am'' he said yesterday. ''Nobody knows my face here. In Italy my name is famous. I like it when people come up to me and talk and take pictures and ask for my autograph. It hasn't happened enough to me not to like it.''It almost happened last week in Italy where Pizzolato ran in a series of races much like cycling's Tour de France. Everyone seemed to want to take his picture or get his autograph or have coffee with him. He wanted to run and train. He compromised - many pictures too much coffee and enough running to fill his needs.This will be his fourth New York City Marathon. In 1982 and 1983 his trips were financed by Champion the sportswear company that sponsors his club team. In 1982 he dropped out after 15 miles his legs as limp as spaghetti because this was his third marathon in five weeks. In 1983 he finished 27th high enough for the marathon sponsors to pay his expenses to the 1984 race.

 5111,  1989, a, ''He insisted on his own idea'' President Yang complained in the speech a copy of which was obtained from students and has been verified by people who heard it read in party meetings. ''When Comrade Deng Xiaoping attended the meeting he still insisted on his idea.''For Communist Party leaders who for decades have felt secure when a single voice emanated from the party there has been something deeply troubling about Mr. Zhao's unwillingness to be quiet. Mr. Zhao in his speeches never openly broke with his colleagues but his televised speeches were more conciliatory toward the protesters than those of other officials and President Yang appears convinced that this is what stimulated the democracy movement.The old revolutionaries seem to regard the public as having little or no independent vitality but are simply a weather vane to be directed by the force of the Communist Party or the force of opposing ''bourgeois liberalism'' whichever is greater. Their fear is that divisions within the party will strengthen the enemy.China's former President Li Xiannian complained that ''there are two headquarters'' in the party and that this confused people and encouraged unrest. While in the West there is a political tradition that glorifies the lone dissenter who sticks to his principles in the Politburo Mr. Zhao's persistence came across as impudence and treachery. The Question of a PlotIndeed there may be more to the situation than is now known and no one can rule out the possibility of Mr. Zhao plotting against Mr. Deng. A member of Mr. Zhao's camp confirmed that the party General Secretary had directly challenged Mr. Deng's authority and there are some hints that Mr. Zhao's aides may have tried to stir up unrest in the belief that it would help their man.In 1976 when it was to his advantage Mr. Zhao reacted to the purge of Mr. Deng by calling on the masses to ''thoroughly expose and criticize the crimes of Deng Xiaoping.'' On this occasion once again his own interests may have crossed Mr. Deng's.Mr. Deng and his comrades may have felt they had little choice but to take the actions they did if they were to hold on to the power they had grown used to. It was not necessarily a blunder - a miscalculation of the impact of suppression on Hong Kong on the succession plans or on China's domestic political stability - but a response to a higher imperative from the perspective of the old revolutionaries. They felt that it came down to the need to preserve their own power and also the need to save China.

 2948,  2002, a, The economy of Hong Kong continued to stagnate in the first quarter with output falling nine-tenths of a percent from a year earlier near the low end of economists' expectations. A small increase in exports of services notably a big jump in tourists from mainland China failed to offset record unemployment of 7 percent and sinking exports of goods. But the economy fared slightly better than it did in the fourth quarter when output shrank 1.4 percent compared with a year earlier.Keith Bradsher (NYT)

 2746,  2003, a, Farmers expect to expand the planting of genetically modified crops in the United States this year according to the results of a survey of farmers' intentions released yesterday by the Agriculture Department.The survey however indicated that farmers are shying away a bit from crops resistant to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide other than soybeans. The survey found that herbicide-resistant cotton would decline to 54 percent this year from 58 percent of total cotton acreage last year. Herbicide-resistant corn would increase only to 12 percent of acreage from 11 percent it predicted. The herbicide-resistant category includes brands besides those made by Monsanto but its Roundup-ready class accounts for most of them.It is not clear if the slowdown is a reaction to recent concerns that widespread use of Roundup-ready crops are causing some weeds to become resistant to the herbicide.A Monsanto spokeswoman said that the company's sales figures indicated that use of Roundup-ready corn and cotton was still growing.

 429,  2016, a, A Promise of StabilitySCO was responsible for licensing and monitoring Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu and judged him to be dependable even “exemplary” as one longtime case worker for the organization described him in a review according to the official who discussed the state register and who was briefed on documents that SCO has provided to child welfare authorities in recent weeks.A former wine distributor who became a full-time foster parent Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu filed for bankruptcy three years ago. In the court filing he listed his job as “Home Care Provider (Foster Care)” with an income of $6600 a month and assets that included a couple of classic cars: an MG Roadster and a Plymouth Savoy. SCO continued to place children with him throughout his financial difficulties and reliance on foster care stipends as his primary source of income.Indeed his home was always in demand. He was certified as a “therapeutic” foster parent deemed qualified to care for children with complex emotional needs. Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu was a single Latino man with a large house at the bottom of a suburban cul-de-sac and most of the children sent to him were also Latino. For social services agencies struggling to place vulnerable boys Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu’s profile seemed a perfect fit especially because of his willingness to take in so many boys most of them with emotional or developmental challenges.For many of the children who may have felt abandoned by their biological parents and had moved between homes Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu promised a stability they had never known. But investigators have found that he isolated the boys from the outside world and imposed rigid limits on their lives said Detective Lt. Robert Donohue commander of the Suffolk County Police Department’s Special Victims Section.The boys for example were forbidden to join after-school clubs play team sports or have girlfriends Lieutenant Donohue said. “It’s clear to me that he exercised this control over their lives in order to commit the atrocities which he did” he said.The biological father of one of the boys whom Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu adopted said he was shocked to learn after he and his son reunited that Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu had not only adopted his son and changed the boy’s surname but had also changed his given name. It was the authorities said a step he took with other children he adopted.

 2159,  2006, a, Yushchenko then is on the defensive harassed by a telegenic former partner who stands to represent those Orange Revolutionaries disappointed by the allegations of corruption in his camp and frustrated by his equivocations. (Three members of Yuschenko's circle have been accused of a variety of misbehavior including extorting control of a Kiev luxury apartment building helping business friends siphon money out of Ukraine's energy sector and trying to muscle in on media properties; the men were subsequently cleared by Ukraine's widely distrusted prosecutor general's office and by a special Parliament commission.) In the West Yushchenko is considered a responsible leader who appropriately has done with revolutionary passions. But in Ukraine many are not convinced that the revolution was waged just to make Ukraine a safe place to invest. These Ukrainians yearn for the crusade against corruption and the elite bandits that the revolution promised them.Tymoshenko embodies that crusade. She wants she says to "justify the faith" of the Orange Revolution's supporters. And given the March parliamentary elections as well as controversial changes to Ukraine's constitution she may soon be in a position to do so. Under the revised constitution Ukraine's Parliament - and no longer the president - will appoint and dismiss the prime minister. With this in mind Volodymyr Polokhalo a political analyst in Kiev gives Tymoshenko an even chance of again becoming prime minister this spring. And if she doesn't he gives her a 70 percent chance of becoming Ukraine's next president in 2009.Tymoshenko is a compelling mixture of ruthless calculation iron will and sincere passion. After hijacking the November anniversary rally she went on to weep onstage as Yushchenko in his own speech criticized her work as prime minister. In the spring of 2004 I watched Tymoshenko lead opposition forces to a huge parliamentary victory over the Kuchma regime. After a day of brutal politicking she wandered into the Parliament lobby and overcome by emotion wept in the arms of a female journalist a stranger to her. But only for a second. A moment later as reporters noticed her she had got control of herself leaving my moved colleague in tears herself.In person with her hallmark braids temporarily combed out and her honey blond hair hanging down around her face Tymoshenko looks fresh-faced and soft. She speaks quietly leaning over the table with a confiding air; an attentive listener she often breaks into peals of laughter. On a warm September day in her offices in a shabby Soviet high-rise in Kiev only the presence of her burly male handlers dispelled the impression that you are sitting with a charismatic grad student.She explained that Yushchenko made her prime minister because the people demanded it. The thesis is self-dramatizing but like many of the superambitious Tymoshenko's gestures it is charming in its very audacity."Until the last day I honestly didn't know whether he" - Yushchenko - "would put my candidacy forth as prime minister or not" she said. "When he arrived for the inauguration the square simply started chanting my name completely independent of my desires or his."The reference is to Yushchenko's inauguration day last January on which an oceanic Kiev crowd greeted Tymoshenko by chanting her name louder than it did Yushchenko's. Soon after she was indeed appointed prime minister and voted in by a huge parliamentary majority.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe difficulties started soon after. Even beyond Yushchenko and Tymoshenko the orange coalition was cobbled together from constituencies that often had little in common with one another except disgust with the Kuchma regime - the Kiev political analyst Dmytro Potekhin likens it to a group of people who converge to put out a fire. The administration broke down fast into mutually distrustful factions. If these were typical power struggles other controversies spoke to Ukraine's new self-image. The question was what kind of country was the revolution supposed to have created? For Ukraine's economic liberals and business community and for the free-marketers in the West it was expected that postrevolutionary Ukraine would be in the first place one welcoming to foreign capital a place of liberal economic reforms.Tymoshenko defied these liberals immediately. First she offended their idea of property rights by making noises about seizing - in the name of the state - dozens of factories and other enterprises that had been acquired in the post-Soviet era by tycoons Ukraine's so-called oligarchs. Many of these former Soviet properties had been auctioned off to insiders at very low prices and what critics perceive as the effective theft of them from the commonweal remains a national sore spot in Ukraine. The moderate Yushchenko for his part favored seizing - and reselling cleanly - just a small number of the most flagrantly stolen properties and perhaps as few as one.Next faced with rising consumer prices Tymoshenko intervened to control prices on meat and gasoline. This move raised the specter of socialism and embarrassed Yushchenko who was talking of Ukraine being recognized as a market economy and entering the World Trade Organization by year's end. Tymoshenko's government also irked economic liberals when it hiked state pensions and salaries.Kseniya Lyapina point woman for Yushchenko's faction in Parliament says baldly that Tymoshenko "worked toward only one goal: to be liked." Lyapina went on to tell me: "She messed up the economics because the economy is boring. It's not interesting; it's for the strategic future. But to be liked that's necessary today because the elections are tomorrow."And yet Tymoshenko's statism and populism do have appeal in a country in which even the young are not completely convinced of the need to jettison the entirety of their socialist inheritance. It is true that the youthful and heavily middle-class protesters of the Orange Revolution "didn't go out on Independence Square to ask for their pensions to be raised" in the words of Viktor Skarshevsky an economic adviser to Anatoly Kinakh a top member of the Ukrainian government. But neither did they take to the streets so that oligarchs could maintain their ownership of questionably obtained factories in the name of respecting property rights or that known Kuchma-era hacks could stay in office as they have in the Yushchenko administration.Tymoshenko's governance then may have been eclectic ad hoc and counterproductive. But to that extent it was a reflection of the complications of the Orange Revolution. The protesters of 2004 were not simply young entrepreneurs in waiting eager to embrace "freedom" and the global market. Those who took to the streets were guided in their revolutionary fervor not merely by aspirations of belonging to the W.T.O. but also by a conception of justice: as Skarshevsky puts it they desired an end to corruption and "normal simple human rules." Yushchenko now appears to many a compromised figure surrounded by supposedly corrupt allies and either unwilling or unable to strike the promised blows against Ukraine's criminals and corruption. He recently signed a political pact with his 2004 election opponent the former prime minister Viktor Yanukovych - that is he made a deal with the man in whose name the contest was rigged and on whose behalf Yushchenko himself was poisoned in an apparent assassination attempt. Such alliance-making might be practical politics but polls suggest that many Ukrainians want little part of it.All of this is significant because this poor sprawling nation of 47 million people now matters in a way it has not since the Soviet Union's collapse. Bordered by the European Union on the West and by a newly fractious Russia to the north and east Ukraine is today as it has been in the past a buffer space over which empires eye each other warily."In Ukraine the stakes are incredibly high" says Oksana Antonenko a senior fellow on Russia and Eurasia at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies. New E.U. member states like Poland and Hungary that have traumatic cultural memories of Russian dominance Antonenko says see Ukraine as "a symbolic issue for stopping Russia's post-Soviet neoimperialism." This is a neoimperialism that worries Ukraine - a place that even today many Russians have a hard time imagining as something other than the southern portion of their own country. Europe for its part has everything to gain from stability on its borders.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMeanwhile Ukraine has also become a vehicle for American ambitions. Washington Antonenko says would love to see a successful and populous democratic state on Russia's borders and Ukraine is "the only candidate in the post-Soviet space" with a chance of becoming one. Then there's Ukraine's proximity to the oil- and gas-rich Caspian basin over access to which China Russia and the U.S. have begun to compete. If Caspian oil is to flow westward without passing through Russia something Washington would like to see happen then Ukraine with its Black Sea ports and good pipeline networks could play a role as a transit point. So Washington is not eager to lose Ukraine if Tymoshenko whom Antonenko says the West considers a loose cannon should grow more powerful. Her economic policies have market liberals and globalizers apoplectic. Anders Aslund of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has advised the Ukrainian and Russian governments on economic issues; he calls her "anti-internationalist" and "socialistic or statist and populist." He says "you have to go to Uganda" to find governance as bad as hers.Tymoshenko was not always a crusader. In fact before she transformed herself into the scourge of Ukraine's tycoon class in the first years of this century she was a member of it herself: the head of a well-connected company called United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU) that made spectacular profits from 1995 through 1997 during Ukraine's "Wild East" days. Her rebranding of herself as a populist fighter then is one of the stranger stories in Eastern European politics.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was also a money machine that functioned under the protection of its patron Pavlo Lazarenko a powerful Dnipropetrovsk native son. Lazarenko who was Ukraine's prime minister from spring 1996 to summer 1997 and deputy prime minister before that employed crude Soviet-style administrative fiats to award UESU more than 50 percent of Ukraine's energy imports. Andrey Zolotaryov a political consultant who worked with UESU says that the corporation combined "the spirit of a capitalist enterprise" with "the smell of a regional Communist Party committee." UESU he explains was less a business than "a rod with which to catch a golden fish in the murky water of the post-Soviet economy."Tymoshenko and her husband and business partner Aleksandr (they married when she was 19) made the most of these circumstances. (The couple are now amicably separated but still married.) By her mid-30's the daughter of a single mother who had toiled on Dnipropetrovsk's trolley system had become Eastern Europe's one and only "lady oligarch." Whether UESU dealings were "illegal" by the Wild East standards of the ex-Soviet Union in the 1990's - the political analyst Volodymyr Polokhalo speaks of the "total corruption" of the era - is a difficult question.In 1996 Tymoshenko was elected to Parliament with Lazarenko's support. But her patron's star was on the wane and three years later she left his party and started her own which was called Fatherland. Lazarenko embarked on a downward spiral that led to his 2004 conviction in California on money-laundering charges. He is arguing for the reversal of his conviction. Tymoshenko meanwhile would at the end of 1999 take what was for her and Ukraine a fateful step. President Kuchma now eager to curry favor in the West hired as prime minister Viktor Yushchenko the former head of the National Bank. Yushchenko was young uncorrupted and above all internationally presentable. Tymoshenko joined Yushchenko's cabinet as deputy prime minister for energy issues.Because she knew its tricks Tymoshenko proved an effective reformer of Ukraine's lucrative and filthy energy sector - perhaps too effective. Her brash reforms brought a huge tranche of Ukraine's shadow economy into the light. But her assaults on the prerogatives of Ukraine's crooked energy titans her former peers made her an irritant to the regime. She had to go. In mid-January 2001 Ukraine's top prosecutor accused her of having engaged in extortion money laundering and other crimes while heading UESU. The charges Polokhalo the analyst says had an obvious "political character." "You could bring such charges against all the big businessmen of the 1990's" he explains. Kuchma fired her that same month.After Tymoshenko left the cabinet she became head of the National Salvation Forum a new civic coalition dedicated to forcing President Kuchma from office. The pressure on the Ukrainian leader was growing. Secret audiotapes implicated him in the disappearance of a muckraking journalist who ended up murdered prompting a series of street protests aimed at toppling him. (The tapes also show Kuchma threatening to destroy Tymoshenko.) In February 2001 Tymoshenko was arrested at her house outside Kiev and spent six weeks in the city's notorious Lukyanivka prison. Later the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe found that Tymoshenko had been denied necessary medical treatment and kept in solitary confinement.Jailing Tymoshenko in the hope of silencing her turned out to be a strategic mistake. She was already a high-profile critic of Kuchma. Now as she emerged from prison - poised emaciated and fragilely beautiful - she had acquired a new glamour. It was then that people started calling her Ukraine's Joan of Arc.The sincerity of Tymoshenko's conversion is widely accepted by Ukraine's public. She has paid for it not only with jail time but also with years of harassment by the Kuchma regime and its allies. Chief among them was the Kremlin an aggressive opponent of Ukraine's orange movement. At the height of the revolution in December 2004 Tymoshenko was briefly listed as wanted on the Interpol Web site in response to a Russian warrant connected with UESU-era charges. Early in her tenure as prime minister there was media speculation over whether Tymoshenko could visit Moscow without being arrested.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAt home too she has until recently been dogged by what Polokhalo calls politically motivated investigations into long-past supposed misdeeds. The last of the investigations were closed only six weeks ago when a Kiev court dismissed them for lack of evidence.More relevant perhaps than her old business dealings are the charges that Tymoshenko is at heart a state socialist. Skarshevky an adviser to Anatoly Kinakh a top Yushchenko administration member called her economically speaking a "pure Bolshevik." Volodymyr Kulyk senior research fellow at the Institute of Political and Ethnic Studies at the National Academy of Sciences in Kiev says Tymoshenko is apt to exploit a blunt credo: "Take it away and share it."One thing that bothers people who would like to see Ukraine run by Western-style liberal technocrats is Tymoshenko's intensely personal political vision. It is a vision indeed of a female martyr figure keenly exploiting what Kulyk calls a "trope of betrayal." Kulyk glosses her stance this way: "Because I fought for you I suffer for you. They persecute me because I'm dangerous because I fight for you." When she spoke with me about her dismissal as prime minister Tymoshenko smiling tenderly and with her dark eyes softening sketched out a narrative in which she played the abused spouse who was trying to keep it together with a bum for the sake of the kids."I appealed to the president that he not create such a risk and shock and that he not dismiss the government because it's not logical and it's very cruel to Ukraine and those people who stood out on Independence Square" she told me. "We haven't the right to rip apart the hearts of the people" she said adding that she "wasn't planning to wage war with the president. It's not my war. I didn't go out for it."It's odd to hear state politics so reduced to the emotional. Similarly curious was her assertion of the inevitability of her free-market commitments. "As a person who worked for a period of time as a very big businessman I can't be illiberal" she said. But United Energy Systems of Ukraine was a crony operation with at best a glancing relationship to the liberal economy.It is also often charged that Tymoshenko evinces a certain paranoid streak. This came up in our conversation too. "From the moment I was made the prime minister" Tymoshenko told me "they hired the most powerful P.R. agencies all over the world the goal of which was simply to discredit me as prime minister." The themes of this negative public-relations campaign she claimed were her renationalization policies her social program and her clothes. "They say that maybe I have too fine dresses for a prime minister" she said with a laugh.At the rally in November Yushchenko's new prime minister Yuriy Yekhanurov was greeted with shouts of "shame shame" when he took the stage. Shame one of the shouting men explained because he had had the temerity to replace Yulia. It may or may not be shameful but it is a fact in Ukraine that there exists frustration with the Yushchenko team's abdication of the idea that the revolution was significantly meant to exact justice from a criminal elite.In a narrow political field - there is almost no one else approaching Tymoshenko's or Yushchenko's stature in Ukraine - Tymoshenko despite or because of her quirks is the leader who can channel that frustration. Nestor Shufrych a colorful legislator in the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine which was loyal to the Kuchma government says that Tymoshenko's firing was the birth of an "orange opposition" to Yushchenko - even though a crafty Tymoshenko has not ruled out reconciliation with the president. The Orange Revolution "was supported by two pillars" Shufrych says. "One was Tymoshenko a granite one and the second was Yushchenko and that one was clay. It's probably not an accident that Tymoshenko began her career developing granite quarries and Yushchenko likes to make whistle toys out of clay." The reference is to one of Tymoshenko's pre-UESU enterprises and to Yushchenko's well-known enthusiasm for Ukrainian peasant crafts.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyShufrych is correct in pointing out that there can be "no competition" between the former allies when it comes to political skill. Nikita Poturaev a political consultant who worked with Tymoshenko in the past theorizes that she is a scientific adept of hypnosis and secretly charms the followers over whom she holds such powerful sway. In a talk-show appearance after her firing Tymoshenko demure in mauve spewed forth a stream of humiliating allegations against Yushchenko's circle - and with an eyelash-batting innocence that in Parliament the next week earned her a sarcastic nomination to the ranks of Ukraine's official state actors.As Ukrainians approach the parliamentary elections that are widely expected to put Tymoshenko back in the Legislature and strengthen the representation of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc the question comes up: What finally does the political dynamo that is Tymoshenko want? When I asked what her Ukraine would look like she answered vaguely that it would "look like a country where every person wants to come and live and invest money." She added "It will be a country that will be able to be an example of how a country should look after a revolution."Her Ukraine would almost certainly be one less inclined toward economic liberalism and less concerned with the West's opinion. It would not always be a team player as regards either its historic patron Russia or the West. It would be possibly eclectic in its policies and allegiances. But to that extent it could be expressive of the complicated allegiances of its population - caught between Russia and Western Europe; between the dreams of its socialist past and the specter of its market-capitalist future; between a desire to be part of the action of the West and a sense that the West is perhaps foreign. Finally it would be a country in which the effort to eliminate dirty money would be on some level a principle of governance.But would it be a country led by a crusader - a country once again thrown into turmoil?"It's possible that if today I went out on the square" she told me "then on the square there'd stand possibly twice as many people as stood during our revolution." But she quickly added "I'll never do that."She smiled warmly and brought up a production of "Joan of Arc" that was mounted several years ago at a Kiev theater. It was "a colossal success" she told me. "But the ending differed the plot differed. No one burned anyone in a fire in it they kind of changed it." She laughed. "Everyone stayed alive and healthy and everything in general was all right."

 2842,  2003, a, A parliamentarian Martin Hohmann of the conservative Christian Democrats has refused to apologize for saying that Jews could be described as a ''race of perpetrators'' for their role in the Russian Revolution. In an Oct. 3 speech in Neuhof his hometown Mr. Hohmann compared the killings in Russia's violent 1917 revolution which he said were orchestrated by Jewish Bolsheviks with the murder of Europe's Jews during the Holocaust. Jewish leaders and members of all Germany's political parties have condemned the remarks and deputies from Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Social Democrats have called for Mr. Hohmann's dismissal from Parliament.

 4986,  1990, a, MY barbecues this summer have featured much more pork than beef. Pork is a tender and mild meat that can be enhanced by all sorts of marinades.It demands careful cooking however. The harmful parasites that may exist call for cooking the meat to an internal temperature of 180 degrees. If you do not have a meat thermometer you can check by piercing the meat. The juices should run clear.In this recipe boneless pork medallions trimmed of fat are marinated in olive oil lemon juice white wine mustard garlic cumin rosemary sage salt and pepper. The meat is cooked on the grill for about 15 minutes turning occasionally.I like to heat the marinade and bind it with a little butter. The cooked meat is then placed in this before serving becoming more tender.

 4142,  1995, a, The President Ronald Reagan had just raised his left arm to wave to the crowd standing on the rain swept sidewalk outside the Washington Hilton Hotel when John W. Hinckley Jr. opened fire. It was March 30 1981. Mr. Hinckley a 25-year-old mentally disturbed gun enthusiast fired six shots at the Presidential entourage. Mr. Reagan suffered a near-fatal wound to the chest. His press secretary James S. Brady was hit above the left eye. Two other men were wounded. It was an old old story. The insanity of gun violence a crippling and seemingly incurable American disease had flared again.Fourteen years later the National Rifle Association a fanatical organization that is awash in the blood of homicide and suicide victims is accelerating its never-ending fight to expand the arsenal of guns in America. Weapons manufacturers in the U.S. are turning out more than 500 guns an hour but the N.R.A. and its political henchmen are not satisfied. With the leadership of the Republican Party in its pocket the N.R.A. is fighting for the repeal of virtually all existing gun control laws including the ban on assault weapons.Never mind that all of us are at risk from the President to the poorest infant in the poorest neighborhood in the land. Never mind that 37502 people were killed by firearms in the U.S. in 1992 -- more than 100 every day. Never mind that Colin Ferguson was able to legally purchase the 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun that he used to kill 6 people and wound 19 others on a Long Island commuter train. Never mind that 14 people were shot to death in a post office in Oklahoma in 1986 or that 21 people were shot to death in a McDonald's in California in 1984 or that 4 people were shot to death in a post office in Montclair N.J. just last week.Never mind any of that. The goal of the N.R.A. remains as simple and as mad as ever: to put guns into the hands of as many Americans as possible.

 4255,  1994, a, Under the Trading With the Enemy Act it has been illegal since 1963 for any U.S. company to do business with Cuba. Yet Cargill Inc. a giant agricultural trader is accused of arranging for the sale of Cuban sugar to Venezuela in 1988 through its Swiss subsidiary Cargill International. But as The Times's Dean Baquet reports at only one point is Cargill vulnerable to U.S. laws -- the Swiss subsidiary obtained its dollar-denominated financing from the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro presumptively violating embargo laws.This is the same Atlanta bank whose chief officer Christopher Drogoul was indicted in 1991 on charges of granting multi-billion dollar loans to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The Cuban sugar sale was cited in the Justice Department charges and Cargill executives in Minnesota and Switzerland were named as co-conspirators but not indicted.It stretches belief that the company's Geneva subsidiary acted primarily on its own as Cargill's attorneys claim. Still from what is known this is less a scandal than a commentary on the difficulty of proving collusion in sanctions cases. Enforcement is especially difficult when an embargo is imposed by the United States alone which it does against Cuba Vietnam Libya and North Korea. In a global economy foreign subsidiaries of multinational companies are subject to laws of host countries beyond the reach of the Justice Department or the U.S. Congress. This limitation is essential to the orderly functioning of a global economy. Imagine the indignation in America if foreign subsidiaries were ordered by another government to refuse all sales to Israel.But the legal autonomy of foreign subsidiaries enormously complicates enforcement of any unilateral embargo. That applies doubly when other countries perceive U.S. trade restrictions as unreasonable or unfair. Cuba is a case in point. Evasions became so widespread that in 1992 Congress tightened existing sanctions and expressly barred foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-based corporations from doing business with the Castro regime. Though this has cut some trade Britain Canada and other major trading countries have protested the law's extraterritorial reach and decline to enforce it.

 591,  2015, a, PhotoSeason 5 Episode 9Oh Abbots. It can’t be over can it? Another season gone as quickly as a grouse flying over Brancaster Castle.So let us keep sorrow at bay by reminding ourselves: We’ve finally pulled abreast. Oh sure those viewers in Britain got their usual three-month head start on us (just as the Brits used to get first crack at the latest Dickens installment). Viewers in the United States who were too impatient to wait for the weekly drip of revelation snapped up their DVDs and sometimes blurted out key plot developments over a few too many Manhattans. They had us in their spoiler-alert grip Abbots but no longer. Democracy reigns.So now that we’re all on the same plane of knowledge what can we say for sure about this fast-receding season? (For Baron Fellowes’ thoughts read this.)Longstanding relationships (the Bateses Robert and Cora) were tested and left standing. Longstanding plot lines were either resolved (Edith’s daughter) or abruptly discarded (Mary Crawley’s sort-of-not-really love triangle). Characters like Violet the dowager countess were enlarged with new layers and backstories; others showed clear signs of outliving their narrative usefulness. From all indications we haveseen the last of:1) Mary’s dim suitor Tony Gillingham (Tom Cullen) who gets a fine consolation prize in Mabel Lane Fox (Catherine Steadman).2) Boston-bound Tom Branson (Allen Leech) who has taken longer to quit the scene than Cher.3) Rose (Lily James) and Atticus (Matt Barber) who are heading off to New York. (Synchronously Ms. James has veered off toward “Cinderella” a part she seems genetically modified for.)One way or another the Downton family is fragmenting. Just like the Downton estate (headed for subdivision) and the Downton ethos a victim to those winds of sociopolitical change that Carson (Jim Carter) keeps mumbling on about. As servants like Daisy (Sophie McShera) begin to imagine better lives as Socialists like Sarah Bunting make scenes in fine dining rooms as Edwardian ideals give way to harsh postwar realities (excellent historical timeline here) look for the Crawleys and their retinues to feel and fight their own anachronism.We know they’ll lose but what’s a historical drama without gallant fools engaged in rear-guard actions? So carry on you lovely maddening elitists along with your lovely maddening retinues. We’ll be griping and grumbling and we’ll be watching.In the meantime may I suggest just one incremental reform? On the evidence of Episode 9 you need better legal counsel.I’m sure the Earl of Grantham’s lawyer George Murray (Jonathan Coy) has a few gray cells poking around in there but several years after botching the defense of Bates (Brendan Coyle) he seems bound and determined to do the same with Mrs. Bates (Joanne Froggatt) even going so far as to declare the police case against her airtight when — as we all know Abbots — it has more holes than well a grouse flying over Brancaster Castle.Turns out that when Anna was a teenager she cut her stepfather-molester with a knife and while she was never charged that mysteriously reconstructed incident has created some kind of — oh I don’t know “pattern” of violence that will sweep Anna straight to the gallows and in the name of Perry Mason can’t some fine lawyerly mind sweep this whole business to sea? Instead it falls to Bates (Mr. Coyle) to confess to Mr. Green’s murder and then vamoose to Ireland.Now if Sarah Bunting were still around I would point out to her that even without benefit of a welfare state no one enjoys better job security than the Bateses. It doesn’t matter how much leave they take or how many heinous crimes they’re accused of their jobs are always kept open their home fires are kept burning and free (if incompetent) legal care abounds. Sweden could do no better.At any rate Anna is sprung on bail and Murray declares “We’re going forward and not backward” but to me it feels like we’re on the same leaking story pontoon which only stays afloat because Baron Fellowes’ legs are kicking as madly as they can. By episode’s end even he must be a little fatigued because a York publican turns up to give Bates an alibi and the witness who ID’d Anna sprouts “doubts” and lo and behold it’s Christmas and who should pop out of the mistletoe as it were but Bates?My first impulse was to wonder if he was a ghost. My second was to marvel at the freedom with which wanted felons limped about in that pre-TSA era. “We’ll worry about everything else later” Bates croons to his missus. Which is maybe what Baron Fellowes murmurs to himself just before bed. Given the Bateses’ amorous Noel clinch it’s hard to believe any contraceptive package will come into play tonight. (Twenty to one the resulting child is called Holly. Or Ivy.)Love emerges when you least expect it Abbots. Sometimes all it takes (and this will give aid and comfort to Freudians everywhere) is for a lot of men to pull out their big guns. The Sinderbys have rented Brancaster for a weeklong shooting party and no one is immune. Even Edith (Laura Carmichael) loses a bit of her Mildred Pierce-y daughter fixation and dances a few rounds with agreeable castle agent Bertie Pelham (Harry Hadden-Paton). We wish them both well. (And by the way Edith needs to let that hair flow. With her locks down to her shoulders she goes from librarian to licentious.)But no one is more moved by the sight of men and their gauges than Lady Mary Crawley (Michelle Dockery) who finds herself unaccountably aroused by the marksmanship of a handsome stranger named Henry Talbot.Now I don’t mean to crow but as soon as I heard Matthew Goode was signed up for the final episode I immediately discerned that his plot function would be roughly the same as it was in “The Good Wife”: to melt the froideur of a stern ashen erotically complicated brunette. Sure enough he shows up on the Northumberland moors without even an establishing close-up but with enough swagger to remind us that Mary needs a chap who looks as good as Tony G but treats her as roughly as Inspector Vyner.“Heavens” exclaims Mary watching Talbot climb into his car. “What a snappy chariot.” Now I would’ve thought she’d be a little skittish of automobiles given how her late husband met his end but she seems to be all over Henry T and his Bentley.Amazing to think Abbots that after two seasons of arid flirtation and Liverpool lovefests Our Miss Flint has found someone to spark off. And the secret to his allure? He doesn’t give a damn if she likes him or not. Look for Talbot to stick around.Love doesn’t bloom for all the Downton-ites. Isobel (Penelope Wilton) briefly holds out hope that the sons of Lord Merton (Douglas Reith) will allow her marriage to go forward but that’s snuffed out by the arrival of Larry Grey’s letter. “I suppose you’ll take it lying down” mutters Violet. “I’ll take it lying down” answers Isobel “standing up or in a semi-recumbent posture.” And if Lord M knew how kinky she was he’d have proposed a lot sooner.An even more illicit love lies squirreled away in the wormy soul of Lord Sinderby (James Faulkner). Through the machinations of Barrow (who has decided to use his powers for — well a more acceptable evil) Lord S is confronted with his mistress and love child. The day is saved by Rose of all people who sallies in with the Crawleys to palisade the girlfriend in good manners but why may I ask is Lord S ordering out for sex when he’s got a wife who can make the act of reading a book look like foreplay?Love’s a tricky business Abbots and to Violet (Maggie Smith) it brings only the prospect of ruin. Years ago she tried to elope with Prince Kuragin (Rade Serbedzija) only to be waylaid by the Princess Kuragin who dragged her out of the carriage flung her into a cab and sent her back to her husband. (Which sort of conflicts with how Violet previously portrayed the affair’s end — remember the Fabergé photo frames? — but never mind.) Violet is extremely grateful not to have become a Tolstoy heroine and that’s why she’s worked so hard to reunite the prince with his long-lost wife (Jane Lapotaire).Here is where I register my sadness that the producers couldn’t find an actress of Dame Maggie’s stature to play Princess K. (Imagine her squaring off with Helen Mirren who’s got Russian blood in those fire-and-ice veins.) Here is where I register my surprise that Prince K in the course of putting on his borrowed tux failed to wash his hair. Maybe it’s just as well that Violet dispatches her old beau to Paris with a kiss-off that Garbo would have relished: “It’s how it must be.” In the aftermath at any rate a little Mae West creeps in. “I will never again receive an immoral proposition from a man. Was I so wrong to savor it?”Best scene: Confess. Your eyes were more than a little damp by the time Carson got around to proposing to Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan). It’s a well-written and superbly played moment years in coming. And don’t you love the vulnerability that wells out of Carson as he awaits his love’s reply? I was figuring Mrs. H would put things off for another two or three seasons but out she comes with “Of course I’ll marry you you old booby.” We’ll assume she’s alluding to the adorable seabird and we’ll cross fingers that Baron Fellowes actually lets them kiss before too much longer.Best line: Preparing to lay waste to the local grouse population the enigmatic Charlie Rogers (Sebastian Dunn) asks “Would it be awful if I were left alone with my loader?” No sir. And if Clint Eastwood ever makes the film of “British Sniper” we’ll send him your way. But my favorite moment comes courtesy of who else Violet? When Robert (Hugh Bonneville) expresses surprise that she’s come to the train station to see the family off she snaps “Why do you always talk of me as if I were a salmon who laid my eggs in the gravel and then swam back to the sea?” Extra credit to Lady Mary for chiming in: “You’re very maternal aren’t you Granny? When it suits you.”This week’s drinking game: A glass of hard cider for every time the Sinderbys’ butler Stowell (Alun Armstrong) disses Tom. And a dram of pity for Stowell who can’t help it if he has a heart two sizes too small.I Google so you don’t have to: A thieves’ kitchen according to Merriam-Webster is “a slum or other area harboring thieves where children are easily led into crime.” Think Oliver Twist.Department of other stuff….* Kudos to the cinematographer Michael McDonough for the stunning moorland vistas.* Is it me or has Atticus’s hair color lightened since his wedding? Is that what comes from rubbing against Rose?* Lots of “meta” lines tonight. “We’re not having another crisis are we?” (Mrs. Patmore) “There’s a point Spratt when malice ceases to be amusing.” (Violet) “Nothing is more tedious than other people’s misfortunes.” (Prince K) As for Lord Merton’s dictum it should be stamped onto the Crawley family crest: “If you’re going to be miserable you might as well do it in charming surroundings.”* Robert was being so damned sweet and at the same time wincing so hard I was certain they were going to fell him before the last grouse dropped. Instead they gave him an ulcer. For no clear reason except to get him soused for Christmas.* More suspenseful even than Earl G’s health is the question that hovers over each season’s finale: Which actors will get bored in the interim and want out of their contracts? I’m just saying that if Sophie McShera decided to be one of them I would support her 100 percent.So one last time Abbots … speak. What are your fondest wishes for Season 6? Do you believe Mary has found the man to replace Matthew? Will the Bateses have junior Bateses? Will the junior Bateses be charged with murder? Will Barrow (Rob James-Collier) sow love instead of hate? Will Lady Flintshire be shot during the next grouse hunt? And when Denker (Sue Johnston) asks how she’s supposed to get rid of the scum are we certain she’s talking about the broth?Till the gong calls us back. …Louis Bayard is the author of “Roosevelt’s Beast” “The Pale Blue Eye” and “Mr. Timothy.”

 2213,  2006, a, HONOLULU March 31 — Heavy rains and a giant sewage spill near Waikiki Beach left residents here beating back floodwaters on Friday and tourists playing board games and watching movies in their hotels.Several hundred yards of beaches in Honolulu from Ala Moana Park to the military's Hale Koa Hotel in Waikiki were closed to swimmers for a second day because of high bacteria levels and the rain refused to let up. Five of Oahu's six public golf courses the Honolulu Zoo and a popular botanical garden were also closed because of flooding.It has been more than 50 years since Hawaii has had a drenching like the current one. Friday was the 41st day of rain in the Hawaiian Islands and ended one of the wettest Marches on record. The rain began Feb. 19 and has brought with it flash floods landslides mudslides and a dam break on Kauai that killed seven people four of whom are still missing."It's really kind of a once-in-a-lifetime situation" said Jim Weyman a meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office in Honolulu who attributed the rain to a deep upper-level trough of low pressure just west of the islands. "It makes the air over the Hawaiian Islands unstable."PhotoA sewer line on the back side of Waikiki broke March 24 and the city had to divert the wastewater to the Ala Wai canal until Wednesday some 48 million gallons over the five and a half days instead of allowing it to back up into homes hotels and businesses said Bill Brennan a spokesman for the City of Honolulu. The canal leads to the ocean near Waikiki Beach.Advertisement Continue reading the main story"If wastewater backed up into those areas it would have been catastrophic and certainly devastating" Mayor Mufi Hannemann told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.

 3887,  1997, a, Unemployment stands at 4.9 percent and has touched a 23-year low of 4.8 percent several times this year. Many economists believe that sustained unemployment of less than 5.5 percent ultimately leads employers to raise wages to attract workers leading in turn to higher prices as companies pass their higher labor costs along to consumers -- a phenomenon that has been noticeably absent in the economy this year.Fed officials as well as most private economists have consistently forecast slowdowns in the economy over the last 18 months that have either not materialized or proved transitory. If there is no sign by the end of the year that the economy is cooling off the pressure on the Fed to tighten policy by a notch is sure to grow analysts said.''They always see a slowdown around the corner or under way'' said David Hensley an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York.There are only the faintest signs of even preliminary inflation pressures building. The rate at which factories are operating for example has been creeping upward and last month stood at 83.9 percent of capacity just below the level economists consider an early warning signal of production bottlenecks that can lead to higher prices.The Fed's policy-making committee met at the same time that the Senate Banking Committee began considering President Clinton's nominees to fill two vacancies on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board.The nominees Roger W. Ferguson Jr. and Edward M. Gramlich both stressed in their testimony to the committee that they considered achieving price stability to be the Fed's primary mission. Their statements were unsurprising given that the Republican-controlled Senate would probably not be willing to confirm them if they did not publicly place price stability ahead of the Fed's other legislatively mandated mission promoting maximum employment.But both Mr. Ferguson a specialist in banking and technology for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company and Mr. Gramlich dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan hinted that they saw the Fed as a pulpit to promote other goals as well.

 537,  2016, a, April 2012 Glaxo executives in China begin hearing that a whistle-blower has been sending documents to Chinese regulators claiming widespread corruption at the company.July 2012 The company pleads guilty in the United States to criminal charges for improper drug marketing and kickbacks to doctors. The company’s chief executive Sir Andrew Witty pledges that it “is never going to happen again.”December 2012 Vivian Shi the head of government affairs for Glaxo in China is fired supposedly for falsifying travel expenses. But the real reason according to internal documents is that Ms. Shi is suspected of being the whistle-blower.January 2013 The whistle-blower sends a 5200-word email to the Glaxo chairman senior executives and the company’s outside auditor. The email like the previous ones to authorities describes a systemic fraud and bribery scheme. The allegations are dismissed by the company as a “smear campaign.”

 4173,  1995, a, Philip W. Bonsal a career diplomat and the last United States Ambassador to Cuba died Wednesday in his home here. He was 92.He had been under treatment for pneumonia.When Mr. Bonzal arrived in Havana in February 1959 as Ambassador relations between the United States and the revolutionary Castro Government had already begun to deteriorate. But stepping off the plane Mr. Bonsal shook hands with a bearded Castro emissary and congratulated him on the bravery of the revolutionaries who had overthrown the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista which had been backed by Washington for many years.The act was widely noted in the Cuban press and Prime Minister Fidel Castro later the Cuban President expressed appreciation for his "friendly cordial" approach.Despite this auspicious beginning Mr. Bonsal was unable to develop a dialogue with the revolutionary and as nationalization of American-owned companies proceeded his counsel of quiet negotiation was largely ignored in Washington.

 2782,  2003, a, The sidewalks of New York have their own song. Broadway has several. Well-known plays and movies have been set in or inspired by among many other New York locations the Waldorf the Plaza Wall Street Macy's Yankee Stadium Tiffany & Company Katz's Delicatessen and the late Cammareri Brothers Bakery in Carroll Gardens Brooklyn.But for all its importance to the city over the last 98 years the subway has been given relatively short shrift by the performing arts. Of course there are exceptions like ''Take the A Train'' and ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three'' and the great scenes in ''The French Connection.'' But the only major Broadway play with subway in the title ''Subways Are for Sleeping'' flopped in 1962 and the last big-budget movie set in the subway ''Money Train'' did not receive a warm critical reception. (''If this is not the end of the road for the cop buddy movie'' Roger Ebert lamented ''maybe it should be.'')As a hard-working muse and epic urban protagonist the subway surely deserves far better from the creative community however and so very recently some of its New York members have set about trying to redress this wrong.In May for example the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre staged ''theAtrainplays'' a group of three short musicals and three one-act plays.
 4816,  1991, a, On the eve of his first venture into the heated world of Soviet politics in the provinces President Bush was denounced today by the Ukraine's leading independence movement as having been "hypnotized by Gorbachev" at the summit meeting.The Ukrainian popular movement known as Rukh the umbrella group for more than a dozen of the republic's opposition parties offered Mr. Bush an advance sample of the sharp-edged politics that await him in this rich sprawling republic which the President will visit on Thursday on his way home from Moscow.Ukrainian politicians cautioned him today to expect the six-hour visit to be no easy folksy photo opportunity.Ivan Drach the Rukh chairman said Mr. Bush was so supportive and uncritical of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Mr. Bush would arrive here as the Soviet leader's "messenger" with no real appreciation of the suffering that the Ukrainian republic has seen under the Kremlin because of its yearning for independence.

 3670,  1998, a, A LITTLE cheese biscuit from Brazil called pao de queijo is quietly building a big following in Manhattan. Baskets of the golden puffy biscuits are showing up in trendy Latin restaurants from Churrascaria Plataforma in midtown to Coffee Shop the Brazilian cafe on Union Square. But the ones made at Good and Plenty the catering and takeout shop at 410 West 43d Street are particularly irresistible.''People go crazy for the biscuits; I can never serve enough'' said Eileen Weinberg the owner who credits one of her cooks Maria Helena Ramos with the recipe for pao de queijo (pronounced PAOWN de KAY-ju) which means ''bread of cheese'' in Portuguese.Ms. Ramos who is from Belo Horizonte Brazil makes a variation of the traditional recipe a combination of manioc flour mild Parmesan cheese eggs and milk.The manioc flour is what makes these biscuits different from the usual wheat flour or yeast varieties which depending on the skill of the baker tend to be either flaky or leaden. Manioc flour is ground from a tropical tuber called cassava. It makes a temperamental dough -- as sticky as molasses and as stretchy as a rubber band -- but it is responsible for the distinctive spongy texture of the biscuits.
 691,  2015, a, PARIS — On Wednesday Virgil Abloh the rising street wear designer and creative director for Kanye West staged the first presentation for his Off-White line in a gallery in the Marais. It was an extended meditation on the white T-shirt and jeans — jeans made both in his Italian factories and by collaboration with Levi’s white T-shirts split and reworked inserted with shoulder pads pleated and Frankensteined together. Mr. Abloh a gregarious and enthusiastic designer was in a chatty mood backstage. Here five things to know about his collection in his own words.He is here to revitalize the jaded.“The whole show was based around this premise this writing on the wall: ‘Why are you here?’ It’s my synopsis of fashion week. After the first show you go out to dinner and say ‘What did you see?’ Everyone’s like ‘Oh nothing.’ ‘What’s really great?’ ‘Oh nothing.’ That’s why I started designing. It’s up to us to design something that’s good for people to look at. We can’t just complain.”But he’s not doing it on his own.“Everyone’s always like ‘Don’t do a show when you start.’ Shows are boring. I feel like doing it small repeating it trying to make it a different type of experience — it’s more like performance art. I flew out my friends from New York and we just sat at dinner and thought of it over wine. I feel like I’m just representing a group of kids rather than being a designer who’s totalitarian. It feels rewarding. I feel like I’m just a vessel for the young fashion kid getting into culture.”

 5875,  1983, a, President Reagan began 1983 with a plea that the nation get its drunken drivers ''off our roads and get them off now.''''If we insist long enough and loudly enough we can save lives so I thought it appropriate to start the ball rolling on this the first day of the new year'' the President said today in his weekly radio address.The New Year's Day speech was recorded for broadcast today hours after New Year's Eve celebrations.25000 Die Each YearThe President said that approximately 25000 lives are lost each year in alcohol-related accidents and 650000 more people are seriously injured in such crashes. He said alcohol was a factor in 55 percent of fatal automobile accidents.
 5272,  1988, a, Stanford University reached the College World Series for the fifth time in seven years today. A 16-2 victory over Kentucky the second over the Wildcats in two days allowed the defending champion Cardinal to win the Northeast region of the national collegiate tournament and continue a tradition that is as challenging as it is happy.After winning the double-elimination tournament following an opening-game loss and after having to defeat the Wildcats twice with freshman starting pitchers the Cardinal players realize that the hard part has not yet begun.The College World Series starts Friday. And so do final examinations. ''I've got to take them home and try to figure out how we're going to take finals'' said Mark Marquess the Stanford coach. ''I want my seniors to graduate and the rest of the team to be back next fall.'' On the BrinkFour days ago the Cardinal (41-22) nearly avoided a conflict between the National Collegiate Athletic Association baseball calendar and the end of Stanford's academic quarter. Last Friday the Cardinal lost to St. John's and was tied with Fordham in the eighth inning.

 3138,  2001, a, Remarkably even his association with Mussolini's Fascist regime from 1922 to 1943 seems not to have disturbed his tranquillity. In 1928 he wrote: ''I have had much faith in Fascism since its first inklings faith that has never ebbed not even in the darkest and most tumultuous moments.'' The regime and the reactionary Strapaese (literally ''supra-country'') movement in turn acclaimed his art as a reaffirmation of eternal values and a rejection of decadent internationalism. And yet once World War II was over Morandi emerged unblemished even winning the painting prize at the 1948 Venice Biennale.The public recognition that followed did spread his renown beyond a small circle of collectors and he even donated some paintings to public museums including ''Still Life 1946'' to the Tate Gallery to this day the only Morandi in the Tate's permanent collection. Yet even as he increased his pace of production he remained ''a contemplative craftsman'' as Matthew Gale collections curator at the Tate writes in a catalog essay.''It takes me weeks to make up my mind which group of bottles will go well with a particular tablecloth'' Morandi once said. ''Then it takes me weeks of thinking about the bottles themselves and yet I often still go wrong with the spaces. Perhaps I work too fast.''When it came to painting he apparently did work quickly as evidenced by his confident brush strokes. But the preparation was time-consuming. He stretched his own canvases he made his own paint he stripped bottles of their labels he filled transparent vases with paint and then emptied them to create an opaque look he painted other vases and he allowed all the objects to accumulate dust. Sometimes he tested his compositions with pencil and paper but more often he simply moved the objects around until he was satisfied. And when he was ready to work he placed his easel just 18 inches from the objects. With landscapes which he invariably viewed through a studio window he found a different solution to the problem of composition. Since he could not move buildings trees or hills he used binoculars to frame the images that he wanted to capture.Some critics have compared Morandi's geometric structures to chess games both ''intellectual and strategic'' as Charles Derwent wrote in The Independent of London. Others like Waldemar Januszcak writing in The Sunday Times of London see an ''intense and silent melancholy'' in his still lifes. Yet for an understanding of this artist's artist perhaps artists should have the last word.''I personally couldn't care less about a bunch of bottles but I'm sure glad Morandi could'' Mr. Close writes in the Tate's catalog. ''The formal invention nuanced adjustments and surprisingly highly charged psychological content thrill me.'' Or as Sarah Jackson an English architect writes: ''In the Morandi paintings some see bottles. I see cities. I explore boundaries. Morandi paints me a city that is mine.''So the answer to the mystery it seems is to look beyond what he is painting.''Jettison 'bottles' from your mind's eye and enjoy a tactile feast of what Morandi does with a single stroke of paint'' Mr. Irwin invites. ''Wonder at how much happens when any one thing touches crowds or intersects with another. Just kick back and enjoy the subtlety of his color and the nuances of his edges and surfaces. This is the incredible economy of means that marks the essence of a master painter of the real.''
 1449,  2010, a, AP Photo/Stephen CherninThe Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Offenbach’s “Contes d’Hoffmann” stirred up heated debate within opera circles for the company’s decision to present a version of the score that fails to take into account recent research into the sources for this compromised score left incomplete at Offenbach’s death. The new production of Bizet’s “Carmen” may also provoke some debate over questions of authenticity.Bizet wrote “Carmen” as an opéra-comique which meant that extended stretches of dialogue were spoken not sung. The term opéra-comique gives the false impression that such operas are comic. But even serious works within this tradition used spoken dialogue as a way of conveying everyday realism.“Carmen” had its premiere in Paris in March 1875 just months before Bizet died at 36. Later that year for a production of “Carmen” in Vienna the composer Ernest Guiraud adapted the spoken dialogue from the libretto (by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy) into recitative which he wrote. It was in this version that “Carmen” gained its immense popularity for the next century.Starting in the 1960s or so it became increasingly common for “Carmen” to be performed as Bizet intended: with spoken dialogue. The Met chose that option for its celebrated 1972 production starring Marilyn Horne and conducted by Leonard Bernstein documented in a Deutsche Grammophon recording.For its new production by the director Richard Eyre the Met is using Guiraud-composed recitatives which was also the choice of Franco Zeffirelli who created the previous production in 1996 a lamentable show. Purists will no doubt object to the Met’s recalcitrance on this matter.Pragmatic reasons are typically cited when a company chooses to use Guiraud’s recitatives. Singers who are not native French speakers are often reluctant to speak the language on stage. Also mezzo-sopranos who revere classic old recordings like the historic 1951 RCA recording starring Risë Stevens with Fritz Reiner conducting often long to sing the role the way they heard it growing up.The Met’s new “Carmen” is a gripping and brilliant production. Still I would have been willing to hear certain singers speak imperfect French for the chance to experience the opera with the realistic urgency that comes from having the dialogue spoken. In this case Elina Garanca the Met’s Latvian Carmen would have been trading many spoken lines with Roberto Alagna the French tenor of Sicilian heritage which would had added pressure on the star.Today at least a majority of opera companies around the world present “Carmen” without the Guiraud recitatives. Let the debate begin.
 3455,  1999, a, So for America Online the reasons to help Comcast fight AT&T are clear. If a combined America Online-Comcast succeeds in acquiring Mediaone America Online will get a guaranteed channel for selling its services to consumers over cable modems. (Even if America Online does not end up participating in a bid for Mediaone it will still get high-speed links to millions of homes through its deals with local Bell phone companies.)The problem for America Online may be that Comcast needs cash. While Comcast's standing offer for Mediaone is all stock AT&T has offered most of an AT&T share plus almost $31 in cash for each share of Mediaone. And in the largest syndicated financing to date managed by Goldman Sachs & Company and Chase Manhattan Bank AT&T has already lined up $30 billion in commitments from lenders to back up its offer.Comcast does not have that kind of financial firepower and America Online may not either. At the end of the last quarter America Online had only $1.8 billion in cash on hand. Even if it could raise a few billion more it would still not be in AT&T's league.One obvious solution for America Online would be to use its stock which has given the company a market value of about $130 billion. But Mediaone's shareholders may have qualms about taking America Online shares which trade at about 400 times estimated earnings. Valuations of that nature may not be sustainable especially if America Online becomes part owner of a cable company since cable companies are generally valued much more conservatively.In addition accepting a bundle of America Online and Comcast shares would not be wholly tax-free for Mediaone's shareholders -- although taking a mix of cash and AT&T stock would not be wholly tax-free either.In some ways Microsoft's position is the opposite of America Online's. Microsoft has almost $22 billion in cash on hand but does not seem to have an obvious strategic reason to go to war against AT&T. Microsoft would like to sell software for high-speed Internet connections but Microsoft and AT&T could find many mutually profitable ways to work together. Microsoft has invested $1 billion in Comcast but that alone would not seem reason enough to make a strategic enemy of AT&T.Mr. Allen may be the most intriguing candidate for Comcast. He has already invested heavily in the cable television industry and he may not care about working with AT&T in the future.
 2056,  2007, a, CHARLESTON S.C. – The most famous face in the city at the moment is that of the composer Philip Glass. You see him in miniature and writ huge on a 38-by-26 foot banner at the Gailliard Auditorium. You see him on posters in store windows and restaurants. You see him walking toward you on the street on the front of a T-shirt and as likely as not the wearer is carrying a program book for the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. with – who else? – Philip Glass on the cover.And he is not even here yet. Beginning on Wednesday Mr. Glass will present the American premiere of his “Book of Longing” which has its world premiere tonight in Toronto. A theater piece it is based on music and images by Leonard Cohen.But the image in question here is the acclaimed “Large Phil Fingerprint/Random” (1979) by Chuck Close. Festival logos in recent years have tended to be more abstract but this one is concrete and insistent. And not everyone is happy about it to judge from comments at a private party last night or even knows who it is.The Charleston Post and Courier reports that it did a quick survey on the street last week and none of the 21 passersby queried knew who it was. One woman thought it looked like Rocky Balboa. And you know there is a little resemblance. It would explain at least the swollen-looking lips.

Under the league's agreement with the players 53 percent of the income from the sale of television rights must go to the players and the new deals will probably push the average salary past $1 million from the current $750000.Under the new agreement TNT will show 50 regular-season games and at least 25 playoff games. The regular-season games are usually shown on Tuesday and Friday evenings.
 4449,  1993, a, If Thursday's concert by Nicolas Collins Joel Ryan Ray Edgar and the Soldier String Quartet at the Kitchen had a collective message it was similar to the one that music has been getting recently from the downtown school of electricity. The traditional artistic process is upended: no more the stepwise progression from materials to technique to beautiful object; now the art is in the materials themselves. How they are organized is anticlimax.Midway through the evening Mr. Ryan unwound wire across the stage plugged it into a terminal and strolled back and forth manipulating its length and rubbing it with a bow. Synthetically generated metaphors for human gesture and man-made sounds boomed and creaked from loudspeakers. The process was repeated a little later through the proximity of hand-held objects to various microphones.This dialogue between man and machine had been introduced a few minutes before in Mr. Collins's "Broken Light" in which fragments of the Italian Baroque are electronically accelerated spit out and responded to by the Soldier's four players. Whether by accident or on purpose there was more a sense of music here than in the two Collins items that came before. "Lightning Strikes Not Once but Twice" and "Sound for Picture" two vignettes on the blind and the deaf seemed more interesting for their narratives than for the bland electronic sound behind them.Mr. Edgar's "Flexsonica II" found the performer hands wired for sound bending and caressing a metal bar. Here an engineer of sorts happily shared empirical discoveries in sound. This Cybertronics series continues on April 16 and 17. Brush up on your applied science. This is a little like a visit to a new-inventions fair.
 3349,  2000, a, At another crowded job fair at the Marriott Hotel in Brooklyn on Wednesday many applicants said they were frustrated that they would not be able to work in districts that were close to home or to their graduate schools. Many districts in Queens and Manhattan have only a few vacancies in troubled schools so most teachers who had their hearts set on working in those boroughs were disappointed. A few teachers at the job fair were in tears.But others were glad to be assigned to a challenging school saying they had gone into the profession to work with children who needed the most help.''I really want to teach disadvantaged kids'' said Waithira Mbuthia-Protano of Mamaroneck N.Y. who accepted a job teaching English at Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx a failing school. ''I want to give I want to sweat I want to give all my energy to help.''To lure certified teachers into the failing schools the Board of Education is offering teachers $3400 in tuition reimbursement over the next four years. The failing schools also have smaller classes and teachers get extra help from curriculum specialists. This summer the board recruited about 330 people with little or no teaching experience to work in the failing schools under an alternative certification program. The board has also held several job fairs for the failing schools since Aug. 1 when Mr. Mills unsatisfied by the city's pace in hiring certified teachers for those schools filed his lawsuit.In an interview yesterday Mr. Mills said certified teachers who did not want to set foot inside the failing schools should reconsider because the students at those schools badly needed qualified teachers.''People are going to have to be guided by their better angels'' he said.He added ''This court action has led to profound change in the way the city places teachers and it's high time.'' The failing schools ''were always last in line and now they are first in line.''But the other parties to the settlement that resulted in the court order were still unhappy with its terms. Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said any teacher who agreed to work in an urban school was taking on a major challenge. ''People who choose urban education are doing God's work'' he said ''and where they choose to teach and how they choose to dedicate themselves is a matter of personal reflection.''
 542,  2016, a, ‘Pip’s Island’If your children have ever wondered what it might be like to step out of one of the gondolas during a theme park ride and interact with all the surrounding animatronic creatures now’s their chance.It’s called “Pip’s Island” a show that is as much a technological extravaganza as it is a theatrical experience — sometimes more so.Developed by Rami Ajami and Rania Ajami a brother-and-sister team and the production’s creative director Walter Krudop the show takes groups of about 50 through a dozen environments in which the children attending help act out the story. The object? To save this magical isle from the villainous Joules Volter who wants to wrest all its energy from the realm’s benevolent guardian Amperes Wattson.

 1257,  2012, a, PhotoLast week Michael Jordan the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats said that he would be open to changing the team’s name to the Hornets should the franchise in New Orleans follow through with plans to change its name to something more befitting that city.“It’s definitely an interest down the road but right now it’s the New Orleans Hornets” Jordan told The Charlotte Observer. “We would definitely entertain the opportunity. That’s as much as we can say right now. We’ve heard the community ask the question and we would listen.”Attempting to invoke nostalgia for a team that dates only to the 1988-89 season probably does not work on the same level as resurrecting the Browns name in Cleveland. But the name would recall memories of the teams that starred Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning and were more entertaining than any Bobcats squad.A name change makes more sense for the New Orleans franchise a city known for many things more positive than the largest of the eusocial wasps. Unfortunately the best name out there may be the Jazz the name of the team that played in New Orleans from 1974 to 1979 before relocating to Salt Lake City.Perhaps a trade can be engineered where the franchise in Charlotte becomes the Hornets the one in New Orleans becomes the Jazz and the one in Utah picks an entirely new name. If the amusingly named Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies could somehow be included in the transaction then basketball team names might make a great deal more geographical sense.The ultimate decision on whether Charlotte could bring back the Hornets name would not be up to the team regardless of what New Orleans decides. The rights would be determined by the N.B.A.Becoming a Dual ThreatAfter consecutive seasons in which he appeared in 31 or fewer games Anderson Varejao the Cavaliers’ center is finally healthy and consistent time on the court seems to be agreeing with him. Through Friday he was leading the N.B.A. with a career-high 15.1 rebounds a game.Always considered a talented rebounder Varejao is starting to prove he is not a one-dimensional player by contributing more on offense. The defensive-minded Varejao has averaged 14.9 points a game besting his previous career high by more than 4 points a game.Despite those improvements his most impressive improvement may be with his free throws. With a career percentage of 60.9 percent from the line coming into the season Varejao is now hitting 80.4 percent of his free throws. Because he plays under the basket and draws a number of fouls being able to capitalize on them is a huge boost in his value.

 3516,  1999, a, Following are excerpts from yesterday's ruling by Judge Denny Chin of Federal District Court allowing Khallid Abdul Muhammad to hold a youth rally in Harlem that he calls the Million Youth March (M.Y.M.):The city's desire to deny Muhammad and M.Y.M. a platform from which to speak is understandable. Many of their statements are bigoted hateful violent and frightening. The right to free speech however applies not only to politically correct statements but also to statements with which we may disagree and indeed abhor.At least as frightening as the rhetoric of Mr. Muhammad is the possibility of a society where freedom of speech is not respected and where the right to speak publicly can be denied on the basis of administrative whim personal dislike or disapproval of anticipated content. . . .On Last Year's RallyI cannot conclude that the violence occurred as a direct result of the inflammatory words uttered by Muhammad (and others) to the crowd. To the contrary one of the videotapes shows that at the time the conflict broke out Muhammad was telling the demonstrators to ''go home to [their] families'' to ''go in the word of love'' to ''go in the word of peace'' and that the crowd has already begun to disperse. . . .I am left with the disquieting impression that the rally was ending and that if the police had simply been patient and given the participants a few minutes to disperse the risk of violence would have been substantially reduced. The scenes of demonstrators throwing barricades and other objects are disturbing but also disturbing is the spectacle of dozens of police officers in riot gear moving in on the stage with a helicopter swooping overhead just moments after the rally was scheduled to end when the rally was indeed about to conclude. . . .

On Monday the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said its decision last June to double the number of best picture nominees to 10 brings with it a change in voting method.The best picture will now be chosen by a preferential voting system rather than the single-choice voting used in other categories. In a statement Tom Sherak recently named president of the academy said preferential voting will help choose the best picture candidate “with the strongest support of a majority of our electorate.”Read more at Media Decoder.

 5246,  1988, a, Tomorrow is the busiest day so far this year for Kentucky Derby prep races with 44 3-year-olds entered for four races in Arkansas Florida Kentucky and New Jersey. All but 8 of those 44 horses have been nominated for the Derby on May 7 and about half of them are being seriously considered for the race.The biggest name in tomorrow's entries is Brian's Time the Florida Derby winner who heads a field of 11 in the $500000 Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park. The Roberto colt's main competition at a mile and an eighth should come from Dynaformer Stalwars and Kingpost. The others in the race all Derby nominees are Delightful Doctor Cannon Dancer Drouilly's Boy Buck Forbes Glory Afar Jim's Orbit and Longview Ashley.The Rebel Handicap at Oaklawn the major prep for that track's Arkansas Derby April 23 drew a field of 10 Derby nominees headed by Notebook who was third in the Florida Derby; Smackover Creek undefeated in two starts and Proper Reality whom Jerry Bailey chose over Brian's Time as a Derby mount. Word Pirate Morgan's Levee Din's Dancer Sea Trek Contempt Gallantmister and Hedevar the Bold complete the field for the mile race.The $250000 Tropical Park Derby at Calder usually run in January but pushed to April this season amid Florida's chaotic racing politics drew a weak field despite its fat purse. The leading 3-year-olds who wintered in Florida have been sent north rather than raced over Calder's unusual synthetic track surface.

 6254,  1973, a, The closed hearing tomor row before Judge Hoffman would mark the first time that the 66‐year‐old judge from the Federal District Court at Norfolk Va. has come here to preside over a confrontation between attorneys for the Vice President and the Justice Department. All nine Federal judges in Baltimore have disqualified themselves from sitting in the case because of past personal or political associations with Mr. Agnew.In a brief hearing with the opposing lawyers in his Norfolk chambers last Friday Judge Hoffman formally received Mr. Agnew's petition to bar further presentation of evidence concerning him to the grand jury here. The judge then set a schedule for prehearing briefs and pleadings on the request to stop the inquiry starting next Friday with the first full hearing set for Oct. 12.Mr. Agnew contends that a sitting Vice President cannot constitutionally be indicted and that the allegations against him cannot be given fair consideration by the grand jury because of news leaks and prejudicial publicity about his case.The sudden unscheduled proceedings before Judge Hoffman here tomorrow kept so tightly secret that it could not be officially confirmed anywhere reportedly was set to receive the request of Mr. Agnew's lawyers for extraordinary court authority to take sworn statements from Government officials believed by them to be the source of leaks to newsmen and perhaps from newsmen themselves.Mr. Agnew's lawyers would make no comment tonight on the nature of the hearing. The United States Attorney's office here whose lawyers are to attend the closed hearing has maintained a policy of refusing to comment on any grand jury matter.Parties in civil lawsuits normally have broad authority to take depositions or sworn statements from witnesses for both sides as part of the pretrial discovery procedure.But no such automatic pro cedure exists in criminal cases and lawyers familiar with the Baltimore investigation said today that they doubted whether Mr. Agnew's lawyers even had the proper legal standing to ask the court to grant such authority.

 6038,  1977, a, WASHINGTON May 1—The United States and China have begun unpublicized negotiations in Washington to settle financial claims between the two countries—a necessary step toward the establishment of normal trade relations.Administration officials disclosed today that the talks had been conducted over the last several weeks by William H. Gleysteen Jr. the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs and Han Hsu the deputy chief of the Chinese Liaison Office here.However despite the declared willingness of both sides to discuss the highly complex problem involving some $80 million in blocked Chinese assets and American claims of $200 million officials said that no breakthrough was near and that it might take a long time to reach an agreement.These are the Carter Administration's first important negotiations with the Chinese to become public and they are in keeping with the President's declared wish to normalize relations.

It was the third attack of its kind in two weeks in a war that will not go away.The conflict diplomats and other analysts said is paralyzing a nation torn by successive conflicts for more than two decades where sovereignty is so eroded so that the Government controls little more than cities and outlying outposts.It is a war one Western diplomat said that seems stalemated the rebels unable to penetrate the cities and Government forces unable to extend their writ into the countryside of this nation lying along the Indian Ocean in southern Africa.Mozambican officials said the latest attack took place close to Manhica 70 miles south of this crumbling whistle stop and only 30 miles north of the capital Maputo.

 434,  2016, a, Cirque du Soleil citing creative differences said it had made a late-in-the-game decision to replace one of the lead actors in its first Broadway show the musical “Paramour.”The company said it was replacing Bradley Dean an actor who most recently appeared on Broadway in “Doctor Zhivago” and “The Last Ship” with Jeremy Kushnier whose Broadway credits include “Footloose” “Jersey Boys” and “Jesus Christ Superstar.”The timing is extraordinarily awkward — Mr. Dean performed the lead role of a movie producer at a press preview on Thursday. On Friday afternoon Scott Zeiger the head of Cirque’s new theatrical division said he had decided to make the change.“Bradley Dean is an extraordinary actor and won the part for all the right reasons but we all felt that the chemistry and dynamic on stage wasn’t what we were hoping it would be” Mr. Zeiger said in a telephone interview. “We were looking for something slightly different from what we were getting and it took watching it from start to finish to see that.”Mr. Kushnier had initially auditioned for the role but didn’t get it. He is now performing Off Broadway in “Shear Madness” but will leave that production join the Cirque production Mr. Zeiger said.He said “Paramour” which combines acrobatics with theatrical storytelling to depict a love triangle between the film producer a writer and an actress would maintain its planned schedule beginning previews on April 16 and opening on May 25 at the Lyric Theater.

 4471,  1993, a, Dressed as bride and groom Hema Sakhrani and Shaleen Wadhwani were mourned yesterday as they lay a few feet from each other in a funeral parlor in Queens. She wore a red sari with gold trim that her uncle had brought from Bombay. He wore a bejeweled turban and a black suit. An orange sash a symbol of the bond between man and woman in Hindu marriage rites joined the two coffins.Their parents held two services for the young couple whose lives had seemed so promising until a man who the police said was obsessed with Miss Sakhrani gunned down Mr. Wadhwani last Wednesday. She was so overcome by grief that she killed herself two days later.Early yesterday morning there was a kind of wedding ceremony. Later several hundred relatives and friends crowded into the same room for the funeral. July Wedding Was PlannedMr. Wadhwani and Miss Sakhrani both 20 were students at New York University who fell in love and planned to marry on July 16. He was about to start medical school on a full scholarship. She excelled in chemistry. Their parents immigrants from India and Pakistan reveled in their children's happiness.
 4554,  1992, a, Polish hams vacuum packed were on sale today on one street corner for 1023 rubles and a downtown store was selling five kinds of smoked fish at prices ranging from 25 rubles a pound to more than 50. There were no lines there nor were there any at the market where cucumbers were being sold at 70 rubles a pound and more. Champagne sold in the commercial stores was going for 120 rubles a bottle and more while a bottle of vodka cost 100 rubles."How can I buy anything at the market when I can't afford what is in the stores?" lamented Mrs. Vrublevskaya's neighbor Lena who with her husband supports their family of four on 700 rubles a month. "How can it be a proper New Year's?" she asked tears in her eyes. 'We Are Slowly Dying'Nobody knows for sure what the prices will be on Thursday but Mrs. Vrublevskaya who depends on word of mouth for her news said people in lines were saying that a loaf of white bread would cost 5 rubles and a loaf of black bread 4 rubles. The current price is about 40 kopecks.The economists hope that a jump in state prices will bring in new shipments of goods and food and restore some balance to a now deeply unstable pricing system. But Mrs. Vrublevskaya who is cheerfully fatalistic sees no reason to hope."We are slowly dying" she said with great calm "just as the Bible said we would. The only expectation is for things to get worse. Either there will be a civil war or we will all burn together as it is written in the Apocalypse."But more immediately Mrs. Vrublevskaya lives in constant dread of falling ill or becoming destitute and losing the children to an orphanage. Abandoned by their mother her daughter the two children are entirely dependent on their grandmother.When she was released from the hospital Mrs. Vrublevskaya was given instructions that in the current situation were almost laughable. The doctors advised her to eat four or five dried peaches a day but with dried peaches selling for 50 rubles a pound she sees no way of following their advice on this and on other matters.

 5453,  1987, a, To the Editor:Now that members of the New York State Senate and Assembly have decided to vote themselves a 30 percent salary increase (news story July 12) I would hope that the State Legislature will become full time.At present members of the State Legislature meet only from January to July. Now that our Senators and Assemblymen will be earning salaries that exceed the full-time salaries of most New Yorkers voters have a right to expect our lawmakers to meet during the last half of the year as well as the first.A State Legislature that would meet regularly during the year would serve the public interest. Much of the work in Albany takes place during the last week of the session - as lawmakers are rushing to go home. Hundreds of bills are approved in the final hours of the session and many legislators have not even had time to scrutinize the bills they are voting on.Voting on bills in the middle of the night is not fair to the voters who have a right to expect their elected officials to vote on bills under proper conditions. Members of a full-time State Legislature would have more time to review the bills they approve or reject. PAUL FEINER Westchester County Legislator Hastings-on-Hudson N.Y. July 12 1987

 5247,  1988, a, Sematech the ambitious industry research consortium designed to restore the ability of the American semiconductor industry to compete with the Japanese is having difficulties finding a chief executive.The consortium has been trying to hire an experienced executive from one of its member companies. But the companies are reluctant to part with key personnel and have made it attractive for the executives to stay. This difficulty is viewed as an indication that the 14 member companies are less inclined to share their manpower for the common good than has been publicly proclaimed.''Sematech will suffer if we don't get someone in soon'' said Robert N. Noyce vice chairman of the Intel Corporation and a member of a three-member committee charged with finding a chief executive. Pentagon AnnoyedThe inability of the industry to find a leader for its much touted research consortium is frustrating the Department of Defense which is underwriting half of the cost and impeding planning for the project Government and industry officials said.

 202,  2018, a, But her submission also reminded me of how much can be learned when journalism becomes more communal and conversational. I would never have known about cakes like the “Maypole” or “Rocking Horse” — nor would I have known they were such cultural touchstones — if not for our attempt to throw open the doors and invite in readers’ stories. Your stories.Looking back over the past year there are so many things I wouldn’t have known if not for readers of this newsletter.The responses to last week’s Australia Letter about history taught me just how common it was to grow up in Australia years ago without being taught Indigenous history — something I hadn’t realized since my own children are receiving more of that education in their public school.If not for all of you I also wouldn’t have grasped the depth of appreciation for Nippers nor the nuance and divisions that shape discussions of race and multiculturalism or gender and power.I would have missed out on many great books restaurants music and movies that many of you suggested; I would have misunderstood the rivalry among Australia’s capital cities or the degree to which people care so much about those that are often overlooked — I’m looking at you Darwin Adelaide and Perth — if not for those who wrote to tell us what they loved about where they lived and why.I could go on but the point is for our first anniversary I’m not going to boast about all the journalism we did that I’m proud of though there’s a fair amount of that.I’m just going to thank you for making the journalism better.Foreign correspondence is nothing if not an attempt to understand and our bureau’s understanding of Australia — even for those who are Australian — has occurred at an accelerated pace thanks to you.
 4591,  1992, a, The words are about women cars and dives; the music rarely uses more than three guitar chords. From those rock-and-roll fundamentals Little Village concocts songs that can swagger and cackle and twang twist a perfect bit of wordplay then reveal unguarded longing and pain.Little Village is the band that made John Hiatt's breakthrough album "Bring the Family" with Ry Cooder on guitars Nick Lowe on bass and Jim Keltner on drums abetting Hiatt's vocals. This time the whole band collaborated on songwriting making the songs slightly less private in tone and winding the rhythms a little tighter.Unlike "Bring the Family" "Little Village" (Reprise 26713; cassette and CD) has the layered sound of a studio production with backup vocal harmonies added percussion and skillfully intertwined guitar parts. But the band still lobs easy syncopations across the beat. Cooder's sliding hanging guitar lines and Keltner's relaxed thump and clatter find the nexus of blues country and gospel while Hiatt's voice bounds through the lyrics like a cartoon hound dog.Little Village finds new ways to connect cars and sex in "She Runs Hot" and in "Solar Sex Panel" an ecologically correct come-on. It also comes up with wry and tender advice for a spurned lover: "Don't you think about her when you're trying to drive."

 2729,  2003, a, The legendary library of Alexandria boasted that it had a copy of virtually every known manuscript in the ancient world. This bibliophile's fantasy in Egypt's largest port city vanished probably in a fire more than a thousand years ago. But the dream of collecting every one of the world's books has been revived in a new arena: online.The directors of the new Alexandria Library which christened a steel and glass structure with 250000 books in October have joined forces with an American artist and software engineers in an ambitious effort to make virtually all of the world's books available at a mouse click. Much as the ancient library nurtured Archimedes and Euclid the new Web venture also hopes to connect scholars and students around the world.Of course many libraries already provide access to hundreds or even thousands of electronic books. But the ambitions of the Alexandria Library appear to surpass those of its rivals. Its directors hope to link the world's other major digital archives and to make the books more accessible than ever with new software.To its supporters the project called the Alexandria Library Scholars Collective could ultimately revolutionize learning in the developing countries where libraries are often nonexistent and access to materials is hard to come by. Cheick Diarra a former NASA engineer and the director of the African Virtual University said he plans to begin using the Alexandria software this year at the university's 34 campuses in 17 African countries.

''He had a grind-it-out approach. He put a heavy emphasis onbeing able to block even for the halfbacks.''Landau recalls Perles as a ''streets of Detroit guy.''''That's where he was from and it shaped the way he acted'' he said. ''He was tough but he was very loyal. If he thought you were with him he stuck by you. But if he thought you weren't you were his enemy for life.''

 6136,  1977, a, “The Water Engine” next month and the official opening doesn't come until February.Meanwhile audiences have been coming at $5 apiece plus whatever they spend on eating and drinking—rthe prices are modest and the food is simple and good—and what they have been seeing is uneven but generally worthwhile.Dr. Buber's Hasidic tales can be brief and as unsubstantial as butterfly wings but when the wings have passed by a small bomb has been dropped and precisely detonated. The tales are funny dreamy and purposeful; they circle wander off vaguely and end up dead‐center on their target.The Sills company—they were the creators of Story Theater—have a fine comic gravity and a dignified madness that is most appropriate. The trouble is that many of the tales are too” elusive for flesh-and-blood enactment.The performance is most successful when several characters are required when some real action must be played out. There is a particularly fine episode when Eugene Troobnick bleary and unkempt plays a water‐carrier who is dragged off to explain why his seder has been so much more incandescent than the rabbi's. “I am not a well water‐carrier” he protests and explains to the rabbi that he has done his eight days of drinking in advance.Severn Darden's rabbi is the best thing in the evening. Mr. Darden stout white‐bearded looks like a Santa Claus who has kept every one of his original teeth. He floats around tentatively an incipient shrug possessing his shoulders as he spins out his improbable answers to points of morals and doctrine. He is a perpetual “perhaps” subject to fits of joy.

 1290,  2011, a, Related Article A Breast-Feeding Plan Mixes Reactions This article prompted e-mails to the Public Editor regarding the use of anonymous blog quotes.Kate Zernike in her report on Michelle Obama’s effort to promote breast-feeding went to the blogs to canvas political comment. There she found a surprising number of people crossing political boundaries to express support or opposition.But reader Michael Denham of Boston questioned the quality of the sourcing of the story as did other readers who contacted the public editor’s office. Mr. Denham noted a quote in the story that was attributed only as “one person on a blog” – and an anonymous one at that.“One person on a blog does not a citation make” he wrote in an email. “Upon reading it I felt uneasy with the utter lack of sourcing.”The story which was published online Feb. 17 demonstrates a problem inherent in using blogs for quote fodder. If you were to identify a hierarchy of sources by quality an anonymous blogger would have to occupy the bottom rung or near it.The Times’s policy on anonymous sourcing describes the use of anonymous sources as a “last resort to obtain information that we believe to be newsworthy and reliable.” The policy goes on to say that the identity of every anonymous source should be known by at least one editor. Unfortunately it is all but impossible to know the identity of an anonymous blogger.That said I can see some merit in reporting on how a particular political controversy is playing out in the blogosphere so long as that is clearly described as the basis of the story.In this case the story went some distance toward doing this – in the third paragraph the story said “On blogs and in interviews some liberal Democrats found themselves agreeing with Representative Bachmann a Tea Party celebrity from Minnesota when she criticized the first lady for a campaign to promote breast-feeding. Some conservatives meanwhile stood up for Mrs. Obama for promoting what they said was a healthier choice.”Ms. Zernike told me her reporting included interviews as well as the blog material and that interviewees were reluctant to be quoted. The blog material supported what she was hearing in her interviews she said.“I wouldn’t have taken only blog postings but given that they backed up what I was hearing elsewhere – and that this was generating so much comment online – they seemed to be relevant” she said.Rick Berke the national editor said “Kate’s piece tried to capture the huge outpouring on different sides on the blogs.”But she had a difficult time getting people on the record he said. “I wished we had explained this outpouring and how people did not want to speak for quotation. We should have also better identified the specific blog posts.

General Family Shelter: the city’s largest homeless facility which houses hundreds of families. The mayor and City Council want to close the complex and replace it with more intimate shelters spread out across Washington. The city spends around $80000 every night on hotel rooms for homeless families.“People underestimate the degree to which housing is out of reach for certain people” said Laura Zeilinger the director of the Department of Human Services in Washington. She said her department had a commitment to make sure that families were safe and able to survive custody battles and violent homes and that they were not “living in gas stations or McDonald’s or laundromats while we try to fix the system.”In such a desirable real estate market landlords are circumspect taking government subsidies for affordable housing before screening out potential tenants for qualities associated with homelessness Ms. Zeilinger said.Often the last line of defense for those facing this kind of discrimination is the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless where for 25 years Patty Mullahy Fugere has supervised a staff of lawyers who offer legal counsel on shelter and emergency resources to the homeless.“There’s a bit of a double standard with the city that we’ve seen: We improve our schools our roads. We put in bike lanes and dock parks and spent a lot of public money trying to attract outsiders” she said. “It’s low-income residents who are drawn into the District who want to relocate here because there’s a stronger safety net to help them get back on their feet. Then for whatever reason those folks seem to be demonized.”“There’s enough of the renaissance for everyone” Ms. Mullahy Fugere said.Since her election in 2014 Mayor Muriel Bowser has made homelessness a higher priority than her more stringent predecessor did extending the availability of shelters beyond the cold-weather months when there is a threat of hypothermia. The survey pointed out that the Bowser administration had done especially well sheltering homeless children and veterans. In 2016 the city had the lowest percentage of unsheltered homeless among the study’s cities.
 4410,  1993, a, The autobiographical strain continues in the tentlike "Singer House." Its thin frame structure is made of yardsticks hung with pairs of scissors its sides of sewing patterns; ribbons and dress trimmings stream from its roof. At its center raised on a big heart-shaped pincushion of red velvet sits a 1940's Singer sewing machine encrusted with pearls. A wall text says that the work is dedicated to Mr. Martorell's mother who supported her family as a seamstress and by extension to all the women who have earned their livelihood through sewing in the Caribbean or in Manhattan sweatshops like those in SoHo that have only recently been displaced by art galleries.The immigrant experience itself is one of the show's recurring motifs. Just as most of the installations in "A House for Us All" were created in Puerto Rico and are very likely to return there at the end of this exhibition's run one of the defining features of the "Nuyorican" experience is the frequent shuttling from the island to the mainland and back. Mr. Martorell's work suggests that this commute has produced not only a vital hybrid culture but also an odd sense of psychological suspension between the Caribbean home and the northern city that holds the possibility of economic survival.Interestingly this state of perpetual transience is most directly addressed by the show's only site-specific work commissioned by El Museo del Barrio. Titled "House in Mid-Air" it simulates the tunnel-like interior of a small commercial shuttle plane although here the seats are a collection of fabulously embroidered lawn chairs and rockers the windows are mirrors framed with pom-pon tassels the walls are covered with the text of a provocative story by the Puerto Rican writer Luis Rafael Sanchez and a small plastic radio plays salsa throughout the trip. "House in Mid-Air" is a physically dense piece although like everything else here it has a sense of improvisational deftness as if it had been created in a single work-intensive session.Other pieces in the show are more spare even severe. Some of them are obviously political in meaning. The decorative window grilles that form "The Green House" for example are used as security devices in Puerto Rican homes but here they are ornamented with rows of pennies. And at least one installation is literally poetic. The paper "Rilke's House" takes the form of a huge air-mail envelope with woodcut portraits of the German writer Rainer Maria Rilke stamped on the outside and passages from his "Letters to a Young Poet" written in flowing script on the interior. "Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance" reads one of its lines.In fact it is exactly a sense of having been conceived and executed out of love and affirmation that makes this show so moving and puts it in an odd position in the present art climate. Although museums and academic art departments are paying lip service to exploring the contemporary art of all world cultures there appears to be a firm institutional line drawn between the often didactic ironic theory-driven work that has dominated New York in the last decade and the emotionally open intensely metaphorical art represented by "A House for Us All."

Abrams $24.95) is to go on sale at cosmetics counters later this month as well as in bookstores. An exhibition of the photographs will open on Sept. 14 at the Holly Solomon Gallery in SoHo. The gallery will also sell the pictures.The photographs are the work of EVELYN H. LAUDER so there's no need to explain the cosmetics connection or the whys and wherefores. Mrs. Lauder the senior corporate vice president of Estee Lauder is donating her royalties to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and many department stores are following suit with from half to all of their profits.An originator of the pink-ribbon campaign to increase awareness of breast cancer Mrs. Lauder has already raised $18 million for a breast cancer center for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and for research into the disease.Not so incidentally Mrs. Lauder said the family company will soon introduce a new cosmetics color -- you guessed it -- "Pink Ribbon."

 2032,  2007, a, Carolyn Brown’s rich account of 20 years of dancing with Merce Cunningham and John Cage “Chance and Circumstance” provides an insider’s portrait of two pioneering modernists who ventured into uncharted territory in the realm of dance and music. Brown vividly evokes the thrills and struggles inherent to true liberation and describes the courage requisite to artistic inventiveness. She is a rare memoirist who focuses on her mentors’ physical and spiritual leaps rather than on herself; her guileless revelations illuminate what went right and wrong in Cunningham and Cage’s personal dealings as well as in their fight for survival.Brown first saw Cunningham dance when she took a master class with him in 1951:“He was slender and tall with a long spine long neck and sloping shoulders; a bit pigeonbreasted. There was a lightness of the upper body which contrasted with the solid legs so beautifully shaped and the heavy massive feet. … I remember Merce most clearly demonstrating a fall that began with him rising onto three-quarter point in parallel position swiftly arching back like a bow as he raised his left arm overhead and sinking quietly to the floor on his left hand curving his body over his knees rising on his knees to fall flat out like a priest at the foot of the cross rolling over quickly and arriving on his feet again in parallel position — all done with such speed and elegance suppressed passion and catlike stealth that my imitative dancer’s mind was caught short. I could not repeat it. I could only marvel at what I hadn’t really seen. His dancing was airborne. … Merce Cunningham had an appetite for dancing that seemed to me then as it does today to be his sole reason for living. … He was a strange disturbing mixture of Greek god panther and madman.”Only another dancer could capture Cunningham’s extraordinary physical prowess dexterity and deliberate emotional abandon. And only someone with Brown’s intrinsic personal modesty and generous spirit could be so trenchant about the man who has enchanted but plagued her from then until now.The book follows Cunningham’s company from its formative years in squalid conditions to glamorous world tours. Unwilling to settle for clichés Brown questions the notion that Cunningham got his ideas for dance movements by watching people on the street from a high window. She maintains that Cunningham’s work has more meaning and depends less on chance than he often admitted. Similarly she does not hesitate to claim that George Balanchine resorted to “daisy-chain contortionist acrobatics” and “girlie-show kitsch” when choreographing to modern composers like Schoenberg and Ives teetering on “the Mickey Mouse-‘Fantasia’ aesthetic” in what the public perceives as undisputed masterworks. Right or wrong Brown writes with the courage and conviction of a true devotee.PhotoShe rounds out the portraits of her characters by depicting them as the children of their parents. John Cage’s taste for the unconventional was in his genes. The year Cage was born 1912 his father invented a submarine run by a gasoline engine (worthless to the government since enemy ships could detect its location from the bubbles produced); John Milton Cage Sr. also devised an alcohol-based panacea for all woes and patented a wall-size television projection system. However creative Cage Sr. was though when his son’s “Suite by Chance” was first performed in the 1950s he and Carolyn Brown’s father said “they both made better music in the ‘water closet.’” Cage’s and Brown’s mothers were offended by electronic blasts that they felt deliberately imitated human wind during a plié; in fact Brown says “the flatulent sound … occurred completely by chance and took Merce (and the composer!) by surprise.” Brown’s parents wept after seeing the large Robert Rauschenberg painting for which her husband had paid $26 believing their son-in-law might be mentally ill. Cunningham’s mother Mayne appears when the company spends a Thanksgiving holiday in the choreographer’s hometown Centralia Wash. Mayne brings out Wilhelmina a floppy lifesize “girl-doll” whose shoes are still attached to the larger shoes that young Merce wore when doing a ballroom act with her.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBrown is on surer ground discussing dance — her métier — than painting where she is an outsider attracted to apparent novelty and too readily prizes theory over craft. She knowingly positions Cunningham in relation to Martha Graham and Antony Tudor but when she writes about Jasper Johns and Rauschenberg she lacks equivalent perspective neglecting the pivotal role of Kurt Schwitters and Hans Arp and other predecessors of these American artists who have enjoyed such disproportionate celebrity and absurdly high market values. Brown would have done better to exercise the independence with which she evaluates the big names of dance.
 5625,  1986, a, Warnings by the Reagan Administration that it would oppose further World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank loans if Chile's leaders did not improve their human rights record appear to have shaken the ruling junta a bit. According to the Center for International Policy Chile asked that final consideration of some $250 million in multilateral development bank loans be postponed until November.They had originally been scheduled for consideration in September or October.Recently Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams warned that if Chile did not move toward a democracy the Administration would oppose any of the new loans. Chile's President Gen. Augusto Pinochet in turn threatened to stop payment on all of Chile's $20 billion in foreign debt the highest per capita in South America.But that could just be necessary grandstanding. Future financing that might total $1.5 billion from private banks appears to hinge on Chile's good standing with the World Bank and the development bank. As such although the loan was in the final stages of approval ''Chile claimed that it needed additional time to get its economic plans in order before presenting the loan to the World Bank executive board'' the international policy center said.

 4344,  1994, a, To the Editor:Re "The Making of a Tragedy" by Thomas Fleming (Op-Ed July 19): The Allies had many good reasons for not paying much attention to the German military's tardy resistance to Hitler but the underlying reason showed that the lessons of history can sometimes be properly applied.In 1918 the German generals were allowed to deal for peace the Kaiser was put on a train to the Netherlands in his pajamas and the Fatherland was left physically untouched. The resulting "stab in the back" myth and the glorification of the invincible German "front soldier" laid the foundations of World War II.The Allies were determined not to create a similar situation in 1944 insisting instead on total unconditional surrender. The message was to be unmistakable: You Germans are not invincible and have no one to blame for your destruction but your own leaders. Mr. Fleming writes that "unconditional surrender was a propaganda windfall for the Nazis."On the contrary this strategy won the peace. The West Germans became a nation of pacifists and did not look back fondly to those "fighting" days in occupied Poland. What they saw was simply too horrible. The Holocaust? Until 30 years after the war the murder of the Jews was hardly an issue in Germany.
 3202,  2001, a, To the Editor:Although I support the military operation in Afghanistan the Oct. 29 photograph of four Afghan children being prepared for burial after an American airstrike is as haunting as some of the images from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against our country. The accompanying news article about more civilian deaths because of the airstrikes is equally disturbing.A dearth of obvious targets seems to be forcing the United States military to strike at marginal targets leading to the death of innocent civilians. No matter how much good will the United States' military operation enjoys if major military actions can't be justified the American people and their supporters around the world will see these actions as an illegitimate and unnecessary use of force.The government has prepared us for and we will accept a long and difficult war against terrorism. Now the United States government and the military should take their time and do it right.SALLY MACALarchmont N.Y. Oct. 29 2001

 2027,  2007, a, Thank you for your column on traveling with pets (March 4). But please expose the pet travel racket within Europe. We are seeking quotes for taking our Labrador from London to Nice in July or August. British Airways directs us to World Cargo (www.baworldcargo.com) which cites an oligopoly of four accredited shippers.The “handling fee” for pickup and drop-off of the dog works out to £650 with V.A.T. or $1262 at $1.98 to £1 — more than £16 or $31 per kilogram (including crate) — about twice the price of a round-trip business-class ticket. Last year we paid only about £400 ($777) with British Midland which took the dog as “excess baggage.” Are there other options?Claus Moehlmann LondonIt is costly to transport pets if you want them to be safe and comfortable but there is no “racket” that I can see. As of October 2006 British Airways no longer allows passengers to check in their pets as excess baggage but requires them to be shipped by a freight forwarding agent who has an account with British Airways and books the space preferably a recognized pet travel agent at cargo rates.According to Ross Gays European director of WorldCare Pet Transport (www.worldcarepet.com) in London: “Other airlines may start to require pets to travel only through cargo systems via a pet travel agent not checked in as before by the accompanying owner as excess baggage.”But “cargo” costs a lot more than “excess baggage” because you are paying a freight forwarding agent who then has to pay the airline for the transportation. Mr. Gays estimates that transporting your dog as “excess baggage” would have cost £150 compared with the £650 you were quoted. “But your reader is getting a reasonable deal” Mr. Gays said. “We would have quoted more for the service that we provide.”You are not required to use one of the four pet travel agents suggested by British Airways: Airpets.com; Par Air (www.parair.co.uk); Whitelea Skydogs (www.skydogs.co.uk); and Pinehawk Livestock Shippers (44-1223-290249). You can use any accredited agent preferably a member of the Independent Pet and Animal Transportation Association (www.ipata.com). Who you choose may depend on price level of service and where you going.Air France allows pets to be checked in as excess baggage. But to fly nonstop from London to Nice you are limited to British Airways and easyJet which does not transport pets. (To fly Air France you must change planes in Paris.) — ROGER COLLIS

 4588,  1992, a, On a mild day in March a stroller in Vienna's Volksgarten (People's Garden) notices that the ravens are suddenly missing from their posts in the trees. Their departure to Russia anticipates the end of the gloomy Danubian winter. Because of the ravens some Viennese birdwatchers prefer to visit this small park in winter but given its central location the Volksgarten is truly a park for all hours and seasons.Built in the 1820's on the spot where Napoleon's retreating army removed a fortification from the city's glacis the Volksgarten is refined as parks go holding nature at a distance. The grass is off-limits but visitors can walk along the maze of paths admiring the rose garden examining the neoclassical Temple of Theseus and pausing at the monument to the beloved Empress Elisabeth who was assassinated in 1898 in Geneva. In one corner is a small octagon-shaped pavilion where coffee and cake are served outside once the weather is predictably nice.Opening off the Volksgarten and spatially part of it is the Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square) from which one can look onto the greatest panorama in all Vienna: the Burgtheater a corner of the neo-Renaissance University the neo-Gothic steeple of the Rathaus (City Hall) the racing chariots atop the Parliament and straight ahead the domes of the Fine Arts and Natural History museums. On the Heldenplatz you can lie in the large tracts of grass among the lilac bushes and wonder at how much sky is visible from the center of a city.
 2046,  2007, a, I always knew I was special. And now research from San Diego State University proves that I am just as unique as everybody else: I and my collegiate peers are 30 percent more narcissistic than the fluffy-haired and spandex-clad college students of 1982.I’m not sure how something like this is measured but apparently our inflated self-confidence follows us into the workplace. In an article entitled “The Most-Praised Generation Goes to Work” [$] Jeffrey Zaslow of The Wall Street Journal explores this “culture of praise” noting an increase in the need for approval among workers in their 20s and the hiring of corporate “celebration assistants” who help teach managers to compliment young employees with encouraging e-mail prizes and “public displays of appreciation.”Now I enjoy a compliment on a job well done; no one likes to go unnoticed. But I don’t know that I require more praise than older people in order to perform the same level of work.It may be true that our parents tended to over- rather than under-praise us. But I suspect that it is simply feedback rather than praise that my age group craves. I can’t speak for more than a handful of my friends and myself but I know that I feel anxious when I have no inkling of how I’m doing. Growing up with the Internet embedded in my daily life I’m used to hearing from people constantly. When I hear nothing my hyper-connected self assumes that I’m performing at a mediocre level if not doing something wrong.Online everything is instantaneously judged. Anyone who has access to a computer has a voice and everyone’s opinion can be recorded. Being able to post amateur photographs or writing and receive comments from anonymous readers in Japan and Kansas contributes to an inflated ego.Yet a touch of cynicism taints the complimentary experience. In a world where people can become famous by videotaping themselves stuffing a record number of marshmallows into their mouths it’s hard to take praise seriously. Public attention and affection seems to be shifting away from the accomplished and toward the abnormal.The striking downside to an institutionalized celebration assistant is that workers may no longer feel unique or singled out for their work. If it’s someone’s job to tell you that you’re fabulous and if your cubicle-mates are also regularly showered with confetti the praise rings hollow. Specific content-driven feedback is what we need not praise for simply showing up to work or performing a basic job requirement.Do employers truly consider us thinner-skinned than previous generations? I think we’re merely more high-strung. With colleges graduating more and better-educated students than in years past the competition for even entry-level positions can be fierce. It’s become increasingly difficult to turn down any opportunities that fall in front of us. So we’re taking on responsibilities earlier in our lives than our elders did.A good friend who had an internship the summer leading up to his senior year received a job offer starting in the fall when he was still busy completing his last semester of schoolwork. As he thumbed through his Blackberry after – and frequently during – class his furrowed brow and frazzled demeanor belied his image as a calm professional. In fact he felt trapped by his opportunity; he couldn’t turn it down regardless of the toll it took on his personal life.The weight of responsibilities like these adds up as each one is precariously balanced. While we’re building our platforms to become the Professional American 2.0 taking on the jobs that society offers maybe we need reassuring feedback in order to cope.Is a little bit of ego-stroking too much to ask?
 1783,  2009, a, MIXA/Getty ImagesStress fractures are one of the more pernicious injuries in sports afflicting the experienced and the aspiring with no regard for competitive timing. Last year Tiger Woods managed to win the U.S. Open despite suffering from stress fractures in his left leg (as well as other leg and knee injuries) while the great British marathoner Paula Radcliffe struggled through the Beijing Olympics Marathon on a leg barely recovered from a stress fracture one of several she’s suffered. The International Association of Athletics Federations the world governing body for track and field recently described stress fractures with a kind of grim resignation as “the curse of athletes.”But studies published in this month’s issue of the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise offer hope that at least for runners simple alterations in their stride or in the strength of their legs might reduce their risk for the most common type of stress fracture.In one of the studies undertaken at the University of Minnesota researchers recruited 39 competitive women runners ages 18 to 35 and started measuring them. In particular the scientists wanted to examine the size and shape of their shinbones or tibias. About half of all stress fractures occur in the tibia studies show. When you run or jump that bone is pulled and bent. Sometimes microscopic fissures form. In most cases these tiny cracks heal quickly. But sometimes continued activity overwhelms the bone’s capacity to recover. The cracks grow and combine into a fracture.The Minnesota researchers wanted to see whether the shinbones of the runners with a history of stress fractures were weaker than those without. Earlier studies suggested that this would be the case. But few studies have examined the size of the runners’ calf muscles. Bones tend to adapt to the muscles around them; puny muscles can mean puny bones. The Minnesota scientists using a new machine that examines bone in three dimensions and measuring the runners’ leg muscles found that surprisingly the injured runners’ bones were as strong in relation to their muscle size as the bones in the uninjured runners. But the injured runners had significantly smaller calf muscles and therefore also slighter bones. The primary difference the researchers concluded between the women who suffered stress fractures and those who hadn’t was the size (and presumably strength) of their calf muscles.This finding should be encouraging to anyone who has had a tibial stress fracture or would prefer not to. “It does seem as if strengthening the calf muscles may be a very easy way” to reduce fracture risk says Moira Petit an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Minnesota and an author of the study. In addition she said “our data suggest that you don’t have to strengthen the muscle by much.” A small increase of bulk achievable by for instance rising up on to your toes and sinking back to the floor 10 or 12 times every day might be enough. Adding even a small amount of calf muscle “serves two purposes” Ms. Petit says. First “the strength of the bone will usually increase” in response to the added muscle. And as a bonus the new muscle “can absorb more” of the forces generated when you run. So even as the tibia strengthens in response to the new muscle it also is subjected to less shock. “Really there’s no downside to this” Ms. Petit says.Her results though may apply primarily to women; she’s studying male runners but so far she says isn’t seeing the same relationship between their calf-muscle size and bone strength. The other study in the current Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise however did focus on men and their stress fractures although in this case the lead researcher suggests that the findings would be true in women as well. In the work from Iowa State University in Ames computer modeling was used to predict what would happen to stress fracture risk if runners changed their strides. The researchers attached reflective markers to the bodies of 10 former or current collegiate-level cross-country runners and had them run repeatedly down a runway nearly 30 meters long making sure to step onto a force plate that measured how hard they were striking the ground. During successive runs the men were asked to shorten their natural strides while maintaining their pace. The scientists entered the data into computer programs that calculated just how much force was being applied to the shinbone under different striding conditions. The researchers determined that reducing stride length by about 10 percent seemed to reduce the stress on the tibia enough to lower the risk of a stress fracture.Why though should shortening your stride affect your tibia at all? “Think of it this way” says Brent Edwards lead author of the study and now a post-doctoral research fellow in the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition at the University of Illinois in Chicago. “If you spend less time in the flight phase of running” — meaning in the air — “you’ll hit the ground with less force.” On the other hand you’ll hit the ground more often. But in Mr. Edwards’s models the reduction in pounding from an abbreviated stride outweighed the shock from a few additional strides per mile.Even for those of us without a biomechanical expert in the house gauging a 10 percent reduction in stride is not difficult Mr. Edwards says. “Ten percent is about as much as you can shorten your stride without it beginning to feel quite uncomfortable” he says. And absolute precision isn’t necessary. “Seven or eight or nine percent is fine” he says.Neither Ms. Petit nor Mr. Edwards suggests of course that any single prevention approach will end all tibial stress fractures. “There are so many elements involved” Ms. Petit says. Training hormones genetics diet and shoe choice probably all play a role. “But if there’s something easy and benign that you can do to lessen the risk” she asks “why not?”
 6180,  1976, a, ROME April 1— The decision taken by the New Jersey Supreme Court in the controversial case of Karen Anne Quinlan was‐ criticized today by a professor in an interview on the Vatican radio station. The subject matter of the station's programs cosely reflect Vatican policy.The court declared yesterday that the mechanical equipment that has been keeping Miss Quinlan alive could be turned off at the discretion of her father if doctors saw no hope for her recovery. The ruling also guaranteed that physicians attending the young woman would be legally protected from being held liable should they grant the parents’ request.Speaking on the Vatican station Sergio Cotta a professor of the philosophy of law at Rome University. said that the court's decision presented “very dangerous aspects.” The ruling he said reflected “an exasperation of the tendency in American courts to uphold the right to privacy as a right to be able to decide anything.”“From this point of view each would become master of his own life” Professor Cotta added. “One could ‐wish or not wish one's own death whenever one wanted.”
 3749,  1997, a, FOR a week you have eyed that five-pound box of cheap cookies that a business associate sent over. You have wondered what to do with the scraps of Christmas ham.You are not alone. Professional caterers have dealt with the leftovers problem year in and year out. They have to. You may worry about how leftovers will affect your waistline. They worry about how waste affects their bottom line.So what does happen to perfectly edible food that caterers prepare but the guests don't eat? And what about the end pieces from many sides of smoked salmon or the stems from 100 pounds of mushrooms?If a client does not want to keep the leftover food the caterer is responsible for disposing of it. A lot of course goes to shelters. Some must be thrown away for safety reasons. But some can be recycled. So can food that never leaves the catering establishment: the unused parts of ham and mushrooms broccoli and salmon.
 4750,  1991, a, To the Editor:Apropos the recurring confusion generated by the Lincoln's Birthday and Washington's Birthday holidays: Let's add to it. On George Washington's birth certificate it says that he was born on Feb. 11 1731. In the textbooks it says that he was born Feb. 22 1732. Which side is correct? Both as usual.When Julius Caesar developed his calendar his solar calculations were off by 11 minutes and 14 seconds a year. It added up over time. When Pope Gregory XIII developed his calendar in 1582 the disparity had reached 10 days. Gregory decreed that Oct. 4 1582 should be called Oct. 15.England and its colonies finally adopted the Gregorian calendar on Sept. 2 1752 decreeing the next day should be Sept. 14 thus bridging the 11-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Thus too George Washington's birth date was transposed from Feb. 11 1731 (called Old Style) to Feb. 22 1732 (New Style). The British act also fixed the start of the new year at Jan. 1.Since the calendar was changed in September moving January and February to the beginning of the year Washington did not have a birthday in 1731. He skipped a year and thus became 11 days older and one year younger. JOHN M. CULKIN New York Feb. 22 1991

 4810,  1991, a, Liberia's two largest political factions moved today to set aside their differences and put an end to a bitter rivalry that has cost tens of thousands of lives.An accord between the National Patriotic Front and rival Interim Government of Liberia a breakthrough after months of stalemate was reached after a 90-minute meeting here between Charles Taylor the leader of the front and Amos Sawyer the interim President. Five West African heads of government also attended the meeting.Although details of the agreement were not disclosed both Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sawyer described the meeting at the country estate of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny as historic.But officials close to the talks cautioned that several major obstacles remain in the negotiations. There was virtually no discussion today of a date for free elections. The two sides also disagree on whether their troops should be integrated into a single army before or after elections are held.

 384,  2016, a, What We’re ReadingGet recommendations from New York Times reporters and editors highlighting great stories from around the web. What We’re Reading emails are sent twice a week.The AtlanticMany of us who grew up savoring the subversive humor and psychological sophistication of the early “Peanuts” comics have had to confront the question: When did it go bad? When did it lose its edge and become a maudlin “Happiness is a warm puppy” Hallmark sentiment? In this deep and thoughtful piece Sarah Boxer examines the theory that the emergence of Snoopy — the narcissistic upright-walking beagle — as the strip’s central character is to blame. The story offers a glimpse inside Charles Schulz’s complicated relationship with his characters and with his own success. — Carolyn RyanNew York MagazineSometimes you read an article and think sarcastically “Wow tough assignment.” You might have that reaction to this terrifically entertaining Maureen O’Connor piece about partying with millionaires in Gstaad. (The occasion is the annual gathering of A Small World an international members-only club.) Or you might just be glad you stayed home after reading retch-inducing details like this one: “Jimmy Choo has manufactured golden sleds which everyone rides down the mountain.” — Dan SaltzsteinVoxWhat accounts for Donald Trump’s political popularity? The answer Vox suggests is in the writings of the anthropologist and philosopher Dr. Ernest Becker who wrote that supporting charismatic figures is an existential strategy to ward off terror. Terror of what? Read on. — Jack BeggPriceonomics“What needs to be invented?” a musician-engineer named Andy Hildebrand asked his lunch companions in 1995. “Why don’t you make a box that will let me sing in tune?”one responded. That was a holy grail for inventors and Mr. Hildebrand was the perfect person to take up the quest. Here is the back story behind Auto-Tune and the simple economics of why — love it or hate it — music studios had no choice but to adopt it. “Sometimes I’ll tell people ‘I just built a car I didn’t drive it down the wrong side of the freeway’ ” the story quotes him as saying. “But haters will hate.” — Dan BlumbergPoliticoWe all get what we want from “Star Wars” — technological thrills nostalgia participation in the national conversation — but the author finds our modern political discourse too. In this essay he writes “In Star Wars I see now art and analysis merge in a galaxy-sized reminder that politics — that indefinite combination of power and money family drama and national fate our better angels and our inner demons — is the most irresistible of human activities to ponder.” — Jennifer Steinhauer

 1679,  2009, a, As The New York Times’s Zachery Kouwe wrote on Friday Chrysler‘s bankruptcy is anything but ordinary. With the government serving as a major lender to the automaker and a prime mover in its negotiations with other creditors this case is politically charged from the beginning.A rift with Wall Street has already emerged as a group of financial firms holding Chrysler’s secured debt has balked at the government’s debt restructuring proposal calling it unfair and counter to the principles of bankruptcy law.As the case was just getting under way David Friedman the head of the bankruptcy group at the law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman sent DealBook some of his thoughts on the political aspects of this Chapter 11 case.The Obama administration has talked about a quick and “surgical” bankruptcy bur Mr. Friedman (who isn’t involved in the case) suggests that novel issues could complicate Chrysler’s reorganization — especially as relates to the Chrysler holdouts whose role as secured lenders would ordinarily put them first on the list to be paid back.Those firms pointed out Thursday that they have been represented in their talks with the Treasury Departmentby major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup which have taken money under the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program. For the holdouts that raised questions about how free the banks were to push back at the Treasury Department’s terms.Some of these holdout creditors acquired their Chrysler debt on the secondary market for much less than full value however. Critics of the holdouts say this raises questions about whether these creditors are simply speculators looking for a quick profit.As the many players in Chrysler’s Chapter 11 went to court in New York on Friday for the first-day hearing we thought Mr. Friedman’s comments made for interesting reading.Mr. Friedman wrote:We have issues here that have never really been implicated before. The holdouts are going to say that this is a noneconomic deal. They’ll take the position that if Chrysler were to liquidate they’d get a premium to what they’ve been offered. That in itself is a legitimate defense of the holdouts against the plan. The valuation fight over what creditors will get in liquidation is not unusual and happens all of the time. What’s unusual is the notion of banks being socialized. If you’re a minority creditor you’d be saying that you’re being outvoted not on the merits but because a good number of the banks are under effective — though not absolute — control of the government. There are going to be some minority creditors who will take the position that the banks’ votes should not be counted as traditional creditors are considered in most bankruptcies. Nobody has ever touched this issue before. If the holdouts are being outvoted by people who are voting to achieve a social policy that is being forced upon them by the government they might argue that they shouldn’t be bound by that outcome.He went on to suggest that the Chrysler case could have long-term effects on creditors’ rights and the value of contracts:

Two budding American ballet dancers — Julian MacKay and Joy Womack — have done just that.As I write in The Times Julian and Joy are among only a small group of Americans who have ever trained at the prestigious and competitive Bolshoi academy in Moscow.VideoThe experience has been thrilling but daunting. When they arrived last fall their technique was deemed unworthy their bodies in need of extensive reshaping. And they were told to lose weight though it would have been hard to see why.

 7413,  1964, a, MOSCOW Feb. 29—The Soviet Government newspaper said tonight that political jokes current in the Soviet Union were stimulating “unhealthy interest” in the political opponents of Premier Khrushchev who were ousted from the ruling group in 1957.A reader's letter in the newspaper Izvestia urged a campaign against such “twaddle.” The reader broadened his complaint to take in all gibes that denigrated Soviet life.He specified that the campaign he had in mind should stop short of the methods used by Stalin to suppress dissent.The letter covering half a page in the six‐page edition of Izvestia was the latest indication of discontent sections of the populace. The discontent appears to be related to the economic setback suffered last year as a result of the failure of the wheat crop.

 5820,  1984, a, THAT little bit of ''down home'' in Freeport the Municipal Stadium Speedway where people watched midget and stock car races for more than half a century - apparently will not see the green flags this year.The 10-year lease with Campi Enterprises of Freeport has expired and Freeport Mayor William H. White said: ''I doubt if the speedway will be there in 1984. It's just not economically feasible for the village.''Freeport stock car racing had a limited season from the end of May to September. Races ran on Friday and Saturday nights leaving the 13- acre 7500-seat track idle five days a week during the season.Last year the village asked the State Legislature to be allowed to sell the property to developers. Mayor White said that the village needs to increase its tax base and that the annual $70000 to $80000 received from the lease races gate parking and concessions was too little revenue. Francine Campion a member of the citizens' advisory committee created to study options for the property said ''People wanted the stadium to remain open not sold.''
 4503,  1993, a, In the gaggle of children jostling for position around Annie the cow Bryant Powell was the first to squeeze a fine stream of milk onto the ground."Yo" said the 10-year-old from Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn who had never before seen a cow. "It's cool."But when a camp counselor squirted milk into her open palm and licked it Bryant was as skeptical as the others."Can you drink that?" he asked.Bryant was one of two dozen children from some of New York's toughest neighborhoods who toured a model farm at Camp Hayden-Marks Memorial in Fishkill N.Y. The children most of whom had never seen farm animals before were to spend the next two weeks at the camp. They had marched more than a mile through the wooded countryside to a small stable where counselors tend a vegetable garden and care for animals borrowed for the camping season from local farmers.
 549,  2016, a, In the still quiet space with the afternoon light coming in from Harrison Street I could tell he was measuring my words. Finally he reached a verdict. “I don’t think you want to be my assistant. But you might want to be a playwright.”The thought had never occurred to me.I began writing plays.Years later I found out that Albee whose early goal was to be a poet had shown his poems to Thornton Wilder. Wilder apparently read each carefully then suggested Albee write plays instead. Now my playwriting career was not what Albee’s was to Wilder’s but Albee had somehow seen something in me that I had not yet seen in myself. This was another gift from Albee. Who soon became “Edward.”He helped me get a fellowship to his foundation in Montauk where writers and visual artists spend the summer in Spartan rooms carved out of an old barn. He would come by every morning with the mail and to chat. He wanted to know what we were reading. He approved of my deep dive into Franz Xaver Kroetz. He made a face when I mentioned Barbara Pym. He was I came to realize trying to cultivate taste.He spoke with contempt about Hollywood and the writers who went there. TV had yet to begin its renaissance and Hollywood was a place where writers slouched in disgrace. I held my tongue. I never revealed my admiration for Mike Nichols’s work on “Virginia Woolf” especially knowing how Edward had frowned on the film’s “hopeful” ending its “sentimental” score.I never mentioned I wished more of his plays had been made into movies in that jaggedy in-your-face Cassavetes style. That there was something exhilarating about being trapped with those monsters and their words in those fat messy close-ups. Each word of dialogue measured for its vitality its maximum punch. For its ability to do damage. To wake people up to themselves.As I write this from Los Angeles where I now write for television I often think of those words his awareness of their currency and energy their ultimate economy. This is precisely what’s needed on the small screen. It’s also what Edward Albee began encouraging in me from our first meeting.
 4629,  1992, a, More than any other initiative taken by Tokyo in the postwar era the peacekeeping bill has become the symbol of how far Japan is willing to go in fulfilling its pledges to take a greater political role in world affairs one that would be more commensurate with its economic might.But as the debate unfolded it became clear that many of Japan's leaders envision a far more active risky role than do many of its citizens who see little advantage in dispensing with the postwar prohibition on sending forces abroad. Under most current interpretations of the Constitution which was written by the American occupying force here after Japan's surrender the country's Self-Defense Forces are strictly prohibited from venturing beyond Japan's shores or engaging in acts of "collective security."Since the gulf war when Japan contributed $12 billion but no personnel to the multinational force that liberated Kuwait debate has raged here over whether the post-cold-war era requires a fundamental change in Japanese policy.Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declared passage of the bill one of his top priorities and many political analysts here believe that his tenure may depend on how skillfully he secures its passage without harming his party's chances in a critical election this summer. Many political leaders here also consider passage a prerequisite if Japan hopes to realize its ambitions to become a member of the United Nations Security Council in coming years. Public Is OpposedNonetheless polls show that the Japanese public is clearly opposed to any plan to send its troops into combat areas with many questioning whether they can yet trust their Government to keep a rein on the military. As a result the governing party -- fearful that its efforts to pass some kind of peacekeeping bill could be defeated for a third time -- has been struggling for ways to pass the core elements of the bill while at the same time at least seeming to be responsive to the public's apprehensions. And it is possible the fragile coalition being built around the bill could still collapse perhaps leading to the dissolution of both houses of Parliament and the calling of a general election.
 6108,  1977, a, Of all the annual accolades in baseball the most controversial are invariably the Most Valuable Player awards. And in the American League this season the Yankees’ most controversial player Reggie Jackson has emerged as the most controversial candidate in what looms as a most controversial election. When the Yankees hired him for nearly $3 million over five seasons. The Times Reggie Jackson was described by Thurman Munson as slugger “who cart carry a club for a month.” Reggie Jackson exceeded that reputation. Since being knighted as the cleanup hitter he has carried the Yankees for nearly two months in their quest for another Eastern Division title. For the season he has 32 home runs and 111 runs batted in.Sports of The Times“But” said a cynic recently “he's not worth $3 million.”Reggie Jackson never said he was worth that much. But when the Yankees offered him that much he accepted it. Actually the Montreal Expos offered him more than $3 million but he preferred to perform in New York where the stage suits his style. Or so he thought.But in the early months of the season Reggie Jackson was a stranger in turmoil. He feuded with Thurman Munson a rift that is not completely healed. He antagonized other teammates. And he bristled at Billy Martin who bristled back at the slugger he hadn't requested.Even now Reggie Jackson and Billy Martin coexist in an armed truce but Reggie Jackson ‘has earned the respect if not the afefction of his manager and teammates.

 2935,  2002, a, The Justice Department arrested the head of an Islamic charity in Illinois today and said there was extensive evidence that he and his organization had close ties to Osama bin Laden and had secretly funneled money to his terrorist network Al Qaeda.The man Enaam M. Arnaout 39 the Syrian-born director of the Benevolence International Foundation was arrested at his home in the Chicago suburb of Justice and charged with lying under oath in documents his group had filed in federal court. The documents were part of a suit the group filed in January against the United States government after officials seized the foundation's assets as part of the investigations into the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.In seeking to have a court unfreeze the assets Mr. Arnaout testified that the foundation was a ''faith-based humanitarian organization that engages in charitable work around the world'' and ''does not engage in or fund terrorist activity.''But in an affidavit given today by an F.B.I. agent to support its arrest warrant for Mr. Arnaout the government provided an extraordinary amount of information it had collected some of it dating back years before the Sept. 11 attacks to support the accusation that the foundation was a front to finance terrorism around the world. The affidavit of Agent Robert Walker was rich in detail about the movement of money from the Islamic charities into what it said were the pockets of Al Qaeda operatives to pay for weapons and military training of terrorists in Afghanistan Pakistan the Philippines Bosnia-Herzegovina Georgia and Chechnya.

The Governor said that she would not recommend a state takeover but might seek legislation to give her administration a greater hand in Camden's financial affairs. The fiscal year is more than half over Camden has yet to approve its budget and the state has had to give the city an extra $8.3 million to help with its $11 million deficit said Christopher B. Wolf a spokesman for the State Department of Community Affairs.Mayor Arnold W. Webster said he welcomed financial assistance from the state but he criticized state officials for failing to cooperate with his administration in solving the city's financial problems.
 6036,  1977, a, Mr. Carter said that the existing welfare structure was “worse than we thought.”The “many separate programs taken together still do not constitute a rational coherent system that is adequate and fair for all the poor” he said. “They are still overly wasteful capricious and subject to fraud. They violate many desirable and necessary principles.”Mr. Carter said that he would send Congress specific welfare legislation the first week in August. Even if the measure can be enacted early next year he said “an additional three years will be required to implement the program.”The President implied however that it might be impossible for Congress to act next year. He said that energy legislation was his “first priority for Congress” and other forthcoming proposals including those that would revise the tax and Social Security laws would have to he considered by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees the same panels that have jurisdiction over welfare measures and most of the energy package.“I'll have to depend on Congressional leaders to decide in which order they will address these measures” the President said. He said that the welfare bill to be proposed in August would meet the following 12 goals:¶No higher initial cost than the present system.¶Access to a job for at least one member of every family with children where there is a person able to work.¶Incentives for those on welfare to take jobs in the private sector.¶Public training and employment for those able to work who cannot find private jobs.¶A higher income for families who work than for those who do not.¶Incentives for families to stay together.¶A continuation of tax credits to the working poor.

 3458,  1999, a, The State Department report said Mr. bin Laden who has recently operated from bases in Afghanistan and is being sought in the United States on murder charges had ''global reach'' and offered ''logistical help to extremists not directly affiliated with his organization.''Department officials insisted that the decision not to designate Iran as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism was not meant as a gesture of good will toward Iran.Instead they said it reflected a reduction in terrorist attacks that could clearly be attributed to organizations supported by Iran. The report found that Iran apparently killed fewer Iranian dissidents abroad last year than in 1997.''There is a slight improvement in their record and we wanted to reflect that in our conclusions'' said a department official who insisted on anonymity. ''We just didn't feel the need to single them out in the way we have in the past. We obviously want to encourage better behavior.''Others in the Administration said the report had been worded in a fashion that they hoped would make clear to Iran the willingness of Washington to improve ties.''It would obviously be tough for us to go out there and brand Iran as the world's premier terrorist state while at the same time talking about our hope for better relations'' said an American official who insisted on anonymity. ''If the Iranians read this as a signal for better ties fine.''The report found that Iran ''continued to be involved in the planning and execution of terrorist acts'' and that it might have been responsible for the murders of five leading Iranian writers and political figures last year. The department also said Iran continued support a variety of terrorist groups in the Middle East including Hamas Hizballah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

As she fumbled for her mailbox key she kept muttering a litany of complaints to herself ranging from an absent nanny to her husband's shirts a thoughtless business partner and a missed yoga class. A tiny infant slept peacefully at her breast cradled in a sling.She left the mailroom and in the lobby claimed a double carriage in which sat two angelic little girls -- twins about 2. In the elevator with the buttons pushed I asked if they were identical. The harried mother looked at me. ''We don't know yet'' she said in a flip tone. ''We haven't had time to check we haven't time to do anything. But don't bother to tell me how cute or adorable they are unless you're willing to take them off my hands for the weekend.'' Alan MountBuck Glenn was waiting in line to buy stamps at a West Village post office. The woman in front of him was accompanied by her daughter perhaps 3 years old. The child was playing with the postage forms and envelopes. ''Come here'' the mother said and the girl ran to her accidentally knocking over a pile of IRS tax forms. The child stared at the forms on the floor and then stomped on them. The mother simply said ''Well done dear.''Dear Diary:My mother's Cartier watch had stopped and as it was a lovely day she decided to walk to Cartier instead of taking a taxi. Her arthritic knee acted up though and as she tottered into the store she was badly in need of help. She went to the nearest counter and said ''Young man do you think you could find me two aspirin?'' Not a usual request at Cartier I am sure but he responded with alacrity and returned with the aspirin and a glass of water. She then went to the watch department where they quickly repaired the timepiece and she took a cab home.''And so my dear'' she told me (I live in Tucson) ''if you're ever in New York and need an aspirin just go to Cartier and ask.''Conchita CollinsJoan Pursley thought she had heard every possible street request for money but she got a new one during the last cold spell. As she got out of a cab at the Avenue of the Americas and 14th Street she was approached by a man with a cup who said ''Can you help me? I'm trying to get to Hawaii.'' She usually hands out change but she was so amused she gave him $1.

 4098,  1995, a, She was 11 when the New York City Ballet production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" came to Los Angeles. She was cast as a bug. Standing on stage gazing up at company principals like Edward Villella Arthur Mitchell and Suzanne Farrell she became infatuated with dance. Five years later Ms. Watts came to New York to study at the School of American Ballet. She was nearly expelled for defying every rule -- often missing class cavalierly showing up late -- penchants that might have precluded a dancing career were it not for Balanchine who saw the potential in the skinny rebellious girl with the broad shoulders amazing extensions and powerful jump."Balanchine made me dance" she now says."Don't be reverent about my ballets; just dance" he would tell her.So she danced and sometimes even she was pleased with her performance. "There are nights when you are lucky enough to tap into something about yourself that you are unaware of and can't possibly control" Ms. Watts says "and somehow at that moment other people can view it or sense it or feel it."Yet she never relinquished her defiance. She was outspoken undiplomatic possessed of great intelligence and a greater ability to charm and offend. Capable of warm generosity or a rudeness that could verge on cruelty she was given to extremes of emotion that inspired extremes of approval and disapproval from others. As the years went by she established herself on stage and off as a fiercely commanding presence whose preferred attire was a baseball cap and an oversize T-shirt a controversial figure who was never what ballerinas are supposed to be. "I guess that ballerinas are supposed to be quiet" she says.Nothing made her more controversial than her long relationship with Peter Martins with whom she lived worked and fought bitterly often in public. The union began in 1969 when she was 16 and he was a 23-year-old principal dancer with City Ballet and continued into the 1980's when he became the company's artistic director. "We grew up together" is how they both tended to put it. And they stayed tied in ways that suggest that certain bonds run long and deep and are difficult to sever."As a dancer Heather was wiry and weird and didn't dance in a usual fashion" Mr. Martins recalls. "She could do classical things lyrical things. You couldn't categorize her."
 6074,  1977, a, WASHINGTON Aug. 1 — Severa prominent medical research institutions and Government hospitals in the United States and Canada were involved in secret 25‐year $25‐million effort by the Central Intelligence Agency to learn hovl to control the human mind.The existence of the agency's investiga. tions into behavior and thought control was previously known. But through ac. cess to 2000 C.I.A. documents and wideranging interviews a group of New York Times reporters has developed new information about the cost of the program the range of its penetration into prestigious research centers the identities of some institutions the secret funding conduits of the agency and the concerns about the program expressed by some scientists.The original research was spurred by the conviction‐later proved unfounded ‐that the Russians and Chinese had developed brainwashing and mind‐control devices. But the C.I.A. quickly turned to seeking an offensive use for behavior control. It sought to crack the mental defenses of enemy agents‐to be able to program them and its own operatives to carry out any mission even against their will and “against such fundamental laws of nature as self‐preservation.”Three Foundations UsedIt channeled funds through three private medical research foundations. One of these the Geschikter Foundation for Medical Research in Washington D.O.; is still active. Another the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology Inc.. was disbanded in 1965. A third named in one report was the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation also active but Dr. John'W. Bowers director of the foundation said there was no indication it had been a conduit for C.I.A. funding.

 7418,  1964, a, TO THE EDITOR:I applaud Dr. Foster's suggestion that we reevaluate our physical fitness programs but I am concerned that the casual reader will conclude that now he can with good stop exercising. This is not so. We cannot stop moving because to live is to move. Let us learn to do it as efficiently and lly as possible and at the same time learn to conserve the human body.Women whom Dr. Foster dismissed in a brief two‐sentence paragraph have probably come closer to realizing this than men. Women know that the shape given to them by nature must be carefully cultivated throughout the years and that the only way this can really be done is through proper diet and effective g. As a result of g they sense a greater feeling of well‐being and remain younger‐in looks and in feeling.One element of aging is loss of flexibility. Regain and increase that element and a great deal has been achieved. Could all this have something to do with women outliving men ?
 6051,  1977, a, PARIS Friday June 3—The 27‐nation north‐south talks ended tonight with major oil‐producing countries and other developing lands refusing to agree to the. demands of the United States and the rest of the industrial world for continuing consultations on energy questions.While the eight so‐called rich countriesof the north thus failed to achieve their principal objectives the 19 developing or poor countries of the south won some economic concessions in the form of pledges of assistance. But they regarded the pledges as inadequate.The disappointment of both sides was expressed in the communiqué issued at the end of 18 months of talks whose aim had been to agree on a program of international economic reforms to help the poorer ‐countries of the world and improve the industrial countries'. relations with them.The developing countries said “the results fall short of the objectives envisaged” although they recognized that “certain progress has been made.” The industrial countries expressed regret at the lack of agreement on energy but welcomed “the spirit of cooperation in which on the whole the conference took place.”

 4955,  1990, a, Britain and six Southeast Asian nations plan a new attempt to persuade the Bush Administration and the Vietnamese Government to agree to the forced return of thousands of Vietnamese boat people later this summer.The six Asian nations are warning that unless the forcible repatriation is accepted they will no longer allow boat people to land and an international plan for looking after these refugees will collapse.The diplomatic campaign which diplomats say will involve high level appeals in Washington and Hanoi next month is intended to secure American and Vietnamese backing for the return of boat people who are deemed to be economic migrants rather than political refugees by July 1.Asians Present an UltimatumThis deadline was set at a meeting in Manila earlier this month of the 29 countries that drew up the Comprehensive Plan of Action on Indochinese Refugees at a United Nations-sponsored conference in Geneva last year. If the United States and Vietnam agree these countries will meet again in Geneva on June 26 to prepare the repatriation.

The affidavit says that Dennehy pointed his gun at Dotson as if to shoot him and that Dotson responded by shooting Dennehy in the head.No charges have been filed against Dotson and Dennehy's body has not been found.''They were the best of friends'' said LaDonna Newton a senior at Baylor who lived one floor below them at the Sterling Apartment complex. ''They were inseparable. I never saw them around anyone else but each other. I really don't see how an altercation could have gotten that far out of control.''She said the last time she saw Dotson was when he came by her apartment a few weeks ago to play the board game Life.

To make his portraits he had to visit the Netherlands — where a group of under-20s was gathered for a tournament — as well as Salt Lake City Dallas and Norway.

 106,  2019, a, The eldest child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy Joseph Jr. was set to enter his final year at Harvard Law School in 1943 but instead volunteered to serve as flier for the United States Navy in World War II.He was sent to England and died during a secret mission when an experimental aircraft loaded with explosives blew up over the English Channel.The family was together in Hyannis Port on a Sunday afternoon in August when two priests came with news of his death at age 29.“My father took the two men upstairs” Eunice Kennedy Shriver Joseph Jr.’s sister said later. “A little while later he came down and said ‘We’ve lost Joe.’”“Then he went back upstairs to his room and locked the door.”When Joe Jr. was born his grandfather Mayor John F. Fitzgerald of Boston announced to the news media that the newborn would become president someday.
 1622,  2009, a, I really like today’s Friday puzzle by Martin Ashwood-Smith. He’s a frequent contributor to CrosSynergy puzzles but we haven’t seen his name at The Times in over three years.ADLAI is a common crossword name. When the former American Dreamer and Illinois governor gets his last name in the puzzle as well it always includes his middle initial E (for Ewing) to make it a full 15 letters. It’s just one of eight horizontal full-width answers and they’re all good — solid answers with great clues. My favorites are the first and last.There is a lot of fun in the fill too. “Not be picky with an instrument?” There’s another way to play that guitar. I love the “Word associated with a light bulb.” It’s not WATT or SCONCE or anything hardware-related but it’s a nice AHA moment with the mystery unfolds.BEDE is a crossword staple usually clued either as the “Venerable” monk or in reference to the 1859 novel Adam Bede by George Eliot. George later caused a stir by admitting that her real name was Mary Ann Evans. Ban Ki-moon became secretary general of the United Nations two years ago succeeding Kofi ANNAN.There are two three-letter answers I love. “One whose deposits are often collected” is a HEN of course. And even better is “Seventeen people briefly.” Well let’s see what would be the proper abbreviation for a decaseptet? Wrong track as any junior high girl can tell you. Seventeen is a magazine. Ah …

 4724,  1991, a, Even as the report reached Mr. Dinkins the Transit Authority was notified of the first of what is expected to be many lawsuits by injured passengers -- in this case a $15 million damage claim by a 23-year-old rider Pamela Owens of Brooklyn who said she had gone four hours without emergency treatment and had suffered permanent lung damage from smoke inhalation. Recommendations MadeIn its recommendations the report which had been requested by the Mayor and was signed by First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel suggested that the Transit Authority directly and immediately notify the Police and Fire Departments and the Emergency Medical Services in future emergencies.It also urged that the authority participate more fully in city planning for emergencies; suggested that E.M.S. crews receive training and breathing apparatus to enable them to go into smoky tunnels to treat patients sooner and urged that the authority and the E.M.S. jointly arrange for buses to carry large amounts of oxygen to major emergencies."It's better to be safe than sorry" Mr. Dinkins said late yesterday as he released the report at a City Hall news conference. Transit Agency Takes ExceptionAlan F. Kiepper president of the Transit Authority also appeared at the news conference and disputed the report's conclusion that miscues of communication by his agency were responsible for delaying and misdirecting the rescue efforts. He insisted there was no breakdown in communications."After having reviewed the transcripts of the communication that took place" he said "what was communicated was the best information to our people that was available at the time. In my judgment they gave the best information they had. I believe our personnel performed well."Mr. Kiepper conceded that some communications could have been speeded but he said: "It's easy to make judgments three days later about what could have been done. Keep in mind our first concern was getting the passengers away from the source of the flames and smoke."
 2410,  2005, a, THE stalls at local farmers' markets are filling out like cornfields in July. Each week there are more choices even more farmers. As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. For each the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different. Exact market locations and times are at www.cenyc.org www.nyfarmersmarket.com and www.communitymarkets.biz.Greens Yes But Especially August CornSue and Henry Smith planned to be teachers. But Mr. Smith told his father a truck farmer in Rockland County in New York that he would farm too. He never left the land and he and his wife now own Sycamore Farms in Middletown N.Y. They grow strawberries peas and hothouse tomatoes but pride themselves most on their corn. It is picked the evening before they go to the Greenmarket and arrives in time for the market's opening. On Saturdays they bring a second batch at 10:30 a.m. They sell it earlier than most -- by the Fourth of July -- because they start some under plastic a sort of hothouse. Their season continues until the end of October or the first frost.AVAILABLE -- Mr. Smith said the corn after Aug. 1 has better flavor because it takes longer to mature. "For early corn you sacrifice eating quality for availability" he said.SELECTING -- Let them choose the ears for you but if you do it don't strip the leaves to inspect the kernels; it hastens the aging of the rejects. "Make sure there are no holes in the husk" Mrs. Smith said. "Then if you run your hand tightly down the outside you just want to feel a uniform cob with no indentations and skips." Drying on leaves or at the cut end mean the corn is not fresh.

 124,  2019, a, Since its inception FOIA has rightly been denounced as a weak and ineffective law but The Times continues to aggressively pursue documents through the statute doing what we have done repeatedly over the past 15 years: going to court to challenge the government’s refusal to release materials that the public should see. The Times has brought more FOIA suits over the last decade than any other mainstream media organization in the country.A study by the nonprofit group TRAC found that The Times had filed 31 FOIA lawsuits during the Obama years. Our peer news organizations around the country — the major newspapers wire services and broadcasters — filed 10 collectively. A subsequent TRAC study found that The Times continued to be the leading filer among media organizations over the first year and a half of the Trump administration. The Times has now filed 27 FOIA lawsuits in the Trump years. (A handful of public interest groups and newer media outlets in particular BuzzFeed and the Center for Public Integrity have also been out front in pursuing litigation.)So why do we devote so much time to trying to make a deeply flawed law work?It’s not because it’s easy. Our FOIA litigation is done in house by our now three-lawyer team with our First Amendment Fellow Al-Amyn Sumar playing the pivotal role. We have been helped in several cases by a FOIA clinic at Yale Law School. We spend hundreds of hours each year filing the suits writing briefs negotiating with government lawyers and going to court. We know better than anyone that FOIA cases are frustrating; the deck is stacked against us and the lawsuits drag on for months and years.But one part of our motivation is pretty simple: We manage to win documents. Between successful court decisions and settlements in which the agencies agree to reverse course and give us documents we regularly make a small dent in governmental secrecy.In the past year we have assisted our reporters in unlocking documents on topics ranging from gun control and herbicides to foreign lobbyists and federal land disputes in the West. In June The Times published a report about Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s efforts to include her relatives in meetings during an official trip to China in October of 2017. Emails obtained through a FOIA lawsuit showed that the trip had been canceled after ethics concerns were raised with officials in the State and Transportation Departments.

 6237,  1973, a, He is considered an extremely capable and tough officer—“the best they have” one American analyst said.With his arrival at Tan Son Nhut Air Base where the Communist delegations are quartered and working the four chief delegates are now all present. The North Vietnamese leader Maj. Gen. Le Quang Hoa arrived Monday.Officials close to the military commission said that yesterday's session which was attended only by the deputy heads of the delegations showed a marked improvement in atmosphere over the three previous days when the Vietcong delegates had at first refused to present their credentials.“I've been quite heartened by the progress” one official said. The official who said he could give no details of the meetings because of strict orders to keep the sessions secret added that he expected the military commission might now be able to start sending out its seven regional inspection teams “perhaps by early next week.”The Paris agreement specified that the seven regional teams were to be in place by last Tuesday.It was also believed that the four heads of the delegations would hold their first formal meeting today. So far only their deputies have met.The North Vietnamese and Vietcong delegates who are living in a ramshackle compound of former United States Army barracks inside the air base have been carefully guarded oy South Vietnamese military police and have had no contact with either ordinary. South Vietnamese or with the press.Yesterday however according to a reliable United States official the North Vietnamese requested permission to visit a market off the base “to get some fresh fruit and vegetables.” The Communist reportedly said they were satisfied with the South Vietnamese military rations they have been fed but would appreciate a change in diet.

The Bush administration however said it would investigate. A1Troops' Bodies Recovered Three days after a Chinook helicopter went down in combat in Afghanistan American troops recovered the bodies of all 16 who were aboard military officials said.

 5843,  1984, a, MONDAY OCTOBER 1 1984 International Preliminary talks with Moscow on arms control and other issues are expected to begin within a few weeks as a result of conversations with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko Reagan Administration officials said. But they said they doubted actual negotiations would resume before the end of this year or early next year. (Page A1 Column 6.) Jordan's renewal of ties with Egypt was defended by King Hussein. He challenged Syria Libya and other critics of his decision to restore full diplomatic relations to come to a summit meeting to debate this and other issues that have divided Arab ranks. Syria turned down the King's invitation. (A1:2.)China renewed overtures to Taiwan regarding reunification with the Communist mainland. Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang reiterated Peking's offer to let Taiwan retain its capitalist economic and social system if it was reunited with the mainland. China has said Taiwan would become a special administrative region like Hong Kong but could have even broader autonomy. (A1:5.) An anti-Mafia roundup in Italy brought dozens of organized crime figures into custody. Officials described it as one of the most sweeping anti-Mafia operations ever conducted in Italy. The nationwide arrests began after a Mafia leader gave what officials described as detailed information on many crimes. (A1:3.) Cairo's chief judge gave prison terms to 107 Moslem extemists for trying to overthrow the Government in the aftermath of the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat. He acquitted 174 others. (A6:3.) National The most unfavorable TV coverage of President Reagan since he began his re-election campaign according to White Housde advisers focused on his impromptu remarks on the bombing of the United States Embassy in Lebanon. Both sides regard Mr. Reagan's tendency toward misstatement as a ''wild card'' in the national televised debates scheduled for Oct. 7 and Oct. 21 and this leads some Democrats to hope Walter F. Mondale can claw his way back into contention in the Presidential race. (A1:1.) The tough and sassy Queens parlance of Geraldine Ferraro has become the surprise hit of the campaign season. When she was chosen by Walter Mondale as his running mate his aides privately worried that her speech might be ''too tough'' and ''too New York wise guy'' to play in proverbial Peoria. But they have watched with relief and growing admiration as her colloquial diction and frankness have charmed audiences from Texas to California. (A1:1.) Do-it-yourself health testing devices are enabling people to check themselves for early symptoms of illness from the onset of stress to certain forms of cancer. Rapid changes in technology especially the development of smaller and cheaper computer chips have led to such consumer medical products as the Ames Glucometer the Astropulse and the E.P.T. Plus. Physicians say home testing can be useful but they warn against self-diagnosis. (A1:4.) Failing citrus farms in Florida hit by a freeze last winter are another threat to the industry and to the hopes of growers like the Symmes family. On The Ridge near Orlando the prospect of foreclosure unpaid taxes or having to sell out to developers are not related to the recent discovery of the citrus canker that has ruined other Florida groves. (A14:2.) An extension of spending levels for most Government agencies is expected to be approved today by the House. The Senate has approved the two-day extension to the keep the agencies operating. The measure would provide Congress with a 48- hour respite in its struggle to adopt a catchall spending resolution to keep the Government running in the new fiscal year which began this morning. The respite is needed beause the Senate version of the spending bill is mired in a controversy involving a civil rights measure that supporters hope to attach to it. (A17:1.) Metropolitan Innovative prison construction is being used as states try to solve the problem of prison overcrowding. An example of this is the Southern State Correctional Facility in New Jersey which looks like an Army training camp. It is the state's answer to how to build a prison in a hurry and at relatively low cost. (B2:1.) Fordham University's 31st president was installed in ceremonies at the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. He is the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare who was born in the Bronx 53 years ago. He succeeds the Rev. James C. Finlay who retired in July. (B3:3.) Two teen-aged youths were arrested in the Bronx and charged with shooting a woman with an air pistol Thursday night at 97th Street and West Avenue in Manhattan. The police believe they were responsible for seven similar shootings in the Bronx and Manhattan Thursday night and early Friday morning. (B5:3.) A World Trade Center skyscraper will get underway tomorrow in the lower Manhattan block bounded by Vesey Washington and Barclay Streets and West Broadway. The 47- story building will rise from a trapezoidal base. It will be the center's seventh and final building. (B16:4.) Page D1
 3327,  2000, a, That truism is reflected in the way the convention program is structured. Virtually all the major speeches this week from those of Laura Bush and Gen. Colin L. Powell tonight and continuing with Senator John McCain and Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday the vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney on Wednesday and Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday are to take place between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. That just happens to be the hour each night that one or more of the over-the-air networks will be covering the Philadelphia proceedings live.''Everything is geared for the 10 to 11 o'clock hour'' said Tom Hannon the political director of CNN. ''They're obsessed about getting their message across in the 10 to 11 hour and that is their driving concern. People say that the conventions are for cable but as far as the parties are concerned the conventions are for the most eyeballs they can get.''Tonight the Republicans got those eyeballs at least on ABC but not exactly the program they had concocted. Like clockwork the preseason football game -- begun an hour early to accommodate the convention coverage -- ended a few minutes before 10 p.m. paving the way for Peter Jennings to introduce several minutes of highlights before seguing about a third of the way into a speech by Laura Bush. CBS broke into its ''48 Hours'' program early with an update and returned at 10:30 to cover the final half-hour.Viewers of ABC got a taste of what cable and PBS broadcast all night: an unusual showcase for multiculturalism. It was certainly the ''different'' sort of Republican evening the planners promised: videos of Gospel choirs and vignettes of inner-city school students who were used at times to underline the Bush campaign's promises of a more inclusive kind of Republicanism and to reinvigorate education reform.Governor and Mrs. Bush -- the former appearing by satellite from a classroom in Westerville Ohio -- both spoke with backdrops consisting of children seated at desks. For Mrs. Bush's remarks ABC even spliced in footage from a graduation ceremony in Crawford Tex. that the Bushes had attended.

 1174,  2012, a, John Sommers Ii/ReutersDUBLIN Ohio — Because of bad weather in the morning Rory Sabbatini didn’t start his second round at the Memorial until well after 3 p.m. To pass the time he watched a documentary about the reggae star Bob Marley. Playing in overcast windy conditions Sabbatini scored so well he could be forgiven for whistling “The Sun Is Shining” from Marley’s song list.With his second consecutive 69 Sabbatini took a one-stroke lead at the halfway point at six-under. His best finish in 2012 was a tie for ninth in his first start the Tournament of Champions. In his previous start a tie for 47th at Colonial Sabbatini birdied four of his final eight holes to build some much-needed momentum.“On Sunday I was playing awfully and managed to turn things around over the last eight holes” Sabbatini said “and I think that kind of maybe flicked a switch on for me and kind of reminded me of what I can do. So coming into this week I was definitely a little more adamant and a little more positive about my game and it’s just it’s all so fortuitous.”Sabbatini a six-time winner on the tour said he was inspired by the Marley documentary. “Great life lesson” he said. “I’ve actually always loved his music and I’ve known a lot about him but just really to see his attitude towards life and just his attitude in general is admirable and something that all of us could only aspire to be.”As for what he aspires to shoot in the third round Sabbatini said “I always say let’s shoot seven shots better on Saturday than I do on Friday so I’ll take that.”To the disappointment of many Sabbatini will not be paired in the third round with Tiger Woods who is among the three players sitting one stroke back. In the spring of 2007 Sabbatini got Woods’s attention when he said he relished playing against Woods and proclaimed him “as beatable as ever.” Sabbatini’s brashness is as much a personal trademark as his cowboy hats.“Obviously it’s great to see him playing well” Sabbatini said. “There’s a lot of good names on that leaderboard. Ultimately I’m not worried about what he’s doing or anyone else is doing. I’m focused on myself. Ultimately it comes down to the challenge inside me and that’s what I’ve got to focus on.”
 4064,  1996, a, In such an otherwise irreverent context this amounts to undue pretension since so much of the dialogue is lost and upstaged anyhow. Fortunately this film's young lovers played radiantly by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio have the requisite magic and speak their lines with passionate conviction. They remain rapt and earnest even when some of the film's frantic minor players might as well be speaking in tongues.With an opening sequence edited in the high-voltage style of a movie trailer this ''Romeo and Juliet'' does not initially promise much in the way of sincerity. As he introduces the Capulets and the Montagues as two warring Florida street gangs screaming threats and driving cars with vanity plates (''CAP 005'') Mr. Luhrmann starts the film at full fever pitch. He hurls the audience into a world where clothes graffiti signs and billboards become Shakespearean artifacts with a touch of camp. Catherine Martin's gaudy spectacular production design is high drama in its own right.By the same logic that turned Juliet's balcony into a Manhattan fire escape for ''West Side Story'' this film draws on watery settings so that its lovers can quite literally take the plunge and it nearly turns the Capulets' costume ball into ''Priscilla Queen of Verona.'' (Mercutio played by Harold Perrineau is now a black drag queen in a white wig.) Dressed to ravishing effect as a knight and an angel Romeo and Juliet meet here and bring the film to a much-needed mood change.The frenzy gives way to a tenderness that makes sense in any language or with no language at all as Mr. Luhrmann lets the camera swirl adoringly around the film's young stars. Just when ''Romeo and Juliet'' has almost fatally pushed its luck -- with the sight of Paul Sorvino raving in purple spangles as Juliet's father say or with many comparable affronts -- it is still able to summon flashes of purity and beauty.Eventually switching gears too often and sinking under the weight of its random excesses ''Romeo and Juliet'' still sustains a remarkable amount of fire. Among its more striking inventions are Sycamore Grove where Romeo does his brooding imagined as a seaside stage and the banishment of Romeo to a trailer in this desert. Pete Postlethwaite as a tattooed Father Laurence and Miriam Margolyes as Juliet's zesty nurse are among the actors who successfully compete with the scenery. It's a daunting task.
 2011,  2007, a, National Journal is set to release its ideology ratings based on votes in Congress for current lawmakers and its findings for some of the presidential contenders are somewhat surprising given their reputations.On a scale of one to 100 with 100 being the most liberal here are the Democratic contenders’ lifetime ratings:Senator Barack Obama: 84.3Representative Dennis Kucinich: 79.4Senator Christopher J. Dodd: 79.2Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton: 78.8Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.: 76.8On a scale of one to 100 with 100 being the most conservative here are the Republican contenders’ lifetime ratings:Representative Duncan Hunter: 82.5Senator Sam Brownback: 81Representative Tom Tancredo: 75.9Senator John McCain: 71.8Senator Chuck Hagel: 71.5Representative Ron Paul: 51.7Those lifetime numbers however aren’t the whole story. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for example shows a “clear-cut shift” from among the most liberal during the first half of her term to more moderate over the last three years writes Richard E. Cohen. In 2006 despite his reputation for being a maverick Senator Chuck Hagel was more conservative than either of the other G.O.P. senators in the race. The report will be available at National Journal’s website early Friday morning.Speaking of Senator Clinton get ready for the spectacle on Sunday in Selma Alabama. Not only are she and Senator Barack Obama going to walk the Edmund Pettus Bridge in commemoration of those who fought for civil rights she will be joined by her husband former President Bill Clinton on the march. Both the senators are speaking at churches there that day; Mr. Clinton himself is being inducted into the Voting Rights Hall of Fame.McCain’s “Wasted” GaffeMr. McCain backed away from his comment to David Letterman on Wednesday that “we wasted a lot of our most precious treasure which is American lives over there.”Democrats demanded that Mr. McCain apologize for saying the lives were “wasted” much as Republicans called for Mr. Obama’s apology when he said “We now have spent $400 billion and have seen over 3000 lives of the bravest young Americans wasted.”Mr. Obama who apologized and called his own words “a slip of the tongue” said did not say Mr. McCain owes an apology.We have a duty a sacred duty to make sure we are honoring their sacrifice by giving them missions in which they can succeed. I’m positive that was the intent in which he meant it. It was the same intent that I had when I made my statement John McCain and I may have disagreements. The one area that I don’t think he can be questioned is his dedication to American troops. He’s been there. He’s done that.Indeed Mr. McCain did not give one. He said in a statement from his Senate office that he “should have used the word ‘sacrificed’ as I have in the past.”Pence for President?Given that the Republican frontrunners have not always been reliably conservative rumors about vacuum-filling candidacies by popular conservatives have been popping up regularly. The latest is about Representative Mike Pence of Indiana. He’s got a prominent speaking slot at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington this weekend and there’s also a grassroots site Pence08.com.“Congressman Pence has not ruled out a run in the near term or the long term” said Matt Lloyd Mr. Pence’s spokesman. The Hotline’s Marc Ambinder translated: “In other words: Pence is quite comfortable with the buzz.”F.E.C. Rules for ObamaAs expected the Federal Election Commission officially agreed this morning to let Mr. Obama collect money for the general election but give it all back to receive public financing if he chooses to later. (That’s if he became the Democratic nominee.) Both nominees would have to agree to participate in the public financing system under this plan. The F.E.C. made it clear today that the procedures set for Mr. Obama’s potential opt-in later on weren’t necessarily the ones that other candidates could follow to opt for public financing.Edwards College TourJohn Edwards is kicking off his four-city college tour today at the Metropolitan State College of Denver (the city where Mr. Edwards hopes to be named the nominee at the Democrats’ convention next year). He’ll hit University of California at Berkeley (that historical bastion of student activism) on Sunday then U.C. Los Angeles on Monday and Howard University in Washington on March 14.Despite the fact that the Edwards campaign has perhaps the most extensive web presence of any candidate from either party Mr. Edwards has not made remarkable strides among young voters. A new analysis by Young Voter Strategies a nonprofit group out of the George Washington University shows young voters prefer Mr. Edwards at about the same frequency as Democrats generally — putting him around third place nationally. On the other hand Mr. Obama “draws stronger support from young adults than from any other age group” according to the report.

Lippman was born in Brooklyn eldest of three brothers. He graduated from City College of New York and Yale Law School. Most of his legal career was devoted to preventing the break-up of AT&T. Judge Harold Greene once suggested that Lippmans piece of the case was succeeding. When AT&T voluntarily broke itself up Lippman went on to study history and literature in graduate school which led to the publication of his book "The Binding of Isaac Religious Murders and Kaballah..." In addition he served as Assistant Editor of Judiasm Magazine and lectured on Abraham and Isaac at Bergen Community College Institute for Learning in Retirement. For about 30 years Lippman was a serious amateur Cantor for two different congregations and widely known as a teacher of his own cantorial style which incorporated classical historical cantorial literarure with other classical music which illustrated the liturgy. On the lighter end he directed productions of Gilbert and Sullivan Fiddler on the Roof and others for his congregation. Survivors include former wife Joan Krauss brother Fred Bodoff children Miriam Ben Yashar (Jerusalem) David Bodoff (Tel Aviv) grandchildren Ken and Adi Ben Yashar Liam and Noam Bodoff dearly loved nieces and nephews and in particular his adored and adoring wife Psychiatrist Meri Schachter Bodoff.

 4054,  1996, a, Since World War I Fort Amador has been the jewel of the American military presence here dominating the Pacific Ocean entrance of the Panama Canal. But on Tuesday the 207-acre site which includes the residence of the United States Army commander is to be transferred to Panamanian control.The change is the beginning of a marked acceleration in the pace of the American withdrawal from Panama. Over the next year the United States is also scheduled to hand over Albrook Air Force Station Gorgas Hospital and the Arraijan fuel depot and reduce its strength here from 6800 to 4400 soldiers.In addition by the time the Federal Government's 1997 fiscal year ends next Sept. 30 the headquarters of the United States Southern Command here on Quarry Heights in one form or another since 1916 plans to have left for its new billet in Miami.Among Panamanians that prospect has awakened as much apprehension as pride.With barely three years remaining before the final American departure this country of 2.5 million people finds itself rummaging for ways to put these newly reverting areas to use and gradually realizing that maintenance costs will be huge especially if private investment projects fail to materialize.

 4673,  1992, a, CONSUMERS may have less money to spend but dining out is decidedly not out.According to the National Restaurant Association the average family spends 43 cents of every food dollar at restaurants. That number which includes everything from takeout pizza to meals on airliners has never been higher. This year the group estimates that food service sales will reach $262 billion up 5.6 percent from the $248 billion spent in 1991.Such statistics have helped the stocks of most publicly traded restaurant companies hold their own fairly well this year after a banner performance in 1991. For the year through last Friday the 23 restaurant stocks tracked on a daily basis by Montgomery Securities have declined by 6 percent compared with a 1 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 400 average.In some respects the drop should have been expected because prices of those same stocks rose a hefty 59 percent in 1991 compared with a 27 percent increase in the S.& P. 400 average.That the drop this year was only 6 percent is surprising given that the industry has seen no growth in spending on an inflation-adjusted basis in nearly three years and is raising prices at the slowest pace in close to three decades.

 4735,  1991, a, To the Editor:My "debate" at Fordham University with Michael F. Armstrong ("Feuding Lawyers Get a Hearing; Their Peers an Earful" news article Jan. 19) did as your reporter correctly noted turn into a credibility contest. It is often difficult to determine who is telling the truth in such a contest but in this case it should be rather simple. Mr. Armstrong had told a reporter for Manhattan Inc. magazine that "one of the judges [ at a Second Circuit judicial conference ] had forbidden [ Dershowitz ] ever to return to his courtroom again. It was because of the way he behaved in the courtroom."At our debate Mr. Armstrong said that in fact two Federal judges had excluded me from their courtrooms (at first he claimed they were both in the audience but when pressed he backed away from that assertion).Excluding a lawyer from a judge's courtroom is a very serious matter. Federal courts being courts of record require that all rulings must be a matter of written record. If I had ever been excluded from the courtroom by a New York Federal judge -- which I most certainly have not -- it would be a matter of written record.I challenge Mr. Armstrong to produce the records of the two judges he claims excluded me because "of the way [ I ] behaved in [ their ] courtroom." He will not be able to because the events that Mr. Armstrong said occurred never in fact took place. ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ Cambridge Mass. Jan. 21 1991

 4973,  1990, a, To the Editor:Was Franz Werfel baptized into the Roman Catholic Church after his death? The Rev. E. J. Mattimoe writes that he couldn't have been and implies that only your reviewer John Simon thinks he was (Letters June 10). But Peter Stephan Jungk's biography states that he was and declares that Alma Mahler Werfel was lying when she denied it. We have to conclude that a ceremony was performed even though Father Mattimoe says it was invalid. What was the disposition of Werfel's soul after this event which may have been an improper event? We shall have to wait awhile for the answer to that one.ERIC BENTLEYNew York

 1147,  2012, a, When Stone Phillips formerly of “Dateline NBC” learned of a first-of-its-kind study in 2011 at Virginia Tech about the magnitude of head impacts on youth football players his journalistic instincts kicked in.“I thought the study was really important and I wanted to get it out there” he said.So Mr. Phillips who sustained two concussions as a high school and college football player began reporting and he eventually paid to produce his own news report about the subject. The report about 14 minutes long and featuring his on-camera interviews with researchers would not have looked out of place on “Dateline” where he was a co-anchor until 2007. But instead he posted it on his own barebones Web site StonePhillipsReports.com. The report compares youth football players who are battered by tackles to “bobblehead dolls.”Now in a twist that may reveal something about the way the media world works these days Mr. Phillips’s online report called “Hard Hits Hard Numbers” is being used for television. On Monday night PBS is scheduled to show a slightly condensed version on the “NewsHour” its flagship nightly newscast. His title will be special correspondent.The show picked up the report after Linda Winslow the “NewsHour” executive producer was told about the Phillips Web site by Neal Shapiro the president of the PBS station WNET in New York who ran NBC News for a time when Mr. Phillips was there. For Mr. Phillips it was just a happy if unexpected turn of events. “I did not have any plans for it to be broadcast” he said. “I was perfectly happy to have it be on the Web site.”PBS wound up covering a portion of his out-of-pocket expenses.For the report which was his first since leaving “Dateline” Mr. Phillips hired a freelance television crew that he had used in the past. After the interviews were recorded in Virginia a freelance editor came to Mr. Phillips’s home in a New York City suburb and set up his professional editing software in the home office to stitch the report together. Mr. Phillips subsequently cut about two minutes from it for Monday’s broadcast.Mr. Phillips said he would be tackling a couple of other topics for his Web site in the future including one on mental health and one on reading disabilities. But he will produce the projects on his own timetable. “The great thing about the Web” he said “is that I can do it the way I want to do it.”

A United States District Court jury found Thursday in favor of the defendants the Sony Corporation the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and the Victor Company of Japan.Go-Video filed an antitrust lawsuit in 1987 against more than 20 defendants contending that they had conspired to block the manufacture and sale of the VCR-2 because they had not been able to put the device together themselves.

 2209,  2006, a, Those differing perceptions of flood control help explain why Donald E. Powell federal coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding announced on Thursday that the levees in the New Orleans region that were being rebuilt would not meet the insurance standard of protecting against a 100-year flood the category that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.The announcement was in many ways a candid admission that the old ways of building flood protection no longer applied.Mr. Powell insisted that the $3.4 billion in work currently under way would make the levee system stronger than ever and prevent catastrophic failure in another storm of Hurricane Katrina's strength.But he said work to bring the levees up to the standard required by the insurance agency would require as much as $6 billion in additional spending to raise levee heights replace suspect floodwalls and take other corrective action.If FEMA cannot certify the flood-stopping power of the levees the agency's maps will have to treat them as if they are not there. In other words as if the land behind them is unprotected.That will have a significant effect on how neighborhoods will be rebuilt how high off the ground homes will have to be constructed and the cost of insurance.In the old days before Hurricane Katrina and before global warming experts assumed that New Orleans was protected by the levees that the corps had built. Since then however the emerging science of weather and climate change has led to an understanding that the world is entering a cycle of stronger and more frequent storms with higher surges and waves.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Problems with the original design have also been found.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyFundamentally the notion of what constitutes a powerful storm has been altered."We now have a new storm of record" Mr. Hitchings said. "Katrina."The data drawn from the experience of last August changes the equation of risk he said.For all the new data however the levee system that the corps has been building is largely based on a model of a hurricane derived from data first collected in 1959. By the 70's the National Weather Service had conducted new research that suggested that definition was too weak but the corps did not alter its plans to accommodate the new data."The corps once it's locked on a track will not take input from outside groups" said Ivor van Heerden a leader of the task force investigating the levee breaches for Louisiana and a professor with the hurricane center at Louisiana State University.In a recent interview Col. Lewis F. Setliff the head of the team rebuilding levees said the corps was not like the man on the street who is free to do what he pleases and change his mind at will. "We have to have a law in Congress that tells us to do something" Colonel Setliff said.Robert G. Bea a professor of engineering at the University of California Berkeley said the problem with that lack of flexibility was that "the data is not stable." Even the repairs Professor Bea said are problematic."They're building new walls but they're building them to the old standard" he said. "But we already know the old standard is inadequate."The corps has undertaken a two-year project at the request of Congress to propose substantial upgrades for hurricane protection in southern Louisiana. A preliminary report from that project is due in June with a final report in December 2007.If the study comes up with proposals for what the people of Louisiana say they truly want protection against the strongest Category 5 storms the cost would make the additional $6 billion look like a bargain. But it would more than exceed the insurance needs Mr. Hitchings said adding "Obviously if it was Category 5 it would be much bigger than 100-year protection."D. J. Nordquist a spokeswoman for Mr. Powell said that "there's obviously a bigger question" facing New Orleans which will always have the threat of storms.Advertisement Continue reading the main story"What level of protection are people comfortable with and what are they willing to spend?" Ms. Nordquist asked. "What's even feasible?"

 5069,  1989, a, For the most part those babies were either abandoned in hospitals at birth born with drugs in their systems or brought to the hospitals suffering from neglect or abuse.The study found 58 of the children about 60 percent were still in foster care in 1988 many because the paper work had not been done on time. Both the city and the private agencies who place children under contract were found to be at fault. 'Results Are Shocking'The 73-page report said that in 46 percent of the cases the agencies had failed to file a petition to end parental rights on time. In another 46 percent the city failed to respond on time to requests to put children up for adoption or to place them elsewhere.''The results are shocking'' Mr. Goldin said. ''These children have been shuffled from one temporary home to another. Morever indifference has been compounded by bad judgment.''For example the report said the city waited seven months to respond to an adoption request then denied the request because it was more than six months old. The child in that case who came into foster care after being neglected remains with foster parents who have said they will not adopt him.By law the city must respond to adoption requests within 30 days.The report said the city also failed to abide by the 30-day limit in a case involving a child who had not seen her mother in 22 months and who was listed as expected to ''return to parent.'' Although a request to put the child up for adoption was made in August 1987 the city had not responded after nine months. Deprived of AdoptionIn another case a child who was never visited by either parent was still not freed for adoption after almost three years the report said. Had proper procedure been followed the child could have been adopted shortly after his first birthday. Instead the report said ''adoption is still in the remote future.'' The 30-Day Limit

 4622,  1992, a, For Sabah Fakhri the concert he sang on Friday night at Town Hall was a short one only two and a half hours long instead of five hours or more. But there was ample opportunity to savor the passion and subtleties of Mr. Fakhri's performance and of the classical Arab traditions he maintains. It was a concert of vividly expressive singing and protean interplay among Mr. Fakhri a seven-man ensemble and three backup singers.Mr. Fakhri was born in Aleppo Syria and has studied and performed music from across the Arab world; he has become one of the leading Arab classical singers. His specialty is the classical muwashshah a Moorish-derived song based on Arabic poetry dealing with love and philosophical themes from a centuries-old Andalusian tradition that continues in Aleppo and elsewhere.Like other Arab classical music it is a tradition of melody and rhythm without harmony. In Mr. Fakhri's ensemble two violins an oud a qanun (zither) and a cello share and comment on the melodies while the three-man chorus joins in or sings responses. A riq (tambourine) and tablah (hand drum) plus an occasional cello pizzicato propel the rhythm. The music is guided by Mr. Fakhri's singing which sets out the tunes and then rises above them in improvisatory curves and flourishes sometimes in broad arcs sometimes in tight trills and microtonal quavers. When he decides to move into a new section the group responds to his subtlest gestures as if they were reading a written score.The closest Western analogue might be gospel music which stretches to accommodate the soloists' inspirations. But instead of vamping a pattern behind the singer as in gospel the ensemble had to pick up full-length songs at a moment's notice.

 3772,  1997, a, Challenging OrthodoxiesIn an Evening of BeethovenOrchestra of St. LukeCarnegie HallIt takes a combination of conviction and fortitude to offer an all-Beethoven concert at a time when programs devoted wholly to standard repertory are increasingly criticized as unimaginative. Andre Previn tilted at that windmill on Wednesday when he led the Orchestra of St. Luke's in a Beethoven evening. He also challenged another orthodoxy the belief that a composer's instrumentation and sense of scale are sacrosanct. His centerpiece was a string orchestra expansion of the String Quartet No. 14 with basses doubling the cello line and with dynamics and tempos that reflected the ensemble's heft.Tradeoffs were inevitable. A composer writing for a string quartet expects a nimbleness and clarity that it would not be reasonable to expect from an orchestra not only because the move from single to multiple strings courts ensemble problems but also because of the different ways a quartet and an orchestra interact with an acoustic space. The Orchestra of St. Luke's played with extroardinary unity yet there were times particularly in the Presto when a listener craved the sharper focus a quartet affords.Still it was not lost on Mr. Previn that Beethoven's slow movements magnify well and in the Adagio and Andante movements he drew from his players a Stokowskian lushness and grandeur. Earlier Mr. Previn was more circumspect. Except for its punctuating chordal bursts his account of the ''Coriolan'' Overture subordinated drama and electricity to surface sheen. In the Fourth Piano Concerto Mr. Previn and his soloist Horacio Gutierrez presented a refined patrician reading that worked magnificently in the slow movement but elsewhere lacked the provocative edge that makes Beethoven Beethoven.

 5347,  1988, a, The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission has been given a preliminary triple-A rating by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. It is the first United States shelf offering by a Japanese company to be rated.The Japanese company will be issuing bonds totaling 400 billion yen (about $3.2 billion now) over a one-year period. The proceeds will be used to buy property and equipment.Nippon Telegraph was converted from a Government-owned domestic telecommunications monopoly to a private company in April 1985. A recently completed third public offering of 1.5 million shares has reduced the Government's ownership to about 65 percent. The Government is required to own at least one-third of Nippon's outstanding shares.

 4194,  1995, a, A totally new screen design begins with a desktop even less useful than the one on the Mac whose icons folders and document orientation have been "borrowed" lock stock and subdirectory. Desktop icons let you explore files on My Computer and in the Network Neighborhood. You can also click on a Recycle Bin where deleted files are stored until you empty them; a Briefcase which lets you pack files for travel; an electronic Inbox which stores your mail and faxes and unless the Justice Department intervenes the Microsoft Network on-line service.The Start button at the bottom left of the screen launches a list of programs and documents. A Taskbar beside it shows what programs are currently running and is supposed to be visible at all times. But in just one of many maddening inconsistencies multimedia programs often make the Taskbar mysteriously disappear.User interfaces are highly personal. I found this one an improvement over Windows 3.1 but persistently irritating nonetheless. How do you call up a directory of your files? Click My Computer or Windows Explorer which work quite differently from one another. There are many disparate ways to do things as simple as copying a file but none works quite the way you expect it to at least not until you discover the formerly dormant right mouse button. Where is the Shut Down option? On the Start button of course!You get used to these oddities. Windows 95 lets you customize look and feel to a fare-thee-well and adds useful features like a "find" utility which helps track down files across multiple drives and directories. But unlike OS/2 Warp the system can get befuddled if you delete or rename certain files.As noted here on June 20 Windows 95 lets you use long file names like Letter to an Unknown Woman but also truncates them into old-style "8-dot-3" directory entries like LETTER 1.DOC. The ability to use long file names available on the Mac since 1984 is long overdue; unfortunately current application software cannot view or manipulate them and sending them across networks or to DOS or Windows 3.1 systems adds special problems. You cannot avoid them even if you want to: Windows 95 stores many of its own files under the new scheme.Programs like Quicken and Turbotax handle few user-named files. But with most programs the right but costly answer to the long-file-name perplex is to buy new software designed for Windows 95. Upgraded utility software is crucial. Current backup software for example cannot save long file names and the inadequate Windows 95 backup program crashed repeatedly on my system.Early tests of final versions here and in the July 24 issue of PC Week confirm that Windows 95 does not run current programs faster; if anything it tends to slow them down a bit. In actual use pluses and minuses seem randomly mixed. On my system multimedia benchmark programs indicated significantly improved CD-ROM performance but loading Encarta took nearly twice as long as it did before.

 141,  2019, a, Seinfeld Chappelle Haddish Wong : We have plenty of choices when it comes to stand-up comics in the United States. But sit-down comedy as in rakugo a centuries-old form of Japanese comic storytelling — not so much. Katsura Sunshine the star and director of “ Katsura Sunshine’s Rakugo ” at New World Stages  brings the form with buoyant humor and play fulness Off Broadway.The stage is adorned simply with red and white lanterns overhead and a rectangular platform on which Mr. Sunshine kneels for the performance in the traditional style. A typical rakugo performance consists of stories delivered with three parts: an introduction the story proper and the punch line. But when Mr. Sunshine steps onto the stage something about the sight doesn’t quite compute.Starting with the Guy Fieri -style bottle-blond hair.Mr. Sunshine dressed in a kimono and bearing the two traditional props of the form — a fan (sensu) and a hand towel (tenugui) — was born in Toronto and is of Slovenian descent. One may enter fearing the twin terrors of cultural insensitivity and appropriation just to find them unfounded.Because Mr. Sunshine whose given name is Gregory Robic  is no drive-by enthusiast. Early in the show as if anticipating the question of authenticity he speaks of spending two decades in Japan and of his three-year apprenticeship under the rakugo master Katsura Bunshi VI . Now Mr. Sunshine is only the second Westerner to become a rakugo master in Japan’s history.
 2617,  2004, a, Jennifer McLaughlin and Roderick J. Cassidy were married yesterday by Cardinal Edward M. Egan at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. Msgr. James P.

 2824,  2003, a, THERE is something about this time of year with summer gone and fall not yet truly upon us that makes me want to bustle about the kitchen canning and preserving and setting aside all manner of good things for the harsh months ahead.There is however one slight problem: I have no idea how to go about canning. And even if I did know how I don't have the time or the cupboard space to throw myself into heavy-duty preserving. But these seasonal urges toward comforting domestic activity are somehow pleasing all the same and a busy urban life does not necessarily preclude satisfying them. From a purely practical point of view of course there is no call for pickle-preparing or jam-making but that is what makes setting aside time to enjoy this kind of activity a pleasurable luxury. I feel as if I am escaping the confines of my normal life my normal self and that in itself is liberating.Of course it helps that the gentle preserving I go in for -- a mellow pumpkin chutney some pickled fennel an oven-made raspberry jelly -- requires only the minimum of effort. The whole point is that you do not need to be a bona fide stoutly efficient homesteader; you need only have the desire to follow the recipes. This may be gingham cooking for the stainless-steel-kitchen set but unashamedly so.For the unpracticed preserver chutney is perhaps the easiest first step. It requires neither expertise nor frenzied activity. You just put everything in a pan -- in this case chopped pumpkin onions chili peppers sugar pumpkin pie spice ground cloves minced ginger vinegar and some salt -- and let everything bubble away until you have a mellow brown and sticky mixture. The chutney makes itself without much intervention on your part. Once put into sterilized jars (and I often sterilize these by giving them a run through the dishwasher) the chutney keeps well. Indeed it actually gets better with age. Imagine you could bring this stuff out to go with your Thanksgiving turkey. (Just bask in the warm glow that gives you.) To wait that long before eating it would be a shame though. Pair it with a good sharp cheddar or alongside some cold meats with which it is out of this world.

 2096,  2007, a, On paper Hyung-Taik Lee was an unimposing roadblock for Andy Murray. Lee a relatively stocky 31-year-old from South Korea barely plays .500 ball. His career main-tour record coming into his match with Murray the 19th-seeded British No. 1 was 141-141; Murray’s was 81-44.But matches aren’t played on paper. Their match this evening was being played on a hard court and Lee had reason to think he could win. When they met in San Jose earlier this year on a hard court the match went the distance with Murray winning in a third-set tiebreaker.This time on the bigger stage Lee prevailed winning 6-3 6-3 2-6 7-5.Lee started his third-round match tonight by going up two sets to love his brand of unspectacular but steady tennis forcing Murray to come up with something special to win points. More often than not an agitated Murray ended points with unforced errors (Once Murray kicked a trash can after winning a point).But he turned things around in the third set. Murray found the range on his first serve (he finished with 15 aces) while more errors started to creep into Lee’s game.Lee however found his game again in the fourth set. Although he twice requested treatment from a tour trainer for his back he was able to take a 5-2 lead. Murray answered by fighting off match points and rallying to 5-all. He got a little help from Lee who clearly got tight.Lee held to 6-5. Murray needing to hold serve again picked the worst possible time to play a bad game. Lee took advantage breaking Murray again to close out the match.The near loss to Murray in San Jose wasn’t the only reason Lee a baseliner had a real shot at upending Murray. Lee was in fine form having beaten Guillermo Canas in the second round — and all Canas has done this year is beat Roger Federer twice on hard courts. Also potentially working in Lee’s favor was the fact that Murray is returning from a wrist injury.Lee’s workmanlike game — built more on steadiness than booming serves and rocket winners — was at its best against his opponent a 20-year-old baseliner known to mix power with a feathery touch.Now Lee goes to the fourth round matching his best United States Open result.Murray with his coach Brad Gilbert can go regroup.

 3962,  1996, a, Minutes after the State Assembly approved a bill that grants amnesty to delinquent taxpayers Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the measure into law.Under the measure state tax collectors will not impose any late fees fines or interest payments. Officials are counting on the law to add $80 million to the treasury. Governor Whitman has drawn some criticism from Democratic lawmakers for signing a $4 million contract to promote the 90-day amnesty period even before the bill was considered by the State Senate last month.The state raised $183 million in 1987 the only other time it offered amnesty to tax delinquents. The state has not set a starting date for this year's program.

 4178,  1995, a, A tiny South Bronx church's annual basketball tournament has become the unlikely catalyst for a court test of the Giuliani administration's position that condoms should not be handed out in city parks.For two years distribution of free condoms was part of tournament of the All Saints Lutheran Parish in the borough's Mott Haven section.But late last month when the church received its permit for the tournament from the City Parks and Recreation Department there was a handwritten note at the bottom saying that condom distribution was forbidden in all city parks and recreation sites.In response to the church's request for help lawyers from the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit late yesterday afternoon to try to force the city to allow the condoms to be given out. Justice Alice Schlesinger of state Supreme Court in Manhattan granted their request yesterday but state law grants the city an automatic stay from the adhering to the ruling.

 2113,  2007, a, Updated 4:47 p.m. | The New York City public advocate Betsy Gotbaum called this afternoon for an official investigation into the death of her 45-year-old stepdaughter-in-law who died in police custody at the airport in Phoenix on Friday while on her way to Tucson to enter an inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program.In a statement Betsy Gotbaum’s office criticized the Phoenix police’s handling of the case. The statement said Carol Gotbaum had been “manhandled” and mistreated sentiments that the family’s lawyer echoed in an interview.“The family has not reached a conclusion as to whether her care and treatment were inappropriate but the circumstances were highly unusual” Michael C. Manning a lawyer who was hired on Sunday by the Gotbaum family told The New York Times in a phone interview. “This woman — who was 5-foot-7 less than 110 pounds — was without doubt emotionally disturbed and at this stage the family understands why the Phoenix Police Department intervened but it’s what happened after the intervention that causes us concern.”Mr. Manning said that the Maricopa County medical examiner’s office had initially scheduled an autopsy for today but that at his request the office had agreed to delay the autopsy by a day. Mr. Manning also said that he wanted an independent forensic pathologist to be present during the autopsy.According to the Phoenix police Carol Gotbaum became agitated and disruptive at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Friday after missing a 2:58 p.m. U.S. Airways Express flight to Tucson. Sgt. Andy Hill a police spokesman told CNN this morning:We did receive a call that she was very loud – yelling and screaming running around the concourse area. Two officers responded to that location. They contacted Ms. Gotbaum. They could not calm her down. There was probable cause to arrest her for disorderly conduct by disturbing the peace which they did. It was very difficult for them to get her handcuffed but they did not have to pepper-spray or Tase her or anything else.One of the officers then took Ms. Gotbaum to a holding office where about seven other police employees were working Sergeant Hill said. She was placed in a holding room with her hands cuffed behind her back he said.Sergeant Hill said that police procedure calls for checking on detainees at least once every 15 minutes. After Ms. Gotbaum had been in the room 5 to 10 minutes — and stopped screaming — officers who went to check on her found her unconscious with her cuffed hands close to her neck. The officers tried to use an automated external defibrillator and then cardiopulmonary resuscitation to revive her but were not successful. Members of the local Fire Department arrived; they too could not revive her.At 4:03 p.m. Eastern standard time Sergeant Hill issued a statement containing additional details about the death:When Ms. Gotbaum was arrested and handcuffed with her hands behind her back she was taken to the holding office in Terminal 4 and placed in a holding room. There she was searched but was continuing to be vocally and physically disruptive in the holding room. Ms. Gotbaum was additionally restrained as follows: In the holding room there is a bench with an “eyehook” attached to it. The officers took a “shackle” which is described as a metal chain approximately 16 inches long with a large “handcuff” on each side. The total length of the chain with handcuffs is approximately 24 inches. One of the handcuffs on the “shackle” was attached to the “eyehook” on the bench. The other handcuff of the shackle was attached to the chain of the handcuffs that were already on Ms. Gotbaum’s hands. So Ms. Gotbaum was handcuffed with her hands behind her back and additionally those handcuffs were attached to a shackle that kept her attached to the bench. This is the best we can describe the situation at that point. All of the previous information is still the same with the addition of the information of the shackle. We still do not know how Ms. Gotbaum was able to manipulate the handcuffs to the position she was in. But when she was found her handcuffs were in front and the shackle was still attached to her handcuffs. The chain was not wrapped around her neck. It was pulled against the front of her neck area. I hope this helps. Again the Phoenix Police Department is conducting a death investigation. The Medical Examiner’s Office will determine cause and manner of death. And the Phoenix Police Department Professional Standards Bureau is conducting an internal investigation which is standard operating procedure.Paul Skellon a spokesman for Mesa Airlines which operates U.S. Airways Express flights said that Ms. Gotbaum was not denied boarding her flight. She simply arrived too late he said. The door to the gate had already closed the jetway had disengaged from the plane and the plane was about to push back he said.Mr. Manning said that Ms. Gotbaum was in the Phoenix airport for what was to have been a brief layover on her way to Tucson where she planned to enter an alcoholism treatment program. He said he did not know how long she had had a drinking problem.The Daily News today quoted unidentified airport workers as saying that Ms. Gotbaum screamed “I’m not a terrorist!” and struggled with security officers as she was subdued.According to Sergeant Hill the police are investigating the circumstances of the death as is the Maricopa County medical examiner’s office which covers Phoenix.Ms. Gotbaum a mother of three lived on the Upper West Side. Her husband is Noah E. Gotbaum an investor who has worked in Eastern Europe. They married on June 10 1995 at a ceremony in Central Park.According to the couple’s wedding announcement published in The Times Ms. Gotbaum was a daughter of Cmdr. and Mrs. Henry B. Stiger of Cape Town South Africa. At the time Ms. Gotbaum was a senior buyer in London for the House of Frasier a department store company. She received an M.B.A. from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Her father retired as the commander of the South African Navy Diving School in Simonstown. Her previous marriage had ended in divorce.Mr. Gotbaum was a director of the Central Europe Trust Company a consulting and investment firm in London. He graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1977 and from Amherst College in 1981 and he received a master’s degree in public policy management from Yale University in 1989.Mr. Gotbaum is the son of Victor Gotbaum who for many years was executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees the city’s largest alliance of public sector unions and his former wife Dr. Sarah C. Gotbaum. Victor and Sarah Gotbaum divorced in the early 1970s.Betsy Gotbaum married Victor Gotbaum in 1976. Betsy Gotbaum has been the city’s parks commissioner and the president of the New-York Historical Society. In 2001 she was elected public advocate; she was re-elected in 2005. As the city’s second-highest-ranking official the public advocate is first in line to be mayor if the mayor should die or become incapacitated.Betsy Gotbaum told reporters in a statement outside her Central Park West home on Sunday:This is a horrible tragedy for my family for my stepson and my three grandchildren. Carol was a wonderful person. She was a wonderful mother. She was sweet and kind and loving. At this moment we are awaiting the results of the investigation. We don’t know any more than what has been reported in the press. This is obviously very very difficult for us. We are dealing with it as best we can. My No. 1 focus is those children and my stepson. And I hope the press will consider our feelings and please please please don’t ask us any more questions. We made the statement. We will let you know as soon as we can. Thank you.Ms. Gotbaum’s office released a further statement this afternoon:We are not jumping to any conclusions but the circumstances surrounding Carol’s death appear to be unusual enough to raise serious questions and warrant a thorough investigation. Carol who was only five foot seven and one-hundred and five pounds appears to have been manhandled by the Phoenix Police Department. She was a loving and devoted mother of three children under the age of nine who was on her way to an alcohol rehabilitation facility to seek treatment for herself. She cried out for help at the airport but her pleas appear to have been met by mistreatment.A woman who answered the telephone at a home of Carol Gotbaum’s relatives in Cape Town said the family did not wish to discuss the death. “This is a private family matter” the woman said.Lawrence Kobilinsky an expert in forensic science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice said that any number of factors might cause a person to die very quickly including a heart attack a cardiac arrhythmia or an aneurysm. Any death investigator would also examine whether drugs — prescription medications or illegal narcotics — were in the person’s system. Overdoses of methamphetamines and cocaine among other illicit drugs can be life-threatening.Dr. Howard C. Adelman an independent forensic pathologist and a former chief deputy medical examiner in Suffolk County said there have been cases in which police officers in subduing a suspect have placed pressure on the person’s chest constraining the ability to breathe. Similarly there have been cases where people have been restrained hogtied or handcuffed in an unusual position causing them to asphyxiate. In a situation known as excited delirium a person begins to act in a highly agitated state. That can lead to the release of adrenaline which in turn could cause a cardiac arrhythmia.Both experts emphasized that they were speaking about general possibilities and that an autopsy would have to be conducted to determine the cause of death.John Holusha John Sullivan and Mathew R. Warren contributed reporting. Sandra Jamison contributed research.

 3130,  2001, a, Ever since a knife-wielding man killed eight children at an elementary school near Osaka on June 8 schools across Japan have wasted little time adopting security measures that until the stabbing would have been unthinkable in a country of little violence.School officials have locked gates posted guards organized parent patrols installed cameras and enrolled teachers in self-defense courses.Some schools are even arming teachers with weapons like ear-splitting noise alarms long Y-shaped poles (often used by the police to subdue suspects) and canisters of tear gas.Hideki Matsuzaki the mayor of Urayasu a town east of Tokyo said ''It might look dangerous for schools to have such devices but what should not have happened did actually happen in Ikeda and the city government should consider concrete measures to keep children safe.'' Urayasu plans to distribute tear-gas canisters to 42 schools.
 2558,  2004, a, India's economy soared 10.4 percent in the final quarter of 2003 making it one of the fastest growing in the world even ahead of China.The last quarter's rise up from an 8.4 percent pace in the previous quarter was driven mainly by an expansion of nearly 17 percent in farm output. Last season the country benefited from the heaviest monsoon rains in over a decade. Farming accounts for a quarter of India's economy.The Center for Monitoring of the Indian Economy based in Mumbai said in its monthly review released Wednesday that overall gross domestic product earlier forecast at around 8 percent would probably be above 9 percent in the government's fiscal year ending this month.But the jump which makes India the fastest-growing Asian economy is unlikely to continue.''I would not get too excited about the double digits because there is a big skew in farm output this year which is unlikely to repeat'' said Jyotivardhan Jaipuria head of research at DSP Merrill Lynch.

 4692,  1992, a, To the Editor: Betsy Wade's article "In Trip Insurance Small Print Is No Small Matter" (Oct. 11) brought to light problems faced by the traveler as well as by the travel agent. Among the cases Ms. Wade cited was the problem faced by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Kammerer long-time clients of my agency Travel Headquarters of Short Hills N.J. When Mr. Kammerer fell ill he could not get compensation for the cost of the cruise the couple was not able to take on Pearl Cruises because the trip-cancellation coverage ceased when they began their trip.The article did not report that Pearl Cruises' insurance policy arrived less than 10 days before the Kammerers' departure. This was past the deadline for purchase of a Chubb policy called Travelsafe that our agency always recommends to tour and cruise clients if the operator's policy is not broad enough. Travelsafe covers for trip cancellation interruption and delay and remains in force for the duration of the trip. ELIZABETH L. KOCH Short Hills N.J.

 5005,  1990, a, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will introduce on Monday a microprocessor chip that incorporates almost all of the components of the circuit board used in the original PC-AT personal computer.The announcement is the first of several expected in the coming months of superchips that are expected to allow notebook-size personal computers to shrink even further.In early personal computers the microprocessor which serves as the brain was surrounded by dozens of other chips that performed ancillary functions like helping the microprocessor interact with other parts of the computer. In recent years companies led by Chips and Technologies Inc. have developed so-called chip sets which consolidate these functions into a handful of chips.But as the number of transistors that can be put on a single piece of silicon continues to grow it is becoming possible to build the ancillary functions into the microprocessor itself. Advanced Micro's new chip contains all the electronics for a personal computer except the memory and a few specialized chips like one for drawing images on the screen.

 4043,  1996, a, To the EditorSeveral issues have not been raised in news articles on public financing of private or religious schools (''Ohio Paying Some Tuition for Religious School Students'' and ''Saying No to Private Schools at Public Expense'' Education page Aug. 28).Public financing is intended to educate the children of the public-at-large not merely those successful enough to gain entrance and remain.Private and religious schools pick and choose among students. Every year we in the public school system deal with dozens of former religious and private school students seeking placement; the reasons they and their parents give are illustrative. ''I couldn't pay the tuition any more'' or ''they told my son he had to pass all his courses or they'd put him out'' or ''he kept getting into trouble.''It takes savvy parents to get their students into private or religious schools voucher or no voucher. And students of such parents typically do well regardless of where they go to school. Is it any wonder that such children do better than those students simply sent off alone to wander into their neighborhood schools?

 5082,  1989, a, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia wound up a visit to Egypt today by saying he would support Egypt's return to the Arab League. Cairo was expelled 10 years ago for making peace with Israel.On the eve of the departure to Washington of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt for talks on Monday with President Bush Mr. Mubarak has won the backing of the Saudis the Jordanians and Palestine Liberation Organization all of whom agree with the need to urge Washington to back an international peace conference on the Middle East.After several days of talks with Mr. Mubarak King Fahd's widely forecast endorsement of Egypt's return to the official Arab fold was interpreted here as an acknowledgment of Egypt's revived role in the Arab world after 10 years of ostracism because of its peace with Israel.''The Saudi side said that Egypt's presence within the Arab fold was indispensable support for joint concrete Arab work which would strengthen Arab solidarity in achieving the rights of the Arab nation'' a joint Saudi-Egyptian statement said today according to reports monitored here.

 3605,  1998, a, To the Editor:It's depressing to learn that young editors at our top publishers are thinking like the trash tabloids (Buzz: ''Fantasies of Monica Lewinsky: The Book'' Feb. 8). These people will soon be deciding which books get published and which will not make it. On what grounds?Not long ago book publishing attracted graduates who were educated enough to find and promote fine authors and exciting ideas. They were willing to work for less than they could make elsewhere because they had a vision of publishing's importance to society.The Radcliffe Publishing Course graduates would surely smile at such notions as dinosaur behavior that vanished along with standards of quality and integrity. Today as one said: ''There has to be dirt or forget it. No dirt no cash.''SUZANNE KISTLERKips Bay

 5521,  1986, a, Brad Daugherty a senior guard scored 19 points and North Carolina posted a record fourth straight 100-point game to beat Florida State 109-64 in college basketball tonight.The Tar Heels (13-0) grabbed a 52-25 halftime lead and never looked back as they reached the 100-point mark for the seventh time this season.It was the first time in the school's 74-year basketball history that the Tar Heels had four consecutive 100-point games.North Carolina which led by as many as 47 points in the second half took the lead for good at 12-10 on a layup by Jeff Lebo with 14 minutes 6 seconds left in the first half. The Tar Heels hit 60 percent from the field and the Seminoles connected on only 37.9 percent.
 5435,  1987, a, As if in ascent from his river lounge Raja jutted one of his tusks wet and grand from the water and he huffed the blowzy wet sigh of a defiant champion between rounds. But he stayed resting in the mud idle as the state pensioner he has been for the last 20 years. This nine-foot-high creature is the official national treasure of Sri Lanka and he obviously knows it. As the time for the annual procession approaches concern has grown that he might finally have to be replaced by one of two younger understudies who have been swaggering ambitiously for some time.There is the 45-year-old upstart Raja the Younger who always has a near-lead position in the glittering Tooth Relic procession. He is a local favorite because his tusks seem slightly longer if not more exquisite than the Elder's a considerable factor since only one in 20 Sri Lankan elephants have tusks. And there is the gifted alien Vijayaraja rock-star young at 11 years and imported from Thailand as the official understudy. But he is rushing now to learn the Sinhalese words for the 24 basic elephant commands. These go far beyond simple forward and reverse to graceful sidesteps ear flappings and trunk manipulations that bear out the islanders' conviction that their elephants are paragons of intelligence and grace. Relic Doubted by SomeSome doubt after centuries of plunder and desecration that the casket really contains the sacred tooth said to have been retrieved from the cremation of Buddha in India. Leonard Woolf the colonial official and husband of Virginia claimed to have seen the relic 75 years ago concluding it was not human but ''a canine tooth about three inches and curved.''This is denied as the relic has long been venerated here at the Dalada Maligawa the Temple of the Tooth a rallying point for Sri Lanka across centuries of subjugation.The casket is kept closed and the parade is an annual reaffirmation of national spirit. In this Raja who has received elephantine doses of rheumatism medicines cannot be seen to be flagging in his regal bearing.
 5792,  1985, a, Harris County Tex. and the Port of Houston Authority situated in that county are revamping their finances with a new $618 million bond issue that will be used to refund all their previously issued bonds.Tentative interest rates on the new bonds were announced yesterday by underwriters led by Kidder Peabody & Company. For unlimited tax bonds yields ranged from 5.60 percent for bonds due in 1986 to 7.40 percent in 1990 8.60 percent in 1995 9.20 percent in 2000 and 9.50 percent in 2006. Yields were higher by one-tenth of a percentage point for a companion issue of limited tax bonds.Although all the bonds are rated triple A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation the financing is divided into limited and unlimited tax bonds. The unlimited tax bonds are backed by the ability of the county and the port authority to levy property taxes without limit while the limited tax bonds are backed by the county's ability to levy a property tax up to 30 cents per $100 of market value. The limited tax bonds have a higher yield because in theory they are less secure than the unlimited tax bonds.Despite the difference between the two kinds of bonds the limited tax issue was assigned the highest triple A rating because the county's financial condition is strong and because its tax levy of about 5 1/2 cents per $100 of market value in 1984 was far below the legal limit.

 584,  2015, a, To the Editor:Re “Selling Prints. Printing Money.” (Feb. 22) about the photographer Peter Lik:Is there a point at which the commercial aspects of the careers of Peter Lik and other contemporary artists such as Damien Hirst intersect? They certainly overlap.No one can deny Mr. Lik the right to call his product “art.” As long as his merchandising stops short of outright fraud he can claim a world championship in art-world chutzpah.Dr. Robert JaffeCarpinteria Calif. Feb. 23To the Editor:Thank you for the article about Peter Lik. It seems his only meaningful relationship is with his camera. Yes his photos are beautiful but so are those of hundreds of other photographers.Lucky for him there are plenty of suckers who will pay $50000 or more for an image that is identical to the image earlier in the series that sold for $5000.
 3333,  2000, a, And in Ms. Richardson's third-grade class Jelahn Wilson 8 said the summer was ''not very long but it seemed fun.''''I went on a trip to the Big Apple to see 'Beauty and the Beast' and a trip to Funtime America'' his essay began then veered suddenly into the future tense to make up for the paucity of material. ''But next summer I think I am going to go to Jamaica with my grandmother because she needs help and. . . . ''Under provisions of the state law that authorized New Jersey's publicly financed charter schools the 46 such schools now in operation have more flexibility in programming structure setting and curriculum than other public schools. And three years ago when the founders of Robert Treat Academy looked at the traditional school calendar they saw a holdover from an agrarian time that had little to do with urban America and even less to do with the needs of Newark's children.''We found out that we needed 25 percent more time in the day and so we run from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.'' said Stephen N. Adubato one of the guiding forces behind the academy's creation and the executive director of the North Ward Center a publicly financed social services agency in this mostly Italian and Hispanic neighborhood. ''And we found that we didn't need to have the kids out there hanging out in these dirty streets. They need structure and this charter school is a lab with a license to innovate and test those things.''Experts on the charter school movement as well as those involved in the public debates over the extended school year suggest that longer school days and years are unlikely to catch on at other public schools. For one thing many charter schools are viewed as elitist and as hostile competitors with other public schools for the best students. And the scheduling flexibility the charter schools enjoy reflects their freedom from the contract requirements and benefits that teachers' unions have worked hard to achieve and protect. (The unions and the New Jersey Department of Education have agreed to let the Legislature approve such flexibility as long as the number of charter schools is limited.)

 3969,  1996, a, A little-noted amendment to the farm bill approved by the Congress last week is causing an uproar among consumer groups and even some producers of meat and poultry. But the framers of the amendment Republican staff members of the House Agriculture Committee say they cannot understand what all the furor is about.The amendment creates a Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection Panel with broad powers to review the decisions by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service on such matters as inspection procedures food safety standards and practices in meat and poultry plants as well as work rules and labor relations.Backers say the review panel would improve food safety by requiring more scientists to be involved in the decisions. Opponents say the panel's mandate will be too comprehensive. "We would grind to a halt" said Mike Taylor Acting Under Secretary for Food Safety and Inspection Services. "An incredible array of almost all the decisions we make would be put through this committee."The creation of the panel comes at a time when the Agriculture Department is about to replace the current system of visual inspections of meat and poultry with a more scientific approach that includes microbial testing and performance standards. While the industry does not agree with all provisions of the new system called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point most in the industry are eager for it to begin.

 4903,  1990, a, One chamber of Wisconsin's Legislature approved a bill early today requiring minors to get parental consent before having abortions and defeated an effort to repeal a law that penalizes doctors who perform abortions.''This is going to be a shot heard around the world'' said State Representative Robert Welch a Republican. ''Wisconsin is a liberal state taking a moderate stand on abortion.''The State Assembly the Legislature's lower house had sifted through 30 proposed amendments before its 72-to-24 vote early today for a bill that would require girls under the age of 18 to have the consent of at least one parent or a court. Consent would not be required in cases involving victims of incest or rape. The measure now goes to the Senate.'Pro-Life Isn't Dead'''We're elated'' said Barbara Lyons executive director of the Wisconsin Right to Life organization. ''I think it deflates all the rhetoric that the pro-choice movement was sweeping the country. Pro-life isn't dead; it's alive.''

 4720,  1991, a, When Peruvian guerrillas take one of Tess's colleagues hostage young Melody Shepherd arrives in Washington from a small affiliate station. Melody says she is the hostage's niece. Although someone mentions that the captured man never said over some 20 years anything about having a niece good old Tess takes the novice under her wing even inviting her home until she can find an apartment. Melody's working technique is disarmingly simple: "A bit of promise. A lot of suggestion."It takes the usually astute Tess an incredibly long time to figure out what's going on but she begins to get the picture as Melody seduces not only her son Andrew (David James Elliott) but also her New York boss Brad (Jed Allen) who decides -- shades of a certain morning news show -- that early viewers might appreciate a younger woman all blond and perky while getting ready for work. Finally Tess catches Melody going through her personal computer files. That's it."We may be working on the same story" Tess says "but my work is my work and your work is whatever I tell you to do."Melody is anything but subtle. Surveying Washington at night she gushes about "the sheer power of this town: like an aphrodisiac" (the movie's original title was "Potomac Fever"). Meanwhile Tess has been having mostly by long distance an intense affair with Peter (Stuart Wilson) an English foreign correspondent who wants her to give up everything and run off with him to Spain. This leads to endless discussions on the nature of love. She: "But I love you." He: "And I love you. Therein lies the tragedy." (Presumably the British can get away with lines like that.)And in the end "Her Wicked Ways" is thoroughly dishonest preoccupied only with giving the mass audience what it supposedly craves -- an upbeat ending. Bette Davis may have allowed herself to be bested by the unstoppable Eve but this is the world of television stars and Barbara Eden is not about to take second place to any Melody Shepherd. Tess gets not just her revenge but also the anchor job and Peter who in case you missed the point says "Your life is damn near perfect isn't it?"
 474,  2016, a, WASHINGTON — Thousands of immigrants with criminal convictions including for assault and attempted murder have been released from detention because their native countries refused to take them back according to statistics recently released by the Department of Homeland Security.The inability to deport the criminals has prompted outrage among lawmakers and advocates of tighter immigration laws who say that the Obama administration could be doing much more to pressure uncooperative countries.But the department faces a number of obstacles. It is legally barred from indefinitely detaining immigrants who cannot be repatriated. And poorer nations are often reluctant to take back violent offenders because they have limited resources to deal with them.The release of such immigrants into American cities is a particularly charged aspect of the national debate over immigration. Donald J. Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has painted a grim picture of immigrant criminals menacing the streets.

 435,  2016, a, Gov. John Kasich is no fan of Senator Ted Cruz but he does not want his allies borrowing one of Donald J. Trump’s go-to insults.Mr. Kasich on Friday called on a “super PAC” supporting him to take down an advertisement describing Mr. Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” a nickname for the Texas senator favored by Mr. Trump.The commercial released by New Day for America depicts Mr. Cruz with a Pinocchio-like nose growing and wrapping around his neck.Among other things it refers to an ad by a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz that inaccurately asserted that the liberal billionaire George Soros had provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Mr. Kasich.“If Ted Cruz’s mouth is moving he’s lying” the ad concludes.On the campaign trail Mr. Kasich boasts about how he avoids personal attacks. Speaking to reporters in Pennsylvania on Friday he said he had expressed his displeasure with how Mr. Cruz was described in the ad. (Top Kasich aides used the same nickname “Lyin’ Ted” in Twitter posts this week which Mr. Kasich also found objectionable.)“I would hope that they will not use that word and they’ll take it down” Mr. Kasich said of the commercial.At the same time Mr. Kasich displayed no affection for Mr. Cruz or his allies bringing up a Wall Street Journal editorial that described the Soros ad as a “smear.”“The problem with Senator Cruz is he has no record” Mr. Kasich added. “His record is shutting down the government and making everybody he works with upset.”Super PACs which can accept unlimited donations are not allowed to coordinate with candidates’ campaigns and this is not the first time Mr. Kasich or his team has criticized an ad from the super PAC supporting his run. Before the New Hampshire primary the Kasich campaign called on the super PAC to pull an ad that went after Senator Marco Rubio of Florida; the group obliged.PhotoAsked about Mr. Kasich’s comments Connie Wehrkamp a spokeswoman for the super PAC responded by expressing displeasure about the Soros commercial.“We stand by our ad and the fact that what Ted Cruz’s PAC ran was completely false” she said. “We will always call out our opponents if and when they do that but we are going to review the language we used.”
 6295,  1971, a, Peace Day UrgedThe Pontiff recalled that he had urged world leaders three years ago to join in the church celebration of Jan. 1 as an an nual peace day. Pope Paul did not mention the Vatican's ad herence to the international treaty. A Vatican comment is sued with the official statement described the treaty as a “con dition for general disarma ment.”The Vatican disclosed that it had consulted various govern ments on the matter and that it would set a date for the signing ceremony in agreement with the three Governments that are sponsors of the treaty. They are the United States Britain and the Soviet Union. This was taken to mean that formal diplomatic exchanges would take place also between the Papacy and the Soviet Gov ernment. Although the Vatican and the Kremlin have no offi cial ties informal contacts have occurred lately. Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko paid a call on Pope Paul in November.The treaty of 1968 on halting the spread of nuclear Weapons was ratified by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1969 and came into force on March 5 1970. The Vatican as a sovereign state has become a signatory of several interna tional treaties and agreements in the past.At noon today the Pontiff praised the commutation of the death sentences recently im posed by courts in Burgas and Leningrad as contributions to world peace.Praises DecisionsAddressing a crowd in St. Peter's Square from a window of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace the Pontiff said: “We are starting the new year by the grace of God with the comforting thought of the two acts of clemency that have con cluded two senational trials.”
 3178,  2001, a, The early estimates prepared by the members of Congress involved in the fund's creation are they admit preliminary. But they agreed that the fund was structured to compensate families roughly in line with what they might expect from a court award. In cases of death and severe injury such awards routinely exceed $1 million. ''Those kinds of numbers were clearly being contemplated'' said one official involved in the negotiations.The fund's framers said their aim was to offer families an avenue for relief that would be faster and more certain than litigation. But the concerns already raised about how it will operate and whom it will serve suggest it may need refining.The emerging questions and unhappiness about the fund were in effect born in compromises made to achieve its passage according to interviews with a half-dozen Republican and Democratic participants in the process.The basic architecture of the fund was designed in less than 24 hours with the final passages written at 4 a.m. on Friday Sept. 21 just hours before the measure was passed by both chambers. Negotiators for both parties said the rush was driven by the demands of airline executives who had bluntly warned that they would be out of business without immediate financial aid and protection from lawsuits.Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt had made it clear that there would be no deal for the airlines without compensation for victims. But a disagreement about how best to construct such a system of compensation surfaced.A plan proposed by the White House would have had all victim claims consolidated for trial in federal court in Manhattan with the government stepping in to pay claims only after the airlines' insurance was exhausted. If victims failed to prove who was to blame for their losses they would get nothing.Ultimately though the real wrangling over the nature of the fund took place when leaders of the Senate and House met in the offices of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert on the night of Sept. 20.

That belief is largely responsible for the contempt in which the C.I.A. holds Congress and the conviction that anything goes including evading the law and the Constitution.Opening the C.I.A. to public inspection -- or at least Congressional inspection -- is critical. And openness begins with the budget. The intelligence budget unlike all other budgets is largely secret. This allows the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies to escape public justification for what they're doing. Mr. Woolsey can begin by publishing the budget -- attaching real numbers to specific agencies and broad functions.The overall intelligence budget -- which includes the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency -- is an estimated $29 billion. It may be more. Either way it's excessive. The resources devoted to the Soviet problem dropped from half the 1990 budget to slightly more than a third for the coming year. But the overall budget has been reduced by just a fraction. Surely other intelligence requirements cannot absorb the remaining billions.Many career officers insist that deeper cuts will leave America deaf and blind. Yet money isn't the problem; the C.I.A. was rolling in money when it failed to predict the revolution in Iran and grossly overestimated the strength of the Soviet economy and later the strength of the Iraqi Army.The real problem lies in the way the C.I.A. has traditionally concocted its intelligence assessments. These are inevitably a product of a committee of bureaucrats with vested interests in their programs budgets and pet theories with ears attuned to what top officials want to hear. What emerges is often mush.
 1906,  2008, a, The Queens Library issued a news release on Friday morning boasting that yet again it had the highest circulation last year of any public library system in the United States.The Public Library Data Service Statistical Report issued by the American Library Association found that the Queens Library lent 21033861 items in the fiscal year that ended on June 30 2007. The Multnomah County Public Library in Oregon which includes Portland was No. 2 with 19589530 loans.The Queens Library system has been No. 1 in the national ranking many times before — including last year — so this latest news was no surprise. But this passage in the Queens Library’s news release was eye-catching:Public library usage is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months. Traditionally people turn to public libraries during hard economic times for free entertainment free after-school child care to help with employment for free access to the public use computers and to help them save money by doing things themselves such as home and auto repairs. Queens Library saw a 16 percent jump in circulation and attendance immediately following Sept. 11 for instance.After the last recession in the United States in 2001 the American Library Association reported that library usage had risen sharply and that 91 percent of adults believed libraries would play an important role in the future even with the information revolution accompanying the rise of the Internet. There have not been any national studies yet on whether the current economic downturn has influenced library patronage.The Queens Library said that its circulation for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 was 22.8 million — another record — but comparisons with other library systems for the 2008 fiscal year won’t be available until next year.Although Queens is only the second most populous borough its library circulation has traditionally far surpassed that of New York City’s two other library systems the Brooklyn Public Library and the New York Public Library which also runs circulating libraries in Manhattan the Bronx and Staten Island. Those two systems circulate about 16 million items a year.A report last year by the city’s Independent Budget Office suggested that city financing be adjusted. Though the three library systems receive city money in proportion to their populations city financial support per library visit is considerably lower in Queens than for the other two systems because of the high circulation in Queens.

 284,  2017, a, We have seen all of this before employed by the K.G.B. and the East German Stasi: psychological warfare rumor-mongering schemes to bribe politicians and then expose them as criminals. They used it both internally against dissidents and externally against Western enemies. Mr. Putin and his former K.G.B. colleagues should know that this time we have a better sense of their dirty tricks and how they have updated Zersetzung for the internet.The government has its role to play but so do journalists and civil-society groups. We journalists will put pressure on companies like Facebook and Twitter to be vigilant against fake news; we will expose the patterns of Russian agitprop where we see them.But it is just as important to be clear about the ideology driving these attacks. In September my newspaper Die Zeit joined with the broadcaster ZDF to reveal details of Moscow’s highly sophisticated disinformation campaign. We had gained access to roughly 10000 emails that showed how ideologues close to the Putin administration advised the pro-Russian rebel government in Eastern Ukraine.Among the emails was a document that set “thematic guidelines” which rebel-allied media outlets had to follow — if necessary by distorting facts and faking news. “Today’s Russia is no longer the Russia of the 1990s but is working unwaveringly to re-establish the strength of the Soviet Union. Today’s Russia is on an equal footing with the West” it read. “A global diplomatic war is underway. But the West is also suffering in this war and it is still unclear who will prevail.”No doubt similar marching orders have been given to the armies of hackers who were sent to attack the Democrats and who are now plotting attacks on Germany.It is quite clear who will lose. Mr. Putin and his reckless fakers should be aware that the only thing they will harvest from this mendacity is another lost generation of Russians who could serve their country better by being given the opportunity for honest and constructive intellectual challenges. A government that maligns the outside world to make feel Russia great again is doomed to fail — as it failed before.

 1399,  2011, a, What a difference four years make.In the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination the candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee seemed to take every chance to disparage each another. Each took potshots at the other’s stands on the issues and their track records. Once Mr. Romney even criticized Mr. Huckabee who upended Mr. Romney’s plans to win the Iowa caucuses with a surprise victory for his diction.But on Saturday night when Mr. Huckabee now a Fox News host interviewed his former rival on his show about Mr. Romney’s 2012 campaign things were different. They sat smiling and occasionally offering compliments. They were polite.For some perspective here is a representative television appearance by the two from 2008 campaign. (The captions are not by The New York Times.)On Saturday Mr. Huckabee who is not running for president this year said to his guest that many viewers had tuned in wondering “Would you and I be able to sit in the same room and be civil to each other?”“I think we’ve proven that people can be civil.”And that was perhaps because Mr. Huckabee seemed to pull some of the punches that might have been irresistible four years ago.At one point Mr. Romney replied to an abortion-rights question by saying he believed that life began at conception and he spoke of his desire to see the United States Supreme Court’s landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade overturned. Immediately afterward he seemed to draw less of a hard line saying he would leave the decision to permit the procedure up to the states.In response Mr. Huckabee likened that approach to the conditions in the country before the Civil War but he just as quickly abandoned that idea.Four years ago Mr. Huckabee who opposes abortion rights frequently used Mr. Romney’s less-stringent stance as ammunition and framed Mr. Romney’s view as “flip-flopping.”But there were smiles and cordiality on Saturday night. Mr. Romney even asked Mr. Huckabee a former governor of Arkansas why he had not entered the fray this year. (His response was that he could not run and also continue his television show.) Mr. Romney went so far as to say it would have been “terrific” if Mr. Huckabee had once again run.

The new multinational force to be led by Brazil is to take over on June 1. Despite a request from Secretary General Kofi Annan to give the force a two-year mandate the Council decided to review the mission after six months.

 6062,  1977, a, One section of the bill whose effects were uncovered yesterday would increase in some circumstances the pensions of officials who remained in office after the age of 70. It would do this by in effect freezing the money reserves on which the pension was based when the employee became 70 rather than letting it continue to decline as was now the case.This is the section that could in theory affect Mr. Levitt and Mr. Lefkowitz if they retired and selected certain pension options. Both men denied having encouraged the measure or having any knowledge of it and said it had no relevance because they had no current plans to retire.Its primary beneficiaries according to sources would be a number of judges who routinely remain in their posts after the age of 70. Precisely how many would be affected by the change and how much such a change would cost could not be ascertained yesterday.Another section would in essence allow the New York City Conciliation and Appeals Board—the hearing officers for disputes involving the city's rent‐stablilization system — to be classified as a municipality giving its employees the right to join the state's employee‐retirement system.This provision would allow Mr. Gribetz who served on the board for four years to take that additional credit for state service which would have some effect on his eventual pension. Mr. Gribetz said yesterday that he was unaware of the measure until the time it was introduced and criticized the way it was done.“I didn't ask for it and I didn't know about it” Mr. Gribetz said. “If they want to add these people to the retirement system it ought to be done openly not within a salary bill.”He said the provision would affect about 100 people other than himself and that many of them were not currently covered by any pension plan.

 5083,  1989, a, Ted Shaker executive producer for sports at CBS saw the Schembechler clip on ESPN Saturday night and assigned aides to get permission to use it Sunday. ESPN confirmed that CBS got permission from ESPN but admits it should not have given it. ESPN had the tape because WXYZ had transmitted it to Detroit from Kentucky through ESPN equipment. Giving Due Credit''Channel 7 in Detroit was putting a hold on it but they inadvertently forgot to tell us that'' said Mike Bogad ESPN's assignment-desk manager.Shaker said credit was given to WXYZ at the end of the CBS basketball telecast Sunday. That was about the time Bob Lipson was leaving Charleston S.C. to fly home to Detroit after attending a bar mitzvah.Lipson president of CTC Sports Inc. in West Bloomfield Mich. produces Schembechler's television show on WXYZ and makes videotapes Michigan uses in recruiting.He saw the Schembechler clip on CBS at the airport and called CBS to get permission to use it. When he landed he learned that the tape was already his property. Under an agreement among WXYZ CTC Sports and Schembechler WXYZ sends a cameraman into the locker room after Michigan's football and basketball games to tape for CTC.WXYZ can use portions of CTC's tapes but only with permission of Lipson. WXYZ did not get such permission last weekend Lipson said.''It's our video not WXYZ's not CBS's not ESPN's'' Lipson said.Lipson said he would probably have allowed the clip to air on WXYZ but not on ESPN or CBS. The WXYZ sports producer John Cwikla said today that one of Lipson's assistants had given WXYZ permission.

 1837,  2008, a, As a special treat for readers of The Moment the power gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin writes about new exhibitions in Paris.Yesterday night was the opening of the “La Louvre – Paris” exhibition by Gelitin the four-man art collective at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (ARC). The Museum was packed. A fashiony and artsy crowd was hanging out at the entrance and inside the museum.The group known as Gelitin from Vienna took over an entire floor of the museum. They filled the space that the museum gave them with more than 3000 artworks from big installations to small pieces exhibited from the floor to ceiling. Broken walls toilets photographs of men half naked piles of chairs pipes stuffed animals real birds — this is the world of Gelitin. A whole room is filled with paintings made with modeling clay: a re-visitation of masterpieces referencing Paris: La Joconde (Leonardo da Vinci) etc. See above.A large band of artistic friends took part in the creation of some works. After being overwhelmed by the vision of all these works (paintings sculptures installation drawings knitting works photos.) I started to detect the smell of caramel and cheese which were used to make some of the works on display. Cheese like caramel was coated on to a sculpture: the smell was very strong as the room was getting warmer and full of visitors.The world of Gelitin could be defined as an enormous extravagant chaotic and proliferating universe. It is difficult to describe the work with a few adjectives. I am very enthusiastic with this exhibition and its dynamic colorful unpredictable and unique in its style. I was leaving the museum while a band was performing in front of an extravagant and flamboyant crowd.“La Louvre – Paris” Musée de la ville de Paris exhibition on view from March 1st to April 20th 2008.

Azarenka an 18-year-old who has lived in Scottsdale Ariz. for two years shrieked in joy after Hingis the 1997 champion here had netted a volley to complete her loss.The 26-year-old Hingis who was in semi-retirement from 2002 until 2006 knew before going on Armstrong that No. 2 Maria Sharapova and No. 7 Nadia Petrova both on her side of the draw had already lost. She had a chance to at least reach to the quarters if not the final.Instead kids like Azarenka Agnieszka Radwanska who defeated Sharpova and now Tamira Paszek are moving on.No. 11 Patty Schnyder fell to Paszek of Austria 4-6 6-4 7-6 (1).

 3715,  1998, a, EH what's up Doc?Jigsaw puzzles -- Looney Tunes Cosmic Capers Animated Jigsaws a puzzle collection culled from the intergalactic travels of Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck Porky Pig and Marvin the Martian. Snap the puzzle pieces together and the image becomes an animated cartoon from the Warner Brothers vaults. Seeing ''Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century'' fragmented reconstituted and animated on a computer monitor one realizes that a bunch of deranged 40-something cartoon characters are the vanguard of convergence.But then we already knew that.As with any toy transported from the physical world to the computer screen there is the question of whether a digital interface adds anything to the experience. In this case it does. Putting together a jigsaw puzzle particularly the cardboard variety is an abstract undertaking. It's about memory and spatial perception and pattern recognition. You sort things by color find the corners assemble the edges put together the obvious clusters then fill in the gaps. When you snap two pieces together the primary payoff is the ''aha'' realization that they fit followed by a tactile sense of completion when you mash them together with your thumb.The virtual version elicits the same puzzle-assembly behavior. (Those sorting strategies are so universal and instinctual one half-suspects that a jigsaw gene is lurking somewhere in the cipher of human DNA.) The ''aha'' moment is identical. Instead of tactile feedback there's a sound effect to punctuate the moment when pieces lock together. Essentially it's the same kind of payoff -- some sensory reassurance that the pieces fit a validation of your insight. In digital translation a jigsaw puzzle doesn't lose much.And it gains a lot. For one thing it's replayable. Unlike the cardboard image which loses all attraction once it is assembled the digital image can be recast as a different puzzle (or displayed as computer wallpaper). There are 48 different patterns from conventional cut-out shapes to square and round configurations which are surprisingly difficult because they lack the usual interlocking puzzle parts. This game makes you realize how much ''pure logic'' really comes down to habit.

Where is the “second African genocide” taking place?d. Who is Ruth Wedgwood?e. What concern does Ms. Wedgwood have regarding Mr. Kerry’s statements regarding the International Criminal Court?f. What was bombed in 1998?g. What obstacle prevented Saddam Hussein from instating a long-range missile project?h. Who is Victor Davis Hanson?i. What Middle Eastern countries is Mr. Hanson asking Mr. Kerry about?j. What did President Bush do to Yasir Arafat?k. Who is Madeleine K. Albright?l. What concern does Ms. Albright voice by pointing out troubles the United States is facing in Iraq?m. What obstacles do the Iraqi people face regarding their January elections?n. Why is the Korean Peninsula particularly North Korea considered a threat to the United States and the world?o. Who is Richard A. Clarke?p. After the U.S. presidential election what plan does Mr. Bush have to regain control in Iraq?q. How might Iran be a threat to the United States and world peace?r. What happened in Madrid Spain on March 11 2004?s. Who is Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.?t. What point is Mr. Schlesinger trying to make about religion and war in his question to Mr. Bush about Christian values?3. Divide students into pairs. Explain to students that they will be examining parts of the transcript from the first presidential debate between John Kerry and George W. Bush to discover how well they answered the actual questions they were asked. Assign each pair a question and its complete answer from the transcripts. (Note: The debate format consisted of a question being posed by moderator Jim Lehrer to one or the other candidate followed by a two-minute response and then a 90-second rebuttal as well as an optional extension.) Provide them with a copy of the text they have been assigned. (Complete transcripts of the debate can be found at //www.nytimes.com/2004/10/01/politics/campaign/01dtext.html.) Students will be writing reaction papers examining the performance of the two candidates on a single question-analyzing how each one answered the same question and comparing their performances–and the impact the debate may have on the outcome of the election.To analyze their assigned question and answer instruct each pair to work together to complete the following sentence starters (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):“INSTRUCTIONSAfter reading a question and both candidates’ answers complete the following sentences:-The question is …-On a scale of one to 10 one being the least direct and 10 being the most direct the candidate answered the question …-What the candidate said about the topic is …-What the candidate said that was not about the topic is …-The candidate used rhetorical strategies (repetition analogy pauses in speech etc.) such as …-The candidate did not mention …(which was pertinent to answering the question)-What I don’t understand about the candidate’s answer is …-The questions I still have for this candidate about this topic are …-What I would have liked the candidate to have talked about is …”Once pairs have completed their analysis they share their questions and analysis of the answers with the class to compare their opinions.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually students write a reaction paper based on their in-depth analysis of the transcripts. What do you think of the way Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry answered their questions? What was the purpose of the debate? Was this purpose met? Is this the type of event people should watch and use to make their voting decisions? Why or why not? Did this activity affect your own views about the candidates and the election? If so how?Further Questions for Discussion:-Should political debates be highly regulated and orchestrated? Why or why not?-Why are political debates viewed as important events in an election?-Does watching presidential debates help undecided voters make up their minds?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions thoughtful analysis of the assigned portion of the presidential debate transcripts and thoughtfully written reaction papers.Vocabulary:offensive strongholds genocide coalition sanction asserted alienated allies stake ratify doctrine jurisdiction deployed vigorously centrifuge reinstituted harbored intentions regime apparent abrupt precise induce deployment chastised intentions restore radical ostracizing insurgency pessimistic viable reconcile transformed obstacles credible proclaimed rapid dismally concrete harboring mounted incompetentExtension Activities:1. Read the entire transcript of the debate or watch a videotape of the debate. Then write a letter to one of the candidates critiquing his performance. What recommendations can you make to this candidate for the next debate to make his rhetoric more effective?2. Read the book “No Debate: How the Two Major Parties Secretly Ruin the Presidential Debates” by George Farah and write a book review focusing on the question “How democratic is the political debate process?”3. Create a poster examining the role public debate–in all forms–plays in a democracy.4. Stage a debate on a topic important to your peers school or community.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History – Create a timeline on the history of the presidential debates. When did they begin? Under what circumstances? What organizations were involved with planning and facilitating them? Mark moments that have been considered to be notable and decisive throughout presidential debate history.Global History – Write a paper examining one of the countries or historical events mentioned in the questions asked in “What to Ask John Kerry and George Bush.” Countries include Germany Lebanon Syria North Korea Libya the Sudan and others. Events include African genocide (Rwanda or Sudan) bombings of American embassies in East Africa missile strikes against Osama Bin Laden’s training camps foreign policy with Libya etc. How did this event affect world affairs?Media Studies – The first televised presidential debate was held on September 26 1960 between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy. Create an oral report examining the role of television in the debate process.Science – Create a “How It Works” poster illustrating the physical phenomenon of speech. What organs muscles and nerves are used? How do we speak? What role does the brain play?Teaching with The Times – Compile articles analyzing the debates conducted for the 2004 presidential election (three debates between the presidential candidates and one between the vice-presidential candidates). Keep a running list of critiques about each candidate made by journalists and by citizens quotes in various articles and how the critiques change or remain steady over the course of the debates.

 4697,  1992, a, Although he is the Mayor of this valley idyll in the Cape wine country Frank Arendse does not quite live here. He lives down the road in the mixed-race or "colored" township called Groendal beyond the antique shops and the food boutiques where the road turns from asphalt to red mud.Mr. Arendse whose forebears include an English soldier and a slave from Madagascar is the first nonwhite Mayor to preside over a white jurisdiction in modern South Africa.In 1985 an American anthropologist chose this hamlet disguised under the pseudonymn "Wyndal" to conduct a study of South African whites. They emerged as comfortable and self-absorbed racists. Mr. Arendse says that his selection as Mayor is a great responsibility and an opportunity to get the roads paved on his side of town. It is not he fears a sign that rural South Africa has suddenly gone colorblind. A Merging of 2 TownsHe became Mayor last month after the adjoining towns were merged into a single municipality embracing about 3000 people of mixed race 500 blacks and 1200 whites. The powerless advisory committee that had previously represented the mixed-race majority before the whites-only city council was absorbed into the council pending an election. Two white council members crossed over to elect Mr. Arense Mayor 8 to 4 which means he has the tie-breaking vote in governing the town.
 5447,  1987, a, President Chun Doo Hwan approved sweeping democratic changes today including direct presidential elections and said he hopes they would usher in ''a new era of democratic development and mature politics.''''Let us work another miracle by developing Korea into a model of political development deserving to be so recorded in world history'' Mr. Chun said in a nationally broadcast address. ''We must not be content with having newly become a model of economic development.'' [ Excerpts page A8. ] Mr. Chun's acceptance of change recommended unexpectedly on Monday by his designated successor sealed one of the most dramatic and sudden reversals of policy in South Korea's 39-year history. Gives In to PressuresIt was an action Mr. Chun clearly did not seek but instead had forced upon him by a mixture of street protests United States pressure and concern about the long-range consequences for the South Korean economy and the successful staging of the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. [ In Washington Administration officials described a process of delicate maneuvering over the last few months to encourage the Seoul Government to accept a range of political initiatives. They said the United States had made it clear that it would not support any move by South Korean officials to resist such changes. Page A8. ]Opposition leaders praised Mr. Chun's speech but cautioned that much remained to be done.''This is the beginning of a new step for democracy in Korea'' said Kim Young Sam president of the main opposition group the Reunification Democratic Party. But Mr. Kim warned ''From now on if something untoward should happen the people would not forgive him.'' Overture to Protesters
 31,  2019, a, Dear Simon Branson: Today is going to be a good day and here’s why.Oh wait wrong show.But a person could be forgiven for momentarily confusing “Superhero” the new musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother with “Dear Evan Hansen” the hit musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother.It’s not just that the boys’ names scan so similarly. Or that both shows are about fatherless families: Evan’s the result of divorce; Simon’s the result of an accident. The opening songs (“Anybody Have a Map?” in “Dear Evan Hansen” and “What’s Happening to My Boy?” in “Superhero”) have nearly identical emotional setups including nearly identical phrases about mothers finding their way back to their sons.More fundamentally both “Superhero” and “Dear Evan Hansen” show how damaged people try to use stories whether fictional or outright false to rebuild themselves after trauma — and how they may create new traumas in the process.

 5495,  1987, a, ''Now it's all about a legacy for this team and for Kareem'' Riley said. ''That's the only thing left for them at this point. Once he leaves there'll be a new fresh challenge. Another ring? That's not enough. When I asked them who they thought the greatest team ever was the only team out of their lips was Boston. Every time anyone looks at Russell all they think of is the respect he achieves through his association with that team. These guys have a chance to attain that same kind of respect.''In fact the Lakers are well stocked and well prepared to defend their title perhaps more so than any champion in the last 18 seasons. But talent and preparation as many of their predecessors have proved do not assure any team of repeating. Other factors conspire to undermine the champion's resolve. Jealousy? If this was to have afflicted the Lakers it would have done so last season when Riley passed the torch of leadership from Abdul-Jabbar to Johnson. With that torch came a season in which Johnson took more shots and scored more points than he had in any of his seven previous seasons and won the most valuable player award for the first time. Rather than resist what was a drastic change the Lakers including Abdul-Jabbar seemed inspired by it.Byron Scott James Worthy Michael Cooper and even Abdul-Jabbar all either had what Riley calls ''career seasons'' or surpassed their achievements of the previous season.''I think everybody has taken their game to a higher level'' said Scott the Lakers' other guard. ''We all still take our cues from Magic. It's worked so far.''This season Johnson and his lucrative smile dominate the cover of the team's media guide clutching the golden championship trophy behind smaller images of Abdul-Jabbar Cooper Worthy and Riley. So far copies of the book have not been passed around the locker room. Greed? It often happens that teams are weakened by the desire of players to cash in on their championship seasons or the feeling by management that it must make personnel changes in order to avoid stagnation. Either the team loses one or more players through free agency or it executes a trade or players press for renegotiation of their contracts all of which tinker with the championship team's already-delicate balance. For example in the year following the Seattle Supersonics' championship season in 1979 tensions between starting guards Dennis Johnson and Gus Williams - primarily over money - and their coach Lenny Wilkens began a long decline for that team.On Friday evening at the Forum perhaps all but one of the 12 players who were members of the championship team will be present to receive their rings. Adrian Branch a bit player is on the verge of losing his place on the roster to Milt Wagner the former Louisville guard or Jeff Lamp formerly of Virginia.And the only player who has crowed for a raise is Johnson who is unhappy with his $1 million salary (even with $1.5 million in deferred money starting in 1994) which is about $2.5 million less than what Abdul-Jabbar earns. Jerry Buss the team owner will probably settle the issue before it becomes a problem. Injuries? This is the one area over which no one has control and it is already beginning to have an effect. Johnson played in only three games during the exhibition season because of tendinitis in his left ankle a condition that will require him to wear a specially constructed shoe and perhaps undergo regular treatment. And last week Worthy suffered a sprained ankle in an exhibition game against the Nets. It was not diagnosed as being severe although Worthy has missed two games.
 1709,  2009, a, Reed Saxon/Associated PressAs expected Michael Jackson had several of the best-selling albums in the country last week as fans rushed to stores and download services in the days after his death last Thursday.Three titles by Mr. Jackson each had more than 100000 sales in the United States in the week that ended Sunday: “Number Ones” sold 108000 “The Essential Michael Jackson” sold 102000 and “Thriller” — which was reissued last year in multiple commemorative versions — sold 101000 according to preliminary sales data from Nielsen SoundScan that was reported by Billboard. (Mr. Jackson’s music is released by divisions of Sony Music Entertainment.) By contrast the top-selling new album was the Black Eyed Peas‘ “The E.N.D.” (Interscope) with 88000 copies.But because of Billboard’s rules Mr. Jackson’s albums do not qualify for the Billboard 200 its standard albums chart because they were all released more than 18 months ago. Instead the Black Eyed Peas album is at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and Mr. Jackson occupies the top nine slots on the Billboard catalog chart as either a solo artist or member of the Jackson 5 a record for that chart.In total Mr. Jackson sold 415000 albums in the United States last week according to the preliminary numbers; final numbers are expected on Wednesday. The week before he sold only 10000 and last week’s total is 40 percent more than Mr. Jackson’s entire catalog had sold for the year up to June 21 Billboard reported Tuesday night.A remarkable 2.6 million songs by Mr. Jackson as a solo act or with the Jackson 5 were downloaded digitally through last Sunday the standard end of the sales week of the SoundScan tracking service upon whose numbers Billboard bases its charts. (Downloads for the week before were 48000.) A total of 58 percent of the sales last week were downloads and Mr. Jackson has become the first artist to sell more than a million song downloads in a single week.Many retailers reportedly ran out of available stock of CD’s and for days after Mr. Jackson’s death his albums occupied most of the top slots on the running music sales charts for iTunes and Amazon.com.

 1752,  2009, a, Two posts on “Sesame Street” in one week? No we haven’t (completely) regressed to childhood — we just had to share this puppet parody of “Mad Men” that will be shown as part of the coming 40th anniversary season of “Sesame Street.”In this clip you won’t see Big Bird cast as Roger Sterling or Elmo as Pete Campbell but you will learn valuable differences about the emotions of mad sad and happy. (For the grownups in the room there’s also a joke involving the word sycophants.) And you can be assured you won’t see anyone’s foot get run over with a lawnmower.Watch the “Sesame Street” parody of “Mad Men”:
 5396,  1987, a, ''Certainly I wasn't in a hurry to run fast after last week and with the world championships next week'' Coghlan said. Last week he ran 2000 meters longer than a mile.Of course the national-indoor-championships record crowd of almost 16000 wasn't thinking about last week or next. They were hoping to see as fast a race as possible.They weren't even to know how fast the mile was going however. The scoreboard timer wasn't operating. Instead all they saw was ''0:00'' on the board in the one event in which every fan is concerned about the time. Fans had to settle for calls after each quarter over the loudspeaker. But when the race was run no one except those who had stopwatches and could use them accurately even knew that Coghlan had eclipsed 4 minutes again.Carl Lewis also conceded that he wasn't that concerned about speed -in fact he said he didn't even care about winning.''This meet really has nothing to do with anything'' he said.''I just want to get on the 11:15 plane back home'' he said after finishing third in the 55-meter dash. He failed to qualify on the American team for the world indoor championships.''Even if I had'' he said ''the 55-meter to me is just a warm-up for the 100-meter outdoors. I ran indoors to work up my first 60 yards.'' Sour Grapes Attitude? Sour grapes? Perhaps. But he said he planned to start training again on Tuesday for the long jump (in which he captured one of four Olympic gold medals). He underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last November.If there were other distractions for Sergei Bubka the world's best pole-vaulter they could not be discerned so easily. In the warm-ups he corrected the public-address announcer over how many times he had set world records. Bubka then passed a chance to leap at 17 feet 9 1/4 inches at 18-1 1/4 and 18-5 1/4. The Soviet star though then failed three times at 18-9 1/4. He refused to be interviewed later.

 5292,  1988, a, That strange hybrid of politics and entertainment the televised political drama made its explosive debut here this week bringing with it spontaneity name calling rapid-fire dialogue and the oddly American phenomenon of pop political stardom.What the Army-McCarthy hearings did for Joseph Welch what the Watergate hearings did for John Dean and Sam Ervin and what the Iran-contra hearings did for Oliver North the 19th Communist Party conference is doing for the likes of Vladimir I. Melnikov Vladimir P. Kabaidze and Mikhail A. Ulyanov.For an actor like Mr. Ulyanov who makes a living playing Lenin the consummate politician on stage stardom was easily won -the more so because his straight man in an unexpected dialogue Wednesday was Mikhail S. Gorbachev the Communist Party's General Secretary. #4 Accused of Taking Bribes But some of the most dramatic moments of the conference included in the highlights broadcast so far were grabbed by Mr. Melnikov - a wooden regional politician who today called two Politburo members the brakes on the wheels of political reform - and Mr. Kabaidze a factory manager whose thoughts bounced around like the ball in a pinball game but who electrified his audience with an indictment of the bureaucracy-bound economy.And you could almost hear the gasps that must have echoed in cramped living rooms from Uzhgorod to Yakutsk when Vitaly A. Korotich editor of the feisty weekly magazine Ogonyok handed Mr. Gorbachev documents that he said contained the names of four bribe-takers all of them delegates to the conference.

 707,  2015, a, “I found my peace when I decided to never kill again” Eastman said.And thus was the new Morgan explained his new code for survival solidified when his most coldblooded murder literally came back to haunt him giving his sensei a mortal nibble. As death descended Eastman handed over his lucky rabbit foot the one we saw in the Season 5 finale and gave a final piece of advice that sent Morgan on the quest back to Rick and friends. “You could stay here but you shouldn’t stay here” he said. “Everything is about people; everything in this life that is worth a damn.”And therein as another sage storyteller once put it lies the rub. Because not-killing in the name of preserving your own inner peace is great for you and your adversary but less so for the people who might encounter that adversary later. The Wolves Morgan declined to kill last season including the one he lectured on Sunday later took out others and eventually attacked the Alexandrians who were feeding and sheltering Morgan. At least one of the Wolves he turned loose in Episode 2 appeared to attack Rick last week.Inner peace is great but preserving it in such a way that jeopardizes the people who both sustain and depend on you is ultimately an act of selfishness. If you let me go Morgan’s captive told him after his story “I’m going to have to kill you Morgan — I’m going to have to kill everyone” children included. “Those are the rules” he said. “That’s my code.” So chew on that Morgan-san.That’s the problem with codes: They work in isolation but get trickier when they bump up against one another. For all the objective nobility of Morgan’s decision about how to exist in the world it doesn’t really answer the question about what he owes everyone else and how best to satisfy those obligations. That’s a riddle that he and nearly everyone else on this show whether it’s Rick’s ruling with an iron fist or Glenn’s encouraging others at his own peril have yet to solve.A Few Thoughts While We Put Our Feet Up• Glenn Watch: No answers this week not that I expected them. And not that I’m complaining either. I’m not sure Sunday’s episode needed to be 90 minutes long. (Does any TV show need to be 90 minutes long which seems to happen more and more these days?) But I do think after the pace of the first three we all could use a little break. (Update: Commenters and others point out that Steven Yeun was left out of the opening credits.)• Enjoyed the flaming walker who emerged from Morgan’s fire in the early part of the episode. Seems like you could weaponize those things right? Light them and direct them into a rival camp? I suppose it doesn’t show much regard for one’s opponent but it would be fun to watch.

 182,  2018, a, KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia — In highway billboards and radio announcements the government of Malaysia is warning of a new enemy: “fake news.”On Monday the lower house of Parliament passed a bill outlawing fake news the first measure of its kind in the world. The proposal which allows for up to six years in prison for publishing or circulating misleading information is expected to pass the Senate this week and to come into effect soon after.The legislation would punish not only those who are behind fake news but also anyone who maliciously spreads such material. Online service providers would be responsible for third-party content and anyone could lodge a complaint. As long as Malaysia or Malaysians are affected fake news generated outside the country is also subject to prosecution.What qualifies as fake news however is ill defined. Ultimately the government would be given broad latitude to decide what constitutes fact in Malaysia.

 112,  2019, a, He backtracked on Thursday after his proposal was roundly criticized.“While my intentions were sincere I did not expect it to be seen as a huge mistake that has offended many women and no less men who considered it insulting” Mr. Imran said.The idea that sexual assault victims share responsibility for the attack — redirecting blame from the perpetrators who actively chose to carry out an assault — is widely considered a myth with destructive consequences. Many activists say it is a major reason that so many sexual assaults are not reported.Mr. Imran’s comments were quickly condemned by activists and other politicians.Wan Azizah Ismail a deputy prime minister and the minister of women family and community development said in a statement that she welcomed the apology but that the senator should go through gender sensitivity training “so that the causes and consequences of violence against women can be better understood together.”“To blame women for the bad behavior from men is not acceptable” she said.Sisters in Islam a women’s rights group in Malaysia said in a statement that “men should police their own thoughts words and actions and not take crimes committed by men against women lightly.”Nor were men happy with their depiction as out-of-control primates unable to control themselves.“As a man and I would like to think a full-blooded male I find it preposterous and even insulting that you think that men are so easily seduced into committing a crime of a sexual nature” Dharm Navaratnam wrote in an open letter published in The Malay Mail.

 2666,  2004, a, Brothers in Tragedy Look for Answers'Two BrothersWho Are Not Brothers'Players TheaterIt is evident almost immediately that "Two Brothers Who Are Not Brothers" a new two-hander by Paul Rawlings that is running at the Players Theater on Macdougal Street is going to offer only limited insights into the cosmic questions it seeks to explore. When the lights come up on Dix the disillusioned half of the pair he is sporting facial hair and a wiseacre delivery. And when Jack the man of faith appears he has unshakable convictions and a Southern accent. Ah the blissful lazy world of theatrical shorthand where all cynics are bearded and all conservative Christians are doctrinaire and from below the Mason-Dixon line.The two men brothers-in-law have been visited by extreme tragedy though to say more would be to severely undercut the first act a collection of fragmentary dialogue that seeks to get you guessing about who's who and what has happened but mostly is just annoying. Jack (John Jimerson) and Dix (Joe Thompson) polar opposites in good Theater 101 fashion are coping with loss each in his own way Jack proclaiming his faith in Jesus Dix getting rid of clothing and furniture and house and anything else that might remind him of happier days.Mr. Rawlings tries to work this into a pithy discussion of faith and fate and why God if there is a God lets bad things happen. But he doesn't have much new to offer on these ageless questions especially not in a city that has been pondering them with far more nuance since Sept. 11 2001.That's not to say that it is without compelling notions. A few stretches where Jack confronts the realization that you can't force faith or friendship onto someone who doesn't want it are nicely rendered and acted. So is a moment when Jack briefly comes face-to-face with the possibility that faith can only take you so far an idea from which he quickly retreats. "We have got to endure this without trying to understand" he says a starkly eloquent admission that may have been the bottom line for many New Yorkers. NEIL GENZLINGER
 96,  2019, a, ISTANBUL — Even before he began his first day at work as Istanbul’s new mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was being talked about as the man who could challenge President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the leadership of Turkey in four years’ time.For the moment he is avoiding the question and insists that he will concentrate for the next five years on serving Istanbul a sprawling metropolis of 15 million inhabitants a quarter of whom live below the poverty line.“Right now I am a person who is fully concentrated on governing” he told foreign journalists at a news briefing on his first day in office last Friday. “But if there are those who see our star high in the sky we thank them.”There is no doubt that he presents a broader threat to the president. Mr. Imamoglu said he fully intended to use the enormous popular support that elected him by a surprisingly wide margin in a rerun on June 23 as a mandate to push back against Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarianism and bring democracy and fairness to all of Turkey.

 2832,  2003, a, Cellphones are a boon to stagecraft. With only a small clutch of electronics pressed to the head characters can now convincingly perform monologues anywhere: in cars on the beach in the tub. ''Karen Sisco'' which has its premiere tonight exploits this device spinning drama chiefly from close-ups on the radiantly made-up face of Carla Gugino the show's star as she bathes paces and drives in Miami. And all the while talks into her flip-top mobile.Sisco begins the pilot with a bad hangover. She is an alcoholic United States marshal who can't remember a recent shootout that knocked her out and garishly wounded her chest. As she tries to remember the show joins its amnesia plot with a sleeping-with-the-enemy plot in a two-for-one evening of favorite action formulas.''Karen Sisco'' is driven by a soundtrack of cool jazz -- easy listening that may remind viewers of being on hold. But on hold for what? The show seems to promise disclosures and entanglements but by the end of the first episode nothing seems to have happened. An intricate romance simply evaporates and Sisco gives no clue about why it even got started.Still your call is important to ABC and it's worth standing by for the second episode of ''Karen Sisco'' which will be shown next Wednesday. A prisoner sees an unexpected chance to escape his handler and he flees. Sisco who could have apprehended him also accidentally lets him go. This time she is not morally remote or immune to change. Rather she seems to have lost her virtuosity as a marshal even before the show can establish it.

 4050,  1996, a, But the Clinton White House like previous Administrations citing national security issues and fears of foreign terrorists or criminals is loath to permit the export of some of the most powerful data-scrambling software. The reason has chiefly been that intelligence agencies feared such equipment would be used by foreign terrorists drug cartels and other criminals to hide transactions and communications.Now in a compromise according to two senior officials in the Administration who have been deeply involved in the new policy American companies will be permitted on Jan. 1 to export software that encrypts or scrambles data using ''keys'' -- lengthy numeric codes -- that are up to 56 bits long. Until now companies have been prohibited from selling products abroad that have keys longer than 40 bits.Mr. Clinton has also decided to move the authority for exporting the encryption software from the State Department which has had export-licensing authority because the technology has been classified as munitions to the Commerce Department which controls the export of products that have both commercial and military use. Industry officials have long urged that change betting the Commerce Department would be more inclined to give a higher priority to American competitive interests.But starting in two years American companies choosing to export the more sophisticated software would have to set up what the industry is calling a ''key recovery'' system. That system would enable intelligence officials and law enforcement agents armed with court warrants to go through a lengthy multistep process that would give them the mathematical key to decoding scrambled communications.The approach replaces the Administration's earlier proposed ''key escrow'' system in which the Government would have been the repository of the numeric keys -- leading to fears of potential Government abuse or a reluctance by legitimate foreign users to buy the software.
 6313,  1971, a, WASHINGTON Dec. 2 —Diplomatic informants here said today that the $100‐million effort of the United Nations re lief agency in East Pakistan is “grinding to a halt” and that the agency has abandoned 162 new trucks bought with international relief funds at Chittagong because of fighting in the area.The informants said the agency had removed the rotors from the trucks’ engines to prevent seizure of the vehicles either by the Pakistani Army or by local Bengali guerrillas. Pakistani authorities in the area the informants said were furious about this.The agency is however still using 100 other trucks in other areas in East Pakistan.The United Nations agency has left one staff man at Chittangong to watch over the trucks which cost $5000 to $10000 each in the hope that the fighting will die down soon and distribution of food grains and other goods may be resumed.Agency Staff ReducedBut in recent weeks according to trustworthy sources the agency has reduced its operating personnel in East Pakistan by approximately threefifths.
 203,  2018, a, The country’s crises are many: a million Syrian refugees are straining public services; a shaky economy is increasingly teetering; garbage is piling up; fear is spreading of a new war between Hezbollah and Israel; and the political class has failed to find solutions.But despite the country’s pride in being a rare Arab democracy few expect the long-awaited elections to do much to solve its pressing problems.“Is this going to bring a new government that is able to change things?” said Sami Atallah the director of the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies. “No because we have a system that has successfully undermined all accountability mechanisms. As long as these are not in place I can’t see how these politicians will be able to deliver to the people.”Lebanon’s political system is an unwieldy compromise based on sect-based power sharing. Half the seats in Parliament are assigned to Christians and half to Muslims. Most parties are based on sect and their supporters look to them for protection and patronage more than for sound policies. Some are still led by warlords from the country’s 15-year civil war or their offspring.Since 2009 the government has collapsed twice and the country went without a president for more than two years because the factions could not agree on one.

 6015,  1978, a, •James O. Eastland's decision not to seek re‐election to the Senate perhaps tells a lot about the revolution wrought in Southerh politics by the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the last of the great legislative victories of the late Rev. Dr. .Martin Luther King Jr. The law did away with virtually all‐white electorates of the kind that first sent Mr. East land to’ the Senate in 1942 and maintained his generation of Southern segregationists in office. Since 1965 over two million new black voters have registered in the South most of them in the seven states where the Voting Rights Act outlawed literacy tests and put the registration process under Federal control. Almost 2200 black politicians hold office today in the old Confederacy 11 states that before 1965 had fewer than 100 black officeholders. [A1:1‐3.]MetropolitanTwo policemen were killed in an exchange of gunfire with two men in Brooklyn's Bedford‐Stuyvesant section. A 26‐year‐old former convict one of the officers’ alleged assailants was killed. His companion was wounded and was captured after an escape attempt. The officers were Christie O. Massone 33 and Norman R. Cerullo 29 both of the 79th Precinct. The shooting started while Officer Cerullo was making a routine security check of a doorway on Willoughby Street. In minutes both officers were killed in a volley of 14 shots from an automatic pistol the police said. [A1:3.5.]•Mayor Koch's goal in negotiating with the city's labor unions people close to him say is to get the unions to settle for less than thetransit workers got. The strategy was decided on when the Mayor agreed to the transit accord the sources said. Even as Mr. Koch was announcing the transit settlement on Saturday morning calling it “responsible and reasonable” he knew that the city did not have the $800 million that would be needed to duplicate its wage terms for all municipal workers. [A1:4‐5.]•The prosecuting attorney at the multiple‐murder trial of Dr. Mario E. Jascalevich in Hackensack N. J. has been taunted instulted and mocked by the defense attorney who in her view has implicitly been encouraged by the judge William R. Arnold. The prosecutor Sybil R. Moses moved that Judge Arnold disqualify himself and to this the defense attorney Raymond R. Brown has responded that the motion indicates the prosecution's case is‐falling apart. Today Judge Arnold will hear arguments on whether he should step down. [A1:4‐6.]Business/FinanceThe torrent of oil coming through the trans ‐ Alaskan pipeline has brought even more problems than the pipeline's critics foresaw. Consequently Federal energy officials are considering swift remedial action. The principal problem is the vast oversupply of oil on the West Coast. Early estimates of projected use of the pipeline's oil in Western states have proved to be far too high California's own oil production has suffered significantly and the need there to move unexpectedly large quantities of oil has pushed tanker rates 50 percent above predictions.

 5654,  1986, a, BELLINI'S ''Puritani'' ideally calls for four major vocal personalities - technically and artistically on the highest level musically creative and impassioned - in the four principal parts. Joan Sutherland has been showing that it can get by on one even when the one is in the autumn of her career in recent weeks at the Metropolitan. Saturday afternoon her ''cover'' Francoise Garner made her regularly scheduled appearance in the soprano part and though she carried through creditably enough in her own terms the opera does not work this way.Miss Garner has a secure voice and though it is not of outstanding size or quality one never feared misfortune or worried about her ability to sustain the part. She could do herself a great favor by serious work on florid singing; her execution was only occasionally accurate and clear. She went through the staging with confidence but not with command. Perhaps in a less virtuosic role she might make a better impression; one cannot help questioning the wisdom (Miss Garner's or the Met's) of scheduling appearances for the cover singers in cases like this.Salvatore Fisichella repeated his brightly Italianate but routinely sung Arturo Sherrill Milnes his distressingly effortful Riccardo and Samuel Ramey his vocally sound but musically and dramatically lackluster Giorgio.

 3344,  2000, a, They had to get their Kournikova fix. Kournikova fed their addictions -- and ended their fears of a second-round exit -- by cutting down her errors to erase a series of early service breaks. The instant she dismissed Sandra Kleinova 6-4 6-1 there was a sigh of relief on the grounds.Although Serena Williams advanced to the third round in less than an hour last night the afternoon was inundated with deep exhales by a couple of top women. Fourth-seeded Mary Pierce had to regroup after a series of careless forehands and mishandled volleys caused her to drop the second set against the youngest of the flying Maleeva sisters. But Magdalena the sibling of Manuela and Katerina could not sustain her run of five second-set aces and Pierce went on to close her out 7-5 2-6 6-1.Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport also had a scare. For the entire first set the nimble Kim Clijsters ran down Davenport's heavy ground strokes transferred that incoming power into blistering passing shots and had her slower opponent on a futile chase around the court. But as Clijsters's drop-shots began to sit up too high when she couldn't combat Davenport's rise in intensity she left worn and defeated 4-6 6-2 6-2.''It's a Grand Slam'' said Davenport who fought off a break point in the third game of the second set then ran off five games in a row. ''I mean I wasn't ready to walk out yet.''Agassi left almost eagerly. Moments after his match he walked into the interview room listened to the questions and dispersed short replies. When asked if his heart was in the match he said flatly ''Yeah very much.'' When asked if his recent back injury hampered his movement he said ''No.'' After being asked at what point he found out that his mother and sister were ill he said ''When it happened.''Earlier in the week and for the first and only time he did discuss the health of his sister Tammee and his mother Elizabeth during an interview with the CBS tennis analyst Mary Carillo. At one point he talked about how difficult it was to maintain his concentration.Yesterday that was evident. An initial hit of adrenaline -- which left him up 2-0 in the first set -- quickly petered out. On break point in the eighth game of the first set Agassi failed to get his feet in position for a forehand that careened into the net. By the end of the first set Agassi had lost 14 of 17 points.

 221,  2018, a, Good morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)It has been two months since officials at the University of Southern California announced that the university’s president C.L. Max Nikias would resign. The announcement came after a sustained outcry from faculty students and alumni over the way the administration dealt with Dr. George Tyndall a longtime gynecologist accused of inappropriate behavior for decades. The faculty offered a vote of no confidence and hundreds of top professors publicly called for his resignation.But while the board of trustees announcedon May 25 that Mr. Nikias “agreed to begin an orderly transition” to a new administration little has changed on campus this summer. Now more than 650 professors have signed a letter demanding that he leave before students arrive this month.“With no follow-up regarding an interim president or a presidential search process we find ourselves in a state of turmoil and uncertainty” the letter addressed to the board of trustees said. “President Nikias cannot be the one who stands up to greet the new students at the convocation. If he is we face the prospect of student protests and walkouts parent outrage and a broad public perception that we have gone back on our commitment to accountability and transparency as the world outside U.S.C. believes he has already resigned.”Brenda Maceo the university’s vice president for public relations and marketing said in an email that Mr. Nikias is on vacation as is his top deputy Provost Michael Quick. In their absence Jim Staten the chief financial officer of the university is acting president until Mr. Quick returns she said.

Local residents contend that the cabins are important to the preservastion of human life in the area.

 1304,  2011, a, Mark Lennihan/Associated PressThe American International Group said on Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with MetLife to sell shares it owns in its rival gained as part of a deal between the two insurers earlier than expected.A.I.G. could reap more than $9 billion in proceeds from the stock sales based on MetLife’s closing share price of $46.04. Its holdings in MetLife are composed of common and preferred stock that are equivalent to 146.8 million shares and equity units with a stated value of $3 billion.A.I.G. is itself preparing for an enormous offering of its own shares that would drastically cut the Treasury Department‘s 92.1 percent ownership stake in the insurer. That stock sale called a re-I.P.O. is likely to come in May people briefed on the matter previously told DealBook.A.I.G. gained its MetLife holdings when it sold its American Life Insurance Company unit to its competitor last year one of several deals aimed at raising money to repay its $182 billion taxpayer-financed bailout. The specific mix of MetLife equities was chosen to cap A.I.G.’s ownership in a major rival.Under the terms of the deal worked out by A.I.G. MetLife and the Treasury Department A.I.G. will sell the common shares and equity units. MetLife will buy back the preferred shares drawing largely from the proceeds from a concurrent stock offering of 68.5 million shares.The discussions among the three parties came together over the past few weeks people briefed on the matter told DealBook. All three agreed to expedite the timetable which would help A.I.G. shed its ties to the government. MetLife would also benefit from removing an overhang of having so many shares — equivalent to about 14 percent of its outstanding stock — tied up by A.I.G.One reason driving the decision was the rise in MetLife’s share price which is almost at its one-year high.“We appreciate MetLife’s agreement to permit the proposed sales” Robert S. Miller A.I.G.’s chairman said in a statement. “As a result A.I.G. expects to take another major step forward.”A.I.G. is expected to market its stock sales on Wednesday and Thursday people briefed on the matter told DealBook.The lead bookrunners for A.I.G.’s stock offerings are Goldman Sachs Citigroup and Credit Suisse.

 5026,  1990, a, Georgia Tech from 1904 to 1966 featured a coaching clan of John Heisman (yes the Heisman for whom the trophy is named) William Alexander and Bobby Dodd for whom the Yellow Jackets' stadium is named. Each of those coaches won at least 102 games. From 1939 through 1966 Georgia Tech nearly always finished ranked among the nation's top 15 teams. It is one of only four teams along with Alabama Georgia and Notre Dame to win each of the major bowls (the '29 Rose the '55 Cotton the '40 '48 and '52 Orange and '44 '53 '54 and '56 Sugar).Attempting to recapture that stature Ross hired a veteran staff of assistants and mixed them with promising young coaches. He credits his staff for taking the lead and beyond in the recruiting wars leaving few stones unturned.One of his most remarkable accomplishments was not only garnering talented players but speedy ones too. Virginia's offense ranks first nationally averaging 544.9 yards and 48.1 points a game. But the Yellow Jackets on both sides of the football possess the speed to keep track."Speed is a difficult thing to identify but our coaches had a feel" Ross said. "I put emphasis on it. I told them I didn't care how big the recruits were they just better be able to run." Special SatisfactionGeorgia Tech's recruiting class of 1988 mirrors Ross's philosophy. The quarterback Shawn Jones the safety Ken Swilling and the receiver Bobby Rodriguez were part of a prize group signed that year.Rodriguez from from Wagner High School in New York City mirrors the thinking of Ross's recruits."When you go to a team that has struggled and you see the accomplishment it means so much more" said Rodriguez who opted for Georgia Tech over Syracuse and Michigan State. "All the guys that I came in with are excited that much of the change here coincided with when we came."With Coach Ross we have a very honest and caring coach and those are his two attributes that stand out most. He is a very intelligent coach. He runs a pro-style offense and that suited me perfectly. And with Atlanta being a major city guys from big cities like New York and Los Angeles love it here. It socially gives you a slower pace but not too slow." New Hero Emerges

 6178,  1976, a, Many of the details of the bribery of Japanese politicians by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in the late 1950's in connection with the sale of the F‐104 fighter plane to Japan were reported at that time to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington according to a former C.I.A. official and Japanese sources.Although the C.I.A. was aware of the bribery almost disclosure of the payoffs did not come until last Feb. 4 in hearings of the Senate subcommittee on multinational corporations.The scandal has created international tensions and touched off worldwide investigations of the payments by Lockheed and other American companies to various parties in Europe Japan and the Middle East to win lucrative multimillion‐dollar sales contracts for various products ranging from aircraft to pharmaceuticals.The Lockheed payoffs in Japan involving $12.6 million over a period of 20 years were made to top officials of the Government primarily through Yoshio Kodama an influential power broker in Japan who has already been identified as the most important behind‐the‐scenes representative of Lockeed at that time.

 5492,  1987, a, LIKE FINE WINE PREMIUM WHISKY should be sipped and savored. And like fine wine each variety and brand of premium whisky is distinguished by its own color bouquet flavor texture and lingering taste.If great wine is in the grape great whisky is in the grain. ''No amount of aging will make good whisky out of an inferior batch of grain'' wrote Alexis Lichine the author of influential wine books in his ''Alexis Lichine's New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits.''The grains used by whisky makers include corn rye wheat barley and malted or germinated barley. They are mashed with water - regional differences add to the unique character of each whisky - and fermented. The resulting potion is distilled - evaporated and recondensed - to remove impurities and produce the heady spirit that the Celts named uisce beathadh (ISH-ke-BA-ha) the water of life.But aging is crucial too. Maturing whisky draws complexity and color from a long sleep in wooden barrels. That's why all premium whiskies are aged in cask at least 10 and as many as 25 years - way above the minimum two to four years generally required by the laws of whisky-producing countries. (Unlike wine whisky's evolution stops as soon as it is bottled though there are very subtle changes once the bottle is opened.) Which grains are used and how they are processed blended and aged varies from country to country region to region and distillery to distillery. The result is an array of distinctly different spirits available in the United States. Aficionados generally consider America's bourbon and Scotland's single-malt whiskies to be the best of the premiums. They are followed by blended Scotch whiskies (the most widely available in this country) Irish whisky and finally Tennessee sour-mash and Canadian whiskies. All are excellent and suitable not only as aperitifs but as after-dinner drinks as well. Bourbon had its beginnings in Bourbon County Ky. during colonial times and is still produced primarily in that state. It is made from a mixture of grains that by Federal law must be at least 51 percent corn; at least 25 percent of that mash is usually drawn from a previous distillation which sours over time. This ''sour mash'' process makes continuity of character possible.

 85,  2019, a, LONDON — The French police searched Renault’s headquarters on Wednesday as part of a misconduct investigation into Carlos Ghosn the automaker’s former chairman and chief executive.Renault confirmed the raid at the headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt just outside Paris. “We are fully cooperating with the authorities” Astrid de Latude a spokeswoman for the company said. She declined to provide any further details about the search.The search which started in the morning was linked to an investigation into the financing of Mr. Ghosn’s marriage reception at the Chateau of Versailles said Emmanuelle Lepissier the chief administrative officer of the public prosecutor's department in Nanterre which is overseeing the investigation.French news media had earlier reported that the raid was tied to the Ghosn case. Renault has referred information to prosecutors that Mr. Ghosn who headed the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi car alliance and who was arrested in November on suspicion of financial misconduct may have misused company money to finance a lavish Marie Antoinette-themed party at Versailles in 2016 to celebrate his second marriage and his wife’s 50th birthday.

 4887,  1990, a, FOR six years American corporations have been buying their own stock in a big way. The original idea was to help protect the company from a takeover. But now the takeover threat is waning while the buybacks are as strong as ever. Clearly they have taken on a life of their own with important consequences for America's economy.Most companies pay for stock repurchases from profits or other funds on hand. Indeed years of economic growth allowed corporate America to bank more than $120 billion since 1985 according to the Commerce Department. This mountain of cash could be paying for advanced machinery or to take a gamble financing the development of valuable new products: a new television technology a supersonic commercial aircraft a breakthrough medicine.And some is but buying back stock has gotten the nod as the surest most profitable way for a company to put the money to use.The choices are not black and white. Three companies that recently announced large buybacks the General Electric Company the NCR Corporation and the Union Camp Corporation also spend on new factories and research. But they are doing so these days only up to a point. ''A number of companies are in effect saying that they already have too much invested in plant and equipment to earn an adequate return'' said Jerry Jasinowski president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
 561,  2015, a, PhotoMario Draghi the president of the European Central Bank may be pushing hard for a weaker euro to spur growth in Europe but his central bank peers seem to be several steps ahead of him.In an interview with a German newspaper on Friday Mr. Draghi known for using his public comments to achieve policy goals said the threat of deflation might force his bank to take more aggressive stimulus measures which could include buying eurozone bonds in bulk.His comments prompted the euro to fall to $1.20 a four-and-a-half year low against the dollar. More important it also highlighted a powerful new trend in world currency markets: Global central banks — along with investors also wary of the low returns that their euros have been delivering — have increasingly been switching into dollars and out of euros.On Friday the dollar also hit a multiyear high against the Japanese yen and it was also gaining on the fragile currencies in Brazil Turkey and Russia.The expectation is that a rapidly recovering United States economy will push the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates this year making dollar-based assets more attractive than those denominated in euros Japanese yen and emerging market currencies.By contrast Europe’s economy remains stagnant and November’s inflation rate of 0.3 percent was a blunt reminder of how far Europe’s central bank is from meeting its inflation target of 2 percent.To jump-start growth and avoid deflation many analysts say the most powerful policy arrow in Mr. Draghi’s quiver is to talk the euro sharply downward which would bolster exports increase the price of imports and ultimately it is hoped stimulate an increase in inflation.“The euro is going to go down because it really needs to” said Jens Nordvig the global head of currency strategy at Nomura in New York. “The divergence between European and U.S. growth is very very wide now.”Mr. Nordvig pointed to recent data from the International Monetary Fund showing that in the third quarter of 2014 global central banks were big euro sellers and dollar buyers. As a result the proportion of global reserves held in dollars moved to 62 percent from 60 percent and the euro’s share fell to 22 percent from 24 percent.In an $11 trillion market moves of this magnitude are highly unusual and they could signal a long-term preference on the part of central bankers for high-yielding dollars in favor of less lucrative euros.Photo“This was shocking to me” Mr. Nordvig added. “And it really opens the way for a weaker euro.”The weakness in the euro on Friday came after Mr. Draghi in an interview in Handelsblatt of Germany said “The risks of not fulfilling our mandate of price stability are in any case higher than they were six months ago.”Investors interpreted Mr. Draghi’s comments to mean that the central bank was moving closer to broad-based purchases of government bonds possibly as soon as its next monetary policy meeting on Jan. 22.“There are growing indications that the E.C.B. will decide as early as January to buy government bonds on a large scale” Ralph Solveen an economist at Commerzbank wrote in a note to clients on Friday.Yields on government bonds in the eurozone also declined on Friday as their prices rose. The yield on the two-year German government note fell to a new low of minus 0.11 percent. The yield has been below zero since September; investors are effectively willing to pay the German government to keep their money safe. The yield on the 10-year German note fell to 0.49 percent from 0.54 percent on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note fell to 2.11 percent from 2.17 percent on Wednesday.The decline in the euro may have further to go. Many currency specialists expect the euro to weaken quickly to 1.18 or 1.17 against the dollar. But they caution that the time lag between a weaker currency and higher growth and inflation can be considerable.Japan is a prime example in this regard. Since the middle of 2012 the yen has lost a third of its value against the dollar yet the growth in Japanese exports has been disappointing and the economy remains stuck in a deflationary slump.A strong dollar is a welcome reflection of a United States economy that is growing and adding jobs at a faster clip than many of its peers. But if the currency climbs too much too quickly corporate profits can suffer. When the dollar is worth more against other currencies it pushes up the price of American goods and services in overseas markets. This can lead to lower exports and weaker earnings for many American companies.Douglas A. Kass of Seabreeze Partners a hedge fund said the rising dollar was most likely a reason behind the decline in a measure of United States manufacturing activity that was released on Friday.“We are starting to see the impact of a higher U.S. dollar on domestic manufacturing” Mr. Kass said in an email. “This is one of the unintended consequences of a strengthening currency.”And while United States economic growth is largely driven by domestic factors economists worry about the nation’s ability to expand over the long term when its major trading partners — Europe Japan and China — are experiencing growth slowdowns of various sorts.Still currency specialists note that the dollar’s strong run started fairly recently and was preceded by more than a decade of persistent weakness. Measured against a basket of global currencies the dollar remains 20 percent below its high in 2002.Moreover some analysts say the currency effect on American corporations may well be muted — outweighed over time by the positive effect of a recovering European economy drawing in more exports from the United States.Bank of America Merrill Lynch calculates that a 10 percent increase in the dollar against the euro would shave a little under 2 percent off the earnings of major exporters within the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in 2015.“It is not just a cut-and-dried currency effect” said Savita Subramanian an equity strategist with Merrill Lynch. “There is also the global growth picture.”Mr. Draghi has for the better part of a year now tried to make the case that to stave off deflation and low growth wholesale purchases of eurozone bonds must be considered.Unlike central bankers in Japan the United States and Britain Mr. Draghi represents not just one country but the conflicting agendas of the 19 countries that use the euro. That includes the depression-hobbled Greece and the cash-rich Germany which remains perpetually wary of the central bank loading up on risky eurozone bonds.And while many analysts now expect him to formalize this decision this month it could well be that Mr. Draghi’s big bet for a European recovery is less the actual buying of the bonds in question which will remain a politically draining exercise.Instead it could be a euro in free fall — driven by central banks moving into dollars and the foreign currency traders that follow in their wake — that does the job for him.

 2369,  2005, a, MALIPO China - After a walk up a steep stone staircase first-time visitors are astonished when the veterans' cemetery just outside this town finally pops into view: as far as the eye can see the curving arcade of hillside is lined with row after row of crypts each with its concrete headstone emblazoned with a large red star a name and an inscription.Long Chaogang and Bai Tianrong though had both been here before. The two men veterans of China's war with Vietnam which began with intense combat in mid-February of 1979 return from time to time looking for lost friends. And for more than an hour this day they climbed up and down the deserted mountainside near the Vietnam border searching in vain through the names of the 957 soldiers buried here stopping now and then to light a cigarette and place it on a tomb in offering to a comrade.The silence that prevails here disturbed only by a gentle breeze rustling through the cemetery's bamboo groves is fitting for a war that is being deliberately forgotten in China. By official reckoning 20000 Chinese died during the first month of fighting when this country's forces invaded Vietnam in the face of spirited resistance and untold others died as the war sputtered on through the 1980's. There are no official estimates of Vietnamese casualties but they are thought to have been lower.Sixteen years on China has produced no "Rambo" much less a "Deer Hunter" or "Platoon." There have been a few movies novels and memoirs about the suffering of the soldiers and their families. But no searing explorations of the horror or moral ambiguity of war. There are no grander monuments than cemeteries like these found mostly in this remote border region. China in short has experienced no national hand-wringing and has no Vietnam syndrome to overcome.

 365,  2017, a, To the Editor:Re “How Immigration Helps Canada” by Jonathan Tepperman (Op-Ed June 28):My grandparents had no special skills when they came to this country. They were poor and uneducated. They came from Russia and Poland because their religion limited their opportunities and put them at risk of death. Their children went to public schools and universities in New York and prospered.I would like to think that our family has been an asset to this country. The Canadian immigration system favored by Mr. Tepperman is rational but cold and selfish. We welcome immigrants and refugees because that is what a decent moral society does.We should ask those who are fleeing abuse and death not what they can do for us but what we can do for them.KEITH S. HELLER NEW YORKTo the Editor:Lest Jonathan Tepperman become too smug and self-righteous in extolling Canada’s immigration policy he would do well to examine Canada’s sins.

 1888,  2008, a, Democratic incumbents with large African-American constituencies are trying to soothe resentments incited by their support for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Raymond Hernandez reports.For example Brooklyn’s 10th Congressional District home to more African-Americans than any other district in New York gave Senator Barack Obama his highest margin of victory in the state. But the district’s longtime congressman Edolphus Towns did not share his constituency’s preference for Mr. Obama and now some of those voters are pushing to oust him.An emerging young black political class is seeking to assert the neighborhood’s power against what it sees as an older establishment based in Harlem that has long exercised disproportionate influence in New York.The tensions in the district echo those in a handful of races around the country. Even after Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton embraced in Unity N.H. last Friday and sought to put their divisions behind them some strains are still evident closer to the ground.A Shortage of Bicycle ParkingAt a time when the number of people cycling in New York is soaring one glaring problem for those who want to bike to work is the shortage of parking Colin Moynihan reports.In a city inhabited by bike thieves so crafty and notorious that the bicycle lock company Kryptonite calls one of its locks the New York Fahgettaboudit many people are loath to leave a bike chained outside where it can be stolen or quickly stripped of parts.Some commuters who park on the street try to throw off thieves by choosing a different spot each day or by moving their bike during lunch. Others depend on the good will of local business owners who might be willing to squeeze a bike into a shop corner at no charge.Even for those willing to park outdoors space is limited. Although it is common for people to secure bicycles to signposts or parking meters it is a violation of a city ordinance to lock a bike to anything other than a bicycle rack. In addition many businesses and buildings post signs warning cyclists not to chain their bikes to fences or railings.Bloomberg for Vice President (Times Two)Clyde Haberman in his About NYC column asks: Why don’t both presidential candidates make Michael R. Bloomberg their running mate? After all nothing in the Constitution seems to prohibit it.“There’s nothing about parties in the U.S. Constitution to begin with” said Nathan Persily a law professor at Columbia University.Richard H. Pildes a law professor at New York University said the main impediment might be state bans on “fusion candidacies.” This is an alien concept in New York but most states have laws forbidding candidates to run under the banner of more than one political party.But do those prohibitions apply to national candidacies? The situation may vary from state to state Professor Pildes said. Also “the vice presidency is such a weird thing because you don’t vote separately for the vice president” he said. A credible argument he suggested might be made that any bans on fusion candidacies might not apply in this situation “since we’re really voting for the president.”Now would Mr. Bloomberg move into the vice president’s official residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington or continue to bunk at his Manhattan town house as he does now?Real Estate and DevelopmentThe memorial to the people who died on Sept. 11 will not be open in time for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack as had been previously announced.

 110,  2019, a, BEIRUT Lebanon — Iranian officials reacted with unified irritation on Thursday to the Trump administration’s decision to sanction Iran’s foreign minister calling the move petty and provocative — further evidence they said of Washington’s insincerity when it talks of peace.The foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif an American-educated diplomat who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal that President Trump rejected last year is one of Iran’s best-known leaders and perhaps its most effective in making his country’s case to the West. The sanctions imposed on Wednesday could make it more difficult to engage in the new diplomacy that Mr. Trump says he wants.With Iran and the United States locked for months on the brink of armed conflict Iran’s leaders are often viewed as split between hard-liners who urge confrontation and moderates like Mr. Zarif who support diplomacy.But Western analysts see the punishment of Mr. Zarif as the latest in a series of signs that the Trump administration is itself deeply divided over the right approach to Iran — and that despite Mr. Trump’s insistence that he wants to negotiate his most hawkish advisers are not interested in diplomacy.
 136,  2019, a, michael barbaroFrom The New York Times I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”[music]Today just three US presidents have confronted the possibility that members of their own party would support their impeachment. Only one left office because of it. My colleague Natalie Kitroeff talked to White House reporter Peter Baker about what to expect this time. It’s Tuesday October 1.natalie kitroeffPeter walk us through the extraordinary circumstances of the only time a president facing impeachment left office under pressure from his own party Richard Nixon.archived recording (richard nixon) I refer of course to the investigations of the so-called Watergate affair.peter bakerWell this of course was two years into Watergate. There had been investigations for many many months.archived recording (richard nixon) I believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other investigations of this matter to an end. One year of Watergate is enough.peter bakerAnd Nixon had basically survived it up until this point and Republicans largely stayed with him. What really finally did him in what finally put things over the edge was something they call the “Smoking Gun Tape.”archived recording What did the president know and when did he know it? On July 16 Alexander Butterfield a former White House official shocked the Senate Watergate Committee by saying the president’s conversations were on tape.peter bakerAnd this particular tape of a conversation showed that Nixon in fact had ordered his aides to tell the C.I.A. to block the F.B.I. investigation into Watergate.[music]archived recording (richard nixon) And because these people are plugging for — for keeps and that they should call the F.B.I. in and say that we wish for the country — don’t go any further into this case period.peter bakerIn other words he had directly ordered the cover-up. That was a bridge too far. For the Republicans that was the final straw.archived recording Congressman Rhodes and Senator Scott and I have just concluded a visit with the president.peter bakerThere is this dramatic moment when three senior Republicans from Congress Barry Goldwater John Rhodes Hugh Scott they come to the White House and they tell Nixon —archived recording We have told him that situation is very gloomy on Capitol Hill and that it is a very distressing situation.peter bakerIt’s over. The time is up. He no longer has enough support to survive. He’s not only going to be impeached by the House but convicted by the Senate. He probably only has 10 Republican senators who are still willing to stand with him. That’s when they abandoned him. And it’s only at that point did they abandon him —archived recording (richard nixon) I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.peter bakerWhich of course prompted him to resign. Rather than face the humiliation of impeachment and conviction by the Senate he would short circuit the process in effect by saying I give up. I’m out of here.archived recording (richard nixon) To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president and the Congress.natalie kitroeffSo obviously there’s a lot of similarities to that moment and the one we’re in now. You could argue that we have the proverbial smoking gun with the transcript that the White House itself released last week of Trump’s call with the president of Ukraine. So why doesn’t it seem like the same thing is happening now?peter bakerRight. In fact you heard House Democrats when they read that rough transcript of the phone call say it was a smoking gun. They used that term “smoking gun.”archived recording That is the smoking gun. I personally think that that document is the smoking gun. We should not be trying to find a secret smoking gun. Donald Trump is the smoking gun.peter bakerEvoking the Watergate parallel. What you didn’t hear was a lot of Republicans say it.archived recording This was a normal conversation between two leaders and we’ve got the president of Ukraine saying there was no pressure.peter bakerMost of the Republicans said no I don’t think this tells us enough about the president’s interactions with Ukraine to suggest it was somehow nefarious. He simply made a request that the Ukrainians investigate corruption. There’s no quid pro quo.archived recording No quid pro quo no talk about aid. archived recording (richard nixon) No quid pro quo. The Democratic chairmen themselves said there was no quid pro quo here.peter bakerQuid pro quo of course would be if you do this I’ll do that or if you don’t do this something will happen or not happen.archived recording (lindsey graham) From my point of view to impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane.peter bakerSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who’s one of the president’s closest allies said —archived recording (lindsey graham) This seems to me like a political setup. It’s all hearsay. You can’t get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistle blower didn’t hear the phone call. archived recording Right. archived recording (lindsey graham) Who told the blower about the phone call and everything else?peter baker— There was no there there. It was a nothing burger. He said it would have had to have been the president talking in kind of more of a thuggish voice threatening the president of Ukraine that would have changed his mind. But since he didn’t he said that there’s nothing there to call a high crime and misdemeanor.archived recording What do you make of this exchange?peter bakerYou know Kevin McCarthy who’s the House Republican leader said on 60 Minutes.archived recording (kevin mccarthy) President Zelensky says we are almost ready to buy more javelins from the United States for defense purposes. And President Trump replies “I would like you to do us a favor though.” archived recording He just added another word. archived recording (kevin mccarthy) No it’s — archived recording He said I’d like you to do you a favor though? archived recording (kevin mccarthy) Yes. It’s in the White House transcript.peter bakerHe tried to correct the interviewer as to the wording of the transcript and in fact didn’t realize what it actually had said: “I want you to do us a favor though.” And Kevin McCarthy didn’t know that the word “though” had been in there and certainly hadn’t fixated on it anyway as a particularly meaningful piece of evidence.natalie kitroeffThe difference here is that the smoking gun is not quite as smoking as it was in the case of Nixon.peter bakerRight. Yeah exactly. Exactly. Anyway it hasn’t been seen by both parties in the same way that the Smoking Gun Tape was seen in 1974.natalie kitroeffSo how does President Trump’s approach to all of this compare to Nixon’s?peter bakerWhen the Smoking Gun Tape came out in 1974 Nixon takes the hint. Rather than face the humiliation of impeachment and conviction by the Senate he would short circuit the process in effect by saying I give up. I’m out of here. And 25 years later when Bill Clinton faced impeachment —archived recording (bill clinton) I did not have sexual relations with that woman Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie not a single time never.peter bakerHe absolutely refused to resign. A lot of Democrats would have liked him to. They were very unhappy with what he had done. They thought he had brought shame to the office and had damaged the party.archived recording (bill clinton) I will continue to do the work of the American people. We still after all have to save Social Security and Medicare for the 21st century.peter bakerBut Clinton showed something different. He showed that if you just simply stick it out if you simply aren’t ashamed if you don’t let embarrassment or ridicule or constant battering drive you out that you can probably bluff your way into holding onto office.archived recording (bill clinton) I have accepted responsibility for what I did wrong in my personal life. The question is what are we going to do now?peter bakerAnd Clinton said basically to Congress I dare you. Try it. Try to take me out because you can’t.natalie kitroeffSo if you’re Trump and you’re looking at that history there’s a strong case for following Clinton’s lead not Nixon’s and being defiant in the face of all this pressure.peter bakerYeah that’s exactly right. In fact you know I wrote a book about Clinton’s impeachment called “The Breach.” And while I was doing the research for it I interviewed a couple Republicans who had been pretty key in investigating Watergate — Howard Baker who was the senator and Fred Thompson who was the Republican counsel. And both them told me in separate interviews something I was really struck by. They both said that if Nixon had followed Clinton’s example and refused to quit he may never have been removed that in fact if he’d actually gutted it out and called the Senate’s bluff he might still have won the day. And I think that shows you how much has changed since the 1970s in terms of our politics and particularly the politics of impeachment.natalie kitroeffPeter it feels worth noting that what you’re pointing out is that the congressional process has never actually removed a president during impeachment. We think of the Nixon story as an example of bipartisan action on this but it wasn’t quite that.peter bakerThat’s exactly right. In the end Nixon gave up. And the question is whether in today’s political environment whether there could ever be a moment where a two-thirds majority in the Senate that would have to compose members of both parties would ever agree to remove a president. Up until now anyway the American public has not been interested in an impeachment of President Trump. That may be beginning to change. CBS in fact over the weekend. They found that 55 percent of Americans now support impeachment inquiry. And that’s the first time a majority of Americans have done that. So that changed the dynamics a little bit. But if you’re a Republican the more important number is probably the number of Republicans who support the president at this point which is still in the 80 to 90 percent range in most polls. In other words the president is still very popular with Republican core voters.natalie kitroeffSo what you’re saying is it might not matter to Republicans that much that the broader public opinion has shifted toward favoring an impeachment inquiry.peter bakerIt’s not the most important thing. I mean what’s changed in the last 20 years since the Clinton impeachment the last 40 some years since the Nixon impeachment is the parties have really become more and more homogenized so that there really are just conservatives in the Republican Party and just liberals in the Democratic Party and not a lot of people in the middle anymore and they’re running in districts where the greater threat is that you lose your seat to somebody on your flank not that you lose swing voters in the middle right? So if you’re a Republican you’re more concerned that you lose the support of conservatives than you do that you lose the support of independents or moderates. And that means that your incentive structure is to stay with a president who is popular with the core voters.natalie kitroeffCan you think of a single Republican senator who seems likely to break from the party in this moment?peter bakerI think you can imagine a scenario if the House were to impeach and if there continued to be some revelations that were damaging to the president in which a handful of Republican senators might vote against the president.archived recording (mitt romney) I did read the transcript.peter bakerYou know Mitt Romney has expressed his concern over what’s happening with Ukraine.archived recording (mitt romney) It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling.peter bakerSenator Ben Sasse has said —archived recording Quote Republicans ought not be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no “there” there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there.peter baker— that this stuff is troubling. I don’t think either one of them is at the moment ready to declare that they would be for a remove from office. But a handful of them at least would be potentially open to that possibility if the facts that presented itself. It’s hard to see 20.natalie kitroeffAnd why is that number relevant?peter bakerWell let’s just remember how impeachment works of course.[music]Impeachment starts in the House of Representatives and it requires a majority of members of the House to vote to impeach the president for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Now that’s like an indictment. It’s a charge in effect the president has committed crimes against the republic if you will. If House Majority were to pass an impeachment article against the president it then goes to the Senate. The Senate would then in theory put the president on trial. The trial would — if the Clinton precedent were to hold — bring members of the House over who had voted to impeach the president —archived recording William Jefferson Clinton has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. Convict him and remove him.peter baker— to serve as prosecutors if you will. They call them managers.archived recording Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.peter bakerAnd then the president would be entitled to bring lawyers of his own to the Senate floor to defend him.archived recording We are here today because the president suffered a terrible moral lapse of marital infidelity not a breach of the public trust not a crime against society.peter bakerAnd then the evidence would be presented and the Senate would vote. Now to actually convict the president and remove him from office would require a two-thirds vote. Now in this Senate that would mean 67 votes. Because there are in fact only 47 Democrats that means you need at least 20 Republican senators to vote to convict. Otherwise the president would be acquitted and he would remain in office for the rest of his term.natalie kitroeffAnd Peter do we know for sure that Mitch McConnell is going to have a trial?peter bakerWell that’s a great question. People have been asking over the last few days because you know he of course didn’t have a vote on Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination in 2016. Sp a lot of people say well maybe he would just simply declare that he wouldn’t take it up. But he actually just said on Monday —archived recording (mitch mcconell) Well I would have no choice but to take it up. How long you’re on it is a whole different matter. But I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.peter bakerThe Constitution doesn’t require him to take it up. The Constitution says the Senate has the power to try a president but the Senate rules do specifically say that if the house impeaches a president that the Senate must take it up the very next day. Now what kind of trial it would be we don’t know. You could open the trial and then supporter of the president’s or even Mitch McConnell himself could introduce a motion to dismiss the case on the basis that there is no evidence or not enough evidence or that that doesn’t seem likely to get to a 2/3 vote so why bother to belabor the process? You could have this motion to dismiss and then that could be passed by a majority of the Senate. And then in fact the trial would be over. They tried this during the Clinton case. It didn’t work. So there is some precedent for it. The truth is there have only been two Senate trials of a president in our history one in 1868 one in 1999. Both times they kind of made up as they went along because there is no rulebook for this. So you can imagine that we would be making it up as we go along all over again.[music]natalie kitroeffWe’ll be right back.[music]So McConnell is indicating that he’s willing to hold this Senate trial but we don’t know exactly how it’s going to go down. And in any case all signs are pointing to the Senate acquitting Trump.peter bakerRight exactly. Something drastic would have to change presumably like for instance the economy going bad the president’s poll numbers going south in a serious way not just across the board but also with Republicans. Things like that would probably have to happen in order to see such a drastic defection from the Republican caucus in the Senate.natalie kitroeffSo given those dynamics what is the G.O.P.‘s strategy for talking about this phone call and the whistleblower’s allegations to voters?peter bakerWell one thing they are trying to do is to make it out as if this is strictly a radical effort by disgruntled Democrats who never got over losing the 2016 election —archived recording They’re angry about the 2016 election and ultimately they’re angry at the voters. They’re angry that the voters elected President Trump all of this from day one. From day one they have been wanting to get this president out of office.peter baker— to in effect have a coup d’etat against President Trump. You see email after email attack after attack on individual Democrats from supporting an impeachment inquiry.archived recording Our extreme left is angry. They’re marching in the street with pitchforks and torches.peter bakerCongresswoman so-and-so has given in to the radical socialist left of her party or Congressman so-and-so is just part of a mob attack on the president. So they’re trying to turn it on the Democrats. They also of course want to focus on Joe Biden.archived recording Everywhere Joe Biden goes his son follows and gets millions of dollars from the government. The president is right to ask for an investigation.peter bakerYou don’t hear them say hey everything the president did was fine. There’s no problem here. And here’s the reason why. They prefer to attack his accusers.natalie kitroeffAnd there’s a parallel there right? With what the Democrats were saying in the late ‘90s about the G.O.P. and its obsession with Clinton.peter bakerYeah that’s exactly right. They didn’t want to go around defending Clinton. They didn’t think that Clinton was worth defending in the sense of what he had done. But they did want to attack the Republicans by saying they had gone too far.archived recording (hillary clinton) The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.peter bakerThey had caved in to the right wing extremist of their party. They were obsessed with sex and this was a wholly illegitimate effort.archived recording Mr. Speaker Republicans put your country defend your party.peter bakerSo while the subject matter of the two impeachments was starkly different some of the tone and the rhetoric you’re hearing there is some parallel.natalie kitroeffPeter it strikes me that Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats had to have known all of this would be the case when they decided to move forward with the impeachment inquiry. So why in their minds was it the right thing to do?peter bakerYeah it’s a great question because up until now Nancy Pelosi has not been interested in doing an impeachment. She was there as a member of the Congress in 1998.archived recording (nancy pelosi) We are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton and until the Republicans free themselves of this hatred our country will suffer.peter bakerDidn’t think it worked out too well for the Republicans.archived recording Tonight on C-SPAN campaign ‘98 results.peter bakerA party line impeachment didn’t help the Republicans at the polls in 1998.archived recording Democrats had a much better day than anybody would have expected a few weeks ago and if —peter bakerAnd also was seen by history as kind of somewhat less than a noble effort. She didn’t want the Democrats to be seen as partisan attackers of Trump who can’t get over their hatred of him so they impeach him. But when this one came up it just broke the dam. It’s just finally OK we’ve got to do something here and I think that the Speaker felt she had no choice but to move ahead.natalie kitroeffBut I guess what I mean is if the Democrats knew that impeachment basically never ends with a president leaving office and the idea that Trump would leave of his own volition like Nixon is highly unlikely then this impeachment story seems potentially more likely to go the way of Clinton despite the presence of what the Democrats are calling a smoking gun.peter bakerAt the moment that’s right. But the difference is that both Nixon and Clinton were in their second terms right? They were not going to serve more than a couple more years no matter what. This is the first time we’ve had an elected president in his first term facing an impeachment. So immediately after this decision the voters will have a chance to decide either because the president will be there still and they will decide whether to keep him there or because they’ll decide to throw him out or because maybe he will be removed from office and we’ll be having Vice President Pence standing up as the nominee for the Republican Party. There’s a lot of different options here. But I think that really we’re seeing something that’s different than any previous impeachment battle that we’ve seen. Voters didn’t get a chance to vote on Bill Clinton directly after his impeachment trial. They didn’t get a chance to vote on Richard Nixon at all. Andrew Johnson didn’t even get his party nomination so he didn’t run after his impeachment trial. This is the first time assuming President Trump doesn’t leave office that voters will render a judgment on a president shortly after an impeachment and a trial assuming they happen. And so I think we have transformed the conversation that we’re about to have for the next 13 months.natalie kitroeffPeter thank you so much.peter bakerThank you.[music]michael barbaroThe Times reports that President Trump pressured another foreign leader for a political favor in recent weeks. During a phone call with the prime minister of Australia Trump pushed for help to discredit the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Afterward the White House restricted access to records of the call just as it did to the transcript of the president’s July call to the leader of Ukraine. On Monday House Democrats issued their second subpoena related to that call this time to the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani seeking his private communications with the president.archived recording Mr. President do you now know who the whistleblower is sir? archived recording (donald trump) Well we’re trying to find out about a whistleblower. We have a whistleblower that reports things that were incorrect.michael barbaroAt the White House President Trump said he was eager to identify the whistleblower despite legal protections specifically designed to keep the whistleblower anonymous.[music]We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. On Monday California’s governor Gavin Newsom signed a law allowing college athletes at public and private universities to sign endorsement deals with major companies a decision that could ultimately transform the economics of college sports.archived recording Billions and billions of dollars 14 plus billion dollars goes to these universities goes to these colleges billion plus revenue to the NCAA themselves and the actual product the folks that are putting their lives on the line putting everything on the line are getting nothing.peter bakerUnder current rules such deals are prohibited a system that has allowed universities and TV networks to profit from college sports but prevented the athletes themselves from earning money.archived recording It’s going to initiate dozens of other states introduce similar legislation and it’s going to change college sports for the better by having now the interest finally of the athletes on par with the interests of the institutions. Now we’re rebalancing that power arrangement.[music]michael barbaroThat’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.[music]

 3849,  1997, a, A Federal law intended to restrict paroles for violent felons has become a stumbling block in state budget negotiations with Gov. George E. Pataki and the Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver trading accusations of dishonesty and competing interpretations of the law.Strictly speaking it is not a budget matter. The state stands to lose $24 million this year in Federal aid for prison construction if it does not comply with Federal parole guidelines passed last year that require violent offenders to serve on average at least 85 percent of their sentences. But that is a pittance next to the $635 million the Governor wants to spend this year on new prison space let alone the $66 billion budget. State officials say New York has until Tuesday night to apply for the Federal grant.Nor is it strictly speaking a matter of how much time prisoners serve. A state with prisoners serving relatively short sentences can qualify for the Federal grant if it denies all paroles while another state that grants paroles might not qualify even if its prisoners serve longer terms.Mr. Pataki a Republican insists that the state has not met the Federal standard and that it ought to deny parole to all first-time violent felons. Mr. Silver a Democrat from Manhattan says he believes that the state qualifies. And the Justice Department says the answer is unclear.

 3056,  2001, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students will explore the effect of computers and word processing on traditional forms of communication and expression.Author(s):Rachel McClain The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Write about their preference for either handwriting or word processing.2. Learn about the effect that word processing is having on the tradition of handwriting in China by reading and discussing the article “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC.”3. Create and conduct a survey in class on the effect of computer usage on traditional forms of communication and expression4. Conduct the class survey on a group within their community and create posters displaying the results.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-poster board-markers-copies of the article “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals students will respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): If your teacher gave you the option of writing an essay by hand or typing it on a computer which would you choose? What advantages does this method provide? What disadvantages might this method present? After allowing students to write for a few minutes have some students share their answers with the class.2. As a class read the article “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC” focusing on the following questions:a. How much of his writing does Mr. Li do on a computer?b. What does Mr. Li define as the trend of societal progress?c. How has writing both united and divided the Chinese?d. What Chinese phrase means the same thing as the English idiom “on the tip of my tongue”?e. How does the transliteration system “pinyin” work?f. How many characters can be associated with the typed word “ma”? What meanings do two of these characters have?g. Why can’t Ehren Fairfield spell?h. Why does Professor Xu think that the computer will prevail over the pen?3. As a class develop a list of ten questions that will be the basis of a survey about the role of computers in writing and the effect that computer usage has on traditional forms of communication and expression. Suggestions for the types of questions to include in the survey are: What percentage of your writing do you do on a computer? How many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Do you generally prefer to type something or handwrite it? After creating the survey tally the class’ responses and record them on a poster board. Then create a list of different groups of people with whom the class could conduct the survey (e.g. “people over 65” “housewives” “college students”) and how students think these responses might differ from those of the class.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In pairs students conduct the survey developed in class on one of the groups on the class list. Before conducting the survey pairs should predict the outcome of each answer based on what they know about the computer usage trends of this group of people. Students then conduct the survey and create a poster displaying their findings and comparing them with their initial predictions. Pairs report their findings to the class.Further Questions for Discussion:–What percentage of your writing do you think you do on a computer? What percentage of your parents’ writing is done on a computer?–What other cultural “traditions” can you think of that are threatened by increased computer usage?–How have computers changed your classroom experience in the last few years? Do you think this change is for the better?–What is the original quotation from which the author of the article derives her title “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC”? What does the original quotation mean?–Which do you value more: tradition or progress? Why?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated on completion of journal entries participation in class discussion and performance of surveys on computer usage in their community.Vocabulary:hazy summons anecdotal undermine pragmatic intricate neuropsycholinguist phonetically pinyin inevitability contextExtension Activities:1. Write a short story in English then translate it into Chinese characters. Transfer each version by hand to posters then have your teacher show them to the class. Can the class figure out who wrote the story based only on the Chinese version? Can they figure it out based on the English version? What does this say about the significance of handwriting?2. With a partner write a set of e-mail correspondences between a “computer savvy” person and a more “traditional” and less computer literate person. The computer savvy person’s emails should include computer slang abbreviations and typos or other grammatical mistakes (or changes) that might be found in a quickly written email. The other person’s emails should adhere strictly to correct letter format and be free of typos and grammar mistakes. Throughout the course of the exchange the more traditional partner will become more and more frustrated and confused by the other’s “improper” English.3. Learn about the role that computers play in other countries. Create a chart comparing such statistics as average number of computers per household number of computer-related jobs and average daily Internet traffic in your country China and two other countries that you researched.4. Write a dialogue between a Chinese calligrapher and a young Chinese student who is learning to write Chinese on the computer. Using the article as a reference have the characters discuss the roles of tradition and progress in Chinese society as they are impacted by the shift away from handwriting.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research the history of note-taking in the American classroom. Create a timeline depicting the standard method through which students have taken notes in the last 200 years and include a prediction of how note-taking might look in 2010.Fine Arts- Learn the art of Chinese calligraphy and create a Chinese character in calligraphy accompanied by a picture of what the character represents to be displayed in your classroom.Health- With increased computer usage for writing and research come increased health hazards. Research the dangers of overexposure to computers and create a pamphlet informing people of the dangers of overexposure to computers and the precautions they can take.Mathematics- Write a short paragraph. Have a sample of people of different ages write the paragraph by hand then type it on a computer. Record the time it takes for each person to complete the paragraph and create a graph of the average times for people of different ages. As an extra variable conduct the same test but give the original paragraph to half of the subjects in handwritten form and to the other half in typed form. Were the results different based on the format of the original paragraph?Science- Read a book on handwriting analysis then conduct your own handwriting analysis of a friend. Have a third party obtain a sample from someone you know and not tell you whose handwriting you are looking at so that you will not be biased by your prior knowledge of the person’s traits. Analyze the sample. When you are done have the person tell you whose writing it is. Did you accurately describe this person? Did you learn something new about this person through their handwriting?Other Information on the Web:Study of Chinese Writing Systems (//www.humboldt.edu/~cllc/writesys.htm) examines Chinese orthography by looking at the representation of phonograms.Web Directory: Chinese Word Lists and Online Glossaries and Dictionaries (//deall.ohio-state.edu/chan.9/cdict.htm) links to Chinese (and some Japanese) online glossaries and searchable dictionaries.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Technology Standard 3- Understands the relationships among science technology society and the individual.

 4289,  1994, a, In a move that threatens to disrupt relations the Chief Justice of Singapore rejected appeals from President Clinton today and ordered that an American teen-ager be flogged for spray-painting cars and other mischief in this prosperous order-loving city-state.The case of Michael Fay 18 of Dayton Ohio raises the prospect of a rift between the United States and one of its closest allies and trading partners in Southeast Asia and American diplomats immediately protested the decision by the Chief Justice Yong Pung How to uphold the flogging sentence.Mr. Fay has confessed to spray-painting cars and throwing eggs at other vehicles. He was sentenced to four months in prison and six lashes with a half-inch-thick rattan cane a punishment that results in permanent scars and usually sends prisoners into shock.President Clinton intervened in the case in early March describing the caning sentence as "extreme" and asking Singapore to reconsider.

 4319,  1994, a, "I bought it in a large amount initially expecting it to sell because the Elton John single is already out" said Lal Sarju the store's soundtrack buyer referring to "Can You Feel the Love Tonight." "But when the movie comes out I expect to sell a couple hundred pieces a week."Buyers at record and toy stores agree sales of the soundtrack will probably be sluggish until the movie opens but they're hoping airplay and the pre-release hype will help. "There's already been a lot of anticipation" Lew Garrett the vice president of purchasing for the 430-store chain Camelot Music said. "I think it has the potential to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. We certainly bought it that way." Beastie Boys With MonksThe Beastie Boys were the last band anyone expected to get political. The hip-hop trio's first full-length album "Licensed to Ill" in 1986 was a boy's night out crammed with tales of drinking and partying. Their most recent album "Ill Communication" (Grand Royal/Capitol) released yesterday sounds more like the morning after. It's sleepy and sprawling heavy and reflective. "The earth needs to be respected" Adam Yauch (a k a MCA) raps on "The Update." "It's been far too long that she's been neglected."On Friday night at the Academy the Beastie Boys -- Michael Diamond (Mike D) Adam Horovitz (King Adrock) and Mr. Yauch -- put their money where their mouths are. The surprise performance announced the day of the show was a benefit for Artists for Tibet a national campaign to preserve Tibetan culture. Also on the bill were Luscious Jackson a female punk funk and hip-hop quartet that includes the former Beastie Boys drummer Kate Schellenbach and the Tibetan Ganden Jangtse Monks."I don't think most of our audience has ever seen something like the monks" Mr. Yauch 29 said from his parents' home in Brooklyn hours before the show "and I definitely don't think the monks have ever seen the kind of insanity that goes on at our concerts before. Hopefully it will run smoothly. The main thing we're hoping to do with the concert is bring about some more awareness about what's happening in Tibet especially among younger people."

 5059,  1989, a, In many respects Drexel appears to have made a pretty good deal for itself. In the first place it is expected that the firm will not be criminally charged with trading on inside information the main offense in the civil complaint that the Securities and Exchange Commission filed against it in September. Also no individuals at the firm are to be named in this settlement although an indictment of Mr. Milken and possibly others is expected this month.The investigations by the United States Attorney's office and the S.E.C. were generated by information from Ivan F. Boesky the arbitrager who is now serving a prison sentence for securities fraud. The Government alleges that Drexel engaged in illegal insider trading ''parked'' stock to conceal the owners' identities and manipulated stock prices in transactions involving takeovers.By agreeing to the settlement which does not include some of the most serious allegations Drexel will avoid a revealing examination of its practices in court. If the firm had fought and lost a criminal trial Prof. Harvey J. Goldschmid of the Columbia University Law School pointed out it would have been exposed to ''far greater civil liability and potential financial disaster.''Also the firm escaped charges under the 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act which Mr. Giuliani's office had threatened to use. The mere filing of racketeering charges would have allowed the Government to freeze Drexel's assets and made it virtually impossible for the firm to conduct business. Just as important such a step would have prevented Drexel's 1700 employee shareholders who own most of its stock from taking their equity out of the firm.Further the $650 million penalty - a $300 million fine plus $350 million to be set aside as a reserve fund to settle claims by investors and clients - is relatively small compared with the fees the firm has been reaping from its investment banking and underwriting activities. Drexel which has $2.3 billion in capital is expected to receive $230 million for its work on the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout for instance. And some of the fine is expected to be tax-deductible. If the firm continues to generate those kinds of fees the fine will have been money well spent to stay in business.
 4165,  1995, a, What will certainly prove to be one of the most inspired birthday celebrations of the dance year occurred on Tuesday night when Jennifer Muller/The Works opened its 30th anniversary season at the Joyce Theater. The program one of two to be presented during a weeklong engagement included the obligatory world premiere and a suite of excerpts from dances choreographed by Ms. Muller between 1975 and 1988. Then came "Speeds" a signature Muller work created in 1974.This group piece is a jazzy boisterous romp through a score by Ms. Muller's longtime collaborator Burt Alcantara. William Katz's white suits tunics and hats have the trademark Muller chic. And the dance courses happily along through tender fleeting duets and carefully plotted free-for-alls for a stageful of dancers. Interspersed are cross-stage lineups of slithering dancers who look like the "Bayadere" Shades gone funky. There are periodic cries of "Change" which give the dance a quaint feel. Blessedly the kinds of self-conscious stage directions dancers called out to one another in the 1970's are mostly a thing of the past.Here however there was a special poignancy and pizazz to those commands. For change was represented not only in the quick shifts of speed and dynamics that give the dance its name but also in Ms. Muller's moment of stillness in memory of deceased company members and more joyously in 10 former Muller dancers who augmented the cast for this first-night performance.Some looked as if they wanted never to leave. Others seemed a little nervous about their technique and endurance. Two in particular -- Young Soon Kim and Ed Burgess -- looked as if they should not have left. Mr. Burgess's lithe all-out dancing and expression of happy triumph were the highlight of the evening.

 105,  2019, a, Climate change made the stifling heat that enveloped parts of Europe last week much more likely and hotter researchers said Friday.The heat wave the second to hit Europe since late June set temperature records in Paris as well as in Germany the Netherlands and other countries. Nuclear reactors in France and Germany were forced to reduce output or shut down because the water used to cool them was too warm.The hot air which was trapped over Europe after traveling from northern Africa lingered for about four days. It has since moved north over Greenland causing the surface of the island’s vast ice sheet to melt at near-record levels.Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd: our email newsletter.World Weather Attribution a group that conducts rapid analyses of weather events to see if they are influenced by climate change said that for France and the Netherlands the four days of extreme heat last week were a rare event even for a warming world. But it said climate change had made the heat wave at least 10 times more likely. In Germany the heat wave was at least eight times more likely because of climate change the group found and in Britain where the heat did not linger as long it was at least two times more likely.
 4372,  1994, a, WHO has the top Top 10 list?On this side of the field is Lehman Brothers. Every July since 1949 Lehman has offered up a list of 10 best stocks for the next 12 months. But last year Shearson Lehman split up and while Lehman retained rights to the list -- Ten Uncommon Values -- Smith Barney which got Shearson felt heir to the tradition too. So in July it suited up a rival portfolio -- Ten Exceptional Names -- and yesterday ended the new contest's first quarter.The results dividends and commissions excluded: Lehman Uncommons over the Smith Barney Exceptionals 14.1 percent to 13.5 percent.But both teams strongly outpaced the S.& P. 500 up just 4.15 percent. The disparity is not unusual. Many brokerage firms have best-buy lists and they often outdo the market said Rick Chrabaszewski of Zacks Investment Research. In 1990 these lists' 7.25 percent loss trailed the S.& P. 500's loss of 3.1 percent for instance but their total returns of 50 percent in 1991 20.24 percent in 1992 and 19.6 in 1993 consistently outdid the 500's respective returns of 30.5 percent 7.6 percent and 10.1 percent.And the two Top 10 lists smaller than most best-buy rosters are among the pickiest of picks. Lehman's 10 Uncommons are culled from 300 buy recommendations which are themselves drawn from the 1000 stocks Lehman follows. Smith Barney's Exceptionals come from the 180 high-rated buys among the 1200 securities it tracks.

 1253,  2012, a, PhotoSUNDAY’S PUZZLE — We see a lot of letter addition or deletion themes here at The New York Times puzzle enclave and they can go one way or another: sometimes they’re really clever and sometimes we’re left with a distinct feeling of “seen that before.” LO and behold I thought this one was clever.Steven E. Atwood returns with a theme that inserts the word “LO” into common items or phrases and they all worked very well in my opinion. My favorites were SLALOM DANCING a pun on the 1970s punk style of slam dancing and GLOAMING TABLE a pun on gaming tables. I had to look up SOLON but FAVORITE SOLON for favorite son was cute as well.In “Really Embarrassing Misparsing” news it took me a while to understand what the rocker Adam Ant had to do with being “unyielding.” Haha silly me: it turns out the answer is actually ADAMANT. Not ADAM ANT. Anyway if you don’t remember Mr. Ant here he is at his most popular:I thought that “Source of northern exposure?” was a very clever clue for the CBC as well.Let’s end our solving week with a little FOO Fighters:Your thoughts?
 4387,  1994, a, The chairmen of three regional telephone companies said today that they planned to spend at least $300 million starting a video programming venture with the Creative Artists Agency raising questions about the agency's growing power in Hollywood.The venture would mark the largest effort by the Baby Bells to compete against cable systems by using phone lines into homes to allow subscribers to call up entertaiment. The venture hopes to reach nearly 20 million customers over the next five years. Today's announcement also solidified the powerful standing in Hollywood of Michael Ovitz chairman of the Creative Artists Agency who was hired by the Baby Bells to shape the enterprise.Mr. Ovitz's role in the venture seems to be far more muscular than even critics suspected. The announcement said that Mr. Ovitz and his agency C.A.A. would develop marketing strategies for new programs as well as assisting the new company "establish relationships and assemble programming from the broadcast networks cable programmers studios artists and producers." C.A.A. will also advise on "executive staffing business development and entertainment industry alliances."Mr. Ovitz's role in the venture has stirred considerable concern among some top movie studio executives who said that the powerful agent was walking a delicate line between representing talent on the one hand and helping create shows and programs on the other hand that could give him enormous and unfair advantage over rivals. "Yes we are concerned and we've expressed our concern to him and we're watching this very carefully" said the chairman of one of the major film studios.

 4775,  1991, a, CARNEGIE HALL 1960 At 17 I came to New York. The dormitory Was higher than most buildings I'd ever Been in. I ate in a coffee shop Where people never looked at you Went on a tour of Bellevue Because it was a place like Lindy's Or the Metropolitan Museum of Art So legendary that being there was magic. Some New York kids I met said "Let's go to Carnegie Hall." From Standing Room We looked down at the Philharmonic And their TV-star conductor jumping Up and down on his podium all creating Wonderful noise that filled the place And vibrated to the roots of my hair. The things you could take for granted in New York! -- LEWIS GARDNERON one of those frequent rainy April mornings Rose E. Baker of Woodlawn N.Y. is dashing to work wearing her nurse's whites. Glancing down the subway stairs she sees copper-colored water swirling at the bottom step. She hesitates for a moment or two considering whether to suffer wet feet all day or to retreat. Just then a man in high rubber boots approaches her."Do you want a lift?" he asks.At first Ms. Baker does not quite understand his question. But then the fellow turns his back bends over and says "Hop up!" She does and rides piggy-back all the way to the turnstile.Delighted to have dry feet but embarrassed nevertheless she thanks him profusely. He nods and moves on to the second flight of stairs. When Ms. Baker peers down she sees still more flood waters and her subway Sir Raleigh waiting on the bottom step.

 2343,  2005, a, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised the city's public hospitals yesterday asserting that the quality of care they provide is so good that poor New Yorkers receive better medical service than wealthy patients at private hospitals. Speaking at an interfaith prayer breakfast at the New York Public Library the mayor was extolling the virtues of living in New York City when he mentioned the quality of service offered by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. He said the city's public hospitals and medical centers "are something I am so proud of.""This city has 11 public hospitals and every rating agency says these are the best hospitals better than the great teaching hospitals we have in this city" Mr. Bloomberg said. "Medical care in this city is arguably one of the few services you can point to any place in the world where the poor get better services than the wealthy. It really is true. If you get sick you go to a public hospital. Every single number shows we've done a spectacular job."Mr. Bloomberg's enthusiasm has been on display before and health care is a favorite topic of his. Amid budget cuts elsewhere he increased city funds for public hospitals and he has contributed millions of his personal fortune for a school of public health at his alma mater Johns Hopkins University.But his claim that the city-run hospitals are superior -- and that as a result their mostly poor patients receive better care than people who go to private hospitals -- proved difficult to test. Yesterday being observed as a holiday officials at several large private hospitals were not available to comment. Nor were federal officials who collect Medicare and Medicaid data.

 697,  2015, a, “Partisan” in title at least carries a whiff of the wild history of the Balkans. There is a postwar air to the opening scenes of Gregori (Vincent Cassel) salvaging pieces of broken furniture. He already has mattresses. Lots of mattresses. And eventually a compound with a harem of weirdly trusting women devoted to being baby machines despite Gregori’s lack of personal magnetism.In a wavering accent that is sometimes Borat sometimes generic American game-show host and sometimes Christopher Walken (as himself and as “S.N.L.” ’s Continental) Gregori lectures his growing brood educates them and teaches them to shoot using balloons as targets. He is training them to defend against “the outsiders” he says but never specifies what they have to fear.Usually partisans stand for something but in this movie which is stripped of a specific time frame and relevant geopolitical context the term becomes hollow. The screenwriters Ariel Kleiman (who is also the director) and Sarah Cyngler have cut their story loose from any real significance leaving us with Gregori who has no discernible political views and no unifying beliefs even delusional ones. Without this foundation for the character the actor doesn’t stand a chance. As a cult leader he is full of grand gestures but as aimless as a tiny plastic man in a terrarium.Eventually he sends the children on assignment as assassins. The teenage Alexander (Jeremy Chabriel) goes on the job equipped with baby blue cotton balls as ear plugs. As adolescent boys should he begins to question his elders. What have his targets done — the shopkeepers and mechanics he is sent to kill? Why should they die?

 3944,  1996, a, I.B.M. made another big bet yesterday that its future depends on becoming a supplier of software and services for computer networks by agreeing to purchase Tivoli Systems Inc. for $743 million.As corporations increasingly cut payrolls they are trying to enable fewer people to do more work by giving them powerful personal computers on office desktops and linking the machines together. Tivoli is a small but fast-growing specialist in making software for managing these networks of PC's.This new model of computing called client-server is intended to cut costs and improve efficiency by allowing the easy sharing of information. The International Business Machines Corporation made a huge acquisition in the network field last year when it bought the Lotus Development Corporation for $3.5 billion.Lotus's Notes software is a leading program that lets workers share documents and files in computer-linked teams. Tivoli makes software that helps keep these complex client-server networks up and running. In client-server technology individual users or clients are "served" over a network by a central machine that acts as a common repository of information and programs.

 5485,  1987, a, To the Editor:Your criticism of United States departure from the United Nations General Assembly during the speech by the Iranian president (Topics Sept. 24) misrepresents diplomatic practice and United Nations history. The walkout by Herbert S. Okun deputy United States representative leading the delegation was justified. It was Iran that broke the rules. Neither United Nations practice nor diplomatic convention requires a country to sit still for personal diatribes against its chief of state open threats of terrorism or appeals for the naked use of force. President Ali Khamenei did all of that and more.Further your comparison of the walkout to Soviet boycotts of the Security Council is incorrect. When the Russians walked out of the Security Council in 1950 they stopped participating in its work. The United States is participating fully in the work of the General Assembly. We returned to our seats as soon as the Iranian speech ended. FREDERICK NEGEM Counselor Press & Public Affairs New York Sept. 24 1987

All of the injured were taken to hospitals and all except for one firefighter who is being held for observation at Bellevue Hospital were released. A Bellevue spokesman would not specify the fireman's injuries last night but said his condition was stable.The accident took place about 2:30 P.M. the Fire Department spokesman said when two trucks responding to a fire at 387 Grand Street collided at the intersection of Grand and Essex streets. Both trucks were from the same firehouse but only one was traveling to the fire from the firehouse said the spokesman who would not give his name or identify the fire company.
 103,  2019, a, WASHINGTON — President Trump struck an agreement last week to require thousands of Central American migrants to seek asylum in Guatemala before coming to the United States. But the White House ceremony to hail what the president called a “landmark” measure — one that could transform the American immigration system — almost did not happen.Just two hours earlier Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had criticized the agreement in a closed-door meeting with Mr. Trump and Kevin K. McAleenan the acting secretary of homeland security and several other aides according to three senior administration officials briefed on a debate that ensued in the Oval Office.Mr. Pompeo called the agreement flawed and a mistake and he told Mr. Trump that the Guatemalan government did not have the ability to carry out its terms said the three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate deliberations.Mr. McAleenan pushed back according to two of the officials. He argued that the accord like similar ones in Europe would stem the flow of immigrants which has so infuriated Mr. Trump.
 682,  2015, a, PhotoRead all of our “Narcos” recaps.Season 1 Episode 9: “La Catedral”“Narcos” has shown us the two faces of Pablo Escobar both of which are terrifying but revealing in contrast. One is introduced most effectively in the very first episode with Escobar calmly thwarting an attempt to shut down one of his trafficking routes. He doesn’t need to show anger or break out the heavy artillery. All he does is identify each and every officer on the scene and talk to them about their families; they’re welcome to stop this shipment he’s so brazenly carried out into the open but there will be consequences.In this episode we see a second face. Escobar flies into a rage driving the base of a pool cue repeatedly against the head of a longtime associate he suspects of betraying him. It’s perhaps the single most vicious act of violence on a show with plenty of contenders but it’s also a sign that Escobar’s position has dramatically weakened from where we started. Escobar built an empire on calculated violence the need to make good on threats in order to intimidate his enemies and protect his business. Impulsive violence of the kind seen in this episode however has no tactical value. It’s just killing.It’s a bit odd thinking of a mass murderer like Pablo Escobar as a “flawed hero” type but one of the show’s consistent strengths has been its effort to step back and evaluate Escobar’s genius and hubris — and the thin line separating one from the other. At no point has he been unwilling to kill people and there’s no evidence here that’s he’s ever shown a second of remorse about it. But “Narcos” suggests that Escobar’s failure to gain legitimate political power in Colombia was a breaking point for him and he never quite recovered. His cohorts in the Medellín cartel blame his political ambitions for engaging the government in the drug war and sabotaging a thriving business but that doesn’t explain the real problem with Escobar: He’s an entitled hothead. He lashes out at the bureaucrats who denied him a seat at the table. He lashes out indiscriminately at the populace when he doesn’t get his way on extradition. And he lashes out at longtime associates for bristling at the exorbitant “tax” he demands in exchange for them running his business.“Narcos” reveals a pattern of violence linked to Escobar’s temperament. When he responds to extradition threats by blowing up a plane his earth-scorching violence backfires; when he starts specifically targeting the family members of Colombia’s elite he gets the political concessions he wants. His mistakes haven’t limited his ability to murder people at will but they have backed him into a corner. Getting the government to concede to his own prison (“Club Medellín”) was an undeniable victory but it’s only a fleeting one because he’s too paranoid and angry to exercise power the way he did in the past. He scans for signs of disrespect like a beachcomber with a metal detector jumping at every stray bottlecap. The Escobar of old would have calmly assessed the likelihood of his trusted partners having nothing to do with the millions dug up on their property. This Escobar feels the threat of the Cali cartel taking over and the possibility of turncoats within the Medellín cartel as power is siphoned away from him. His answer is self-defeating rage.Escobar’s temper is mirrored this episode by Murphy’s who’s letting his own long-term engagement in the drug war cloud his judgment. It’s nothing like beating a man to death with a pool cue but Murphy pulling his gun on a taxi driver after a fender bender — with wife and orphaned child in the car no less — reveals his own deteriorating judgment in the face of enormous stress. More important it’s the first time Murphy has legitimately crossed the line on the show. His actions in the club shootout could be justified because they got Poison one of Escobar’s most vicious sicarios; his choking of the truck driver in this episode could be justified because they need to force him into taking pictures of the goodies being delivered to Escobar’s prison fortress. But this is Murphy flying off the handle. It’s not nearly enough to put him on the wrong end of the “good and bad are relative concepts” continuum but the needle moves a little.The needle stands to move a lot more if Murphy and Peña engage the Cali cartel further in their effort to nab Escobar. The enemy of their enemy may be their friend for now but eliminating the kingpin of one cartel so the kingpin of a rival cartel can take over his territory is a short-term victory that promises long-term déjà vu. When the prime directive is to get Escobar however Drug Enforcement Administration agents like Murphy and Peña are not responsible for thinking too hard about how the drug war over all will be affected by the hunt. They’ll catch him however they can.Parting shots• The peace that comes to Bogotá after the government’s concessions to Escobar is worth noting lest we believe Gaviria to be a weak-willed coward unwilling to stand up against a bully. For a country ravaged by narco-terrorism the trade-off of Club Medellín is sensible. …• … so long as photographs of Escobar’s luxury prison don’t happen to surface in the news media. For Gaviria this is when a concession for peace becomes a woeful political embarrassment.• Wagner Moura has been terrific as Escobar all season but never better than the moments before he unloads on one of the men he’s entrusted with running the business. Those eyes that twitching of the arms — if he were a cartoon character smoke would be coming out of his ears.• Talk of a tunnel under Escobar’s prison compound can’t help but recall Joaquín Guzmán Loera the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo who recently escaped from prison via tunnel. The tunnel was a mile long 5.5 feet tall and lighted and ventilated for easy travel. No word on the contents of El Chapo’s jailbreak Spotify playlist.Read our recap of the season finale here.

 7446,  1964, a, A strike that would have shut down almost all Broadway theaters today was prevented last night when Mayor Wagner succeeded in getting actors and producers to continue negotiations after their contract expired at midnight.Following a meeting with representatives of Actors Equity Association and the League of New York Theaters at Gracie Mansion Mr. Wagner announced at 8 P.M. “We have not been able to come to any agreement.” But he said that the two sides had agreed to his request that they extend negotiations for a new contract until 5 P.M. Thursday. Any settlement said the Mayor will be retroactive to last midnight. The participants will hold their next joint session at Equity's offices today at 10:30 A.M.The union according to Frederick O'Neal president of Equity is seeking a 14 per cent increase over the present weekly minimum wage of $117.50 and rehearsal pay equal to the minimum. The rehearsal pay is now $97.50 a week. The increase would bring minimum salaries over four years to $150.Mr. Wagner's personal intervention in the negotiations came in the form of two ses‐ sions at his East Side home. At 1:10 P.M. he met with Equity and league spokesmen for less than an hour.

 5538,  1986, a, Search teams sent remote-controlled cameras to the ocean floor today to determine whether an unidentified sunken object discovered by the Coast Guard is a large piece of wreckage from the space shuttle Challenger.The underwater search is taking place about 40 miles east of Daytona Beach in the same area where the Coast Guard Thursday recovered five large floating pieces of the shuttle itself including a clearly identifiable section of the right side of the fuselage adjacent to the crew compartment.On that section the word ''Rescue'' was clearly visible along with a yellow arrow pointing to a small hatch door to be used by the crew for escape in emergency landings at land or sea. The door is below the mid-deck section of the crew compartment only about six feet from where Gregory B. Jarvis a mission specialist on the flight was seated.No Word on Sunken ObjectMr. Jarvis was one of the seven people aboard the Challenger who died Tuesday when it exploded in a fireball over the Atlantic shortly after it was launched here.

 6073,  1977, a, ISLAMABAD Pakistan. July 2 (AP)—Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and opposition party negotiators agreed today on a plan for new elections designed to quell four months of political unrest.Spokesmen for the two sides said that the agreement now must be approved by the central council of the opposition Pakistan National Alliance but that a formal version could be signed within two days.The agreement is intended to end the upheaval that began after the March 7 national elections when the alliance charged that Mr. Bhutto's ruling Pakistan People's party had rigged the voting. More than 300 people died in anti‐Govornment rioting after the election and major cities were placed under martial law.The alliance negotiator Ghafoor Ahmed said that a formal version of the pact if approved by the central council would be signed by Mr. Bhutto and the alliance leader Maulana Mufti Mahmood.

 688,  2015, a, Recientemente un grupo investigadores declaró que la literatura médica exagera los beneficios de la terapia hablada para tratar la depresión en parte porque los estudios con resultados mediocres rara vez se publican en las revistas médicas.Su análisis es el primer esfuerzo por incluir los ensayos clínicos no publicados sobre dichas terapias. De acuerdo con este análisis tratamientos como la terapia cognitivo conductual y la terapia interpersonal sí son efectivos pero aproximadamente en un 25 por ciento menos de lo que se creía anteriormente.Desde hace mucho tiempo los doctores saben que los artículos de las revistas médicas exageran los beneficios de los antidepresivos casi en la misma medida y en parte por las mismas razones: el sesgo en la publicación científica a favor de los descubrimientos alentadores. La nueva revisión publicada en la revista especializada PLOS One podría dar a médicos y pacientes una mejor idea de lo que pueden esperar de las distintas formas de terapias habladas dicen los expertos y tal vez poner fin a los debates que siempre han existido en el campo de la psiquiatría sobre los méritos relativos que dan prioridad a un tratamiento sobre otro.Los estudios revelan que entre cinco y seis millones de estadounidenses reciben psicoterapia para tratar la depresión cada año y la mayoría también toman antidepresivos. Los expertos confirman que la mayoría de las personas encuentran algún alivio tan sólo con ver a un especialista y hablar del problema. La participación en un tratamiento de resultados comprobados aumenta un 20 por ciento la probabilidad de lograr una mejoría aún más satisfactoria o una recuperación duradera según los nuevos análisis. Antes de incluir las investigaciones no publicadas esa cifra era cercana al 30 por ciento y esta diferencia sugiere que es menos probable que cientos de miles de pacientes reciban algún beneficio.El nuevo artículo es el último capítulo en un amplio atrincheramiento en las ciencias en el que los investigadores están examinando resultados anteriores para eliminar posibles sesgos de publicación y otras manipulaciones estadísticas más deliberadas.“Necesitamos considerar seriamente la publicación de todos los estudios completados” ya sea a favor o en contra comentó Jelte Wicherts profesor asociado en el departamento de metodología y estadística de la Universidad de Tilburg en los Países Bajos quién no participó en el estudio.Otros investigadores advirtieron que el análisis estaba lejos de ser la última palabra sobre la efectividad de la psicoterapia. “El número de pruebas que analizaron fue muy poco representativo y no diferenciaron entre enfoques de psicoterapia” expresó Stefan Hofmann profesor de psicología de la Universidad de Boston.En el estudio el equipo encabezado por Ellen Driessen de la Universidad Libre de Ámsterdam buscó todas las subvenciones otorgadas por los Institutos Nacionales de Salud para financiar ensayos clínicos sobre la terapia hablada en casos de depresión entre 1972 y 2008. El equipo encontró 55 la mayoría de los cuales usaron metodologías de manual; es decir que el terapeuta y el paciente utilizan un manual estandarizado como guía en el tratamiento.Las terapias más comúnmente estudiadas son la terapia cognitivo conductual en la que las personas aprenden a identificar y desactivar suposiciones automáticas y autocríticas como “Soy desafortunado en el amor” o “Siempre me ahogo” y la terapia interpersonal que busca replantear las interacciones personales. Por lo general estos estudios se hacen con sujetos que participan durante tres o cuatro meses en sesiones de una hora a la semana con un terapeuta.Los investigadores descubrieron que 13 de esos estudios financiados se llevaron a cabo pero sus resultados nunca se publicaron; generalmente porque sus autores pensaron que los hallazgos que no ofrecían beneficios tenían pocas posibilidades de ser publicados. El equipo contactó a cada uno de los 13 investigadores y les solicitaron sus datos. Cuando esos datos se incluyeron con los datos de los artículos publicados la eficacia de las terapias cayó significativamente cerca de una cuarta parte.“Esta cifra una cuarta parte parece ser el número mágico: es la misma que comúnmente aparecen en los ensayos farmacéuticos” de antidepresivos comentó Erick Turner coautor del estudio profesor asociado de psiquiatría de la Universidad de Salud y Ciencias de Oregon y autor principal del artículo de 2008 que detalla el sesgo en las pruebas clínicas de esos medicamentos.El equipo no contó con suficiente información sobre los diseños de los estudios originales para determinar si los autores manipularon los datos para que un tratamiento se viera mejor de lo que era como ocurrió en algunos de los ensayos de medicamentos. De haber estado disponibles los diseños del estudio expresó Turner los beneficios de la psicoterapia habrían sido menores. Sus coautores fueron Steven Hollon de la Universidad de Vanderbilt Claudi Bockting de la Universidad de Groningen Pim Cuijpers de la Universidad Libre y Driessen.Según Hollon los resultados muestran que la eficacia de los medicamentos antidepresivos y las terapias habladas es modesta y la combinación de ambas es mejor que cualquiera de ellas por sí solas. No obstante para aquellos que tienen buenos resultados o se recuperan totalmente “la psicoterapia en especial la terapia cognitivo conductual parece ser la más efectiva para reducir el riesgo de una recaída en el largo plazo” comentó Hollon.Los hallazgos del nuevo informe no sorprendieron a muchos terapeutas que recurren a la terapia hablada. “La depresión es un trastorno difícil de tratar y es muy difícil también juzgar los tratamientos pues los síntomas de la depresión por su naturaleza presentan altibajos. Estamos ante un blanco en movimiento. Hay un sentimiento de desesperación porque necesitamos algo nuevo y hay muy pocas opciones en el horizonte” dijo Hofmann.Sigue a NYT América en Facebook y Twitter para leer más artículos de The New York Times en español.
 2291,  2006, a, After talking about chess in my previous post I have decided to continue the trend and not write directly about the extraordinary Formula One race that we all got to see today – at least I hope you did since it was sensational as Schumacher showed that he is far from losing his talent even as he retires.While not present in China I was in France for the go karting world championships – also organized under the aegis of the FIA – and I found it to be yet another interesting thing to compare to Formula One. At one end of the spectrum there’s a Formula One and chess world championship that seem to get out of control but at the other end of the spectrum karting is riding high…yet unfortunately heading toward the same exclusivity as Formula One.Spectators watching the karts at the world championship karting race at Angerville this weekend. Listen to these karts Spectators watching the karts at the world championship karting race at Angerville this weekend. Listen to these karts by clicking here. (Brad Spurgeon)In fact walking through the paddock at the track in Angerville this weekend at the 43d karting world championships it almost felt like I was walking through a Formula One paddock. Same security with a closed off paddock accessible only to the few with passes attributed and with drivers so busy and deep in concentration that talking to them was almost impossible. Many of the faces were also the same as in Formula One.“Karting is Formula One in miniature” said Franck Lagorce who was there as the leader of the team of French drivers.And indeed it was. In fact who should I run into but Nicolas Todt the son of the Ferrari director Jean Todt. Nicolas is also the manager of Felipe Massa and a director of the title-winning GP2 team. Nicolas was attending the kart race to watch over another of his drivers Jules Bianchi who was racing in Formula A the highest level of karting. Patrick Tambay the former Formula One driver was there with his son Adrien. Former Formula One driver Jan Lammers’ son Bas was there racing as well. And I recognized one or two people from Bridgestone who are usually in the Formula One paddock but priorities brought them to the karting track to take care of the tires.(I didn’t recognize any of the engine people though but decided I’d stick my minidisc recorder’s microphone out along the main straight and record some engine sounds as the karts passed. So you can click here and listen to the engines and practically see the karts pass before your eyes as the spectators did on the same straight pictured in the photo above since the recording is in stereo.)Finally I should mention that in a way this miniature Formula One weekend turned into a “real” and not a “virtual” paddock for one of the readers of this blog Pierre-Etienne Bost who maintains the excellent blog de course. Pierre-Etienne and I met on Sunday for the first time and spent the afternoon in the paddock.Pierre-Etienne Bost right in the paddock beside the kart of Mark Bumgarner a racer from the Philippines. Bost maintains the Pierre-Etienne Bost right in the paddock beside the kart of Mark Bumgarner a racer from the Philippines. Bost maintains the blog de course blog. (Brad Spurgeon)And to round out the theme of the karting being all about the future of Formula One some things work by way of the past as well. Pierre-Etienne pointed out to me that Adrien Tambay’s kart bore the same sponsor that his father’s cars did in Formula One: Moulin Rouge.Like the Formula One race the final of the karting world championships was raced on Sunday on a wet track. Just minutes before the start it began to rain very heavily and the race was delayed by five minutes as many drivers had to put rain tires on including Bianchi who was starting from second on the grid. It then stopped raining but with a soaked track Bianchi got off to a great start and led the race gaining a massive lead lap after lap just as Fernando Alonso did in Formula One in the morning. But Bianchi 17 like Alonso then found himself in trouble and on the fifth lap he was passed by Davide Fore the 32-year-old Italian former world champion. He then abandoned the race on lap 7 with a technical problem.Fore led until with seven laps left another Italian Francesco Antonucci passed Fore and won the race and the world karting title. It was his first world title and he started the race on the fifth row.Spectators watching as a truck karts a crashed kart off the track just like in Formula One. (Brad Spurgeon) Spectators watching as a truck karts a crashed kart off the track just like in Formula One. (Brad Spurgeon)As soon as Formula One has a boring race it is criticized for being a boring formula. Often the critics say that the drivers should all have the same material and it would not be so boring. But today in this world championship kart race the highest level of the lowest form of motor racing there was no comparison at all: today’s Formula One race was much more exciting.This is not to denigrate a three-day weekend of fun and exciting qualifying races leading up to the final race. Its 15000 spectators had an excellent final race and a great weekend of karting entertainment – especially those who had the privilege of being able to go into exclusive Formula One-like the paddock. In fact it wasn’t all new to Pierre-Etienne who used to race karts at a regional level in France and who said the paddock did not used to be so exclusive even a few years ago.
 3811,  1997, a, Makoto Namba a world-class match racer and an America's Cup skipper who became the first Japanese sailor to break into the top 10 in the world ranking fell overboard during an ocean race on April 23 and is presumed lost at sea off Japan. He was 46.The Japanese Coast Guard conducted an air and sea search for 72 hours to no avail.At the time of the accident Namba was skipper of the 45-foot yacht Escape One which was competing in the Sail Osaka '97 a 1500-mile sailboat race from Hong Kong to Osaka Japan. His team of 12 crew members was leading the 40 boats in the competition said Emili Miura a spokeswoman for the Japanese America's Cup syndicate Nippon Challenge.She said that Namba was steering the boat at dusk when a 20-foot wave crashed into the yacht and pitched him into the water. ''Unfortunately he did not happen to be wearing either a life vest or safety harness'' she said.Namba held on to the boat for a few seconds before losing his grip and disappearing into the high seas and dim light she said. None of the crew members was lost or injured.

 5735,  1985, a, ''The trouble with most raspberry jam'' says Rose Levy Beranbaum ''is that it has too much sugar in it and if you try to cut back on the sugar the pectin won't jell the jam.''But Mrs. Beranbaum whose cooking school Cordon Rose specializes in pastries and chocolate was undaunted by the prospect of creating a low-sugar jam without any added pectin. Pectin is a carbohydrate that occurs naturally in some fruits such as apples and causes a gel to form when the fruit is cooked. Raspberries do not have the natural pectin to turn them into preserves without a little help from powdered pectin.Mrs. Beranbaum wanted a jam in which the tartness and fruitiness of the berries was not masked by the sugar so she turned her kitchen into a laboratory and set to work. It took her only three attempts -over a three-year period - to perfect the technique. It produces a jam that is intensely fruity and very tart so tart that some people might be inclined to add a bit more sugar. Mrs. Beranbaum says that will not affect the intense berry flavor because her cooking method concentrates it.Required: Time and a SieveAlthough the technique is quite different from ordinary jam-making it is not difficult. It does however take time. Batches of the fruit are cooked down combined with the sugar syrup and cooked again. Because the berries become so concentrated it is important to sieve the jam and eliminate some of the seeds; they can be used to make raspberry vinegar.
 4140,  1995, a, Among other scenes he did not choose to recall aloud were those of Haitian refugees adrift at sea as their rulers spent months mocking American threats and the violence that broke out in the streets of Port-au-Prince last fall even as American soldiers looked on.Instead Mr. Clinton sought to make indelible a vision of a United States putting its power to good service. From the steps of the gleaming National Palace and from the side of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who had sent Mr. Clinton and his predecessor into fits of exasperation over what they saw as his uncooperativeness in exile the President declared that the American-led mission "has been accomplished and with remarkable success.""Today we come together as friends" Mr. Clinton told the citizens of a country whose plight has for so long confounded American leaders.Even last September as he sent American soldiers back to Haiti for the first time since F.D.R. Mr. Clinton always described their objectives as limited. In a Haiti that is still desperately poor and much less than stable -- despite an operation that has cost $900 million since United States soldiers landed on Sept. 17 he was careful to repeat those cautious words today.But with Republicans in Congress outspoken in their criticism of peacekeeping missions and with public opinion polls showing tepid support for American involvement here the President also transformed his appearance into a kind of emblem.He recalled the doubts that were raised last summer as his showdown with Haiti's military leaders reached its crucial point and he made clear that he had no doubt that he had chosen the proper course."Seven months ago the world wondered whether the United States could summon the will to protect democracy in this hemisphere" Mr. Clinton told the soldiers this morning. "Now the world knows once again that the United States will honor its commitment and stand up for freedom."

 5943,  1982, a, Will the real Democrat please stand up? That is the question dominating the Democratic primary in Florida's Fourth Congressional District. That contest will be decided in a runoff Tuesday by the voters of this seaside-and-citrus region in the northeastern corner of Florida.The incumbent is Bill Chappell Jr. a seven-term member of the House who votes consistently with the Southern conservatives who have provided President Reagan with his margin of victory in a number of Congressional votes and are thus known as ''boll weevils.''The challenger is Reid Hughes a wealthy businessman and environmentalist who criticizes the Reagan economic program cuts in social programs and rapid increases in military spending.Test of Reagan AppealMr. Chappell led by a narrow margin in the first primary last month but failed to win a majority and was forced into a runoff. The outcome is being watched by political insiders in Washington and around the country because it is expected to offer a good test of the electorate's attitude toward the Reagan economic program.

 5597,  1986, a, Federal officials say that rabies is now widespread in Maryland and Pennsylvania and they fear its steady advance will reach the suburbs of Philadelphia in a year. The same outbreak of the disease has also reached epidemic proportions in South Carolina Georgia and Florida.The East Coast epidemic is one of two in the country. Another carried by skunks has spread the disease from Texas north to Minnesota and from Kentucky west to the Dakotas according to the Centers for Disease Control. In addition rabies is common in bats in much of the country.There were 5599 confirmed cases of rabid animals in the country last year according to the centers more than twice the 2675 reported in 1975. So far this year 2382 cases have been reported which the Centers for Disease Control said was slightly ahead of last year's rate.Dr. Fishbein attributed part of the rise however to better reporting and record-keeping.As the disease spreads into more densely populated areas however contact between rabid animals and humans is becoming increasingly common. These are among recent incidents:* A 15-year-old girl was bitten in the leg in March by a raccoon while sitting on her porch in Hanover Pa.* More than 30 people were exposed when they played with a rabid kitten on two farms in Frederick County Md. The kitten also bit a New Jersey woman at a gift shop through her boot. Health officials conducted a vast but unsuccessful search for the woman whose name was not known to the officials.* A 6-year-old boy was bitten by a groundhog while waiting for a school bus in York County.* An 87-year-old man was bitten by the family's pet donkey in central Pennsylvania. The man and all emergency room personnel who helped treat his deep wound had to be vaccinated.Such incidents have caused alarm in the region's tiny towns whose residents rarely vaccinate their pets and often allow them to roam. Local officials report an increase in the number of abandoned animals and at least one case of what they described as ''panic.'' Group Forms to Get Cat

 3310,  2000, a, To the Editor:I appreciate your June 30 editorial ''Mr. Nader's Misguided Crusade'' acknowledging the political power of Ralph Nader and the Green Party. But before you declare him a spoiler consider that he has already won a partial election victory.This week when Al Gore proposed an energy plan with a light-green tint he no doubt pulled a few votes from the Nader camp. If Mr. Gore can keep going and co-opt the Green Party positions on campaign reform labor issues and world trade he just might take enough votes from Mr. Nader to win the election. And I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Nader declared such an outcome a victory exonerating himself of charges of egotism.GLENN CHENEYHanover Conn. June 30 2000
 1953,  2008, a, Today’s qualifying session for the Brazilian Grand Prix went pretty much as predicted with one exception: Jarno Trulli.How big an influence will the Italian’s unexpected position in second place on the grid have on the result of the world championship battle tomorrow?It was expected that the Ferraris would likely make it to the top two spots. It was expected that the McLaren Mercedes would be in third and fourth with Lewis Hamilton ahead of his teammate Heikki Kovalainen and those two did perform in that manner – but with Trulli landing in between the two contending teams.Trulli on Thursday had a 39 degree temperature and flu. He stayed in his hotel and received treatment from the Toyota team doctor that brought him back into a condition to drive a perfect lap. But how will he behave in tomorrow’s race? Trulli has never been the best of drivers in a crowd. It was only one race ago in China that he and Sebastien Bourdais had a coming together at the start. If they all go into side by side to that tight left hand first corner what might happen?“I race for myself and I race for my team and I race for points” said Trulli in the post qualifying press conference. “From experience I know that I don

 1116,  2012, a, Mark Lennihan/Associated PressMorgan Stanley which has not had much joy in a rough year for Wall Street had reason to celebrate on Wednesday.As the lead underwriter on Facebook’s initial public offering the firm will reap not only millions of dollars in fees but more important the bragging rights that come with what bankers described as a once-in-a-generation event.At Facebook it had been clear for some time that Morgan Stanley would help shepherd the company to the public markets.The Wall Street firm had led the prominent I.P.O.’s of LinkedIn Groupon and Zynga. And Michael Grimes the leader of Morgan Stanley’s office in Menlo Park Calif. had steered the firm’s tech team through the dot-com bust and forged relationships with the venture capital firms that have incubated today’s tech giants.So a vexing question for Facebook executives as they prepared to go public was: What sort of role should go to Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley’s chief rival in winning I.P.O. assignments?Goldman’s reputation has taken serious hits in recent years. A series of events from a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in 2010 that accused the firm of creating a mortgage product that was intended to fail to Goldman’s handling of a $1.5 billion investment in Facebook itself last year have led to criticism of the firm.Facebook executives say people briefed on the matter weighed how the bank’s record might affect its own reputation. So while many people still expected Goldman to be the runner-up among underwriters it was JPMorgan Chase that took the No. 2 spot in the Facebook prospectus’s listing on Wednesday.It was surprising given that JPMorgan is relatively untested in leading technology I.P.O.’s but helps illustrate the firm’s rise in recent years. The bank had played a full-court press to win over Facebook with its chief executive Jamie Dimon forming a rapport with Facebook’s chief operating office Sheryl Sandberg. The bank’s top deal-maker James B. Lee Jr. meanwhile regularly led pitches to Facebook executives.One advantage was JPMorgan’s strength as a lender having helped create a credit facility that provided Facebook with ample cash.Still the banks were in the dark about whether they stood in Facebook’s good graces until a few weeks ago. Three other firms round out the underwriting syndicate so far: Bank of America–Merrill Lynch Barclays Capital and Allen & Company.In a show of support for their prospective client bankers from the top three underwriters had set up Facebook accounts despite firm policies banning the use of social networks at the office.“This is a great thing for people’s tech practices” Peter Falvey a managing director at Morgan Keegan said. “It’s such a unique asset and such a highly anticipated offering that it has significant franchise value.”Such is Facebook’s prominence that banks are willing to work for a much lower fee than usual. The company is expected to pay its advisers a fee as low as 1 percent of proceeds raised according to a person briefed on the matter. That would be far below the norm of 3 to 7 percent though the size of Facebook’s offering guarantees a still-handsome payout.That low fee is reminiscent of what General Motors paid in its “re-I.P.O.” in the fall of 2010: an eye-popping 0.75 percent. There however the selling shareholder was the federal government.With an expected valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion Facebook will be among the biggest companies to seek the public markets in recent memory. Recent trades on Sharespost a secondary market for Facebook stock valued the company at as much as $89 billion.Even with a fund-raising target of $5 billion — a preliminary figure that will almost surely grow over time — Facebook’s offering is more than twice as big as Google’s $1.9 billion initial offering nearly eight years ago.The road to landing a coveted underwriting role began years ago according to people briefed on the matter. It meant forming relationships with Facebook’s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg who viewed Wall Street bankers with some skepticism.It also meant winning over top executives like Ms. Sandberg and Facebook’s finance chief David Ebersman who would oversee the I.P.O. process. Bankers also courted influential Facebook investors like James W. Breyer of Accel Partners and Yuri Milner of DST Global.Bankers and analysts had long assumed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the front-runners. Together the two firms underwrote nearly 14 percent of I.P.O.’s worldwide last year raising $22.3 billion in proceeds for their clients according to data from Thomson Reuters. Goldman ranked first with 54 offerings that raised $11.9 billion.Yet within Silicon Valley Morgan Stanley has a nearly matchless reputation. In making their pitch to Facebook to be lead underwriter Morgan Stanley bankers promoted their firm’s ability to sell huge amounts of stock through its retail brokerage network — an ability that appealed to Facebook according to a person briefed on the matter.Goldman had its own cards to play having also worked on Groupon and Zynga. It also led a $500 million investment in Facebook last year and sold an additional $1 billion worth of stock to wealthy foreign private clients. But the latter led to embarrassing questions about potential securities regulation violations hamstringing Goldman’s efforts.Evelyn M. Rusli contributed reporting.

 4892,  1990, a, An Enemy of Esthetic BoundariesLike many of his contemporaries including such artists as Vito Acconci Siah Armajani and Kim MacConnel he was concerned with dissolving esthetic boundaries in particular the one between the fine and the decorative arts. The art historian Robert Rosenblum said of him yesterday: ''Scott was as singular and unique as a person as he was as an artist. His fiercely laconic work destroyed the boundaries between furniture and sculpture between private delectation and public use and radically altered the way we see many 20th-century masters including Gerrit Rietveld and Brancusi.''Mr. Burton's own sculptures which could be used as tables and chairs when they were not on exhibit often infused the plain abstract forms of Minimalism with a sense of utility history and wit. To accomplish this the artist drew on his wide knowledge of furniture - a passion since childhood -both modernist and vernacular 19th and 20th century.He was inspired by tensile chairs and tables of Rietveld the Dutch De Stijl designer who like Piet Mondrian specialized in simple geometries and primary colors. Further inspiration came from the round stone table and stools that Constantin Brancusi created as a memorial for the fallen of World War I in Tirgu Jiu Rumania. But he also took ideas from Art Deco designs the common American lawn chair as well as rustic or Adirondack furniture made from bark-covered tree trunks and branches. Among his favorite tactics was the unexpected use of luxurious materials. One work combined galvanized metal with mother of pearl; another a table made of pink onyx was lighted from within.Formal Study in High SchoolMr. Burton was an only child born in 1939 in Greensboro Ala. to Walter and Hortense Moberly Burton. His parents separated when he was quite young and in 1952 he moved with his mother to Washington. There his interest in art led him to study informally with the painter Leon Berkowitz while still in high school. Shortly after graduation from high school he also studied for a time at Hans Hofmann's painting school in Provincetown.Uncertain that his passion for furniture and design could ever lead to an artistic career he turned to literature obtaining an B.A. from Columbia in 1962 and an M.A. from New York University in 1963. By the mid-60's he was working regularly as a freelance critic for Art News then under the editorship of Thomas B. Hess.

 3128,  2001, a, Lehmann Maupin39 Greene Street SoHoThrough June 16Jeffrey Vallance's second New York solo show is disappointing. The hilarious drawings and collages he showed here in 1999 revealed this veteran California subversive to be an expert and zany cartoonist a funny and engaging writer and a perversely assiduous student of popular religions. This exhibition restricts the free play of his goofy enthusiasms.The main event is a trio of life-size wax figures made by a professional fabricator Victor Hugo. One is a satin-robed figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Another represents President Richard M. Nixon whose image Mr. Vallance claims to have found miraculously reflected in the eyes of a Mexico City Virgin of Guadalupe. Mr. Vallance has also detected images of evil clowns in the markings on the Shroud of Turin; a collage in the show documents his being rebuked by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights for publishing this discovery the artist's respectful explanation of his motives and the league's retraction of its rebuke.The third wax figure represents the poet Dante. A gallery release says he was included ''because of the immense influence the 'Inferno' has had on Vallance's life and work.'' Right.All of this is amusing to think about but it lacks the idiosyncratic energy of a drawing titled ''The Devil Hates Good Art'' in which a portrait of Satan is surrounded by terms indicating artistic qualities he objects to including talent and mastery eccentricity sincerity and uniqueness.

 3211,  2001, a, To the Editor:Anthony Lewis (column Nov. 30) argues that citizens do not understand the ''dangerous breadth'' of President Bush's executive order empowering military tribunals to dispense justice to noncitizens. What seems more dangerous to me is the strange notion that protection under the Constitution somehow extends to noncitizens.That sort of logic leads one to conclude that every person on earth is both bound and protected by the Constitution. In addition to devaluing United States citizenship that argument makes virtually all our military actions illegal and threatens our national sovereignty.ERIK A. LUCKEYBremen Ga. Nov. 30 2001
 58,  2019, a, The Tribeca Film Festival has added a free screening of John Singleton’s breakout movie “Boyz N the Hood” to its lineup. The filmmaker died Monday after suffering a stroke.The movie about three black teenagers growing up amid gang violence in South-Central Los Angeles made Singleton then 24 the youngest person and the first African-American nominated for a best directing Oscar. The movie debuted in 1991 as the police beating of Rodney King dominated headlines.Singleton “filled his characters’ lives with warmth and humor even as they were constantly menaced and often destroyed by violence” the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote in an appraisal of the filmmaker's work. “He infused familiar coming-of-age and gangster-movie tropes with a rare authenticity.”The director “accomplished what all creators strive to. He entertained but also inspired a generation of audiences” Jane Rosenthal a co-founder of the festival said in a statement. “We want to celebrate him as we consider the legacy that he has left behind.”

 5398,  1987, a, The Feld Ballet will be presenting its first ballet by George Balanchine - the high-spirited ''Tarantella'' - during the company's two-week spring season which begins Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. And there will be a new work by Carolyn Carlson the former Alwin Nikolais dancer who currently directs her own dance company in Paris. But for Feld fans the highlight of the season promises to be the revival of his ''Tzaddik'' created in 1974 and last seen in New York 10 years ago. Performed to Aaron Copland's ''Vitebsk'' the dance is one of Eliot Feld's richest works drawing on the choreographer's memories of the rituals he watched as a child in synagogue.Daniel McCusker left New York in 1985 to direct the Ram Island Dance Company of Portland Me. He returns for a rare New York engagement opening on Friday for three performances at St. Mark's Church. A former member of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company Mr. McCusker makes pieces that seem to be a matter of luminous abstract dance. But they shimmer with poignant subtexts conjuring images of lives and the places and times they were lived.''Vantage Points'' a new work set to music by David Friedman doesn't sound like an exception. The program will be completed by ''Story'' an atmospheric dance with a breakneck solo for the choreographer.Pina Bausch will likely always be a controversial figure in American dance. For those who wish to add a little light to the heat there is a slide-lecture ''An Exploration of the New Esthetic: The Magnetic German Tanztheater'' presented by Claudia Jeschke. Highlights and current trends in German neo-Expressionist theater and dance will be explored in the free lecture sponsored by Goethe House New York and the Dance Collection Performing Arts Research Collection Monday at 6 P.M. at the Bruno Walter Auditorium Library of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.

 6130,  1977, a, Mr. Carter told the crowd that Mr. Humphrey had touched his family's life in “strange and delightful ways” and recalled his daughter Amy sitting in the Senator's lap dribbling moist brownie crumbs. He said he also remembered that when Mr. Humphrey learned that Lillian Carter the President's mother was serving in the Peace Corps in India the Senator arranged for her to be visited by the head of the Indian Peace Corps. “Who brought her very good fifth of bourbon” the President added.Before the dinner about 150 of the guests went to an early-evening reception at the Mondales’ official residence a big Victorian mansion in northwest Washington There near a crackling fireplace in a high‐ceiling parlor lined with modern art Luci Johnson Nugent daughter of former President Lyndon B. Johnson looked around at a crowd of familiar faces and said: “It's like old times.”Senator Humphrey was not among the reception guests but dominated the conversations of those who did attend. “It has been a dream of his for a long time to put that institute together” said Patrick O'Connor a Minnesota lawyer. Mr. Mondale on a receiving line with his wife Joan said he thought the Senator's appearance at the dinner would be difficult but rewarding. “I'll tell you what gives him the lift” the Vice President said. “He very much wants to make his papers available to students and scholars.”Asked earlier In the day if he had not been made uncomfortable by the continuing stream of tributes and testimonials the Senator said simply “This statement from the 23d Psalm expresses my view iully‐.My cup runneth over.”Forty states had proclaimed Dec. 2 as Hubert H. Humphrey Day and people from all 50 states filled the International Ballroom for the $1000-a-plate dinnerAlthough the Senator is recuperating from his latest series of chemotherapy treatments for inoperable cancer of the pelvis he nevertheless helped with organizing things.He had nothing to do with the menu of Cornish game hen and bananas flambe he said but the rest of the evening bore the imprint of his hand for he had consulted daily about plans.

 1245,  2012, a, PhotoAs erratically enjoyable as it is consistently ridiculous the martial arts pastiche “The Man With the Iron Fists” is the latest evidence that the vogue for neo-exploitation cinema shows no sign of flagging. Directed by the hip-hop impresario turned would-be auteur RZA (a k a Robert Diggs) of the group Wu-Tang Clan “Iron Fists” is a sweetly sincere lightly cheeky gloss on the film genre wuxia (“martial chivalry”) and those entertainments known for their flying swordsmen (and women) crouching tigers hidden dragons and often fabulous hair gowns and wirework. This is a movie as drenched in genre love as it is in the arterial spray from its hordes of sliced and diced characters.It can be hard to separate knowing neo-exploitation cinema from just plain dreck and really there seems little point in doing so. Once upon a time so-called respectable films opened in certain theaters and the putative dross of the type churned out by the producer Samuel Z. Arkoff opened elsewhere. Those divisions between high and low are long gone demolished by vanguard directors like Dennis Hopper and more recently by filmmaker-pasticheurs like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez who draw on exploitation cinema as enthusiastically as they do on classic Hollywood and art film. The apex of their geek fandom was Mr. Tarantino’s “Death Proof” and Mr. Rodriguez’s “Planet Terror” which were packaged in the United States as a double feature titled “Grindhouse.”Photo“The Man With the Iron Fists” is like those films the progeny of a deep cinephile passion if rather shakier filmmaking skills. Shot in China though as supremely artificial-looking as a Hollywood (or Hong Kong) backlot it mostly takes place in a fictional feudal town Jungle Village at the juncture of King Hu and Sergio Leone filmmakers whose shadows loom heavily over the movie. It’s here that Western name actors notably Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu rub elbows and clashing accents with Asian talent like Daniel Wu and Gordon Liu in a knotted story involving the usual mad grab for power and gold. Lucy Liu plays Madam Blossom who runs a flamboyantly amusingly smutty pinked-up brothel packed with smiling lovelies who look like an Orientalist fantasy by way of Victoria’s Secret.In a misguided move RZA has cast himself as the narrator and story hub a character known with a touch of wit only as the Blacksmith. A hardworking soul the Blacksmith makes weapons for the local warring clans squirreling away his money so that he can leave town with Lady Silk (Jamie Chung). The Blacksmith’s pungent history — told in flashback and buoyed by a brief appearance from Pam Grier — could itself be spun off into a separate movie. It’s an obviously pivotal role that should have real juice. But RZA with his sleepy eyes and an affect so laid-back it’s a wonder he can remain standing for minutes at a time is too recessive a screen presence to make the character pop much less hold your interest.To his credit he has tapped some professional scene stealers including Mr. Crowe and a diverting ByronMann as Silver Lion a gaudy baddie with heavy-metal hair and a psycho grin. Mr. Crowe who swans about as a rogue called Jack Knife looks amused throughout and it’s no wonder since about all he has to do is bed multiple women and gut an occasional foe in a movie that can feel like a private party. Which in some ways it is: Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu appeared in Mr. Tarantino’s epic “Kill Bill” to which RZA contributed music. Mr. Tarantino has returned the favor by lending his brand to “Iron Fists” as its “presenter.” RZA wrote the movie’s screenplay with Eli Roth of “Hostel” franchise notoriety who appeared as the bat-wielding American soldier in Mr. Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds.”It’s a small fanboy world after all.“The Man With the Iron Fists” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gore galore.

 1299,  2011, a, Daniel Acker/Bloomberg NewsYahoo is in talks to shed its 35 percent stake in its Yahoo Japan joint venture possibly handing over control to its partner Softbank people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Tuesday.Any deal between Yahoo and Softbank is unlikely to be a straightforward sale of the stake and could instead take the form of a spinoff of some kind said these people who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.No deal is imminent these people said adding that talks are continuing and may still fall apart.Representatives for Yahoo and Softbank were not immediately available for comment.The talks are taking place as Yahoo struggles to determine its future. The Internet pioneer has increasingly found itself outpaced by newer faster-growing rivals like Google and Facebook and has lagged in efforts to expand in hot new areas like social networking and group buying.Yahoo’s discussions raise some questions about what the company may do with its roughly 40 percent stake in Alibaba. But these people cautioned that Yahoo isn’t contemplating any sale of its holdings in Alibaba one of China’s most prominent Internet companies.Softbank owns a stake in Alibaba as well.Softbank’s chief executive Masayoshi Son previously hinted to DealBook that he would be interested in eventually striking a deal with Yahoo over the stake.“Our interests and her interests do not necessarily contradict each other” he said referring to Yahoo’s chief executive Carol A. Bartz. “Sooner or later we will have a win-win situation.”News of the talks was first reported by Reuters.

 4134,  1995, a, Federal regulators are proposing an unusual method to provide more educational television for children: broadcasters will be forced to carry up to five hours of educational programming a week but stations can pay other stations in their areas to do the job for them.The idea which the Federal Communications Commission will formally propose on Wednesday is the latest and perhaps the strangest attempt yet by the Government to promote social improvement by invoking the marketplace's self-interest.Under the plan television broadcasters would be forced for the first time to carry a minimum amount of educational programming for children -- three hours a week initially and an increase to five hours after several years. But these requirements would be "tradable" so that a station could comply with the law by paying another station in the same city to carry all but one of those extra hours.The proposal resembles a Government program in which companies that generate air pollution can trade "pollution credits" among themselves as a more flexible way to meet clean air requirements.

Judge Kaye has been called twice but was never picked to serve on a jury. Last summer MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI became the first New York City mayor in memory -- if not history -- to sit on a jury.Yesterday Mr. Spencer's name was checked off a very long list. Then he and other potential jurors were told about routine courtroom procedures. Mr. Spencer said he and his group were excused after an hour and a half but were told that they might be called back today.

 2389,  2005, a, They asked for policy details and all results since the N.F.L. began testing for steroids. The league began testing for steroids in 1987 and started random year-round drug testing in 1990. The committee is not asking for the identities of individual players -- 44 are known to have been suspended for testing positive -- but it is asking for the number of players tested and the number of positive tests for each drug.Tagliabue promised full cooperation. The N.F.L. has one of the toughest steroids policies in professional sports and recently announced it wanted to toughen its program to Olympic standards.The letter to the N.F.L. was the first in a series of letters that will be sent to the other sports organizations as early as Monday Robert White a spokesman for the committee wrote in an e-mail message yesterday.Davis and Waxman also wrote in the letter to Tagliabue that the committee would hold additional hearings at an unspecified time. They had previously said they would consider additional hearings after the March 17 hearing at which the retired slugger Mark McGwire refused to answer questions about whether he had used steroids and members of Congress criticized baseball's new steroids policy."As the committee has stated publicly numerous times its focus on the issue of performance-enhancing drug use in sports is not limited to professional baseball" Davis and Waxman wrote to Tagliabue. "The hearing was the first in a series for the committee as part of its ongoing investigation into steroid policies for professional and amateur sports."
 4412,  1993, a, JEAN HARRIS IS ONE BUT MANY REMAINWhile Governor Cuomo granted clemency to Jean Harris who has served 12 years for the slaying of her lover other women incarcerated for killing the men in their lives -- most of them in a single act of violence after years of brutal physical abuse -- remain behind bars. In New York as across the country advocates for battered women are urging a re-evaluation of the harsh sentences usually given women who kill or assault the people who have abused them. A1. NEW YORK CITY EMPIRE GRANTED RATE INCREASEThe Cuomo administration granted a large rate increase to Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield the state's largest health insurer presenting 1.4 million New Yorkers -- many of whom cannot get coverage from commercial insurers -- with increases in premiums that will average 25.5 percent. The increases are to take effect immediately though hope of a state-financed bailout remains. A1.FEUD EXPLODES AT CITY HALLA long simmering but little noted feud between two of the Dinkins administration's top officials -- First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Barbara J. Sabol who heads the city's vast social services bureaucracy -- has worsened.

 3653,  1998, a, But when a company like Hotmail with no real revenue to speak of is sold for $400 million other companies may feel like failures in comparison -- even when they are sold for three to five times the amount their investors put into them.In the pre-Internet days a return of five times invested capital would have been terrific. But venture capitalists like myself will be judged not only by the absolute dollars we return to our investors or the internal rate of return on the capital invested but against our peers many of whom have seen $2 million investments turn into $1 billion in value in three to five years -- thanks to those runaway stock prices.This unrealistic comparison threatens the foundations of one of the most remarkable constructs of a capitalist economy. The business of venture capital providing growth financing to entrepreneurs in exchange for equity in fledgling or semi-established companies can be a superb engine of economic growth creating an enormous number of jobs and fueling an entrepreneurial spirit essential to a healthy economy.But when a company with no visible means of support let alone a plan to generate revenue sells for $400 million even normally sharp-witted venture capitalists lose their minds. In a mad scramble they start outbidding each other to provide capital to what they hope will be the next Hotmail. So what? Who gets hurt? The entrepreneurs.I know one chief executive who has worked day and night for three years to build his Internet software company. He has suffered through all of the dysfunction and pain of nurturing a start-up. This year in the first full year of selling his product his company is the No. 1 or No. 2 player in the market (depending on which research report you believe) he has more than 1200 customers and has expected annual revenues of $3.5 million to $4 million. And he may turn cash flow positive sometime in the fall. Not bad by anyone's measure right? Wrong.He thinks he has failed. Given the economics of the software industry the likely exit scenario for this company is a sale to another software company. The likely price will be somewhere just below $50 million. But if that happens the chief executive told me he will have failed.And so will his investors. After three or fours years of work he will walk away with ''only'' $2 million to $3 million. And the investors will see a return of ''only'' 200 percent to 300 percent. So to avoid the perceived failure he will probably choose to hang on longer than he should in pursuit of a market that simply may not be big enough to support his enterprise as a stand-alone company. And he and his investors instead of cashing in will sit at the table too long and possibly walk away with nothing.John Doerr a much better-known and wealthier venture capitalist than I is often quoted as saying that the Internet represents the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. So far Internet stocks seem to be proving him right. For my part I just hope he is not the yardstick against which we will all be measured.

 4059,  1996, a, Edmund Debler an analyst with Mehta & Isaly said he expected Sangstat to grab 10 percent of the cyclosporine market which he estimated would total $2 billion by the year 2000. ''We think they're going to sell it at a reduced price'' he said suggesting that Sangstat might sell a year's supply of the drug for $3000 compared with Sandoz's price of $5000. But he added ''you've got to figure Sandoz will throw up some road blocks along the way.''Sandoz officials could not be reached for comment. But analysts agreed that the company would fight hard to protect cyclosporine its most profitable drug. In the United States and Europe there are more than 200000 organ transplant patients who must take immunosuppressive drugs daily for the rest of their lives. The majority of these patients take cyclosporine which is one of the 10 biggest drugs worldwide in revenues.Philippe Pouletty Sangstat's chairman and chief executive said that the company fully expected stiff opposition from Sandoz but that it had the wherewithal to compete on more fronts than price alone. ''Being a transplant-only company dedicated to the field with 12 products in our pipeline more than Sandoz or anyone else we have the means to compete'' he said. ''We're not a generic company; we're a transplant-dedicated company.''Under F.D.A. regulations however Sangstat's cyclosporine will be reviewed as a generic drug which means it must only show that it is therapeutically equivalent to the existing product rather than having to demonstrate long-term safety and efficacy. The so-called A.N.D.A. (abbreviated new drug approval process) should be more rapid than a full review but analysts said the F.D.A. might feel no urgency because there already was an effective drug on the market.Sangstat is also anticipating clinical trial results on another transplant drug Thymoglobulin which is intended to block acute kidney rejection. Dr. Pouletty said the company will report results of that trial in October and if they are favorable could apply for marketing approval early next year. Sangstat recently started the Transplant Pharmacy which will make its drugs available to patients directly by mail circumventing established drug distributors.

 5149,  1989, a, George Bell drove in three runs two with a home run that extended his hitting streak to a club-record 22 games as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Chicago White Sox this afternoon 5-1 to complete a sweep of a three-game series.And when Baltimore lost to Cleveland 11-0 later today the Blue Jays moved into a tie for first place with the Orioles in the American League East. The victory was Toronto's ninth in 10 games.Bell's hitting streak is the longest in the American League this season. The homer was his 16th of the season and it brought the sellout crowd of 49422 to its feet. The fans would not sit down until Bell obliged them with a curtain call.Dave Stieb (14-8) was the winner. Tom Henke who pitched the ninth struck out one giving him 40 strikeouts in his last 25Y innings. Steve Rosenberg (4-10) lost in his second complete game of the season.

 516,  2016, a, MONTEGO BAY Jamaica — Jamaica has long bemoaned its reputation as the land of ganja.It has enforced draconian drug laws and spent millions on public education to stem its distinction as a pot mecca. But its role as a major supplier of illicit marijuana to the United States and its international image — led by the likes of Bob Marley whose Rastafarian faith considers smoking up a religious act — have been too strong to overcome.Now its leaders smell something else: opportunity.Having watched states like Colorado and California generate billions of dollars from marijuana Jamaica has decided to embrace its herbaceous brand.Rather than arresting and shunning the country’s Rasta population the Jamaican authorities will leverage it. Beyond decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana last year Jamaica has legalized the use of medical marijuana with its ultimate sights set on “wellness tourism” and the font of money it could bring.And for good reason: Jamaica has one of the lowest economic growth rates in the developing world a striking contrast to the global success its citizens have enjoyed in the worlds of sports and music.

 7527,  1964, a, HOUSTON Nov. 30 — The baseball franchise of Richmond in the International League was sold today to Toledo Ohio but the team will continue to operate as the leading minor‐league affiliate of the New York Yankees.The sale announced at the annual meetings of the major and minor leagues will bring Toledo back into the high minor leagues after an absence of 10 years. The club had played in the American Association as the Mudhens and then the Glass Sox until 1954.The team at Richmond had been owned by the Yankees untill two years ago when it was bought by Romeo Champagne a supermarket executive from Manchester N. H. Last season it played to only 148000 persons continuing a decline that had started about three years ago.Champagne sold the franchise to the Lucas County Recreation Commission in Ohio for a price that was reported to be between $90000 and $100000.
 6039,  1977, a, BANGKOK Thailand May 1 (AP)—The head of the Vietnamese delegation that is to open talks with the United States in Paris this week said that America must in Paris this week said that Washington must give up its “erroneous policy” toward Vietnam before relations can be established the Vietnam press agency reported today.In a broadcast monitored here the agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Pham Hien as saying in a statement issued in Paris that he would conduct the talks “with an attitude of good faith” but he declined to predict their outcome.Mr. Hien who arrived in Paris Friday said that Vietnam was looking to the future in its dealings with the United States. “But the past and the future cannot be separated” he said. “That's why one must settle satisfactorily the problems left by the past.”The Vietnamese have insisted the United States provide the economic aid promised in the Paris peace agreement of 1973 while the United States has demanded a full accounting of its troops missing in action during the Indochina war as a condition for diplomatic recognition.
 2988,  2002, a, The events of Sept. 11 scarred the skyline and jarred the language. From the first moments the disaster required new terms to describe new facts and feelings. In the last year a whole glossary has arisen to describe just about every aspect of the terrorist attacks. There's an ABC just for the international aspect (Al Qaeda American Taliban Axis of Evil . . .). A longer more touching vocabulary has arisen specifically from the destruction of the twin towers one reflecting strong human needs for utility and respect.The event. At first people spoke of the World Trade Center disaster or of the hijacked planes in New York Washington and Pennsylvania or of the terrorist attacks on America. All the terms were either cumbersome or by being selective risked ignoring bravery and suffering elsewhere. The language needed shorthand. Within a few weeks it had evolved: 9/11. The term variously pronounced ''nine-eleven'' or ''nine-one-one'' had been used in some places from the beginning. The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund for instance began on Sept. 12. The number of times the term appeared in The Times rose steadily reaching a peak in December. By then as if by informal national consensus 9/11 had become universal shorthand for the whole event.The people. The bland term ''first responders'' quickly morphed into ''heroes'' as the shocking loss of 343 firefighters and 23 New York City Police and 37 Port Authority officers sank in on the public. The world came to visualize firefighters climbing upstairs hefting heavy hoses or trudging downstairs carrying people in wheelchairs and the respect radiated so widely that people soon associated ''heroes'' with emergency workers everywhere.A different kind of respect showed in the words used to describe those unaccounted for in the World Trade Center. At first they were ''the missing'' a term that was then merely accurate. Who knew whether a loved one might turn up for instance in a New Jersey hospital across the Hudson. Later what had been accurate became considerate. To avoid the blunt finality of ''dead'' people referred to those ''lost'' on 9/11 out of respect for families still hoping against hope.
 2992,  2002, a, Hensher is a 37-year-old English novelist and reviewer who has a column in The Independent and has been a Booker Prize judge. He tells us in an afterword that the novelist A. .S Byatt urged him to write a long novel and he's made it in homage to the 19th century's literary greats. Couched in their accents riven with their preoccupations and perceptions ''The Mulberry Empire'' descends on London drawing rooms Crimean estates and oriental palaces in the very language of Victorian novelists.If there is something immediately odd about the atmosphere it's because Hensher imitates Thackeray writing about the division of rich and poor in Victorian London; he imitates Kipling writing about the gorgeous East; imitates -- who? Gissing I fancy -- writing about a literary cove called Stokes. In the Russian scenes I expected for a moment that he would try to scale the hare-coursing of ''War and Peace'' but it was only a nod and he elegantly sheered away toward the Crimean estates (their versts their town of S- their contented landlords). Hensher also imitates Conrad on the sea: ''Even when the winds started up again -- and it was as astonishing as imprevue an event as their disappearance -- we still felt becalmed marooned suspended in time.''Hensher's ventriloquism slides the novel into a sort of liminal space between reader and writer -- a space like Afghanistan itself devoured by Western eyes unwittingly besieged by Western dreams that lead to blunders retreats and surprise attacks coming down off the old brown hills with armies like narratives coursing through the defiles. Hensher is alive to the ironies of the historical novel. As they say the past is another country; it's also a country like Afghanistan as it once was: you can't go there. We know too little about the place but at the same time we know too much. We are burdened with hindsight.''He looked up into the utter clarity of the Afghan sky and saw something he had never seen before; a single cloud . . . a single brilliantly white line shining with the reflected sun being drawn as if with a piece of chalk. Burnes looked at it never having seen it before. Far above tens of thousands of feet above a jet plane was tearing across the sky. He looked: and to his mind came a single dictionary thought: disaster. . . . What it meant he did not know.''It happens once this eruption into the present day and it's enough to catch the reader offguard with his guilty knowledge. Hensher sets out to disturb our assumptions and keep us guessing. ''There is no power in the world even the cruellest and most arbitrary which does not believe itself to be merciful compassionate and wise'' says a delightfully enigmatic guide named Mohan Lal to his English employer Burgess. ''We are men of the world are we not? We both know that to seduce an intelligent woman we comment on her beauty; to lay siege to a beautiful woman it is best to compliment her on her intelligence. . . . Come now Burnes-ji; you believe what you are told because it is what you like to hear.''

 5431,  1987, a, ''I have difficulty you know reading a contract for a refrigerator'' is how Lewis A. Tambs former Ambassador to Costa Rica explained his failure to determine the legality of the Embassy's aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. He testified that ''the fact is that we in the Government have to rely upon legal counsel.'' He had assumed he said that ''the people [ in Washington ] who were giving the orders had sought and gotten the legal counsel'' that the aid was lawful.The main defense in prosecutions growing out of the Iran-contra investigations is likely to be ''The lawyers said it was legal.'' If a Government official did only what Government lawyers said he could do can courts convict him because the lawyers turn out to be wrong? The answer must be ''Sometimes.''Ignorance of the law is not supposed to be an excuse whether the ignorance is a product of blissful unawareness or counsel's bad advice. In the past the courts have refused to accept such an ''advice of counsel'' defense. But defendants in those cases usually have been private individuals who relied on the opinions of private lawyers. While the lawyers may have been guilty of malpractice the clients remained guilty of the crimes.We cannot be sure whether the ''advice of lawyers'' defense would work if the defendant were a Federal official who relied on Government counsel. Until recently the Justice Department had sole responsibility for prosecuting such officials. It would have been understandably reluctant to prosecute an official who was told by the Government's own lawyer - most often in the department itself - that what he planned to do was permissible.

 6268,  1973, a, Mayor Lindsay in appealing for approval of the transportation bond issue said:“The preservation of the 35‐cent fare on the city's subways and buses through state‐matching subsidies and the maintenance of present fares on the commuter railroads is a principle which I have long supported.“While the bond issue is not the only means through which this essential objective can be achieved it is clear that it is the only one which has the support of the Governor and majority leaders in the State Senate and Assembly.”The Mayor who has disagreed with Governor Rockefeller on many matters said it was “unfortunate” that no details had been made public on priorities in spending the bond money. But he added:“Despite these drawbacks I believe that on balance the transportation bond issue will be to the benefit of this city. Preservation of the fare at current levels and assuring state funds for additional subway construction outweigh the negative aspects of the proposition.”In his message to the City Planning Commission Mr. Lindsay as is traditional did not say precisely how much he wanted for each of the priority items.However Mr. Grossman pointed out that since in previous years Mayor Lindsay's administration had spent a great deal on construction of police stations and firehouses much of the apital money for the coming year was intended for anticrime technology such as the new voice‐alarm boxes and funds for block‐security programs.The Budget Director also said that if the proposed exclusion of sewer construction and anti ‐ pollution facilities from the debt limit was voted down the city would be forced to cut its construction of such projects.The Planning Commission after three days of hearings early in December is to submit its draft for the capital budget to the Mayor on Jan. 2. By Feb. 1 the new Mayor is to give his executive capital budget to the City Council for its consideration.

The amplified plinking of a ukelele helped attract a polite but undemonstrative crowd to the Time‐Life Building plaza at 50th Street and the Avenue of the Americas to hear him challenge his Republican opponent's law‐and‐order rhetoric.The presence of Mr. Beame attracted a crowd of dutiful Democratic officials — regular reform and unclassifiable — to sit on a flat‐bed trailer bedecked in plastic red white and blue bunting along with the man most politicians believe will be New York City's next Mayor.Former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy introduced Mr. Beame as “the next Mayor” and Mr. Beame reciting a familiar litany of official actions he has taken to help law enforcement said: “This is how you fight crime. You don't fight it by taking out newspaper ads or by hysteria.”Frank G. Rossetti the Manhattan Democratic leader was chief of protocol allocating seats on the trailer and was host later for hot dogs soda and beer at the opening of Manhattan headquarters for the Democratic team—Mr. Beame Paul O'Dwyer for City Council President and State Senator Harrison J. Goldin for Controller—at 16 West 57th Street.Mr. Beame wore a big “Go Mets” lapel button and an air of cheerful confidence as he accepted the deferential attention of people who clearly consider him a winner and thus a man who will have some say about their political well‐being.As far as Manhattan is concerned Mr. Rossetti said the black and Puerto Rican votes will be crucial and “I think we're going to do all right.”Mr. Beame said he thought so too. “Maybe it's just me” he said with a shrug to indicate his awareness that a candidate can be fooled by what goes on in his immediate neighborhood “but the reception's been so warm—I think it's going to be all right.”
 4379,  1994, a, "I think I have the game to beat anyone" said Williams who nonetheless made it clear she wasn't ready to predict an outcome for her second professional outing.Despite keeping her distance from the controversy percolating around her decision to join the WTA Tour at 14 Williams has long understood that her debut would be regarded as a moment of truth not a mere introduction.That's why she requested that it take place in California her home state: She could conjure up comforting memories of going undefeated here against her peers back when she was 10.And surrounded by an entourage that included her parents her sister her coach a hitting partner and the family's lawyer and accountant -- who maintained they were on hand for moral support rather than contractual assistance for the new pro -- Williams cruised through her debut with a refreshing mix of serenity and ambition.While her father Richard coped with the camera crews and the news media interrogations Williams simply went onto the court and as the Rolling Stones played next door to a crowd of 45000 proved her mettle to this first-round gathering of 900.Stafford was not critical of the hysteria accompanying Williams' debut which so far has eclipsed not only the last-ever appearance here by 38-year-old Martina Navratilova but also overshadowed the professional debut of 16-year-old Meilen Tu the 1994 U.S. Open junior champion and the return to the circuit of Sanchez Vicario the reigning French and U.S. Open champion."She's going to be great for women's tennis" said Stafford.Macci who has coached Williams since she was 11 said this positive beginning came as a relief."After all she hadn't competed in three years and when you've got a 14-year-old with the type of game Venus has it's a little dicey: she doesn't just stand at the baseline and bang away at the ball" said Macci who also coached Jennifer Capriati prior to her turning pro at 13. "Venus's game is probably five times more complicated than Jennifer's was at this age and that means there's going to be more mistakes."

 3669,  1998, a, Voicing concern about the face that Rockefeller Center will project to Fifth Avenue and the world the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission recommended yesterday that the center's owners scale back plans to turn some stone exteriors into virtual walls of glass.The commission's 11 members took no formal action during a public meeting on the topic. But they did say cordially but firmly that the architects hired by Rockefeller Center's owner needed to produce ideas that were more in line with the landmark's architectural and historical traditions.''It's par for the course to have revisions in large and important applications'' said Jennifer J. Raab the commission's chairwoman. ''But there was a level of concern over some of the elements that would be out of character of Rockefeller Center's architecture.''In particular the commission said that it was uncomfortable with a proposal by the architects Beyer Blinder Belle to replace the muted second-story office windows with retail display windows. It was also uncomfortable though less adamantly with a plan to expand one-story showcases along Fifth Avenue with much more glass and bigger signs.

 4837,  1991, a, Q. Our finished basement which is used as a guest computer and sewing room shows no signs of leaks; however it gets very humid in the summer so much so that mold grows on the furniture records and books. This area adjoins an unfinished part of the basement that contains the laundry. We have thought of running a dehumidifier all the time to control the mold but I think this would be quite expensive. Is there anything else we can do to solve the humidity problem?A. If the walls are finished or covered with paneling of some type there may be seepage through the foundation walls that you cannot see. Also check the outside to make sure that all surface water drains away from the foundation especially water pouring out of the downspouts during a heavy rain. Finally if the laundry area has a clothes dryer make sure it is vented directly to the outside. Otherwise this could be the source of the humidity.Q. I own a condominium in a high-rise building. Whenever I take a shower the walls and ceiling of the bathroom are covered with moisture. I tried sizing the walls and running a fan but this has not helped. Someone suggested I install a ceiling exhaust fan. Would this help?A. You need some type of fan that exhausts directly to the outside either through the ceiling or the wall unless your building already has an exhaust system for the bathrooms. Even with an exhaust fan or built-in exahust vents condensation on walls and ceilings is almost inevitable when taking a hot shower with the bathroom door closed.

 5888,  1983, a, TRENTON THE first year of the Kean administration a period marked by economic problems and partisan bickering has ended. Prospects for continued turmoil in the State House during the coming legislative election year also appear great for every major bill will be debated with an eye toward its effect on the re-election chances of the 120 members of the Senate and Assembly.Last year began with calls for bi-partisan cooperation by Governor Kean who won election by the smallest margin in state history and by the Democratic leaders in the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Kean a Republican was the first incoming Governor in recent history to win election without also pulling in majorities of his own party in both houses of the Legislature.This proved costly as problems caused by the ailing national economy escalated routine partisan posturing into confrontation. Before the year ended Mr. Kean had repeatedly called the legislative leadership ''irresponsible'' for failing to enact new taxes to support state budget needs. At the same time both the Senate President Carmen A. Orechio Democrat of Nutley and the Assembly Speaker Alan J. Karcher Democrat of Sayreville pictured the Governor as ''timid'' and lacking the leadership to find a solution to the budget crisis.Relations between the two branches of government were strained during the first six months by the necessity of trimming more than $200 million from spending requests before enacting the current fiscal-year budget of $6.2 billion a record high.

 683,  2015, a, J. Edgar Hoover the director of the F.B.I. designated the Black Panthers a nationalist hate group and would soon declare them “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.” Most of the activity of his bureau’s notorious counterintelligence program (known as Cointelpro) was devoted to trying to disrupt divide and destroy the Panthers. Hoover was particularly concerned with preventing a black “messiah” from rising within the party’s ranks and uniting blacks with white radicals on college campuses and in the antiwar movement into a potentially revolutionary force.One of the curious things about Hoover as a historical figure is the symmetry between his paranoia and some of the grander aspirations of his adversaries. Mr. Nelson’s film is subtitled “Vanguard of the Revolution” which is certainly how the Panthers came to envision themselves. But the revolution that unfolded in their wake was the one that took Reagan to the White House and that has frequently taken pains to disguise its origins in racial backlash politics.The Panthers’ own record as Mr. Nelson shows was a more complicated affair and his film captures the drama of their rise and fall without sacrificing the nuances the shifting play of strategy and tactics means and ends personalities and procedures. He talks to a handful of historians journalists and law enforcement officers but the bulk of the testimony — rousing rueful funny and frank — comes from within the Black Panther rank and file.A few of those members are fairly well known like Kathleen Cleaver who was married to Eldridge Cleaver from 1967 to 1987 and Elaine Brown head of the party from 1974-1977. (Ms. Brown author of a memoir of her time in the party called “A Taste of Power” has accused Mr. Nelson of turning “the history of the Black Panther Party into a two-dimensional palliative for white people and Negroes who are comfortable in America’s oppressive status quo.”) Mr. Newton whose 1968 manslaughter conviction made “Free Huey” a rallying cry for the New Left died in 1989 in a gunfight on an Oakland street. Mr. Cleaver who left the United States in 1968 to escape arrest on attempted murder charges after a shootout with the Oakland police and who became a conservative Republican after returning from his exile died in 1998. Mr. Seale is not interviewed in the film. But the absence of firsthand testimony from these three leaders doesn’t limit the film’s scope. Instead it allows us to see them through the eyes of their followers and to see from a distance how they reflected the passions of their moment.

 1799,  2008, a, NEW ORLEANS — After a day of watching bowl games it’s nice to get settled in the press box here at the Superdome. Players are milling around on the field during pregame warm ups. The Georgia fans just roared in approval as some of their players ran onto the field.Georgia Coach Mark Richt called for the fans to wear all black the same color of the uniforms Georgia will be wearing and it appears that most have responded. The Hawaii fans are dressed in white and are settled into their seats. The assembled media members are anxious to see the Ha’a the version of the haka dance that the Warriors do prior to every game. They were flagged for it in Ruston La. earlier in the year when they performed it before a game against Louisiana Tech.The big question in the press box before the game is if the Warriors can hang around. W.A.C. Commissioner Karl Benson said that he hoped it would be a game in the fourth quarter. The Warriors have been a great story. Do you think that they can hang around tonight?

 5619,  1986, a, ''Instead of using their individual assets to secure the loan they chose to burden the Placid Oil Company and the Hunt trusts with the obligation to pay their personal debts'' the bank said. The bank concluded that the Hunts ''have rendered themselves personally liable'' to repay the loans to Placid and Penrod.The Bank of America sued the Hunt brothers their trustees and Penrod to recover overdue loans totaling more than $76 million. The largest lawsuit against the Hunts filed by one of its lenders was by the First National Bank of Chicago. Listing by First ChicagoFirst Chicago said it was seeking to recover $100 million in loans to Penrod $90 million in loans to two companies placed into bankruptcy by the Hunts in 1982 the Hunt International Resources Corporation and a subsidiary Great Western Sugar and $25 million it lost by participating in foreign exchange transactions with the Hunts. First Chicago said it wanted $220 million in additional damages.The 10 major lenders to Placid Oil each of which holds loans of $53.9 million include Bankers Trust Bank of Montreal Citibank First City National Bank of Houston Republicbank-Dallas First Interstate Bank of California Manufacturers Hanover Trust Mellon Bank Security Pacific National Bank and Texas Commerce Bank. Eight other banks have loans to Placid ranging from $27.6 million to $40.7 million.A bankruptcy lawyer not involved in the case Martin I. Klein said other creditors soon might act to seize collateral offered by the Hunts in other business transactions. That in turn is likely to provoke the Hunts to place other assets under the shield of bankruptcy courts he added. ''The bankruptcy of Placid Oil may trigger other bankruptcies with other creditors'' Mr. Klein said. He added that the banks also could ask the bankruptcy court for permission to move ahead with the foreclosures blocked in the Chapter 11 filings although approval typically is uncertain. 'Extraordinarily Difficult'Mr. McCabe the Hunt lawyer said he saw no prospect for a continuing string of foreclosures by his clients. As for the banks' intention to pursue Hunt assets not formally pledged as collateral for loans to Placid and Penrod ''it would be extraordinarily difficult'' to achieve Mr. McCabe said.The Bank of America and other Hunt lenders in arguing that the Hunts used Placid and Penrod as vehicles to rescue them from losses in silver trading are employing the legal principle known as ''alter ego.'' Mr. Klein said it was ''a long-shot approach'' and difficult to prove.

 2452,  2005, a, IT is something of a Fashion Week tradition to gauge which newcomer will generate the most buzz which up-and-coming designer will whet the appetite of retailers with the presentation of mere sketches. For the New York shows which begin Sept. 8 a leading contender is Brian Reyes a designer who held jobs for Ralph Lauren Michael Kors and Oscar de la Renta before branching out on his own at the age of 24.The pattern of previous designers who became prominent in American fashion within a matter of seasons -- people like Zac Posen Derek Lam and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler -- was certainly on Mr. Reyes's mind when he decided to create his own collection for spring 2006. But Mr. Reyes has a history of precocious behavior.As a teenager in Fort Lauderdale Fla. he befriended several stylists and assisted them on fashion shoots in Miami. By 19 he had saved enough money working at a Coach store to move to New York having persuaded the company to let him work at its Madison Avenue location. After less than a month in the city he got his first design job at Polo Ralph Lauren where he made clothes for boys."They only found out later I was 19" said Mr. Reyes who went on to become the men's collection designer for Mr. Kors in 2001 and joined Mr. de la Renta's design studio in 2004.

 3761,  1997, a, This year's market has been adept at defying skeptics. After shrugging off summer doldrums stocks have made substantial gains over the last three months. The Dow has returned 9.6 percent since Sept. 30 with stocks like Philip Morris American Express and I.B.M. posting returns above 20 percent. Even the jitters caused earlier last month by remarks by Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve chairman seem to have been forgotten as investors who continue to put money into the market after declines are rewarded. ''It has reinforced investor confidence'' Mr. Kaufman said.Not everybody had as much reason to celebrate of course. Large-company stocks were the clear favorites during the year as investors sought the security and safety of well-known names in large multinational companies like Coca-Cola as protection against the whims of the economy. Small stocks as measured by the Russell 2000 index fared less well after this summer's downturn. The Russell ended 1996 up 14.76 percent to close at 362.61 -- near where it was trading in May.The year's exuberance has made some pause and wonder. ''Investors have to be very happy'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''They're surprised shocked and a little concerned because they didn't expect this and don't know what to make of it.''And as they did at the end of 1995 some experts are warning investors not to expect more of the same. The last decade has blessed stocks with all the right ingredients: the slashing of interest rates and inflation tax-cutting and the fattening of corporate profit margins Mr. Micheletti noted adding ''A lot of forces behind the bull market are mature long in tooth and unlikely to repeat.''Still investors may not want to make the kind of contrarian bets that have paid off in the past. While some are betting on a resurgence in smaller stocks which showed some signs of occurring early in December these stocks may not be outperformers in 1997.''The economy is brutal in terms of competitiveness'' said Thomas McManus a strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company who cautions investors not to discount the strength of large companies which have proved more profitable than some of their smaller counterparts.The market's future remains murky even as yesterday's decline was a reminder of just how anxious investors are. While some forecasters say the economy could heat up enough to warrant interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve others are convinced that the economy is slowing down. ''People have been swinging back and forth on the economy'' Mr. Kaufman said.

 2448,  2005, a, The pianist Marc-André Hamelin has made his name by programming intensely difficult works and then dispatching them not only with an ironclad technique but with thoughtfulness and musicality as well. That combination of qualities is clearly in demand: when he performed at the International Keyboard Institute and Festival at the Mannes College of Music on Saturday evening the school's concert hall was packed.Mr. Hamelin's program was a concise tour of Romantic pianism from its Classical roots in the early decades of the 19th century through the unabashed exhibitionism that extended into the 20th century. This is music of composers who were also pianists and who wrote to their own strengths. The 20th century saw the end of that -- and a preference among composers for the hyper-rational rather than the overtly showy. But Romantic pianism never quite died away and judging from the performances at Mannes these last couple of weeks in fact it has returned with a vengeance.Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 664) in Mr. Hamelin's reading had a graceful Classical veneer with the rumblings of Romantic rebelliousness peeking through its textures. In its first movement especially it was as though the melodies in the right hand were etched by Mozart while the left hand accompaniments were by Beethoven. Mr. Hamelin in keeping his dynamics and phrasing flexible made that tension especially poignant.The Schubert Sonata shared the first half of the program with nine of Leopold Godowsky's "Studies After Chopin's Études." In these astonishing reworkings Godowsky took the already difficult Chopin études as a starting point and painted on fresh decorative layers. In some cases that meant padding out chords to create a bigger richer sound. Elsewhere it was a matter of reharmonizing the originals setting Chopin's familiar themes amid strange hues and textures.
 3867,  1997, a, The French police opened a criminal investigation today to determine whether a chase by seven photographers on motorcycles was responsible for the car crash here that killed Diana Princess of Wales and her companion the Harrods heir Emad Mohammed al-Fayed shortly after midnight. This evening Prince Charles the heir to the British throne and Diana's husband until their marriage ended in divorce a year ago flew here from Scotland and sadly accepted her body in a plain wooden coffin from President Jacques Chirac at Pitie-Salpetriere university hospital near the Sorbonne.With Diana's two sisters Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale Charles then flew back to a shocked and grieving Britain with the body.The police did not identify the photographers except by their nationalities six French and one Macedonian all said to be commercial freelance photographers working on commission for photographic agencies. After questioning them all night the authorities placed all seven in formal detention which allows them to be held for 48 hours without charges. The police were said to have seized several rolls of their film.''The inquiry will establish in more detail the role that these people may have played in the cause of the accident and how they behaved at the site'' a statement by the Paris prosecutor's office said.
 3684,  1998, a, Mr. Fleischer and others credit the Brazilian President with acting quickly to contain the effects of the Asian crisis. [Wednesday's auction of Telebras which brought the Government $19 billion for its controlling stake in the national telecommunications system showed that investors remain bullish on the country's medium- and long-term prospects.]Indeed Brazil receives the most direct foreign investment of any emerging market.This all has created a certain euphoria about Brazil's prospects but analysts stress that the nation's economic health has suffered with the President's failure to follow through. In part because of the sharp increase in interest rates the budget deficit climbed to 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product with the deficit for April nearly 80 percent higher than that for April 1997.''A lot of the measures were 'for the English to see' '' said Alexandre Barros an economic consultant using an expression dating back to the 1800's when Brazil deeply in debt to England distracted its creditors by pledging to turn over customs revenue which had been falsely inflated.Despite the pledges to outsiders Mr. Barros said the Government has increased rather than cut spending since November. ''The Government did a lot but the lot that it did was not enough especially with the deficit'' he said.In a recent interview in Brasilia Finance Minister Pedro Malan acknowledged that the austerity measures President Cardoso promoted last fall were ''absolutely essential'' to shoring up Brazil's standing at the time. Though they were not all carried out he said ''we showed that we were firmly committed to continuing to move forward with the real.''With the country's foreign-exchange reserves at nearly $71 billion after falling to $52 billion when the Government was forced to defend the currency last fall Mr. Malan argued that Brazil was now ''in a better position'' and he called a devaluation ''out of the question.'' The real which trades within an exchange-rate band is selling at 1.163 to the dollar down from 1.10 last November.The economic and financial restructuring effort known here as the Real Plan began four years ago. It proceeded from his time as Finance Minister in the previous administration reducing inflation to less than 5 percent this year from quadruple digits at its worst stage. And it has helped lift millions of Brazilians out of poverty in part by broadening access to credit. Before the effects of the Asian crisis spread the sales of cars appliances and other consumer goods had mushroomed in this country.

 1955,  2008, a, The Football Scientist KC Joyner contributes weekly to The Fifth Down. His latest book is “Blindsided: Why the Left Tackle is Overrated and Other Contrarian Football Thoughts.”I often say that I review players with both a metric eye (meaning via statistical analysis) and a scouting eye (meaning via traditional tape analysis). At no position is this statement truer than at quarterback. With that thought in mind here is my take on the question of which quarterback I would pick to guide my team for the next 10 years: Eli Manning or Tony Romo.I’ll start with the metric overview. There are three main metrics I use for gauging quarterback play: yards per attempt (YPA) success percentage and bad decision percentage. I use these in place of the official passer rating system because that method tends to reward dink and dunk quarterbacks and punish gunslingers. In this series of measurements each type of quarterback will have his individual strengths and weaknesses displayed and as such I think it makes for a more detailed granular form of analysis.Yards Per AttemptI use four route depth levels when tracking YPA. They are: short (1-10 yards) medium (11-19 yards) deep (20-29 yards) and bomb (30+ yards). Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 totals through week 8:ManningRoute Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 139 100 823 4 1 3 18 5.9 Medium 48 24 411 2 1 4 20 8.3 Deep 19 8 217 1 1 1 5 11.1 Bomb 13 3 106 2 1 1 31 9.8 Other 10 1 31 0 0 0 0 3.1 Total 229 136 1588 9 4 9 74 7.0RomoRoute Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 132 98 923 6 1 2 9 7.0 Medium 35 19 374 4 3 0 0 10.7 Deep 14 4 108 1 1 1 -10 6.5 Bomb 10 5 264 3 0 0 0 26.4 Other 11 0 0 0 0 1 5 0.4 Total 202 126 1669 14 5 4 4 8.1Romo has been better this year on short passes by just over a yard and he was better in 2007 by a similar amount. Romo also has a lead in two of the three vertical routes (i.e. medium deep and bomb) and his combined YPA on vertical passes is also much higher (10.3 to 8.6).This doesn’t look like a one-year anomaly either as Romo’s 2007 vertical YPA was appreciably better than Manning’s (12.2 to 8.8) although to be fair some of the metric difference in 2007 probably had to do with Plaxico Burress’ injury. Even with that caveat I still have to give the overall YPA edge to Romo.Success PercentageSuccess percentage is determined by adding the number of completions and defensive passing penalties (i.e. any penalties that happen while the pass is in the air such as pass interference illegal contact etc.) and dividing that total by the total number of attempts. The total number of attempts includes both the defensive and offensive pass penalties (e.g. offensive pass interference). Other passes are balls that either don’t make it past the line of scrimmage (e.g. pass knocked down at line) or are throwaway tosses.Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 success percentage totals by route depth:ManningRoute Depth Success % Short 74.1% Medium 56.3% Deep 47.4% Bomb 30.8% Other 10.0% Total 62.9%RomoRoute Depth Success % Short 75.8% Medium 54.3% Deep 35.7% Bomb 50.0% Other 9.1% Total 64.4%This is a very even contest. Manning is a bit better in medium passes and much better in deep ones but Romo has a big edge in bomb throws and a slight edge in short ones. The overall split between these two in 2008 is negligible but in 2007 and 2006 Romo’s percentages were quite superior over Manning’s (64.5% to 57.1% in 2007 65.6% to 58.7% in 2006). Again a metric segment goes in favor of Romo.Bad Decision PercentageThis metric gauges how often a quarterback makes a mistake with a pass that either leads to an interception or a near interception. These gaffes can range from staring at a receiver to not seeing a defender in a passing lane but the common thread is that they are errors that generate turnover opportunities for the opponent.The key to keep in mind in this metric is that small percentages make a huge difference. For example a 2.0% bad decision rate means that a passer is messing up once in every fifty passes. A 3.0% rate in this category doesn’t look that much higher but it means a quarterback’s error rate is now up to once in every thirty-three passes. To express this in game terms the 2.0% rate means the mistakes are coming about two times in every three games (or less if the team doesn’t throw often) while the 3.0% means they are probably coming once in every single contest.So how do Romo and Manning fare in this category? Thus far in 2008 they are about equal. Manning has a 2.5 % rate and Romo a 2.9% rate. That wasn’t the case in 2007 however as Romo’s 4.0% bad decision clip ranked him 5th worst among qualifying quarterbacks. Manning wasn’t that much better but his 3.4% rate was lower. Their 2006 totals were about equal (1.9% for Romo 1.8% for Manning) so that means that Manning gets the overall edge in this category albeit by moderate margin.IntangiblesThis is where the scouting eye comes in. I look for a lot of things when scouting QBs but it really boils down to one question – does he make his team play better than their talent level says they should?Take Philip Rivers. It is said that he possesses great intangibles and that those were a main reason his NC State teams went 34-17. The track record says something a bit different. To quote from Scientific Football 2006 “Winning two out of every three games is a praiseworthy feat…but in this case there should be a big asterisk next to it. Fourteen of [Rivers’] thirty-four wins came against teams that either ended the season with three wins or less or were non-Division 1A opponents. Two more victories came against teams that ended the season with four wins. Add them up and it means that nearly one-half of Rivers’ collegiate wins came against poor competition. Or to put it another way Rivers was 18-17 against good teams.”I point this out because Rivers and Manning came into the league at the same time and Rivers is always touted for his leadership while Manning has often been knocked for his lack of fire. I used to be one of the pundits who knocked Manning but I stopped doing this once I saw that his teams were doing better and going further than Rivers’ more talented Chargers teams.For instance Rivers led a team with a 12-14 win talent level to a 14-2 mark in 2006 but then piloted them to a home divisional playoff game loss. The 2007 Chargers were nearly as loaded as their predecessors and he guided them to a wild-card berth. He won the opening playoff game that season against a limited Tennessee roster and technically got the win in the divisional round but he wasn’t on the field when San Diego’s offense made their comeback. The Bolts were quite banged up for the AFC championship and couldn’t overcome the Patriots. Put it all together and it means that Rivers has but the single wild-card playoff win that he can claim as his own. That’s a poor record when you have a physically superior team as the Chargers were in those seasons.Contrast that to Manning. The Giants have always had a very good roster but my personnel eye says they were not in San Diego’s league. New York also played in a division that was strong from top to bottom unlike the AFC West. In spite of this Manning has led his team to more playoff berths and more playoff wins than Rivers has. I don’t like to lean solely on the win criterion as it has its weaknesses (see Trent Dilfer and the 2000 Ravens) but in this case Manning has done a lot more with a less than Rivers has so I’ve taken to giving him the edge in that matchup.Now let’s look at Romo. The Cowboys have been the near equals (if not equals) to the Chargers in roster strength the past couple of seasons and yet Romo has not a single playoff win to show for it. He also lost a home divisional game to a Manning-led Giants squad last year. I can’t put all of that on Romo but lack of leadership is one of the reasons that team is losing the big games and some of that does fall at the feet of the quarterback. That means Manning gets a large edge in this department and it’s the reason I have to go with Manning as the better QB.
 3009,  2002, a, He soon noticed that his teammates did not share those concerns. We'll catch them by the All-Star Game they said build up the lead in the second half and clinch with a week or more left in the season.It happened.''It's like clockwork -- they know'' Giambi said. ''That's the thing that makes them so good: they never panic. They know their game plan and what they're shooting for. I mean it's amazing when you hear about it to be a part of it. The Yankee mystique.''Curt Schilling might not buy that but Giambi does or at least he sells it well. He speaks reverently of the team and the city the energy and the excitement. Words like incredible and unbelievable flow freely when he talks.Giambi said he was not concerned that he would put too much pressure on himself the way he did at the start of the regular season. Through his first 15 games Giambi hit .255 with two homers and six runs batted in. He finished at .314 with 41 homers and 122 R.B.I.''I was walking out the first month trying to hit 40 home runs in one game'' said Giambi who batted .388 with nine homers in September. ''I'm no longer at that period. Now it's take good at-bats take a walk or drive in a big run the same things I basically did in Oakland but being comfortable with my surroundings with my routine.''Early in the season Giambi was not so much in awe of Yankee Stadium as he was frustrated by it. He had four hits in Game 5 of the division series at Yankee Stadium last fall his last game with the A's but entered this season batting just .245 in the Bronx with one homer.''This ballpark'' Manager Joe Torre said ''isn't quite as friendly as Oakland was for him because of his ability to hit the ball to left-center. That spot's 399 here and it's a little bit shorter in Oakland. The tendency when you're in a lull is to try to pull it to right field.''

 4426,  1993, a, The Talking Band has a long history of treating topical subjects in imaginatively oblique ways. And "The Blue Sky Is a Curse" a trilogy of surreal music-theater pieces whose title was inspired by a Magritte painting is typical of the whimsical approach taken by the venerable experimental ensemble.Its three related vignettes all set in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots evoke personal alienation against a canvas of violent social upheaval. In Paul Zimet's three-character play "Baron Bones" an agoraphobic poet (Tom Nelis) and his Eastern European girlfriend (Terry McCarthy) exchange opposite views of Los Angeles. When she leaves he is visited by a potion-peddling black shaman (William Badgett) who takes him on a mental journey into the heart of the riots."Brown Dog Is Dead" which was written and composed by Ellen Maddow portrays elderly immigrants Nino and Pearl (Mr. Zimet and Tina Shepard) who bicker reminisce and fret about what to do because a Social Security computer has registered Pearl as deceased. As Nino drifts into surrealistic reveries and mysterious leaks appear in the house the play produces a dizzying sense of a tiny world crumbling to bits inside of a larger one that is going up in flames.The two vignettes are linked by the musicalized sounds of the plumbers working in the building where the characters live. And the final piece Ms. Maddow's one-act opera "The Plumber's Helper" focuses on the plumbers (Mr. Badgett Ms. Maddow Ms. McCarthy) who bemoan their frustrating love lives. Their confessions suggest a modern-day variation on Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" in the language of contemporary sexual politics.

They then participate in a fishbowl discussion about journalism codes of ethics and write response papers.Author(s):Michelle Sale The New York Times Learning NetworkYasmin Chin Eisenhauer The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Examine how the First Amendment applies to the media.2. Consider questions of journalism ethics after a magazine agreed to turn confidential sources over to a grand jury by reading and discussing the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison.”3. Read codes of ethics for various media organizations then participate in a fishbowl discussion on press rights and responsibilities.4. Write response papers about Time magazine’s decision to provide documents revealing confidential sources to a grand jury.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Time Inc.

WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “The First Amendment of the United States Constitution states that ‘Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.’ What does this mean? What is the significance of a free press in a democratic society?” After a few minutes allow students time to share their answers. As a class brainstorm a list of situations actions or events where freedom of the press may be attacked or restricted due to other compelling interests. (The annotated text of the First Amendment is available from the FindLaw Web site at //caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/.)Explain to students that they will now read an article about a current legal case in which two reporters one for Time magazine and the other for The New York Times are being legally compelled to turn over their notes regarding a confidential source. (Background information about the case involving Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller known as the Valerie Plame investigation can be found online at the Web site for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press at //www.rcfp.org/shields_and_subpoenas.html#plame.)2. As a class read and discuss the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050701friday.html) focusing on the following questions:a.

Provide each group with copies of codes of ethics from various media organizations such as the American Society of Newspaper Editors the National Press Photographers Association and the Radio-Television News Directors Association. Codes of ethics for these and other organizations can be found at //www.asne.org/ideas/codes/codes.htm. Explain that they will be briefly examining these codes of ethics to prepare for a fishbowl discussion on journalism ethics.After a few minutes ask students to share what elements stood out from these codes. Write key words and ideas on the board for reference.Then explain to the class that they will be participating in a “fishbowl” discussion on journalism ethics. First ask students to number off one to five and then keep a list on the board of all “1’s” “2’s” “3’s” “4’s” and “5’s.” Ask all “1’s” to sit facing one another in the middle of a circle created by the rest of the students. The students in the center are the only ones allowed to speak. If a student from the outer circle wants to add to the discussion he or she moves to the middle of the circle taps a participant to indicate that he or she should resume a place in the outer circle and takes that student’s place as the new person in the discussion. After discussing the first question switch the students in the center to all “2’s” and allow the same fishbowl procedure to occur. Be sure to switch topics enough times so that all students have the opportunity to be in the center of the discussion at least once.Questions to pose to students include:-What is the role of the media in a democratic society?-Jail is often viewed as a deterrent of crimes or a corrective measure to prevent repeated crimes. Is jail an appropriate punishment for a journalist who refuses to reveal sources? Why or why not?-What are the dangers of limiting the freedoms journalists are entitled to when gathering information?-Do individual reporters and media companies have similar or different responsibilities to readers? To the law? To company shareholders? To the ethics of their profession?-Which is more important the public’s right to know or the judicial system’s need for information? Why?4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually students write reaction papers responding to the following task copied into a handout for easier student access: “Read the following statements taken from the article read during class. Write a 1-2 page paper responding to one or more of the following quotations. In addition to commenting on this opinion provide your own feelings about Time magazine’s decision to provide documents revealing confidential sources to a grand jury. Do you agree with this decision? Why or why not? Based on your reading and discussion in class how might this decision affect the actions of journalists and media organizations in the short term and in the future? How might it affect you as a news consumer?”QUOTATIONS-Norman Pearlstine editor in chief of Time Inc.: “‘I found myself really coming to the conclusion’ he said ‘that once the Supreme Court has spoken in a case involving national security and a grand jury we are not above the law and we have to behave the way ordinary citizens do.'”-Arthur Sulzberger Jr. publisher of The New York Times: “‘We are deeply disappointed by Time Inc.’s decision to deliver the subpoenaed records’ he said. ‘We faced similar pressures in 1978 when both our reporter Myron Farber and The Times Company were held in contempt of court for refusing to provide the names of confidential sources. Mr. Farber served 40 days in jail and we were forced to pay significant fines.'”-Zachary W. Carter a former United States attorney in Brooklyn: “‘I don’t believe that a company has the right to put the assets of it shareholders at risk in an act of civil disobedience’ he said. ‘On the other hand the reporters are only faced with the consequences to them personally. They have the absolute right to put their liberty and fortunes at risk.'”-James C. Goodale a former general counsel of The Times Company and an authority on legal protections for reporters: “‘A public company must protect its assets even if that means going into contempt’ he said. ‘It has an obligation under the First Amendment to protect those assets and it’s in the interest of shareholders to protect those assets.'”Students may share their response papers in a future class.Further Questions for Discussion:-Why might a reporter use an anonymous source?-What other professions have ethical codes?-How is an ethical code different from judicial laws?-What characterizes fair and honest reporting?-In the case of anonymous sources is a journalist or media organization that refuses to reveal sources acting “above the law”?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on completion of initial journal responses participation in class and group discussions thoughtful participation in fishbowl discussion and well-explained response papers.Vocabulary:confidential disclosure covert gravest subpoena precedent scrutiny credibility bias testify substantial counsel contempt of court incarceration curare acquitted relinquished obligations divvied civil disobedience consequences liberty fortunes beneficial institutional assets fate syndicated operative payback nepotistic boondoggle presumably scandals chillingExtension Activities:1. Research and write a briefing paper outlining the Watergate scandal and the role journalism ethics played in the reporting about it. What stance did Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward take regarding their sources? What stance did their editor Ben Bradlee and their employer The Washington Post take? How did the Supreme Court respond?2. Write a reaction paper examining why journalists unlike other professionals require a code of ethics that allows for the use of anonymous sources. Is there any other industry or field that legally uses anonymous sources?3. Create a pamphlet explaining how to begin a career in journalism. What type of schooling or training is necessary? Where can a person gain experience? What options are there within the field of journalism? Who are some famous journalists in each field? Why are they notable?4. Read “Red Light Green Light: A Plea for Balance in Media Ethics” by Roy Peter Clark (//www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=82553&sid=32) paying close attention to his “Red Light” and “Green Light” ethics lists. Write a position paper either supporting or opposing Mr. Clark’s opinion about how current affairs have impacted journalism ethics. Besides agreeing or disagreeing discuss the dangers of limiting (or not limiting) the media and work tactics of journalists.5. The Supreme Court case Branzburg v. Hayes (1972) examines whether news reporters being required to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries constitutes an abridgement of the freedoms of speech and press as guaranteed by the First Amendment.6. Conduct a debate on whether or not it is the responsibility of a news organization to protect its reporters in situations such as the one involving Mr. Cooper and Ms. Miller. Consider the stance of Time Inc. as well as The New York Times.Interdisciplinary Connections:Fine Arts – Create a poster illustrating the value of anonymous sources to American journalists.Global History-Research journalism ethics in various countries. Keep in mind that the type of government a nation has affects the way the media is run. Consider the media in non-democratic countries such as Cuba China Vietnam North Korea Iran the former Soviet Union etc. Prepare a chart illustrating the names of the countries types of government number of legal media outlets laws applicable to the media etc.-Prepare an oral presentation examining civil disobedience. What forms does it take? What famous acts of civil disobedience have occurred throughout world history? What impact did each event have?Teaching with The Times-Continue to read articles relating to the case against Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller. Clip headlines and key paragraphs and compile them into a news ethics journal. For each clipping write a brief summary of the article and you reaction to the events in this story.-Read and clip “The Ethicist” column by Randy Cohen in the Sunday New York Times Magazine for a month and respond to Mr. Cohen about one or more of his decisions.

 438,  2016, a, A Brace of DarcysPRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1995)Any discussion of Austen adaptations must begin with the BBC’s 1995 “Pride & Prejudice.” That stalking smolderer! That damp shirt! This mini-series starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy gave birth to the modern Jane Austen industry. And yet as hot as the production is the screenplay by Andrew Davies is astonishingly faithful to the text. Huge swaths of it are word for witty word. Read a review of “Pride and Prejudice.”Rating:PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1940)Dystopia and psychedelic drugs you think when you think of Aldous Huxley. But he is credited with writing this wickedly wisecracking confection that stars Laurence Olivier (he of the pride) and Greer Garson (she of the prejudice). The outright funniest of all Austen films. Good for a “spot the anachronism” viewing party too: “That’s the most heartening piece of news since the Battle of Waterloo!” a delighted Mrs. Bennet exclaims when she hears that a single man of large fortune has moved into the neighborhood. The battle was yet to be waged. Read a review of “Pride and Prejudice.”Rating:BRIDGET JONES’S DIARY (2001)Helen Fielding’s affectionate sendup of the Colin Firth phenomenon doubles as a contemporary retelling of “P&P.” Renée Zellweger is an un-Lizzy-like Bridget but Mr. Firth gamely revives his Darcy. Andrew Davies shares screenwriting credit again. Read a review of “Bridget Jones’s Diary.”Rating:PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1980)David Rintoul is the iciest of Darcys in the BBC’s pre-Firth effort. Feel the brrrrr.Rating:DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY (2013)O.K. not really an adaptation since the late great mystery writer P.D. James set it six years after the Wedding. But if you are tired of Matthew Rhys racking up the bodies in “The Americans” try his Darcy. (His on- and offscreen “Americans” co-star Keri Russell is the Mr. Darcy superfan of 2013’s “Austenland” about which the less said the better.) Read a review of “Death Comes to Pemberley.”Rating:PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (2005)Opinions are divided here. If you like your Lizzy more fierce than funny well this one is for you Keira Knightley fans. A tad Brontean for some Janeites who see too much Heathcliff in Matthew Macfadyen’s Darcy. (Carey Mulligan makes her feature-film debut here as the lesser Bennet sister Kitty; she graduates to the villainess in “Northanger Abbey” two years later. See below.) Read a review of “Pride and Prejudice.”Rating:BRIDE AND PREJUDICE (2004)The Bollywood musical version. Watch it for the snappy number “No Life Without Wife.” Read a review of “Bride and Prejudice.”Rating:PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES (2016)There are two sorts of people in this world those who like Jane Austen and those who like zombies. Do not mix. Read a review of “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.”Zero bonnets!
 4454,  1993, a, To the Editor:Your description of child care on the night shift (front page March 14) is one more example of the lengths parents are forced to go to in order to support their families.The Toyota Center is certainly a better alternative than many parents have. Without it the workers you describe would be forced to quit their jobs leave their children home alone or patch together a series of arrangements with the constant worry over whether or not their children are safe and well cared for.Shift work doesn't put undue stress only on children. Shift workers experience higher rates of on-the-job injuries and stress-related illnesses. It's time to look for ways to strike a better balance. In many European countries round-the-clock production is restricted to industries that require continuous operations such as oil refining and chemical production.Rather than continue to organize work as we have always done and simply add child-care centers to the benefits let's ask whether or not there's a better more family-friendly way to protect production and families at the same time. At least overtime should be voluntary and parents who can't work the night shift should be able to bid for day jobs that open up.

 3046,  2001, a, That announcement followed shortly after the demise of 1stUp a Spinway competitor owned by CMGI the Net holding company. 1stUp based in San Francisco was the technology behind free service from Alta Vista and Excite@Home's FreeLane along with dozens of smaller niche services like Gay .com Senior.com and Afronet.com. Shortly after 1stUp's announcement Alta Vista said that it was canceling its free service; other 1stUp partners are still hoping to find a home someplace else.Back in July Juno gobbled up two competitors Freewwweb and WorldSpy both of which declared bankruptcy and then began referring subscribers to Juno's site.That leaves NetZero and Juno still standing as the industry leaders each with 3.7 million active users along with a handful of miscellaneous Web retailers still hoping that sales of merchandise will make up for their free Internet services. But even the two remaining major free providers are walking on rather thin ice these days: like many Internet stocks shares of both Juno and NetZero which are embroiled in patent lawsuits against each other over the way ads are displayed on computer screens have been pummeled in recent weeks. Shares of Juno which traded at $41.63 in January closed under a dollar last week. NetZero was also under a dollar down from a 52-week high of $36.38.Yet rather than disappear entirely analysts predict that free I.S.P. services are likely to continue in some form for those customers who do not overuse them. Many analysts say that tiered pricing programs like those announced by Juno and NetZero are the future and the challenge now is to convert users of the free service into paying customers.Not that long ago Internet customers bought service by the minute much like long-distance telephone service -- for upward of $100 a month for active users. But by the late 1990's most Internet providers in the United States had modified their business models switching to flat monthly fees in an effort to gain more revenue from advertisers and electronic commerce and less from subscriptions. It appeared for some players that eliminating the subscription fee altogether was simply the next step. Adding it back now appears to be yet another one.But it could be that major fee-based services like America Online the Microsoft Network and CompuServe will end up as biggest beneficiaries of the free-I.S.P. shakeout. All three already offer tiered service with limited plans priced as low as at $9.95. As more active users are removed from free services analysts say they may migrate to those more established names rather than pay the amount to a relative newcomer who might not offer the same level of service.NetZero however has considerable brand recognition these days the result of an advertising blitz that includes television spots during N.B.A. games and the company's chairman and chief executive Mark R. Goldston says the company is signing up new subscribers at a record pace.
 7517,  1964, a, Successful operations with two Convair airlines converted from piston‐powered to turbine‐propelled aircraft have prompted Frontier Airlines to convert its entire fleet of Convair 340 planes.Lewis W. Dymond president of the Denver‐based carrier said that when the final conversion unit was delivered during the second quarter of 1966 he company would have a total of 15 CV580's the new designation of the aircraft.The aircraft will represent an investment of $16 million.The CV580 is powered by two General Motors‐Allison 3750‐horsepower turbine engines. It has a complete interior redesign. At 355 miles an hour the aircraft is 100 miles an hour faster than the pistonpowered 340. The converted plane also has three times the rate of climb and can carry eight more passengers for a total of 52.During June July and August Frontier flew two 580's on its scheduled routes and logged more passenger mileage than all 20 of the line's DC‐3's during the same period. Operating costs during the three months fell substantially below those of the 340's.

 4821,  1991, a, Mr. Bush who announced on Tuesday that he would ask Congress to approve favorable new trade terms for the Soviets continued to press for economic reform as a condition for large-scale United States assistance."You must define your own branch of democratic capitalism" he told an attentive group of fledgling Soviet businessmen in a breakfast speech. "People must be free -- to work to save to own their own homes to take risks to invest in each other and in esssence to control their own lives."Mr. Gorbachev for his part has been pressing the United States to ease restrictions on high-technology exports to the Soviet Union.The two leaders spent much of the day at a government retreat 20 miles west of Moscow known as Novo Ogaryevo discussing political issues that still divide their nations. On the agenda were Cuba the size of the Kremlin military budget and the Baltic republics' desire to be independent. There was no indication that the talks were anything but cordial and Soviet television showed the two leaders smiling tieless and wearing pullover sweaters.But what made this week "a dramatic time" as Mr. Gorbachev put it was the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty known as Start and its symbolic termination of the race by the United States and the Soviet Union to amass weaponry with which to blow each other up.Start will reduce the superpowers' stocks of long-range missiles and bombers by about a third. But that will take them back only to roughly the level where they stood as negotiations began in Geneva in 1982 on this the last of the major arms-control agreements conceived in the tensions of the 1970's and 1980's.Nonetheless it is the first agreement ever that calls for the two nations actually to reduce their holdings of the most deadly weapons instead of merely reducing the rate at which those holdings have expanded.

 1130,  2012, a, SPOKANE Wash. — Rick Santorum implied Thursday night that he had won the primary on Tuesday in Michigan where he actually lost the popular vote to Mitt Romney and as of now is behind him in delegates.He did not mention the controversy over the delegates that had sprung up overnight after the Michigan Republican Party changed its rules and instead of awarding an equal number of delegates to both candidates as expected gave two additional delegates to Mr. Romney who won the popular vote with 41 percent compared with Mr. Santorum’s 38 percent.The Santorum campaign on Thursday accused the state party of “thuggery” for changing the delegate rules after the election. It has asked the Republican National Committee to intervene.Mr. Santorum speaking to a crowd of a few hundred people at a megachurch here in advance of the Washington caucuses on Saturday said he had an equal number of delegates and implied that he had won Michigan — at least started winning after Feb. 7 when he won three other contests and voters in Michigan who were casting absentee ballots realized he could be elected. (He has offered no evidence to support that conclusion.)“From the time that we won Colorado Minnesota and Missouri” he said “from that point on we won the vote” in Michigan. “There were absentee ballots filed before that but from that point on we won the vote. Once people looked at our record and his record once people looked at who was the fighter that’s going to go out and charge Washington and change Washington the folks in Michigan voted for Rick Santorum. And we came out of Michigan with the same number of delegates as Governor Romney did – not bad in his home state.”The Santorum campaign had said on Wednesday that it expected to win half the 30 delegates in the state which awards its delegates on a proportional basis by Congressional district. But on Wednesday night the Michigan Republican Party’s Credentials Committee voted 4-to-2 to award two at-large delegates to Mr. Romney giving him a 16-14 delegate advantage.On Feb. 4 the committee had approved a procedure that would have awarded the at-large delegates equally. But Saul Anuzis the former state Republican chairman who is a member of the committee and supports Mr. Romney said in a statement that a memo about how the delegates would be awarded contained an error.The committee’s intention he said was not to award the two at-large delegates proportionally but to give them both to the winner of the statewide popular vote: Mr. Romney.“While we all regret the error in the memo” Mr. Anuzis said “it does not change what was voted on by the committee which was to award the two at-large delegates to the statewide winner.”Although he did not discuss that dispute during his half-hour speech here in Spokane for which he was an hour late the rule change seems to have added to his already palpable sense of grievance against the Republican establishment.In Iowa in January Mr. Santorum actually won the caucuses but because of miscounts Mr. Romney was initially declared the winner. Mr. Santorum has said that not being perceived immediately as the winner and not being able to deliver a victory speech when so many people were watching had denied him subsequent momentum.On Thursday night he portrayed himself as an insurgent candidate going up against the establishment a David against Goliath.“We are running we’re getting outspent everywhere by five six seven to one” he said. “All the big-money guys spending huge amounts of money and anytime you punch back oh they get all upset. ‘Oh he’s unfair. He called eligible voters and asked them to vote in Michigan.’ Wow.”Mr. Santorum was referring to his campaign’s urging of Democrats in Michigan to vote in the Republican primary which some analysts bemoaned as mischievous but which Mr. Santorum defended.Mr. Romney was “out there telling lie after lie after lie” Mr. Santorum said without specifying what he meant “and I went out and actually asked eligible voters to vote and that’s ‘unfair.’ ”“Folks this is the establishment. They don’t like getting into the fight they just like having the money advantage and having their way.”He planned one more rally in Washington State before heading back Friday to Ohio the most important of the 10 states that vote on Super Tuesday next week.

 2225,  2006, a, The latest divisive national question appears to be Was Stephen Colbert funny at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner on Saturday night? Two certainties can be ascertained about Colbert’s performance: The liberal blogosphere loved it and the people in the room didn’t. (If you didn’t catch it on C-SPAN YouTube has the video of Colbert’s routine in three parts here here and here.)Patrick Gavin’s evaluation at the D.C. media blog Fishbowl DC is representative of the consensus among the attendees. He grades it “a mediocre performance” by Colbert. Based on the reaction in the room Gavin suggests “Next candidate for his ‘Who’s Not Honoring Me Now’ segment will probably be the White House Correspondents’ Association.”David Corn Washington editor of The Nation confirms Gavin’s judgment. He writes on his personal blog that while he enjoyed Colbert’s routine “Practically everyone I later surveyed was sour on his performance.”Watching from the comfort of home on the other hand was University of California Los Angeles public policy professor Mark Kleiman who loved Colbert’s appearance. Kleiman calls it an “astonishing rant” that “hit so near the bone … that it drew few laughs despite its superlative excellence both as text and as performance.”But what Kleiman found most notable was Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia’s appreciation of Colbert’s public mockery. Scalia was “laughing hysterically” Kleiman writes “not just a polite ha-ha to show that he got the joke and is being a good sport about it but deep out-of-control impossible-to-fake belly-laughs. He is obviously enjoying — really enjoying — a joke at his own expense. No that doesn’t make up for Bush v. Gore. But it does make Scalia in this one respect a better human being than most of us.”Does that explain the differing reactions? Was the audience in the room uncomfortable with the idea that President Bush didn’t seem to think Colbert was funny? University of Wisconsin law professor Ann Althouse watched from home and she felt the juxtaposition of comic and target was off-putting:I love Colbert but it was a little scary watching him do his “Colbert Report” character outside of his brilliantly comical studio set that frames him as a ridiculous right-wing blowhard. We love the humor in context but when the targets of the humor are there in the room with him we can’t dissolve into hilarity. We’re completely distracted by thinking about how the live audience is reacting …David Frum a former speechwriter and special assistant to President Bush who calls himself “a huge fan” of “The Colbert Report” suggests on his National Review blog that in the presence of an audience of the politicians and reporters who serve as the subjects of his humor the character of “Stephen Colbert” did not seem as buffoonish as he does on his TV show. The problem Frum writes is that Colbert came across as too self-aware:

 3977,  1996, a, The law was changed two years ago to recognize international rights to trademarks but the change does not apply retroactively. The United States wants the 1994 law amended in certain respects to more closely reflect international standards and in effect it wants the changes to be applied retroactively.In an interview last week Robin A. Rolfe executive director of the International Trademark Association in New York said her members were "encouraged by developments in the McDonald's case" in which an agency of the South African Government is siding with the Americans in trying to win back the name. Some companies she said are "pursuing discreet business-political negotiations or considering litigation."She added however that while some South African companies were genuinely using the brands they registered "in other cases the real objective is blackmail" -- the South African owner simply wants the Americans to pay him off.What follows are accounts of how four companies have fared in the fight to reclaim their names.Ronald McDonald Meet Mr. SambonosThe battle is not over yet for McDonald's.George Sambonos owner of the Chicken Licken chain here formed a partnership several years ago with Dax Properties which owns a 20-year-old restaurant in downtown Durban called "Mac donald's" and together they registered the name McDonald's. They also registered the golden arches Big Macs and the Ronald McDonald character that define the American fast-food giant.Last year as the real McDonald's -- the one based in Oak Park Ill. -- was about to open its first branch here Mr. Sambonos sued saying it was infringing his trademark. He also hastily opened a burger outlet called McDonald's in a downtown Johannesburg storefront -- a dingy imitation that did not last long. It was marked by orders stuck to the wall with gummy paste and confused workers serving fries still raw at the center.A local judge ruled that the American McDonald's had lost its trademarks ignoring arguments that Mr. Sambonos's efforts to establish a hamburger chain were not serious.

 5274,  1988, a, Banca Commerciale Italiana said that Italian regulators had indicated that they would approve its bid to buy 51 percent of the Irving Bank Corportion at $80 a share. The offer has the approval of Irving's management and directors and is competing with a hostile offer from the Bank of New York Company. Banca Commerciale's bid must still be approved by the Federal Reserve Board which is expected to take several months.Irving's stock was unchanged yesterday at $62.375 a share or slightly below the $64.81-a-share value of the Bank of New York's offer. The Bank of New York whose stock rose 12.5 cents a share to $31.625 is offering $15 cash and 1.575 of its shares for each Irving share.

 589,  2015, a, PhotoSeason 6 Episode 13: “Dark Money”How awesome would it be to have Lemond Bishop and Kalinda Sharma as your parents? That thought arose near the end of “Dark Money” Sunday night’s episode of “The Good Wife” as the series returned from hiatus for a season-ending 10-week run.In the episode’s tertiary but most engaging plot Lemond called in the favor Kalinda owed him and it didn’t involve stealing evidence or killing a rival drug dealer. He needed her to pick up his son Dylan from school for two weeks and drive him home. Tight-lipped Lemond didn’t say why and Kalinda still nervously calling him sir didn’t ask. But there were obvious dangers: a black SUV following Kalinda and Dylan and a schoolmate bullying Dylan giving him a black eye.It was fun to see Kalinda as surrogate parent throwing the bully up against the school wall worrying about Dylan’s safety and his feelings but also worrying about what Lemond would do to the other boy if he found out. (In an odd glitch the question of the mysterious SUV which we saw several times was simply dropped — presumably to be picked up again in a future episode.) The scenes were sensitively written and benefited from the fact that Mike Colter (Lemond) and Archie Panjabi (Kalinda) have the best chemistry on the show right now at least in an episode where Chris Noth doesn’t appear. (And young Eric Ruffin is excellent as Dylan.)Eventually Kalinda had to make a stand — having effectively snitched on the bully and been dismissed by Lemond she turned around went back to his house and knocked on the door. He of course was in the middle of making a perfectly civil call to the other boy’s father asking him to have a talk with his son. Then he poured a drink for Kalinda and mused to her about being a father. It was a nice if predictable scene — the two damaged tough guys (that’s a gender-free usage) sharing a tender moment. It also paralleled another scene in which Alicia had to make her own decision about standing up for what’s right. More about that later.In the case of the week we had the pleasure of watching Dylan Baker play two roles: his recurring one as the amusingly despicable businessman and probable wife-murderer Colin Sweeney and another as a look-alike actor who had played a Sweeney-like role on a ripped-from-the-headlines television show “Call It Murder.” (That the actor was Australian was perhaps a little dig at current American casting practices.)Sweeney was suing the show for defamation and Diane and Cary were representing him. Having two named partners at the table didn’t satisfy Sweeney who wanted Alicia there too. (Mr. Baker and Julianna Margulies have good chemistry too though in a more comic theatrical manner.) Still busy with her campaign for state’s attorney she couldn’t appear in court but she agreed to help after he blackmailed her by threatening to expose who was funding her political action committee. (It’s Lemond right? I’m sorry but my attention strays whenever the election story line comes up.)After some less plausible than usual twists — including the defense’s abrupt 180-degree shift in strategy from trying to prove that the show wasn’t based on Sweeney’s life to admitting that it was and trying to prove that Sweeney did in fact kill his wife — Sweeney won a public apology with a crucial assist from Alicia. (She noticed that the logo of the Florrick Agos client ChumHum appeared repeatedly in the television episode and apparently this was potentially damaging enough to ChumHum to allow Diane and Cary to threaten a countersuit against the production company. Hmm.)Mr. Baker was as drolly enjoyable as ever and it was entertaining to see Sweeney’s vanity exposed and undercut as he listened to the barrage of testimony against him. Even better was Laura Benanti doing her purring-sex-kitten thing as Sweeney’s current wife who testified against him and had to be bought off. Of course they were nuzzling like newlyweds once the case was settled.One minor aspect of the Sweeney story was to illustrate the continuing can-she-have-it-all question surrounding Alicia’s political campaign — Sweeney blamed her for not being able to give him her time. Oddly there was no echo in the episode of the blistering confrontation among Alicia Diane and Cary at the end of the previous episode in January when Alicia accused them of sexism for not consulting her when they allowed David Lee back into the firm (thereby keeping ChumHum as a client) and they countered that she was distracted and unreachable. Everyone seemed to be getting along fine.The campaign story line was a self-contained episode with a fairly pat moral lesson. Both Alicia and her rival Frank Prady lobbied a crude homophobic sexually harassing Democratic mega-donor and noted supporter of Israel for some off-the-record campaign cash (the “dark money” of the title). The donor a Phoenix-based moneybags named Gus Redmayne was played by Ed Asner who appeared to be enjoying himself immensely. (No immediate real-life models come to mind though the major Republican donor and Israel supporter Sheldon Adelson is based in nearby Las Vegas.)Redmayne who couldn’t keep his hands off Alicia told her he’d give her the money ($1 million) not because she was attractive but because he didn’t like gays. He praised a gay-baiting telephone robo-call that had been paid for by her PAC and said “Kick that fruitcake when he’s down.” (Alicia tried to point out that Prady wasn’t gay but Redmayne wasn’t having it.) When he met with Prady he launched into a vividly phrased description of sex with Alicia.Prady called him disgusting and walked out. Alicia put on a pained smile and took the money. And on top of it she worried that she had once again helped Colin Sweeney win even though it’s almost certain that he killed his wife.The episode ended with a scene that was touching despite some clunky writing mainly because Makenzie Vega as Alicia’s daughter Grace has so fully taken over the role of the show’s moral center. Drinking red wine (the alternating symbol of joy and despair) Alicia sat morosely on the couch as Grace sensitive to her mother’s moods asked how she was doing. Soon a sobbing Alicia was saying “I don’t like when people do bad things” (ouch) and being comforted by her daughter.Alicia: “I was bad today.”Grace: “No Mom you weren’t. You can’t be.”Alicia: “Why? Why can’t I be?”Grace: “Because you’re the best person I know.Is she? The current danger as I see it isn’t that we lose our affection for Alicia because of her compromises but that we lose our interest in her because the campaign plot is so unswervingly dull. It also feels like the writers are trying to have it two ways — Alicia angry resolute and hard-changing at the end of one episode then Alicia sobbing conflicted and in need of comfort the next. Is that a realistic depiction of a character’s complexities or is it inconsistency? (In the previous episode Alicia said Diane would never question her about taking on the campaign if she were a man. Would the producers of “The Good Wife” portray their main character crying on a daughter’s shoulder if he were a man? Sure it’s a completely unfair question — the show’s about a woman and her fight to operate in these male-dominated worlds. But still.)Please tell me how wrong I am and offer any other observations questions and recriminations in the comments. Next week’s episode “Mind’s Eye” is probably an important one. It was written by Michelle and Robert King the show’s creators and directed by Mr. King.

 307,  2017, a, His tenure has been dogged though by suggestions of uneasy relationships with some of his players — most notably Messi — and by accusations that his coaching style does not follow the elegant template laid down at Barcelona by Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola. His meetings with Catalonia’s ravenous news media have also been consistently fractious.Enrique had warned Robert Fernández Barcelona’s sporting director before this season that he might not sign the new contract the club was prepared to offer him. Discussions over that deal had stalled in recent months and it is quite likely that Enrique’s announcement that he would step down did not come as a shock to the club.Barcelona now has three months to identify the most suitable replacement. Ernesto Valverde the experienced coach of Athletic Bilbao has considerable support among Barcelona’s executives as well as his own Barcelona connection: He won the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup as a player for the club in 1989. That his Athletic side beat Barcelona in this season’s Spanish Super Cup could add weight to his case.Jorge Sampaoli the coach of Sevilla is the other leading contender. In his first job in European soccer Sampaoli has turned Sevilla into a genuine contender for the Spanish title and the expansive playing style he prefers is seen by some as dovetailing neatly with Barcelona’s traditions.Sampaoli is also on the cusp of qualifying for the quarterfinals of the Champions League something Barcelona — which was beaten 4-0 in the first leg of its round of 16 matchup with Paris St.-Germain — is unlikely to do.

Mr. Bianchi says his challenger is an opportunist.

 634,  2015, a, How We Got Here
 18,  2019, a, The ongoing tension between Apple and Facebook flared again this week causing a dramatic hubbub in the tech industry. I’d argue it was a nothing burger. Not because it was unimportant but because it’s clear that despite persistent evidence that our privacy is being violated it might not matter.Basically the two digital giants engaged in an esoteric tussle over how Facebook did an end run around Apple’s very strict rules about data use on its app platform in order to suck up more user data. Through an app intended for internal use Facebook paid people — including teenagers — $20 a month to track everything they did online. Since Facebook had been warned about this kind of thing before Apple — noting the move was in “clear breach of their agreement” — retaliated by cutting off the oxygen and Facebook’s access to its own internal apps. It did not as many suggested it should shut off other popular consumer-facing offerings on the iPhone like Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp.Shall I explain more? No I shall not because the details hardly matter except to note that what Facebook did is the equivalent of sneaking out of the house after the curfew your parents imposed after you last sneaked out of the house. To put it more plainly it was obnoxious and squirrelly and just the kind of behavior that we all now assume the company is capable of. Which is to say we don’t trust Facebook in any way when it comes to using and protecting the data we entrust to it.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]And neither does Apple and its chief executive Tim Cook. Mark Zuckerberg the Facebook founder and chief executive is clearly getting on Mr. Cook’s last nerve. I feel a little responsible for the acrimony since it was in an MSNBC interview I did with Mr. Cook in March that the older more seasoned executive decided to go full-bore on the young leadership-challenged one.

 7407,  1964, a, Two men and a woman who allegedly printed and cashed thousands of phony checks were said yesterday to have fleeced businesses here of $250000 in the last four months.The three were arrested on Jan. 18 but their arrests were not announced because of a continuing investigation by the Bronx District Attorney's office. Several more arrests are expected soon.District Attorney Isidore Dollinger said yesterday that the members of the check ring “made remarkably accurate copies of checks.” They used a print shop at 447 East 161st Street directly opposite the Bronx Criminal Court Building he said. The shop was owned by Robert Goodson 30 years old one of the men arrested.Used Genuine I.D. PicturesThe District Attorney said that company checks were usually those copied particularly those of Consolidated Edison and life insurance companies. The members of the ring then printed fake identification cards and fake motor vehicle license and registration forms.

 5399,  1987, a, To the Editor:That accomplished biographer and historian James T. Flexner may indeed be quite correct (Weekend Feb. 13) in believing George Washington ''never kissed a baby.'' It is on record however that at least once this reserved Founding Father unbent enough to give a proferred youngster his blessing with a pat on the head.In a Manhattan shop when Washington Irving (1783-1859) was 6 years old the family's Scottish maidservant saw the General and called attention to the boy announcing as an Irving biographer put it ''Please your Honor here's a bairn named after you.'' Washington responded cooperatively. This memory remained very clear to Washington Irving over a long lifetime as author at the end of which he capped his career so he felt with a well-wrought and well-received biography of the by-then legendary first President.

 625,  2015, a, PhotoIn the world’s crowded earthquake zones from the Himalayas to the Pacific Northwest every community faces enormous challenges in designing for inevitable but unpredictable jolts.This challenge is particularly acute in poor or poorly governed places. And Nepal is both as Ilan Kelman an expert on risk and resilience at University College London made vividly clear in “How earthquake safety measures could have saved thousands of lives in Nepal” a piece on The Conversation website.But there’s much that can be done with education and sustained effort to overcome corrosive forces like corruption in construction practices and oversight and ignorance.Remarkably experts tell me they see signs of progress amid the destruction and carnage in Nepal left by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck 50 miles from Katmandu last Saturday.[Read Chris Buckley’s revealing article on the mix of rapid urbanization and graft that contributed to many building collapses. Track the latest official updates here and here. The latest tally is 160786 houses destroyed and 143673 damaged.]Progress would be a good thing because this earthquake is not nearly Katmandu’s “big one.” A closer quake of similar magnitude is inevitable although seismologists cannot say how soon.The evidence of change is subtle but significant said Kit Miyamoto one of many earthquake engineers scouring the wreckage and — as important — the buildings that did not fall.Miyamoto is a structural engineer from California (and a member of that state’s Seismic Safety Commission) who has been in Katmandu since Tuesday and is helping “red tag” dangerous structures around the city — including a high-rise housing complex that was badly damaged but did not collapse avoiding mass mortality. Preventing deaths is the prime goal in earthquake engineering.PhotoBy Skype Miyamoto told me how even at a “crude building site” he saw a structural engineer’s holy grail – “ductile details” – shorthand for ways to secure parts of the steel-bar skeleton within concrete columns.One critical step involves short pieces of steel rod that are bent and secured around long vertical elements — holding them together like the metal bands wrapping a wooden barrel support the staves. Generations of experience shows that the ends of these encircling bars need to be bent back at least 135 degrees to stay locked together under stress.“Ductile details are a sacred thing” Miyamoto said. “It’s the last line of defense.”PhotoThese are precisely the construction details that were absent in the wreckage of many of the schools that collapsed on students and teachers in China’s Sichuan Province in 2008.Miyamoto said Nepal’s two-decade effort to improve building codes is important but that adoption of new norms and habits by contractors there and in many other developing countries is likely more a function of spreading understanding of why such simple steps make a difference.*“They have to know why that bend matters” he said. “A few extra seconds of effort can keep a building from falling on their kids.”He and others have credited the sustained work of Nepal’s National Society for Earthquake Technology and nonprofit groups such as GeoHazards International in helping spread such insights.But they are racing the clock in many ways. The same is true around the world.The population and building booms in seismic danger zones particularly in poor countries have put millions of people at risk. In a 2013 paper in Science Brian Tucker the founder of GeoHazards International illustrated the problem by noting that the mortality rate of Haitians in areas severely shaken by the 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake was 100 times higher than the rate in areas experiencing similar shaking in Chile’s great earthquake the same year.PhotoIn an excellent Vox piece on earthquake vulnerability Brad Plumer explained the different outcomes found by Tucker:In 1960 a 9.5-magnitude earthquake struck Chile after which the country embarked on a massive earthquake-safety program and enforcing new building codes. By contrast Haiti did nothing during this period lulled into complacency by a lack of seismic activity and hampered by constant political unrest and extreme poverty.(Complacency is not restricted to poor places with infrequent but potent earthquakes. Revisit my posts on Oregon’s slow recognition of the risk posed by the Cascadia fault to get the idea.)In a world webbed by social media there is an enormous emerging opportunity to use peer-to-peer communication to amplify education efforts. (The same networks — via Twitter and Facebook hashtags like #Sindhupalchowk #Nuwakot and #Rasuwa — helped direct emergency helicopter flights to remote villages last week.)[This is particularly important in countries like Nepal where as Pete Spotts reported in the Christian Science Monitor “only about 10 percent of the country’s buildings are designed by engineers – and they typically aren’t even at the construction site as their building rises.”]It’s encouraging to see that the United Nations Development Program office in Nepal has created what amounts to an online course in simple resilient building methods for both urban and rural structures on YouTube. I’ve compiled them in a single playlist at this shortened weblink: j.mp/buildsafernepal.[Hands-on training is important as well. In 2012 the municipal government in Katmandu with the U.N.D.P. ran a workshop for women in masonry methods that can resist earthquake damage.]PhotoThe challenge is tougher in the hinterlands of course. One reason thousands of rural communities peppering the slopes and valleys outside the Katmandu metropolis were particularly hard hit is that they lack access even to wood for construction timbers in the deforested highlands — let alone reinforced concrete.(The vulnerable construction methods in rural communities around Asia prompted the seismologists Roger Bilham and Vinod Gaur to title a 2013 Science paper “Buildings as Weapons of Mass Destruction.”)There are ways to build such housing more securely but many Himalayan communities are only reachable using miles-long footpaths so even bringing in wood from afar is a costly enterprise. There experts are focusing on reinforcing critical structures like schools which can serve as a haven for communities – if they don’t fall down like those in China did.But concrete has to be mixed right — and then there are those ductile details. In such places simpler communication methods can work.A few years back I wrote about an explanatory poster distributed by the thousands in Pakistan after the terrible 2005 earthquake that killed some 80000 people. It was designed by Roger Bilham at the University of Colorado and Rebecca Bendick a geologist at the University of Montana with artwork by Bendick’s grandmother Jeanne Bendick. (You can download the poster here.)PhotoBendick told me that similar posters translated into Creole have been distributed in Haiti through Teachers Without Borders.Such efforts demonstrate that the most important ingredient in making the world’s seismic danger zones safer may not be ductile details or smart phones – but simply the motivation to devote some of one’s time to making sure good ideas get to where they matter.Addendum | Images of Katmandu’s cracked high-rise buildings — which did not topple but if built more sturdily might have been salvageable — appear to be getting the attention of builders and regulators in India. According to the Economic Times there’s a fresh discussion of the need for more stringent building codes for tall buildings which currently are built to the same minimal standard as other structures.Postscript May 4 |Solmaz Mohadjer a University of Tübingen researcher developing the OpenFaultAsia online guide to earthquake faults in Asia sent a comment on the importance of earthquake safety education. She’s been focused on classroom programs in Persian-speaking regions if Asia:One such effort is the ParsQuake initiative which was launched by Teachers Without Borders in 2011. The initiative focuses on training teachers living in earthquake-prone countries of Central Asia as earthquake safety messengers in their schools and the greater community. As part of this initiative my colleagues and I created a teacher’s guide to earthquake education that combines science with hazards information mitigation and planning strategies to give school communities a comprehensive view of earthquakes and their impact on societies. The guide is translated into many languages and can be accessed for free here. We’ve also created a range of different educational material (videos posters etc.) for communicating earthquake information — all included in the ParsQuake link. As part of this initiative we also aim to close the information gap between scientists and the public. This was highlighted in a recent Q&A interview session hosted by PreventionWeb.Here’s a video about the program:[* It’s worth considering the argument in Todd Krainin’s piece over at Reason which posits “In an environment of poverty and corruption rigorous building codes do more harm than good.”]

 5122,  1989, a, To the Editor:I applaud Gian Carlo Menotti for his brilliant use of Mozart to redefine ''artist'' and particularly for his outcry against modern biography which serves up gossip and scandal under pretext of enlarging our understanding of great creators.But in combating that urge to unmask developed by amateur psychologizing since Freud that very frame of mind has betrayed Mr. Menotti into a related failing. He tells us that he forgives Goethe Tolstoy Michelangelo and above all Mozart for their human sins because they gave us great art. Who is he who are we to forgive sins - sins not committed against ourselves? And why should art absolve? or only great art? and Mozart's more than Goethe's?This stock-exchange method of trading off art and morals de-grades them both. With unconscious arrogance one arbitrarily bestows mercy on favorite artists and abandons the rest to their public fate.Meanwhile one stays blind to a small oversight: where in the biographical pillory and the esthetic excuse is there accurate and relevant judgment? Perhaps it is unnecessary. All artists we know are great sinners whereas all ordinary citizens are free of oddities and lead sane and blameless lives. JACQUES BARZUN New York June 10 1989

 2074,  2007, a, UPDATE: Google has responded again to the firestorm raised by this incident saying it shares the concerns Michael Moore raised in his movie.For a while this weekend it looked like Google had chosen to insert itself in the middle of the national debate over healthcare and take on controversial filmmaker Michael Moore.In an official corporate blog a Google employee criticized Mr. Moore’s movie Sicko as one-sided: “Moore’s film portrays the industry as money and marketing driven and fails to show healthcare’s interest in patient well-being and care” wrote Lauren Turner a Health Account Planner at Google.Ms. Turner went on to suggest that Google could help much-maligned health care companies to “Get the Facts” out. How? By buying ads on Google of course.By Sunday after her post raised some eyebrows in the blogosphere Ms. Turner clarified that the opinion about Sicko was hers not Google’s. “Some readers thought the opinion I expressed about the movie Sicko was actually Google’s opinion” she wrote. “It’s easy to understand why it might have seemed that way because after all this is a corporate blog. So that was my mistake — I understand why it caused some confusion.”A Google spokesman told me much the same.But Ms. Turner also said that she stood by her earlier comments that Google stood ready to help anyone whether the healthcare industry or Mr. Moore’s himself: “Whether the healthcare industry wants to rebut charges in Mr. Moore’s movie or whether Mr. Moore wants to challenge the healthcare industry advertising is a very democratic and effective way to participate in a public dialogue” she wrote.That said it’s not clear that Mr. Moore needs to spend money on Google to get his message out.

 5185,  1989, a, Parliament elected Prime Minister Turgut Ozal President today for a seven-year term opening the way for a change of government under a new Prime Minister he will select.In a session boycotted by all 155 opposition members of Parliament 263 deputies from Mr. Ozal's governing Motherland Party voted for him.Fethi Celikbas the only other candidate and a member of Mr. Ozal's party received 14 votes.Mr. Ozal 62 years old was elected on the third ballot after failing to muster the required two-thirds majority of 300 votes in the first two ballots on Oct. 20 and 24. A simple majority was sufficient on the third ballot.Mr. Ozal became Turkey's first civilian President since 1960 and the first Prime Minister to move up to the highly respected but largely ceremonial post. He takes over from President Kenan Evren when his term expires Nov. 9.
 5096,  1989, a, The flutist Paula Robison presided over a lively evening of Baroque chamber music in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Saturday evening. Her partners in the endeavor were Kenneth Cooper harpsichordist; Martha Caplin and Carol Zeavin violinists; Linda Moss violist; Annabelle Hoffman cellist and Sara Thompson bassist.The setting played a distinct role in the performance. Apart from its visual stimulation the Medieval Sculpture Hall is an exceptionally resonant space and its reverberance lent a firmness to Miss Robison's tone which can sound breathy in drier halls.Miss Robison began with Jean-Jacques Rousseau's solo flute arrangement of ''Spring'' from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons.'' An inventive version that uses alterations of registration and coloration to suggest the rest of the orchestra it captures the spirit if not quite the detail of the original. In any case it is impossible to prevent the inner ear from filling in the missing lines and it served as a nice vehicle for Miss Robison's graceful virtuosity.In two other Vivaldi concertos -''Il Gardellino'' and ''Con Sordini'' -and in Bach's Suite No. 2 in B minor Miss Robison was accompanied by her full ensemble. Her solo lines were tastefully embellished and invariably played with spirit and her ensemble faithfully matched her energy and her stylish approach to phrasing. The one movement that might have raised an eyebrow or two was the Badinerie of the Bach Suite which was played at a perilous speed.
 2582,  2004, a, NASA has made sufficient progress modifying the space shuttle fleet to warrant growing confidence that the spacecraft can safely resume flying next spring space agency officials said Friday.Wayne Hale deputy manager of the shuttle program said that while much more work needed to be done ''we have made significant progress across the board.''Mr. Hale said the pace of shuttle modifications included enough reserve time to complete everything by next spring.The remaining three space shuttles have been grounded since the Columbia disintegrated in the atmosphere upon re-entry on Feb. 1 2003 resulting in the loss of its seven-member crew. The investigation board attributed the accident to a piece of fuel tank foam hitting the edge of a wing and damaging it in the launching and a breakdown in management procedures at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

 4269,  1994, a, Yet with half the season remaining the Knicks have the same record as Houston and they are just one game behind Seattle. And the SuperSonics have a lot to think about after being manhandled on their home floor Saturday by the Knicks 106-92.Last season the Knicks were only 26-15 through 41 games before rolling to a 34-7 record in the second half of the season. One of New York's goals this season is to finish with the National Basketball Association's best record. The Knicks face the most difficult part of their schedule during the next five weeks but by winning 10 of their last 12 games they appear poised for a strong second half."Yes I'm pleased with where we are" said Coach Pat Riley. "At one time this season we only had six players healthy enough to practice. We've managed to keep our heads above water. There's every reason to believe that our best basketball is ahead of us." Harper Fitting InSeveral signs indicate that Riley may be correct. Anthony Mason plagued by nagging injuries all season finished the West Coast trip with two strong games. Smith has been more assertive since returning six games ago. Not only has Smith attacked the basket aggressively but he has added a 3-point jumper to his arsenal. His offensive ability and 6-foot-10-inch size force most teams to double-team him which creates openings for other players.Derek Harper has begun to feel comfortable in the Knicks' offense. He went through the same process that most players who are traded go through. He hesitated to shoot and he was tentative because he was not familiar with the offense. But on Sunday Harper played his best game since being traded to the Knicks by the Mavericks on Jan. 6. Harper scored 22 points on 7-for-10 shooting giving New York a new outside threat at the point-guard position. Riley said he hoped to create more options in the offense for Harper as the coach became more familiar with Harper's game.

 1221,  2012, a, NASATUESDAY’S PUZZLE — I thought this one was wheelie interesting. I’m sorry I’ll try again: I never once grew tired of doing Ethan Cooper’s puzzle. Darn it it’s only the first paragraph and already I’m stealing all of your puns. I’m not worried though; I know you’ll come up with at least a few of your own.Mr. Cooper’s puzzle does not have a punny theme but it SPOKE to me (sorry it’s hard to stop once you get started.) All three of the theme entries plus the payoff at 48 Across make their debuts today giving a sense of freshness to a “parts of these phrases are components of the payoff” theme that we’ve all seen before.I hinted in Sunday’s post that I have had a somewhat mercurial relationship with my car and at least some of that is because of the spontaneous flat tires that it tends to have. My personal opinion on this automotive quirk is that the car is telling me that it likes the particular destination we’ve arrived at and doesn’t want to leave. This is why I am obsessive about keeping up my AAA membership. It is no fun trying to drive home on one’s RIMSKY-KORSAKOVs.In nontheme news I liked the entries SUCKED UP CREW CUTS and HOT MIKES. Just one question: UNRIP? I don’t see that as “Tear open” as much as “quickly reseal something you’ve already torn open” but maybe that’s just me.Feeling puzzle weary this early in the solving week? Surely you JEST. But don’t call me Shirley.Your thoughts?
 3664,  1998, a, There is now little doubt that AIDS is becoming an epidemic of color striking the African-American community to a disproportionate and devastating degree. Yet neither political leaders nor black institutions anticipated this demographic shift early enough to protect a vulnerable population that historically has been neglected in health care and prevention.Recent data from 25 states compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that African-Americans account for 57 percent of new infections with H.I.V. the virus that causes AIDS even though they make up only 13 percent of the United States population. While death rates from AIDS have dropped for all groups the declines have been much greater among whites than blacks. Young blacks fare even worse. In data collected between January 1994 and June 1997 blacks accounted for 63 percent of infected individuals between the ages of 13 and 24.At the same time the disease is becoming more prevalent among women of all races who account for more than a quarter of new infections. Young women who make up 44 percent of those infected between the ages of 13 and 24 are especially hard hit. The changing face of the disease from one with a vocal and educated constituency of gay men to one afflicting poor minorities women and teen-agers raises new challenges for prevention efforts.As the demographics change the Government's AIDS policies must change as well. Expansion of needle exchange programs safer-sex education in schools and drug treatment efforts would help slow the virus's spread into new groups through needles and sexual contact. But posturing in Congress has blocked these common-sense measures leaving desperate communities even more vulnerable to the epidemic. Efforts by the Centers for Disease Control to direct some AIDS prevention funds to agencies serving minorities should be expanded substantially.

 5467,  1987, a, The United States which has portrayed Iran as the main aggressor in the Persian Gulf war has strongly protested Iraq's renewed attacks on Iranian targets State Department officials said today.But Iraq's Ambassador to the United States Nizar Hamdoon said that despite the American protest Iraq would continue its attacks on Iranian offshore oil installations and ships carrying Iranian oil in the gulf.''Iraq never promised anybody we were going to stay idle for a specific time'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We share the Americans' concern but we have the right to decide our own policy.'' Iran Attacks Kuwaiti ShipAs Iraq carried out air raids for the third straight day today against Iranian oil targets in the gulf an Iranian speedboat opened fire with machine guns on a Kuwaiti freighter. The attacks took place as the latest American-escorted convoy of re-registered Kuwaiti tankers headed up the gulf. [ Page A6. ] American officials said it was feared that the new attacks by Iraq might cause Iran to retaliate against the United States convoys.
 4475,  1993, a, UNITED STATES GYPSUM is back. Of course its products were never gone but the industrial company that made big profits in the mid-80's fell out of favor with many investors after 1988. That year it borrowed $2.5 billion to pay the holder of each of its shares of stock a $42 dividend to ward off a takeover bid.The debt coupled with a steep drop in construction activity and lower demand for gypsum products was too great a burden. In January 1991 USG the holding company for United States Gypsum and other divisions that was created in a 1985 reorganization defaulted on bond payments.After taking two years or so to reorganize on a more solid financial footing USG emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month minus $1.4 billion of debt. Interest charges were reduced to $170 million a year from $320 million.So far the new company has not aroused much enthusiasm among investors. It began trading on May 21 at $11 a share on the New York Stock Exchange and closed Friday at $10. At that price analysts say the shares are a good value even though the company is a long way from regaining its financial health of the early- and mid-80's.
 3767,  1997, a, A Test for Christ the KingFor the last seven seasons Christ the King's nationally ranked girls' basketball team left little doubt that St. John Vianney an elite team from New Jersey was not on the same level.Christ the King ranked 16th in the nation by USA Today has won all 11 meetings since they began playing in 1990.''Christ the King has such a great program that very few teams can match up with them'' Bill Bulman a St. John Vianney assistant coach said. ''They have always held a great advantage over us in the size and strength department.''However when St. John Vianney (11-0) the six-time defending state champion from Holmdel N.J. travels across state lines today to take on Christ the King (12-2) in Middle Village Queens at 7:30 P.M. those advantages are expected to be no greater than the distance between a thumb and a bent index finger.

 4463,  1993, a, The 15th Duke of Bournemouth has never had an easy time of it. When he was a baby in the 1960's his father the hippie 14th duke and his American mother mislaid him in a restaurant. As an adult named Tommy (Eric Idle) the adopted son of a Pakistani family living in London he continues to get the short end of the stick. He's a passive fellow until the day he finds out that he's the rightful heir to the Bournemouth title.It's then that Tommy takes action. He schemes to kill off the bogus 15th duke a nervy American nitwit named Henry (Rick Moranis) who also happens to be his best friend. Though it's never really clear how Henry fell into his good fortune don't look cockeyed gift horses in the mouth.It makes no difference that "Splitting Heirs" a brisk new English farce has a plot more hysterically convoluted than that of "The Big Sleep." The film is a genial entertainment in the Monty Python tradition a series of madly illogical sequences that even include something a screen card identifies as "Hindu Dream Sequence."As written by Mr. Idle and directed by Robert Young (an English film maker not to be confused with the American director of the same name) "Splitting Heirs" rambles with spirit and speed. The jokes and comedy routines are often intentionally awful ("I'm bisexual; whenever I want sex I buy it") and sometimes hilarious even though not entirely new.
 1537,  2010, a, Linda Greenhouse on the Supreme Court and the law.Brendan Smialowski/Getty ImagesEveryone will have a favorite moment from Elena Kagan’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing: the nominee’s crack about spending Christmas Day in a Chinese restaurant for example or Senator Tom Coburn’s too-clever-by-half effort to draw out her views on the constitutionality of the health-care mandate by asking whether Congress could require every American “to eat three vegetables and three fruits every day.” (Of course Solicitor General Kagan knew what the Oklahoma Republican was driving at but she wasn’t about to play. “It sounds like a dumb law” she replied.)My own favorite came during Senator Charles Grassley’s opening round of questions on Tuesday afternoon. He quoted back to Ms. Kagan from an interview she gave to a magazine in 2004 which she had made the daring observation that “the attitude and views that a person brings to the bench make a difference.” So what were her attitudes and views and how would they make a difference the Iowa Republican wanted to know.Was this so deliciously early in the proceedings the gotcha moment in which the former dean of Harvard Law School would have to reveal her inner wise Latina?Not exactly. All she meant was that “different justices approach constitutional interpretation differently approach statutory interpretation differently” the nominee explained earnestly. She herself had no “grand theory” she said adding that she believed in looking at a mix of text history tradition precedent and underlying principles.“The attitudes and view that you have how will they make a difference in how you will reach a decision?” the senator persisted.In reply Ms. Kagan offered that the approach she had just described “might be different than some other people’s. Some people have that approach. Some people have a different approach. And those differences do matter.”Senator Grassley decided that it was time to move on to the next item on his checklist. “Okay I’d like to go to the Second Amendment” he said.Aside from demonstrating Elena Kagan’s facility at avoiding obvious hazards this colloquy also illustrates a basic dynamic of Supreme Court confirmation hearings: the inability of most senators – there are exceptions – to sustain a line of questioning once their talking points run out. If nominees stick to their own story (or non-story) most senators will eventually have to give up. Ms. Kagan’s reference to text history precedent and principle actually offered a fair amount of substance to explore but only by a senator prepared to hold those concepts up to the light and shake them a bit to see what they contain.Many have already remarked on Ms. Kagan’s disavowal of her 1995 article that criticized the confirmation process in pithy terms and urged nominees to be more forthcoming about their views. I have already cheered the sentiment that the article expressed. Now that I’ve watched several Republican senators use the legacy of Justice Thurgood Marshall for whom Ms. Kagan clerked as a piñata – to say nothing of Senator Jeff Sessions’ interminable effort to reignite the culture wars by picking over the dry bones of the military recruiting controversy – I’ve gained sympathy for the strategy that counsels nominees to say as little as possible and just get the thing over with. And I give Ms. Kagan points for taking several opportunities to observe that judging is not a robotic exercise but one that actually requires judgment.Still I’m left with the feeling that a hearing like this represents a lost opportunity for the public to actually learn something about how judges think about what the Constitution means. Ms. Kagan declared early on that “it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to talk about what I think about past cases – you know to grade cases – because those cases might again come before the court.” If any senator directly challenged that premise I missed it. It deserves to be challenged not only because it cuts off a fruitful line of questions but because it isn’t logical.“A hearing like this represents a lost opportunity for the public to actually learn something about how judges think about what the Constitution means.”Ms. Kagan’s concern like that expressed by the many nominees before her who took the same position evidently was that “grading” a past case would somehow compromise her ability to rule impartially when the next case based on the same legal principle reached the court. But how could that be? Justices who sit on one case are not disqualified by virtue of that fact from sitting on the next case that concerns the same legal principles. Justice Antonin Scalia’s repeated criticism of Roe v. Wade including personal statements in opinions urging his colleagues to overrule it does not disqualify him from sitting in future abortion cases. Justice Marshall’s strong objection to the Supreme Court’s death penalty jurisprudence – he believed the death penalty is unconstitutional under all circumstances – did not disqualify him from participating in the steady stream of death penalty cases that reached the court during his tenure.My Yale Law School colleagues Robert Post and Reva Siegel published an article four years ago urging the Senate to question Supreme Court nominees on their views of past cases. The point would not be to extract promises of future behavior but to probe the nominees’ “present understanding of the law” and “force substantive constitutional differences into the open.” From a litigant’s point of view “there is no pertinent difference” between being judged by a justice who wrote the authoritative opinion in an area of the law and “a new justice who has in a confirmation hearing recounted how he would have voted” in that case the two law professors wrote. They added that “nominees who explain the grounds on which they would have voted in an already decided case do not prejudge future cases any more than do judges who write or join opinions in actual cases.”Under those rules of the game we presumably would have heard a different answer from the one Ms. Kagan gave to Senator Herb Kohl’s question of whether the Supreme Court should have involved itself in the 2000 election case that became Bush v. Gore. What she said was: “The question of when the court should get involved in election contests in disputed elections is I think one of some magnitude that might well come before the court again.” Perhaps feeling that there was more to say she added helpfully “It’s hard to think of a more important question in a democratic system and maybe a tougher one.”Exactly.•Ed Bailey/Associated PressI will conclude this column with a brief reflection on the passing of Martin D. Ginsburg Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s husband of 56 years who died on Sunday at the age of 78. He was a man far ahead of his time as a partner in a marriage of equals. The obituaries stressed his sense of humor and his skill as a chef. He was also one of the country’s top tax lawyers. I’m sure he would have excelled in any area of the law but he happened to be passionate about tax law.He once mentioned that he planned to attend a Supreme Court argument in an obscure tax case in which I had absolutely no interest and asked me if I would be there. “Marty” I replied “I wouldn’t go to that argument if it was the only case on the docket.” The expression on his face registered not only shock and disbelief but – I’m quite sure – wounded feelings to think that anyone could have so little regard for the Internal Revenue Code. He proceeded to explain the case to me in hugely entertaining detail. I’ve chuckled ever since whenever I hear the phrase “Subchapter S corporation.”Marty Ginsburg was famously devoted to his wife and to her career but it was not always easy. In a speech a few years ago he recounted an incident that occurred in 1980 soon after Ruth Ginsburg took her seat on the federal appeals court in Washington:“An important-looking fellow we did not know came up and encouraged to ‘say hello to Judge Ginsburg’ stuck out a manicured hand turned to me and said with much enthusiasm ‘Oh Judge Ginsburg I’ve heard so much about you!’ I grasped his hand with the greatest warmth and responded ‘Actually she’s Judge Ginsburg but I remain hopeful.’”

 6011,  1978, a, An experimental reorganization of the detective operation in Queens which would place all investigators under the authority of the uniformed borough commander is being studied by New York City police authorities.Under the .arrangement the current precinct investigation units would be given expanded responsibilities to investigate more important crimes than they do now. There would also be borough homicide robbery and sex squads that would be under a detective supervisor who would report not to the chief of detectives at headquarters but to the uniformed borough commander.The change would remove nearly 200 detectives in Queens from the jurisdiction of the central detective bureau. Under the plan the bureau would also be given additional investigative responsibilities now carried “out by other divisions.An Issue of ControversyThe move is part of an effort by Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire to improve the department's investigative capability. The current detective setup introduced in 1972. has been the center of recurring controversy with critics contending that it has resulted in a fragmentation of demand and weakened performance.

 5645,  1986, a, To the Editor:While I'm sure Dr. Stephen G. Baum's medical credentials are impeccable he must be aware that he exhibits certain nonprofessional prejudices in his statement that the common denominator in the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been promiscuity (letter Oct. 21). Certainly it contributes; promiscuity also increases your chance of getting other diseases including the common cold.It was a loaded statement tantamount to saying that those who get AIDS deserve it for their life style. My layman's knowledge of the disease is that it is contracted by a virus entering the bloodstream. Are hemophiliac children who are unfortunate enough to receive tainted blood transfusions promiscuous? Can Dr. Baum state categorically that the disease could never be contracted via one exposure or that a person having sex two times a year might unluckily choose the wrong partners?I fully concur that AIDS education should be a part of sex education and that promiscuity will increase the risk of contracting contagious and infectious diseases. But indirectly labeling AIDS victims as promiscuous is unfortunate and certainly inaccurate. CHARLES ALMON Brooklyn Oct. 22 1986

 2530,  2004, a, This is unfortunate because the teen years are a time when sports participation can have its greatest benefits. Multiple studies show that children who participate in sports are less likely to smoke consume illegal drugs and alcohol miss classes drop out of school and become pregnant. In addition for those involved in sports self-esteem tends to rise and the ability to solve problems handle adversity and be creative improves.''I think the biggest problem is that kids don't make the high school team or the junior high school team and drop out'' said Richard Lapchick founder of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. ''Kids think that if they don't make the team that their career is over therefore they should stop competing or playing or doing anything that makes them physically fit.''The common perception is that the United States is a sports-crazed country that believes strongly in the value of sports for our youth. But when you peel back the layers of the onion you see that what we really value is elite sports programs. From the professional level to traveling club teams for 8-year-olds our focus as a society is on elite athletes. Resources start being directed toward programs for elite athletes when children are young.''There's a disparity in sports the fact that there is so much at the top and not enough at the bottom'' said Tom McMillen a former congressman and N.B.A. player. ''If you look at America we have very few resources at the bottom for our kids. We certainly have plenty of resources at the top. We can build megastadiums pay megasalaries for athletes but we're not doing enough at the bottom.''Drew A. Hyland author of ''Philosophy of Sport'' (Paragon House 1990) sees part of the solution overseas. ''I think a wonderful thing would be for the United States to develop a more active sports club system of the sort that you see in Europe where folks keep on playing actively in leagues and so forth on into adulthood'' Hyland said.In most European countries there is a sports club for everyone. If you are a premier athlete there is a team for you. If you are an athletically challenged kid but still love the game there is also a team for you. Clubs in Europe will often have an ''A'' team a ''B'' team a ''C'' team on down so everyone is accommodated.To change the disturbing decline in the physical fitness in America we need to do a better job spreading the word about the poor state of our children's physical fitness and the long-term impact that will have on their health. We must have more physical education in our schools not less. And we need more recreation intramural and club programs that provide organized sports opportunities for all ages and levels of ability.As parents administrators legislators teachers and coaches it is up to us to find ways to get more children involved and keep them participating longer. Will it be physical fitness or physical ''fatness'' for our youth?
 1452,  2010, a, It is a long-standing tradition that presidents send letters of condolence to the families of troops killed at war whether by enemy fire accident or illness. But since the Clinton administration at least one group has not received those hand-signed notes: families of troops who committed suicide even those who killed themselves while deployed to a war front.It turns out though that on at least one occasion a president has made an exception to the no-letter protocol.In 2005 20-year-old Pfc. Jason Scheuerman killed himself while in Iraq with the 3rd Infantry Division. His father Chris Scheuerman a retired Army master sergeant said his son had been struggling with depression and doubts about the war and had sought counseling in the weeks before he died. But an Army psychologist who had not yet received his license to practice declared that Private Scheuerman might be feigning problems.His commanding officers decided he was a “malingerer” records obtained by Mr. Scheuerman showed and sent him back to his unit. He was given back his weapon but denied access to the Internet and telephone. About three weeks later he shot himself after tacking a note to his closet door that read “I know you think I’m a coward for this but in the face of existing as I am now I have no other choice.”After learning about his son’s death Mr. Scheuerman assumed that he would receive a letter from the president. When none arrived he inquired with the White House and was subsequently told of the no-letter policy for suicides.That policy government officials have said is based on concerns among senior military leaders that presidential letters of condolence might appear to condone or even encourage suicide.Mr. Scheuerman wrote back arguing that the protocol was wrongheaded particularly at a time when the Defense Department was trying to slow a rising tide of suicides. Last year there were more than 300 suicides by active-duty military personnel members the most since the Pentagon started keeping track in 1980. While most suicides occur on military bases in the United States more than 184 troops have killed themselves while deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001.“The fact that we continue the policy we continue to stigmatize soldiers who suffer from mental illness” Mr. Scheuerman said in a recent interview. “And we continue to punish the families of soldiers who succumb to the trauma of mental illness that nine years of war has cumulatively heaped upon them.”The White House did not respond to Mr. Scheuerman’s second letter. But in late 2005 the son of the Indianapolis Colts’ coach Tony Dungy committed suicide and President George W. Bush sent him a letter of condolence.“I pray for you” the president wrote in a letter that was read at James Dungy’s funeral. “May God keep you. May his light shine upon you.”Mr. Scheuerman fired off a hand-written note to the White House asking why the son of a military family should be treated differently from the son of a professional football coach. (In addition to Mr. Scheuerman and his son Jason Mr. Scheuerman’s wife oldest son and other members of his extended family have served in the military.)“Not taking away from the tragedy the Dungy family had experienced I felt we had given a whole lot more and sacrificed a great much more for our nation’s safety than a football coach” Mr. Scheuerman said in an interview.A few weeks later in March 2006 a letter from the White House arrived at the Scheuerman home in Sanford N.C. near Fort Bragg where Mr. Scheuerman worked at the time.“Laura and I are saddened by the loss of your son Jason” the letter signed by President Bush said. “We know this has been a difficult time for you and we send our heartfelt sympathy.”Mr. Bush’s letter to Mr. Scheuerman surfaced only recently after he shared it with an Indianapolis man Gregg Keesling whose son committed suicide in Iraq last year. In an e-mail message Mr. Keesling said he hoped that Mr. Bush’s letter would show that presidents have the flexibility to send letters based on a service member’s record not on how the service member died.“My son and probably the vast majority who die by suicide had honorable service” he wrote.At Mr. Keesling’s behest two congressmen from Indiana have urged the Obama administration to modify the no-letter policy. White House aides say it is under review.
 1110,  2012, a, INDIANAPOLIS — If Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski can’t play in Super Bowl XLVI because of a high ankle sprain there might not be anyone to fill his shoes.It feels like tempting fate for the Patriots who streamrolled the league with their dual threats — Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez — but they have no other tight ends on the active roster. Carson Butler has been stashed on the practice squad for 16 months.The New England tight ends coach Brian Ferentz agrees that it is an odd situation.“You are living a little dangerously at times when most of our offense is geared toward having two tight ends out there” Ferentz said. “My argument is that the offense never changes just the people who are in there.”But the Patriots haven’t been satisfied with most of their other options waiving tight ends Will Yeatman and Dan Gronkowski and offensive tackle Thomas Welch who lined up as an eligible receiver at times. Those duties have been handed to the rookie offensive tackle Nate Solder who started at tight end for two seasons with the University of Colorado.“I’ve been flexible” said Solder who is primarily a blocker when he serves as the third tight end. “I’ve been playing all sorts of different positions and I just go in wherever they need me.”He may have to go in often Sunday although Hernandez doesn’t seem too worried about Gronkowski who has not practiced this week after leading the N.F.L. with 17 receiving touchdowns.“Everybody needs to step up if Rob isn’t 100 percent because he draws so much attention and is such a threat on the field” Hernandez said. “I think he’ll play. I think he’ll be a big impact in this game.”And on the other sideline? The Giants have kept three tight ends — Jake Ballard Bear Pascoe and Travis Beckum — on their active roster all season despite relying on their wide receivers for the downfield passing game.

 4519,  1993, a, Agassi clawed his way back into contention after he suddenly began connecting with his bludgeonlike forehands and he took full command in the fourth set's tie breaker. But when he dropped his serve after he lept twirled and dropped a fancy backhand volley into the net at break point in the sixth game of the final set he never recovered. Game Plan Rendered WorthlessOnce Enqvist held for 5-2 Agassi wilted under the pressure on his own serve: a wild backhand sent the duel to match point and Enqvist converted it with an uncatchable forehand."We had a game plan but if you're not sharp it doesn't matter" said Agassi who felt let down by his backhand and undermined by Enqvist's strong service games which produced 20 aces and enabled him to save all but five of the 16 break points Agassi held.Agassi whose next assignment is protecting the United States Davis Cup team from expulsion from elite competition in 1994 said he wasn't yet sure how to regroup. He's trying to adopt Segura's more thoughtful approach to competition but is now uncertain about sabotaging his reflexes with rumination."It's a Catch-22 a big debate in my mind" Agassi said. "How much do I just rely on instincts and how much do I have a clue as to what I'm doing? Either way I should win a match like this."Enqvist in contrast to Agassi has been a late bloomer. In 1991 while Agassi was battling in a final at the French Open so too was Enqvist who wound up the runner-up in the junior boy's competition. Enqvist was the top junior in the world that year which also happened to be the year the 15-year-old Capriati reached the semifinals of both the French and United States Opens. Acceptance of BlameThis year Capriati had gained the quarterfinal rounds at the Australian French and Wimbledon only to lose to Steffi Graf on each occasion. Like Agassi she had high hopes here.

 5493,  1987, a, AS a trial lawyer and formal Federal prosecutor Raymond B. Grunewald has earned a reputation as a tough and savvy courtroom foe.As the Democratic candidate for Nassau County Executive Mr. Grunewald has borrowed some courtroom tactics - in desperation some critics say - to make a withering cross-examination of the Republican incumbent Thomas S. Gulotta and the party's powerful Nassau organization.''Gulotta is a total cipher who is governing this county by proclamation'' said Mr. Grunewald alluding to Mr. Gulotta's incessant public appearances where he often presents county citations and awards.''The Nassau Republican machine is an arrogant monopoly that no longer is working for the people'' he said citing the garbage traffic and ground-water problems facing the county.
 2980,  2002, a, In a two-hour meeting today with Donald Fehr the executive director of the union Yankee players discussed the pros and cons of possible strike dates but did not discuss a firm date.One player said the Yankees talked about the strategies associated with different strike dates. But Fehr said ''The board has not considered a strike date or when it would be.''Players generally expressed some optimism after the meeting and those who were active during the last work stoppage in 1994-95 said the overall atmosphere was better now. Robin Ventura said he had ''guarded optimism'' and Sterling Hitchcock said the issues dividing the players and the owners do not seem as substantial as they did eight years ago.''I think it's just a matter of whether the people who are going to the table want to do it'' he said. ''Last time around they were really wanting to change the system and they got what they wanted the last time as far as luxury taxes and revenue sharing. To me now it's just tinkering with numbers. It doesn't seem like it is as tough a battle this time. It's just a matter of the willingness.''

 2138,  2007, a, I never thought there was going to be any sort of nostalgia for childhood in the 1970s a time of skyrocketing divorce “latch key kids” and newly liberated adults who sometimes behaved rather badly toward their much less with-it offspring.Yet now with middle age encroaching upon the girls who cut their hair like Dorothy Hamill and carried lunchboxes that sported the face of the original Bionic Woman the seventies are coming back to life and looking a whole lot better in retrospect.Last month American Girl introduced Julie of 1974 the latest doll in the company’s “historical” line with a set of accompanying books written by the children’s author and seventies girl Megan McDonald and filled with fun facts about Shirley Chisholm the ERA Title IX Billie Jean King and the etymology of Ms.This week came “The Daring Book for Girls” the work of two almost-middle-aged writers whose goal they told me wasn’t just to complement the mega blockbuster “The Dangerous Book for Boys” but also to offer an escape route out of the high-pressure perfectionist media-saturated and competitive world of girlhood in our time. The way they do it: by offering up an alternative kind of girl culture that looks and sounds a whole lot like … life in the 1970s.“The Daring Book for Girls” teaches the art of playing jacks and handclap games roller skating darts jump rope gin rummy and daisy chains. There’s fun and old-fashioned feminism: “Putting Your Hair Up With a Pencil” and “A Short History of Women Inventors and Scientists.” Instead of e-mail instant messaging group weigh-ins or slumber parties organized around “America’s Next Top Model” the authors offer instructive chapters on “Clubhouses and Forts” “Writing Letters” “Telling Ghost Stories” and “Fourteen Games of Tag.”There’s “How to Negotiate A Salary” “Every Girl’s Toolbox” “Public Speaking” and “Finance: Interest Stocks and Bonds” (favorites of mine). My daughter Julia – a target “tween” – went wild over “Reading Tide Charts” “Vinegar and Baking Soda” and “Making a Willow Whistle.”“We looked at what we ourselves enjoyed doing” said author Andrea J. Buchanan. “We asked ourselves: what should girls know?” added co-author Miriam Peskowitz. “And we went from there.”Unlike “The Dangerous Book for Boys” which harkens back to a prelapsarian state of boyhood that some have dated to the 1950s and others to Edwardian England “The Daring Book for Girls” can’t be too backward-looking. After all the 1950s weren’t really a heyday for girl power. The 1970s too Buchanan and Peskowitz acknowledged had their frustrations and limitations for the girls on the very cusp of social change. But the era of their girlhood the authors believe was overall less toxic.“Girls have more opportunities now” Peskowitz said. “But the culture is more horrid. Girls jump into womanhood at nine. It may have been more fun in some ways to have been a girl in 1963 or 1973 without the pressures.”“The Dangerous Book for Boys” spent 20 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and is slated to become a Disney film. If the “Daring” book does anywhere nearly as well then it could mark the start of a pop culture re-imagining of modern girlhood – one perhaps with an emphasis on doing rather than seeming on growing rather than shrinking and on exploring rather than shutting down.That would be nice. If only.If only with its faux-antique binding black and white etchings and Girl Scout Handbook-like straightforwardness “Daring” didn’t have the persistent feel of a reliquary. If only my own tween’s enthusiasm for it (“Will you help me put up my hair with a pencil?”) weren’t a sign that it’s not going to play well with the Hannah Montana crowd. If only my own admiration for it wasn’t pretty much the kiss of death: the Geek seal of approval. (“Girls” I breathed misty-eyed in the car recently. “Just think: one day you’ll have a lot of homework and we can all go to the library together and share a table!”)Peskowitz who has a Ph.D. in ancient history and religion may find it a thrill to apply her professional knowledge to teaching girl readers about “Queens of the Ancient World.” Other mothers may find similar ways to communicate the passions of their lives – poetry or chemistry or camping — to their girls via the “Daring” book’s pages. Yet while all this will undoubtedly strengthen individual mother-daughter bonds I wonder if it will have any wider effect. What power can any of us – moms and daughters adrift in the cultural mainstream — have against the hugely seductive hypnotic machine that has brought us Paris Miley Lindsay and more?Not much — unless there are a whole lot more of us out there than I think.A family counselor I heard speak last Spring said she believes that young girls today who get caught up in skinniness fashion popularity pop culture and boys are essentially “underemployed.” Their brains she said need to be engaged by things larger than themselves: things like hobbies sports art music or community service. If they’re not there’s a vacuum and all kinds of wretched stuff comes to fill their minds instead.I thought of this woman’s words on Halloween catching glimpses trick or treating of the tweens dressed in this year’s much-talked-about “bawdy” attire or simply in costumes that were more fashion-y than fun. These girls were striking. There was a self-consciousness to them an inward-turnedness that was joyless and disturbing. It was way too adult-like and way too heavy a thing for their young and (invariably) skinny shoulders to bear.I don’t know exactly how we can relieve them of the burdens of toxic girlhood. We can’t – and shouldn’t – raise them in a total media vacuum. We can’t simply preach at them or badger them or cloister them or dress them in the kind of puppy-dotted turtlenecks that are now showing up in some nostalgia-stoking holiday catalogues.The only thing we can do is provide some sort of inspiration – of a kind of womanhood that makes them want to connect to the better aspects of the girlhood we once knew. And then give them the space and the time to make it their own.

 5084,  1989, a, To the Editor:It is difficult to understand why the basis of our protests against United States Surgical Corporation is consistently misreported (news story March 3). The company operates on live dogs in hundreds of sales demonstrations to promote use of its surgical staplers to doctors. Board-certified surgeons are trained in all wound-closure methods. United States Surgical is not a medical school; it is a commercial enterprise that kills dogs to make sales. That has nothing to do with surgical training. It has everything to do with animal abuse.More to the point would be a report on our efforts and legal actions to have the company's Connecticut lab license revoked so that this vivisection for profit can be stopped. The case is now on appeal and the truth may soon be recognized as expert opinion is brought to bear.Yes there are larger issues involved but none larger than the cutting up and killing of dogs for corporate profits.

 5271,  1988, a, Unusually spirited and rythmically alert Bach playing was the unifying thread of a stimulating organ recital by Kei Koito at the Church of St. John the Evangelist Monday evening.Miss Koito played four works of the Thomaskantor - an early Vivaldi concerto transcription (BWV 593) the canonic variations on ''Vom Himmel hoch'' (BWV 769) the Trio Sonata in C minor (BWV 526) and the Prelude and Fugue in E flat (BWV 552) - with brilliant contrasts of registration (almost but never quite gaudy) and with a motoric swing that sometimes called to mind the Bach interpretations of Glenn Gould. Miss Koito is by no means alone in her application of a lean often non legato style to these works but her presentation of it was particularly fresh.She played the adagio of the Vivaldi arrangement with a blunt measured tread and hollow timbres; the variations brought singing fluency and deft ornamentation. The big final piece began with majestic pacing but in a way that remained relatively brisk and bright; the fugue was begun in severe colors that gave way to a sort of crescendo of registrational variety.Interspersed with the Bach were three new pieces all of them announced as New York premieres. Henri Pousseur's ''Deuxieme Vue sur les Jardins Interdits'' explored contrasts of timbre and confrontations of dissonance with pastiche consonance; it seemed limited by a stop-and-go character. Episodic construction though did not undermine the charm of Eric Gaudibert's ''Jetees'' a partly aleatory work of great variety; my favorite section was one in which pretty tweety high beepings cavorted with an Alberich-like bassoon stop below. Giacinto Scelsi's ''In Nomine Lucis'' built wild-sounding tone clusters into a vague chaotic climax and dwindled; it sounded primitive but stirring.

 2578,  2004, a, Marines withdrew Friday from most of the positions they had taken during the three-week siege of this city as the American military began handing over control of security here to an Iraqi general under Saddam Hussein and up to 1100 men under his command.Marines abandoned buildings and bulldozed earthworks in southern and western neighborhoods of the city as the former major general Jasim Muhammad Saleh rolled into town wearing his old uniform with its crossed swords and eagle on the epaulets. Hundreds of residents cheered him along the streets some waving the old Iraqi flag.In a country where tribal loyalties are by far the most powerful allegiance it is unclear whether support of the occupation forces or national interests can supersede those or whether the Iraqi force will be willing or able to fight the insurgents.Gen. John P. Abizaid the commander of American forces in the Middle East cautioned in a teleconference from Qatar that the entry of the Iraqi soldiers would not necessarily quell the insurgency anytime soon. ''I think that we should be very careful in thinking that this effort to build this Iraqi capacity will necessarily calm down the situation in Falluja tonight or over the next several days'' he said. ''It's a step-by-step effort that will have to include a clear understanding of the security situation.''[Page A6.]

 2651,  2004, a, On our way to a screening of "Shark Tale" my daughter and I fell into a discussion of "Finding Nemo" a movie she has seen several dozen times. The subject came up naturally enough since the movie we were about to see which opens nationwide today is DreamWorks's attempt to follow Disney and Pixar into the lucrative and technologically demanding world of underwater computer-generated 3-D animation. In anticipation of the novel delights of "Shark Tale" my daughter was happy to revise her earlier high opinion of "Nemo." "It's about a fish who gets lost" she said with a shrug. "That's not really very interesting."As if on guard against such jadedness the makers of "Shark Tale" have ensured that their movie is about as many things as possible including a fish who gets lost though not quite in the way that Nemo did. The busy story in any case with its predictable messages -- Be who you are! Don't forget where you came from! Fish are friends not food! -- is secondary to the packaging a bright hectic swirl of easy jokes and accessible pop-culture allusions.There are cheerful quasi-ethnic stereotypes -- jellyfish Rastafarians shark Mafiosi aquatic ghetto kids with cans of spray paint -- that are technically insulated against offensiveness because well they're all fish. There are movie-star voices galore -- Robert De Niro Will Smith Renée Zellweger Jack Black Angelina Jolie -- and even more unusually a recognizable movie-director voice and caricature. I'm relieved (and maybe just a tiny bit disappointed) to report that when Sykes a fast-talking blowfish with bushy eyebrows appeared on screen my daughter who is 5 did not lean over and whisper "Hey isn't that Martin Scorsese?"But of course Mr. Scorsese was not there for her benefit. Like the "Shrek" pictures also from DreamWorks "Shark Tale" lobs a barrage of movie and television references over the heads of the children in the audience and into the faces of their parents. Some of these are visual like Sykes's resemblance to the auteur reading his lines while others pop up on the soundtrack which quotes the scores from "The Godfather" "Car Wash" and of course "Jaws." For the finale fishy likenesses of Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott strut and prance while the real-life divas sing us through the closing credits.

 2763,  2003, a, IN the first five months of this year companies with speculative credit ratings issued a huge amount of debt. But lately it has become harder to find enthusiastic buyers of their junk bonds.Through May the volume of new high-yield or junk bonds was up 53 percent compared with the corresponding period of 2002 according to Thomson Financial. And May has been one of the busiest months ever with $17.8 billion of such bonds sold.Seeking yields higher than the meager rates offered on safer bonds investors piled into junk-bond mutual funds. But recent data suggests that redemptions from such funds are rising.Bruce H. Monrad the chairman of Northeast Investors Trust in Boston with $1.8 billion under management most of it in high-yield bonds talked last week about the junk-bond market. Following are excerpts from the conversation:Q. According to Moody's Investors Service the default rate on corporate bonds stood at 5.8 percent for the 12 months ended April 30. That's down from 11.5 percent for the year ended Jan. 1 2002. Are fundamental conditions positive for high-yield bonds?
 3053,  2001, a, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is an astonishing work. But it's easy to forget that since so many performances are overlaid with political symbolism. For generations Beethoven's Ninth has been conscripted into service by conductors eager to make grand statements of affirmation: for United Nations Day to commemorate the Allied victory or to celebrate the tearing down of the Berlin Wall or such.But Kurt Masur has an infectious belief in the meaning of such gestures and in the message of this choral symphony with its unabashed call for brotherhood and joy. He also just happens to know a lot about conducting Beethoven. So for the last two years the New York Philharmonic's New Year's Eve performances of Beethoven's Ninth drew packed houses to Avery Fisher Hall.The hall was sold out again for this New Year's Eve concert but since the orchestra never plays on Sundays the performance took place on Saturday. The blizzard that hit the region just added to the sense of occasion. Naturally many patrons called in to return their tickets. But plenty of determined Beethoven lovers showed up before the concert to take their places.It felt good to be part of this hardy audience. If only the Philharmonic could attract this many young people to its subscription concerts. And Mr. Masur assembled a wonderfully diverse roster of performers.

 3475,  1999, a, Hordes of creatures living in the hidden depths of the deep sea are in danger of starving to death scientists report. This remote part of the planet is believed to harbor millions of undiscovered species an unknown number of which may be in crisis.A study of food supply and demand miles down in the North Pacific between 1989 and 1996 found that creatures of the seabed suffered from growing food shortages. A likely culprit scientists say is a documented increase in sea surface temperatures during the same period.''If the food deficit continues it is going to change the configuration of the deep-sea communities'' said Kenneth L. Smith Jr. a biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego and a co-author of the report which was published recently in Science. ''Some species will die out while those that can survive on a very low food supply will still be able to maintain themselves.''Little is known about the creatures of the darkness much less about fluctuations in their diets and fortunes.

 3259,  2000, a, Carl T. Hayden the chancellor of the Board of Regents and Richard P. Mills the state education commissioner said that they would not consider postponing the policy because it was already proving a success. Mr. Mills said that easing the graduation requirements even temporarily would be ''absurd'' and ''unjust'' because it would send a signal that not every student should be held to high expectations.''It is a bogus argument to suggest that some students can't achieve at the levels we have set'' Mr. Mills said. ''And it is an absurd proposal to stop at the very moment when teachers school administrators and above all children are demonstrating success.''Mr. Hayden said he was surprised at the former regents' opposition to the new graduation policy because Ms. Gluck and Ms. Matteoni participated in the discussions leading up to its adoption and voted for the requirements in 1996.But the women said that when they voted to require all students to take the Regents exams they did not realize that test scores would be the only factor determining whether students got diplomas.''The thinking at that point was that everyone would take the exams but you could get a diploma through other channels'' Ms. Gluck said. ''There was never the sense that everyone would be expected to reach the exact same goals in the exact same way.''Under the old system students had two options: getting a local diploma by passing a set of basic competency tests or getting a more prestigious Regents diploma by passing the more difficult Regents exams. When the Board of Regents adopted the new policy in 1996 less than 40 percent of students statewide -- and less than 25 percent of New York City students -- were graduating with Regents diplomas.Ms. Gluck and Ms. Matteoni said that while they had supported phasing out the basic competency tests it was with the understanding that the Regents would come up with other ways of meeting graduation requirements. Students who aspire to become chefs or mechanics should not necessarily be held to the same standard as students who want to attend Ivy League colleges they said.

 4539,  1993, a, Keely Garfield Dia Center for the ArtsIf laughter is the best medicine Keely Garfield ought to bottle herself her performers and her dances as an over-the-counter cure for innumerable ills. The two new works she presented with her well-named Sinister Slapstick company on Friday were wicked witty and full of prickly dance intelligence.Both pieces could be loosely described as deconstructions though Ms. Garfield blessedly makes no reference to the dread d-word. "One Hit Wonders" is a suite of five short pieces set to popular music whose lyrics are seen in a decidedly new way once Ms. Garfield is finished with them. Two of the three premieres in the suite also turn familiar dance genres on their heads."Precious Moments" ("A morning grope for the intimacy of the night before") set to a rendition of the song by the Three Degrees is a duet for male lovers in bathrobes and scuba flippers who find that the waning thrill of it all is more than a matter of their ridiculous footgear. There are no soulful allusions here to love that dares not speak its name in a wryly funny performance by John Maynard and Eric Diamond.In "Shirt Tales" ("Femmes amok in the laundry room of life") five women in outsized brassieres and other odd bits of white underwear white shirts hanging from their arms come dangerously close to a parody of Alvin Ailey's "Cry" and other dances dedicated to long-suffering women. Set to music by Candi Staton the piece was performed by Denise Griffin Diana Hilgert Eun-Gyu Lee Rachel Lynch-John and Kathryn Tufano.

 1475,  2010, a, Timothy Noah left of Slate and Byron York of The Washington Examiner debate why Democrats are still pursuing health care reform.
 5419,  1987, a, Between them Rainer Crone and Elizabeth Ferrer of the Columbia faculty persuaded Professor Schapiro to let them show 65 of his paintings and drawings in the Wallach Gallery. Even if we know that his first teacher was John Sloan there is something remarkable about the forthrightness of the self-portrait drawing that he made when he was 16. As for the two portrait drawings of Whittaker Chambers whom he knew well in 1923 they have a bite and a grip that are astonishing for someone who was barely 19 at the time.Meyer Schapiro has always been around artists and from Max Weber and Stuart Davis to Barnett Newman Donald Judd and R. B. Kitaj they have prized his company. When with them he had a rare gift for the unexpected push in the right direction. We know from the late Thomas B. Hess whose essay of 1978 is reprinted in the catalogue that as an exile in New York during World War II Fernand Leger was delighted to be introduced by Professor Schapiro to the ''Beatus Apocalypse'' in the Morgan Library with its ''background shapes of intense color bounded by crisp edges'' that Leger soon adapted to his own uses. And it was he in 1952 who was able to persuade Willem de Kooning that ''Woman I'' was not a failure as de Kooning had supposed but a success from which other successes were sure to come.Given a record of this kind and given the diffidence with which Professor Schapiro regards his own activity as an artist it should surprise no one that the works in his show -most of them small - are gentle and ruminative in character and touch on a whole gamut of idioms. (There is even a study after a drawing by Seurat that would deceive many a layman. Matisse is there too in a drawing of Mrs. Schapiro done in 1932.) There are landscape studies (note the tall clouded sky in ''Glebe Mountain'') and cityscapes (note the deft placement and the beauty of tone in ''Riverside Park New York Near the West 80's''). Family subjects play a large part in the show and often bring out a freedom of color and a lightness of touch that speak for the pleasure with which they were done. And as Professor Schapiro has always been hypersensitive to political developments it is natural that before and during World War II there are imaginative subjects (''Furious Monsters'' for one and ''Apocalypse Over Manhattan'' for another not to mention ''War'' and ''War and Peace'') that touch on the terrors of the day.There are some very good later portraits and there are abstractions that have both weight and resolution. But then nothing that comes from Meyer Schapiro's hand - whether written drawn or painted - can leave us indifferent. The show is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 1 to 5 P.M. through May 23 and it is best reached from the university entrance at Broadway and 116th Street. Jean Dubuffet Wildenstein & Company 19 East 64th Street Through May 29 Pace Gallery 42 West 57th Street Through May 30From the moment in 1946 when his work was first presented by the Pierre Matisse Gallery New York has never been short of Dubuffet exhibitions. Readers may wonder therefore why we should need yet another large retrospective - spread this time over two galleries with the earlier work at Wildenstein's and the later work at the Pace Gallery. Shouldn't he be given a rest? How many more of those relentless jigsaws do we have to decipher?

 5796,  1985, a, Brock Adams who became Secretary of Transportation after six terms in the House of Representatives is planning to run for the Senate next year from his home state of Washington. A Democrat he intends to challenge the re-election bid of Senator Slade Gorton a Republican who won 54 percent of the vote in 1980 on a ticket headed by Ronald Reagan thereby retiring the Democratic veteran Warren G. Magnuson.Friends of Mr. Adams predict he would have ''an uphill race'' against the incumbent if he is nominated. As for winning the Democratic nomination party leaders say Representative Mike Lowry of Seattle is consid-ering entering the primary but otherwise appears to be the only other aspirant. The other four Democrats in the Washington House delegation are reportedly backing the former Cabinet officer and national party officials have promised him financial and organizational assistance in the general election.Mr. Adams served in the House from 1965 through 1976 and was the first chairman of the House Budget Committee. President Carter named him Secretary of Transportation in late 1976 and he served until mid-1979. Since then he has practiced law in the Washington office of Garvey Schubert Adams & Barer a Seattle firm. He has made no secret of Senate ambitions but he was effectively blocked for many years by the formidable Democratic team of Senators Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson.
 4989,  1990, a, Three Million MailingsRoger Craver a direct-mail consultant with half a dozen clients who have questioned the Souter nomination said he had already sent out three million mailings to alert people about a possible fight over abortion. He said he was preparing a second series of mailings aimed at the Judiciary Committee and the Senate ''to impress upon the Senate that they must ask this question'' about the judge's stand on abortion.One letter sent by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund sought an ''emergency contribution'' with this statement: ''You can count on my help in launching the Fund for Justice to make certain that Judge Souter will be the kind of Supreme Court Justice who recognizes and protects our right to privacy and reproductive rights.''Another an ''express wire'' from the National Organization for Women declared: ''Judge Souter must be subjected to the same level of scrutiny to which Robert Bork was subjected in 1987. We expect no less this time from the Senate Judiciary Committee.'''Collecting Data' on SouterGroups that oppose abortion have not been as quick to produce mailings even though organizations on both sides of the issue found that the longer the debate simmered the more money they collected when Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination was before the Senate in 1987.The direct-mail company of Richard A. Delgaudio which produced solicitations in the Bork battle has not yet used Judge Souter for fund raising. ''Organizations don't know as much about Souter'' said George Lodick a company official. ''They're in the process of collecting data. So we haven't decided anything.''
 3907,  1997, a, Citizens Against a Constitutional Convention which includes unions environmentalists trial lawyers and abortion rights advocates has begun running 30-second television commercials around the state.PRODUCER -- Joe Slade White & Co.ON THE SCREEN -- Two balding overweight men one holding a cigar the other fondling a wine cooler smirk. As the narrator speaks they pop open a champagne bottle and sip while confetti rains down. The spot ends with white words on a black background: ''Tuesday Nov. 4 Vote No on the Constitutional Convention.''THE SCRIPT -- ''The same old insiders the bigwigs and the billionaires want to rewrite New York's Constitution. Is that a good idea? And they expect New York taxpayers to pay $50 million for their constitutional convention. Fifty million tax dollars? Your taxes their party. It's time to tell the bigwigs and the billionaires that the party is over. On Tuesday Nov. 4 send them a message. Vote no on their constitutional convention.''ACCURACY -- The only billionaire clearly in favor of the convention is Ronald Lauder a champion of term limits. But he has yet to spend a dime promoting it. Change-N.Y. an anti-tax group financed by Wall Street millionaires opposes it. So it is fair to say that big money is on both sides. The cost of a convention is also unclear. Opponents put the cost at $50 million. But proponents say that delegates could pool staffs and forsake perquisites to keep the cost to $15 million.

 2305,  2006, a, Well here are the latest poll results according to Adam Nagourney and Megan Thee:A substantial majority of Americans expect Democrats to reduce or end American military involvement in Iraq if they win control of Congress next Tuesday and say Republicans would maintain or increase troop levels to try to win the war if they hold on to power on Capitol Hill according to the final New York Times/CBS News poll before the midterm election.The poll found that just 29 percent of Americans approve of the way President Bush is managing the war in Iraq matching the lowest mark of his presidency. Nearly 70 percent of Americans said Mr. Bush did not have a plan to end the war and an overwhelming 80 percent said Mr. Bush’s latest effort to rally public support for the conflict amounted to a change in language but not policy.The poll underlined the extent to which the war has framed the midterm elections. Americans cited Iraq as the most important issue affecting their vote and majorities of Republicans and Democrats said they wanted a change in the government’s approach to the war. Only 20 percent said they thought the United States was winning in Iraq down from a high of 36 percent in January.

 3061,  2001, a, EXACTLY 125 years ago next month Alexander Graham Bell said into the very first telephone ''Mr. Watson come here I want to see you.'' Nobody remembers what the inventor of the first cordless phone said but it was probably ''Hey has anyone seen the handset?''There's no disputing that cordless phones offer a degree of freedom lacking in curly-cord phones; for one thing a cordless phone ends the noisy humiliation of dragging your telephone off the desk while reaching for a pencil. Unfortunately when a cordless conversation ends so does the freedom -- sooner or later you must return the phone to its base station which is tethered to a phone jack. As a result typical cordless phones are really only slightly less tied down than corded ones.But a new era of phone freedom has dawned thanks to a new breed of phone: the multihandset cordless. These systems let you park the base station anywhere in your home or small office even someplace inaccessible. Then you can strategically position as many cordless handsets as you need -- up to eight or nine -- all over the premises. The tiny recharging stand that comes with each handset requires a power outlet but no phone line freeing you to stash phones into oddball corners that aren't anywhere near phone jacks.That freedom of placement however is only the first joy of multihandset phones; another huge advantage is their corporate-style communications features. For example you can make intercom-style calls from handset to handset without tying up the phone line. You can transfer a call you've just answered to the base or to another handset without having to cover the mouthpiece and yell ''It's for you!'' And most let you check for messages on the base station's answering machine from any handset in the house conserving precious muscle energy.

 4152,  1995, a, To the Editor:Re "Russia Unchains a Ghost: Stalin the Wartime Hero" (Week in Review April 23):It is astonishing to read of the efforts being made in Russia to rehabilitate Stalin as Soviet leader in World War II in view of the extent to which his cynical bungling policies contributed to the wartime suffering of the Soviet people.Britain and France went to war in defense of Poland in 1939 when the Soviet Union was allied with Nazi Germany. Stalin was scrupulously loyal to his Nazi ally shipping large quantities of raw materials and foodstuffs to Germany and even going so far as to deliver up scores of German Communist exiles to certain death at the hands of the Nazis.American Communists were instructed to oppose aid to Britain and Communists in the French Army during the "Phony War" of 1939-40 did everything possible to undermine morale.Assuming that Hitler's good faith would match his own Stalin was caught completely by surprise when the Germans attacked in June 1941. The Red Army simply collapsed along the entire front suffering millions of casualties. Stalin dropped from sight for several weeks and is generally believed to have had a nervous collapse.

 1231,  2012, a, Last Updated | Tuesday 7:12 a.m. As my colleague David Kirkpatrick reports video posted on YouTube five days ago apparently showing a missing American journalist in the hands of jihadist captors in Syria may have been staged to discredit the armed opposition to the Syrian government according to several analysts who viewed the clip on Monday.The reporter Austin Tice left the United States Marine Corps last year and has been contributing freelance articles to two American newspaper companies McClatchy and The Washington Post and other outlets since he smuggled himself into Syria from Turkey in May. He last communicated with colleagues by e-mail on Aug. 13. An update he posted on Twitter two days earlier about enjoying an alcohol-fueled birthday party with members of the Free Syrian Army underscored that he was on good terms with the rebels he was reporting on at the time.Spent the day at an FSA pool party with music by @taylorswift13. They even brought me whiskey. Hands down best birthday ever. — Austin Tice (@Austin_Tice) 11 Aug 12A State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at a briefing on Monday: “We’ve seen the video. We are not in a position to verify (a) whether it’s him (b) whether it represents an actual scene that happened or something that may have been staged.” She added: ” There’s a lot of reason for the Syrian Government to duck responsibility but we continue to believe that to the best of our knowledge we think he is in Syrian Government custody.”Mr Tice’s parents Marc and Debra Tice confirmed that the man in the video was their son in a statement that began: “Knowing Austin is alive and well is comforting to our family. Though it is difficult to see our eldest son in such a setting and situation as that depicted in the video it is reassuring that he appears to be unharmed.”As the McClatchy correspondent Hannah Allam explains the brief video clip showing the reporter alive was uploaded to a new YouTube account last Wednesday but seen much more widely on Monday after it was posted on Facebook by supporters of President Bashar al-Assad. James Ball of The Washington Post reports that the pro-Assad blogger who drew attention to the video on Facebook wrote that the images of the reporter being held by Islamists rather than government forces proved that “Western media is working against Syria.”Analysts contacted by both McClatchy and The Post and bloggers who have worked to authenticate video from Syria for the past 18 months agreed that some details of the video did not ring true.The clip shows the American captive wearing a blindfold clearly distressed as he tries to recite an Islamic prayer in Arabic to armed captors before breaking off and exclaiming in English: “Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.” Close observers of video from Syria and of jihadist clips drew attention to the unusual clothes worn by Mr. Tice’s captors and the halting way they shouted expressions of praise for Allah as if they needed to be prompted.Joseph Holliday a former United States Army intelligence officer who tracks Syrian rebel groups for the Institute for the Study of War in Washington told The Post that it seemed strange that the armed men around Mr. Tice were wearing what appear to be salwar kameez traditional clothing worn in Afghanistan which looked very clean. “It’s like a caricature of a jihadi group” he said. “My gut instinct is that regime security guys dressed up like a bunch of wahoos and dragged him around and released the video to scare the U.S. and others about the danger of Al Qaeda extremists in Syria. It would fit their narrative perfectly.”The video came to light the same day that Syria’s foreign minister Walid al-Moallem scolded other countries who “clearly induce and support terrorism in Syria with money weapons and foreign fighters” in an address to the United Nations General Assembly.In an interview with McClatchy Murad Batal al Shishani an analyst in London who monitors extremist groups cast doubt on a comment on the pro-Assad Facebook page which said that “the American journalist Austin Tice is with the Nusra Front gangs and Al Qaeda in Syria” an apparent reference to Jabhat al-Nusra a jihadist group. But as Ms. Allam writes that organization has “a sophisticated media wing that produces a Twitter feed and videos that are clearly labeled and edited.” It would be unusual for the group to have simply uploaded the clip to YouTube and waited for pro-Assad bloggers to draw attention to it rather than using well-known jihadist Internet forums.Jenan Moussa a reporter for Al Aan TV in Dubai who has worked in Syria recently wrote on Twitter that none of the fighters from that group she saw there wore Afghan-style clothing.Jabhat AlNusra fighters I saw w/ @HaraldDoornbos in #Syria had military fatigue. Few fighters had long Dashdasha not afghan Shalwar Kameez. — Jenan Moussa (@jenanmoussa) 1 Oct 12A Syrian activist who writes on Twitter as @THE_47th posted a link to another Web video with a logo titles music and flashy editing noting “This is what a Jabhat Al Nusra capture video looks like it is of 5 Yemeni Officers captured in Syria thought to be helping the regime.”In an interview with Matt Weaver the Guardian’s Middle East live-blogger on Tuesday a friend who helped Mr. Tice enter Syria said the journalist had tried to interview a Jabhat Al Nusra commander but the group then cancelled a scheduled meeting.Mr. Tice’s friend Michael Weiss is the research director of the conservative Henry Jackson Society a foreign policy institute in London. He also told The Guardian: “The last time I spoke to Austin was on G-chat August 8th and he was in an area of Damascus that was subsequently pummeled by the regime and then raided.”After viewing the video Mr. Tice’s family in Texas and senior editors at McClatchy and The Post called for his immediate release.As he reported from Syria this year Mr. Tice used social networks to stay in touch with his family to publish his work and even to argue about coverage of the conflict with colleagues.Darraya residents clean a town street. Most gov services have been cut to this suburb on the west side of Damascus. //t.co/k5SVamaF — Austin Tice (@Austin_Tice) 7 Aug 12In a series of Twitter updates the week before he disappeared Mr. Tice criticized a post on The Lede drawing attention to a spate of new reports from Western journalists who made it into rebel-held territory in August. “The way has always been open. This whole spin is an excuse for laziness” he wrote. “Clearly the risk is real” he added: “But idea that it’s prohibitive of more/better coverage is a red herring. I see it as corporate overlawyering.”.@RobertMackey @thelede @hadeelalsh @javierespinosa2 @martinchulov The way has always been open. This whole spin is an excuse for laziness. — Austin Tice (@Austin_Tice) 7 Aug 12Just weeks before he went missing the former soldier wrote a manifesto of sorts on Facebook explaining his decision to work in such a risky environment to family and friends which was reproduced in its entirety by The Post in August. The message began:It’s nice and all but please quit telling me to be safe. Against my better judgment I’m posting this on Facebook. Flame away. People keep telling me to be safe (as if that’s an option) keep asking me why I’m doing this crazy thing keep asking what’s wrong with me for coming here. So listen. Our granddads stormed Normandy and Iwo Jima and defeated global fascism. Neil Armstrong flew to the Moon in a glorified trashcan doing math on a clipboard as he went. Before there were roads the Pioneers put one foot in front of the other until they walked across the entire continent. Then a bunch of them went down to fight and die in Texas ‘cause they thought it was the right thing to do. Sometime between when our granddads licked the Nazis and when we started putting warnings on our coffee cups about the temperature of our beverage America lost that pioneering spirit. We became a fat weak complacent coddled unambitious and cowardly nation. I went off to two wars with misguided notions of patriotism and found in both that the first priority was to never get killed something we could have achieved from our living rooms in America with a lot less hassle. To protect careers and please the politicians we weighed ourselves down with enough armor to break a man’s back gorged on RipIts and ice cream and believed our own press that we were doing something noble.He contrasted American life to the current struggle in Syria where “every person in this country fighting for their freedom wakes up every day and goes to sleep every night with the knowledge that death could visit them at any moment.”He concluded:

 1178,  2012, a, DETROIT — Joe Torre managed Russell Martin for three seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers. But his phone call to Martin the Yankees’ catcher on Thursday was not to say hello or ask about his Carolina blue sneakers.As major league baseball’s executive vice president for baseball operations Torre is responsible for discipline and umpiring. Torre wanted to hear Martin’s version of the snit with the plate umpire Laz Diaz on Wednesday night in Anaheim when Martin questioned some pitches and Diaz declined to hand him new baseballs to throw back to the pitcher. Martin claimed Diaz told him he had to earn the privilege.Martin said he returned Torre’s call Friday before the Yankees faced the Tigers at soggy Comerica Park. Torre had already spoken to Diaz Martin said.“He wanted to hear both sides of the story” Martin said. “It’s not a major issue. It’s more childish than anything else.”Yankees Manager Joe Girardi a former catcher said Friday he had never heard of an umpire penalizing a catcher in that way. “I’m glad it’s over with just kind of let the league handle it” Girardi said. “I know Russell was frustrated by it. Let it die and we’ll move on and the league will handle it the way they’re going to handle it.”Martin likes to toss new balls to the mound to keep his arm loose especially with men on base. Girardi understood why Martin made an issue of it. “It’s a guy’s personal preference” he said. “As athletes very seldom are we going to back down either.”It is not clear whether Torre might discipline Diaz for his actions or Martin for speaking out. Martin brought up the conflict with reporters after the game without being asked about it. He used an expletive in referring to Diaz and his comments included “I know he can hold a grudge with the best of them.”Friday Girardi brushed off questions about possible reprisals by Diaz or other umpires.“We may not see him for three months” Girardi said. “I’m not concerned. And I’m sure baseball will watch and he understands that too.”Said Martin: “I just hope to get to throw the ball back to pitcher next time. I don’t think it’s going to be an issue unless you guys write about it every day.”Young Returns to New York The last time the Yankees and the Tigers met in late April at Yankee Stadium Delmon Young spent the entire series on the restricted list after being arrested in the early morning April 27. Young was charged with aggravated harassment a misdemeanor after an altercation with four men outside the New York Hilton Hotel in midtown.The Tigers had flown in from Detroit the night of the 26th after a day game at Comerica Park. The police said an apparently intoxicated Young yelled an anti-Semitic remark and tackled one of the men. The Tigers put Young on the restricted list the next day. He later drew a seven-day suspension without pay from Major League Baseball and apologized for his conduct.Young returned to New York last Tuesday morning for a brief hearing then rejoined the Tigers in Boston and went 1-for-4 that night in a 6-3 loss to the Red Sox. He is due back in court on Aug. 2.Since the suspension Young has hit .265 (26 for 98) with 3 homers and 14 runs batted in raising his season average to .256 from 242 heading into Friday. All the home runs have come since May 18. Young was in Detroit’s starting lineup Friday night batting fifth.Robertson to Throw Off Mound David Robertson (strained left oblique) will throw off a bullpen mound for the first time Saturday or Sunday in Tampa Girardi said a key step in Robertson’s recovery from a strained left oblique. Girardi said Robertson was supposed to play catch Thursday but could not because of rain.Girardi said Brett Gardner (strained right elbow) took batting practice in the covered cages in Tampa.Neither player is close to returning to the active roster.Anniversary for Jeter Friday marked the 20th anniversary of the Yankees drafting Derek Jeter out of Kalamazoo Central High School as the sixth overall pick. “Twenty years goes way too fast is probably what comes to mind the most” Girardi said with a laugh. The five players chosen ahead of Jeter: third baseman Phil Nevin (Houston) pitcher Paul Shuey (Cleveland) pitcher B.J. Wallace (Montreal) outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds (Baltimore) and outfielder Chad Mottola (Cincinnati).

 1434,  2011, a, Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.In addition to the domestic challenge it presented the fledgling Confederacy posed a foreign policy dilemma for Abraham Lincoln’s administration. The Confederacy hoped to use its position as a crucial source of cotton to secure recognition from foreign powers and boost its legitimacy and it sent commissioners abroad to sway other countries into supporting its cause.In response Secretary of State William Seward threatened war against European countries who interfered in America’s domestic conflict. But the administration wasn’t the only branch to enter the foreign-policy fray: In July 1861 Representative Samuel Sullivan Cox a Democrat from Ohio submitted a resolution calling on Lincoln to share with the House “all correspondence with the English French Spanish and other Governments with reference to the right of blockade privateering and the recognition of the so-called confederate States.” It passed with bipartisan ease as did two more similar resolutions submitted during the following weeks.Lincoln hardly welcomed such extensive oversight; on July 25 the same day that Representative Timothy Howe a Republican from Wisconsin submitted the third of the resolutions the president sent word to the House that the “correspondence called for” would not be forthcoming at that time. The reason for the delay is unclear: of the three resolutions Cox’s mentioned that the correspondence could be submitted “at the beginning of the next session of Congress” and the administration appears to have taken that as an opportunity to wait as long as feasible to release the documents.Eventually however Lincoln complied. In doing so he not only provided his contemporaries and future Americans with an almost real-time detailed look into the daily operations of the country’s foreign policy apparatus in crisis but he set a precedent for State Department transparency that is still followed today.Because the resolutions passed with little or no discussion we have little direct evidence for what Congress was thinking at the time. But we can infer a few things from the broader context. For one such requests were hardly unprecedented: throughout the early republic the legislature had asked for (and the executive branch had supplied) diplomatic instructions and dispatches related to treaties boundary disputes and other foreign affairs. And of course the war made foreign policy an especially touchy subject; by examining the correspondence Congress surely hoped to see that Seward was instructing ministers to appropriately defend American interests and that the ministers were faithfully carrying out the instructions.After months of delay Lincoln finally complied with the resolutions. On Dec. 3 1861 as the second session of the 37th Congress got underway Lincoln sent a message to both houses of Congress. The “message” portion of this communication was quite brief but attached to it was correspondence between the United States and its ministers abroad bound together in one volume (you can read the volume here).Lincoln’s missive opened with a short discussion of foreign relations before turning to other domestic matters. He characterized the Confederate effort to gain recognition from foreign governments as sputtering and unsuccessful noting “the disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected.” After dismissing Confederate diplomatic efforts Lincoln announced that he had submitted the requested correspondence and he hoped that those who read it would see that his administration had “practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign powers averting causes of irritation; and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor.”There followed 425 pages of correspondence between the government and its diplomatic ministers abroad (the United States would not have proper “ambassadors” until 1893). After printing a series of general circulars the volume reproduced material regarding 24 countries: not only the major European powers but most of Latin America and even Egypt the Hawaiian Islands and Japan.The material wasn’t for Congress alone; the White House released it to the public as well. For those who could not get their hands on the volume itself copies of its contents traveled quickly up and down the coast published in newspapers.By perusing the documents Americans could see how the Union defended its interests in countries large and small near and far. Obviously staving off Confederate agents was a key task for America’s ministers. Seward wrote to Carl Schurz the minister to Spain that preventing the Confederacy from gaining recognition was “your chief duty and no more important one was ever devolved by the United States upon any representative whom they have sent abroad.”Even in countries of lesser importance ministers were urged to be on the watch. Although Seward did not believe that the Confederates would attempt to gain recognition immediately from Denmark he wrote to his representative there that “political action even of the more commanding or more active States is influenced by a general opinion that is formed imperceptibly in all parts of the Eastern continent. Every representative of the United States in Europe has therefore a responsibility to see that no effort on his part is wanting to make that opinion just so far as the true position of affairs is in his own country is concerned.”Representatives abroad had an important public relations role to play particularly when news traveled slowly across the Atlantic Ocean and rumors were rife. Seward’s instructions encouraged ministers to not let discouraging news from America cloud foreigners’ perceptions of the war effort. After the First Battle of Bull Run in a letter marked “confidential” he wrote to Charles Francis Adams the minister in London that “you will hear of a reverse of our arms in Virginia” and encouraged him to think little of it. “The vigor of the government will be increased and the ultimate result will be a triumph of the Constitution” Seward wrote. “Do not be misled by panic reports of danger apprehended for the capital.” Seward likewise wrote to William Lewis Dayton in France that “treason was emboldened by its partial success at Manassas but the Union now grows manifestly stronger every day.” Foreigners could get their news from any number of sources and ministers had to stand ready to put a positive spin on events.The volume also exposed domestic readers to the administration’s frustration with the willingness of the British to treat the Confederates as belligerents. This step granted the Confederates some credibility even if it fell short of the full recognition they desired. In these documents Northern readers could see unbiased proof that this action did not go without protest. Adams proclaimed to the British that the Americans were “irritated” by the British treatment of Confederates as belligerents.Slavery is mentioned throughout the volume although at this point in the war the rhetoric was more about the dangers of the political power of Southern slaveholders than the virtues of emancipation. Slavery certainly got credit for causing the war. Seward wrote to Dayton in France that “the attempted revolution is simply causeless. It is indeed equally without a reason and without an object unless it be one arising out of the subject of slavery.” Seward instructed the representative in Russia that although slavery had existed in all the states at the time of the American Revolution “it was expected that under the operation of moral social and political influences then existing the practice of slavery would soon cease.” The “cause” of the rebellion was the fact that the slave states having suffered defeat at the polls in 1860 “took an appeal from the verdict of the people rendered through the ballot-box to the sword and organized a revolution with civil war.”Related Disunion Highlights Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. See the Highlights »The decision to release the material won glowing reviews. The Baltimore Sun reported on Dec. 9 that the correspondence was “receiving that close attention from persons skilled in diplomacy and public law which belongs to its distinguished source and the magnitude of the subject in question.” The Keene New Hampshire Sentinel reported that “in the whole of this correspondence the Secretary of State exhibits marked ability as a statesman and diplomatist.”By January 1862 the correspondence had reached the West Coast; the San Francisco Bulletin reported that the diplomatic correspondence was “quite voluminous” and “highly interesting.” Seward again came in for praise; his “high-toned” and “courteous” messages were “as nearly perfect models of diplomatic correspondence as are to be found on the pages of modern history.” The correspondence with Adams and Dayton “have swept to the winds all the aspersions of those who have accused him of favoring a timid and wavering policy in dealing with the rebels.” The volume attracted attention from abroad as well; shortly after its release Lord Richard Lyons British minister to the United States sent a copy to Lord John Russell the British foreign minister.What can we learn from this volume of foreign affairs documentation released as the first year of the war drew to a close? First it represents what the Lincoln administration wanted the American public to know about foreign affairs (as distinct from telling us in the modern day everything we might like to know about diplomacy during the Civil War). Judging by the newspaper response Americans were pleased with how the federal government was acting. Publishing the documentation also exposed British and French actions toward the Confederates which helped Americans direct their ire toward those two countries.Second the publication of the volume demonstrates the balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches during the mid-19th century: although the executive branch bore responsibility for foreign policy the legislative branch could wield significant power by demanding to see copies of the documentation.Perhaps most importantly the volume illustrates an early attempt at government openness — and given the exigencies of wartime a surprisingly forthright one. The summer resolutions requesting the documents made an allowance for Lincoln’s assessment of the “public interest” in determining which documents not to submit to Congress and we have no way of knowing what type of selection policy was in place. At the same time the resolutions make clear that Congress expected to receive something. Indeed diplomatic correspondence was released to Congress on an ad hoc basis throughout the early republic; but that it was still done in a moment of clear crisis demonstrates that Lincoln’s administration saw the value in getting the correspondence in the public’s hands.There is a final consequence which no one in 1861 could likely have foretold: The State Department continues to publish edited collections of foreign affairs documentation 150 years later. Although the Foreign Relations of the United States series does not release documents as rapidly as Lincoln did and so has become a historical look at American foreign relations rather than a contemporary publication of documents the release of the volume in 1861 set a landmark democratic precedent: that the American government must on a regular basis keep the public informed about its foreign policy operations.Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Sources: Congressional Globe; Howard Jones “Blue and Gray Diplomacy: A History of Confederate Foreign Relations”; Roy Basler ed. “Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln” Vol. IV; Message of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress at the Commencement of the Second Session of the 37th Congress.“Aaron W.

 4218,  1995, a, A FISH IN THE WATER: A Memoir By Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Helen Lane. Penguin $14.95. The author is best known as a novelist but he had a brief career as a politician. He explores both roles in this memoir which describes his formative years as well as his 1990 run for President of Peru. The campaign was a debacle but many predicted Mr. Vargas Llosa would use the experience to write "a good book" Alan Riding said here last year. "And he has." HEADING WEST By Doris Betts. Scribner Paperback $12. Nancy Finch an unmarried librarian is the kind of woman nothing happens to. That is until her vacation in North Carolina is interrupted by an armed man who kidnaps her and proceeds to drive toward the Grand Canyon. Issues of responsibility and accountability arise as Nancy realizes she has become a silent partner in her own abduction. Just restored to print this 1982 novel offers pleasures "infinitely more subtle complex and memorable than being scared in your armchair" Beth Gutcheon wrote in these pages when it was published. She added " 'Heading West' is a book of great delights." Ms. Betts's collection THE ASTRONOMER AND OTHER STORIES (Louisiana State University $11.95) is also in print again. Many kinds of innocence are lost in these pieces including in the title novella that of a retired man who has assumed he is beyond fantasy and desire. In 1966 our reviewer Benedict Kiely said the author "displays equally a rich imagination and disturbing vision." A NEW WORLD: An Epic of Colonial America From the Founding of Jamestown to the Fall of Quebec By Arthur Quinn. Berkley $15. A historian details the many ways in which early America's idealism was either squelched or nonexistent. (John Smith's character he notes was not exactly as it is portrayed in Disney's "Pocahontas.") "His book is a scrumptious reminder of the pleasures of historical writing that rises to the level of literature" George F. Will wrote in the Book Review last year. ARABIAN NIGHTS & DAYS By Naguib Mahfouz. Translated by Denys Johnson-Davies. Anchor/Doubleday $12. Many folk and fairy tales have a dark side and this Egyptian Nobel laureate finds one throughout "The Arabian Nights." (Scheherazade's marriage to a lecherous murderer was hardly a happy ending.) His retelling can be read as a "daring and biting critique of the corruption of power in the modern Middle East" one critic said earlier this year. The same publisher has reissued Mr. Mahfouz's novel THE HARAFISH translated by Catherine Cobham ($11) which depicts the fate of numerous generations of a family whose roots are in what Americans might call the underclass (and Arabs call the harafish). In 1994 one reviewer described it as "a whirling dervish of a good yarn." More Arabian tales can be found in DAMASCUS NIGHTS by Rafik Schami translated by Philip Boehm (Scribner Paperback $11). In 1959 a great Syrian storyteller struck mute by witchcraft can regain his voice only if he is given seven unique gifts -- which turn out to be stories. The author "writes with wisdom wit and lightheartedness" Malcolm Bradbury said here in 1993. TRUE NORTH: A Memoir By Jill Ker Conway. Vintage $12. The author who wrote of her childhood in the Australian outback in "The Road From Coorain" turns here to her adult challenges in a different wilderness: academia. She "has come a long way from the parched fields" she grew up in Carol Brightman wrote in these pages last year. A woman's journeys are also the basis of AN UNSPOKEN HUNGER: Stories From the Field by Terry Tempest Williams (Vintage $10). This Utah-based writer and naturalist explores her own connections to the earth and those of women like Georgia O'Keeffe and Rachel Carson. In 1994 our reviewer John Hanson Mitchell praised the book's "dark strength and power." ONE TRUE THING By Anna Quindlen. Dell $6.99. The narrator a young journalist named Ellen Gulden has to confront both the loss of her mother and the accusation that she ended her ill parent's suffering. As the novel depicts Kate Gulden's final days "the reader cannot help caring about her and mourning her death" Frederick Busch said in the Book Review last year. HENRY ADAMS By Ernest Samuels. Belknap/Harvard University $16.95. This book a revision and abridgment of the author's 1964 Pulitzer Prize-winning three-volume work shows its subject to be more appealing as a historian and writer than as a human being. "It is a complete success" and "a remarkable feat of the biographer's art" Hugh Brogan wrote in these pages in 1989. OUT OF SILENCE: An Autistic Boy's Journey Into Language and Communication By Russell Martin. Penguin $11.95. Speaking is so natural to most people that it is rarely remembered that every conversation is the result of a complex neurological process. The author writes of just how difficult it was for language to take hold in his autistic nephew's seething brain. The result is "deeply moving" F. Gonzalez-Crussi said here last year. THE TRIBE OF TIGER: Cats and Their Culture By Elizabeth Marshall Thomas. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster $12. Felines by no means all aloof or solitary are revealed in their complexity by the author of "The Hidden Life of Dogs."

 3558,  1999, a, The Diallo killing in which the officers stand charged with second-degree murder set off months of demonstrations in which the police were accused of trampling civil rights in their zeal to curb crime. Many critics said they were particularly upset by what they described as indiscriminate and routine searches in minority neighborhoods.The most basic finding of Mr. Spitzer's study was that blacks were stopped six times more often than whites. Hispanics were stopped four times more often the report said.Blacks for example made up 25 percent of the city population but 50 percent of the people stopped. Whites by comparison made up 43 percent of the population but were stopped only 13 percent of the time.Police officials have long contended that the disparity was based on the fact that most people are stopped in poor high-crime neighborhoods many of which have a majority of black and Hispanic residents. But the attorney general's analysis found that even when the statistics were adjusted to take higher crime rates among minorities into account the number of blacks and Hispanics stopped still far exceeded the number of whites stopped.Citywide the study found that after adjusting for different crime rates among racial groups Hispanics were stopped 39 percent more often than whites. Blacks were stopped 23 percent more often the study said.To arrive at those percentages the analysts compared how often members of a particular race were stopped to how often they were arrested. The analysis found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped at a rate that was much higher than the rate at which they were arrested. The rate at which whites were stopped was only slightly higher than the rate at which they were arrested.For example there were 1.5 stops of blacks for every black arrested but 1.2 stops of whites for every white arrested. Analysts calculated that blacks were stopped 23 percent more often than whites. In the category of violent crime officials said the disparity was even more stark. For example the study said blacks were stopped as suspects in violent crimes twice as often as whites even after adjusting for the difference in arrest rates between the two races.

 2963,  2002, a, The roots of today's disk-drive industry can largely be traced back to work originally done in the 1950's.While he was at I.B.M. Dr. Bajorek was a key member of the team of researchers that during the 1970's developed the basic magneto-resistive recording and sensing-head technology that is the basis of modern disk drives. For his contribution he was awarded the Reynold B. Johnson Information Storage Award by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers this year.Today a more refined version of the writing and reading heads that descended from Dr. Bajorek's research ''fly'' over the disk surface at a height of about 150 angstroms (an angstrom is roughly the width of a single hydrogen atom). The tolerances are even more remarkable given that hard disk drives are rapidly becoming a staple of consumer products like Apple Computer's iPod music players which are handled with little awareness of the delicate machine that stores digital data.The surface of the Komag disk itself is composed of nine separate layers that sit on an aluminum platter. The data itself is organized in three layers of nickel phosphorus shielded by two layers of a diamond-like carbon material. Currently the magnetic ones and zeros are aligned end-to-end in concentric tracks. By 2004 Dr. Bajorek believes the industry will need to begin stacking the tiny magnetic domains perpendicularly to squeeze them more tightly onto the surface of the disk media.Progress in disk-drive storage in recent years has been made by pushing back what the industry refers to as the ''superparamagnetic limit'' the size at which the magnetic spots are so small that their magnetic fields can no longer be kept stable at room temperature. Last year I.B.M. announced it had begun to use new materials the company referred to as ''pixie dust'' to push back the limit.In contrast Dr. Bajorek said Komag had been able to achieve the same densities without resorting to new materials. That will offer a significant cost savings in the next two generations of disk media. ''We were blessed with conventional designs that were more thermally stable'' he said.The company is less blessed in terms of competition. Although Komag is the only remaining independent supplier of disk media in the United States both I.B.M. during its transition to Hitachi and Seagate will continue to manufacture disks for their own products. And although industry executives said Komag was having some luck in pursuing both companies as customers internationally it faces three competitors in Japan and a fourth in Taiwan.

 4491,  1993, a, This Martina II with a radiant smile is lithe at 5 feet 4 inches. Manufacturers are already donating equipment to her. Keretic says she may play in the junior competition at the United States Open in August which would be her first trip ever to the United States. And she can play.The young player who is right-handed with a two-handed backhand was introduced to grass last Thursday by her mother who is also her coach. Today Hingis beat Tzu-Ting Weng of Taipei 7-5 6-3 after her rather undeveloped service was broken three times in the first set. Hingis beat the larger player a day short of her 15th birthday with lobs and drops but also with strong forehands and a growing comfort in going to the net."It's much better how she wins the matches" said Keretic a former West German Davis Cup and tour player based in Hamburg. "Normally the all-round player takes longer to develop. She plays everything. She can stay back and she can force the pace." Doesn't Mind Back CourtsDuring a short interview translated by Eva Keretic the New York-born wife of the manager Hingis said she liked playing on grass at the back courts of Wimbledon."I've played in front of large crowds but here the people are interested in Agassi and Sampras and the others" said Hingis who actually has drawn large crowds of curious fans.The young player will soon return to the small village of Trubbach where her mother is married to a Swiss businessman. Mother and daughter left Czechoslovakia four years ago. Hingis is said to be an A student and likes horseback riding and swimming.Most people who interview her voice concern that her childhood will be cut short by the pro tour."At 14 I will decide whether to turn pro" she said. "I will travel more then. It won't be the same but we are determined to be home as much as possible."

 3932,  1996, a, "A form of complacency we seem to be looking at here is a crew's loss of the big picture sometimes called situation awareness" said C. O. Miller an internationally respected safety consultant. "Loss of awareness is too often compounded by excessive dependence on these automated systems especially when there is only a short time to act."Here is how the airliner would normally have been operated on its trip and what initial analysis of flight-recorder data indicates led to the disaster:Before takeoff from Miami the flight management computer was programmed to guide the plane on a standard route taking it past a succession of radio-navigation stations or fixes on the ground. The computer system would automatically tune in successive stations. The plane's automatic pilot would steer the plane either directly over stations or off to one side at specified distances or over the intersection of signals from two stations.The pilots' role was to use radios and dashboard instruments to verify that the automatic system was taking them where it was supposed to. They also would radio controllers keeping them updated on the plane's location.The primary ground stations are known as V.O.R.'s for "very high frequency omnidirectional range station." These send out radio signals so a crew will know the precise direction from their plane to the station. More advanced stations also have distance-measuring equipment that shows on a cockpit instrument the miles from plane to station.The flight on a clear but moonless night seemed problem-free until the southbound plane neared the V.O.R. station named Tulua.Controllers at Cali had cleared the pilots to fly to the Cali V.O.R. just south of the airport where radar destroyed by guerrillas had never been replaced. The pilots were to report passing Tulua and to keep to an altitude of 15000 feet. That was vital because the assigned route went down a valley between treacherous Andes peaks.The pilots never did report reaching Tulua and the station appears to be a fateful link in the events that led to the crash. Two minutes after the pilots acknowledged that they would report at Tulua controllers radioed that the wind at Cali was calm and asked the crew if they could land from the north.
 4453,  1993, a, A very unusual bridge game was being kibitzed by Dr. Simon Klein of Melville L.I. It was he decided a battle between England and the United States and three of the players were easily identifiable.Sitting in a wheelchair in the West seat and waving his trademark cigarette holder was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His partner wearing a superbly tailored general's uniform was Dwight David Eisenhower a man always ready to shuffle the cards. In the South seat puffing on a cigar was Winston Spencer Churchill a man whose judgment in bridge was decidedly inferior to his judgment in politics.The North player was harder to place although like Churchill he was a writer of renown. William Somerset Maugham was looking at the hand of a long bridge-playing life. With 13 top tricks he could not resist the temptation to announce "seven hearts."This was somewhat naive and he failed to recognize that he was on the razor's edge. A slower approach in the hope of being pushed into a grand slam would have been more subtle. The danger was that an opponent might be provoked into bidding seven spades and that North-South would wind up with a small penalty.

Each of the ''Trio of Fairy Tales'' which is sponsored by General Foods will be given four times - on Fridays and Saturdays at 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. The first is ''Pinocchio'' on July 6 and 7. It is followed on July 13 and 14 by ''Hansel and Gretel'' both of those featuring the life-sized puppets and marionettes of Puppetworks.Then on July 27 and 28 Artreach an award-winning touring theater company brings a live production of ''Rumpelstiltskin'' to the Spanish Courtyard.For reservations to any of the above Caramoor events call 232-5035.The 13th year of free events at the Untermyer Performing Arts Festival is about to begin at the historic Untermyer Park in Yonkers. The first of the six 8 P.M. Saturday concerts presents the Haydn-Mozart Chamber Orchestra. The attractions in subsequent weeks are to be ''The Traveling Russian Village'' two dance evenings a choral program and the Opera Northeast production of Puccini's ''Madame Butterfly.'' Saunders Auditorium is the rain location; for more information call 964-3513.Although a number of summer festivals emulate the Untermyer by alternating dance and concert events Music in the Mountains seems to be the only one offering them in a single evening. This experiment in interdisciplinary programming was tried successfully last year so now there will be two such mixed evenings this Saturday and July 21 on the New Paltz campus of the State University of New York.At the first of these 8 P.M. concerts the Festival Chamber Players share the spotlight with Sarah Stackhouse and Dancers the program listing Ravel's Duo for Violin and Cello the Bartok Contrasts Joan Tower's ''Wings'' for solo dancer and clarinet and George Crumb's eerily fascinating ''Voice of the Whale'' the last with new choreography by Ms. Stackhouse. On July 21 the Chamber Players team up with members of the Jean Erdman Theater of Dance (257-3872).Well worth the trip are the Maverick Concerts in Woodstock N.Y. which are celebrating their 75th anniversary season with 10 Sunday afternoons of chamber music in a sylvan setting.Next week at 3 P.M. the violinist Charles Libove the cellist Roberta Cooper and the pianist Nina Lugovoy will re-create the first Maverick program of July 9 1916 when the music list included piano solos of Schumann and Chopin Christian Sinding's Suite for Violin and Piano the Valentini E major Cello Sonata and trios of Beethoven and Arensky.Among the subsequent performers of renown this summer are the Emerson String Quartet (on July 22) the flute-harpsichord duo of Paula Robison and Kenneth Cooper (Aug. 5) and Brass Ring (Aug. 12). The grand finale on Sept. 2 brings members of the Composers String Quartet and the Dorian Wind Quintet together for the world premiere of an octet by Peter Schickele one of five works commissioned to help celebrate Maverick's Diamond Jubilee season.

 4400,  1994, a, Two United States Navy warships the cruiser Gettysburg and the frigate Halyburton were heading towards the tanker to take the survivors on aboard Daphne Osborne the owners' South African agent said in Cape Town. Two helicopters dropped medicines and supplies to the Hawaiian King.What was to have been a sun-kissed cruise across the equator ended some 150 miles off the coast of Somalia when the fire broke out. According to survivors and shipping officials the ship's engines stopped abruptly.The vessel stirred debate last June when Italy's neo-Fascist National Alliance chartered her for a fund-raising cruise in the Mediterranean and in response to adverse criticism dropped a wreath into the sea in memory of Mr. Klinghoffer.But for many Italians the vessel was "The Big Blue Liner" named for the color of her hull that plied the oceans from North America to Australia and once went around the world in 80 days despite a chronicle of calamities.Today's was not even the ship's first fire. In 1981 a blaze erupted aboard the Achille Lauro in the Canary Islands and two passengers drowned when they jumped overboard. In 1961 she hit a fishing vessel and killed a Neapolitan fisherman.Some passengers were wearing ball gowns and tuxedos when the alarm was raised today said Tony Webb a British businessman who had been aboard and who told his story by radio-phone to The Evening Standard of London."We were alerted at 1:30 A.M. when we heard the engines suddenly shut off" he said. "Most people were at this social event and the captain came on and said we all had to go up on deck because there was a fire."

 2280,  2006, a, And now the latest leads in the seemingly uncrackable case of lonelygirl15 YouTube heartbreaker.(Bree just tell us who you are! We’ll support you!)+ A lawyer in Encino Calif. filed to trademark "lonelygirl15" on August 21 2006. The first commercial use of the trademark is listed as May 24 2006.+ Together with the facts now well-established that fan sites and other relevant urls with the string "lonelygirl15" were registered in advance of the appearance of the first lonelygirl15 video on YouTube this trademark filing appears to confirm suspicions that "lonelygirl15" is not a simple vlog memoir by a homeschooled teenager innocent of commercial connections.+ The most recent lonelygirl15 video however seems to refute the hypothesis that the videos were shot at once some time ago as in "Breethe Cookie Monster" Bree cites the comments section of YouTube Daniel has longer hair than in other vids and Daniel appears to be holding a copy of the current issue of Rolling Stone magazine. (NB: some propose that the cover was Photoshopped in. Wow.)+ The crack forensics team on the lonelygirl15.com forum seems to have established that lonelygirl15’s indoor videos are being made somewhere around Mountain View Calif. CuriousBotanist proposes that some of the plants in the outdoor video "Swimming" only grow in California.+ The reporting of Jon Fine at Business Week has convinced him that a troupe of tatterdemalion troupers made "lonelygirl15" the series as part of an art project or a bid to get noticed. It’s a tender thought. People including me who once believed Bree was merely "sweet" and telling the whole truth now like to hope that she’s at least a more or less autonomous artist as opposed to a pretty monster made of Pixar CGI trying to sell us things.The following figures have denied responsibility for "lonelygirl15"to me. They say they admire the videos and the curiosity they’ve piqued but know almost nothing about their origins or the identity or location of Bree and Daniel.+ Chad Hurley CEO of YouTube+ The filmmaker Brian Flemming+ The filmmaker Chris Wilcha+ "Laguna Beach" cameraman Hisham Abed+ Haxan ("Blair Witch") master Mike Monello+ Jane McGonigal ubiquitous game designer and games researcher+ Jane Jones an actress whose admittedly generic name is also one of Bree’s aliasesIn short the videos are almost definitely more than simply "sweet." The Encino lawyer must know something. And Mountain View Calif. which is near YouTube‘s headquarters is a place to think about.For further study://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-lonelygirl31aug311653379.storyFor serious fevered lg15 fanatics: Keep asking yourself if you’re having fun.

 4383,  1994, a, After the hearing prosecutors released a list of the items found in Mr. Duran's truck that provided insights into the world of a man known to his neighbors as Frank a quiet unobtrusive father of a 5-year-old boy. Some officials said they had begun to suspect that Mr. Duran might have been drawn to the ultraconservative citizen militia movements that have sprung up in several Western states.In a search of the truck early Sunday at the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents found eight compact disks 31 cassette tapes a dozen books 4 newspapers and 9 magazines. None of the individual items were identified but officials described the material as mix of New Age music tapes occult literature and several pornographic magazines.They also found camping gear including extra clothing two pairs of shoes two sleeping bags a black tarpaulin compressed fuel packets rope tools a fishing rod a pair of medic's shears a machete a knife sharpener and a stuffed animal.Agents also discovered weapons-related equipment including a shotgun a gun magazine a gun bag shotgun shells and 20-round boxes of ammunition for the rifle they said was used to shoot at the White House. They also recovered a shoulder holster a gun-cleaning kit and four used targets. The agents also found 22 Atropine injectors syringes filled with premeasured doses of medication used by soldiers as antidote to poison gas. They also found two units of what appeared to be a drug and they were still trying to determine what it might be used for and whether Mr. Duran had taken it.At the Pentagon today officials released more details about Mr. Duran's troubled military career. He enlisted in the Army in February 1988 and was trained as a medic. For more than two years he served as a battalion medic in the 25th Infantry Division based at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.On Aug. 9 1990 after a night of drinking at a bowling alley on post Mr. Duran and a group of other soldiers began arguing with several civilians. When Mr. Duran got in his automobile to leave the records show he drove straight at the group of civilians struck one woman and roared off. Later he was stopped by military police who charged him with drunken driving aggravated assault drunken and disorderly conduct and leaving the scene of accident.It was for this incident that Mr. Duran was dishonorably discharged at court-martial and sentenced to five years at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth Kan. He served two and one-half years of his sentence which was later suspended and he was released on Sept. 3 1993.

 569,  2015, a, To the Editor:Re “Helping to Lift the Burden of Student Debt” (The Upshot Jan. 25) about income-based repayment which caps student loan payments and offers loan forgiveness after 25 years or 10 years for those working in public service jobs:As a law school graduate working as a public defender with over $155000 in combined undergraduate/graduate student load debt I can tell you that the revolution described in the article stopped short at addressing the real issues affecting student loan borrowers like me.While it’s true that the changes in student loan repayment plans have lessened the risk of default for public loan borrowers exclusively income-based repayment plans aren’t addressing the fundamental problems that having enormous student loan debt can have on individuals seeking to grow and attain what I call the “benchmarks of adulthood” — like the inability to save for retirement or save for a down payment on a home or the difficulties of getting a mortgage due to high student loan debt — and the challenges of expanding a family with few financial resources.I’m on the income-based repayment plan and hope one day eight years from now to have my student loan debt forgiven in exchange for providing essential legal services to our community’s most vulnerable. I take pride in my work and hope to continue serving high-need populations but I know that in doing so I am making it difficult if not impossible to reach these benchmarks of adulthood until I’m 40 because my crippling student loan debt simply doesn’t leave me with enough financial resources.Melissa NepomiachiMilwaukee Jan. 26The writer is an assistant public defender in Elkhorn Wis. for the Wisconsin State Public Defender.
 6241,  1973, a, The Cardinals are the principal advisers to the Pope in the government of the church. They form the Sacred College of Cardinals which has often been called the Senate of the church. However since Ecumenical Council Vatican II met from. 1962 to 1965 Pope Paul has created a new advisory body the Bishops' Synod. This group made up of bishops —some of them cardinals—from all over the world last met in the Vatican in the autumn of 1971. It is due to hold its next meeting in the coming year.The most important task of the Sacred College of Cardinals is governing the church collectively as an interim administration during the period of the vacancy of the Holy See after the death of a pope and to elect a new pontiff.When the 30 new cardinals join the college next month it will have a record membership of 145. If the college were called to elect a new pope by that time and no changes occur during the next 31 days 116 cardinals — including all the new ones—would be entitled to take part in the conclave.Pope Paul ruled in November 1970 that cardinals who have reached their 80th years might no longer participate in the election of a new head of the church. However there is no age limit for eligibility to the papacy. This means that theoretically a cardinal who is over 80 may be elected pope.Pope Paul is understood to be considering a reform of the papal election system by which some bishops who are not cardinals and possibly some selected priests would join the conclave.

 3617,  1998, a, To the Editor:Orrin G. Hatch (Op-Ed March 29) is out of touch with reality. If President Clinton lied under oath about an alleged sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky the American people will greet this news with a big yawn. People don't care about it.The world is laughing at us. The soap opera continues with the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr interrogating Ms. Lewinsky's mother and friends to find out who if anyone lied or got someone to lie -- all about whether Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had sex.

 1464,  2010, a, The boom in the high-yield debt markets has bought time and breathing space for companies needing extra financial flexibility. But that has come at a cost according to the latest annual report by Moody’s Investors Service: more than $700 billion will come due between 2012 and 2014.Thanks to both the earlier buyout boom born of an unprecedented wave of cheap credit and the recent reopening of the financial markets companies with speculative-grade paper will find themselves in need of refinancing or repayment in a few years. Whether the improvement in the economy and the rediscovered appetite for risk will head off another disaster remains to be seen Moody’s analysts caution.“If everything behaves normally and you have an efficient market things should be OK” Kevin Cassidy a senior credit officer at Moody’s told DealBook on Monday. “But that’s a big if.”With the onset of the credit crunch in 2008 restructuring professionals — the bankers lawyers and consultants who shepherd clients through reorganizations or bankruptcy filings — found themselves busier than they had been in years. While the number of filings declined later last year these advisers cautioned that a wall of coming maturities could make increase their workloads yet again.According to Moody’s roughly 995 of 1300 issuers have debt that matures between this year and 2014. The coming crush of maturities won’t materialize this year with Moody’s calculating about $21 billion in high-yield debt maturing this year. But in 2014 that number swells to $338 billion in loans and bonds coming due.The story of the explosion in cheap lending during the credit boom is well known at this point and that bubble’s popping has already led to big bankruptcy filings and bracing debt reorganizations. Of the top ten issuers with debt maturities coming due between 2010 and 2014 several are tied to boom-era buyouts including a subsidiary of the utility player TXU (now known as Energy Future Holdings); the hospital operator HCA; the data services provider First Data; and the chip maker Frescale Semiconductor.But 2009 also saw a wave of high-yield debt offerings as well some $145 billion in new junk bond issuances. Over all speculative-grade companies raised about $200 billion in new debt for the year.What’s especially notable is that about 78 percent of that debt was for refinancing existing obligations Moody’s points out. While those loans and increasingly bonds has postponed the day of reckoning for companies it does nothing to relieve their overall debt loads.“Despite significant spread-tightening in the credit markets there remain only limited options for rolling over this debt” Peter Fitzsimmons the North America president for the consulting firm AlixPartners said in a press release last week. “Therefore the potential for a very serious cash crunch could be knocking on the door of Corporate America.”The Moody’s report also raises another concern. With so much of the recent issuances taken up by refinancings it’s not clear how much appetite the high-yield market may have for debt meant for other purposes notably mergers and acquisitions. Deal-makers have predicted that their business will pick up again as the financing markets again become receptive to new offerings.If the overall market for debt grows that won’t be much of a problem. But with banks still largely filled to near-capacity for lending and the hunger among bond investors unknown at this point it’s not clear whether M.&A. will rise to the hoped-for frothier levels anytime soon.— Michael J. de la Merced
 5507,  1987, a, The new American approach would set equal limits on the number of tanks and artillery pieces. The limit would be set at current NATO levels. Some Administration officials said the United States might agree to a proposal that set limits at slightly below NATO levels as West German officials have said to have suggested.If a limit is set at current NATO levels the Warsaw Pact would be required to reduce its force of tanks from about 48000 to about 20000. On artillery pieces the Warsaw Pact would have to reduce the number of its weapons from about 36000 to about 15000.Some Administration officials said the American approach might be expanded in light of the ongoing consultations to include an additional limit on the number of weapons in the central part of Europe. This could be done by setting a limit on non-indigenous forces stationed on the territory of European nations such as Soviet tanks in East Germany and American tanks in West Germany. No Limits on AircraftNo limits would be sought on tactical aircraft an area where NATO has a technological advantage over the Warsaw Pact.Administration officials argued that limits on aircraft are unacceptable because aircraft are ''dual capable'' systems that can carry nuclear-tipped missiles and bombs. NATO has steadfastly refused to include the tactical nuclear weapons in the the talks on conventional arms. The officials also asserted that limits on aircraft would be very hard to verify.But the Soviet Union is expected to seek limits on aircraft and has talked publicly about the need to include tactical nuclear weapons in the new talks.American officials said that there were some differences within the alliance over how to proceed in the talks. West German officials are said to have expressed a concern that a new agreement lead to some reductions on the Western side because West Germany has a declining birth rate and may have to reduce the size of its forces anyway.

 1230,  2012, a, Mike Cassese/ReutersWilliam A. Ackman is playing corporate matchmaker.The hedge fund manager reiterated on Monday his position that General Growth Properties a Chicago-based mall operator should consider selling itself. Shareholders would benefit if the company were combined with the Simon Property Group Mr. Ackman said at the Value Investing Congress in Midtown Manhattan.“I think this thing is ripe for the public to take a very hard look at” he said.Mr. Ackman whose fund Pershing Square Capital Management is a major investor in General Growth has pushed for changes during its bankruptcy. He said on Monday that an announced deal could send the company’s stock price to around $29 a share by the end of the year. The stock which closed Monday just above $19 rose in after-hours trading as Mr. Ackman spoke.General Growth’s stock price shot upward in August after Mr. Ackman revealed his merger proposal but it then fell in September after the company said it would remain independent.As for the Simon Property Group it has offered to buy General Growth in the past but the chief financial officer recently said the company was not interested in a deal.Still Mr. Ackman said he was “quite confident” that Simon would make a bid.“We don’t usually push for sales of companies” Mr. Ackman said on Monday.Complicating matters is Brookfield Asset Management which is steadily increasing its own stake in General Growth Mr. Ackman said. He criticized Brookfield at one point highlighting a letter in which the chief executive compared the company’s investing style to that of Warren E. Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway.“I know Berkshire Hathaway and Brookfield is no Berkshire Hathaway” Mr. Ackman said to laughter from the audience.During the question-and-answer session Mr. Ackman discussed his other well-known investments in J.C. Penney and Procter & Gamble. He also said he had a new short-selling idea which he said he might decide to reveal in the future.“Shorts are even more fun than longs” he said.

 36,  2019, a, The documentary “Apollo 11” — playing in select IMAX theaters now before opening more widely in regular cinemas on Friday — is one of the most rousing movies ever made about NASA and space exploration. The director Todd Douglas Miller and a team of archivists and editors found rare footage of the original manned lunar landing mission and compiled it into a film that’s an immersive and inspiring record of the voyage from launch to splashdown.But “Apollo 11” is far from the only great documentary about humanity’s efforts to explore beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The “space doc” is a small but fertile nonfiction cinema subgenre populated by filmmakers who often partner with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to combine astonishing images with recollections from the small handful of men and women who have dared to venture to the stars.[Read our review of “Apollo 11” a Times Critic’s Pick]Here are five of the best of these movies and how to stream them.

 3924,  1996, a, Any team -- in any sport -- that starts the season 0-7 is often doomed for a horrible year.The Cleveland Cavaliers were 0-7 on Nov. 15. But instead of folding the Cavaliers (15-12) have won 15 of their last 20 games to become one of the most surprising teams in the National Basketball Association.Several players who are unheralded and underrated have helped turn around Cleveland's season. Terrell Brandon has become one of the best point guards in the Eastern Conference. And Bobby Phills who burned the Knicks for 28 points last week is exactly the kind of player the Knicks need: a strong physical shooting guard who can score and defend.Phills had a spectacular game Saturday night scoring a career-high 43 points while making a career-high seven 3-pointers during Cleveland's 124-121 double-overtime victory over Portland.Morale was so low during Cleveland's 0-7 start that the team's owner Gordon Gund and General Manager Wayne Embry called a team meeting to assure the players that the organization had not given up on the season. By trading Price and John Williams during the off season the Cavaliers have started to rebuild but they are still thinking playoffs.
 2700,  2003, a, Alan Nero Hernandez's agent said all of the offers he had received were for one year in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million. The last time he was a free agent in 1999 Hernandez signed a contract with Milwaukee that paid him $10 million for three years plus the $25000 bonus he earned for making the 2002 National League All-Star team.''What has happened'' Nero said ''is this market from the players' point of view is very depressed. Players have to decide whether they want to take massive paycuts or wait their turn. In Jose's case he feels he's coming off a career year and he doesn't feel he should have to take a paycut.''The Mets San Francisco Colorado and Cincinnati are the teams that have pursued Hernandez 33.Steve Phillips the Mets' general manager will not discuss negotiations with a particular player but it is clear he wants to put together the left side of his infield as cheaply as possible. He signed Rey Sanchez -- for a $1.3 million salary and the chance to earn $700000 in bonuses based on playing time -- to keep shortstop warm for José Reyes. He would like to get Hernandez for a similar total.The Mets had Bill Mueller on their list of prospective third basemen but he lost interest in them when Phillips would offer no more than one year. A report circulated among general managers and agents yesterday that Mueller had agreed to a two-year $4.5 million contract with Boston but Mueller's agent Dave Meier said they had no deal. ''We're talking to them but we're not there yet'' he said.Dan O'Dowd the Rockies' general manager acknowledged that he had been talking with Nero about Hernandez. Asked about the low similar offers Hernandez received O'Dowd said: ''I can only speak for ourselves. We just don't have a whole lot of money to work with.''

 4901,  1990, a, The Bush Administration told Congress today how it will distribute nearly $8 billion in United States foreign aid this year. In an indication of its shifting global priorities the Administration plans a dramatic increase in aid to Poland and a sharp decrease in assistance to most of Central America including El Salvador.The overall amounts for the current fiscal year which began Oct. 1 have already been appropriated by Congress with more than 85 percent of the money earmarked for specific countries and the Administration given discretion in deciding how to spend the rest. No further action by Congress is needed.The draft list of allocations prepared by the State Department and sent to a few members of Congress today shows that economic aid for El Salvador $185 million last year is being reduced to $130.6 million this year. Military aid will be $84.6 million about the same as the $85 million last year.The United States has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the Salvadoran Government and the Administration has vigorously resisted efforts by Congressional Democrats to reduce aid to El Salvador because of human rights abuses.

 3541,  1999, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students explore the backgrounds qualifications and platforms of the current Presidential candidates for the 2000 election. Students will work in pairs or small groups to research pertinent information about assigned candidates and create official-looking résumés for their Presidential hopefuls.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Determine what an informed voter should know about all candidates prior to voting in an election.2. Examine the current trend of 2000 Presidential election candidates incorporating their character into their campaign policies by reading and discussing “Candidates Taking a Stand Mix Policy and Persona.”3. Categorize important information that one should know about Presidential candidates into headings commonly found on résumés.4. Investigate in pairs or small groups information about an assigned Presidential candidate to be included in a résumé for that candidate as determined by the class.5. Create official-looking résumés for their Presidential hopefuls including all research information conducted in the appropriate format.Resources / Materials:-student journals-paper-pens/pencils-classroom blackboard-copies of “Candidates Taking a Stand Mix Policy and Persona” (one per student)-ten slips of paper each with the name of one of the Presidential hopefuls (Gary Bauer Bill Bradley Patrick J. Buchanan George W. Bush Steve Forbes Al Gore Orrin Hatch Alan Keyes John McCain Donald Trump)-hat or bag-computers with Internet access (as many as available preferably one per every pair of students)-print resources with information on the 2000 Presidential candidates (newspapers magazines etc.)-a variety of sample résumés (copied from résumé books) for students to use as guides to résumé layout and formActivities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals students respond to the following (written on the board prior to class): How does someone make the decision of which candidate in an election for whom he or she should vote? What are the different things that you would want to know about the candidates if you were voting in the upcoming 2000 Presidential elections? (You may create a list.) Ask students to share their responses. Title a section of your blackboard “What We Want to Know” and add students’ ideas as they share them.2. As a class read and discuss “Candidates Taking a Stand Mix Policy and Persona” focusing on the following questions:a. Read the first three paragraphs. Then respond to the journalist’s questions posed in paragraph 3. What is the role of a candidate’s character when it comes to elections?b. Why might Presidential candidates be developing and presenting “more meaty 10- and 12- point plans earlier in the season than ever before in Presidential politics”? What examples are offered in the article?c. How do “the candidates’ handling of issues (reveal) their won approaches and personalities”? What examples are offered in the article? Why does personality matter in an election?d. Why according to the article do many politicians present detailed plans early in the election process particularly in this Presidential election?e. How can presenting an overly-detailed plan lead people to feel that a politician is getting “tripped up in the minutiae”? How does this relate to some of the 2000 Presidential hopefuls?f. How do political ads reflect a candidate’s character?g. What examples from recent election history are given to support the statement that “candidates have to be mindful that voters do not always take detailed policy proposals at face value”? How does this affect the race for President as supported by the article?h. How do politicians attempt “to use substance to prove their own character”?i. Do you agree with the statement that “the more candidates propose the more they overpromise”? Why or why not? What does the last paragraph leave readers feeling and thinking?3. Explain to students that they will each be working with a partner (or small group of three if class size is larger than 20) to learn about a Presidential hopeful and then to write a résumé about him as if he were applying for the job of President. Refer back to the “What We Want to Know” list and add any necessary categories that relate directly to the organization of a résumé (such as objectives special qualifications previous jobs and education). Then determine where different items on the original list could be categorized and create new résumé categories as necessary. Be sure to include a category or categories explaining the candidate’s positions on social security crime women’s issues the economy education and other important issues of the day.4. Each pair or small group draws a slip of paper from a hat or bag with the name of the Presidential hopeful whom they will be researching. Using all available classroom resources students should research the information that will need to be included in the résumé as determined on the board. It will be very helpful to students if they organize their notes into the categories determined by the class each category on a separate sheet of paper. This way their research will be organized fairly well when it is time for them to transfer the information into résumé form. The Internet will be students’ most valuable resource as there is a vast array of good accurate easy-to-find information there. Suggest that students go to a search engine such as Yahoo! (//www.yahoo.com) AltaVista (//www.altavista.com) or another favorite search engine and type in the name of their candidate. All candidates have at least one Web site devoted to their background and platforms. Students can also find excellent information in newspapers and magazines though this type of information search will probably take longer than searching through Web sites.5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: After all research is complete each pair or small group transfers their research into résumé format developing an official-looking résumé for their Presidential hopeful. Display or hand out sample résumés for students to use as visual guides for the layout and form of their résumés. Résumés should be neatly typed and checked carefully for proper grammar and spelling. In a future class each pair or small group should hand out copies of their Presidential hopeful’s résumé and present his qualifications and platform to the class for discussion. Students might also develop questions for further research on each candidate for the groups to investigate as the campaign continues.Further Questions for Discussion:–What personal qualities should every good leader possess?–How do journalists often insert their own views into the news that they relay?–What information about a candidate’s past do you think is important to know? What do you think is not important?–What different methods do Americans use to determine which political candidate to support?–What are some of the issues that are important topics of debate in recent American political history?–Why do some people choose not to vote?–What are various methods of political campaigning?–What fundamental differences exist between the Democratic and Republican party platforms?–What other political parties exist in the United States and what are their fundamental political platforms?–How do national and international events impact political elections and how people vote?–How might a voter’s gender religion ethnicity age education job and region in which they live affect how he or she votes in an election?–What responsibilities does the media have in presenting information about political candidates?–What responsibilities do political candidates have in being honest to the media?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal response participation in class discussions thorough and accurate research of a Presidential candidate’s background and platforms and thoughtfully- created résumé for this Presidential hopefulVocabulary:persona espousing substance attuned elusive pronouncements intricacies parlance geniality optimism daunting substantive implicit aura subliminal bona fides partisans accelerated minutiae ridiculed remedy mavens deflect integrityExtension Activities:1. Host a mock press conference or debate of Presidential candidates. Ask different students to represent different candidates one student to act as the moderator and the remaining students to act as the press. Each student representing the press should come prepared to the conference or the debate with a series of questions for candidates and those acting as the candidates should be confident in their knowledge of their candidate’s background and platform on different issues. Stage the conference or debate for other classes in your grade or school and then hold a mock election. Determine percentages of votes going to the different candidates and compare them with poll results as the electoral process continues. Interview voters as to how they voted and why and write a news analysis of the process and results for your school newspaper.2. Create a diagram of the electoral process in the race for the Presidency. You may want to locate and analyze a news article related to each step of the process. Additionally the New York Times Learning Network offers a crossword puzzle titled The Electoral Process (//www.nytimes.com/learning/students/xwords/november99_1.html) which incorporates election process and history into its clues.3. Choose a significant issue that surfaces in many if not all of the platforms of the 2000 Presidential election hopefuls. Create a comparison chart detailing where each candidate weighs on this issue. Then examine how each candidate supports his views and write a position paper on your opinions of these platforms.4. Develop an illustrated timeline of changes in voting law in the United States from the 19th century to today. How did different minority groups gain the right to vote and what impact has their voice had on elections? What legislation has been developed to ensure the voting rights of all citizens? What legislation now exists regarding who may run for different offices?5. Research the platforms of candidates in past Presidential elections and how these platforms reflected critical issues in the nation and the world at that time.6. Create biographies or résumés for people who withdrew their candidacy for the 2000 Presidential elections. Where did these people stand on important issues? Why did they drop out of the election?7. Examine your most recent local and/or state elections. What promises did candidates make regarding important issues on a local or state level? How are the elected candidates attempting to meet these needs? What has been the public reaction to these candidates now that they have been elected into office?8. Use The New York Times to follow the campaign of a favorite Presidential hopeful. Create a scrapbook of articles photos and related news items analyzing the successes and failures of the candidate throughout the electoral process. The New York Times on the Web’s political campaign special index (//www.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/) provides articles and columns about the upcoming elections in 2000 plus maps polls and links to campaign ads.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Locate and analyze the texts of historic speeches given by Presidential candidates. How would Americans view these candidates today?Geography- Create a series of maps of the United States that relate to opinion and official polls for the 2000 Presidential election. You may want to color-code candidates or parties to clearly see where political sympathies lie. Then examine why the people in different states may side with a particular candidate.Global History- Research election laws voting methods political parties and governments in other countries. Investigate the successes and obstacles of this year’s first democratic elections in many areas of the world such as in Indonesia.Journalism/Teaching with The Times- Explore how photographs that run in the newspaper affect one’s perception of a candidate’s character. The New York Times on the Web’s Photo Gallery: The Campaign Trail (//www.nytimes.com/library/photos/thecampaigntrail.html) offers the most recent photos of Presidential candidates with related articles. Be sure to also examine photographs from past and present elections in other countries. Create a collage of the pictures that you think best reflect the character of the candidates captured on film.Mathematics- Graph opinion and official polls of Presidential candidates throughout the electoral process. What causes fluctuations in a candidate’s popularity? Who do you predict to win as each poll is released?–Investigate and graph the campaign finances of some or all of the current Presidential hopefuls. Find the appropriate statistics on Web sites such as the Federal Election Commission (//www.fec.gov) Center For Public Integrity (//www.publicintegrity.org) Center for Responsive Politics (//www.opensecrets.org/home/index.asp) Public Disclosures Inc. (//www.tray.com) and Project Vote Smart (//www.vote-smart.org/). Include in your statistical research each candidate’s receipts (money raised) disbursements (money spent) cash on hand top contributors and how much they each have contributed business sector contribution totals and geographic totals (totals or percentages of money from different states or regions of the country). At the bottom of each graph created write a paragraph analyzing what this graph indicates about this candidate and his campaign.Media Studies- Evaluate Presidential campaign advertisements and how candidates both emphasize their views and attempt to point out what they feel are the “flaws” of their opponents. The New York Times on the Web has an extensive video collection of Presidential campaign commercials (//www.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/ads-index.html).Other Information on the Web:Policy.com Issue of the Week: Campaign 2000 (//www.policy.com/issuewk/1999/0719_84/index.html) is an exploration of the candidates issues and campaigns.Democracy Network: Presidential 2000 (//www.democracynet.org/pres2000/) includes an index of election and voter resources candidate Web sites and significant news stories.The American Presidency Online (//gi.grolier.com/presidents/) is a comprehensive site for historical information on the presidency and American politics from Grolier’s.Editorial Cartoons: Campaign 2000 (//www.cagle.com/2000/) offers editorial cartoons on the campaign for the 2000 elections from newspapers around the U.S. updated daily.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Civics Standard 9- Understands the importance of Americans sharing and supporting certain values beliefs and principles of American constitutional democracy.

 5487,  1987, a, The situation seems to call for a tough quarterback and Crocicchia has credentials. He said his nose and his right little finger had been broken while boxing. Amateur boxing? ''No'' he said. College boxing? ''No'' he said ''bar boxing. I took a couple of hits but I can take care of myself. But don't make me out to be a fighter. My mother will kill me.''Before the strike Crocicchia put off job hunting and attempted to keep in shape by running playing tennis and trying to find pass receivers. He got some of his high school teammates to join him after they finished work and threw passes to them.''It's all coming back'' he said. ''I feel a little ahead of the game. Some guys' heads are spinning a bit. I have a grasp. But I need fine-tuning.''Busch was back at South Dakota State taking the 14 credits he needed for his degree helping coach the varsity quarterbacks and wide receivers as a $500-a-season graduate assistant. He was also bagging groceries at the Hy-Vee supermarket in Brookings S.D. for $4 an hour.Now he must take incompletes in his seven courses and when the strike is over he will look for a new job to earn expenses. He said it was all worth it and he cited a comment by Coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears.''He said that all of us are going to be on N.F.L. rosters'' said Busch. ''He said that's one thing they can't take away from you.'' ROSTER AT 52The Giants' roster remained at 52. Because the Giants play Monday night they have until 4 P.M. Monday to reduce the active roster to 45. They may also declare up to 10 players inactive for that game making them more or less a taxi squad. . . . The striking Giants called off their Wednesday-morning practice in Washington Township N.J. because of rain. Gary Reasons lives near the field there and the 18 players who turned up drove to his home. He briefed them on Wednesday's meeting held by Gene Upshaw the executive director of the Players Association with player representatives and other players.

 4164,  1995, a, Last October anticipating a new round of military base closings Air Force analysts used a computer to estimate how much the Defense Department would save if it closed its high-tech military laboratory in Rome N.Y. and merged it with a lab elsewhere.Their October cost-benefit analysis found that moving the lab would be so expensive -- $133.8 million -- that it would far outweigh the $1.5 million in annual savings from closing it. Indeed the computer determined it would take more than 100 years to recoup the price of the move. So the Air Force ranked the Rome laboratory among the last installations it would consider closing.But four months later as politicians across the country lobbied feverishly to save their local bases the Air Force issued a whole new cost-benefit analysis. It said the relocation would cost less than half as much -- $52.8 million -- with big annual savings of $11.5 million.Suddenly the cost of closing Rome Lab could be recouped in just four years. Suddenly the Air Force had the numbers to justify shutting Rome. On Feb. 28 a week after the second computer run the Pentagon made public the list of 119 installations it hoped to close or consolidate this year including for the first time Rome Lab which develops sophisticated electronic equipment for commanders to use to communicate with their forces.

 2745,  2003, a, THE word ''environmentalist'' does not roll easily out of Roger Ullman's mouth. He enunciates each syllable. It is a pleasant if unfamiliar way to define himself. When he says it even for the second or third time he sounds a little like a young contestant in a spelling bee.''I am still trying to get used to it'' he acknowledges.Mr. Ullman 42 with a degree from the Harvard Business School and a career spent in international investment banking including many years as a banker in the developing world left his job as a managing director of investment banking at Merrill Lynch last year.He began work at a much reduced salary for the recently created New York chapter of Environmental Entrepreneurs also known as E2 a small nationwide environmental group made up of about 400 business executives. The group begun about three years ago in Silicon Valley by Bob Epstein who co-founded the database company Sybase Inc. and two other start-ups is part of a growing movement by executives who combine a love of finance and business with environmental concerns. And with skills and connections that many environmentalists may lack they are producing results.''My credo is that economic progress and environmental progress are desirable possible and not mutually exclusive'' he said.

 13,  2019, a, The 2017 tax cut has received pretty bad press and rightly so. Its proponents made big promises about soaring investment and wages and also assured everyone that it would pay for itself; none of that has happened.Yet coverage actually hasn’t been negative enough. The story you mostly read runs something like this: The tax cut has caused corporations to bring some money home but they’ve used it for stock buybacks rather than to raise wages and the boost to growth has been modest. That doesn’t sound great but it’s still better than the reality: No money has in fact been brought home and the tax cut has probably reduced national income. Indeed at least 90 percent of Americans will end up poorer thanks to that cut.Let me explain each point in turn.First when people say that U.S. corporations have “brought money home” they’re referring to dividends overseas subsidiaries have paid to their parent corporations. These did indeed surge briefly in 2018 as the tax law made it advantageous to transfer some assets from the books of those subsidiaries to the home companies; these transactions also showed up as a reduction in the measured stake of the parents in the subsidiaries i.e. as negative direct investment (Figure 1).

 3251,  2000, a, In the interim the officers will remain on modified duty in which they are paid but are assigned to desk jobs without the right to carry a badge or a gun. The other officers aside from Mr. McMellon are expected to return to work in a few days or weeks their lawyers said.Unlike criminal trials in which the evidence must show the defendants are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in police administrative proceedings the department must show that defendants violated a policy based only on a preponderance of the evidence.''We are confident that that review will find the officers blameless in the same manner that the criminal trial did'' Mr. Worth said. ''The facts remain the same.''Officials said the same unit of Internal Affairs investigators known as Group 54 that handled the criminal investigation was likely to handle the upcoming administrative review. The unit will try to determine whether the officers properly followed guidelines and training bulletins that outline the tactics they should use during street encounters and that govern the situations in which it is permissible to fire their guns.The unit's findings will then be presented to a firearms discharge review board a five-member panel led by Chief of Department Joseph Dunne officials said. If the officers are found to have followed procedures the current charges against them would likely be dropped officials said.If the review board were to find that the officers engaged in misconduct their cases would be forwarded to the department's in-house prosecutor for a disciplinary trial in which the verdict would be rendered by an administrative law judge. The judge's decision in such a case would then be forwarded to Police Commissioner Howard Safir who would make the final decision as to any disciplinary action officials said.Although Mr. Safir has spoken in recent days of his compassion for what he described as the trauma the officers have suffered through he has withheld comment on whether they deserve to remain on the force citing the pending investigation.

 2561,  2004, a, DESPITE the ultramodern aura of devices that play compressed digital music files from the Apple iPod player to the Rio Karma they all share one anachronistic trait: they only have two audio channels. The basic stereo format used on vinyl records since the 1950's and carried over to CD's in the 1980's still defines most recorded music.By contrast DVD movies come with Dolby Digital 5.1-channel soundtracks that can parcel the audio among five speakers (and a subwoofer for extra-low tones) to provide the illusion that you are inside the action surrounded by sound.Such surround-sound or multichannel audio is making its way into recorded music through high-end entertainment systems that play Super Audio CD's or DVD Audio discs. But surround sound may soon come to the Internet and hand-held music players as well.The Fraunhofer Institute the German research center that led the effort to create the MP3 digital music format recently announced a new version called MP3 Surround that adds the extra audio channels needed for 5.1 sound without appreciably increasing file size. According to Jürgen Herre of the institute MP3 Surround files can also play in conventional stereo mode on two-channel devices.

 533,  2016, a, ‘Terms of Endearment’WHEN Opens Nov. 16 at 59E59 Theaters.WHY “I was looking for a vehicle for the love of my life” Dan Gordon said. He was romantically involved with Linda Gray when he first adapted the script from the 1983 film and Larry McMurtry novel it is based on. (Ms. Gray starred in its 2007 London premiere.)“I also thought I could put the emphasis back where it belongs” Mr. Gordon said. The screenwriter James L. Brooks “made it about how America treats cancer patients which pulled things off the tracks. I focused on mothers and daughters and lovers and friends.”CHANGES “I had no idea how to end the damn play and was thinking of abandoning the whole thing. I woke up at 2:30 in the morning and my son Zaki who died when he was 22 was sitting on my bed. He said: ‘You’re stuck. It’s easy. Just call me.’ I woke up the next morning and wrote the last scene.”CASTING Michael Parva the director said: “I was not trying to find a Shirley MacLaine Jack Nicholson and Debra Winger. The play has to have its own identity.” Molly Ringwald takes the role that won Ms. MacLaine an Oscar.
 6395,  1970, a, WESTBURY L. I. June 2 —Carmine Abbatiello is the world's best harness racing driver—according to Car mine Abbatiello.The 34‐year‐old horseman from Colt's Neck N. J. where he owns a 45‐acre spread and raises cattle chickens and standardbreds will not hesitate to tell any one that “if I had the stock that Billy Haughton Stanley Dancer George Sholty and some of the other ‘name’ drivers have I'd convince everyone of my greatness.”Most of Abbatiello's col leagues learned long ago that when Carmine “pops off” it is not to be regarded as braggadocio. In fact the ma jority of reinsmen are quite friendly with him and are most respectful to Carmine who currently is the leading driver in North America. His older brother Tony is also an outstanding driver.Must Get Rolling NowThe other drivers often are amused by Carmine's self proclaimed superiority and always are happy to be in his company.

 45,  2019, a, Still wherever Lopez goes he is never far from a disquisition on humanity’s merciless ways. Rising from his bed one night in the tropical heat of Isla Santa Cruz in the Galápagos he walks alone (a frequent habit that makes for some of the book’s best bits) to the beach and watches a group of brown pelicans asleep on the bay. The birds’ vulnerability — “oblivious just now to all that is hidden and potentially threatening in the lightless world we share” — leads his train of thought to Spanish conquistadores releasing vicious dogs on Indians and from there to the European bankers who underwrote the slave trade in West Africa and on to the present horrors of Boko Haram. It’s all ultimately in the service of pondering the roots of barbarism and how we ignore the barbarism unfolding in our own society at our peril.Image Clearcutting near Highway 30 in Oregon. Credit... Leah Nash for The New York Times[ Read our round-up of recent books about climate change. ]Strangely though these relentless reminders of egregious acts don’t diminish the appeal of seeing the world through Lopez’s eyes. His reverence for exploring every corner of the world even the sites of its most shameful histories is infectious. Rarely does Lopez decline an offer of adventure no matter how potentially grueling the trip might be. Traveling he writes “turns the mind toward a consideration of context and releases it from the dictatorship of absolute truths about humanity. It helps one understand that all people do not want to be on the same road.”Lopez’s journeys often start in ways that make you shake your head. (More than a few trips begin with a banal sentence like: “In the austral fall of 1987 I was traveling through Namibia with a few people.” You know as one does.) One night he reads a paper in the scientific journal Nature about the discovery of some 4.27-billion-year-old zircon crystals in remote Western Australia. He immediately emails the researchers about visiting the field site — because he just happens to be headed to Perth soon “en route from Zimbabwe to the Northern Territory.”The scientists initially ignore his request. But he persists and several years later he’s finally on his way to the Jack Hills. He flies from the United States to Sydney and then goes by train to Perth persuading the engineers to let him ride in the locomotive. One day crossing the vast Nullarbor Plain “the train suddenly ran into a wall of water” a drenching rainstorm. When the weather clears a double rainbow appears. And then a mob of kangaroos arrives over a hundred of them leaping across the plain. “The sight of it was so exhilarating the three of us in the cab nodded an affirmation to one another. Whatever was wild and lyrical in the timeless world we were in the middle of it now.”Lopez proceeds in a rented four-wheel drive to a sheep-ranching outpost where a geologist has arranged lodging 120 miles from the nearest town “on an unsigned dirt track.” When he arrives the rancher and his daughter have “a meat pie in the oven and he wanted to know whether I took milk with my tea.” One day as Lopez is heading out to the geology site the rancher offers him a rifle and asks if he’d mind shooting any wild goats he encounters. Lopez declines. But through evening chats on the veranda the two men form a bond; the rancher ultimately visits Lopez at home in Oregon. This knack for making friends in the most unlikely places resonates long after you turn the last page. “Are we not bound” he asks “to learn how to speak with each other?”Had we mastered that skill 30-odd years ago would we be where we find ourselves today grappling with violent xenophobia while forests incinerate oceans rise and acidify magnificent organisms everywhere fade away? Where will we be three decades on if we don’t take heed? There is still time though not as much as there once was to shape what’s coming.

On Tuesday the Hungarian Parliament elected a biologist Bruno Straub as the country's first non-Communist President since World War II. Although the position is largely ceremonial the move is viewed as a gesture toward social forces outside the Communist Party. Extensive Television Coverage

 4771,  1991, a, "Some countries have only expressed sympathy and effectively taken no step to stop the suppression" of the rebellion Teheran radio said. "This double standard demonstrates indifference to the plight of Iraqi civilians on the part of countries which have established human rights commissions ostensibly to defend civilians."Asked today whether the commentary was aimed at the United States Mr. Sarmadi said that it was.Iran which opposed both Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and the presence of United States forces in the region is widely believed to have assisted the Shiite Muslim revolt in southern and central Iraq. But its official stance on Iraq's future leadership is that it will not interfere in the country's internal affairs a position similar to that of the United States.Asked why Washington should be blamed for taking a stance similar to Iran's Mr. Sarmadi said that there were "fundamental differences" between Iran's relationship with Iraq and America's.First he said Iran began establishing better relations with Iraq after its eight-year war."But U.S. forces are in fact at war with Iraq" he said. "Part of Iraqi territory is still under American occupation."Moreover he said Iran had long been supplying humanitarian relief to the Iraqis; the United States has not. These conditions coupled with the Bush Administration's call for Iraqis to rise up against their Government led the Iraqi people to rebel.

Wise was floored.“Really?” he cried. “You serious? Two outs in the ninth? Wow.”Pierce’s oddity in fact is more unusual than a perfect game. It was one of only nine occasions that a pitcher has lost a perfecto with two out in the ninth. The last you’ll remember was the Yankees’ Mike Mussina in 2001. There have been 18 perfect games.Buehrle needed Wise to make one of the greatest catches ever — given the degree of difficulty and the circumstances — to secure his gem. I asked Wise 31 for his favorite defense plays of all-time besides his own and he named three.First was Ken Griffey Jr.’s running airborne catch at the wall in Seattle in 1995 when Griffey broke his wrist robbing Kevin Bass of extra bases. He also mentioned a two-handed over-the-shoulder catch by Andruw Jones that I couldn’t precisely place.“And I like that Ozzie Smith play at shortstop bare-hand where it hits the rock or whatever” Wise said referring to an extraordinary grab from Smith’s 10th game in the majors on April 20 1978. “That was unbelievable to me to be able to lay out the ball takes a funny hop and you’re able to stick your hand up and catch it? That takes a lot of talent man.”It is Griffey who was Wise’s idol as a boy in South Carolina. He wore his hat backward because Griffey did and was thrilled to be his teammate late last season in Chicago and before that in Cincinnati. One spring training Wise said Griffey invited him to dinner on his yacht.“I’d just sit back and watch everything he does and say ‘God this is the guy I grew up idolizing and now I’m sitting beside him playing with him’ ” Wise said. “Man it’s unbelievable.”Now Wise has his own version of the unbelievable a play for the ages. And the mural of Pierce now has two words stenciled above it: THE CATCH.

 5220,  1988, a, JOE ELY delivered twanging stomping full-tilt rock-and-roll at the Ritz 119 East 11th Street on Friday night. For a decade Mr. Ely has been singing and writing songs that match basic rock to lyrics that delight in wordplay and imagery. In the 1970's he put together a band that reflected his Lubbock Tex. background mixing Mexican accordion soul saxophone and country steel guitar with guitar-driven rockabilly; on his 1984 album ''Hi-Res'' he also flirted with computers and synthesizers. Now with his recent album ''Lord of the Highway'' and in concert he's decided to trade eclecticism for punch.His current four-man band sounds closer to the Rolling Stones than to Lubbock's other gift to rock Buddy Holly. But on its own terms the music can challenge Jason and the Scorchers the Georgia Satellites and just about any other heartland rock band.Mr. Ely has become an assured rock frontman shouting out songs with just a little country quaver at the edge of his voice. As before he sings about romance hard travel and breaking loose and he hasn't simplified what he sings to fit the rock format; he still prefers lyrics with wry unheroic twists. ''Lord of the Highway'' written by his longtime associate Butch Hancock may be the only driving song to mention bugs on the windshield; his own ''Me and Billy the Kid'' which he sang at the Ritz as a fast-strummed folky solo is a far cry from most self-glorifying outlaw songs. And the humor in songs like ''My Baby Thinks She's French'' and ''Driving to the Poorhouse in a Limousine'' thrives with a supercharged band behind it.Mr. Ely's set included a guest appearance by Will Sexton a 17-year-old singer and guitarist whose forthcoming debut album was produced by Mr. Ely. Mr. Sexton is a tall hearty Texas blues-rocker who has adapted to 1980's pop image-making; he stepped on stage wearing a black cowboy hat a skin-tight black leather outfit a single earring and impeccable pale face makeup. Fashion aside he belted his three featured songs with honky-tonk gusto and when Mr. Ely returned Mr. Sexton shared some barnstorming lead-guitar duels with David Grissom of the Joe Ely Band.

 14,  2019, a, TOKYO — Kim Jong-un North Korea’s leader said Tuesday that he was willing to have a second summit meeting with President Trump but he paired the offer with a threat that if international sanctions against his country were not lifted the North would “have no choice” but to return to nuclear confrontation.“I am willing to meet the United States president at any time for the betterment of our international community” Mr. Kim said in his New Year’s Day speech broadcast on North Korea’s state-run television. “However if the United States does not keep its promise in our international community and misinterprets our patience and intention and continues with the sanctions then we have no choice for the sake of our national interest and peace of the Korean Peninsula but to come up with new initiatives and new measures.”Wearing a suit and tie and sitting in an overstuffed leather armchair in a book-lined room Mr. Kim offered a largely motivational speech about the need to strengthen the North Korean economy. But he took the opportunity to reiterate a demand that South Korea cease all military drills with “other foreign sources.”“Those should be completely stopped” Mr. Kim said. “That is our stance.”There were sparse direct references in the speech to denuclearization. But Mr. Kim said the country would not be willing to take further steps toward removing its nuclear weapons unless the United States reciprocated.

 974,  2013, a, VideoDespite persistent unemployment malaise and continuing debt problems one sector in Europe seems to be benefiting: European banks.After years of painful job cuts and moves to make portfolios less risky several large European institutions reported strong first-quarter results in recent days helped by cost-cutting and better performance of major units.On Tuesday the Swiss bank UBS and the Lloyds Banking Group of Britain surprised investors by reporting better than expected earnings for the first quarter sending shares of both banks up.The British banks Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC along with the French bank BNP Paribas are among those still scheduled to report first-quarter figures in the coming days. But so far the first-quarter results paint a somewhat encouraging picture of banks that have managed to limit losses from bad loans linked to the credit crisis while reducing costs and returning to their core banking operations: credit and mortgages for some and wealth management for others.UBS for instance reported on Tuesday a first-quarter profit of 988 million Swiss francs ($1 billion). Those results were down slightly from 1 billion francs in the period a year earlier but far exceeded the 412 million francs predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Shares of UBS soared 5.67 percent in trading in Zurich on Tuesday.Sergio P. Ermotti the chief executive cautioned that it was “too early to declare victory” but said the earnings showed the company’s “business model works in practice.”Some investors note that the continuing difficulties in the euro zone and weak demand for loans mean that many European banks remain in trouble despite relatively good earnings in the first quarter.“They are doing their utmost to have a decent banking model and the numbers across the board were very good but going forward we now have the issue of where the growth is going to come from” said Florian Esterer a fund manager at the MainFirst Group in Zurich.Still European banks are moving actively to address their problems including by slashing costs in the face of changing regulations and a sluggish European economy. Deutsche Bank reported on Monday after the markets closed that its first-quarter profit rose as cost-cutting offset a decline in revenue from investment banking. Deutsche Bank’s stock also rose 4.7 percent in Frankfurt on Tuesday on the news that it would issue new shares to bolster its capital reserves.“There are still some headwinds but banks are pretty much there when it comes to reaching the right level of capital and that is helpful” said Cormac Leech an analyst at Liberum Capital.UBS has been eliminating 10000 jobs reducing bonus payments scaling back its investment banking trading business and focusing more on its successful wealth management operation. Those steps helped the bank’s first-quarter results.UBS its Swiss rival Credit Suisse and Barclays of Britain all benefited from higher revenue at its investment banking operation. At Credit Suisse pretax profit in its investment banking division rose 43 percent the bank said last week. Barclays which also reported earnings last Wednesday said pretax profit for its investment bank rose 11 percent in the quarter.Reducing costs and shedding assets also helped Lloyds report a first-quarter net profit of £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion). Those results were a sharp turnaround from the £5 million loss Lloyds posted in the first quarter of 2012.Analysts say European banks are also starting to recover from the fallout from numerous financial scandals that have hurt their reputations.UBS for example has sought to rebuild trust among clients after it uncovered a $2.3 billion trading loss in 2011 connected with the activities of a former trader Kweku M. Adoboli who has since been sentenced to seven years in jail. In December UBS said it would pay $1.5 billion in fines to settle a case related to the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate or Libor.Many of the other large European banks have also been ensnared in the rate-rigging scandal. Deutsche Bank has set aside 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) to cover the potential cost of proceedings that include a tax evasion inquiry in Germany and an international investigation into accusations that its employees and those at other investment banks colluded to fix benchmark interest rates.While financial institutions will continue to address such issues there is a cautious optimism now about bank performance.“There is a new appetite for banks among investors. There’s a confidence that wasn’t there two years ago” Mr. Leech said.Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

 247,  2018, a, The solution — taxis that could only operate away from the areas dominated by yellow cabs — now seems so 2011 which is when the Bloomberg administration first proposed it. The new category of taxis that was created the green cabs could not pick up passengers in Manhattan south of East 96th Street or West 110th Street. They can stop if someone hails them anywhere in the other boroughs except at the airports.By coincidence 2011 is also when Uber began operating in New York.Now some passengers say green cabs tried but never fulfilled their promise.“They filled a crucial void in areas like Harlem where yellow cab service was spotty at best” when they first hit the streets said Derek Q. Johnson who lives in Harlem. “But I think it’s hard to dispute that the ride is better with Uber and Lyft and the reliability is more assured.”Different rules apply to green cabs at airports where they can drop off passengers but cannot pick them up except by prearrangement — for example if they are sent there by a dispatcher. Many drivers complain that those rules force them to go to the airports empty if they are dispatched for a pickup or return empty if they take someone there. Unlike yellow cabs they cannot wait in the taxi lines. Uber and the other ride-hailing apps are not bound by airport rules.The yellow-cab industry responded to the plan for green cabs by going to court. Yellow cab owners worried that the value of their million-dollar medallions would plummet.The city won the court challenge and the value plummeted but not because of competition from the green cabs that went on the streets in 2013.“Unfortunately they came along at the same time as Uber and Lyft” said Mitchell L. Moss a professor at New York University where he is the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management. “The benefit of Uber is it can come pick you up in highly dispersed locations which the green taxi can’t really do because it’s got to stay near dense transit pickup locations.”
 706,  2015, a, Season 2 Episode 5O.K. it’s obvious that writing snippets of a fictional novel so that they can be read aloud on television — a novel whose author we’ve been told is “an incredibly strong writer” — is a losing proposition. They’re never going to be good enough. But when we finally heard bits and pieces of Noah Solloway’s “Descent” on “The Affair” on Sunday night it was hard to have much sympathy for the screenwriter (in this case the playwright Sharr White).“Would she remember him? His voice felt lost in his throat.” “He lifted her skirt just an inch. He paused. They listened together to the sound of the marina hearts shaking in their skin.” “She was sex the very definition of it. She was the reason the word was invented.” From there it just turned pornographic 50 shades of sea foam. The expression on the face of Ruth Wilson as Alison grew progressively darker as she read the manuscript which was supposed to be her response to its growing explicitness but which you’d like to think means that she has more taste than people give her credit for.Alison’s perusal of “Descent” — left out on Yvonne’s work desk — was the dramatic high point of the episode’s first chapter which was devoted to her point of view. Reading the book enraged her because it brought home to her how powerless she was. She’d just been fired as Yvonne’s assistant with a strong hint that it was because of Yvonne’s jealousy fed both by Noah’s book and by how close Yvonne’s husband Robert was getting to Alison. Now she saw herself exploited by Noah depicted as an East End siren with an insatiable sex drive. As she told her ex after she fled back to Montauk “People don’t see me Cole.”The real problem is that “The Affair” itself has never exactly seen her as more than a victim and a bundle of guilt neurosis and small-town working-class awkwardness. (As if you don’t learn a little sophistication growing up in Montauk.) It’s not that her timorousness doesn’t make sense given events but she’s so relentlessly belittled in both the writing and direction that it’s hard to have any real sympathy for her. If she gets out of the subway in Brooklyn she has to be overwhelmed by the city crowd. If she goes into town to run errands for Yvonne she isn’t given the car — she has to be on her rickety bicycle with Yvonne’s packages in a little-girl handlebar basket. When she gets angry she expresses it petulantly and destructively sweeping Yvonne’s books off a shelf. When she helps Robert with his physical therapy the erection he develops is shot in a giggly close-up out of an “American Pie” movie. When she tells Robert the truth about her affair with Noah — already a questionable decision — she uses language like “I felt this bolt of electricity course through me.” Wait maybe that was why she was so upset when she read the manuscript — she actually wrote it!

 115,  2019, a, ImageCharly Evon SimpsonNational Playwrights Conference O’Neill Theater CenterI went to the O’Neill having had two readings of “it’s not a trip it’s a journey” but without having had the opportunity to really workshop the play. The process at the O’Neill starts with what they call a dream design — when designers discuss ideas and questions that came up for them as they read the piece. This session was incredibly helpful to me as it unearthed themes that I had not consciously thought through before.The play is about June a black woman who convinces three of her friends to embark on a road trip. We see the characters in intimate spaces in hotel rooms and in a car and then at real public settings in the wide open United States. Those spaces include Lucy the Elephant a six-story wood and tin elephant replica in New Jersey; the largest ball of twine in Kansas; and the Grand Canyon in Arizona.This dream session put into words and images some of the tensions that exist between the characters. It also delved into the difficulty of creating the real spaces onstage. Lighting and sound cues could signal whether we were inside the car or outside but how would we depict Lucy the Elephant? We brainstormed solutions big and small. Lastly the session gave me and my director Nicole A. Watson insight into how the play wants to work.The next five days were filled with conversations with the cast director dramaturge and other supporters and observers we had in the room. I was able to discover which aspects of the play needed more exploration and spent the evenings rewriting. Two public readings were wonderfully executed by the cast and crew and it was lovely to watch how the audience connected to the characters. The play found firmer ground coming alive in a way I hadn’t seen.

 1855,  2008, a, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed a bill this afternoon requiring manufacturers of computers monitors televisions and other electronic equipment to accept their products for recycling when returned by any person in the city and to dispose of the equipment properly. The legislation was passed by the City Council last Wednesday despite reservations by the mayor over its guidelines.To ensure its passage the Council speaker Christine C. Quinn had withdrawn the original bill and reintroduced it as two pieces of legislation one that begins to establish the program and that Mr. Bloomberg agreed to sign into law and one that sets collection standards that he is expected to veto.Under the legislation that passed electronics manufacturers will devise and run programs that could include curbside pickups neighborhood collections and returns by mail and in stores. Consumers would be required to participate and by 2010 would face a $100 fine for throwing old computers televisions and other gadgets into the trash. Manufacturers who fail to recycle returned merchandise could be fined $1000 for each violation. The programs would require Department of Sanitation approval.Still uncertain are the collection standards which would require manufacturers to take back a stated tonnage of equipment or face fines an element that has angered suppliers who say it would be hard to track sales in the city.Twelve states have already adopted electronic waste laws. New York City is the first municipality to do so the mayor said.The mayor also signed bills requiring timely pruning of trees or vegetation that cover traffic signals or signs; requiring the city’s Department of Transportation to improve conditions at 20 locations with the highest number of traffic accidents; and extending the deadline for submission of the executive budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 to May 2 from April 26.

 3949,  1996, a, The San Diego Chargers signed Miami Dolphins defensive end Marco Coleman to an offer sheet today and in a stunning related move they released running back Natrone Means to help clear room under the salary cap.Means rushed for a team-record 1350 yards in 1994 and helped lead the Chargers to their first Super Bowl. But he held out of training camp last summer in a salary dispute then missed most of the last half of the season with a groin injury.General Manager Bobby Beathard wasn't immediately available for comment. The Chargers who were pleased with the emergence of the rookies Aaron Hayden and Terrell Fletcher apparently expected similar trouble negotiating with Means this year.The Chargers also released wide receiver Shawn Jefferson and tight end Duane Young.Coleman signed an offer for three years at $9.6 million including a $4 million signing bonus. The Dolphins have seven days to match it.
 3284,  2000, a, Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery yesterday by Vice President Al Gore to the International Press Institute in Boston as provided by the Gore campaign:Twenty-five years ago today the last helicopters lifted off from the roof of our embassy in Saigon. Although that brought an end to the war in Vietnam -- a conflict I witnessed with my own eyes -- it did not bring an end to its influence on our thinking about foreign policy.Even now a decade after the end of the cold war we hear echoes of the old arguments. Some seem to believe that with the fall of the old Soviet empire we have nothing more to fear in the world and should dramatically cut our defense budget. Others keep insisting that we continue to prepare to face down a cold war threat that no longer exists and persistently ignore the world as it is. I believe that both groups are locked in a self-destructive argument over a false choice. . . .We are now in a new era. . . . We are now in a global age. . . .We need a new security agenda for the global age based on forward engagement. . . .In the global age we must be prepared to engage in regional conflicts selectively -- where the stability of a region important to our national security is at stake where we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest where we are certain that the use of military force can succeed in doing so where we have allies willing to help share the burden and where the cost is proportionate. America cannot be the world's policeman. But we must reject the new isolationism that says: Don't help anywhere because we cannot help everywhere. . . .

 6055,  1977, a, For the second time in less than a month the Folger Coffee Company has announced that it is reducing the wholesale price of its ground coffee. Yesterday Folger the nation's second largest roaster after the General Foods Corporation trimmed 20 cents from the wholesale price to $3.98 a pound.Folger which is a division of the Procter & Gamble Company became the first major roaster to roll back the price since a July 1975 frost destroyed three‐quarters of Brazil's crop with its first cut of 25 cents a pound on May 12. Before the cut the price was at an all‐time record level of $4.46 a pound.The drop in Folger's list price reflected “declines in imported green coffee prices during the past several weeks” a Folger spokesman said. In White Plains a spokesman for the General Foods Corporation denied reports that the company planned to cut coffee prices.Lockheed Forms UnitThe Lockheed Aircraft Corporation said it formed a new subsidiary the Lockheed Finance Corporation to assist customers in arranging credit for Lockheed products.
 4630,  1992, a, "We tried our best to dignify the sport of soccer" Portugal Coach Carlos Queiroz said. "Too bad the goals did not come. If the field was dry there would be less collisions and fewer lost passes." Preview of 1993 MatchThe match part of the round-robin United States Cup that also features the national teams of Ireland and the United States was far from meaningless. Portugal and Italy will face each other next February in a pivotal World Cup qualifying match. There was some significant sizing up being done today.Italy started a lineup that was nearly as famous as its blue jerseys. Forwards Roberto Baggio and Gianluca Vialli poached near Portugal's goal ineffectively while goaltender Walter Zenga killed time while facing only three shots."Goalkeeping is a strange position" Zenga said. "I do more than make saves. I collaborate with the defense."Italy controlled the match for most of the first half when it seemed as if the young fleet Portuguese were star-gazing or playing for some nonexistent tie breaker. In the second half after a slew of substitutions by both sides Portugal became somewhat more aggressive with its counterattacks.

 4282,  1994, a, Heartened by some soothing words from a governor of the Federal Reserve Board and some good news on inflation the bond market rallied yesterday and carried a depressed stock market with it.The one exception was the Dow Jones industrial average. It rose for much of the day but was dragged down in the session's last 30 minutes. Most of the fall was attributed to a single tobacco stock Philip Morris which was hurt by negative comments last Friday by a Government regulator.And some investors were still nervous about inflation at least judging by the price of gold which Alan Greenspan the chairman of the Federal Reserve recently cited as an important barometer of inflation fears. In New York spot gold futures specifying April delivery rose $2.70 to $382.50 an ounce. Economically Sensitive StocksNonetheless economically sensitive stocks like United Technologies Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and Pacific Gas and Electric benefited from the stock rally as well as technology stocks like MCI Communications Nextel and Comcast which announced a new alliance.
 4177,  1995, a, "I would take anything." he said. "People should take a chance on somebody like me."Now that I got a daughter I would work real hard" he said sounding like the people on confessional television shows which does not mean he did not mean what he said. "I want to finish high school at night and get a real diploma not an equivalency" he said. "I want to marry Jaylene and live with her and the baby. I could do messenger work deliveries sales you know anything."UNTIL he got thrown out of school he had more or less attended Beach Channel High School in the Rockaways traveling an hour and a half each way. "I went there because they had a course in oceanography. I liked that."On 34th Street he said "the Blass Employment Agency is around here someplace. It sends people to work a couple of days at a time. I'll go there." The new father stopped a few workers pushing carts to ask if they knew about it. He spoke in English and Spanish. No luck."Maybe there's a Gap around here someplace and I could get another application." He pointed to a building and said: "That's were I did deliveries until June 16. I kind of miss the place now. I was getting $4.63 an hour. When they hired me they said that after four months I'd get $5 an hour which is what they had paid the guy before me. When they didn't do it I told them they were taking advantage of me and I quit. Later that day my daughter was born."HE walked back and fourth between Seventh and Ninth Avenues through several side streets occasionally entering companies mostly button distributors to ask if they needed help. No one did. Then early in the afternoon with some timidity he approached a guard at Macy's and was given a pass to the personnel department. Along with a dozen others he sat in a waiting room and filled out his application weighing every word of his answers. He had trouble with the boxes for his Social Security number because he had not brought his card and could not remember his number.

 4066,  1996, a, Two of the largest retailers have gone to court to block one of the hottest products of the largest credit card company Visa U.S.A. Inc.Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Limited Inc. filed an antitrust suit against Visa arguing that they should not be forced to accept Visa Check cards -- debit cards with the Visa logo that withdraw purchases from the cardholders checking account. Visa insists that retailers that accept its credit cards must also accept the check cards.The suit filed last Friday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn contends that the merchants must pay a fee for check card transactions that is almost as high as the fee on credit card transactions -- typically between 1.5 percent and 3 percent of the purchase price.The two chains contend that the debit cards can be used as if they were credit cards or cash cards of the type used in automated teller machines. But if they are used as cash cards the fees paid by merchants should be 10 cents a transaction the suit says.
 6271,  1973, a, According to Mr. Zumwalt Mr. Bull took out last July 11 a tape that purported to cover all conversations held in the President's hideaway in the Executive Office Building from April 11 through April 16. It was on April 15 a Sunday that the President talked with Mr. Dean for an hour after 9 P.M. But it was not until Oct. 27 or 28 the White House says that Mr. Buzhardt or anyone else discovered that the tape that Mr. Bull had withdrawn from security on July 11 did not contain the Nixon‐Dean conversation at all. The President's special counsel told the court today that one six‐hour tape had been available in the office in the Executive Office Building to record the April 14–15 weekend and that it had been exhausted during a busy weekend of talk before the Dean conversation began Sunday night.Interviewed after today's hearing Mr. Buzhardt said that the last conversation appearing on the April 15 tape was one between Mr. Nixon and Richard G. Kleindienst then Attorney General after lunch on Sunday.The White House counsel said that no attempt to audit the April 15 tape for the Dean conversation had been made until last weekend because “we thought we were going to win the suit” brought by Archibald Cox then the special Watergate prosecutor to obtain the tapes for the grand jury.Mr. Dean testified before the Senate Watergate committee earlier this year that the President had told him on April 15 that Mr. Nixon had been “foolish” to discuss clemency for E. Howard Hunt Jr. one of the convicted Watergate burglars with Charles W. Colson then special counsel to the President.The second conversation at issue—a telephone conversation with Mr. Mitchell—was never recorded Mr. Buzhardt said yesterday because the President made the call from a hall phone in the White House that was not attached to the recording system.At the White House officials provided anonymously much the same scenario on the unrecorded conversations that Mr. Buzhardt was outlining in Federal court. They said that a six‐hour tape would have handled any ordinary weekend since Mr. Nixon was often out of town on Saturday and Sunday and when he was not rarely used the Executive Office Building facility extensively.Explaining why the missing conversations had been discovered so recently a White House official said “We believed the President would never let go of these tapes and no one believed there was any need to find out what was on them.”

 2349,  2005, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students will examine their own opinions about science and explore how a famous film director is promoting interest in the sciences. They then create public service announcements aimed at young people.Author(s):Michelle Sale The New York Times Learning NetworkBridget Anderson The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Explore personal ideas about and interests in science.2. Consider how James Cameron plans to try to interest the public in the ocean depths by reading and discussing the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences.”3. In groups use an assigned topic to create public service announcements promoting science.4. Complete their PSAs by filming storyboarding or designing them and present them to science classes.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050201tuesday.html (one per student) -resources about various science topics (science textbooks encyclopedias computers with Internet access)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “Director and screenwriter James Cameron said that humans must examine science from a standpoint of ‘wonder awe and mystery.’ What experiences with nature or science have impressed you most? Why? In general do you think your peers are interested in science? Why or why not?” After a few minutes allow students time to share their answers.Using a show of hands ask students: How many of you are interested in science? How many of you want to become scientists or work in a scientific field?Introduce James Cameron the director and screenplay writer who is the focus of the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences” with biographical information found at //www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cam0bio-1.2. As a class read and discuss the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050201tuesday.html) focusing on the following questions:a. What movie is the center of discussion in the article?b. What technologies are used to make this movie?c. How does the author of the article describe the experience of watching the film?d. What argument does James Cameron make about getting people interested in science and research?e. How many dives did it take for Mr. Cameron to get material for his film?f. What was Mr. Cameron’s goal for this film?g. How many submersibles can reach the deepest parts of the ocean?h. What did Mr. Cameron discover about hydrothermal vents through his research?i. What deep-sea topics according to Mr. Cameron are most unknown?j. When will people begin looking at energy issues according to Mr. Cameron?l. Why according to the interview aren’t most people concerned with the depletion of the sea’s “great predatory species”?m. When does Mr. Cameron think people will really understand that global climate change is real?n. What technical challenges did Mr. Cameron face while making “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences”?o. Why doesn’t Mr. Cameron think Hollywood has done a good job in portraying science in movies?p. What motivates scientists to study how the earth works and how life works?q. What type of science is used to make cellphones?r. Why does Mr. Cameron think there is a “backswing” against science?s. What does Mr. Cameron think will be the science stories of the 21st century?t. To Mr. Cameron for what is science a metaphor?3. Divide into groups of four. Explain to students that each group will be responsible for creating a public service announcement (video storyboard or print advertisement depending upon resources) that shows kids that science is “cool” and focuses on a particular science topic.Assign groups a topic mentioned in the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences” such as outer space the ocean depths volcanic activity animal extinction global warming and natural resources. For example the group assigned the deep ocean can focus their PSA on a topic such as deep sea creatures hydrothermal vents or exploration or compile various subtopics into a single PSA with a unifying theme. Encourage students to create a piece that shows how science is relevant to the everyday lives of young people.Direct students to include the following information in their PSA (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):-adjectives to describe science beyond “cool” for a slogan to be used in their PSA (“Science is ”)-fun facts or interesting superlatives relating to your topic-career options and training programs-connections of this area of science to everyday life-importance and value of this topicOnce research is completed groups should work together to brainstorm and complete written scripts for their PSAs.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups should either film storyboard or design their PSAs to be viewed or presented in a future class. (Before leaving class groups should divide responsibilities so that each individual is working on a section for homework.) Other science classes may be invited to see the PSAs.Further Questions for Discussion:-What do you find most interesting about science? Why?-Why don’t some people find science to be interesting?-What do you do to take care of our world and environment?-How is an Imax movie different from a regular movie?-Why are scientists often stereotyped as nerds?-What subjects or issues are you curious about? Why?-How does research help to advance a civilization?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on completion of initial journal assignment participation in class and group discussions and thoughtful completion of planning and creating the PSAs.Vocabulary:celluloid melded geophysics enchanted submersibles canvassed biologists geologists riotously chemosynthesis photosynthesis resilience organisms hydrothermal volcanism periodically clarion predatory hybrid mariculture apex stimulus thermal insurmountable rig idiosyncratic villains materialistic aesthetically pharmaceutical semiconductors quantum electromagnetic ascendancy agrarian efficiencies pollution metaphoricallyExtension Activities:1. Write a report on a famous scientist who has worked or is working in the area of science you examined during class.2. Create a brochure about the relationship between humans and the ocean. Include both what humans get out of the oceans (in terms of natural resources environmental stability) and how humans influence the oceans. Also include how changes to the ocean will affect people both directly and indirectly and in the short term and long term.3. Watch a movie that is centered on a scientific phenomenon such as “Twister” (1996) “The Day After Tomorrow” (2004) or “Jurassic Park” (1993). Write a reaction paper about how accurately or inaccurately science is portrayed. Include examples of how science is portrayed as well as your assessment of how it was represented. Then grade the movie on its scientific accuracy. Compile each individual report into a science movie review section for the school newspaper.Interdisciplinary Connections:Fine Arts – Create an artistic representation of a scientific concept. You may choose to create a performance painting collage film poem etc. Your creation must include the basic concepts and elements of the science but also should reflect on the “wonder awe and mystery” of this concept or idea.Technology -Create a diagram of a submersible used to study the deep ocean. Include its appearance what materials it is made of the kinds of equipment that are inside how they are powered and how they communicate with the surface and what sort of conditions it needs to be able to withstand to survive deep ocean exploration.-Create a “How It Works” poster explaining how a 3-D film is made including the role the special glasses play in viewing this special effect.Journalism – Interview a local scientist about his or her career and work and the importance of science in the world. Write an article for the school newspaper.Teaching with The Times – Read an article in the Science Times and write a reflection paper examining the facts ideas or concepts that are most interesting to you.

 3180,  2001, a, ''It doesn't take a leap of imagination to expect that at some point those nations will work with those terrorist networks and assist them in achieving and obtaining those kinds of capabilities'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.Mr. Rumsfeld speaking on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' did not name those terrorist-supporting nations. But a Department of Defense report released in January said that Iraq Iran Syria Sudan and Libya all have active chemical or biological weapons programs. In addition Iraq and Iran are trying to acquire materials for nuclear devices the report said. Those nations all are on the State Department's list of governments thought to sponsor international terrorism.Mr. Rumsfeld is preparing to release the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review an assessment of the nation's defense needs mandated by Congress. The document which will be sent to Congress on Monday focuses heavily on the need to protect the United States against terrorism and ballistic missile attacks and on the proliferation of chemical biological and nuclear weapons.Mr. Rumsfeld said today that the military was in the process of adjusting its command structure to deal with terrorism. ''There's always been terrorism'' he said ''but there's never really been worldwide terrorism at a time when the weapons have been as powerful as they are today with chemical and biological and nuclear weapons spreading to countries that harbor terrorists.''The defense secretary's concerns were repeated by Mr. Card. ''I'm not trying to be an alarmist'' Mr. Card said on ''Fox News Sunday'' ''but we know that these terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda run by Osama bin Laden and others have probably found the means to use biological or chemical warfare.''But for all the concerns that terrorists armed with chemical or biological weapons would have for the general public Pentagon officials say they are most immediately worried about the safety of American military forces.Asked today whether the United States was worried that military conflict in South Asia might destabilize Pakistan which has nuclear weapons Mr. Rumsfeld said yes. And asked if the United States would soon turn its attention to nations other than Afghanistan that support terrorism like Iraq Mr. Rumsfeld replied ''I think we're already turning our attention to other states.''

 4814,  1991, a, The choice of the Narragansett Hotel a home to many college students during the school year was not the Cheikh's; his followers in New York picked it for him."We were looking for two weeks" said Mouhamadou Lamime Diagne a trade analyst who picked up the Cheikh at the airport. The Narragansett a mostly single-room occupancy hotel near 93d Street "was the one we found so he will be near the community" Mr. Diagne said. Most Senegalese in New York live in Harlem.Cheikh Mbacke's visit lately an annual event has become a spectacle. When he emerges from the hotel each morning he is surrounded by a security team. They have to contend with some of the Cheikh's followers waiting outside who rush toward him hoping to touch his clothing. "We keep telling him he should move to Central Park West" said one security officer with walkie-talkie in hand. "It's impossible to protect people here."The 74-year-old Cheikh then climbs into a limousine and goes off in a motorcade that takes him around the city.Inside the hotel hundreds of visitors arrive in the course of a day -- some in bright robes some in gaudy T-shirts some in business suits. Many pack the elevator to see the Cheikh who is on the eighth floor with his retinue of about 15 people most of them older men. When visitors arrive he retreats behind a veiled doorway to greet them.

He was 68 and lived in nearby Pelham Manor.The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage the university said.Dr. Auslander was equally at home in the divergent branches of pure and applied mathematics as evidenced in his voluminous output of books and research papers. He had been on the CUNY faculty since 1971 when he joined the sprawling institution's elite group of teachers recognized as distinguished professors.A native of Brooklyn he graduated from Columbia College in 1949 and then earned an M.A. at Columbia. He received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1954 shortly after starting his teaching career as an instructor at Yale University.He advanced through the academic ranks at the University of Pennsylvania and Indiana University was appointed a full professor at Purdue University in 1962 and taught at the Belfer Graduate School of Science Yeshiva University before joining the CUNY faculty.
 251,  2018, a, The middle-aged woman looked out into the crowded emergency room. Sherry could barely remember driving herself to the hospital. She couldn’t remember at all how she got from her car to the door of the E.R. She couldn’t remember the nurses taking her blood pressure or placing the IV into the permanent port that had been inserted under the skin of her chest for the blood transfusions she had needed for years. But she knew all of this must have happened because she was watching the dark red liquid drip from the bag down the tubing into the needle that disappeared into her chest.It scared her. Not the blood transfusion — she had dozens of them over these past 18 years. She was scared by the degree of impairment she must have had while driving here. When her blood count got really low she couldn’t think straight; she knew this about herself. And yet she had driven the 12 miles from her home in suburban Austin to this hospital in a condition she now knew was unsafe. She had been behind the wheel when she was severely impaired. Not by drugs or alcohol but by a brain starved of sufficient blood. Sherry knew she would have been angry if her children had driven in a similar state. She felt embarrassed and ashamed of her own recklessness.She watched the second unit of blood ease into her system. She felt like every drop helped her feel just a little stronger think just a little more clearly. When the transfusion was done she was eager to go. They checked her blood to make certain it was at a safe level and when reassured discharged her.When she got home she told her husband and teenage children what had happened. “Never let me do that again” she begged them. If they saw her with the car keys in her hands they needed to talk to her to make sure she was making sense. If she wasn’t able to carry on a conversation she was sure she shouldn’t be allowed to drive. Why didn’t you ask for a ride? her older daughter asked. We were all here. Sherry felt her face redden. I guess I was too impaired to know how impaired I was she confessed.A Long History of DeficiencySherry had been anemic for most of her life. When she was very young her mother told her her doctor had put her on iron drops. In middle school another doctor had put her on iron pills. And she took them — even though they made her constipated and hurt her stomach. When she was in her 20s she was again put on iron pills. But through all this she felt fine. She finished high school started college finished nursing school and married. She had two kids. Sure she was tired some of the time. But not she thought more tired than other women who had husbands careers and kids.Help Dr. Lisa Sanders solve this medical mystery. Click here to submit your diagnosis.But then in 2001 when she was pregnant with her third child Sherry’s OB got worried. She was he told her very anemic. Pregnant woman often have blood levels that look anemic but aren’t. That’s because blood counts are determined by the number of red blood cells per amount of fluid in our arteries. And in pregnancy there’s a lot more fluid in the circulation and so the blood is more dilute. A normal blood level or hemoglobin for a woman is 12 grams of red blood cells per each liter of fluid. For pregnant women the “normal” level drops to between 10 and 11. Sherry’s hemoglobin level she was told was less than 8. Because blood is essential for fetal growth and development the obstetrician insisted that Sherry have a transfusion — her first. That one infusion of red blood cells got Sherry through her pregnancy but it seemed that after that she was constantly anemic. She took iron pills three times a day for as many days as she could manage. But even with that her hemoglobin level was usually between 9 and 10 and her iron was often barely detectable.↓Precious MetalFor the next several years Sherry worked hard to keep taking her iron but every year she seemed to be losing ground. No matter how much iron she took she could feel herself getting more and more tired. She started to crave ice — a strange but common symptom in those who don’t have enough iron to make the blood they need. And despite her best efforts when her iron levels were measured they were always low.Her gynecologist thought it was the heavy menstrual flow she developed after the birth of her last baby and recommended a procedure to permanently remove the lining of the uterus that causes the monthly bleed. She had that done and it stopped her bleeding but it didn’t keep her from being anemic.↓A Shot in the ArmHer doctor then suggested that she try getting her iron supplements intravenously rather than taking it as a pill. After the first treatment Sherry felt energetic. Her fatigue disappeared. She felt great. But it didn’t last. Whenever she found herself carrying around cups of ice again she would call her doctor. Her blood counts continued to measure low sometimes dangerously so. She started seeing a blood specialist a hematologist who put her on a monthly dose of intravenous iron.Her hematologist noted that sometimes Sherry’s blood count would drop suddenly. One report showed Sherry’s count drop from 7.1 to 6.4 overnight. There aren’t many medical problems that could cause such a drop. A significant episode of bleeding might do that. But Sherry said she hadn’t noticed any blood loss. She did notice an episode of dark urine over the weekend while camping with her family. Her hematologist suspected that maybe her last transfusion had caused a reaction leading her immune system to destroy the new blood. That kind of destruction could cause a loss of blood and its constituent iron as the recycling systems would be flooded and overwhelmed. He looked for evidence of red blood cell destruction. He didn’t find it.Help Dr. Lisa Sanders solve this medical mystery. Click here to submit your diagnosis.Still what else could cause her blood counts to drop this way? He started her on high-dose steroids. If her anemia were caused by her own immune system the steroids which suppress that system would help. Remarkably her blood counts stabilized almost immediately. She had required six units of blood early in the month to get her hemoglobin above 7. Two weeks after starting the steroids her blood counts remained high — for her. And they stayed that way for several months. To Sherry’s hematologist this suggested that her anemia was caused by her immune system interfering with either some process in the way blood was made or possibly destroying the blood itself. He couldn’t find direct evidence of either but the fact that the steroids helped supported his hypothesis.Steroid medications like prednisone or dexamethasone — which is what this patient was on — are powerful immune-suppressing medications. They can also cause terrible side effects. Infections are more common because these drugs are so effective at suppressing the system dedicated to fighting them off. Steroids can also damage the tough lining of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. They can damage joints. They make healing more difficult. And they made Sherry’s stomach hurt. Because of all these potential harms the hematologist wanted to find a medication to replace the dexamethasone. He tried infusing antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) from other people’s systems — a drug called IVIG short for intravenous immunoglobulins. That seemed to work but whenever he tried to reduce or eliminate the dexamethasone her blood count and iron level would plummet. You can see some of the early notes from the hematologist below.When her hematologist left the practice she switched to his partner. He tried adding a different less dangerous immune-suppressing medication called Rituxan. But again when he tried to get rid of the dexamethasone or even just lower the dose her need for blood and iron would lurch upward. How could she get the benefits of the steroids without the risk? He adjusted the doses — could he increase the IVIG and rituximab and just keep her on a very low dose of dexamethasone? These frequent transfusions — nearly one a month — and biweekly infusions of iron carried their own risks. When the Rituxan didn’t help the decision was made to remove Sherry’s spleen. Removing this organ basically a very large lymph node has been shown to be helpful in treating autoimmune disorders of the blood. The thinking is that the spleen traps the red blood cells that have been targeted by the rogue antibodies. Once trapped there the red blood cells are destroyed. Although no one had ever found any evidence that Sherry had an autoimmune disorder it was the most likely cause of her chronic anemia. The splenectomy was a bigger operation than expected but once Sherry recovered the frequency of her blood transfusions dropped from twice a month to once a month and then to twice a year or less. To see the note about splenectomy see below.↓A Terrible ComplicationAfter two and a half years of high-dose steroids Sherry’s body gave the signal that she’d had enough. She developed an ulcer in her stomach which over time ate its way through the full thickness of the muscle causing a rupture. Her stomach’s contents and all its acid were splattered throughout her abdomen. She was on vacation with her family in New Orleans. They’d been walking around the beautiful old city all morning and her kids wanted to go to the zoo. She had been having trouble with her back for most of the holiday and said she’d go back to the hotel and rest while her husband took them to see the animals. When they got back they found her pale sweaty and doubled over in pain. She initially diagnosed herself with a kidney stone but when the pain worsened she allowed her son to call 911. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital where the perforation was closed. She required several more surgeries that year to fully repair the damage done.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you our readers to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.For the past several years Sherry’s doctors have been trying to manage her anemia with IVIG alone. Because iron can build up in the body causing organ damage the doctors have been relying more on blood transfusion. They follow her blood counts and iron levels closely and replete only when necessary. As it has throughout her life Sherry’s disease seems to wax and wane. She needed only occasional blood or iron from 2013 until 2016. In 2017 she got blood about every other month and iron only three times. This year it has been about the same.↓A Slew of TestingThroughout all this her doctors have been searching for a cause of Sherry’s persistent iron deficiency anemia. She has been tested for evidence of red blood cell destruction or hemolysis. None has been found. They continue to suspect an autoimmune process though again none of the tests have shown any signs of an immune system gone wild. She has been tested for a rare disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria — an acquired abnormality in the red blood cell itself that causes the (normal) immune system to mistake the cells for invaders and try to destroy them. Only a minority of patients with this disease have the characteristic red urine seen first thing in the morning that gave the disease its name. She has had five colonoscopies and several upper endoscopies to look unsuccessfully for a loss of blood there. Three bone-marrow biopsies have shown good production of red blood cells. Results from a few of these study results can be seen here along with her hematologist’s most recent note.She has seen several of the doctors in a large practice specializing in disorders of the blood. A couple of them have wondered if she causes the drops in her blood counts intentionally. One doctor Sherry tells me even asked his nurses to examine her body for signs that she was bleeding herself. They didn’t find anything. The past few years Sherry has been distracted from her anemia by the many surgeries she has needed on her large joints probably because of her years on steroids. She has had both hips replaced. And both shoulders were replaced. Twice. But to the extent she can she tries not to let any of this slow her down. She did have to retire from nursing. It broke her heart she told me. But she worried that the clarity of her thinking was unpredictable and she couldn’t expose those children to the risk that she would miss something because her blood levels were low.Now she just tries to take care of her teenage children. And a patient husband. And of course her own body when she has to.Have you seen anything like this? Do you know what Sherry has and why she continues to need blood transfusions? If so please let us know. Your suggestions will be shared with the patient who will share them with her doctor. Help us find an answer for Sherry. Enter your comments below and I’ll let you know what happens in the case as it develops. Please briefly describe your thinking. How a diagnosis is made is often as revealing as the diagnosis itself. And let’s see if we can figure this one out.

 2916,  2002, a, WHEN Stephen Sondheim extolled the virtues of ''the little things you do together'' in the musical ''Company'' eating candy was nowhere on the list. Now Mars the confectionery giant that makes Milky Way is revamping the brand's advertising in most markets around the world to promote the candy bar as one of life's small delights.In a campaign that begins today in the United States and in May in Britain and Europe offices of Grey Worldwide the brand's new agency are asserting that it provides ''Pleasure you can't measure.''The American part of the campaign features television commercials comparing Milky Way to momentary thrills that deliver frissons of good feelings. Among them: reaching that itchy spot with a back scratcher breaking the bubbles in shrink wrap with a satisfying popping sound making a friend's hair stand on end with a balloon and watching a car odometer turn over from 99999 miles.Those pleasures are perhaps minuscule to the point of invisibility. But when consumers have long since learned to ignore or even mock the hyperbole of advertising offering a scaled-down easily delivered benefit may be no small feat. That is particularly true when seeking to stimulate sales for venerable brands like Milky Way because breathlessly Bunyanesque claims are less likely to be believable with familiar products.

 1102,  2012, a, Susan Walsh/Associated PressLast week both The Washington Post and The Times published illuminating stories on the growing affluence of members of Congress. Both stories — Peter Whoriskey’s in the Post and Eric Lichtblau’s in the Times — demonstrate how the economic fortunes of those elected to Congress have diverged radically from those of the men and women they represent.For members of Congress Lichtblau wrote median net worth “is $913000 and climbing” while for families in the country at large it’s “$100000 and has dropped significantly since 2004.”The articles demonstrate one of the crucial differences that separate federal elected officials from the rest of America. Members of the House and Senate are treated with inflated deference throughout their working days on Capitol Hill. They have their own police force a research service and a cast of thousands of subordinates and special services including doorkeepers committee aides private restaurants free mailing privileges television studios airport parking without charge and more.Each member of the House can hire a personal staff of 18 full-time and four part-time workers all of whom devote their entire working lives to their bosses. Each representative controls his or her own annual budget ranging from $1.4 million to $1.7 million depending on the distance from Washington that the member needs to travel.Senators’ personal staffs range from 26 to 60 depending on the size of their state. Each senator controls an office budget that runs from $2960726 for those representing Delaware to $4685279 for each of the two senators from California.There are all together a total of 6804 House employees and an estimated 7000 Senate staffers all of whom are there to pay assiduous attention to the wishes of members. Unlike the average worker who now faces hard times if laid off a member who loses re-election (or voluntarily retires) is virtually certain to have the option of a job paying in the $1 million-plus range in Washington’s influence-peddling industry.In addition to the many benefits flowing to Congress there is another factor distorting members’ view of the country at large that gets very little attention: Washington itself.Representatives and senators work and in many cases live in a city that does not reflect the makeup of the country. Instead the city magnifies and exaggerates racial polarization.The poor in the District of Columbia are overwhelmingly black. The city’s white population has a 6 percent poverty rate lower than the white rate in every state according to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The national average is 13 percent and the closest competitors are Connecticut and New Jersey each of which has an 8 percent white poverty rate. The Census Bureau defines poverty for a family of four as an income of $22314 or less.While the scope of poverty in Washington is well documented another recent story in the Washington Post provided some insight into just how insulated the world of the city’s well-to-do has become. Reporter J. Freedom du Lac spent the day at a wine store in the city’s prosperous virtually all-white Cleveland Park neighborhood not long before New Year’s Eve. The store’s clientele includes Capitol Hill staffers political operatives political appointees even the odd Supreme Court justice.Hanging out in the store du Lac writes opened up “a window not only into the way the city celebrates but also into its high-flying wealth. Washington boasts some of the country’s richest neighborhoods and most affluent households many of which thrived during the economic downturn.” The store’s warehouse manager was amazed when “this guy picked up like six cases for $3600. That’s a mortgage right there.” Another employee told du Lac “There’s big tickets all day every day — people spending $1100 on one bottle. That was unheard of to me unbelievable. But it’s common. This place attracts people with money.”Black residents of Washington have a poverty rate of 27 percent very close to the national average of 27.4 percent. Since the population of the city is 50.7 percent black this translates to an estimated 83590 blacks in poverty in the city compared to 12560 whites in poverty in the area a black to white ratio of 6.7 to 1. In essence for every poor white in the city there are nearly seven African-Americans living beneath the poverty line.In the entire United States where blacks make up 12.6 percent of the population the ratio is reversed. There were 19.5 million non-Hispanic whites under the poverty line and 10.9 million blacks a black to white ratio of 1 to 1.8. In other words in the entire country for every poor black there are nearly two whites living under the poverty line. Nationally according to the most recent census data the 2010 poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was 9.9 percent and for blacks 27.4 percentMembers of Congress are attuned to the economic conditions in their home districts and states but living and working in Washington for much if not most of their time encourages the view that poverty is a black problem.The overwhelming importance of race in defining poverty in Washington is also true of unemployment and crime.The 2010 inmate population in the District of Columbia according to the Department of Corrections was 88 percent black 6 percent Hispanic and 2 percent white. In contrast the national state and federal prison population in 2010 was 37.7 percent black 32.0 percent white and 22.2 percent HispanicIn the case of unemployment in Washington joblessness is heavily concentrated among blacks. A local think tank the DC Fiscal Policy Institute found that from 2007 to September 2011 the unemployment rate for blacks in the city doubled going from 10 percent to 20.6 percent.Hispanic unemployment declined from 9.6 percent in 2007 to 7.9 percent in September 2011. Joblessness among whites increased but from a minuscule starting point of 1.9 percent in 2007 to 3.7 percent in September.The figures for the nation as a whole in September 2011 were also different: black unemployment nationally was 16 percent white unemployment was at 8 percent and Hispanic joblessness was at 11.3 percent.All these factors contribute to the effective racialization of inequality in the nation’s capital. It does so at a time when rising inequality is an issue Democrats and liberal advocacy groups are trying to emphasize during the upcoming election campaign.Nationally as the world now knows rising inequality has been driven by the huge income gains among the top 1 percent and even more so for the top 0.1 percent.For the average wage earner income has declined in recent years. Median income for all households adjusted for inflation fell 6.4 percent from 2007 ($52823) to 2010 ($49445) according to the census. For white households the drop 5.4 percent $57752 to $54620 has been less severe than the 10.1 percent decline for black households $35665 to $32068 and the 7.2 percent decline for Hispanic households $40673 to $37759.In terms of wealth and assets the recent deterioration nationally driven by the economic collapse has been most severe among blacks and Hispanics although whites have certainly not been exempt.From 2005 to 2009 the median net worth of black households fell by a brutal 53 percent from an already low figure of $12124 to $5677 according to the Pew Research Center. Median Hispanic household net worth fell even more 66 percent from $18359 to $6325. White households experienced a more modest but still painful 16 percent drop from $134992 to $113149.In Washington inequality is driven almost entirely by the differences between the wages paid to whites and blacks. In 2010 whites earned $3.08 for every $1 earned by blacks. The black-white income difference is higher in the city than it is in any of the 11 surrounding counties in Virginia and Maryland. Overall in the entire region whites earn an average of $1.80 for every dollar earned by blacks.The result is that the capital of the United States has a higher level of inequality than any state in the nation. Among the nation’s cities it has the third-highest level of inequality behind Atlanta and New Orleans according to three different measures used by the census.The unrepresentative character of the city serves to reinforce conservative stereotypes: That unemployment and poverty are essentially black problems that violent crime is committed mainly by African-Americans and that any spending to relieve these problems or any other domestic trouble will amount to a transfer of income from whites to blacks.To top off the corrupting and warping effects of the forces pressing on House members and senators in Washington their sense of self-importance is magnified by the power of Congress over the local government.Congress in one of the most undemocratic processes in the nation can veto legislation passed by the City Council and signed into law by the mayor; all city judges must be approved by Congress; and Congress can impose laws on the city. And of course Washington residents do not have voting representation in either the House or the Senate.This is not just a theoretical issue. At various times since 1988 for example Congress has enacted temporary bans against the use of locally raised taxes or fees to finance abortions in the city and most recently on May 4 the House voted 251-175 with all 235 Republicans present voting yes to make the ban permanent.Congress has constitutional authority to exercise these powers but it would be far less likely to do so if the city’s majority population was white rather than black. If power corrupts in America race often leads to the corrupt exercise of power and to the denial of political autonomy.The distortion of economic and racial reality for members of Congress living and working in Washington contributes to their tendency to view the consequences of budget cuts and austerity measures as affecting primarily individuals and families with whom they believe they have little in common. They often see or choose to see these people as separate and apart from both themselves and from the mainstream of the United States.Thomas B. Edsall a professor of journalism at Columbia University is the author of the forthcoming book “The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics.”
 462,  2016, a, The origin story behind the British pajama brand Desmond & Dempsey is romantic-comedy cute. Its founders Molly Goddard and Joel Jeffery (she’s a charming loopy Australian; he’s a composed soft-spoken Brit) met in a Canadian ski town and fell in love long-distance. When Goddard made the move to London she brought her collection of “frilly little nighties” with her but soon switched to wearing Jeffery’s button-ups around the house for the sake of modesty around his flatmates — a practice that soon became a problem thanks to Goddard’s self-professed clumsiness. “I’d wake up and there are breakfast stains all over them and I was like ‘Molly I have to wear this to work!’” Jeffery says of those shirts.“And Joel’s like proper English never spills anything” Goddard rejoins with an infectious giggle. “And one day he was like ‘I know you moved all the way over here and it’s really nice but you have to get your own pajamas!’” They went out in search of a pair that fit her specifications — light breathable cotton in a cut inspired by men’s wear but tailored for a woman — and came up short. “There’s so many silk brands and I was like ‘They’re beautiful but you can’t wash them’” Goddard says. “Sorry that’s not going to work.”So they made their own starting with their first hundred sets in Sept. 2014 under the moniker Desmond & Dempsey which comes from their grandfathers’ names. Gray and navy styles feature smart white piping (“My grandma taught me that when you iron it and you shake it out the piping holds the structure of the garment” Goddard says) while pineapple and botanical prints were hand-painted by Jeffery’s brother a graphic designer for Adidas. Interest soon came in from stockists including Fortnum & Mason in London and Bergdorf Goodman in New York.

 502,  2016, a, Mexico City — Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto had already had a terrible summer. July was the most murderous month in Mexico since he took office in 2012. Second-quarter results showed negative economic growth for the first time in three years. A survey found his approval rating slipping to 23 percent. And a news report even alleged that he plagiarized nearly a third of his law degree thesis. How could he make it any worse? Only by inviting Donald J. Trump one of the most hated men in Mexico — so hated that piñatas with his visage are brisk sellers across the country — to his presidential palace.The curious thing about Mr. Peña Nieto’s latest debacle is how unlike his other woes it was totally self-inflicted. There is little tradition of sitting Mexican leaders meeting with American presidential hopefuls so he was under no pressure to arrange the get-together. And it couldn’t have come at a worse time: the very day of Mr. Trump’s hard-hitting immigration speech and the day before Mr. Peña Nieto’s state of the union address. Mr. Peña Nieto had even compared Mr. Trump to Hitler.But in a stupefying decision last week he sent invitations out to the Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump to come to Mexico and then conceded reportedly under pressure from the Trump team to meet its candidate first on the fateful Aug. 31.

 5616,  1986, a, When the Equine Drug Testing Program at Cornell University reversed itself three weeks ago on the finding of a banned medication in a horse that had run fourth in the Breeders' Cup Turf last November virtually everyone in New York racing was suddenly asking the same question: If a mistake had occurred in post-race testing of one of the year's premier events could the testing done on tens of thousands of other races in the state annually be trusted?The question speaks to the essence of public confidence in the sport. Some of the leading thoroughbred trainers of recent years particularly those specializing in the lower-grade claiming races that make up the bulk of daily cards emerged from obscurity with an uncanny knack for improving the performances of other trainers' castoffs. Horseplayers matter-of-factly refer to these trainers as ''chemists'' and ''juicers.''The State Racing and Wagering Board is still investigating the recent incident in which Lashkari was initially disqualified from the Breeders' Cup race after testing positive for Etorphine small doses of which act as a stimulant and was then reinstated when four other laboratories contradicted the finding. The board's inquiry has turned up irregularities in work done by technicians at the Cornell lab which performs all initial tests on the first four finishers in New York races. One lab employee has resigned and another has been reassigned.But while the investigation continues the board's early sentiment suggests that the Lashkari case far from undermining the lab's authority will prove to be a rare kind of exception. ''We have not reached our final conclusions and we're still evaluating our future relationship with the Cornell lab'' says Richard Corbisiero the board's chairman who met with Cornell officials for five hours one day last week. ''But in all fairness to them I have to point out that they test about 230000 samples of blood and urine each year and this is the first time anything like this has happened. I think that speaks for itself.'' For his part Dr. George Maylin the lab's director continues to stand by the finding that Lashkari was drugged but says that the irregularities would have made a legal defense impossible. (Lashkari's owner and trainer dropped civil suits against the board when the disqualification was overturned last month.) ''We always have other laboratories confirm our findings'' Maylin says ''and this was the first time we have had a problem. In this case a laboratory technician has admitted that he post-dated data so there is question now about the rest of the work he did on this sample.''

 5101,  1989, a, ''We're very glad to see George Washington in such good form'' said Mitsuko Suzuki of Japan who traveled to New York City with four members of her family for the festivities. Closing the CycleYesterday's ceremony capped a series of observances of the nation's founding that included the celebration of American independence in 1976 and the 1987 salute to the Constitution. And the inaugural re-enactment came after a weekend of festivities that brought a flotilla of tall ships into New York Harbor and sent fireworks flashing over lower Manhattan on Saturday. In the foggy night sky the fireworks had a washed-out look but the crowd oohed and aahed as rosettes bloomed above New York harbor and cannon-like booms echoed back and forth.After the first inauguration 200 years ago Dr. W. W. Buchanan a godson of Washington wrote that there was ''a police office and watch-house'' at Broad and Wall Streets and he watched the inauguration from there. That station house is long gone but the police were on hand yesterday. More than 4500 officers were stationed throughout lower Manhattan and most of the area was sealed off to private cars for most of the weekend.Yesterday's events began where Washington began his day 200 years ago at St. Paul's Chapel between Fulton and Vesey Streets. Two hundred years ago its steeple made it one of the tallest buildings in Manhattan; now it is dwarfed by the World Trade Center and almost everything else nearby. But inside the sanctuary with its clear glass windows and covered altar the pew that George Washington used on his inauguration day is still there.For yesterday's ''Service of Thanksgiving'' the church was filled with more than 300 dignitaries including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a Democrat of New York. He arrived as the deep ancient bells in the church tower tolled. A Hymn Is ReprisedMayor Edward I. Koch was already inside as were Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a fellow Democrat; Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato a New York Republican; Senator Frank Lautenberg a New Jersey Democrat and the actress Helen Hayes.Mr. Bush's heavily-guarded motorcade glided to a stop under a tent outside the chapel and the President and Mrs. Bush went inside where bright television lights and video cameras were nestled between the chapel's ornate white columns. There was no sermon only readings and prayers including one by the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr. the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Mr. Moore greeted the Bushes and noted that he had once worked on a ''civil rights program in Texas'' with them.

After graduatingMs. Wheeler was interviewed by 19 investment banks but decided to start her fantasy business instead.Eleven months ago she opened the Kimberly Gallery in the SoHo section of Manhattan which she says is New York's only art gallery for children. "I specialize in alternative art forms for children as well as in children's book illustrations" she said.The gallery carries two lines of children's furniture. Each piece of Tracey Belfatto's multi-functional furniture incorporates a blackboard and an abacus. Rob Johnson's line is high-tech: all glass and black steel. "It's very much for the SoHo baby" Ms. Wheeler said.There are some wonderful small items including at near right an early 1900's illustration by Arthur Rackham ($140) and at far right a hand-painted giraffe ($130) and a rabbit clock ($120).

Future Republican presidents will have to decide as Team Obama has how to buck or accommodate that trend.Fox News has attracted the most attention because of its “fair and balanced” challenge to its competitors and its success. But the audiences of its competitors have tilted sharply in the other direction.

 4615,  1992, a, The Missing 'Falsettos'The Broadway season ended this week on a slightly sour note for "Falsettos" despite the many positive reviews it received. It was the last musical to open by Wednesday the cutoff date for Tony Award eligibility but neither Channel 5's 10 P.M. news nor Channel 4's 11 P.M. news carried reviews by their respective critics Stewart Klein and Pia Lindstrom. "Falsettos" combines two one-act musicals about gay life in the early 1980's -- "March of the Falsettos" and "Falsettoland" by William Finn and James Lapine -- that were produced separately Off Broadway.So why does it matter that these two news programs looked the other way? For the Broadway theater industry locked in a constant struggle with local stations about lack of coverage it means a lot. Broadway has been lucky these last six weeks with its anomalous surplus of Hollywood stars. But without Glenn Close or Jessica Lange to tantalize local news directors Broadway shows have been increasingly ignored in the last year. "Falsettos" has no stars."It's a great disappointment to us that a major network like NBC has arbitrarily decided not to support a new American musical by refusing to review our show" say Barry and Fran Weissler the show's producers. "It is outrageous that this is a decision that not only affects our show but could affect our entire industry in the coming seasons."Ms. Lindstrom says: "We have had a policy over the last year not to cover every Broadway show. What I review is my decision in collaboration with the executive producer who will look at a list of openings and ask 'What can you eliminate here?' If a show is a revival doesn't have stars or has a limited appeal then we don't do it. As a news organization it is our right to decide what to cover."

 5573,  1986, a, JACKEE HARRY a star of the television comedy series ''227'' jokingly describes her cabaret act as ''New York girl makes good goes to Hollywood and goes crazy.'' The remark is typical of the blunt sassy humor that runs through her show which plays at Sweetwater's (170 Amsterdam Avenue at 67th Street) through May 3.Among other comic bits Miss Harry recalls her experiences as a would-be pedicurist and does an amusing send-up of a Hispanic fortune teller giving impromptu readings between choruses of Stevie Wonder's ''Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing.''More confident as a comedienne than as a vocalist Miss Harry is musically comfortable singing light brassy novelties like ''Material Girl'' and ''Freeway of Love.'' The bump-and-grind pop-soul version of Stephen Sondheim's ''Putting It Together'' that opens her show is an amusing travesty. Dramatic ballads however exceed her technical reach. Belting a medley of ''A House Is Not a Home'' and ''Who Can I Turn To?'' at Tuesday's late show Miss Harry was frequently flat. Her version of Laura Nyro's ''Buy and Sell'' lacked the aura of smouldering angst that the song demands and she failed to give ''I Am Changing'' from ''Dreamgirls'' a coherent dramatic shape.

 5864,  1984, a, Moreover there is something about the Sumerians' having been the first people to have written about love and death fear and jealousy science and technology the stars weather marriage war and countless other human interests that seems to have lent this ancient people great charm as well as historical importance.To a Sumerologist the fact that few scholars can actually read Sumerian (only 750 copies of the first volume of the dictionary have been printed at $40 each) is the world's bad luck rather than a sign of the limited appeal of their field.Superficially said Prof. Samuel Noah Kramer the 87-year-old dean of Sumerian literary studies and a consultant to the dictionary staff a project like the Sumerian dictionary which has five other editors besides Dr. Sjoberg and which has been given grants of more than $1 million since it began in 1976 is an elitist enterprise.But Dr. Kramer said ''In the long run it will be something that is of significance for everyone.'' Knowledge of Sumerian literature he suggested could be useful to a most anti-elitist view of human history. ''You can look up all this stuff about slavery about the poor about the oppressed about oligarchies.''Prof. Erle Leichty an Assyriaologist is the dictionary's co-editor. The other editors are Hermann Behrens Barry L. Eichler Margaret W. Green and Darlene M. Loding.The University of Pennsylvania has been a center of ancient Mesopotamian studies for a century. The first American archeological expedition to the area was organized in 1887. That expedition led to the first excavations of the holy Sumerian city of Nippur in 1888 and in the decades that followed archeologists from the university museum brought home some 30000 clay tablets that are still being studied.More recently a succession of Iraqi governments has sometimes made it difficult for American scholars to pursue their Mesopotamian researches on the scene. But several scholars today expressed cautious optimism that it may be easier to visit Iraq now that the United States and Iraq have resumed diplomatic relations which were severed in 1967.

 6033,  1978, a, BALDNESS undoubtedly contributed to the success of actors Yul Brynner and Telly Savalas and the high fashion model Pat Evans. But somehow the glamour of their gleaming pates never caught on with the average man or woman. While many are content merely to lament the gradual loss of their straight or curly locks others squander millions of hard‐earned dollars in a frantic and fruitless search for ways to halt the inexorable passing of hair follicles.Short of castration there is currently no safe and effective way to prevent or cure the most common kind of baldness that afflicts mankind. It is programmed by the genes and triggered by hormones that few would part with. No lotion or drug no amount of massaging oiling brushing or washing vitamins or minerals or protein supplements can halt or reverse the loss of hair as we get older.But there are various ways now to camouflage hereditary baldness as well as to prevent or correct other causes of hair loss. You can avoid unnecessary damage to your hair and you should avoid unscrupulous “hair specialists” (trichologists) who may promise you a Sampson mane but only succeed in emptying your pocket. The facts'that follow were derived mainly from two no-nonsense books about hair and its care.'One “The AMA Book of Skin and Hair Care” (Lippincott 1976 $9.95) was edited by Linda Allen Schoen in Consultation with the American Medical Association's Committee on Cutaneous Health and Cosmetics. The second “All About Hair” (Wallingford Press 1978 $10) was written by Dr. Herbert S. Feinberg a New Jersey dermatologist who specializes in hair transplantation.First it helps to know some basic facts about hair and how it grows. Normal hair growth depends on certain vitamins and minerals and aeequate protein in the diet. But this does not mean that extra amounts of these substances can halt or reverse hair Incc

Love’s round included a hole-in-one at the par-3 fifth.Love the 2012 U.S. Ryder Cup captain equaled the mark set by nine players including Graeme McDowell and Rory Sabbatini in 2011. The last time Love scored lower than 64 was during the third round of the 2005 Bob Hope Classic.“I’ve been hitting the ball real well” Love said “and a lot of tournaments last year I just didn’t get off to a good start. I had a lot of even par the first day or 1-over and just get behind the 8-ball. So I’m just glad to be off to a good start.”Love’s ace the fifth of his PGA Tour career came with a 5-iron from 195 yards.“It hit I don’t know three or four feet short and I don’t know if it bounced once or twice but went right in” Love said. He added: “That was a big boost. I obviously hit a good shot but you’re lucky when they go in.”Love had seven sub-70 rounds in 22 starts in 2011. In his first three starts this year he made one cut tying for 20th at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.“I did some work with my short game and putting and things between Pebble and now to get ready for here” Love said. “I worked on iron shots because you’ve got to hit good iron shots on par 3s to survive this golf course so it paid off today. Yeah it’s fun to break tie the course record and it’s fun to shoot low scores.”

 1466,  2010, a, Sony Pictures Entertainment which last year cut 250 jobs or about 3.5 percent of its workers said it was a planning a new round of job reductions that could total an additional 6.5 percent of its global workforce.The new cuts were disclosed in a message to employees from Michael Lynton the company’s chairman and Amy Pascal its co-chairwoman on Monday. The cuts are expected to total an additional 450 out of about 6800 employees according to an executive who was briefed on the situation but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of studio policy.In addition about 100 jobs that are now unfilled will be eliminated the executive said. Most employees whose jobs will be cut are to be notified in March.In their letter to employees Mr. Lynton and Ms. Pascal said the cuts would be spread across the studio’s divisions though most would be in its home entertainment and information technology operations. A steady decline in DVD revenue has forced Hollywood studios to cut staff and look for ways to consolidate operations.“The business is going through a rough period of trial and transition” said the two executives whose statement pointed to the growth of piracy and the effect of social media on film viewing as factors challenging studios.“We have an obligation to take the steps necessary to get through it” they said.

 2260,  2006, a, “After terrible suffering and great travails King Jamshid climbed up to Zabulistan.”This fairy tale line comes from an 11th-century cycle of epic poetry that is as vital to Persian civilization as Homer’s poetry is to Greece. What startled me when I first read it was the place name repeated again and again: not some great city in the Iranian heartlands like Babylon but Zabulistan – the tract of desolate frontier that stretches north and east from Kandahar.The “Shahnameh” cycle celebrates a dynasty of mythic heroes whose fiefdom is Zabulistan and whose exploits glorified the kingdom of Iran and protected it from its northern enemies. But the poetry is studded with examples of the champions’ testy independence even when performing great feats in the service of their kings. In one of the most celebrated episodes Rustam the chief hero kills the crown prince in battle rather than be carried to court in fetters.Through such symbolism the poems reflect the legendary – and to a large degree real – unconquerability of the region that is now southern and eastern Afghanistan.Some 500 years before the “Shanameh” was written the Muslim conquests transformed the eastern Mediterranean region – and much of the world – forever after. The Arab tribesmen who burst forth from their desert on camels armed with little more than the egalitarian precepts of their new religion swept away two empires almost toppled a third and founded a polity that reached from Spain to the borders of India. But they could not reduce Zabulistan. Chronicles from the period detail fierce fighting on the frontier between the Muslim ghazis and the pagan subjects of Zabulistan. To this day Afghans – whose name to some is now synonymous with inflexible adherence to conservative Islam – are proud of their forefathers’ resistance to the companions of the Prophet Muhammad.Eventually (in the mid-900’s) a local fellow – a brigand and son of a coppersmith from a village 200 miles west of Kandahar – opened Zabulistan to Islam. At a victory feast one night the court poet began singing his praises in Arabic as usual. “Why should I have to listen to this stuff I can’t even understand?” the conqueror supposedly interrupted ordering up verses in his native Persian which until then had been only a vernacular.This helped launch another kind of revolution: a cultural revolution which led to the composition of the “Shahnameh.” It was an explosion of creativity in literature art and architecture in science manners thought and style that conquered the Arab Muslim conquerors of the Iranian plateau and spread eastward over the next half-millennium to the borders of China. This cultural efflorescence defines Afghanistan’s character as surely as the country’s fierce adoption of the religion of Islam does.Although Afghanistan almost brought the Muslim conquests to a standstill; although it maintained in the 19th century a difficult independence from both Russia and imperial Britain; and although a century later it staved off the Soviet Red Army the country has been conquered. Indeed devastating earth-gutting conquest – as much as Afghanistan’s legendary independence – defines the country’s character too.The most traumatic defeat came in the first quarter of the 13th century at the hands of Genghis Khan and his Mongols who laid waste to great swaths of two continents. Again Afghanistan almost held them off. A prince named Jalal ad-Din whose father had five years earlier bequeathed him its lands did what no other leader in those parts had dared. He attacked the Mongols. And in a mighty battle north of Kabul he beat them. But then that legendary Afghan unruliness intruded: the two wings of the prince’s multiethnic army fought over the division of spoils and the honor that went with them and half the troops deserted. Jalal ad-Din retreated to the Indus River where the Mongols caught up with him and destroyed what was left of his army. Then they overran the future Afghanistan.Genghis Khan’s imitator Tamerlane repeated the process a century and a half later tearing up the carefully irrigated breadbasket west of Kandahar which to this day remains mostly desert. Yet once again Persian culture conquered its conquerors. Tamerlane’s son established his capital in Herat (now on Afghanistan’s western border) where there soon flourished an unparalleled school of Persian painting whose artists frequently illustrated the “Shahnameh” cycle.This dogged determination to rise again from the ashes this stubborn cleaving to life and beauty and imagination gives me hope for Afghanistan even now.Through each tumultuous epoch the city of Kandahar marked the frontier – between Islam and paganism and between the Iranian plateau and the Indian subcontinent. Kandahar has been the cusp. You can see this place as an implacable barrier or you can see it as the place where the barrier is pierced a valve that channels a flow of people ideas merchandise and wisdom. That is the role I would choose for Kandahar and Afghanistan.

 107,  2019, a, “Manet and Modern Beauty” owes a lot to feminist scholarship on the artist over the last 30 years and even the curators’ choice of walls of muted rose and dusky lilac signals their embrace of the “feminine” epithet that opponents of the late work once hurled. But there have always been many Manets and even the later tenderer Manet coexists with an artist of deep political engagement and historical sweep. The glaring absences in this exhibition — even more than the “Bar” — are Manet’s 1881 portrait of the exiled Communard Henri Rochefort as well as his two late great seascapes both titled “Rochefort’s Escape” and painted in 1880-81. As Mr. Allan writes in the catalog Manet’s last years coincided with “an epochal political shift leftward” in France and these maritime paintings with a political prisoner form the last act in Manet’s long interweaving of historical painterly styles and current events.I suspect those works are not here so as to leave the last word to “Jeanne” the Getty’s prize who also appears on the catalog’s cover and on posters all over Chicago. May the gods of French painting forgive me but “Jeanne” is a banal and overly refined picture and its marriage of fashion and foliage tips exhibits a vulgarity wholly unlike the cool careful “In the Conservatory.” The curators make hay from the fact that in 1882 visitors and critics at the Salon preferred the bright pleasant “Jeanne” to the darker stranger “Bar.” But I’m not sure why the same contemporary critics who slimed “Olympia” now get to have the definitive word on which Manets matter most.I made three passes of “Manet and Modern Beauty” and between the second and third I went upstairs to see the Art Institute’s most prized Manet: the pancake-flat “Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers” which survived the outraged crowds of the 1865 Salon. Its blank background and disdain for illusion are miles away from the floral profusion of “Jeanne.” And I tried to shake my conviction that “Jesus Mocked” — a masterpiece of candor so proud to be a two-dimensional slab of oil and canvas — counts for more than the fashionable scenes below.Why do I value this early Manet so much more? It is only because I think art has a higher vocation than delivering joy?Or is it because poor modern boy that I am I have been trained by more than a century of artists and writers to be suspicious of beauty — that ruse that luxury that feminine thing? The received history of modern Western painting over which Manet looms like our great bourgeois Allfather can feel like a succession of attacks on beauty by generations of arrogant men each more certain than the last that their art would at last redeem an ugly society. But Manet knew that there is as much rebellion and insight in a dress a bouquet or even a pile of strawberries if he could see past their surfaces to the richness within. That is another path to modernity grounded in what his dear friend Baudelaire in “The Painting of Modern Life” called “beauty fashion and happiness.”Manet and Modern BeautyThrough Sept. 8 at the Art Institute of Chicago; artic.edu.

 2543,  2004, a, HIGHLIGHTSNAGANO TO MONTREAL? -- Kent Nagano left is set to succeed Charles Dutoit as music director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra a report in Le Devoir a Montreal newspaper said. The appointment of Mr. Nagano the artistic director and principal conductor of the Deutsches Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin principal conductor of the Los Angeles Opera music director of the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra in California since 1978 and designated successor in 2006 to Zubin Mehta as music director of the Bavarian State Opera would begin with the 2006-7 season. The Montreal Symphony would not comment on the report but said it would announce a successor to Mr. Dutoit this month. The post of music director of the Montreal Symphony has been vacant since spring 2002 when Mr. Dutoit who had held the position for 25 years resigned abruptly after the Quebec Musicians Guild issued an open letter likening the musicians under him to battered spouses who ''have quietly endured years of verbal and psychological abuse and now want it to stop.''KNIGHTHOOD FOR PERAHIA -- The American pianist Murray Perahia is to be made an honorary knight commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony in London next Monday.

 4376,  1994, a, After meeting with Charles Oakley and his representatives on Thursday Dave Checketts the Knicks' president remains hopeful that Oakley will report to training camp starting Friday.Checketts plans to meet with Oakley's representatives again before camp. Oakley unhappy that he is locked into a contract with four years remaining that will pay him $2.2 million this season has threatened not to report. Oakley is seeking an extension at the end of his current deal a one-year balloon payment in the neighborhood of $10 million. The Knicks reportedly offered the forward a one-year $4 million extension months ago that Oakley rejected. But while the two sides have not come to terms Checketts said his meeting with Oakley was a positive step.I think I understand where Charles is coming from" Checketts said. "I'm concerned about his situation just like I'm concerned about anything that comes up. Charles has been respectful and no one has told me yet that he's definitely not coming to camp."Asked how upsetting it would be if Oakley a co-captain did not report Checketts said: "I'm not going to speculate on that at this point. Obviously Charles Oakley is a very very important part of our team."
 3609,  1998, a, WHILE THE frozen streets here glistened with new-fallen snow the entrances to galleries and museums were aglitter with the same curvilinear glass vase filled with tulips. More than a harbinger of spring the recurring vase evoked the spirit of its designer Alvar Aalto whose centenary this year is the cause for the festive mood in this capital city.Though Aalto is the best known internationally he was only one of many Finnish designers and architects whose works defined this country's Modernist sensibility. Streamlined practical and durable these designs are familiar in homes and offices all over the world. In addition to the Aalto vase there are the ergonomically perfect Fiskars scissors the Everyboy striped shirt made by Marimekko and the red enamel coffeepot designed by Antti Nurmesniemi.The centerpiece of the recent events here is the reopening after a major interior renovation of the Museum of Art and Design along with a new permanent display that chronicles the history of Finnish modern design. Situated in a Gothic-revival school building the museum which opened in 1873 is the oldest in Scandinavia devoted to design. Its stores have grown rich enough not only to fill its own sleek showcases but also to make generous loans to the Bard Graduate Center in New York for its current exhibition ''Finnish Design: Utopian Ideals and Everyday Realities 1930 to 1997.'' This show of 144 works was organized by Marianne Aav curator of the Finnish museum and her counterpart at Bard Nina Stritzler-Levine.To appreciate the evolution of Finnish design one has to understand the history of the country. From the 12th century on Finland was under the dominion of Sweden until it was conquered by Russia in 1809. Finnish architecture began to flourish under the czars and with its pale-ocher columned buildings Helsinki took on the neo-classical style that made it the equal of St. Petersburg. When Finland became independent after the Russian Revolution in 1917 its designers already leaders at international expositions turned from a romantic tradition and used their work to assert a new identity. And in time Finland tied its economic future to a strong domestic industry in the design of modern products.

 4483,  1993, a, There was so much talking between Ray Mercer and Jesse Ferguson in their Feb. 6 bout at Madison Square Garden that George Foreman Larry Merchant and Jim Lampley the HBO announcers began to joke about the jawing.Foreman Merchant and Lampley were commenting on the fight in a warmup that was not for general broadcast. At one point after Mercer had again spoken to Ferguson during a clinch Foreman quipped "I think he just made him an offer to quit."That is apparently what a grand jury believed too. Mercer 32 years old was indicted on a sports bribery charge arrested in Indianapolis on Sunday night and arraigned on the felony charge Tuesday in Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty.District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau contended that Mercer could be heard "repeatedly" on the tapes offering Ferguson a bribe to throw the fight. The district attorney said that Mercer had mentioned $100000. Mercer who lost the 10-round fight had been guaranteed a title shot against Bowe worth at least $1.5 million if he were to defeat Ferguson.

 3586,  1998, a, To the Editor: Apropos of ''A Free Museum Is Harder to Find'' (Dec. 28) my wife and I have known that United States citizens are not eligible for Italy's free entry for over-65's since we first encountered the policy in 1988. However we have occasionally gotten the reduction mostly by keeping our mouths shut or sometimes by muttering ''vecchio'' (''aged'') or ''I speak English'' (British subjects get the discount).On reading Betsy Wade's article I thought immediately of the time we visited the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. The young woman behind the desk could see us coming and I could see her reach for a pad of ''old folks'' tickets and get ready to stamp them before we reached the desk. She stamped one and had her hand raised to stamp the second when my wife said (in rather too-loud Brooklyn English) ''How did she know we're old?'' The hand paused a scowl appeared a combination sigh-hiss emerged and the stamp banged down on the second pass. We rapidly fled to the interior.Actually as noted in the article the free-entry rule applies only to Italian state museums. Others set their own rules. Probably the strangest was at the Museo Barracco di Scultura Antica in Rome. There we had to show our passports sign affidavits and write an entry in a log book before being granted free admission as senior citizens.ALAN STEWARTBath Me.
 3700,  1998, a, Instead companies with exposure to Asia and Russia -- like financial institutions -- or those that are heavily dependent on exports for earnings are perceived to be at the most risk in the near future and a risky partner for a potential merger.In addition merger activity among high-technology companies could fall off sharply as a direct result of the market decline. Internet stock prices in particular were in a free fall yesterday making it difficult for bankers and executives alike to figure out what price an acquired company should command.''There has been a chilling effect'' said Gene Sykes co-head of the high-technology group at Goldman Sachs & Company. ''Some deals won't get done for two weeks maybe a month. No one really knows.''But while Wall Street watchers are cautious about the future there is little concern that deals already struck this year will unravel. A market downturn itself is not enough to halt a transaction especially in stock-for-stock deals where the prices of both company's stock have fallen in tandem.The real deal-killers will be companies that either miss earnings or run into trouble abroad.Still the market has been rife the last two weeks with rumors about what deal will be the next to be scrapped or renegotiated like the recent renegotiation of the merger between Tellabs and Ciena. Early last week for instance rumors cropped up that the Travelers Group and Citicorp merger was being renegotiated something company executives said was untrue.

 3553,  1999, a, So the corporate digs need spiffing up and you think some original art sure would be nice over the reception desk or in the conference room. True you could get some by-the-numbers original oils or an old master print -- but you want something with a bit more class.Still at today's art prices? Forget it.Ian Peck has heard that cry and today he plans to start a Web site fineartlease.com that as its name implies leases original artwork.The good stuff includes the likes of N. C. Wyeth Chagall Hockney. Browse the site's gallery; if a painting grabs your fancy it can be had for as little as three months or as much as 10 years -- at say roughly $1400 a month for a painting valued at $75000.In a world where so much is borrowed why should art be any different? Think of the tax deduction on those lease payments -- starting at 15 percent of the painting's value a year. Mr. Peck cites the tax benefit as a big selling point.

The Justice Department meanwhile has been pressing its own suit against the company.The executives' letter which was sent to Joel Klein assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division contends that delaying the operating system would affect the more than two million programmers who write software for Windows-based computers as well as an equal number who work in the computer services industry. The executives said that a delay would also injure the makers of hardware and peripheral products.
 1585,  2010, a, For Republican candidates the House speaker Nancy Pelosi is a favorite target these days — the San Francisco liberal and leader of the Democratic incumbents that the insurgent resurgent G.O.P. challengers want to oust. But as vilified as she may be at times Ms. Pelosi is planning an aggressive itinerary to raise money for individual Democratic candidates and for her party as whole in the closing weeks of the campaign.This weekend Ms. Pelosi will speak at fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in New York and Los Angeles according to her office. She will then attend committee fund-raising dinners with President Obama on Oct. 11 in Coral Gables Fla. and on Oct. 23 in Minneapolis and another with the first lady Michelle Obama in San Francisco on Oct. 25.In addition she will visit a local manufacturer in San Francisco on Wednesday to talk about the Democrats’ “Make it in America” agenda and she will address the United Steel Workers’ “Women of Steel” conference in Pittsburgh on Oct. 18. All in all the news bulletin said Ms. Pelosi will visit eight states for 25 fund-raising events with 21 Democratic lawmakers between now and the Nov. 2 election.Ms. Pelosi’s office said it was not releasing details about her other destinations in keeping with longstanding security procedures and noting that other events could be added to her schedule. But given that five of the eight states are New York California Florida Pennsylvania and Minnesota it seemed likely that Ms. Pelosi would be making repeat visits to Democratic strongholds and steer clear of regions where she could cause political problems for Democratic candidates.
 4927,  1990, a, To the Editor:John Russell's tribute to Tom Armstrong's tenure as director of the Whitney Museum of American Art is well founded [''Adding Up the Costs of Changes at the Top'' March 18] . Nevertheless he should not have been shocked by Mr. Armstrong's recent dismissal. It's an occupational hazard.A museum with contemporary focus - like the Whitney - whose trustees are committed largely to patronage of living artists cannot be expected to demonstrate policy based in tradition and stability. These contemporary patron-trustees tend to make decisions in a businessman's vacuum unlike the ''collecteur-amateurs'' of earlier times.A practical truth may be that a museum director's job security varies directly with the average age of the works collected or exhibited by the museum. Although disturbing news for contemporary-museum officers this equation should give comfort to those working at institutions solidly bound to the art of previous centuries.SHELDON PECKNewton Mass.

 826,  2014, a, ZIMMERMAN--Kenneth.Kenneth "Kenny" Zimmerman son of Jerome and Renee Zimmerman beloved Husband Father and Grandfather passed away June 25 2014 at his home in Edgewater New Jersey. Born in Brooklyn New York Zimmerman attended Poly Prep High School and then graduated from The University of Miami in 1972. Shortly thereafter he started Kenar Enterprises with Murray Levy. In the early 90's Zimmerman was one of the first and one of the strongest leaders in philanthropic efforts in the Fashion Industry. He used his company's largest advertising vehicle the billboard at One Times Square under the Sony TV screen for 10 years. It was there that the world could see his provocative advertisements of global social issues such as AIDS Elisabeth Glaser's Pediatric AIDS Foundation and Evelyn Lauder's Breast Cancer Research Foundation. His well-known supermodels Linda Evangelista Helena Christensen Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer were the cause of many traffic jams in Times Square. One of his most celebrated campaigns featured an advertisement shot in Sicily with Linda Evangelista and seven Sicilian women dressed in black; limited editions of the photograph were sold with proceeds going to an AIDS education group. The International Center for Photography included it as one of the '20 most important fashion photographs" ever. Kenar opened stores world-wide but in 1994 the New York flagship on Madison Avenue opened to much fan-fare as Mrs. Evelyn Lauder Mayor Giuliani Elizabeth Hurley Linda Evangelista and Mr. Zimmerman cut the huge Pink Ribbon dedicating a portion of Kenar's sales that October for Breast Cancer Awareness month to BCRF. After selling the brand Kenar to the Pegasus Fund Kenny purchased other brands that were in bankruptcy and rebuilt them. Some of these brands were Schrader St. Gillian A.J. Bari Freeway In Transit and Hero Group (Black Tie by Oleg Cassini). In 1999 Kenny formed a new venture Emma Black and Zola Evening producing sportswear and evening wear for major department stores around the world. Never satisfied with all of his accomplishments in 2003 Kenny developed Calvin Klein Outerwear a newly acquired license by Calvin Klein Corporation. He was proud to be able to support many charities and causes. Another project dear to his heart was working with The Partnership for the Homeless along with restaurants across the city helping to feed those less fortunate. He was on the Board of The Jack Martin Fund at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Board of Directors at the JCC on the Palisades. He was also on the Advisory Board of Babies Hospital at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Kenny's family was more important than any of his companies or positions. Arlene Zimmerman his beloved wife of 42 years; his proud loving children Nicole Zachary and Ryan Zimmerman; his grandchildren Ethan and Jordan Zimmerman; and his sister Leslie Daspin survive him. His eldest son Matthew predeceased him in 2012.

 2405,  2005, a, For several years now Thomas L. Friedman has balanced two major subjects: the Middle East and globalization. The Middle East with the specter of civilizational clashes and apocalyptic terrorism has been the bad news. Globalization promising international prosperity and harmony has been the good. Yet as Friedman shows in his new book "The World Is Flat" this good news may not be all that good at least for those who keep an eye on America's place in the world. Friedman presents a passel of statistics showing that we are falling badly behind in the crucial areas of science and technology.There is probably no one more aware of these trends than Fareed Zakaria the editor of Newsweek International and author of the best-selling book "The Future of Freedom." In his review of Friedman's book (Page 10) Zakaria cites a passage in which Friedman stands outside an outsourcing company in Bangalore and watches "wave after wave" of young Indian techies passing by all eager all prepared to participate in the new global economy. Meanwhile as Friedman tells us America ranked third in the world in the number of science degrees awarded to 18-to-24-year-olds three decades ago. Today it ranks 17th.On the back page Randy Cohen who writes the Ethicist column for The Times Magazine makes an unusual appeal to readers: Cohen is putting together with the help of the graphic artist Nigel Holmes a literary map of Manhattan for the Book Review -- not of authors' homes and haunts but those of their fictional characters: from the Plaza where not only Eloise but Woody Allen's Emma Bovary lives (and Jay Gatsby visits) to St. George's Church in Stuyvesant Square where Mary McCarthy's novel "The Group" begins.

 347,  2017, a, INTERNATIONALAn article on Friday about reaction to President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord attributed a quotation incorrectly. It was Lavanya Rajamani a professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi — not her colleague Navroz K. Dubash — who said “Stating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling. The Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.” The article also referred incorrectly to comments by President Emmanuel Macron of France. In criticizing Mr. Trump’s decision Mr. Macron spoke in French before switching to English not the other way around.NEW YORKAn article last Saturday about parking permits in New York City misstated the number of placards given to city employees as well as the total number of people employed by the city and the percentage of total placards held by city workers. About 114600 of the placards were given to city employees not 160500. As of March there were 317944 full-time city employees not 293296 meaning that less than a third of all city employees have parking permits not more than half.SPORTSA headline on Thursday with an article about the Yankees’ Aaron Judge referred incorrectly to his position in voting for the All-Star Game.

 2423,  2005, a, Correction AppendedWhether or not it contributes to global warming carbon dioxide is turning the oceans acidic Britain's leading scientific organization warned yesterday.In a report by a panel of scientists the organization the Royal Society said the growing acidity would be very likely to harm coral reefs and other marine life by the end of the century."I think there are very serious issues to be addressed" the panel's chairman Dr. John Raven of the University of Dundee in Scotland said in an interview. "It will affect all organisms that have skeletons shells hard bits that are made of calcium carbonate."The 60-page report was timed to influence next week's Group of 8 economic summit meeting. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain president of the group this year has been calling for strong action to limit climate change.
 2662,  2004, a, "Boxing is broken no doubt about it" Burnett said by telephone last week. "But if I'm right and based on my other unscripted dramas I can take 16 young men and each of them will leave the contest way ahead of where they came in in terms of their value to themselves and to us. We know that marketing is the key to their economic success."Despite the wall of silence some results have leaked and many of the boxers' names are known: Sergio Mora (who has a 12-0 record) Peter Manfredo Jr. (21-0) Jesse Lee Brinkley (23-1-0) and Ishe Smith (14-0).Mark L. Tuft a lawyer in San Francisco who specializes in the media said there was no problem in a person agreeing to waive what would be grounds for defamation or invasion-of-privacy claims. "But what are the outer reaches of this?" he said. "I suppose there is a line beyond which it becomes unconscionable."Burnett defended his practices and suggested that if some of his famous alumni like Richard Hatch of "Survivor" and Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth of "The Apprentice" were willing to suspend their civil rights for money and fame so should the boxers. He said that the boxers had representatives read the contracts with oversight by the California State Athletic Commission."You can't value the boxers' rights over Richard's or Omarosa's" Burnett said. "Based on the state of boxing and the value of these men all of whom came in disenfranchised pushed aside and lied to we've kept our word and gave them a fair chance."The boxers were unavailable for comment.The California commission has no purview over the participant deals and did not examine them said Dean Lohuis the interim executive officer of the agency. "Our job is to look out for the safety of the fighters and to be sure they were ready" he said adding that the commission kept strict oversight of the bouts.The agreement by the boxers to abide by reality TV rules that do not exist in their normal lives would be useless to Burnett if viewers knew the results of the bouts which have been taped except for the final; it will be carried live in April from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
 291,  2017, a, It was going to happen to someone and it did. Nearly everything that could go wrong in a live public broadcast television appearance went wrong for Mariah Carey in her three-song just-before-midnight performance on ABC’s “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest” in Times Square. At first it was pretty standard fare: She posed framed by feathers as a glittering pop princess through a pristine apparently lip-synced “Auld Lang Syne.”But then “Emotions” started and she said as the music played her monitors weren’t working. (Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International the longtime audio company for Times Square on New Year’s Eve disputed her complaints: “There were zero technical malfunctions” he wrote in an email to The New York Times. “Every monitor and in-ear device worked perfectly.”) Beyond a handful of phrases Ms. Carey didn’t attempt to sing her lead vocals. Meanwhile both speaking and singing her voice was considerably lower huskier and scratchier than it had been during “Auld Lang Syne.”“I’m trying to be a good sport here” she said as the backing track to “Emotions” played on. “Let the audience sing” she urged and she cued one of her dancers to grab her in a lift. She kept on smiling and strutting in her high heels; she held her microphone toward the crowd. When the song ended she declared “That was” — she paused to choose a valid but positive adjective — “amazing.”Then with a skirt added to her outfit and still smiling she performed her 2005 hit “We Belong Together” at times holding the microphone far from her mouth or calling out “Happy New Year!” as the impeccable lead vocals continued: more proof of lip-syncing. “It just don’t get any better” she quipped husky-voiced again. And the segment was over.

 722,  2015, a, In the 1950s some jazz musicians believed they couldn’t get that Charlie Parker “happy-sad feeling without using drugs.” So says a friend of the saxophonist Frank Morgan in “Sound of Redemption” a documentary that revels in the happy despite some seriously sad events.Mr. Morgan was born into music. His father was a professional musician who used to play his guitar while pressing it against the belly of his pregnant wife and later played by his son’s crib. Mr. Morgan was an accomplished saxophonist by the time he was a teenager; it’s said that when he performed with Billie Holiday his music made her cry.His renown grew as did an addiction to heroin. His drug habit was soon financed by crime and for some 30 years he was in and out of prison. After his last stint he was released and went on to record some of his finest work.The film directed by N.C. Heikin traces Mr. Morgan’s career with beautiful black-and-white photographs and newsreels. Those scenes are intertwined with segments from a 2012 tribute concert at San Quentin prison in California five years after his death.

 5891,  1983, a, TO French cooks garnishes and decorations have always been important. They can take many forms from a simple sprig of parsley or watercress to an ice sculpture or a pastry that is molded into an architectural shape and baked.Recently I prepared a recipe given to me by a friend Noelle Morris. The dish was breasts of chicken sauteed with mushrooms and given a garnish of cooked artichoke bottoms filled with a puree of sweet red peppers. Although it can be made in an hour I don't think of it as a dish for a casual meal. It is quite festive and worth fixing for a special occasion. The basic dish is excellent and the artichoke garnish gives it a special style.The preparation entails sauteing boneless chicken breasts in butter until cooked through. They are served on a bed of noodles with a white wine and mushroom cream sauce. When the garnish is added the contrasts both in the colors - the green of the artichokes and the red puree of peppers - and in the flavors will make your guests sit up in admiration. Chicken Noelle (Chicken breasts with artichokes) 8 boneless skinless chicken breast halves Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 2 red sweet peppers about 3/4 pound 4 tablespoons butter 1/2 pound mushrooms thinly sliced about 3 cups 2 tablespoons chopped shallots 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 pound medium egg noodles 2 quarts boiling water 4 buttered artichoke bottoms (see recipe) 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.1. Sprinkle pieces of breast meat with salt and pepper and set aside.2. Cut away the core of each pepper. Cut peppers lengthwise into quarters; discard inner veins and seeds. Put pieces of pepper in a saucepan with water to cover and bring to a boil. Simmer about eight minutes. Drain. In a processor or electric blender blend the pepper to a fine puree. Pour puree into a small skillet and cook about five minutes. Add one tablespoon of butter.
 1465,  2010, a, Sarah Palin the former Alaska governor has waded into another Republican primary this time endorsing Rand Paul’s Kentucky Senate campaign.In a statement released Monday Ms. Palin said she was “proud to support great grassroots candidates like Dr. Paul” an ophthalmologist and son of Representative Ron Paul the Texas Republican and 2008 presidential candidate.“While there are issues we disagree on he and I are both in agreement that it’s time to shake up the status quo in Washington and stand up for common sense ideas” Ms. Palin added.For his part Dr. Paul on Monday touted the leadership of Ms. Palin who is scheduled to give the keynote address at the National Tea Party Convention this week. “I will strive to capitalize on the support of Governor Palin and so many others to go to Washington and fight for liberty and limited government” said Dr. Paul himself a favorite among Tea Party activists.Dr. Paul is locked in a primary battle with Trey Grayson Kentucky’s secretary of state in the race to succeed retiring Republican Jim Bunning. Mr. Grayson has received support from among others Mitch McConnell the state’s senior senator and the Republican leader in the Senate.Ms. Palin’s endorsement comes not long after she announced she will campaign for Texas Gov. Rick Perry Arizona Senator John McCain and Representative Michele Bachmann. Mr. Perry who is seeking a third full term faces Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in a high-profile primary while Mr. McCain could face a tough challenge from the right.The Times’s Ian Urbina took a closer look at Dr. Paul’s candidacy last November finding that the novice candidate with a libertarian streak was “capitalizing on a hearty distrust of government and an anti-Republican-establishment fervor among conservatives” to raise a large campaign war chest largely over the Internet.

 7381,  1964, a, SAIGON South Vietnam Dec. 31—Buddhist leaders met today in a national convention whose purpose was to unify the Vietnamese Buddhists and to thresh out their political course.Although the speakers' references to politics were veiled young Buddhist monks who gained their first taste of political action in demonstrations against the late President Ngo Dinh Diem earlier this year made plain they intended to weld Buddhism into a powerful and permanent political force.“The experiences of recent months have shown us that social events can deeply influence religious life because Buddhists are at the same time citizens of the country” declared Thich Tam Chau chairman of the intersect committee which led the religious and political movement that helped overthrow the Diem regime.Another speaker Thich Thien Minh called for a systematic organization of Buddhism. “Out of experience the Buddhists must be realistic” he said. “They should not consider religion as a vague doctrine but as a real organization.”

 2991,  2002, a, The first track on ''Songs for the Deaf'' (Interscope) the third album by Queens of the Stone Age consists entirely of a voice saying ''Huh? What?'' and then 90 seconds of hums and clicks. The second track begins with someone tuning a radio and a D.J. welcoming listeners to KLON: ''We play the songs that sound more like everyone else . . . than anyone else.'' There's a tinny drumbeat and a tinny guitar -- maybe the idea is to trick listeners into turning up the volume -- and then finally the whole band kicks in playing a loud fuzzy exhilarating song called ''You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar but I Feel Like a Millionaire.''The guitarist Josh Homme has described his music as ''robot rock'' in reference to his own metronomic style. But the vision he pursues is as flexible as the band's membership: on each album Mr. Homme and the bassist Nick Oliveri are joined by a rotating cast of musicians; the guests on ''Songs for the Deaf'' include the former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl on leave from his current band Foo Fighters. (Mr. Grohl is to perform with Queens of the Stone Age at Roseland in Manhattan on Thursday.)Many of the songs find simple ways to avoid predictability. On ''God Is on the Radio'' the band comes to a dead stop in the middle of every refrain. ''No One Knows'' is a battle between elegiac vocals and a chopped-up riff. And ''Song for the Dead'' grinds along works itself into a frenzy and then collapses exhausted.The album isn't quite as impressive as its predecessor ''Rated R.'' There are a few moments of monotony and the band's digressive approach is occasionally exasperating. Most of the time though the band succeeds charging (and sometimes lumbering) through a heavy mysterious disc filled with in-jokes. Careful listeners are rewarded near the end when a familiar guitar line jumps out of a spellbinding progressive-rock track: it's the same song the D.J. at KLON was listening to almost an hour ago.

 2289,  2006, a, It’s time for President Bush to go to China. I don’t mean that literally but metaphorically. It’s time for George Bush to do what Richard Nixon did – perform an act whose effectiveness is a function of the fact that he is the last man anyone would have expected to do it. What would that act be? It won’t be – and shouldn’t be – agreeing to a face-to-face one-on-one debate with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran if only because when you accept the other guy’s invitation you cede him the initiative and the position of leadership and we all know that George Bush will never willingly do that. No it has to be something that a) makes clear that he is the one in charge and b) is so surprising and (apparently) out of character that its very announcement alters the geopolitical landscape and disarms criticism in advance.President Bush should announce that he’s going to the Middle East for a 7-to-10-day trip and taking along Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a few congressional leaders from both parties. He should explain that it is not his intention to negotiate anything and certainly not to ask for anything. He should say that he just wants to see firsthand what is going on in a region that is the repository of mankind’s hopes and fears and so he will visit every country not only those that are already friendly to the West. He should declare that while he has every faith in U.S. intelligence and considers himself fully informed by the appropriate agencies there is simply no substitute for being on the ground where you can look the other fellow (or woman) directly in the eye. (He already says that all the time.)There would be any number of upsides to this venture (or adventure) and almost no downsides. (There would be one big one but we’ll get to that later.) First there is the political upside. Members of his own party could not demur without giving the Democrats a weapon in the upcoming elections and beyond. (See even when the president comes up with a good proposal his party’s regulars will nix it.) Democrats would be obliged to applaud the plan because it is a version of what they have been calling for all along – a turn from military action to diplomacy.And Democrats would not be able to upstage or imitate the initiative because any unilateral visit from them would be perceived as nothing more than a political sideshow a grandstanding gesture with no real power behind it to act. Best of all the Democratic leaders could not decline to participate for they would then come across as (what they often are) petulant obstructionist and weak.Then there is the upside of no possible bad outcome. If the relevant leaders refuse to host the U.S. delegation the administration still gets both local and international credit for having been willing to go. If the leaders accept but the trip is so complex an undertaking that it cannot occur before the midterm elections (as would almost certainly be the case) voters will give the administration credit anyway (credit on credit) for having the idea and being ready to act on it. (And besides whether the trip is stalled in progress or in the planning stages all the radio and TV commentators will talk about little else and names like Abramoff and Katrina will be distant memories.)If the trip comes off but goes badly – ugly protests at every step; transportation foul-ups; (mild) food poisoning; potentates princes and presidents refusing to engage in substantive conversation – the president gets to look like a heroic warrior persevering in the face of adverse circumstances. Even if there is no apparent yield the yield will already have been harvested. And if the trip is a success – crowds come to jeer but end up cheering endless photo-ops of the president interacting with the common man or woman in the street real conversations that produce a resolution to meet again or a joint statement declaring mutual respect and a commitment to future cooperation – the president should start writing the speech he will give when he receives the Nobel Peace Prize in Stockholm.Then there is the historical legacy. Forget about Abu Ghraib Enron Halliburton the Social Security fiasco the prescription drug fiasco the deficit fiasco the Iraq fiasco (the list could be continued indefinitely). President Bush will be remembered as the man who broke the Middle East impasse. The mere act of announcing the trip will be his version of “Tear down that wall Mr. Gorbechev.” This is an October surprise that could keep on giving for decades and even centuries and it would be risk-free.Well not quite. There is that one downside and its name is security. Every day hundreds of thousands of people in that part of the world declare that they want to kill George Bush and here would be the best chance they ever had to do it. Of course the security precautions would be massive. No government even a government hostile to the United States would want an assassination or even an attempt at an assassination to occur on its territory. And this would be one time when the hierarchical and despotic political structures about which we always complain would be a good thing: the more absolutist the regime the more likely that it will be able to identify and control (or perhaps “detain”) persons and groups who are thought to pose a threat of violence. Still security can never be perfectly tight and the possibility that a lone wing nut (a favorite term of the political right) might get through cannot be discounted. It would then be a matter of doing a cost-benefit analysis a balancing of the danger and its likelihood against the probability of a very large success.I’m serious. Despite the occasional tongue-in-cheek tone of the preceding paragraphs I really think this is a good idea. At the very least it would change the dynamic in the region without asking the president to yield an iota of moral or political authority.When I was a dean – to compare great things with small – and confronted by a disruptive and obstreperous faculty member or chairperson I would never call the difficult party into my office. Instead I would telephone and ask him or her if I might drop down and pay a visit. The result often (but not alas invariably) was to eliminate defensiveness and improve the chances that something constructive might actually get done; and while I sat there in the uncomfortable straight-backed chair I was still dean and everyone knew it.Now being a dean is nothing like being a president and walking down a few flights of stairs or taking an elevator is nothing like traveling half the world to make your way in hostile territory. But the gesture of going to someone else’s office (or house or parliament or mosque) is a powerful one that has the promise at least of wiping the slate clean and making a new beginning. It might just work. Nothing else has.
 2738,  2003, a, A lawyer for the city said that although the city had agreed to send out the directives the city maintains that no new policy of selective-enforcement has ever been instituted and that the increase in arrests merely reflects a sharp increase in the number of contacts between officers and homeless people.''There were more arrests because there was more activity'' the lawyer Gail Donoghue special assistant to the corporation counsel said. She described the directives as ''a confirmation of our existing policy and practice.''''The policy was and is as part of Police Department training and procedures that people are treated the same'' Ms. Donoghue said. ''But we didn't have these things written out.''''It is our policy'' she added. ''We have no reason not to write it down.''A police spokesman had no additional comment.The lawsuit charged that after reports in the news media last fall about a significant increase in the number of homeless people on the streets top police officials directed the Homeless Outreach Unit to change its mission from one of offering services to arrest. The suit said that officers had also been told that they were not to enforce the law in a similar manner against people who were not homeless.The new directives have been read aloud at 10 consecutive roll calls of the Homeless Outreach Unit and the Transit Bureau and distributed to individual officers the documents show.They also offer guidance to members of the Homeless Outreach Unit when carrying out their duties. For example if an officer finds a person stretched out on a subway seat or a park bench the officer must first ''take appropriate corrective action.''

 3085,  2001, a, To the Editor:Re ''A Global Warning to Mr. Bush'' (editorial Feb. 26):Before putting pressure on the White House to act shouldn't we be asking whether global warming is really happening?The Kilimanjaro ice cap is not a thermometer. It may well be melting but this is simply a delayed consequence of a natural climate warming during the early part of the 20th century. Moreover it will continue to melt as long as the climate doesn't return to the temperatures of the Little Ice Age of past centuries.The National Academy of Sciences published a report last year that defines the geographic regions of warming and cooling during the last 20 years.

 3435,  1999, a, Israel conducted an aerial bombardment tonight of what it said were four Hezbollah guerrilla strongholds deep inside Lebanon stung into action by a week of attacks that culminated in the killing of a general and three other Israelis in southern Lebanon earlier today.The air strikes took the conflict away from the Israeli-Lebanon border and into the heart of Lebanon risking an escalation of ping-pong attacks between the Israeli Army and the guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Party of God or Hezbollah.The heavy bombing ended a day of intense conflict in the low-level war in southern Lebanon beginning with unsuccessful rocket attacks on northern Israel. The final catalyst for their attack Israeli officials said was a roadside bomb this morning that killed the four Israelis including Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein 36 who became the highest-ranking officer to die in southern Lebanon in 16 years.A journalist Ilan Roeh 32 of Voice of Israel radio was also among those killed. He was accompanying the general to ''see things up close'' said his boss Shalom Oren.

 2058,  2007, a, Two columns in the June 30 issue of Wine Spectator provide a fascinating counterpoint in one of the most important aesthetic arguments in wine today. The first by James Laube one of the Spectator’s senior editors takes a swipe at those who complain about the high alcohol content in many of today’s wines. “If you taste a wine and it seems to be balanced’’ Laube writes “the alcohol content shouldn’t matter.’’That’s the standard retort from the high-alcohol apologists and it’s not really what makes the column interesting though it lets you know where Laube stands. No what makes the column worth reading is his point that high alcohol levels are a necessary tradeoff for “plush wines with loads of flavor body texture and depth.’’“For many of us more alcohol is an acceptable price for rich flavorful front-loaded wines that are engagingly complex and ready to drink the day you buy them’’ he writes. He does allow that he would prefer wines in the 13.5 percent range as in Bordeaux rather than at the 15 to 17 percent level that many California wines are currently hitting. “However in many other parts of the world including California many wines made at more moderate alcohol levels don’t have much flavor and reds are often too tannic’’ he says.Now I have to take issue with that last statement. My problem with many of the higher-alcohol wines particularly those from California is that they are overbearing. Too much flavor. Too jammy. Too sweet-tasting. Too powerful. Too plush. They taste the same and they don’t go with food. If you are used to eating steaks slathered with ketchup mayonnaise and all manner of secret sauce an unadorned steak may seem devoid of flavor – until you get used to eating that way again and your taste buds recover their appreciation for subtlety and nuance. To put it another way a marching band will always outblast a piano trio and if you are accustomed only to marching bands you may not appreciate the trio.Let’s be clear: Few people find high alcohol desirable in a wine. Some people find it a serious flaw. Others like James Laube tolerate it because they enjoy the big rich style of these wines. But to suggest that it’s necessary in California rather than a stylistic decision on the part of the winemaker is plain wrong. Laube as much as says so himself. “We’re living through a phase one of those periods where it’s fashionable to make the most expressive wine possible and that will change’’ he writes “expressive’’ being a euphemism for big.On that last point I happen to agree with him. In the last five years or so the pendulum has swung for California chardonnays. Of course the tropical fruit oak and buttered popcorn wines that were the defining style of the 1990’s are still widely available but many winemakers have come back to leaner less extravagant more Chablis-like chardonnays. They have backed away from power and toward finesse. I think 10 years from now we’ll see the same thing happening with red wines.By the way while I don’t care for many high-alcohol wines I don’t reject all of them. Many Châteauneuf-du-Papes exceed 15 percent and some of them are great. I’ve enjoyed some big California pinot noirs and zinfandels. And last year I wrote about Diatom a chardonnay from the Santa Rita Hills that was captivating despite its 16.2 percent alcohol. But on the whole I think balanced high-alcohol wines are fairly rare.A colleague of James Laube’s Matt Kramer has certainly spoken up for finesse in the past and in his column in this edition of the Spectator he asks the rhetorical question “Has pinot noir become boring?’’Kramer who is always one of the most thought-provoking wine writers examines the uniformity of many New World pinot noirs and points at the narrow selections of clones planted in many new pinot noir vineyards. Now I know discussion of clonal selections is a guaranteed turnoff for many wine lovers but I’ll ask your forbearance because I think Kramer’s point is important. The various versions of the popular Dijon clones all emphasize certain red and black fruit flavors which produce a powerful sameness rather than the complexity that might result from mixing together other clones of pinot noir.I’ve had the opportunity to taste wines made of different clones of pinot noir grown in the same vineyard and the differences can be astonishing. I remember one tasting session at the Hirsch Vineyards on the Sonoma Coast. David Hirsch poured wine made from a Pommard clone which had great acidity and vibrant fruit as well as a slight herbaceousness and an elegance. Then a wine from the Mount Eden clone which had a distinct raspberry flavor and a different Mount Eden clone which had a bright brilliant cherry flavor. Then a Swan selection which was dry structured and powerful with complex fruit and herbal flavors. Dijon clones seemed powerful too but with less dimension. The best wine of all was made from the various clones blended together.Kramer also addresses the important question of ripeness which he calls “the single most important aesthetic decision today.’’“Just when a grape is deemed ‘ripe’ has changed dramatically in the past decade’’ he writes. “This has resulted not only in more alcoholically powerful wines but in more uniform-tasting ones too. When a grape gets overripe it loses its more subtle flavor shadings.’’Exactly what I’ve been saying thank you. What’s especially disturbing is that pinot noir excels at making thrillingly subtle wines of great nuance. Instead we’re getting what Laube approvingly describes as “dark opulent New World cabernet or pinot noir brimming with broad rich flavors and smooth fleshy tannins.’’Jeez do we really want to lump cabernet and pinot noir together like that? My guess is Kramer would say absolutely not.I have to compliment the Spectator for publishing Laube and Kramer practically on adjoining pages in the magazine. Both men are far too gentlemanly to take a swipe at one another but if you close your eyes you can almost feel them throwing elbows back and forth.

 4699,  1992, a, For Ben Feder the Clinton campaign has been a bonanza. Mr. Feder is a pioneer Hudson Valley vintner. Since 1977 he has made a crisp dry white wine from the seyval blanc grape. Mr. Feder's estate is in Clinton Corners N.Y. and his label says Clinton Vineyards.By late October Mr. Feder usually has 700 cases of vintage-dated still wine in stock and 150 of nonvintage sparkling wine. But today his inventory has shrunk to 95 and 25 respectively. With the election approaching Democrats thirsty for more than the White House have rung the winery's phone off the hook.He could have sold every bottle during the Democratic Convention. But he kept some just in case Clinton headquarters called from Little Rock. "If there's an inauguration I'll need 750 to 1000 cases " he said. "I'm beating my brains out trying to figure out what to do."Mr. Feder's 1991 vintage was the best since 1984. With one eye he is watching his 1992 seyval evolve in tanks. With the other he's watching the tightening polls and wondering if the bubbles in the Democrats' champagne will go flat Tuesday night.

 3837,  1997, a, Why should anyone with a point-and-a-half lead and just three rounds to go in a tourney of top class players work hard to win more games? The Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov found out in the Madrid International Tournament which ended in early June. After six rounds he had set himself at a comfortable pace of draws to cruise safely into solo first place. But he reckoned without the remarkable zeal and energy of the Alexei Shirov a grandmaster formerly of Latvia who now lives in Spain.Shirov put on a three-game winning streak that allowed him to overtake Topalov and share first place. As improbable as that was Shirov is the man for that kind of effort. He habitually takes the kind of risk that often leads to such glamorous deeds. The moral is that Topalov should not have counted him out.In the seventh round Shirov daringly offered a pawn against his former Soviet colleague the grandmaster Valery Salov and won the game that started him on his final surge.The bluntest way of knocking out the e4 pawn is the 1 . . . d5 2 ed Qd5 of the Center Counter Game for which Black concedes White a tempo with 3 Nc3. Once considered primitive it has taken its place in the storehouse of current openings.

 5815,  1985, a, The upturn comes after nearly four years of layoffs and hiring freezes aimed at keeping state and local budgets in the black. Even after the recovery got rolling in 1983 these governments balked at hiring until they were sure of budget surpluses says Laura Ruben an economist for the Federal Reserve Board.But an end to the hiring may be already be in sight. Mrs. Ruben says that a recent survey showed that state and local budget surpluses are shrinking. For some 28 states surpluses will be less than 1 percent of expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 1986 -down from a comfortable 5 percent for 1985. The Almighty Yen? A stronger yen was a major goal of September's five-nation effort to force the dollar down against other currencies. During 1985's first two months the currency had weakened to 250 yen to the dollar which made Japanese imports even more attractive in the United States.Now says WataruYamamoto manager of foreign exchange at Fuju Bank Ltd. in New York because of the intervention effort - selling dollars in the open market - and because Japan tightened its money supply forcing up interest rates the yen has strengthened 17 percent against the dollar in the past six weeks. The currency is now close to the 200-to-the-dollar level - where it has not been since early 1981 - and may even break this ''psychological barrier'' said Mr. Yamamoto. But ''without continued intervention'' he said the yen ''would weaken to 230 to 240 by spring.'' Only lower interest rates in the United States or Japanese economic growth of better than 5 percent annually could keep the yen at about 200 otherwise Mr. Yamamoto contends.He considers the 200 mark to be an optimal one for both Japan and the United States: At stronger yen levels he says Japanese goods would become too expensive for Americans and his nation's exports would be hit too hard. As it is now a Japanese car that cost Americans $8000 when the yen was at 260 will cost $10400 with the yen at 200.Gourmet GrazingThe new American craze of nibbling throughout the day - grazing as it is called - has started to present a challenge for the nation's restaurateurs.

 1251,  2012, a, Victor R. Caivano/The Associated PressPARIS — It may be as difficult to believe for fans as it is for the Formula One teams and the media but the 2012 season is really finally over.It was the longest season ever with 20 races from March to the end of November on every continent except Africa and Antarctica. I heard some fans say the season was too long. For many years the norm had been 16 races which then crept up to 17 18 19. . . until we hit 20 this year. Personally I don’t feel the season was too long. Nascar has twice as many races.The difference is that Nascar’s Sprint Cup races all take place in the United States while the final third of the F1 season — from the Singapore Grand Prix in late September to the Brazilian Grand Prix last weekend — involved intensive travel from one time zone to another from one part of the world to another with no respite.The people who suffered the least through all that work play and travel were the Formula One drivers. They are the first to admit that.To close out the season there were three groups of three races one week apart in different parts of the world — Japan and South Korea; India and Abu Dhabi; Texas and Brazil. Journalists and team members were counting the dead in the last few races — sorry I mean the ill and the wounded.At least one journalist was sent home after arriving in Texas and it was discovered that he had contracted malaria on the India trip. Two others were thought to have malaria and were sent to rest in the hospital or their hotels. They did not apparently have malaria or the more worrying dengue fever.PhotoThe word from teams and other support personnel was that the illness level was much higher this season than normal. I was told in Austin that the venerable Dr. Sid Watkins Formula One’s great safety innovator who died in September had once said that for a complete physical recovery the human body needs a week for each time zone it crossed.Formula One personnel did not have that this year. My own travel schedule since early October: two weeks on the road one week at home in Paris two weeks on the road one week at home two weeks on the road.Am I complaining? No. But there were times when I knew my body was not finding the adequate time it needed to recover.The people who suffered the least through all that work play and travel were the Formula One drivers. They are the first to admit that. Everything is done to protect their health to give them sleep and a break. Having said that Sebastian Vettel the driver who won the title spent a fortune to rent a private jet to take him to the final races in order to diminish the physical exhaustion and stress. Looks like it might have worked — his Abu Dhabi and Brazil races were brilliant.Having said that on Thursday around 2 a.m. I noticed a fellow journalist suggesting that the results of the season might change due to a suspicion that Vettel had made an illegal move in Brazil. At first I thought it was a joke that the journalist was just having some fun now that the season was over and he like me was getting back into the rhythm of daily life.But I found that Ferrari had indeed sent a letter asking the International Automobile Federation the series’ governing body to clarify why Vettel had not been penalized for a move that appeared to break the rules. Had Vettel been given the usual 20-second penalty he would have dropped to eighth position and the Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso would have won the driver’s title.After I read the F.I.A. explanation of what had happened on the track it was clear that no rule had been broken. And when I saw that the F.I.A. had said all the teams and drivers had been educated in the correct way to deal with the electronic warning lights it made me suddenly think that perhaps whoever asked for clarification at Ferrari was also just too exhausted from all that travel to have remembered the details.In the end I learned that the only reason the whole issue came up was because fans had started showing videos on YouTube of the moment that Vettel had passed Jean-Eric Vergne. Ferrari had received thousands of queries from fans on why Vettel had not been penalized. So Ferrari sent an inquiry the F.I.A. quickly gave an explanation and Ferrari accepted it.It was interesting to see how the fans and YouTube can affect the climate surrounding the series. It was a season without major controversy — except for the Bahrain race — and the biggest controversy had suddenly come three days after the season ended pumped up by media and fan sites.Among my articles reviewing the season the main feature is an overview of the season; my Q&A with Bobby Epstein the chairman of the Circuit of the Americas where the U.S. Grand Prix ran in Austin two weeks ago. And this year I decided to put together a look at the two finalists Vettel and Fernando Alonso not only because of their contrasting styles but also because they both deserved the title.

 246,  2018, a, The debate on Wednesday between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his primary challenger Cynthia Nixon contained several moments of drama.Ms. Nixon called Mr. Cuomo “corrupt” and hammered him over his handling of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which she said he used “like an A.T.M.”Mr. Cuomo implored her to stop interrupting him. “I let you speak” he said.Ms. Nixon also repeatedly painted Mr. Cuomo as the tool of big-money donors. Mr. Cuomo responded by mentioning a series of requests Ms. Nixon made to friends at City Hall.

 1191,  2012, a, LOS ANGELES — Success in Hollywood can be measured in any number of ways: box-office grosses the number of assistants you employ … the size of your theme park ride.John Lasseter Pixar’s chief creative officer now has an entire “land” devoted to his “Cars” movies — 12 acres in all at a Disney park called California Adventure. James Cameron and Disney are working on a similar size “Avatar” land in Orlando. You can almost hear the grumbling from George Lucas who has a Disney ride based on his “Star Wars” films: James Cameron gets an entire land?Christopher Meledandri the animation whiz behind Universal hits like “Despicable Me” and “Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax” is still comfortably at the single ride stage and he’s tickled just to have that. A simulator-based ride called Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem opens Monday at Universal Orlando.Kevin Kolczynski/Universal OrlandoStrangely enough it’s a big deal for Universal’s parks division to build a ride based on a film made by its corporate cousin. In recent years a shortage of hit Universal movies has forced Universal parks to build attractions around rented franchises — “The Simpsons” from Fox “Transformers” from Paramount “Harry Potter” from Warner Brothers.So Mr. Meledandri is something of a corporate hero for delivering a movie popular enough to spawn not only a sequel (“Despicable Me 2” arrives next summer) but a ride. Comcast which took over Universal last year has high hopes that Minion Mayhem named for the little yellow creatures in “Despicable Me” won’t be Mr. Meledandri’s last theme park foray either.“We’re absolutely excited to do more of this” Mr. Meledandri said in a phone interview. He declined to elaborate but it’s easy to imagine him collaborating on upgrades to Seuss Landing an aging Dr. Seuss-themed area of Universal’s Orlando resort.Mr. Meledandri said the hardest part of converting “Despicable Me” to a ride involved the video sequences. “We found ourselves going to traditional cinematic techniques to capture emotion — a close-up for instance — but in a ride that’s not really an option; you would lose the feeling of immersion.”

 2515,  2004, a, Burns became a prosperous grocer and banker in a section of Hartford known as Frog Hollow which is where the Irish Catholic immigrants then lived. The culture followed his family when it moved to prosperous West Hartford.Initially young John was ashamed of being an Irish-American. He found the Irish in this country a parochial lot. But as he matured and tried to define himself he found he was drawn to Frog Hollow which he said gave him a strong sense of who he was.But typically he put a humorous edge on that saying that his family went ''from steerage to the suburbs in three generations.''As a boy Mr. Dunne stuttered and so he found it reassuring to write whatever it was he had to say in order to give a better account of himself. The more he wrote the better he got at capturing the speech patterns of others on paper. His mother wanted him to be a gentleman -- a businessman -- and in preparation for that his family sent him to the Portsmouth Priory school a Rhode Island institution run by the Benedictines.He did well enough there to gain admission to Princeton from which he earned his bachelor's degree in 1954. Soon after graduation he volunteered for the Army before he was drafted and underwent basic training at Fort Chaffee Ark. where he did not distinguish himself. He lost his rifle a mistake he called ''the military equivalent of a mortal sin'' and he failed to qualify on the firing range with whatever weapon they gave him to replace the one he had lost.After his discharge he dismayed his mother by choosing not to attend a business school and instead went to New York City. He worked at first for an advertising agency and eventually for Time magazine then a highly stylized and unabashedly conservative Republican organ. Mr. Dunne remained at Time for five years and liked journalism but decided he did not want to do it the way most journalists did.

 2368,  2005, a, Tourism experts had hoped that Rochester would capitalize on its Lake Ontario location a 171-mile boat trip from Toronto. The city found developers in the late 1990's when two Rochester natives Dominick DeLucia and Brian F. Prince took up the idea. The men friends since graduate school had made their fortunes at Lehman Brothers in New York City and returned to their hometown with the idea of helping it to better times. They spent several years putting together their plan and arranging financing from Dutch and Australian lenders for the purchase of the ferry last year for $42.5 million. The ferry has a movie theater a gift shop and a restaurant and can make the voyage in under three hours.Almost immediately their company Canadian American Transportation Systems ran into trouble. Mr. DeLucia said they were undercapitalized and could not cope with several mishaps including a docking accident at a Manhattan pier after the ferry was brought from an Australian shipyard to Rochester last spring. After repairs the engine malfunctioned. Both incidents pushed back the start date by several weeks while the company continued to incur payroll and other expenses.Higher fuel prices and customs and pilot fees added to the company's debt along with a loss of anticipated revenue from transporting tractor-trailers which were not allowed on board because of increased border security.The ferry which can carry 774 passengers and 238 cars often sold out. But the company was more than $2 million in debt by Labor Day. After only 80 days the owners abruptly stopped service leaving 200 without jobs and hundreds of others with worthless tickets."Reading the future isn't possible" said Magistrate Jonathan W. Feldman of the district court. Pointing out that there are "risks and rewards" in every business venture he said that "no one has ever disagreed" about the vessel being given a fair opportunity to succeed in this community."

 1227,  2012, a, Tom Szczerbowski/Getty ImagesOver the last couple of days two N.H.L. figures — Krys Barch an active journeyman and Wayne Gretzky the best player of all time — have made what at first blush seem like disturbing references to guns but on deeper inspection turn out to be fascinating glimpses into how long the players can hold out in the current lockout.And the odd thing is it is Barch who makes the more vivid case.On Monday Gretzky after speaking at a Toronto seminar on personal investment told The National Post he would have “shot myself” during his playing career if he had to miss a year because of a lockout. Alarming perhaps for a moment but it comes into perspective when he explains further.“There’s no way I could have taken a year off because there is no way I would have known what to do in the middle of my career taking a year off” Gretzky said. “That was my life.”Gretzky lived through one brief players’ strike and one owners’ lockout that cost half a season so he knows of what he speaks. (And he still has the common touch as Dave Bidini shows in an account of meeting the Great One in New York last month.)But while he merely said it would have been difficult to sit out a year former players who experienced the 2004-5 full-season lockout like Mike Modano Bill Guerin and Dave Andreychuk have said missing a year simply was not worth it.“It’s money you feel you never get back” Modano told ESPN last month. “Everybody thought: ‘Let’s not let each other down. Let’s do it for the future of the game. Blah blah blah.’ You’re only in the game so long.”Not exactly a to-the-barricades pro-union view. The same for Guerin who said last year of the 2004-5 lockout that “burning a year was ridiculous” and that the N.B.A. players like the N.H.L. players are in an owners’ league “and you are going to play when they want.”Andreychuk advised the locked-out N.B.A. players last year to settle quickly because “if players think it’s better to sit out the season let me tell them it’s not – it’s just not.”On Saturday night Barch a fourth-line enforcer who signed last summer with the Devils put out on his Twitter account what amounted to a soul-baring 625-word cri de coeur about the lockout in which he confessed to have been drinking eight Old Vienna beers and a bottle of port while listening to Neil Young.“Sometimes wondering if I should have existed when a word and a gun solidified and solved all problems” he wrote.But the rest of Barch’s essay (ably translated into regular paragraphs by USA Today) makes a deeper point. He speaks as a five-and-a-half-year N.H.L. veteran on a $700000 salary who makes his living “through sweating bleeding cut Achilles’ broken hands concussions broken orbital bones eight teeth knocked out etc.” He’s got two kids and a third on the way wondering what he’s going to do “to get our family ahead.”It sounds as if he is going to explain why he wants his union to accept a quick settlement but no.“I wonder if the owners of Boston New York Washington etc. etc. have endured any of the injuries that I or any other player in the N.H.L. have endured” Barch wrote. “Still they probably sit there smoking the same brand of cigar sipping the same cognac and going on vacation to one of the five houses they own while we sit here knowing they want to take 20 percent of our paychecks.”Then Barch tackles the revenue-sharing proposal rejected by the league:“If the N.H.L. wants to keep teams in the South in struggling markets then the players along with the financially well-to-do teams need to start working together. Or they need to start to move teams to the North where they will make money.”Finally Barch sums up with as eloquent an old-fashioned call for union solidarity as anyone could muster.“The system allows the owners to continually take money from the players contract after contract where eventually over 40-some years the owners will have 80 percent of the revenue” he wrote. “The only way to stop the work stoppages long into the future is to fix the root cause of the problems. … Let the league and the players come together to fix the mistakes that have been made and make sure none are made in the future.”Perhaps when this lockout is over Barch will be as bitter about his experience with trade unionism as Modano Guerin and Andreychuk are now. Or perhaps he will have Gretzky’s take that sitting around idle would make him stir-crazy.But right now at least Barch is the pro-union bard of the 2012 N.H.L. lockout.

In all these warring countries the national interest determines whether or not a license to deal with the enemy will be granted so that patents are by no means inviolate.

 5261,  1988, a, The new ''Mikado'' - which will shortly be seen in Los Angeles with Dudley Moore in Mr. Idle's place - startled the British press and public by throwing out the usual Japanese trappings in favor of a British hotel lobby of the late 1920's complete with a monochromaticaly dressed cast straight out of a Marx Brothers film. Mr. Miller's aim was to bring Gilbert's burlesque of English manners closer to our time by changing the setting to something more recognizable to modern audiences. Detractors thought the change just as arbitrary and gimmicky as Mr. Miller's ''Rigoletto'' resetting in New York's Little Italy another production done for the E.N.O. and others pointed out that the spectacle of japonaiserie was part of the thrill of ''The Mikado'' whether in 1885 or a century later.On the recording the sets and costumes are immaterial and those seeking any revisionist reading of Gilbert's lyrics or Sullivan's score will find very few changes. They will find just over an hour of music left untouched and sung nicely and a new set of lyrics for Ko-Ko's ''little list'' song. These written by Mr. Idle and Mr. Miller (and published by Kay-Gee-Bee Music) attempt a mild offensiveness in the Monty Python mode. During his lifetime Gilbert sanctioned encore verses - written by himself - and it might have been a good idea to have let Mr. Idle do the originals first. (In performance there is a new overture of no great interest which has not been included here.) Of the singers I enjoyed Felicity Palmer as Katisha; some may find Bonaventura Bottone's Nanki-Poo just too-too in its exaggerated 1920's musical-comedy tone. By releasing only highlights the original British record company seems to have judged that the public would want just a souvenir of this picturesque production rather than a musically complete version.The new ''Ruddigore'' is a different matter being more complete than any previous version of the operetta. In the days that followed the badly received premiere of that operetta Gilbert and Sullivan made quite a few cuts and changes mostly in the problematic second act in which a chorus of ghosts not only step out of their picture frames but marry the female chorus at the work's conclusion. This distasteful finale was replaced (although one of the dead baronets still teams up with his former sweetheart) and the offending ''y'' in ''Ruddygore'' was changed to an ''i'' at a time when ''ruddy'' or ''bloody'' were too much for family audiences.In spite of these alterations a respectable eight-month London run and various tours the operetta sank into a ghostly oblivion. When it finally was revived in London in 1921 two D'Oyly Carte musical directors had made numerous ''improvements'' on Sullivan's original manuscript and another Malcolm Sargent added his own thoughts a few seasons later.Surprisingly many of these emendations improved ''Ruddigore'' - the 1920's overture (like the original not arranged by Sullivan) is more exciting the ghost scene is thrillingly condensed discarding a dull dead march and some weary choral responses as well as two attempts at a patter song right after the ghost scene that were simply ineffective. On the other hand certain cuts restored in this recording are delightful particularly the original finale (''When a Man Has Been a Naughty Baronet'') missing second verses and the charming love duet in Act I (''The Battle's Roar Is Over''). One also gets to hear the melodrame in Act II involving a dagger but this would have been more effective with the dialogue it is supposed to accompany.

 4109,  1995, a, Jeffrey Babcock a founder of the New World Symphony in Miami and the director of the Cultural Olympiad seems entirely comfortable with its mix of funk flash grit and show biz. "What we're doing is different than creating and presenting a free-standing independent arts festival" said Mr. Babcock who was in Los Angeles with the Philharmonic when the 1984 Summer Olympics were held in that city. "Our mission is to enhance the overall Olympic experience to be an important add-on component of the Games experience. You can't compare this with a festival like Spoleto."Similarly Mr. Rifkin of the High Museum said he was not worried about the art world sniping at "Rings." "If people want to call it hokey that's fine" he said. "I know there will be critics no matter what you do. But if it works to bring people to begin to see and appreciate works of art of different cultures it will be very successful. It's trying to be populist in spirit and it's only because of the Olympics that we have the opportunity to do it."On the surface art and athletics may not have much to do with each other but in fact from the time of ancient Greece the Olympics have integrated sports and culture. The form has varied in recent years. In Los Angeles a small group hired by the Olympic organizers put on the cultural festivities which were criticized locally as lacking in community involvement. In Barcelona Spain organization of the Cultural Olympiad was kept entirely separate from that of the Olympics as a way to enhance its artistic independence. But its organizers ran out of money six months before the Games started and many people felt the cultural events that did take place were difficult to find.Atlanta has tried to involve as many people as possible from the city and regional art communities. And in keeping with its "run it like a business" civic ethic it has taken a route opposite to that taken by Barcelona. Planning of the cultural programs is fully integrated into the planning of the Olympics to such a degree that visitors will be able to buy a package that might include the javelin throw women's basketball the Atlanta Symphony and the Dallas Black Dance Theater.That approach has helped with fund-raising and efficiency but it has at times led to clashes between the Olympic organizers and the local arts community. Many kinks have been ironed out but some in Atlanta's arts world still see the organizers including Billy Payne the president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games as intrusive micromanagers with no feeling for art."There's a narrowness of vision there" said one cultural figure who would only speak anonymously. "They see art as a dangerous business. It could be controversial."

 4667,  1992, a, "I don't feel like it was a raw deal for me" Hector said. "With six weeks I should be ready to go."Hector said that he's leaving open the possibility that the Jets will call him back but he said there were no guarantees offered when he reached his injury settlement with team officials this morning."If they feel like after six weeks I'm 100 percent healthy and I can help the team then they'll call me back" Hector said.Coslet said the thought of having Hector return about the middle of the season was in the back of the Jets officials' minds when they made the injury settlement. Coslet said the team's situation would dictate whether Hector would be brought back at the end of six weeks.Hector said he hadn't thought about the possibility of being picked up by another team. That is unlikely since he has an injury that will require six weeks to heal. If he does not return to the Jets he will be remembered for his performance against Miami in the final game of last season. Coming off the bench and subbing for an injured Thomas Hector had 13 carries for 132 yards and helped put the Jets in the playoffs for the first time since 1985.Heading into training camp this year Hector was facing stiff competition for the fourth running-back spot from A. B. Brown who was coming off a knee injury and Chaffey a big fullback who blocks and catches well. When Brown was cut last week Hector realized he was vulnerable.With Taylor and Stargell being cut the Jets no longer have any of their draft picks from the second through the sixth round of the 1990 draft.

 208,  2018, a, When Amazon announced last week that it was buying the online pharmacy PillPack it sent stocks of drugstore companies like Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbling as investors worried that the retail behemoth would soon upend the pharmacy market.But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers it may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That’s because to succeed it will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well.As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenues PillPack most likely didn’t attract much attention from the pharmacy industry’s giants said Eric Percher an equity research analyst at Nephron Research.“I think they have absolutely been able to fly under the radar” he said. But now that a household name like Amazon is buying the company “the entities that have enabled PillPack’s success — whether they knew it or not — have a decision to make” he said.
 3050,  2001, a, The questions hung heavily in the air and then seemed to fill the room.Daniel R.

Powell a four-star general who had served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had run the war that ousted Iraq from Kuwait had flirted with running for president and was now poised to become secretary of state?Or would he turn out to be Aspin redux a figure like the Clinton administration's first defense secretary Representative Les Aspin who was well liked and respected as a brilliant mind on defense matters but who was widely viewed by White House and Pentagon officials at the end of his tenure as an indecisive and ineffective manager who lost President Clinton's confidence and had to resign?

 5436,  1987, a, He must have felt our eyes fixed firmly on his back because every time he turned around those same eyes attacked his chest. These were not the polite furtive glances of shy-away women; these were visual kicks in the pants table-banging glares from three children waiting for their birthday party to begin.Eventually it did begin or rather it continued complete with hot soup frypan bread and hot coffee - and three desserts because as in the rum-tippling times of Dylan Thomas's Auntie Hannah birthdays like that came only once a year.A few years ago Mrs. Fisher and I exchanged birthday gifts on the 27th of June extending the holiday further back than usual. She gave me a small wooden chest filled with coated almonds and wine vinegar made from fresh herbes de Provence steeped in good French white wine. I gave her a set of 60 petit four tins in five different patterns. Her reaction was underwhelming.''Oh dear more things to make'' she said. Then she reassured me that she would use them and send along the results. A year later however when I opened her birthday gift to me there were the tins never used untouched. I don't think she knew or maybe she did.In a sense her most fascinating birthday story has not yet happened. I heard the start of it a few weeks ago as we sat outside on her porch under the postcard-blue sky of the Sonoma wine country. From her high-backed wicker chair she pointed to the parched flaxen field stretching like an endless tatami mat all the way to the black-green mountains in the distance. For 16 years she explained on her birthday or very close to it a huge barn owl flew across that field and landed on the telephone pole a few hundred yards from the porch.''It was at least three feet high and it must have had a nine-foot wingspan'' she said. And it was definitely the same old owl year after year.Before her last birthday some people came over with a sad story. ''They said they were sorry'' she recalled ''but they'd found the owl or rather the skeleton of the owl on the ground. A coyote had got him they thought.'' Came her birthday and she was sitting on the same porch same chair looking out across the yellow-white hay when a much smaller owl -''Maybe the grandson'' she ventured - alighted on the pole.
 5873,  1984, a, The sales tax in Suffolk County will increase a quarter of a percentage point Saturday from 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent.As a result an extra penny of tax will be added to every $4 worth of goods or services purchased in the county.The increase was approved by the County Legislature in September to help bail out the Southwest Sewer District and to avoid a doubling of sewer taxes for Islip and Babylon residents who live in the district.William Brotherton the deputy county executive in charge of finance said that most of the tax increase would be spent in the sewer district for the first two years. But he said that over the five-year life of the tax increase nearly 40 percent of the $115 million he expects it to yield would be spent in other sewer districts to lower tax rates.

 2684,  2004, a, Brazil's economy grew at its fastest pace in the third quarter in eight years lifted by surging exports and a sharp increase in domestic consumption. The government's statistics agency said that gross domestic product expanded 6.1 percent from July through September compared with the year-earlier period. The most recent performance was the fastest growth rate for the quarter since 1996. When compared with the second quarter however the economy grew a more modest 1 percent slightly below most forecasts. All sectors of the economy expanded in the quarter with exports soaring 18.2 percent from a year ago and industrial output rising 7 percent. Household consumption meanwhile rose 5.7 percent the biggest increase since 1997. Brazil's economy South America's largest is expected to grow 4.66 percent this year. But growth is expected to slow to about 3.5 percent in 2005 as a recent increase in interest rates threatens to weigh on the economy. The government also revised last year's growth numbers saying the economy expanded 0.54 percent in 2003 instead of shrinking 0.2 percent. Todd Benson (NYT)

 1678,  2009, a, Corinne Ball is used to dealing with high-stakes situations.In a recent interview with Investment Dealers’ Digest Ms. Ball who is the lead attorney advising Chrysler in its Chapter 11 case recalled the beginning of her career as a bankruptcy lawyer in the 1970s. She was brought into a room where Abe Beame the mayor of New York at the time was signing a petition to put the city in Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.“That was my first assignment working on rescuing the city” she told the publication. “How could you not resist working on the biggest rescue that anyone had seen at that point?”New York never actually filed of course. But Chrysler just did. And Ms. Ball co-head of the restructuring and reorganization practice in Jones Day‘s New York office. is likely to draw upon her years of experience as she guides the automaker through its high-profile and highly political reorganization.On Friday Ms. Ball appeared in court for the first-day hearing in Chrysler’s case. (Zachery Kouwe of The New York Times wrote about the hearing here.)Ms. Ball is no stranger to Chrysler: She was on the legal team back in the 1980s that helped save the Detroit automaker which at the time was run by Lee Iacocca. Since then she has worked on a number of major workouts and wind-downs including the collapse of the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert in the early 1990s and more recently the restructuring of Dana the auto parts supplier.Ms. Ball spent the first 23 years of her career at Weil Gotshal & Manges which is advising Lehman Brothers in its Chapter 11 the largest in United States history. She moved to Jones Day in 2001.With all that expertise Ms. Ball’s services don’t come cheap: Court filings show her billing rate is $900 an hour.— Cyrus SanatiGo to Ms. Ball’s Bio from Jones Day »Go to Article from Investment Dealers’ Digest (Subscription Required) »Go to Article from Reuters »

 1684,  2009, a, Chrysler is the first major automaker since Studebaker in 1933 to try to reorganize in bankruptcy and emerge as a viable company. The process can be complicated. The New York Times’s Micheline Maynard takes a quick look at how it is likely to play out.Q. Is Chrysler going out of business?A. No. Chrysler is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The law allows companies to shed assets restructure debt cancel contracts and close operations that normally would have to continue running. Once they secure financing to emerge from bankruptcy these companies are reconstituted as new legal entities.Should Chrysler fail to successfully reorganize it might turn to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy which would mean a liquidation.Q. How long will this take?A. The Obama administration spoke of a “surgical bankruptcy” that it said could be completed in 30 to 60 days. It plans to use Section 363 of the bankruptcy code to sell assets rid the company of liabilities and restructure its debt creating a new Chrysler.In reality most bankruptcies take much longer. United Airlines spent more than three years under bankruptcy protection. Delphi the auto parts supplier has been in Chapter 11 since 2005. The bankruptcy by LTV a steel maker took seven years to resolve.Bankruptcy law changed in 2005 to give management of a company the exclusive right to draft a plan of reorganization. A judge can extend that period exclusivity for 18 months but creditors or potential buyers for a company can present a competing plan once that period expires.Q. What happens to Chrysler dealers?A. Chrysler is able under bankruptcy to cancel franchise agreements with its dealers and the government said that would happen. Dealers can sue to block the action but a final decision would be up to the judge. In the meantime Chrysler will continue to provide dealers with vehicles to sell.Chrysler Financial will cease making consumer loans for Chrysler vehicles; GMAC with support from the government will provide financing through Chrysler dealers.Q. What happens to Chrysler employees?A. The White House said it did not expect any reductions in white- or blue-collar jobs as a result of the bankruptcy. However Chrysler employees who are not union members do not have any job security. The company can ask a judge for an immediate pay cut for its salaried employees and can announce job eliminations and close offices just as it can outside bankruptcy.Contracts covering members of the United Automobile Workers union and other unions will remain in force until the company asks a judge to void them. U.A.W. members approved changes to their contract on Wednesday that presumably would mean the contract would stay in place.But if the company asked for contracts to be terminated and replaced with terms it can more readily afford the union would have a chance to respond in court. Negotiations would take place before any cuts were imposed. This process could take months.Q. Are pensions and retiree health care benefits protected?A. Companies have the right under bankruptcy law to ask to terminate their pension plans. If such a request was made a judge would convene a brief trial on the subject and hear both sides. If pensions were terminated employees would still receive about one-third of their benefits through financing from the federal pension agency.A company also can eliminate retiree health care benefits for nonunion employees; they would subsequently be covered by Medicare. The U.A.W. and Chrysler agreed in 2007 to transfer responsibility for union retiree health care to a special fund and the fund would administer those retiree benefits.Q. What happens to Chrysler suppliers?A. In its bankruptcy filing Chrysler listed its 50 biggest creditors holding unsecured claims meaning those that would have to get in line behind creditors whose debt is secured by collateral like the company’s plants brands and other assets. The unsecured creditors include its advertising agency BBDO and parts suppliers like Johnson Controls Magna International and Cummins Engine.The White House said supplier contracts would remain in force and it has created a program to provide federal help to parts makers. But in bankruptcy supplier contracts can be canceled.Chrysler is likely to tell the court which suppliers it wants to keep doing business with and which contracts it wants to reject. Suppliers could challenge the rejection of their contract but most likely they would have to reach a settlement with Chrysler.Q. What happens next in the bankruptcy case?A. Chrysler filed its initial paperwork with the federal bankruptcy court in New York on Thursday. On Friday it will ask a judge to issue a series of rulings called the first day orders which allow the company to keep operating. They may include authorizing the payment of routine expenses like salaries and payments to vendors including its lawyers and whatever else Chrysler needs to run its business. Chrysler said it would halt production while it completes a deal with Fiat.Once the case begins Chrysler can ask a judge to issue an emergency order to temporarily reduce salaries which is meant to conserve its cash. A committee will also be formed that represents Chrysler’s creditors.Q. Should owners of Chrysler cars and trucks be concerned?A. The federal government said it would back the warranties on vehicles bought from Chrysler while it is operating in bankruptcy. So effective Thursday warranties are underwritten by the government.Owners of Chrysler vehicles bought before Thursday should expect their warranties to be honored until they expire. But the work may not be performed by a Chrysler dealer. Companies operating in bankruptcy sometimes ask a judge to let them assign warranty repairs to outside vendors who charge the company less for their work than a dealer would expect to be reimbursed.Owners whose vehicle warranties have run out are liable for any problems with their cars and trucks as they are now.Go to Article from The New York Times »
 5098,  1989, a, To the Editor:Williamson M. Evers (''Does America Need a 'G.I. Bill' for Youth?'' Op-Ed April 15) argues that Senator Sam Nunn's plan to make student aid conditional on one or two years of service to the state would if enacted ''revive the concept of indentured servitude a form of bondage in Colonial America.'' He adds ''Hundreds of thousands of young people would become 20th-century indentured students.''If Mr. Evers were right the Nunn plan would be not only bad policy but also unconstitutional. The 13th Amendment (1865) prohibits not only chattel ''slavery'' but also any other form of ''involuntary servitude.'' The latter words were included to outlaw any vestiges of indentured bondage inherited from Colonial American law and the similar system of peonage in the Territory of New Mexico inherited from Spanish and Mexican law. In 1867 Congress passed the antipeonage law still on our statute books (42 United States Code s 1994) which enforces the 13th Amendment by making null and void all laws enforcing the ''service or labor of any persons . . . in liquidation of any debt or obligation or otherwise.''The flaw in Mr. Evers's thesis is its confusion of two radically different phenomena: (1) the state's compelling the performance by the servant of a contract for personal service to pay off a debt previously incurred and (2) the offer of a future benefit (a college education) in return for the completion of voluntary service in a national program.The first is a description of involuntary servitude which is prohibited by the 13th Amendment. The second which features neither debt nor compulsion is the essence of the Nunn plan. The difference between the two is vital: an indentured servant like a New Mexican peon could not walk off his job with impunity. If he did the authorities could recapture him put him back to work and if he refused put him in jail. Under Senator Nunn's plan a voluntarily participating would-be college student would be free to drop out of the program at any time. CYRIL C. MEANS JR. New York April 15 1989

 6365,  1970, a, Tugboat workers who went out on strike Feb. 1 will vote this morning on a new manage ment offer.The first offer—a 43 per cent package over three years —was rejected by Local 333 United Marine Division Na tional Maritime Union on March 15. Maritime observers said yesterday that the current offer probably constituted a juggling of the old package with more money going to wages.It has been management's contention in recent weeks that the 43 per cent increase includ ing 32 per cent in wages was the limit especially in view of widespread opposition to such a large offer in employer ranks.Management sources and others close to the dispute con tinued to express amazement yesterday as to why the union's leadership was unable to “sell” the 43‐per‐cent package.There is general agreement on both sides that the package was a good one—by itself and in relation to recent labor set tlements in the maritime in dustry.
 1809,  2008, a, SIOUX CITY Iowa – Representative Dennis Kucinich urged his Iowa followers today to select Senator Barack Obama as their second choice at the caucuses on Thursday if his support is not strong enough to be viable in the 1781 precincts across the state.“Senator Obama and I have one thing in common: Change” Mr. Kucinich said in a statement today.The two spoke briefly by telephone before Mr. Obama flew here for an afternoon rally. In a statement Mr. Obama took advantage of the opportunity to point out that he along with Mr. Kucinich opposed the war in Iraq. “He and I have been fighting for a number of the same priorities” Mr. Obama said.Four years ago during his first presidential bid Mr. Kucinich announced a similar second-choice partnership with John Edwards. At the time aides to Mr. Edwards said it helped contribute to his second-place finish in the caucuses.This year however Mr. Kucinich has barely waged a campaign in Iowa. He has no paid organizers or offices in the state and he was not invited to participate in The Des Moines Register’s debate in December. Still it is not uncommon to see faded Kucinich bumper stickers on cars at rallies for Democratic presidential candidates.We’ll see on Thursday whether they follow Mr. Kucinich’s advice.

 335,  2017, a, LOS ANGELES — “Victory!!!”With that single aggressively punctuated tweet Phillip Iscove a creator of the Fox drama “Sleepy Hollow” summed up what Hollywood writers seemed to be feeling on Tuesday after a middle-of-the night deal between studios and writers to avert a strike.Conspicuously not doing a victory lap was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers which bargains on behalf of studios.A tentative agreement for a new three-year master contract with the producers’ alliance and unions representing more than 12000 television and movie writers was reached at around 1 a.m. on the West Coast. The previous contract expired at midnight and the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East had vowed to go on strike as early as Tuesday morning. A walkout would have immediately sent late-night comedy shows into reruns and threatened important presentations planned by ABC CBS Fox and NBC to attract advertising.The unions declared in an email to members that they had won “unprecedented gains.” Leaders added: “Did we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild’s members $130 million more over the life of the contract than the pattern we were expected to accept.”
 4525,  1993, a, Louise Fishman Robert Miller Gallery 41 East 57th Street Manhattan Through Oct. 16One becomes accustomed to Louise Fishman's latest abstractions in the way one acclimates to seeing objects in the dark. Her large canvas called "Mars" is at first a forbidding wall of black and gray wrapped in a grid whose painted lines are like straps of black leather. Then the darkness yields up patches of red and flecks of white like light dimly glinting on the edges of the straps. This yielding up is a beautiful slow process and it means that "Mars" intensifies in the variety and impact of its effects.Sometimes as in "Sanctum Sanctorum" "Valles Marineris" and "Shadows and Traces" the rectangles within the thick framework of the uneven grid become windows of mottled colors windows not so much onto some fictional deep space but onto a painstaking and elaborate painterly process. Ms. Fishman's art is about surface gesture and light. But it is also about this intense and step-by-step process of pictorial construction.With the heavy thrusting black and white streaks in "Iron Sharpens Iron" a different more athletic kind of artistic labor is suggested but one that remains measured contained in its approach.With some of the smaller works in the show where the grid becomes indiscernible the colors clash and the composition devolves into a frenzy of clotted paint Ms. Fishman loses her grip. The grip must be tight for the works to succeed. And it is in the bigger paintings where the emotions feel hard-won and the complex making of the images seduces the eye slowly that Ms. Fishman confirms her position as an artist of seriousness and substance.

 2149,  2007, a, These are tumultuous times for flamboyant developer Donald Trump.First the Wall Street Journal printed a detailed article suggesting The Donald’s name has been “tarnished” by the lackadaisical results posted by several projects carrying his name. “Even the Trump name isn’t bigger than the calamitous condo market” concluded the WSJ article which focused on Florida properties.Trump TrumpThat prompted an angry response from Trump who described the article as “one of the most ridiculous I have read in many years.” (Subscription required to read full letter.)Now he’s embroiled in a controversy in Scotland over his attempt to build a €1.4 billion seaside golf resort including two golf courses a luxury hotel and about 1500 homes north of Aberdeen. In a setback for Trump the local town council rejected the plan as out of scale with the area. Mr. Trump was “shocked” a spokesman told the Associated Press.But Trump’s fans are fighting back and an emergency meeting has been called as detailed in this story in the Financial Times.Meanwhile in a front page story the Aberdeen Evening Express labeled the councilors who voted against the project “You Traitors.”In an interview with the paper Trump said he felt he had let down his late mother—who was Scottish—in failing to win approval for the project.
 3982,  1996, a, Last year when Joel Robuchon said he would retire at 50 the food world wondered whether it was just an idle threat. But if he did go through with the move and walk away from a Michelin three-star career who could possibly succeed him at the restaurant that bears his name in the hotel Le Parc in Paris?Now the foo' world has its answers. Mr. Robuchon announced last week that he would retire from the restaurant on July 5 at 51 and that on Aug. 12 Alain Ducasse the Michelin three-star chef of Le Louis XV in Monte Carlo Monaco would take over. Th' restaurant will be renamed Alain Ducasse.Mr. Ducasse 39 will not have a minute to spare. He will remain as the chef of Le Louis XV and will be the first chef to try to juggle two three-star dining rooms. He says he likes a challenge."It will only be a problem two days a week and 40 weeks a year" he said.Only?Mr. Ducasse explained that the Paris restaurant is closed on Saturdays and Sundays while Le Louis XV is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. And each closes for six weeks during different seasons. "It only takes an hour to fly from one to the other" he added. "And missing a day or so a week in each restaurant is not much. Think of the time most chefs are not in the kitchen."

 1443,  2010, a, JACKSONVILLE Fla. — Even with one more win Bobby Bowden couldn’t gain ground on Penn State’s Joe Paterno the coach with the most career victories in the Football Bowl Subdivision. At the same time Florida State was beating West Virginia 33-21 in Bowden’s swan song at the Gator Bowl Paterno’s Nittany Lions were holding off L.S.U. 19-17 at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando.Paterno 82 has 394 victories. Bowden 80 ended his 55-year coaching career with 389 but stands to lose as many as 14 of those because of academic misconduct.“I wanted 400 so bad” Bowden said “because I felt like well Joe is going to beat me. When they took away those games Joe is going to beat me. And if I could just get to 400 it would be me and him. I could hang around with him and follow him around a little bit.”Bowden who has coached the past 34 seasons at Florida State was forced to resign at the end of the Seminoles’ 6-6 regular season. He will be replaced by the offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher. Bowden wished to coach one more year so he could reach the 400-win milestone. Despite not being able to go out on his own terms Bowden said he is at peace.“I’m not ate up with coaching football at my life” he said. “I have got 80 years in. I wanted 81 but I got 80 years in. I wanted more and couldn’t have it. They wouldn’t let me have it.”He added: “I have always felt like you can’t take it with you. If I want more games than anybody else which I’m not Joe is so what? When I die I can’t take it with me. There are things in life more important. There are just things more important than that to me. That’s why I’m at peace with myself.”He said he was reminded after the game that victories aren’t everything. In the locker room Bowden’s players asked him to sign their jerseys and he was able to spend a few minutes with former players like Derrick Brooks and Chris Weinke one of two Heisman Trophy winners that Bowden coached.“It is a great closeness there” Bowden said. “It’s is like a family. And I really appreciate all those boys coming back to the game.”

 4101,  1995, a, Re: "Talk Radio Bulldog Is Really Just a Pussycat Friends Say" (Nov. 27) an article about Bob Grant:He's a wonderful man and he loves dogs and children. Where have we heard that one before? The ages have provided us with countless figures who were sweet to their families friends dogs and followers while they were causing terrible trouble for the innocent. Mr. Grant is a very intelligent person who knows exactly what he's doing.His endless tirades and personal name calling are renowned. It should not have taken an election to bring them out for discussion.Do you really think it's such a wonderful thing that he goes to the diner and listens quietly to the hoi polloi? Does the fact that so many of his constituents agree with him make him right?Mr. Grant has been ignored by targeted politicians and the news media alike. A very big mistake. I believe his success was used over the last decade by the conservative elements as a standard for setting up radio personalities all over the country. They didn't help anyone get elected but they certainly contributed to the defeat of many candidates some good and some bad.
 152,  2018, a, But Ms. Kotb a longtime fan favorite for her freewheeling segments with Ms. Gifford has provided more than a steadying hand and may even have given the show a boost. NBC has defeated its ABC rival “Good Morning America” every week since Mr. Lauer was removed something it had not done for four consecutive weeks in more than five years.The “Today” lead has narrowed — the program averaged around 4.4 million viewers the week before Christmas about 54000 viewers more than “G.M.A.” — and there is some uncertainty whether the lead is sustainable. Further all three morning shows experienced rating drops last year.A surprise boon from an emergency host isn’t new at NBC. When Brian Williams was suspended for six months in 2015 from his evening newscast after he was caught embellishing stories about a Middle East reporting assignment Lester Holt replaced him and the show’s viewership figures were strong. Mr. Holt became the permanent replacement later that year.Likewise the departures of Charlie Rose from “CBS This Morning” and Mr. O’Reilly from Fox News after public allegations of sexual misconduct have done little to disrupt either network. Fox News is still No. 1 among cable news networks in prime time and the ratings for “CBS This Morning” have held steady while Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell continue in Mr. Rose’s absence. (CBS has not yet hired a replacement.)Ms. Kotb cut her teeth as a local reporter and anchor including a six-year stint for the CBS affiliate in New Orleans. She joined NBC in 1998 as a correspondent for “Dateline.”

 3688,  1998, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson students investigate the role of mathematics in their everyday lives. They then discover through reading a Times article and through analyzing a specific example of art that mathematics exists on a deeper ‘metaphoric’ level in art.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. List and discuss all that they do on a daily basis that involves mathematics both on obvious and more hidden levels.2. Read and discuss “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction.”3. Relate a mathematical concept metaphorically to a piece of art.Resources / Materials:paperpens/ pencilscopies of “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students list all the things that they do that involve mathematics. Students then share their lists with the class as the teacher writes suggestions on the board. Students then add to the class list by brainstorming other daily tasks or chores that involve mathematics.2. Read the article “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” and discuss the following questions:–The author of this piece argues that “Good Will Hunting” is not a movie about math just because much of the plot revolves around a mathematical genius. How does he support this argument? What stereotypes about mathematicians does he feel are promoted by the movie?–In what way does the movie “Sliding Doors” relate to mathematical concepts?–How does Chuck Close’s art retrospective incorporate mathematics?–How does the novel “Larry’s Party” relate to mathematical concepts?–What does the writer mean when he says that “mathematics like beauty is more than skin-deep”?3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students search for mathemetical metaphors in favorite books stories art pieces music movies or television shows. Students choose one of these examples and describe in writing the mathematical concept or theory it expresses. Teachers may need to help younger students with creating such metaphoric comparisons.Further Questions for Discussion:What are some examples of stereotypes about mathematicians and people who are interested in and good at doing math? How do movies and television promote these stereotypes?How does math apply to the profession that you want to pursue?What are some examples of mathematics employed in music?What are some examples of mathematics employed in dance?What is the relevance of mathematics in your daily life?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in classroom discussion and “mathematical metaphors in art” project.Vocabulary:dimunition derives peripheral discipline chaos theory trajectories intersect compression labyrinths symmetry geometry continuum abstract algebra profound intuitiveExtension Activities:1. Students interview a person who uses math in his or her occupation. Students should find out specifically how math is used in this occupation and obtain an example of a typical math problem (worked out to find a solution). This information can then be posted in the classroom.2. Study a famous mathematician or mathematical discovery and present this information to the class.3. Find another New York Times article dealing with mathematics in the “everyday” world to read and discuss with your classmates.Interdisciplinary Connections:Science: Relate perceptions and stereotypes of scientists to those of mathematicians. How are scientists portrayed in movies and on television? How are these media stereotypes similar? How are they different?Language Arts: Study the “mathematics of poetry” (specifically meter and rhyme schemes).Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmark: Understands that mathematicians often represent real things using abstract ideas like numbers or lines- they then work with these abstractions to learn about the things they represent.Art Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmark: Knows how various concepts and principles are used in the arts and disciplines outside the arts (e.g. balance shape pattern)Grades 9-12Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmarks: Understands that theories in mathematics are greatly influenced by practical issues- real-world problems sometimes result in new mathematical theories and pure mathematical theories sometimes have highly practical applications; Understands that mathematics provides a precise system to describe objects events and relationships and to construct logical arguments; Understands that mathematics often stimulates innovations in science and technologyArt Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmarks: Knows ways in which various art media can be integrated; Understands how elements materials technologies artistic processes and organizational principles are used in similar and distinctive ways in the various art formsThis lesson plan may be used to address the academic standards listed above. These standards are drawn from Content Knowledge: A Compendium of Standards and Benchmarks for K-12 Education; 3rd and 4th Editions and have been provided courtesy of the Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning in Aurora Colorado.

 5519,  1986, a, Wall Street professionals were big sellers as stockholders of the Union Carbide Corporation tendered shares last night to the big chemical company for an $85 package of cash and securities.Carbide shares meanwhile continued to climb in very busy trading yesterday while shares of the GAF Corporation which is trying to take over Carbide continued to slump. Carbide rose 37.5 cents yesterday to $70.875 with 4.7 million shares changing hands. The day before Carbide slid $1.125 to $70.50 on a volume of 3.5 million shares. Carbide topped the most-active list on both days.GAF which plunged $5.75 on Monday fell $3.50 yesterday to $59. Opposing a TakeoverCarbide which is fighting GAF's $74-a-share takeover bid is offering a package of $20 in cash plus $65 in bonds. But the offer is for just 35 percent of its shares and the company told shareholders to tender by midnight last night to qualify for proration. If Carbide gets more it will buy only what it wants on a prorated basis.Carbide is expected to announce the response to its offer early this month.Wall Street professionals sold from their holdings of about a third of Carbide's 67.6 milllion shares. Some however said they were worried that not enough others had offered their stock.
 3587,  1998, a, ''The glacier which covered much of the Northern Hemisphere reached its final southern limit on Staten Island'' said Edward Johnson curator of science at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. ''And when it retreated it left all these boulders kettle ponds a network of streams low hills and marshland.''To the Leni-Lenape tribe of the Algonquin Nation the island was called Aquehonga after the sandy banks of the southern shore. To the Dutch who first arrived in 1639 and promptly began pushing out the Indians it was Staaten Eylandt Island of the States -- the States being the name of the Dutch legislature.But to the English who came in large well-armed vessels in 1664 -- and promptly began pushing out the Dutch -- it was Richmond in honor of King Charles II's illegitimate son Charles Lennox the Duke of Richmond.It didn't take long for the English to consummate the island's first real estate deal. ''In 1670'' said Richard Dickenson the Staten Island Borough Historian ''Governor Thomas Lovelace purchased the island from the Indians.''''They had a different concept of what selling land was'' Mr. Dickenson said. ''To them everybody owned the land; nevertheless they went along with the charade.'' The price: an unknown quantity of coats kettles guns axes knives and wampum.In 1676 the tiny village of Tottenville at the southern tip of the island -- in fact the southern tip of New York State -- was first settled. And a century later on Sept. 11 1776 two months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence three members of the Continental Congress -- Benjamin Franklin John Adams and Edward Rutledge -- met with British Admiral Lord Richard Howe in what is now called the Conference House in Tottenville in an attempt to avert the Revolution. They didn't.In the 1800's village industries cropped up throughout South Richmond: fishing in Tottenville; brickmaking because of the fine clay in Charleston; oystering particularly by a group of free blacks from Maryland and Virginia along the western shore in Rossville. And that configuration of isolated towns with a few roads and farms between would hold as the pattern for development -- or more precisely limited development -- well into the 20th century.

 5234,  1988, a, The Mets staged their first full workout of spring training today and delivered some theater to their new audience on Florida's Gold Coast. Dwight Gooden pitched batting practice for the first time and fired the heater past sluggers like Gary Carter and Darryl Strawberry.It was a bit of old magic in a new setting and while it didn't count in anybody's batting or pitching records it did startle the fans and the players. This was a no-nonsense Gooden revving up for the first time this spring for the first time since he lost his bid for a raise in salary arbitration and took a $100000 cut instead.''He was overpowering'' Strawberry said. ''He looks a lot stronger this year. The way he threw today I'd have to say he's throwing more like the year when he won the Cy Young Award.''''I didn't think he was going to be throwing that hard the first time out but he was popping it'' Strawberry said.

 3338,  2000, a, In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges the clearinghouses for the two markets introduced a plan today that would cut settlement costs by 90 percent for certain trades.Brokers have expressed concern about the potential for escalating costs should the London and Frankfurt exchanges combine to form a pan-European bourse called iX. Winning the support of brokers is crucial for the London Stock Exchange in its attempts to ward off a hostile bid from OM Gruppen A.B. the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm stock exchange.''It's a good workable blueprint'' said Brian Mairs a spokesman for the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.While today's proposal went a long way toward addressing shareholder concerns questions about how the savings would be achieved and who would benefit the most underscore the difficulty that European stock exchanges were facing as they tried folding dissimilar technologies and regulations into one entity. A certain amount of overlap in terms of how trades are settled has led some shareholders of the London Stock Exchange to call the proposal a political Band-Aid rather than the most economically viable solution.
 6200,  1975, a, Investment Cut Seen“How anyone can look at 314 as a desirable solution is beyond me” says Bruce Lippke economist for the Weyerhaeuser Corporation the Northwest's giant forest products company. “Yet it's the first chance people have had to kick back. They're fed up with no help for the schools from the legislature and this is one way to vent their anger.“We are against it. But the initiative will probably pass because people are mad—and uninformed about the real consequences.”Then he adds: “Our investments could be reduced as much as 20 per cent depending on our cash flow.”Foes of the measure also say that the tax is “regressive” because corporations who do in ‐ state business such as grocery and retail stores will increase their prices and in effect consumers will pay the tax. They also contend that the tax will not cure the school ills as the measure will raise only half of current school requests and will not totally replace future school levies.Also receiving attention is the impact the tax would have on the flow of out‐of‐state investment funds; Initiative 314 applies a compensating tax to earnings of out‐of‐state corporations investing in Washington. Mortgage officials estimate that 50 to 70 per cent of funds for its industry come from out of state mainly the East and they say the tax could shut off that money.Gov. Daniel Evans has been quoted as having said the initiative contains a bombshell that has been little noticed—its effect on municipal‐bond interest rates. Such bonds are taxexempt under the Federal regulations but Initiative 314 would tax such interest.On a $100‐million bond issue the interest rate might be about 6 per cent. But under 314 one bond expert said any corporate buyers of the bonds would be required to pay the 12 per cent tax on the interest. Thus they would demand higher interest rate to purchase them perhaps 6.8 per cent. Taxpayers would pick up the extra cost which could run into millions.Backers of 314 however say that many such bonds are held by individuals and thus Would! not be subject to the tax.
 7521,  1964, a, THIS is Melvin Belli's defense of Melvin Belli who sees himself charged with losing one of the most celebrated murder cases of the 20th century —the trial of Jack Ruby for the shooting of President Kennedy's alleged assassin Lee Harvey Qswald. The book expresses the author's vengeance against the city in which the case was tried.Mr. Belli would seem to have a safe and in some circles a popular object of wrath. Since the 1930's Dallas has been a center of American reaction and political arrogance. This climate of conviction grew into active belligerence creating incidents before the Kennedy tragedy involving in 1960 Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife and in 1963 Adlai Stevenson U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations.Mr. Belli calls Dallas a “city of shame.” He writes of “the Dallas sickness” of “Dollar Dallas.” He says that “the surface sophistication of frontier Dallas could be summed up with what I had seen in one home a philodendron growing in a goldplated bidet.” He implies that Dallas scorns Ruby because he is a Jew.The Dallas condition is ascribed to “runaway materialism.” Such a distinction is hardly peculiar to Dallas. Mr. Belli's rage his acrimony shows him to be an incomparably graceless loser. Indeed he says toward the end of the book that he “should have realized . . . that in just having spoken against Dallas as I had I had pretty well killed my further usefulness to Jack in Texas. I would have fired me too had I been they” meaning the Ruby family.

 1319,  2011, a, So much has happened over the past few months. My feelings throughout this crazy milestone we call the college admissions process have changed entirely so many times that it’s difficult to keep track of them all.I started as an overwhelmed sophomore then transformed into a generally apprehensive junior. This year I began by experiencing myriad emotions all with varying degrees of pleasantness and some suspiciously similar to the Five Stages of Grief. Everything from stress sadness and frustration to excitement joy and ultimately acceptance.As time goes on and the whole crazy concept of moving out going to college and (gasp!) growing up looms closer I become less and less preoccupied with the fears and ecstasies of getting into all of my colleges and more pleased with the idea that no matter what I’m in. I am going to college.My nerves have been assuaged by developments over the past couple of months. First I was accepted to USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering and offered its Presidential Scholarship worth $21080 each year. In addition to that the program has repeatedly sent me packets of information and offers to apply to their various honors programs. Of course this is no guarantee that I would be accepted into any of them but I am grateful that USC has made that offer.Beyond that my Mom and I finished the Fafsa on time albeit narrowly. Though relatively simple to fill out the need to finish it has been nagging at both of our minds for awhile and it is a relief to have it out of the way.I also received news that I have been selected as a National Merit Finalist based on my PSAT score as well as an essay and SAT scores that I had to submit to the National Merit Scholarship Corporation back in September. The award opens up new scholarship opportunities for me. I still need to do some research on the colleges that offer scholarships for National Merit but the sums offered from many of them are considerable.However as with most things in life my good news is accompanied by disappointing news. MIT announced its admissions decisions — on Pi Day March 14 at 9:26 p.m. — which if you include the fact that my class will graduate in 2015 yields 3.1415926.I think it’s cute in a nerdy kind of way. Or at least I did until I read their decision.My initial reaction was numbness followed shortly by a vague sense of having been insulted. However as reason returned I had to remember that its pool of applicants is both large and extremely talented and that I ought not take it personally. Besides chocolate and good friends are the best sort of medicine for college heartbreak.My vexation over MIT was alleviated upon receiving further good news. I was accepted to Case Western and offered a scholarship there worth $17000 annually which is about half of its tuition. Finally I received word from Cornell University saying that I am accepted there too. I still have to wait for the admissions packet in the mail as well as any word about financial aid but I’m glad for the acceptance itself.I stress the scholarships (and their respective amounts) here because of the extreme importance of these factors in my final college decision. Even with financial aid many of the schools that I’m considering are still very expensive. The estimated cost including room and board books and tuition for a year at USC is $55728 according to the College Board.The full fees for Cornell Yale and Carnegie Mellon are similar so naturally my family and I are hoping for some assistance. Getting accepted to an elite school is not the only obstacle to actually being able to go there. On the bright side however most Ivy League and otherwise highly selective schools are aware that many of their applicants are in this situation. Consequently many of them offer generous need-based scholarships.As I approach the culmination of these past few years of stress and excitement I feel almost as confounded as when I began but for different reasons. Where I initially had no idea where to even begin looking to apply I have already heard back from every school but (as I write this) Yale and Carnegie Mellon.Now the trouble is weighing the costs and benefits of each school (its distance from home its price its programs…) and deciding which of them will truly work for me. So now my quandary while much less frenetic than it was earlier in the year is no less difficult to work through. Wish me luck.Ms. Ray is one of six seniors at Cherry Creek High School in Denver who will blogging about their college searches for The Choice between now and May.

 5768,  1985, a, As fire and smoke filled Grand Central Terminal Wednesday morning a major concern among fire officials was the potential for PCB contamination from burning electrical transformers.The Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Company 1 was called with the first alarm at 5:30 A.M. to monitor the situation and check for other chemical dangers.PCB's or polychlorinated biphenlys were used as coolants in electrical transformers before the Federal Government banned them in 1977. Many transformers in utility power circuits and electrified railway cars built before the ban however still contain the substance. At high temperatures it becomes a cancer-causing agent that can be spread by smoke and soot.Firefighters of the HazMat unit as the company is known were among the first to enter Wednesday's blaze which swept through 18 decrepit rail cars left in an underground storage yard.
 4025,  1996, a, ''If we don't get anywhere in committee'' he said ''then we'll try to take the fight to the floor. We think we have enough votes to do that for sure because all you need is a quarter of the platform committee or six state delegations.''In recent months Mr. Wilson and Mr. Weld have been in contact with other party moderates about the abortion issue among them Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Asked how many other governors and leading party moderates could be expected to join the fight for the substitute plank Mr. Wilson replied ''We'll begin to see now that we have a plank to propose.''Governor Whitman's office said she was on vacation in Alaska and would have no immediate comment.Mr. Wilson said that the Dole campaign was told earlier this week of the plan to offer the substitute but that ''I don't know what they intend to do with it.''Mr. Dole after considerable backing and filling recently tried to head off any embarrassing convention split on abortion. He proposed that the party retain its long-standing anti-abortion plank but also add a tolerance plank which would welcome party members who have ''deeply held and sometimes differing views on issues of personal conscience like abortion.''After the wording of the suggested substitute plank was released today the Dole campaign released the following statement: ''Bob Dole's long and consistent pro-life record is as strong as his belief that the Republican Party is an inclusive party. The issue of platform language is one that will ultimately be decided by the platform committee.''
 1456,  2010, a, Google like other leading technology companies funds university research in fields where its interest and the interest of science coincide. Until now the company has done that mainly with lots of smaller grants typically $50000 or so.But Google is stepping up its funding. In a focused approach to be announced on Tuesday the company is making a $5.7 million commitment to a dozen university research projects. The money is earmarked for four areas: machine learning the use of cellphones as data collection devices in science energy efficiency in computing and privacy.“We’ve identified four extremely important areas both to Google and to society” said Alfred Spector the company’s vice president of research and special initiatives.The unrestricted grants range in size from $100000 to $1.5 million and are for projects that usually span two or three years to complete. All of the recipients are universities in the United States other than one to Cambridge University.The program points to how Google’s research agenda has evolved and expanded. Three years ago three of the four research areas would not have been on the company’s priority list Mr. Spector said. The only one that was a priority then and now is machine learning a vital ingredient in search technology.Google didn’t have a cellphone operating system three years ago Mr. Spector said. Data center energy efficiency has become a technical challenge and environmental concern he said. And privacy too is a more pressing issue for Google as it has moved increasingly beyond searching the public Internet to also collecting personal data in its Gmail and calendar services for example.Three of the four research groups are in fields where Google could be said to be playing offense: Improvements in machine learning cellphone data collection and energy efficiency would all help boost the company’s profits.The fourth area — privacy — has more the look of defense: It is presumably in Google’s interest to promote the development of privacy-handling tools that forestall federal regulations. Four of the 12 research projects are in the field of privacy.One of privacy projects is at Carnegie Mellon University where a team led by Lorrie Faith Cranor is conducting technology-and-behavior research into what they call “privacy nudges.” Will people pay a bit more to purchase goods from Web sites that have tighter practices for handling personal data? Early work by the Carnegie Mellon team which includes Alessandro Acquisti and Norman Sadeh suggests that they will.More than half of the users in experiments Ms. Cranor said were willing to pay a bit more for goods on Web sites the researchers designated as having better privacy practices. The premium was about 60 cents on a $10 purchase. The percentage went even higher she noted when the research involved “privacy-sensitive products” such as condoms and sex toys.“We’re trying to understand how people make privacy decisions online and if there were easy-to-use privacy meters on Web sites how such tools would influence their decisions” Ms. Cranor said.

 3957,  1996, a, Over Democrats' objections a bill that would extend the state's authority to house its prisoners in county jails was approved yesterday by the Assembly. Joseph V. Doria Jr. the Assembly minority leader said the bill is unfair to counties because the state does not pay the full cost of incarcerating its inmates.Of the 27000 state inmates 4500 are in county jails and the number is growing said Chuck Leitgeib a spokesman for the Assembly's Republican majority. In separate action yesterday the Assembly passed a bill to give Camden County $5.9 million to build a 200-bed addition to its jail.
 5490,  1987, a, WHILE the new CBS series ''Tour of Duty'' continues tonight to exploit the Vietnam story with standard war games and buddy stories a made-for-TV movie on ABC at 9 P.M. makes a more oblique yet considerably more powerful attack on the same subject. ''Proud Men'' is set not in Vietnam but in the American Northwest. Charlton Heston plays Charley McLeod a weathered tradition-steeped cattle rancher who is told he is dying. His wife Laura (Nan Martin) phones their son an increasingly successful photographer in France to come home. Charley Jr. portrayed by Peter Strauss went AWOL 15 years earlier in Vietnam.Written by Jeff Andrus the script is uncomplicated. And the Von Zerneck-Samuels Production directed by William Graham is as attractively lean as an old-style western. But instead of trying to paper over a grueling experience with uplifting stories of battlefield heroics ''Proud Men'' confronts painful realities that linger in the national psyche. The older Charley still disapproves of what his son did. He is still ashamed that his son as he puts it ''cut and run.'' And Charley Jr. is just as convinced that ''the thing was absurd - I swore an oath to my country not to what was going on over there.'' Father and son are very much alike two proud men each convinced that he alone is right. Mr. Heston and Mr. Strauss bring them to life with strong and sensitive performances.''Proud Men'' is strewn with cliches. When for instance Charley reveals that he might cut his son out of his will Mom cries: ''This land has been in the McLeod family for three generations.'' But for the most part the more predictable moments are handled well. Upon his return Charley Jr. discovers that a good many people in the small town are not about to forget. There is much muttering about ''traitor'' and ''yellow-belly.'' But then there is the sweet old girlfriend already divorced who is willing to believe that Charley Jr. acted honorably although she was never in favor of those war protesters who seemed to be ''cheering for the other side.''When the older Charley takes a turn for the worse Charley Jr. sends to Paris for his French wife and young son. Needless to say the presence of his grandson a cowboy fan softens the old man considerably even if the youngster can't speak English. Taking the boy out on horseback Charley gives him a hot dog assuring him that ''you take a bite out of that and you'll start talking American.'' In the end the town toughs the ones making a big issue about Charley Jr.'s ''cowardice'' turn out to be nasty bigots against all ''outsiders.''

 3433,  1999, a, The Japanese Parliament passed a law in 1997 permitting doctors to remove organs from brain-dead patients provided that consent is obtained beforehand and compromised on the definition of death saying that brain-dead patients would be considered dead only if they had specified that they wanted to donate their organs. But the law had not been applied until today's heart transplant which is only the second in Japan's history.Dr. Juro Wada performed the first 31 years ago in an ambiguous legal environment and when the recipient died he was accused of murder. The furor deterred other doctors from attempting similar operations any transplants until the current law permitting transplants went into effect in October 1997.In the years since thousands of people have flown overseas to get transplants or have simply died. Many others simply died because they could not afford surgical procedures abroad or could not get organs overseas in time.Despite the new law many people still wait in vain for transplants because many Japanese remain reluctant to donate their organs. At least seven patients have died while on official waiting lists. In a survey released by the office of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi one-third of those asked said they would like to donate their organs. But only 2.6 percent of them had official donor cards.In the first stage of today's operation doctors at the Kochi Red Cross Hospital in western Japan removed the heart liver and kidneys from the brain-dead patient the nation's first legal organ donor who was in a coma after suffering a stroke and a brain hemorrhage. Details about the donor even sex and age are being kept confidential until after the funeral at the request of the family.

 5316,  1988, a, When Franklin Roosevelt nominated Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme Court in 1939 voices of the extreme right called Professor Frankfurter a Communist. They cited especially the fact that he was a member of a national committee of the American Civil Liberties Union.On Jan. 12 1939 Frankfurter himself appeared as a witness before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee: a break from the traditional practice of Supreme Court nominees. The questions begun by Senator William E. Borah Republican of Idaho focused on his association with the A.C.L.U.Frankfurter explained how the Civil Liberties Union had come into being after World War I a time of public hysteria about supposed radical plots. He had been a Federal prosecutor Frank-furter said and he knew about the dangers of power in official hands. He knew the need for ''a group of people whose special job it should be to be watchful [ of ] the Bill of Rights.''As an example of his role he said the A.C.L.U. had consulted him about whether to help the Ku Klux Klan when Boston officials tried to stop it from holding a parade. ''I said 'Of course civil liberty means liberty for those whom we do not like or even detest.' '' (He was surely paraphrasing a passage in one of his favorite opinions by Justice Holmes: ''If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought - not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.'') Senator Borah asked about the relationship of the A.C.L.U. to Communism.

 4434,  1993, a, They also succeeded because they took the Knicks out of their two-man game of Ewing and Starks and forced them to play fast-paced run-the-court basketball. And New Jersey didn't let up after jumping to a 52-43 halftime lead. Only 3 Rebounds for EwingEwing had 16 points and 3 rebounds 7 points and 9 rebounds below his average. Starks who had 13 points 3 below his average had three more rebounds than Ewing.New Jersey (31-24) also played some of its best defense of the season. Only Ewing Starks and Mason who had 14 points scored in double figures for the Knicks (36-18). Charles Oakley (6) and Charles Smith (7) were invisible while Greg Anthony scored just 5 points and shot two fabulous airballs.The Knicks who were routed in Detroit on Friday shot 35.9 percent from the field. The Nets who had shot less than 40 percent during their three-game losing streak shot 44.9 percent today."In the last few games we haven't been playing well" said Ewing. "It's embarrassing. We have to keep playing hard and go back to the drawing board. We didn't execute all of us. I didn't keep Chris Dudley off the boards."Nets Coach Chuck Daly recently had a talk with Dudley and told him to be like another star he has coached: Dennis Rodman king of the rebound. "He told me to go after the boards go after it" said Dudley. No. 1 vs. No. 2This game further sweetened the rivalry between the Knicks and the Nets -- who are in first and second place respectively in the Atlantic Division -- because it demonstrated that the Nets can win. The Knicks who now lead by five and half games had easily won the teams' first two meetings this season with New York just brutalizing the Nets in the second one.

 5918,  1983, a, If nobody complained why the convulsion? Because those paying more than their share of costs were not prevented from finding alternatives. Lured by new technology the F.C.C. starting in the late 50's gradually let competitors skim the cream from Ma Bell's commercial and long-distance services - the very ones that were subsidizing local rates. And when the ensuing antitrust actions led to a divorce of A.T. & T.'s long- and short-distance systems the F.C.C. had to find a way to replace the subsidies from long to short.Though every phone is billed locally most will still be served by several companies: Ma Bell's regional offspring and long-distance connectors like A.T. & T. and its competitors. The economically pure remedy would be to charge every phone line $7 more a month the amount of the old system's subsidy to local service. But that would ignite a rebellion against any change.So the F.C.C. decided to shift the burden gradually to charge business phones more than residential and to justify the higher charge by calling it a fee for ''access'' to the interstate system. This rationalization has gone down poorly with consumers trained to restrain their long-distance calls. And it has complicated the job of state regulators who may have to let local phone rates double in a decade. There are fears the increases will drive poorer families off the phone grid destroying the universal service that benefits everyone. Congress already feels pressure to preserve the subsidies from long-distance to short. What's wrong with that? The short answer is efficiency. Technology promises many new conveniences and savings through long-distance communication; society will reap the benefits only if costs are properly allocated. A further answer is that innovations like cable and satellites will make it easier for high-volume business communicators to bypass the phone network altogether; stick them with the subsidy and they'll soon be unreachable. The best answer is that a carefully planned reform need not threaten universal service while accurate pricing could produce billions in new benefits. The number of people who would drop phone service priced at full cost is probably very small; a tripling of rates tomorrow would leave the average family paying no more of its income for basic service than in 1950. And if Congress wants to protect the very poor the least distorting way is to subsidize their phones directly. Or state regulators could freeze the cost of a no-frills service for the poor. But the truer the price for everyone else the broader the social gain. Underpricing local calls may enrich a shut-in's communication with neighbors but it severely limits communication with grandchildren or friends far away. And artificially high long-distance prices raise the price of everything else: business calls that might cost $2 end up in a letter that costs $3.50 to type. Small change perhaps until it dawns that Americans make 300 billion telephone calls a year. Will price reform improve service? Not if rate increases are beaten down politically and local phone companies are left starving. But a gradual approach to real costs can yield ever more efficiencies. Much depends on the political skill and courage of regulators and the understanding of the public.

 1149,  2012, a, “I want to give credit to Tim Cook for this” said Dara O’Rourke associate professor of environmental and labor policy at the University of California Berkeley . “He’s admitting they’ve got problems.”Apple’s supply chain is a subject much closer to Mr. Cook than it was to his predecessor. Not long after Mr. Jobs returned to lead Apple in 1997 he hired Mr. Cook to clean up the manufacturing operations which were in disarray with bloated inventory that hurt its profits. Over more than a decade Mr. Cook helped transform Apple’s operations into the envy of the electronics industry with an array of partners mostly in Asia  able to efficiently pump out its latest products.In contrast to Mr. Cook Mr. Jobs never visited the factories in China where Apple’s products were made according to two people with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified to avoid antagonizing Apple.PhotoDuring the years when he was chief executive Mr. Jobs was never as directly engaged with Apple’s effort to audit its suppliers as Mr. Cook was according to a former Apple executive who declined to be identified. Still when Mr. Jobs learned of the more serious violations of its supplier code of conduct — instances where child labor was used for example — he was outraged this person said.Mr. Cook has spoken publicly of how his blue-collar roots growing up in Alabama gave him an early appreciation for factory work. “I spent a lot of time in factories personally and not just as an executive” Mr. Cook told investors at a conference in San Francisco in February. “I worked in a paper mill in Alabama and an aluminum plant in Virginia .”Some labor rights advocates though said they were not yet convinced that last week’s report about conditions in Foxconn factories would lead to meaningful improvements for workers saying that earlier promises of progress by Apple and its partners had not been fulfilled.“It looks like a pattern I’ve observed before” said Jeff Ballinger a global labor activist and researcher. “It’s a report to get you over and hopefully things will die down. It’s not very convincing.”Advertisement Continue reading the main storySince 2007 Apple has published annual reports with the results of audits of factories where its products are produced. But in the last several months under Mr. Cook’s watch the company has taken a bolder set of steps to prod its suppliers into making workplace improvements.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For the month of February Apple said that compliance figure rose to 89 percent from 84 percent in January.This year Apple also became the first technology company to join the Fair Labor Association and it invited the nonprofit global monitoring group to conduct inspections of its suppliers’ factories in China and elsewhere.PhotoLast week the group published the results of its first inspections of Apple’s supply chain citing numerous violations of Chinese labor laws and regulations at Foxconn factories including instances where workers exceeded the 60-hour workweek that is the association’s standard.Foxconn which is based in Taiwan  promised that by July 2013 its employees would no longer exceed the 49-hour workweek limit set by Chinese law. Workers will not see a pay decline because of corresponding wage increases Foxconn pledged.In a statement Apple said “Our team has been working for years to educate workers improve conditions and make Apple’s supply chain a model for the industry which is why we asked the F.L.A. to conduct these audits.”Apple has said it had made many improvements to factory conditions over the years. In 2008 for example company inspectors discovered a situation in which a supplier had forced foreign workers to give up their passports to factory managers effectively limiting their ability to leave their jobs. Apple demanded that the supplier unnamed in Apple’s annual report mentioning the incident return the passports to the workers.Other problems have been harder for Apple to eradicate. Even Mr. Cook conceded in his speech at the investor conference in February that Apple had consistently found that suppliers had violated the company’s overtime policies.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyDaniel Diermeier a professor at Northwestern University who studies reputation management says he believes the more aggressive stance by Apple toward factory conditions is the result of greater scrutiny of the company by media and advocacy groups at a time when there is also intense interest in Apple’s soaring share price and cash reserves. But he also believes Mr. Cook’s leadership has played a role in the changes.“I think he probably has a deeper understanding and this is more personal for him than it might be for other executives” Mr. Diermeier said.Some worker advocates say they are hopeful the changes that have occurred under Mr. Cook will lead to lasting improvements in the manufacturing of electronics products.“They have an opportunity to become the new face of sustainable production in the electronics sector” said Meg Roggensack senior adviser business and human rights at Human Rights First a nongovernmental organization. “They’re smart enough. They’re well capitalized enough.”

 4468,  1993, a, A BUSINESS thrives on publicity -- good publicity -- but not every one knows how to get it. The owner of a small business may serve as public relations person or may assign the duties to a subordinate who learns or fails to learn on the job. A medium-size to large business may have its own person or staff to handle publicity or may hire an outside agency.Publicity Builder a book-software combination from Jian formerly Tools for Sales of Los Altos Calif. amounts to a course in how to win editors and influence reporters. Every public relations person could benefit from the wisdom of admonitions like these:"A press release should rarely be longer than two pages.""Send a fax ONLY if the reporter requests it.""Always introduce yourself your company and your product; never assume the reporter remembers you."The book is an adaptation and expansion of "How to Publicize High Tech Products and Services" by Daniel S. Janal. This version applies to any kind of product or service although many of the examples are drawn from the computer field and computer-related companies. Mr. Janal is a former reporter and editor who has his own public relations agency. He also conducts training seminars in publicity.

 1515,  2010, a, Peter J. Henning follows issues involving securities law and white-collar crime for DealBook’s White Collar Watch.The Securities and Exchange Commission’s investigation of insider trading at Pequot Capital Management had almost as many twists as an episode of “Desperate Housewives.” Closed by the enforcement division staff it became the subject of a Senate investigation and a report by the S.E.C.’s inspector general reopened briefly and closed again and finally reopened and pushed forward after e-mail messages from a divorce case emerged two years later.The S.E.C. only began looking at trading by Pequot in 2005 including some well-timed investments in Microsoft in April 2001. When it takes that long to start reviewing trades evidence of how information may have been passed might not be available and the memories of witnesses can fade making it difficult to put together a case.About White Collar Watch Peter J. Henning writing for DealBook’s White Collar Watch is a commentator on white-collar crime and litigation. A former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division and then a prosecutor at the Justice Department he is a professor at the Wayne State University Law School. He is currently working on a book “The Prosecution and Defense of Public Corruption: The Law & Legal Strategies” to be published by Oxford University Press.In the Pequot case the key e-mail messages were on the personal computer of the accused source of the information and would have remained out of sight had it not been for that person’s former wife disclosing them. That’s even better than any nighttime drama.Pequot and its chief executive Arthur J. Samberg settled with the S.E.C. by agreeing to pay nearly $28 million as disgorgement and a penalty without admitting or denying liability for trading in advance of a favorable earnings announcement from Microsoft. A former Microsoft employee hired by Pequot right around the time of the trading David E. Zilkha was named in an administrative complaint filed by the S.E.C. as being the source of the information.The initial investigation of Pequot involved trading in a number of different companies not just Microsoft and was closed in 2005. The S.E.C. staff attorney conducting the investigation Gary Aguirre was terminated shortly before the first closure of the investigation and there was a major controversy about whether the testimony of John J. Mack an influential Wall Street executive who is now chairman of Morgan Stanley should have been taken as part of the case unrelated to the Microsoft transactions. A subpoena had been issued for him to testify but it was subsequently withdrawn.At a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in December 2006 Mr. Aguirre contended that the S.E.C. closed the investigation of Pequot because of outside influences. A subsequent Senate report in August 2007 castigated the enforcement division for how it conducted the investigation and a report by the S.E.C. inspector general raised questions about contacts with outside counsel during the investigation although it found nothing improper in the decision to close the Pequot inquiry.The S.E.C. did reopen the Pequot investigation briefly in 2006 and took testimony from Mr. Mack and then closed the case again. It remained dormant until early 2009 when it received from Mr. Zilkha’s ex-wife the e-mails stored on the hard drive of his computer that he had received from another Microsoft employee telling him about the company’s positive earnings back in April 2001.While the S.E.C. had some e-mail traffic from Mr. Samberg to Mr. Zilkha asking for any information about Microsoft Mr. Zilkha had denied contacting anyone at the company during this period. In response to subpoenas for any communications about Microsoft the S.E.C. claims he did not produce the e-mails that his ex-wife subsequently revealed. Without any evidence to contradict his statement the enforcement division could not make a case because just asking for inside information is not a violation of the securities laws.How the S.E.C. came to receive the e-mails is shrouded in some mystery. Mr. Aguirre claims that he received them from Mr. Zilkha’s ex-wife through an anonymous source in December 2008 and turned them over to Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania (who had conducted the earlier hearing into the Pequot investigation) the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the S.E.C. chairman at the time Christopher Cox. The S.E.C.’s filing against Mr. Zilkha only states that the enforcement division “was provided copies of the Spain E-mails which had been located on a computer hard drive that was then in the possession of Zilkha’s ex-wife.”Mr. Zilkha had threatened to file a complaint against Pequot for his termination only a few months after being hired in 2001 basing his claim on having provided valuable information about Microsoft. Pequot and Mr. Zilkha reached a settlement before filing the case in court but it came to light as part of the divorce proceedings.The S.E.C. filed its settled complaint against Pequot and Mr. Samberg in Federal District Court in Connecticut but it chose to pursue the case against Mr. Zilkha in an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge. The vast majority of insider trading cases are brought in federal court and it is interesting to consider why the S.E.C. chose the administrative route for Mr. Zilkha yet another twist in the case.Unlike a federal court action which is governed by the liberal discovery rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure there is only limited discovery in an administrative proceeding. Depositions of witnesses are limited and a party cannot freely issue subpoenas for documents it wishes to obtain. The discovery process is controlled by the administrative law judge and is usually much more limited because it is a streamlined process.In the hearing itself the Federal Rules of Evidence are not applied which can present the S.E.C. with an advantage. While Mr. Samberg would appear to be an important witness the S.E.C.’s enforcement division may be able to present its case without having to call him perhaps using his investigative testimony and the settlement to show the Microsoft trades were based on inside information.According to the filing against Mr. Zilkha he asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to questions about Pequot’s trading and not disclosing the e-mails later revealed by his ex-wife. This can be used as evidence to establish his violation unlike in a criminal case where an assertion of the privilege cannot be mentioned. In an administrative proceeding this may carry even greater weight because the administrative law judge will have a stronger grasp of how this helps the S.E.C. meet its burden of proof.There is also the perception that the S.E.C. has a bit of a “home field” advantage in an administrative proceeding unlike in federal court where it must face a judge who may be skeptical of its claims. Pequot was a registered investment advisory firm so the S.E.C. can obtain the full range of remedies against Mr. Zilkha based on his association with it. If the S.E.C. proves its case then the administrative law judge can order a civil penalty and issue a cease-and-desist order against him pretty much what the commission would get in a federal court.After five years of an off-again/on-again investigation the S.E.C. finally brought the Pequot case to a close. Whether it can make its case against Mr. Zilkha remains to be seen but it has been a memorable trip regardless of the outcome.— Peter J.

 7524,  1964, a, HOUSTON Nov. 30 — The New York Yankees finally upstaged the New York Mets today by drafting Dulce Carmel the hard‐hitting first baseman and outfielder of the Mets’ No. 1 farm club Buffalo.Carmel was the Yankees’ only choice among four “senior” minor leaguers claimed by bigleague teams for $25000 fees at the formal opening of organized baseball's winter meeting.The 20 big‐league teams then drafted a record number of 59 first‐year players at $8000 each from one another's farm clubs with the Yankees and Mets taking one each. The Yankees chose Eliseo Rodriguez an 18-year‐old catcher from the Bronx. The Mets with room for only one new player on their bulging roster.” drafted Bob Nash a 20-year‐old outfielder from Wellsville in the New York‐Pennsylvania League.The Kansas City Athletics were the first to draft a player for $25000. They picked Jim Dickson a 26-year‐old righthander who compiled a 9-3 won‐lost record last season with the San Diego Padres and had been up briefly with the Houston Colts in 1963.
 2968,  2002, a, Colorado traded outfielder Todd Hollandsworth and the left-hander Dennys Reyes to Texas for outfielder Gabe Kapler and the prospect Jason Romano an infielder and outfielder.In a trade between noncontenders Pittsburgh sent outfielder Chad Hermansen to the Cubs for outfielder Darren Lewis.On Tuesday Phillips put the odds of making a trade as even but he worked feverishly to tilt things in his favor. The Mets were still involved in discussions with the Giants for starter Liván Hernández who would have been a more significant acquisition than Thomson. But the Giants never made a firm offer. The Giants inquired about reacquiring Shawn Estes but the Mets would have had to pay for some of the remainder of his $6.2 million salary this season.The Mets spoke with the Expos about Cliff Floyd although they were unwilling to trade the prospects Aaron Heilman and Jose Reyes for him. Floyd went to Boston. The Mets spoke to the Tigers about outfielder Robert Fick in another prospect-laden deal.But Phillips was unable to add an outfielder and ''we needed to get pitching'' he said. Phillips focused on Thomson another pitcher with a live arm whose career has been set back by injuries and by the hitter-friendly Coors Field. Thomson 28 has been on the disabled list four times in his career once for a blister on his right middle finger and three times for shoulder injuries. He missed all of the 2000 season after having surgery to repair a torn labrum and was twice sidelined upon his return last season.Thomson is 7-8 with a 4.88 earned run average in 21 starts this season. Pedro Astacio who learned to pitch at Coors Field has been one of the Mets' best starters this season and Phillips said he hoped Thomson would thrive after leaving Colorado. But Thomson has actually pitched better at home (4.50 E.R.A.) than on the road (5.94 E.R.A.) this season.Thomson will make his Mets debut in D'Amico's spot on Sunday. D'Amico will go to the bullpen where he has one career appearance in 95 major league games.

 4428,  1993, a, IN the issue's first day of trading in December the six million common shares of Hospitality Franchise Systems rose $2.75 from the initial public offering price of $16. And the company the worldwide franchiser of Days Inn and Howard Johnson and the franchiser of Ramada in the United States shows no signs of cooling off.The stock closed Friday at $24 on the New York Stock Exchange up 37.5 cents. Michael G. Mueller the lodging industry analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco said he expected continued high performance."I'm projecting earnings of $1.16 in calendar 1993 and going to $1.45 in 1994" Mr. Mueller said. That projection assumes little or no improvement in occupancy and room rates. "If you assume occupancy up 2 points and room rates up 3 percent" Mr. Mueller said "and assume they add 30000 rooms to the system instead of 17000 the company earns $1.68."Mr. Mueller's forecast is based on three main considerations: the company has continued to add rooms aggressively; it generates sizable excess cash flow and has minimal capital spending requirements and it will benefit from the expiration of many royalty rates that the previous management discounted to attract franchisees. These rates are the fees based on a percentage of revenue that franchisees pay to the company.

 923,  2013, a, PhotoMillions of immigrants head to the United States each year. And millions more would if they could get a visa. Yet more and more Americans complain of a sense that the cards are stacked against the middle class — and more devastatingly its children.It’s not just sky-high college costs especially compared with Western European universities or the substantial difference between the amount of state support in Europe and the United States of everything from health care to child care to education — whether Europe’s social generosity is sustainable over the long term or not.Many Americans — both in the United States and abroad — are concerned that the heart of the American Dream the belief that as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice often puts it in America “it doesn’t matter where you come from but where you’re going” is less and less true.A provocative set of statistics in a column by the New York Times opinion contributor Steven Rattner makes the case.Over the last decade or two the American middle has been hollowed out with an affluent well-educated class growing on one side of the divide and a poor and working-class majority on the other faced with limited opportunities to change their circumstances.Not unlike the view that many Americans have of a traditional European lack of social and economic mobility: if your father was a farmer or a factory worker chances are you will be a farmer or a factory worker.One of the most eye-popping statistics reported by Mr. Rattner is that 93 percent of all income growth in the U.S. in 2010 went to the top 1 percent of Americans. And 37 percent went to the top .01 percent. He writes:Also astonishing: just 15000 households received 37 percent of all of those income gains. In no other period in recent American history have economic gains been concentrated so disproportionately in an elite sliver.And the tax-and-spending deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff does little to slow America’s increasing wealth disparity.What do you think? What is the future of the American Dream? Whether you are an immigrant an expat or a global citizen do you believe in the American Dream? Is there something different about the United States than other societies? Has the once-American dream been exported to developing nations and their growing middle classes?

 4919,  1990, a, The agent in charge of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration in New York City and a top undercover agent for it are leaving the D.E.A. with harsh words about Federal drug policy saying that it is ill conceived and that the Government's operations abroad are futile.Both men who are retiring after 25 years as Federal agents said they had long harbored objections to the way several Administrations in Washington had attacked the drug problem but had been unable to speak out publicly while in Government service.Robert M. Stutman who retires today as special agent in charge of the 500-agent D.E.A. office in New York City said the Bush Administration's emphasis on stopping drugs at the borders and on paramilitary operations abroad had not stemmed the flow of drugs into the nation's neighborhoods.In an interview on Monday Mr. Stutman who is 46 years old said leaders in Washington are underfinancing drug-treatment and drug-education programs because he said they consider them to be undramatic policies that can show results only over the long term and that do not have the immediate political appeal of ''agents knocking down doors and aircraft carriers off the coast of Colombia.''

 3069,  2001, a, In a historic speech in Prague in 1990 as Communism in Eastern Europe was crumbling Secretary of State James Baker called for international support for independent broadcasting in the emerging states of the collapsing Soviet Union. Since then the need for independent news outlets of all kinds has become even more urgent -- in fledgling democracies and old regimes alike.That is why President George W. Bush and policymakers at the State Department and Pentagon should put American support for uncensored news outlets -- and unfettered access to the Internet -- at the top of their foreign policy agenda.Nothing raises more fear in a repressive regime than challenges to the control of information. And nothing is more important to the development of a civil democratic society. Free elections may be a first step in establishing the rule of law but there can be no multiparty elections without a multiplicity of news outlets. Yet press freedom especially in broadcasting remains threatened in many former Soviet and East Bloc countries while in China the democratizing power of the Internet is stalled.In Russia the recent government prosecution of Vladimir Gusinsky -- whose influential television network has criticized the war in Chechnya and President Vladimir Putin's handling of the Kursk submarine tragedy -- is an ominous sign of what may be in store for the hundreds of smaller independent TV stations now in Russia many of which have benefited from American aid.

This is what they were saying:In Iowa Reporting on candidates and voters from the Hawkeye State.Mitt Romney in Atlantic:“I’ll let people make their own assessment of our respective records but I’m a conservative.”“I’m proud to be a conservative businessman and what distinguishes me I think from others in the field is that I understand the economy first-hand having lived in it.”“And I think that the people of this country recognize that with our economy as the major issue we face right now that it would be helpful to have someone who understands the economy first-hand who spent the bulk of his career working in the private sector.”Newt Gingrich was in Marshalltown where he talked about his opponents Rick Santorum Gov. Rick Perry of Texas Mr. Romney and Representative Michele Bachmann:“If you count Santorum and Perry and Bachmann and me compared to the Romney numbers it’s going to be overwhelming that the conservative base of the party is still there and that Governor Romney remains basically a Massachusetts moderate. He has not broken out despite spending millions of dollars and as we go on in New Hampshire and South Carolina and Florida those numbers will ultimately prove decisive in the race.”“I think New Hampshire is the perfect state to have a debate over Romneycare and a debate about tax-paid abortions which he signed.”Mr. Santorum talking to supporters in Sioux City:“This is the most important election in our lifetime. This is a decision as to what kind of America you are going to hand to your children and grandchildren. Are you going to leave an America that is more and more dependent on bigger and bigger government to do the things families and churches and local communities should do?”Representative Michele Bachmann in Oskaloosa:“Who stands for marriage between a man and a woman? Who stands for life and the protection of human life from conception to natural death not just to be politically popular but who really means it? And who’s going to do something about it?”“I am not a politician. I am not an establishment person. I am a real authentic Iowan.”“I believe I’m the best person to take on Barack Obama and defeat him.”

 1600,  2010, a, In the United States and in France investors have swooped in and bought big stakes of companies without anyone knowing Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column this week. Given the importance of transparency in the markets he asks shouldn’t something be done about these legal if aggressive maneuvers?Big Investors Appear Out of Thin AirBy ANDREW ROSS SORKINAbout a week ago Bernard Arnault’s fashion empire LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton surprised the French establishment by announcing that it had acquired a 17 percent stake in Hermès International. Two weeks earlier Bill Ackman the activist hedge fund investor and Vornado Realty Trust the real estate company shocked Wall Street when they disclosed that they had acquired a nearly 27 percent stake in J.C. Penney the mass-market retailer.But hold on a minute: how is it possible that these corporate raiders were able to accumulate such large positions without anyone knowing?In the United States — and in France — regulators require all investors to disclose anytime they accumulate more than a 5 percent ownership stake in a company. The rule in the United States known as 13D along with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act which requires activist investors to disclose when they invest more than about $60 million is meant to provide the markets with a sense of transparency so that certain investors cannot just sneak up out of nowhere.And yet that is exactly what seems to be happening.Mr. Ackman took advantage of a rule giving investors 10 days to disclose their position after breaking the 5 percent ownership threshold. In his case once he passed the threshold he and Vornado sprinted to buy up tens of millions of shares before having to show their hand.Mr. Arnault’s approach was perhaps more insidious: he used derivatives to build up a stealth position in Hermès starting in 2008 so that he would not have to declare ownership until he was ready to pounce.It is all legal. But the real question is Should it be?“Unless and until lawmakers and securities regulators in the U.S. adopt disclosure requirements in accord with what is now the global consensus toward full and fair disclosure of equity derivatives and other synthetic and nonstandard ownership and control techniques U.S. corporations are well advised to adopt such self-help measures as are available” Adam O. Emmerich and William Savitt partners at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz wrote in a note to clients.Corporate boards have removed many of their defenses like poison pills in the last several years as part of efforts to be more open and democratic under pressure from shareholders and powerful advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services.But the 13D rule and others like it have not been updated in decades. Years ago in an age before e-mail a 10-day grace period for disclosure might have made sense; today it makes less. In Britain for example the rules are much stricter: investors have just 48 hours to declare passing a 3 percent threshold making it virtually impossible to build up a large stake without the markets having fair warning.The use of derivatives to create stealth positions is even more worrisome. In 2008 I wrote about this topic when Jana Partners a hedge fund used a series of swaps to buy a 21 percent stake in CNet. Since then other examples have emerged: A judge ruled that the Children’s Investment Fund had improperly used derivatives to influence the vote in a proxy contest involving CSX the railroad company. The judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the practice “permits a long party to ambush an issuer with a holding far greater than 5 percent.”In the case of LVMH’s ambush of Hermès Mr. Arnault explained in a filing that his company had acquired contracts on financial futures called equity swaps in 2008 “on the equivalent of 5 million and 4.8 million shares of Hermès whose deadlines were set between January and May 2011.” Then LVMH through subsidiaries “entered into amendments to these contracts so that they would receive physical delivery of underlying securities.”It is a clever gambit. And it does not appear to have skirted any law.A spokesman for LVMH Jim Fingeroth of Kekst & Company declined to comment. In a strange twist Mr. Fingeroth also happens to represent J.C. Penney; he declined to comment on its behalf as well.There is another side to this story. In speaking with a handful of investors’ activists who have employed some of these practices themselves — and refused to comment on the record for obvious reasons — it is clear that if the government reduced the 10-day period that investors had to disclose their positions after passing 5 percent these investors would not seek to take such stakes because it would be too expensive.Other investors rarely complain about stealth accumulation because it typically benefits them. During the 10-day period that Mr. Ackman and Vornado raced to buy up shares of J.C. Penney the company’s shares rose 45 percent. If you believe in shareholder democracy and in what many of these activists do is press for changes on management and within boards and they argue that placing higher barriers to ownership would make them less likely not more to pursue change.“No one would be able to build a stake in anything” one activist investor said. “We think we’re ultimately good for the capital markets.”True. But given the ultimate push for more transparency in the markets it seems like a conversation that regulators should consider having.Go to Previous DealBook Column »

 3404,  1999, a, Oh and don't worry about him taking his time mulling over script ideas. He said that the company was already planning to shoot a movie version of the play ''Hospitality Suite'' and that he expected to direct what he called ''a bigger more personal story maybe in a year or so.'' Some movies he may just produce without appearing in front of or behind the camera he said.''I wanted to do something that wasn't a vanity deal'' said Mr. Spacey referring to the fact that many studios offer successful actors production arrangements that actually generate few if any movies. ''There's a real opportunity for my company to become a player.''The company's deal with Fine Line Cinema a unit of Time Warner's New Line allows him to retain foreign distribution rights on some of his films and to create over time a library of movies in which he will own a substantial interest.''I'm interested in walking down roads I haven't walked down before'' Mr. Spacey said.At this busy time in his career it is striking though that he is currently appearing in ''Hurlyburly'' a movie that represents an unusually well-trodden road. As Mr. Spacey noted when he made the leap from regional theater to the New York stage some years ago it was by acting in ''Hurlyburly.''In fact he said he played almost every part in the dark drama before the run was through and his career had begun. In the film he plays the smooth reptilian Mickey.

 3197,  2001, a, But Darrell Nixon 43 said he welcomed the renewed attention to the homicides.''Justice should be done'' Mr. Nixon said. ''It'll put people at ease. Regardless of the outcome we need to put this to rest so people can begin to forgive and forget.''For years a portrait of Officer Schaad with his blond cowlick has hung in the police station here. His father was a police officer and he had been on the job only 10 months when he became the only York policeman ever killed in the line of duty. He died at 22 two weeks after he was shot.Charged with his murder on Tuesday were two men with long criminal histories: Donald Freeland 49 who is in state prison on a drug conviction and Leon Wright 53. According to an affidavit witnesses told the grand jury that Mr. Freeland boasted about firing a steel-piercing .30-.40 Krag rifle at the armored van in which Officer Schaad was riding. A preliminary hearing has been set for Nov. 9.Mayor Robertson who decided not to seek re-election earlier this year admits that he was a racist police officer in 1969 and that he yelled ''White power!'' at a rally the night before Ms. Allen was killed. But he has denied any involvement in her death which occurred by shotgun blast after a large group of white men surrounded her family's car.Four prosecutors and four detectives spent two years trying to solve the Allen and Schaad cases. Because there was distrust among blacks prosecutors said they first tried to solve the Allen case hoping that witnesses would then come forward to identify Officer Schaad's killer.Why did witnesses cooperate now? ''Time guilt'' said Bill Graff York County's chief deputy prosecutor. ''When things happened 30 years ago most just lied then. We're talking 17-  18-  19-year-old kids. Time moves on. They're in their 50's now.''They know what they saw; they know what they did. Guilt has a lot to do with it. There have been eight suicides in these cases over 30 years. A lot of drug and alcohol problems. That's a heavy guilt to carry.''

Pataki made his first comments about Ms. Stubbs on Monday night saying he knew of "all that she does to help Libby with all of her political events that are very helpful" and was not aware of any impropriety."Libby has done a tremendous service not just in helping me politically and not just in so many of her governmental events but also in what she has done to help candidates to help our party -- the most recent one being all that she did to help and to attend events and to host events and to speak at the national convention -- and I'm proud of that" Mr. Pataki said at a brief news conference in Albany after speaking to the state's Conservative Party.Mrs. Pataki wears a number of hats. As first lady she travels the state and speaks about issues like domestic violence. The governor's office arranges her travel for her official duties officials said.

 204,  2018, a, Those and a few chairs are just about the only props you’ll find in Mr. Cummings’s production. As the artistic director of Transport Group he is known for minimalist or essentialist stagings like an endearing unisex version of “I Remember Mama” in 2014. Doing more with less is also the house style of Classic Stage under John Doyle who has revived musicals as different as “Sweeney Todd” and “The Color Purple” by depriving them of distracting stagecraft.But this “Summer and Smoke” has been scraped too close to the bone. Dane Laffrey’s big white shoe box or coffin of a set conveys all too well Alma’s empty prospects but offers nothing to suggest either the suffocating trap of her Victorian circumstances or the richness and romance of her imagination. Her statue of Eternity is not even stone; it’s a framed photograph.Williams specified minimalism — no doors or windows — but he meant something more poetic by it. In his production notes he refers to de Chirico and Renaissance paintings as a way of suggesting the natural world Alma must finally embrace. Which is not to say “Summer and Smoke” is hopeful; Alma and John convert each other too late ending up once again on opposite sides of love. But it mustn’t play out its bleakness too soon or there’s nothing to lose and thus no drama.Ms. Ireland’s imagination is so well calibrated that she manages almost single-handedly to correct for that distortion. If this “Summer and Smoke” were performed silently you could still understand the story from her physicalization of Alma’s character. More than that her manic laughter gulping breaths and drooping shocks are carried off with such authenticity that they reframe hysteria as a natural even brave response to deprivation and constant insult.But of course a silent performance would not be Williams and if much of the dialogue has a high butterfat content Ms. Ireland delivers it naturally. Mr. Darrow properly dashing and tortured as John hasn’t quite achieved that facility; his emphasis on the character’s self-loathing and cynicism sometimes makes him seem hollow instead of harrowed.Williams is partly to blame. John’s feelings for Alma aren’t as clear as hers are for him and he often hovers like the rest of the residents of Glorious Hill — especially the stereotypically “passionate” Mexican family that runs the local casino — on the verge of caricature. Williams tried to solve these problems with massive rewriting; the result was “The Eccentricities of a Nightingale” which puts the main characters in a rather different framework.“Eccentricities” is an improvement but “Summer and Smoke” is nevertheless Williams with veins of rich pathos to be mined from its melodrama. Surely its central question remains profound: Why do we fall in love with a person’s struggle instead of with the person himself? If this revival doesn’t address that question convincingly except in its central performance I don’t blame the cast which also features Tina Johnson as the local busybody Ryan Spahn as a traveling salesman and Hannah Elless as a pupil of Alma’s who turns out to be a rival.No it’s the parsimony of the production that’s at fault offering little that’s lovely except Michael John LaChiusa’s original music in an apt neoclassical mode. Perhaps it’s fitting that music should be the one element that gives you a taste of what this “Summer and Smoke” might have been with such an eloquent Alma if it hadn’t like her spent so much energy stifling its passion.
 940,  2013, a, PhotoStaten Island Chuck lives the pampered life one would expect of a celebrity groundhog lounging in a heated nursery at the Staten Island Zoo and noshing on sweet potatoes as the world outside shivers.But as Chuck gears up to make a weather prediction Saturday alongside heavily gloved handlers and politicians his wild counterparts occupy the proverbial other side of the tracks.Meet the Real Groundhogs of New York City a population of perhaps a few dozen scattered throughout city parks botanical gardens and cemeteries some so isolated from any other groundhog community that naturalists do not know for sure how they got there.Right now of course they are sound asleep as groundhogs are meant to be in midwinter (the greenhouse conditions in Chuck’s lair throw his hibernation software out of whack). When the weather warms though they emerge from burrows all over: Astoria Park in Queens Conference House Park at the bottom of Staten Island and Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx.Sunny Corrao a ranger with the parks department recommended Fort Tryon Park at the relatively wild northern top of Manhattan particularly the lawns just west of the heather garden and those along Broadway for sightings.“You’re almost guaranteed to see groundhogs” said Ms. Corrao who regularly shows them off to passers-by through her binoculars and spotting scope.PhotoGroundhogs also can be found in Central Park hemmed in on all sides by concrete that poses a riddle as to their origin. The population there has been very small for a long time and possibly nonexistent some years leading naturalists to doubt that groundhogs have survived there since before the park was cut off from other green space in the 19th century.David Burg president of the urban conservation group WildMetro theorized that groundhogs in Central Park and other city greenswards were dumped there — or descend from groundhogs dumped there — by frustrated gardeners who trapped them.“Big parks in urban areas very often get nuisance animals released” Mr. Burg said.Some of the groundhogs in the Bronx may be descendants of Project X a parks initiative during the Giuliani administration meant to bring back native species. In 1997 groundhogs were reintroduced in Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.Other groundhogs in the northern Bronx might have followed grass-lined roads like the Hutchinson River Parkway. Possibly a groundhog or two managed to navigate the streets much the same way the city’s raccoons do and cross a bridge into Manhattan.“Teenage males are capable of many things” said Robert S. Voss a mammal curator at the American Museum of Natural History. “But it would be very very high risk” because groundhogs unlike raccoons are active during the day when car dog and human traffic is the highest. They also move slowly and rarely venture far from their burrows or the green vegetation they consume in prodigious quantities.Yet another challenge facing New York City’s groundhogs: their populations are so small and separated from one another some probably have trouble finding mates naturalists say.PhotoOne balmy Wednesday in January Matthew Wills who writes the urban nature blog Backyard and Beyond ventured into Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn to show a reporter a burrow dug into a hill beneath a big family tombstone. He waited patiently for a while but the groundhog did not show itself. In the breeze it almost seemed as if faint snoring could be heard from within.Mr. Wills recalled that he had seen a groundhog in the cemetery on two occasions.The first time was in the spring of 2011. The second was last fall. He had just finished a participatory art project when he saw a whiskered face pop up among the gravestones.“It was like seeing an old friend” Mr. Wills said. “I would hope there’s more than one.”
 821,  2014, a, McNEAL--Philip Webster beloved husband father son and friend passed away on May 27 2014. Philip was born in St. Louis Missouri on December 6 1953. The only child of the late Senator Theodore McNeal and his wife Virgie Philip was named after American labor movement giants A. Philip Randolph and Milton Webster. The elder McNeal worked with both men to organize the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters the most prominent predominantly black labor union of its day. In 1976 Philip graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering from University of Missouri Rolla and began his career at Exxon Mobil as a project engineer. In 1984 Philip joined J.P. Morgan as an investment banker in the firm's Natural Resources and Power Group and later Managing Director and Senior Client Advisor. Philip met his true love Glenda Goodly and they married in 1989. They enjoyed a rare enviable partnership of equals who not only loved but also truly respected each other. They were blessed with two wonderful children - daughter Sydney and son Carter. Despite his demanding career Philip was active in his community serving as a longtime board chair of the Montclair Human Needs Food Pantry former trustee of Montclair Kimberley Academy and trustee of Newark Academy. But at the very center of his life was his devotion to Glenda Sydney and Carter. He cherished each of them and their time together as a family. Philip found absolute contentment immersed in a finite set of passions: St. Barths boating Long Beach Island and his circle of extended family and friends. They comprised an endless stream of precious memories punctuated by the unforgettable expression on Philip's face when Glenda surprised him with a 60th birthday party in January 2014. Soon after Philip was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Philip's battle to the end with this devastating disease was marked by the same integrity clarity and steadiness of spirit he embodied in his work and personal life. Philip passed away at home surrounded by those he loved most on the eve of his and Glenda's 25th wedding anniversary. Thoughtful and generous to his core Philip would want the battle against pancreatic cancer to continue in the form of funding research so that others might be spared what he endured. A fund has been established in his honor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He is survived by Glenda Sydney and Carter; his mother Virgie half-brother Theodore McNeal Jr. and an extended family that loved him dearly. Few are as stellar in life as they are claimed to be in memory; Philip McNeal was and he will remain so in our hearts forever. Memorial service will be held on Monday June 2nd at 6pm at the Morgan Library 235 Madison Avenue New York New York.

 3779,  1997, a, The competitive revolution in telecommunication took two encouraging steps forward this week. News Corporation announced a merger that promises to provide its customers with a broadcast satellite service fully equal if not superior to their local cable service. AT&T the long-distance carrier then announced that it had secretly developed a technology that would allow it to bring local phone service to people's homes without using the equipment of the regional Bell companies.The key in both cases is wireless communication. News Corporation which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and AT&T are threatening to break the monopoly choke hold of their competitors by sending their services over the air rather than laying fabulously expensive wires into everyone's home.News Corporation will invest $1 billion in a new service with Echostar Communications a small satellite broadcaster. The combined facilities will offer homes across most of the country a video service that includes hundreds of channels of high-resolution TV C.D.-quality sound and something that no other satellite service has so far been able to provide -- signals from at least some local television stations. Because satellite services have lacked local channels they have lured too few cable customers to keep cable rates down. By offering satellite customers local channels News Corporation will give households the option of saying goodbye to their local cable monopolies.AT&T also plans to bring its service into the home over the air rather than through a wire. The wireless technology will broadcast phone calls from towers directly to a radio box attached to the home. From there the call will travel through phone lines and equipment that already exist in everyone's home.
 5355,  1988, a, Ms. Recht was arrested this afternoon and charged with making false statements to a Federal agency a crime that carries a potential maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250000 fine.The Federal authorities would not say whether they knew why Ms. Recht 34 years old had falsified the threats or whether any of those reported were in fact the work of others. The authorities would also not say when she had started falsifying the threats or how many she had falsified.The housing plan was ordered by a Federal judge as a partial remedy for four decades of what the court found to be intentional segregation in education and housing. The judge ordered the building of 200 units of low-income housing and 800 units of moderate-income housing in mostly white neighborhoods.Soon after the angry Council session Ms. Recht became the focus of newspaper articles and television programs as a voice of compliance and accommodation to the plan which continues to split the city. In May she was honored by the College of New Rochelle for her role in the case. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters as the ''lone voice of reason'' seeking civil discourse in the city. The ceremony was two weeks after she received a B.A. summa cum laude from the State University of New York at Purchase.Throughout the year Ms. Recht complained to the police and F.B.I. that she was receiving telephoned death threats and suffering the painting of swastikas and threats outside her apartment door. The actions continued she said even after she had her telephone number changed and unlisted.
 2777,  2003, a, To the Editor:The analysis of Supreme Court voting patterns showing that the members vote more like five independent justices rather than nine seems to be based upon the flawed idea that ideally their votes should be completely independent (''A Mathematician Crunches the Supreme Court's Numbers'' June 24).But since they are judging rather than casting independent or random ballots their votes should generally tend to be consistent.Nine people judging a skating competition are all likely to award high marks to the best competitor and low marks to the worst competitor because each is exercising judgment as to how well a skater meets various established criteria.Similarly Supreme Court justices are trying to determine how well or at least whether or not a given factual situation is consistent with generally agreed-upon legal principles and methods of analysis. Therefore agreement rather than disagreement should be the norm and in fact it is.
 942,  2013, a, There are now more agents along the 1954 mile-long border than ever before… Border agents per sector. Staffing has more than doubled in most of the nine sectors along the border but the growth has not been uniform. Nearly 40 percent of the border staff in 2012 was in Tucson or El Paso two sectors covering about 500 miles of the border with declining shares of immigrant traffic. They were among the main locations of illegal border crossings during the Mexican migration wave that peaked around 2005.…and apprehensions along the border have dropped sharply … Apprehensions per sector. Overall apprehensions have fallen as the number of people caught trying to cross the border illegally has declined sharply in recent years largely because there were fewer people trying to cross the border in the first place. The recession was a factor. But criminal control on the Mexican side of the border and increased border patrol staffing increased the risks and cost of the trip making it harder to cross successfully in recent years.
 929,  2013, a, NEW ORLEANS — N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell suggested Friday that the league could use suspensions more often to enforce its crackdown on hits to the head. During the season the league suspended Ravens safety Ed Reed for his third violation of rules prohibiting helmet-to-helmet hits on defenseless players. The suspension was overturned on appeal by Ted Cottrell an N.F.L. hearing officer.“I think we’re going to have to continue to see discipline escalate particularly on repeat offenders” Goodell said. “It’s not just the player the defenseless player that’s being protected; it’s the person doing the striking. We see in the injury rates that the defenseless player and the defensive back are having a higher injury rate.”When players keep violating the rule they’re going to be taken off the field he said adding“Suspension gets through to them.”Goodell made the remarks during his annual state-of-the-league news conference which was heavy with questions about player safety. It came one day after players union leaders at a Thursday news conference challenged the league on several player safety issues.Union leaders said that they wanted a neutral chief safety officer to be appointed to hear appeals about acceptable levels of care and that an internal survey of players showed that most did not trust their team’s medical staff. The union offered no numbers from the survey.Goodell sounded irritated by the union’s announcements noting two times that the league and union met for four hours last week — with players and owners in attendance — and the survey had not been raised by the union an indication of the fractured relationship between the league and the players.Among the other topics Goodell touched on:He thinks the N.F.L. will have testing for human growth hormone for the 2013 season. The league and union agreed to start testing when the collective bargaining agreement was completed 18 months ago but since then they have sparred over the details and Congress has begun to apply pressure to get the agreement finished.He said the league would look to set standards for the quality of playing fields probably a reaction to the sloppy turf at FedEx Field.He said his only regret from the Saints’ bounty scandal was his inability to get everyone — he singled out the union — to realize that bounties must be eliminated from the game.GIANTS PUNTER’S DENIAL Mitch Ross who told Sports Illustrated that he had given Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis a spray form of deer antler extract containing a substance banned by the N.F.L. told reporters that he had also supplied other N.F.L. players with the spray including Giants punter Steve Weatherford.Weatherford denied the allegation in a message on Twitter writing: “I have never used anything illegal in my life. Being a role model is too important to me. These claims are a marketing ploy.” Weatherford has consulted with a lawyer Peter Siachos about Ross’s statements.Lewis has also denied having used the substance.— SAM BORDEN
 130,  2019, a, Getting a lot of vitamin A in your diet is tied to a lower risk for squamous cell carcinoma a common form of skin cancer a review of studies has found.Squamous cell carcinoma a slow-growing cancer usually found on sun-exposed areas is easy to treat if found early although in rare cases it can spread to other tissues.The researchers writing in JAMA Dermatology used detailed health and diet data from 123570 men and women participating in two long-term studies. They found 3978 cases of squamous cell cancer over more than 26 years of follow-up.After controlling for various health factors including age other skin cancers and the number of lifetime blistering sunburns they found that compared with the one-fifth of people with the lowest intake of vitamin A those in the highest one-fifth had a 17 percent reduced risk for squamous cell cancer.
 3909,  1997, a, MR. CLINTON pledged that the United States would cut emissions to 1990 levels in the next 10 to 15 years. The turnabout in emissions will be encouraged at first with tax incentives and research subsidies for conservation and clean energy production.In later years a cap will be placed on greenhouse emissions coupled with a system to give credits for emissions reductions that companies can save and sell. It is a system in which the Government will set a mandatory goal but leave the mechanism to the market instead of turning to a Government fiat.If the Administration's approach delivers the promised reductions emissions between 2008 and 2012 will be about a third lower than current trends would predict.But nobody knows how much that will cost. ''There is no credible widely accepted economic analysis that currently exists in the United States or in most other countries that can answer very basic cost and benefit questions'' said Eileen B. Claussen a former senior aide to Mr. Wirth who had played an instrumental role in the talks but left the Administration a few months ago.It wasn't for lack of trying. The Administration struggled for two years to come up with a credible analysis of the economic effects of moving away from fossil fuels but the uncertainties -- over things like what the United States economy will look like a decade from now what technological advances in emissions controls will be made and how willing consumers and manufacturers will be to respond to economic incentives -- proved overwhelming. Ms. Yellen essentially declared the effort to come up with reliable numbers a failure last summer.That opened the door to something of a policy-making free-for-all that lasted well into the fall and has left many members of Congress wary Ms. Claussen said.There was never any serious debate inside the Administration about the science of the issue; the White House has decided that the climate problem is real and serious. After all the leading environmentalist of them all is Mr. Gore and he long ago won over President Clinton on the need to do something about the threat of climate change.

 3474,  1999, a, This finding was as perplexing as it was intriguing. The men all had jobs and equal access to health care under Britain's national health system. But mortality rates for men in the lowest civil service classification the researchers found were three times higher than those for men in the highest grade. And a 25-year follow-up of the Whitehall subjects some results of which were published in 1996 found the social class gradient persisted well past retirement even among men into their late 80's.Subsequent studies demonstrated a similar relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality in the United States and Canada.What could account for such startling findings? One plausible explanation was that lower-ranked men might engage in more risky behaviors like smoking. But the same health disparity from pay grade to pay grade that was evident in smokers held for nonsmokers too. And all coronary risk factors combined the researchers found accounted for only a third of the differences between grades.Stress or other aspects of psychological life that can have an impact on a person's vulnerability to disease the Whitehall group reasoned might also play a role in the results. Prolonged exposure to stress researchers have found can lead to abnormalities in immune function and glucose metabolism and destroy brain cells involved in memory. And studies show that the lower one's social status the more stressed people feel and the more stressful events they encounter in their lives.Dr. Sheldon Cohen professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh has demonstrated a link between social status and vulnerability to infectious disease in male macaque monkeys. In a study carried out in conjunction with primate researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine Dr. Cohen found that males at the lower end of the dominance hierarchy were more susceptible to a cold virus than dominant males.Dr. Cohen and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon then replicated those findings in humans. Subjects in the study were asked to rate their relative standing in their community on a social status ladder then were exposed to mild respiratory virus. People who ranked themselves low on the ladder were more likely to become infected with the virus than those who ranked themselves higher up on the ladder.In another study the researchers found that people who had been unemployed for one month or more under highly stressful conditions were 3.8 times more susceptible to a virus than people who were not experiencing a significant stressful situation.

 3288,  2000, a, Dr. William R. (Reyn) Archer III is the health commissioner for the state of Texas. He got into trouble a few weeks ago when in an interview with The Times he made some untoward remarks about Hispanics and teen pregnancy.The remarks proved embarrassing to Gov. George W. Bush who has been running from one photo-op to another posing relentlessly with black and brown children and teenagers trying to show that he and his party are not the mortal enemies of ethnic minorities.(The governor's task is not an easy one when you consider that Ronald Reagan chose to kick off his 1980 general election campaign in Philadelphia Miss. which is where the civil rights workers Andrew Goodman Michael Schwerner and James Chaney were murdered and that the governor's own father George Herbert Walker Bush pumped up his win over Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race with the loathsome Willie Horton ads.)So George W. does what he can to put a friendlier face on the G.O.P. and then he picks up The Times and sees that his man Reyn Archer is blaming the sky-high teen pregnancy rate in Texas on the fact that Hispanics lack the cultural belief ''that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''

 5010,  1990, a, Pat Dye the Auburn coach was fit to be tied again. In a home-stadium battle on Saturday night with Tennessee their foremost Southeastern Conference rival Dye's Tigers came from a 26-9 deficit to trail 26-25.Auburn had scored on a 13-yard fourth-down pass Stan White to Greg Taylor with 1 minute 56 seconds remaining. For the ensuing conversion play the choice was to try for 2 points and victory or place-kick for 1 and a deadlock.Dye chose the tie and got it as he had on the last play of the 1988 Sugar Bowl when Auburn tied Syracuse 16-16. After that fans of the Orangemen sent the coach dozens of neckties and derisive challenges to his courage.After this latest tie the Auburn coach predictably said that his team had played too hard to come away with a loss; that a defeat might have knocked the Tigers out of the run for the conference championship which Auburn has won or tied for the last three seasons and he did not want to take that chance away from his team.

 243,  2018, a, BEIJING — The billionaire founder of JD.com one of China’s largest and most successful online retailers was arrested Friday in Minnesota for alleged sexual misconduct before being released a day later police records show.In a statement posted Sunday afternoon on the Chinese social media platform Weibo JD.com said the executive Liu Qiangdong — who goes by Richard Liu in the English speaking world — had been falsely accused. “During a business trip to the United States Mr. Liu was questioned by police in Minnesota in relation to an unsubstantiated accusation” the company said. “The local police quickly determined there was no substance to the claim against Mr. Liu and he was subsequently able to resume his business activities as originally planned.”Police officials in Minneapolis said they were treating the case as an active investigation.The matter is another unwelcome bit of publicity for a company that symbolizes the business potential of China’s rising middle class. The accusation could also be a test of JD.com’s stability as well as the ability of a Chinese technology company to rebound from the problems of its leaders. China’s most powerful technology companies are still tightly controlled by their founders so the fortunes of businesses worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are closely intertwined with the fates of a small number of executives.JD.com whose shares trade in the United States has prospered by catering to the increasing sophistication of Chinese shoppers. Big global brands such as Nike Prada and Levi’s use JD.com’s sales platform to reach the country’s burgeoning middle class and the company is closely watched as an indicator of consumer confidence.

 5712,  1985, a, ''ANCIENT LIVES'' a four- part series examines ancient Egypt a land where the living shared territorial rights with the dead. Apparently this worked to everyone's advantage. A sense of community led to great art and interesting artifacts. The series begins on Channel 13 at 8 tonight.The opening program ''A Village of Craftsmen'' looks at a settlement in the hills of Thebes. (This is not to be confused with the Thebes in Greece; for one thing the Thebes in Egypt was older.) John Romer the host of the series says we know more about the people who lived in the settlement 3000 years ago than we do ''about most people in the last century.'' The ancient Egyptians were inveterate scribblers recording their lives on stone.Thus Mr. Romer an Egyptologist takes us on a tour of the village: Here lived a little old lady who adored a pet monkey; there lived a scribe who wrote love poetry. Mr. Romer scambles up hillsides and over fallen statuary. Sometimes he grows breathless and sometimes his British accent gets in the way. On the whole however he is not a bad guide.Nonetheless the great appeal here is not the lesson in Egyptology but the lesson in design. Have the graphic arts improved all that much in 3000 years? ''Ancient Lives'' indicates they have not. The people in the settlement decorated their own modest tombs with striking pictures carefully rendered. Even everyday artifacts were made with care. Form function and esthetic appeal seem to have been given equal weight.
 1455,  2010, a, Tom Brookshier a star defensive back who helped lead the Philadelphia Eagles to the 1960 National Football League championship and later teamed with Pat Summerall as CBS’s No. 1 pro football broadcasting duo died Friday at a hospital in the Philadelphia suburb of Wynnewood Pa. Brookshier who lived in West Conshohocken Pa. was 78.The cause was cancer said his wife Barbara.When Brookshier a native of Roswell N.M. joined the Eagles in 1953 out of the University of Colorado he was a 10th-round draft pick. Figuring he was likely to be cut he decided to make an immediate impression on the Eagles’ coach Jim Trimble at training camp in Hershey Pa.As he once related it on the Eagles’ Web site: “Our No. 1 draft choice came downfield on a pass pattern and I knocked him out. Our coach jumped and yelled and I thought ‘Oh my God I’m going to get cut!’ But he ran out and said ‘I like that!’ ”Brookshier intercepted eight passes that season and went on to become a key figure in the Eagles’ defense.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyHis former teammate Chuck Bednarik a Hall of Fame linebacker said the 6-foot 196-pound Brookshier “might have been the toughest defensive back of our era; he was a hitter.”
 2663,  2004, a, At the Calvary Chapel in Fort Lauderdale an evangelical church with a racially diverse congregation a guest speaker Rick Green a former Texas lawmaker who often talks to conservative groups told 3500 worshipers to "vote for righteousness." He directed people to "voter guides" in the hallway. One published by the Christian Coalition claimed that Mr. Kerry supported abortion and gay marriage. (Mr. Kerry has said he opposes same-sex marriage.) Books including "America's Godly Heritage" and "Is America One Nation Under God?" were on sale. On her way out Maureen Crocco 58 said of Mr. Bush "This is a man who lives out his faith and I don't see anything wrong with that."At the First Assembly of God Church an evangelical congregation in Des Moines the Rev. John M. Palmer told 800 worshipers: "I pray that God gives wisdom to every voter making choices and that they will support individuals who uphold the sanctity of life. To choose individuals who are committed to biblical ways and who will lead this nation with a biblical perspective."A brochure in the program asked "Why Must Christians Vote?" and quoted Scripture in answer: "When the godly are in authority the people rejoice. But when the wicked are in power they groan."Kelli Russell 17 said she was for Mr. Bush. "He believes what I believe and I support what he has done in office" she said.In Denver it was the Day of the Dead at the Cameron Church a United Methodist congregation that honors loved ones and ancestors on the last Sunday of October on or close to Halloween. The altar was crowded with mementos and music to "wake the spirits" was played. Most of the worshipers though not all were Kerry supporters and some wore buttons proclaiming their allegiance.But the senior pastor the Rev. Bill Kirton was nonpartisan in his sermon focusing on a scriptural beast in the Book of Daniel. "If you are a liberal you are a beast and if you are a conservative you are a beast to somebody" he said. He advised looking past the election to what he called things that matter.In Cleveland the Rev. C. Jay Matthews pastor of the Mount Sinai Baptist Church a black congregation recalled a personal political journey that had taken him from Mr. Bush to Mr. Kerry. "I have supported this president and I've been a leader in promoting his faith-based initiatives" Mr. Matthews said. He even met with the Republican national chairman Ed Gillespie on how to raise black votes. But his congregation did not go along and he had second thoughts as the campaign in Ohio became bitter with negative attacks.
