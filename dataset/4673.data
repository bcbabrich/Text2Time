CONSUMERS may have less money to spend, but dining out is decidedly not out.

According to the National Restaurant Association, the average family spends 43 cents of every food dollar at restaurants. That number, which includes everything from takeout pizza to meals on airliners, has never been higher. This year, the group estimates that food service sales will reach $262 billion, up 5.6 percent from the $248 billion spent in 1991.

Such statistics have helped the stocks of most publicly traded restaurant companies hold their own fairly well this year, after a banner performance in 1991. For the year through last Friday, the 23 restaurant stocks tracked on a daily basis by Montgomery Securities have declined by 6 percent, compared with a 1 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 400 average.

In some respects, the drop should have been expected, because prices of those same stocks rose a hefty 59 percent in 1991, compared with a 27 percent increase in the S.& P. 400 average.

That the drop this year was only 6 percent is surprising, given that the industry has seen no growth in spending on an inflation-adjusted basis in nearly three years and is raising prices at the slowest pace in close to three decades.
