Urging that the United States ''move beyond the pain of a war which cost more than one million lives,'' about 150 prominent American religious and political leaders, academicians and former antiwar activists have called on President Reagan to pursue normal diplomatic relations with Vietnam.

The letter was presented to the White House before Mr. Reagan's meeting in Bali with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Signers included Julian Bond, State Senator from Georgia; Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa; George McGovern, the former Senator; Dr. Benjamin Spock, the antiwar activist; the Rev. Jesse Jackson, chairman of the National Rainbow Coalition, and the actors Edward Asner and Mike Farrell.
