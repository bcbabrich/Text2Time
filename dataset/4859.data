The UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, yesterday reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings and Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., parent of Continental Airlines, reported that third-quarter losses had narrowed substantially.

Both airline companies are struggling to recover from the severe downturn in passenger traffic that began in January with the Persian Gulf war, which also doubled fuel prices.

While traffic has recovered somewhat, the increase has been anemic. Traffic in September, for example, was up only five-tenths of 1 percent over that of September 1990.

Following are details of the companies' results: United Airlines

UAL had earnings of $25 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with profits of $106.1 million, or $4.87 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue totaled $3.23 billion, up from $2.97 billion in the 1990 quarter.
