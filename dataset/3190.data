FROM Route 9H, you can just glimpse Talavera, a yellow, Greek revival mansion with white trim and fluted columns. The house, serenely overlooking the Catskills and the Berkshires, seems deliberately hidden as you wind your way up a long driveway. Only as you reach the foot of the spacious lawn does Talavera reveal itself in all its faded elegance, subject to the inroads of time but occupied in unbroken succession by the Van Ness and Philip families for nearly 200 years.

Every fall, some 2,000 city dwellers and suburbanites make their way to the orchards around back, where descendants of the original owners are making ends meet by running a pick-your-own-apple business. Apples cost $14 to $16 a bushel, depending on the variety, which includes McIntoshes, Northern Spy, Mutsu and Jonagolds. The family also sells heritage tomatoes and pears -- among them Anjou, rare on the East Coast, and Harrow Sweet.

''My great-great-aunts would have died to see me in pants and down there taking money,'' said Leila Philip, 40, an English professor at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. ''But it's an important job that needs to be done. I enjoy the people, and I feel it connects me to a long history.''

The Philip family's once extensive land holdings in Columbia County -- 294 acres in 1732 -- have diminished to 125 acres. In 1992, when Ms. Philip's father, John Van Ness Philip Jr., died, it looked as though the family might lose the place forever. The cost of labor, machinery and materials had risen drastically in recent years, and apples could be raised more cheaply outside the United States.
