In fact, levels of growth hormone in the fish are so low, Mr. Matheson said, that the Food and Drug Administration will not require one particular set of tests -- feeding the salmon to rodents -- that are typical for new drugs for animals.

''You can't choke rats with enough salmon to cause an effect other than choking,'' he said. Some scientists not involved with the company also pointed out that fish growth hormone was unlikely to have an effect on humans.

The salmon do not even grow to be unusually large, Dr. Fletcher said, as even 7-year-old salmon at AquAdvantage have never weighed more than 17 pounds, large but far from record-breaking for the species.

Mr. Entis also said that the new fish taste just like other salmon grown on farms.

Some scientists not involved with the company also played down food safety concerns but said it would be important to know, for example, if the foreign growth hormone triggered increased production of other compounds, like insulinlike growth factors. Mr. Entis of A/F Protein said the company had been asked to look into that question and others as part of the continuing Food and Drug Administration review.

'What If' Situations Are Studied

Salmon are typically grown in enclosures in the sea, known as net pens, renowned for being torn by waves or hungry wild animals. Fish routinely escape, sometimes by the tens of thousands. If the genetically engineered, or transgenic fish, are grown in such pens, some will eventually slip out into the wild, some researchers say.

If they do, wild fish could be potentially devastated, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in November by Dr. William Muir, a population geneticist, and Dr. Richard Howard, an aquatic ecologist, both at Purdue University.

The two researchers studied mating and survivorship in normal and genetically engineered versions of a fish known as a medaka. Using this information, researchers developed a computer model simulating the escape of a genetically modified fish into the wild. The study showed that if wild females preferred to mate with genetically engineered males and if those matings produced offspring that did not survive well, wild populations could be wiped out, a result they called the Trojan gene effect.
