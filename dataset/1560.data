With publishers looking for ways to capitalize on e-books, starting an independent publishing house may be as foolhardy as investing in Betamax. But that’s not stopping Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. He and the editor/publisher Eva Prinz founded Ecstatic Peace Library (ecstaticpeacelibrary.com, or facebook.com/pages/Ecstatic-Peace-Library/346362294368), which features art, design, photography and poetry books, including “Fly Me” by Yoko Ono, a limited-edition book and box of kites, each with a kite frame, strings, instructions on flying and a message from Ono.

Moore hatched the Ecstatic Peace franchise a decade ago. In 2001 he started the Ecstatic Peace Poetry Journal and has published it every year since. He and Andrew Kesin run a record label called Ecstatic Peace Records and Tapes, which releases music by their favorite indie musicians, like Hush Arbors, Luke Roberts and Tall Firs. “Thurston is building an underground consortium quietly taking over the world,” Prinz joked.

Journals and record labels are one thing, but why, when the future of the book is in question, would anyone start a traditional publishing imprint? “Small-press publishing is a tradition that at times can be pleasurable for us and other times spiritual,” Moore said. Indeed, the more solid the niche, the greater the potential for success. So far, Ecstatic Peace Library has produced handmade limited-edition art catalogs and modest editions of poetry chapbooks. But its first catalog of widely distributed art books (through DAP) this fall will logically be focused on music. “One could say that music is our niche, and three out of seven of the titles are packaged with vinyl records,” Moore explained.

Ecstatic Peace Library has a decidedly eclectic point of view. Last year it released 500 signed/numbered catalogs of the photographer Justine Kurland’s recent train-hopping landscapes and portraits. It was followed by 100 handmade copies of “Go Vegan!” by the artist Jonathan Horowitz. Back in the music niche, there is “The Noise Paintings,” by Thurston’s wife and bandmate, Kim Gordon, which comes with a cassette. There are poetry chapbooks, as well as the Yoko Ono book, about which Moore added: “We are hoping to fly these on Labor Day weekend in Strawberry Fields.”

Moore and Prinz believe that the analog and digital are more distinct in books than in other media. “To say that an art book can be an e-book is ignorant of the tradition and art of color separations, printing and binding,” Prinz said. “Likewise, to suspect that a digital storytelling experience is simply a pdf downloaded on your iPad or Kindle platform is disrespectful to the interactive arts and artists.” She has been experimenting with video game technology to create their first e-book. “In similar processes to those employed by the 1960s experimental subcommittee of the College de Pataphysique, a group of French writers and poets who called themselves OuLiPo (Ouvroir de litterature potentielle),” Prinz continued, “Ecstatic Peace Library is creating new ways to ‘escape’ into literature and art.” Next year, they are hoping to introduce a few of those productions, as well as a Web-exclusive “Abbie Hoffman-inspired Free Store, to release books, poetry and art for free.”

These days more books are being made as “objects” and “experiences,” so Moore and Prinz have been perfecting the format for a so-called record/book. “After 25 maquettes, we finally nailed the industrial design,” Moore explained. “The record is affixed to the cover of the book so that the label on the record itself is the cover image and can change depending on whether side A or B is up.”

Ecstatic Peace Library books are, however, just a slice of the operation. There are also readings and exhibitions (at places like White Columns and Tate Modern) and performances (Cosmic Newsstand and “A Dissertation on White Noise” benefit for “Avant-Garde Preschool” P.S. 126 at Partners & Spade).

But the duo is most excited by the book “James Hamilton: You Should Have Heard Just What I Seen,” which will be released in November. Hamilton, a photographer for The Village Voice, had an archive that had never been cracked open, “so it had to be published,” Prinz said. “Thurston looked through every week of Hamilton’s interesting life, every protest, riot, concert, personal appearance, signing, in-store, after-party, press conference, studio rehearsal, sound check. I recall asking him with indignation whether he was really that into Rod Stewart when I found him hunched over with his loupe one afternoon, looking through Rod Stewart’s contact sheets. He pointed out Patti Smith in the pictures, and told me that Patti was interviewing Rod for Crawdaddy! magazine. It was so random, but so cool — Rod and Patti had the exact same haircut.” Other titles they had to publish are those that, according to Prinz, “we’ve pitched to publishers for years but were too obscure for anybody.” She cited a November release, “Party With Me Punker” by Jordan Schwartz and Dave Markey, as one that “nobody ‘got’ when I brought it into editorial meetings at Rizzoli and Abrams,” she recalled. “Thurston and I do not really feel it’s necessary to make something that we know someone else would publish.”

Correction:

An earlier version of this post misstated the name of the book by the artist Jonathan Horowitz. It is “Go Vegan!,” not Vegan Zine.
