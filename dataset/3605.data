To the Editor:

It's depressing to learn that young editors at our top publishers are thinking like the trash tabloids (Buzz: ''Fantasies of Monica Lewinsky: The Book,'' Feb. 8). These people will soon be deciding which books get published and which will not make it. On what grounds?

Not long ago, book publishing attracted graduates who were educated enough to find and promote fine authors and exciting ideas. They were willing to work for less than they could make elsewhere because they had a vision of publishing's importance to society.

The Radcliffe Publishing Course graduates would surely smile at such notions as dinosaur behavior that vanished along with standards of quality and integrity. Today, as one said: ''There has to be dirt, or forget it. No dirt, no cash.''
