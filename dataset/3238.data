Hillary Rodham Clinton has hired the Manhattan advertising firm whose ads for New York magazine in 1997 enraged Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to produce the media campaign in her bid for the United States Senate, officials said yesterday.

The firm, DeVito/Verdi, has a reputation for edgy, streetwise advertising but has no previous experience working for political candidates. The firm will work with two veteran Democratic operatives: Mandy Grunwald, a media consultant, and Mark Penn, a pollster.

DeVito/Verdi, based in SoHo, developed an ad campaign that ran on the sides of public buses featuring pictures of Mr. Giuliani and proclaiming New York magazine as ''possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit for.''

The ads appeared in November 1997, shortly after Mr. Giuliani was overwhelmingly re-elected for a second term. But the mayor, infuriated at being portrayed as self-aggrandizing, complained to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which removed the ads until a federal appeals court ordered them restored.
