THE passing of the Bush Administration and the likely demise of its regulation-diluting Council on Competitiveness are generally considered good news for companies in the environmental business, analysts say. Although they caution that the coming Clinton Administration is not likely to fulfill all of the promises made on the campaign trail, mainly because of economic constraints, analysts say the Government's tone will shift in favor of environmental projects.

"We are clearly going to see more enforcement of regulations in the new Administration, more hazardous waste cleanup and maybe more funding for waste water plants," said Vishnu Swarup, an analyst at Prudential Securities Research. The industry has been weak for the last two years as a result of the economic recession and lax regulation, he said.

Grant Ferrier, editor of the newsletter Environmental Business Journal, said growth in the environmental industry slowed sharply in the 1990's after gaining at a 20 percent annual rate for most of the 1980's. Growth slowed to 10 percent in 1990 and 2 percent last year, he said.

Now the San Diego-based publication is projecting a return to higher growth in an industry that ranges from garbage collectors to high-tech engineering and consulting firms. Total revenues in the industry are expected to grow to $174 billion by 1996, from about $120 billion currently. That is $28 billion more than the Environment Business Journal estimates the industry would have generated in revenue if the Bush Administration's policies had continued for four more years.
