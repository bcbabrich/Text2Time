Last week, we found ourselves marveling at the work of Sterling Beaumon, the 13-year-old actor on “Lost” who plays the junior version of Benjamin Linus, the show’s resident genius of ambiguous morality (whose grown-up incarnation is played by Michael Emerson). A few days later, in a crazy twist of fate involving time travel, smoke monsters and a helpful publicist, we found ourselves on the phone with the young actor. In this conversation with Sterling (which may contain spoilers for the uninitiated), he spoke with us about the polarizing “Lost” cliffhanger he was involved in last week, and ended up quizzing us about what we think is taking place on the show.

How were you cast to play Young Ben on “Lost”?

I went through like three auditions, and the first one was with the casting director, April Webster. And I guess I did really good, because she said right in the room, “Oh, I’m going to want to bring you back to the producers and writers.” They took a week or so, and then they decided, yeah, we want you as this character, Young Ben. But this is way back in season 3. So then it evolved from season 3 to season 5.

Were you a fan of “Lost” at the time?

No, I actually wasn’t watching the show. I actually hated the show before I was on it. [laughs] Because I was on another show on ABC, called “In Case of Emergency,” and my episode that I guest-starred on kept on getting pre-empted, because of “Lost.”

What did you think about the grown-up version of Ben?

The only episode I had watched in season 3 was my episode, when it aired. So we waited on season 3 to come out on DVD before watched the rest. Then I thought he was a total jerk. But now, after season 4, I think he has a method to his madness.

Which is…?

I have no idea, but I think he’s a good guy in the end. He always has a plan, and it hasn’t turned out that badly, lately. And of course now that we know that the people on the freighter were not exactly the greatest people in the world, it just seems like maybe he really did save them.

Are you asked to base your performance on Michael Emerson?

My first episode of season 5, Jack Bender [a “Lost” director and executive producer] told me, “Don’t act like Ben. It will ruin what’s to come.” You have to have a little bit of him in there, because that’s totally impractical for him to change 150 percent. So I have a little bit of him in there, but he’s a nice, sweet, innocent kid. But he’s a very devious kid.

How is he devious?

Uh, he blew up a house.

Good point. Was it at all difficult for you to film the very brutal cliffhanger that concluded last week’s episode?

Oh, it was so much fun. I was so excited.

Really?

Yes. In fact, everybody had a controversy with a kid getting shot on TV. But I didn’t care, and neither did my mom. I found it funny.

It was controversial on the set?

No, they had to do it in the script. But everybody now, after the episode was aired, everybody online or everybody that I talk to is freaking out. They said, They can’t shoot a kid!

But you were comfortable doing it?

I’m fine with it. As long as it makes the show have better ratings, I’m cool.

Was it hard for you to watch it later?

Oh, I love watching that scene. It’s so much fun. Somebody has it up on YouTube, and I copied in and put it on my MySpace page.

Are you at all like Ben in real life?

Not too much. I mean, I have my secrets. [laughs]

I suppose it would be silly to ask what those secrets are.

Yeah. And most of them are about the show. I’m curious — do you think Ben is alive?

Well, he grows up to become an adult, so he must be — right?

Ah. You think he becomes an adult. Now, this is just from watching, if you listen back to when the Losties first meet up with the Dharma people, when Miles asked Daniel Faraday, “Hey, we don’t get involved, right?” And Daniel Faraday says, “It doesn’t matter now, we’re stuck in this time, we’re going to change something.” So they’re changing time. Don’t forget, way back in season 2, we saw Ben without his shirt on, and there was no scar.

Are you becoming more recognizable at school for your television work?

Not any more, because I don’t go to regular school any more. Because “Lost” was going to take up so much time, my school said you can’t miss that much, you’re going to have to go to a home-school program.

Do you like that as much as going to a regular school?

I’m liking it. It’s a lot harder, because you’re basically teaching yourself. That part’s hard about it.

Is that how evil geniuses are created?

I think it would be a good way.
