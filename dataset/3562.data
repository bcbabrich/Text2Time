Federal authorities arrested a former Bank of New York employee yesterday on charges of making false statements to investigators in a money laundering inquiry involving the bank and its clients in Russia. She entered a plea of not guilty.

According to a criminal complaint filed Monday and unsealed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan, the former employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, of Brooklyn, lied about dealings with Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin, a married couple at the center of the investigation.

Ms. Edwards formerly worked as a vice president in the Bank of New York's Eastern European division, while Mr. Berlin ran two money transfer businesses known as the Benex International Company and Becs International. More than $7 billion flowed from Russia through accounts held by those companies at the Bank of New York. An undetermined portion of the money may have come from criminal activities, investigators say.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York have been examining that movement of funds since September 1998, but no money laundering charges have been filed. Ms. Edwards, Mr. Berlin and a business associate, Aleksey Volkov, were indicted by a federal grand jury in September on criminal charges of illegally running a money transfer business. The Bank of New York has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
