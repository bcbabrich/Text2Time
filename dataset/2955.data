In a move that CNN said was unrelated to the controversy, it also began a five-part series on the victims of suicide bombers on the CNN service shown on Israel and around the world, CNN International, with Wolf Blitzer as its host.

Taken together, the moves were interpreted by Israeli and Palestinian officials, media critics and reporters covering the conflict as an appeasement of CNN's critics in Israel and the United States.

And they have led to bad feelings among some inside CNN. ''It appears as if we're in an unseemly rush to try to fix things, and I think we're going to dig ourselves into a deeper hole if we continue this course,'' said one CNN staff member in Jerusalem, who said complaints from Israelis to the office there were coming through loudest and with the most ferocity.

CNN executives said they were not appeasing critics, but, rather, setting the record straight on Mr. Turner and emphasizing that CNN's coverage was fair. They said two suicide bombings on two consecutive days last month that killed 26 in Jerusalem -- the same week Mr. Turner's comments were published -- persuaded them to put together the series on Israeli terrorism victims.

''People who are really examining the issues closely would see CNN is doing first-rate journalistic work,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''And we are not going to kowtow to one side or the other.''

Still, the series drew complaints from Palestinians. ''Do we have to pay for the statements of Ted Turner?'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator. ''I can't believe that CNN is giving five segments a half-hour each to the Israelis without the courtesy of showing one segment on the Palestinian victims. I hate to see that the pressure on CNN has affected their objectivity, as reflected in the Blitzer report.'' He said CNN should do a similar series on civilian Palestinian victims of Israeli military operations. CNN said it regularly covered the plights of Palestinian victims.

For CNN's many critics in Israel, however, the series was a long time coming. ''What's happened here in the past two years -- the coverage was not according to journalistic standards,'' a government official said, adding that during Israel's recent military campaign to root terrorists out of Palestinian neighborhoods, ''CNN took almost totally the Palestinian line.''
