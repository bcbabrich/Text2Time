On our way to a screening of "Shark Tale," my daughter and I fell into a discussion of "Finding Nemo," a movie she has seen several dozen times. The subject came up naturally enough, since the movie we were about to see, which opens nationwide today, is DreamWorks's attempt to follow Disney and Pixar into the lucrative and technologically demanding world of underwater computer-generated 3-D animation. In anticipation of the novel delights of "Shark Tale," my daughter was happy to revise her earlier high opinion of "Nemo." "It's about a fish who gets lost," she said with a shrug. "That's not really very interesting."

As if on guard against such jadedness, the makers of "Shark Tale" have ensured that their movie is about as many things as possible, including a fish who gets lost, though not quite in the way that Nemo did. The busy story, in any case, with its predictable messages -- Be who you are! Don't forget where you came from! Fish are friends, not food! -- is secondary to the packaging, a bright, hectic swirl of easy jokes and accessible pop-culture allusions.

There are cheerful quasi-ethnic stereotypes -- jellyfish Rastafarians, shark Mafiosi, aquatic ghetto kids with cans of spray paint -- that are technically insulated against offensiveness because, well, they're all fish. There are movie-star voices galore -- Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Ren√©e Zellweger, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie -- and even, more unusually, a recognizable movie-director voice and caricature. I'm relieved (and maybe just a tiny bit disappointed) to report that when Sykes, a fast-talking blowfish with bushy eyebrows, appeared on screen, my daughter, who is 5, did not lean over and whisper, "Hey, isn't that Martin Scorsese?"

But of course Mr. Scorsese was not there for her benefit. Like the "Shrek" pictures, also from DreamWorks, "Shark Tale" lobs a barrage of movie and television references over the heads of the children in the audience and into the faces of their parents. Some of these are visual, like Sykes's resemblance to the auteur reading his lines, while others pop up on the soundtrack, which quotes the scores from "The Godfather," "Car Wash" and, of course, "Jaws." For the finale, fishy likenesses of Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott strut and prance while the real-life divas sing us through the closing credits.
