William K. Reilly, President Bush's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, signaled a sharp break with Reagan Administration policies today by saying he would propose legislation to reduce acid rain.

Answering questions at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on his nomination, Mr. Reilly said the first item on his agenda was legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act. He said a major component of that legislation would be a program for reducing acid precipitation caused by pollution from coal-burning power plants and other sources.

Mr. Reilly said that members of the Bush transition staff and the agency's staff had been working out details of the legislation and that the bill would be ready to go to Congress within a few weeks. He said the bill would contain a specific goal for reducing the pollution caused by acid rain, a goal that he could not pinpoint because it was still being worked out by the staff. Cost of Plan Put at Billions

Mr. Reilly was not asked at the hearing how much such a program would cost, and he has declined to be interviewed on any subject until he is confirmed. Others have estimated, however, that many billions of dollars would have to be spent to achieve any significant reductions in the pollution responsible for acid rain.
