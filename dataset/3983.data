The evening's hottest attraction was van Gogh's "Interior of a Restaurant" (1887-88), a rare subject for an artist best known for outdoor scenes. It was sold last night to James Roundell, who headed the departm'nt of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's in London until he went into business for himself last year. Christie's had expected the painting to fetch about $10 million, which is exactly what it did. Three bidders slugged it out until Mr. Roundell finally won at $10.3 million. The Danforth family of Rhode Island was the seller.

Most of the best property last night came from estates, and Christie's got the best of them this season. A prime example is works that once belonged to Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer and film producer who died two years ago. Sotheby's sold some of Mr. Hazen's property last fall; Christie's got the rest.

Degas's pastel "Woman in a Tub" (1884), estimated at $6 million to $8 million, elicited a painfully slow battle between two anonymous telephone bidders. It finally sold to one of them for $5.4 million.

Picassos did well last season, but there were fewer last night and the best performed badly despite the "Picasso and Portraiture" show that just opened at the Museum of Modern Art. "The Reader," a 1932 portrait of the artist's mistress Marie-Therese Walter, failed to sell. Bidding never went above $4.8 million. Christie's had estimated it would bring $6 million to $8 million. "We were within a whisper of selling it," Mr. Findlay said.

William Rubin, longtime head of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, who organized the Modern's Picasso show, was at Christie's last night and seemed unfazed by the painting's failure to sell. "The Picasso had been on the market too recently," he said. "But all in all it was a healthy sale. The market is definitely firmer."

The sale total was helped in large part by several hefty prices paid for pretty Impressionist paintings. Monet's "Contarini Palace" (1908), a view of the Venetian palace with its reflection in the Grand Canal, was estimated at $4 million to $6 million. It sold to the dealer David Nahmed for $4.2 million.
