The Associated Press Managing Editors Association adopted a resolution today calling on the Government of India to ''cease all proceedings, under way and contemplated'' against an Associated Press correspondent.

The reporter, Brahma Chellaney, a 27-year-old Indian citizen, has been charged with sedition and maliciously inciting sectarian discord through a dispatch he wrote in June.

The dispatch, which followed an assault by the Indian Army on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, quoted sources as saying some Sikhs had been killed in the temple raid with their hands tied behind their backs. The editors said that ''responsible Indian officials have corroborated Mr. Chellaney's news dispatches from Amritsar.''
