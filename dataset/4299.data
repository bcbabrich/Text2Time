Q: What's different about Open Vision?

A: Open Vision is the first company to start by launching a major acquisition campaign to bring technologies and people together, not based on market share, but on how "integratable" they are. We walked away from a lot of companies with large market share but whose products did not meet our standards of integration. Buyers are looking for a suite of technologies that work together. The second criterion was that the engineers who built the products had to come along. If they didn't feel comfortable joining Open Vision it wouldn't matter if the owners gave the company to us.

Q: You were at Oracle for its dramatic rise, its fall in 1990, when it had to restate its earnings, and its rise again. What lessons did you learn from that experience?

A: I was appointed president of Oracle U.S.A. about one week after the debacle in 1990, and I had to face the investment community when they heard what had happened. The stock went from $18 to $4.50 in a week. I learned you have to manage your business not based on what you would like to do but on what you know you can do. You can't let growth get too far ahead of your ability to support it.

Q: You are active in Black Executives in Software Technology. What do you think can be done about the relative absence of African Americans in this industry?

A: In educational centers, they tend to teach the science of developing computer systems, which is for people who want to go on to develop hardware. That path scares away a lot of blacks and a lot of women. But the real opportunities are in application development, which is built much more on logic than on physics. I tell students to see the software industry as a major opportunity. Although there is no industry I consider color- or gender-blind, this is one where your abilities carry much more weight than your gender or color. Michael S.
