The suspension is the most forceful action by Mr. Cortines, the head of a decentralized system of 32 districts, to confront what he has called failed leadership at many schools.

His predecessor, Joseph A. Fernandez, stepped in several times to take over some responsibilities of some boards in response to allegations of mismanagement or corruption, as did several of his predecessors, but the districts usually challenged this intervention and sometimes successfully blocked it.

Mitchell Moss, director of the urban research center at New York University, said the District 17 takeover points to the contrasts in the styles between the more confrontational Mr. Fernandez and Mr. Cortines, who is known for his conciliatory manner.

"What's interesting is that this happened in a nonhostile way, and the Chancellor is really being seen as the savior in a situation where there has been a local political collapse," Mr. Moss said.

The new trustees will conduct the two regular board meetings every month, Mr. Cortines said. He has also asked the new trustees to hold a public meeting each month with the suspended board to keep members abreast of issues at the district.

Mr. Cortines said that at the end of the school year his office would make a decision about whether to return control to local officials.

Mr. Cortines had become aware of the district's problems months ago when parents, principals and even the superintendent and individual board members began coming to him about such problems as missing equipment and books at one school that were presumably sold to a private school; budgets that were not passed in a timely fashion; allegations that two principals had been involved in a fistfight over their confidence in the superintendent, and the release of confidential information, including a student's name and phone number, by Mr. Leaks.
