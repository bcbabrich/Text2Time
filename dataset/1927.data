While G.O.P. veep choice Sarah Palin is likely most concerned with her daughter’s present condition, Jake Tapper at Political Punch has a blast from her past:

Officials of the Alaskan Independence Party say that Palin was once so independent, she was once a member of their party, which, since the 1970s, has been pushing for a legal vote for Alaskans to decide whether or not residents of the 49th state can secede from the United States. And while McCain’s motto — as seen in a new TV ad — is “Country First,” the AIP’s motto is the exact opposite — “Alaska First — Alaska Always.”

“Individually, you can come to your own judgment about how consequential these stories are,” writes Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo. “What they show pretty clearly now — in addition to the news that the McCain campaign is only now sending in a vetting team — is that John McCain didn’t do any serious vetting of Palin before he invited her to join his ticket and, he hopes, become Vice President of the United States. Fundamentally, of course, this is about John McCain. And the real issue here is what this slapdash decision says about his judgment.”

(Update: Tapper has a new post that indicates there’s no paper trail to prove Palin was involved with the separatist party.)
