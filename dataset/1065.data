YANCEY--Mary Anne,81, of Brooklyn Heights, NY, passed away unexpectedly October 25, 2013. Born in Walla Walla, Washington to a ranching family, she moved to NYC in 1954 after graduating from Whitman College. She married in 1956, raised her family in Brooklyn Heights, and earned three Masters degrees from Columbia University.

Previously, Mary Anne was the first woman Chair of the NYC Hospital Visiting Committee for the United Hospital Fund of NY, and the first woman President of the Plymouth Church Council. In the 1980's, she served as Director of Marketing for the City's largest home ownership program, at the Partnership for New York City. She is survived by her loving husband of 57 years, Richard, a former Managing Director of the investment banking firm Dillon, Read & Co. Inc., her brother Monte G. Shaffer, of Prosser, WA, her three children, Leslie of Whitefish, MT, Jennifer Young (Brian) of Taos, NM, and Richard Jr. (Inger) of Brooklyn, NY, as well as her five beloved grandsons, Gavin, Connor, Oliver, Felix and Neal.
