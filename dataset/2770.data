There are occasional romantic interludes, but the heart of the book involves Johannes Schöffmann, an Austrian baker whose passion for obscure varieties of trout exceeds even Prosek's, and who leads him through Europe and Central Asia, going so far as Mongolia in pursuit of grayling (a cousin of trout). Schöffmann's method, swimming underwater in a wet suit equipped with a small net, certainly facilitated catch-and-release fishing. Moreover, as he explains, ''Diving is the only safe way to fish if a warden is around.''

Still, the prose disappoints in several ways. For one thing, the color of trout, so handsomely presented in the plates of Prosek's earlier ''Trout: An Illustrated History,'' is hardly the stuff of words. Here, the few watercolors chiefly show scenery and people and we get, for the fish, language like this, about one caught in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan: ''I marveled at its sparse vermilion and black spots and the gentle daffodil yellow sides.''

And while one may welcome the fact that the book is not just a series of highly detailed descriptions of the stealth and wisdom required to bring one courageous trout to the net after another, using 6x leaders and size 22 elk-hair caddis flies, the accounts of catching fish are almost as lifeless as his scenic descriptions are vivid. Oddly, he almost never gives the color of the fly he uses, as here, in Spain: ''I rigged up my fly rod, tying a small dry fly to the line. Then, taking care not to hook the branch of one of the scrubby oaks, I cast my fly into the pool. It landed softly and floated over where the trout were feeding. One took it, gently and swiftly. When it had tired, I steered it to my hand, and held it.''

The best yarn in the book has nothing to do with trout or even the wilderness. Before his searches began in earnest, Prosek diverged nearly eight degrees north of the 41st parallel to Paris. There he fished the Seine for weeks, trying for silure, a catfish of sorts. He surprised himself, to say nothing of bystanders and commuters, by hauling a 50-pounder onto the Île St.-Louis.
