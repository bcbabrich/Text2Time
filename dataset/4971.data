''It doesn't look too good,'' said Lee D. Brown, a cherry grower, as he looked out over his trees here on the banks of the Hudson River.

''The early cherries were hit bad, but the late ones may be doing okay,'' he said today on the eve of cherry-picking season in the Hudson Valley.

Mr. Brown's report reflects official figures showing production of both sweet and tart cherries would be down considerably this year in New York and throughout the United States when the harvest starts in about two weeks.

Based on reports from Mr. Brown and other cherry farmers, the State Agricultural Statistics Service in Albany reported that the tart-cherry crop would drop 35 percent in New York and 19 percent nationwide this year from last year.
