The Major Events of the Day

International

On his first day as Spain's acting chief of state, Prince Juan Carlos de Borbdn presided over a four‐hour Cabinet meeting yesterday that was mainly concerned with the worsening crisis in North Africa, where Algeria warned of war if Morocco continued her efforts to annex Spanish Sahara. Talks between Spain and Morocco over whether Spain would relinquish her dominion over Spanish Sahara were broken off. Meanwhile, a medical bulletin from Generalissimo Francisco Franco's physicians said that he had developed peritonitis, but that his coronary condition had improved. His vital signs were described as normal, and his “habitual lucidity” was being maintained, his doctors said. [Page 1, Columns 2‐3.]

The United States and Egypt were reported to he close to an agreement in principle under which Egypt would purchase American nuclear fuel, technology and power reactors. High Administration officials and Congressional sources said that they expected a formal announcement on Wednesday when President Anwar el‐Sadat of Egypt, completing a 10‐day visit to the United States, addresses a joint session of Congress.

Secretary of State Kissinger told the House Intelligence Committee that during his more than six years as National Security adviser to two Presidents, no covert intelligence operations had been undertaken by the United States without Presidential approval. His testimony followed that of James Gardner a former State Department aide, who told the committee Thursday that about 40 covert operations were approved by a four‐man subcommittee of the National Security Council, whose members never held a formal meeting. Mr. Kissinger said that Mr. Gardner had meant to imply that any of those operations had not been passed on personally by former President Nixon, he “mistaken.” [1:5.]

National

David Packard, chairman of President Ford's 1976 campaign finance committee, has resigned. He is a wealthy California conservative whose recruitment months ago was considered a political coup. He had been an ally of Ronald Reagan. His resignation was the second in a month by a high Ford campaign official. A campaign official said that there had been “some differences” about Mr. Packard's preoccupation with amassing contributions of $1,000, the limit under the 1974 campaign reform law, from customary Republican contributors. “There was a feeling that the money wasn't coming fast enough,” the official said. The campaign organization is seeking smaller contributions that would be matched by the maximum amount of Government funds under the new law, which provides matching funds for only the first $250 of a donation.
