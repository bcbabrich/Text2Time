The New Jersey Nets issued their first and only formal punishment of Coach John Calipari today, giving him a letter of reprimand for his profane ethnic insult of a reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark.

The Nets' chairman, Henry Taub, and the team president, Michael Rowe, met with Calipari, the coach and director of basketball operations, for two hours this morning, during which the incident was discussed and the letter delivered. It was the club's first official action since the incident on March 20, when Calipari, using a profanity, called Garcia a ''Mexican idiot.''

However, the team did not impose an additional fine on Calipari. Last week, Calipari was fined a record $25,000 by Commissioner David Stern, a move that may have been prompted by the Nets' inaction. The team's handling of the incident has been the subject of widespread criticism in the news media. ''We met today and everyone was very frank and honest,'' Calipari said after practice today. ''It was fair. I embarrassed the organization. But I think they understand who I am and what I'm all about. A lot of things were discussed. But obviously this last week's events were stressed a lot.''

During the meeting, there was no apparent move to force Calipari to relinquish some of his power and control that he asked for and received when he signed a five-year, $15 million deal with the Nets in June. Someone close to the situation said the matter had been discussed among some of the owners, but there was little the organization could do to take back any of the control they had given him in his contract. ''Management reviewed possible courses of action that were left to be taken,''
