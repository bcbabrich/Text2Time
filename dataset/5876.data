The need for a separate subsidiary meant that the new company had to be started from scratch. Some 700 office sites had to be found for the company, since American Bell employees could not share buildings with the rest of A.T.& T. Separate computer systems to handle billing and payroll had to be established, and new phones ordered for everyone.

Such a huge task met with some unexpected difficulties. For example, the New England Telephone Company demanded a deposit before beginning phone service for American Bell, despite the fact that both companies are part of A.T.& T. Headquarters in New Jersey

Because of its quick formation, American Bell could not find one building big enough for the head offices of the company and its divisions. So the company's headquarters will be in Morris Township, N.J.; the consumer products division, which will handle sales to residences and small businesses, will be in nearby Parsippany, and the advanced information systems division, handling sales to larger businesses, will be in Morristown, N.J.

To complicate matters further, about six weeks ago officials of Morris Township changed the name of the street where the headquarters will be located. Fortunately, the company had not yet printed a lot of stationery, said Robert E. McNulty, vice president of corporate planning and operations for American Bell.

American Bell officials, however, say the organizing is just about finished. ''I certainly think we're ready, absolutely without question,'' said Randall L. Tobias, president of the consumer products division. The company was apparently ready enough that Charles Marshall, chief executive of American Bell, and Archie J. McGill, president of the advanced information systems division, were taking vacations last week. Deficits at First

Whether the company is ready to compete is another question. With 28,000 employees and no customers, it is certain to start out losing large sums of money. Ivan L. Wolff, who follows A.T.& T. for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, estimates that losses in the first year might reach $500 million.

But the company will have great resources to draw on. Baby Bell officials hope it will reach about $2 billion annual revenues in either its first or second year. Its capital expenditures between 1983 and 1985 will be $5.1 billion, with most of that coming from its parent. And A.T.& T., which is expected to report 1982 revenues of about $65 billion and profits of more than $7 billion, is able to absorb the losses and investments without too much pain.
