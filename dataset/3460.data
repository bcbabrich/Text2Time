His doctor warned Joe Torre that his rate of recovery from prostate cancer would be unpredictable, that he could feel strong and vigorous one day and weary the next. Whereas Torre once thought he might assume his role of manager on the Yankees' current road trip, he said today that he was not ready and used two weeks as a time frame for his return.

It could be sooner, it could be later: Torre, still finding himself tired at day's end in the seventh week since his surgery, said he might manage next week, hopes he'll be back by the All-Star Game break, and is sure he'll manage again this year. The exact date? ''I don't know when I'm going to manage,'' said Torre, who watched the Kansas City Royals beat the Yankees, 13-6, tonight for the first time since Aug. 12, 1997.

Don Zimmer continues to manage the Yankees in Torre's absence in spite of the pain in his knees, and in spite of the fact that he called a team meeting earlier this week to inform players he would retire after yesterday's game. ''I'll be here until he decides to come back,'' said Zimmer, who answered questions alongside Torre today. ''Whether it be a day, a month, five weeks.''

Said Torre: ''Why don't you ask me again in two weeks -- that's what I'm thinking about, and if it's ahead of that, then it would be a nice pleasant surprise for me. I've never been through this, so I don't know what the timetable would be.''
