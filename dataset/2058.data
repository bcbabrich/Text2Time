Two columns in the June 30 issue of Wine Spectator provide a fascinating counterpoint in one of the most important aesthetic arguments in wine today. The first, by James Laube, one of the Spectator’s senior editors, takes a swipe at those who complain about the high alcohol content in many of today’s wines. “If you taste a wine and it seems to be balanced,’’ Laube writes, “the alcohol content shouldn’t matter.’’

That’s the standard retort from the high-alcohol apologists, and it’s not really what makes the column interesting, though it lets you know where Laube stands. No, what makes the column worth reading is his point that high alcohol levels are a necessary tradeoff for “plush wines with loads of flavor, body, texture and depth.’’

“For many of us more alcohol is an acceptable price for rich, flavorful, front-loaded wines that are engagingly complex and ready to drink the day you buy them,’’ he writes. He does allow that he would prefer wines in the 13.5 percent range, as in Bordeaux, rather than at the 15 to 17 percent level that many California wines are currently hitting. “However, in many other parts of the world, including California, many wines made at more moderate alcohol levels don’t have much flavor, and reds are often too tannic,’’ he says.

Now, I have to take issue with that last statement. My problem with many of the higher-alcohol wines, particularly those from California, is that they are overbearing. Too much flavor. Too jammy. Too sweet-tasting. Too powerful. Too plush. They taste the same and they don’t go with food. If you are used to eating steaks slathered with ketchup, mayonnaise and all manner of secret sauce, an unadorned steak may seem devoid of flavor – until you get used to eating that way again and your taste buds recover their appreciation for subtlety and nuance. To put it another way, a marching band will always outblast a piano trio, and if you are accustomed only to marching bands, you may not appreciate the trio.

Let’s be clear: Few people find high alcohol desirable in a wine. Some people find it a serious flaw. Others, like James Laube, tolerate it because they enjoy the big, rich style of these wines. But to suggest that it’s necessary in California rather than a stylistic decision on the part of the winemaker is plain wrong. Laube as much as says so himself. “We’re living through a phase, one of those periods where it’s fashionable to make the most expressive wine possible, and that will change,’’ he writes, “expressive’’ being a euphemism for big.

On that last point, I happen to agree with him. In the last five years or so, the pendulum has swung for California chardonnays. Of course, the tropical fruit, oak and buttered popcorn wines that were the defining style of the 1990’s are still widely available, but many winemakers have come back to leaner, less extravagant, more Chablis-like chardonnays. They have backed away from power and toward finesse. I think 10 years from now we’ll see the same thing happening with red wines.

By the way, while I don’t care for many high-alcohol wines, I don’t reject all of them. Many Châteauneuf-du-Papes exceed 15 percent, and some of them are great. I’ve enjoyed some big California pinot noirs and zinfandels. And last year I wrote about Diatom, a chardonnay from the Santa Rita Hills that was captivating despite its 16.2 percent alcohol. But on the whole I think balanced high-alcohol wines are fairly rare.

A colleague of James Laube’s, Matt Kramer, has certainly spoken up for finesse in the past, and in his column in this edition of the Spectator, he asks the rhetorical question, “Has pinot noir become boring?’’

Kramer, who is always one of the most thought-provoking wine writers, examines the uniformity of many New World pinot noirs, and points at the narrow selections of clones planted in many new pinot noir vineyards. Now, I know discussion of clonal selections is a guaranteed turnoff for many wine lovers, but I’ll ask your forbearance because I think Kramer’s point is important. The various versions of the popular Dijon clones all emphasize certain red and black fruit flavors, which produce a powerful sameness rather than the complexity that might result from mixing together other clones of pinot noir.

I’ve had the opportunity to taste wines made of different clones of pinot noir, grown in the same vineyard, and the differences can be astonishing. I remember one tasting session at the Hirsch Vineyards on the Sonoma Coast. David Hirsch poured wine made from a Pommard clone, which had great acidity and vibrant fruit as well as a slight herbaceousness and an elegance. Then a wine from the Mount Eden clone, which had a distinct raspberry flavor, and a different Mount Eden clone, which had a bright, brilliant cherry flavor. Then a Swan selection, which was dry, structured and powerful with complex fruit and herbal flavors. Dijon clones seemed powerful, too, but with less dimension. The best wine of all was made from the various clones blended together.

Kramer also addresses the important question of ripeness, which he calls “the single most important aesthetic decision today.’’

“Just when a grape is deemed ‘ripe’ has changed dramatically in the past decade,’’ he writes. “This has resulted not only in more alcoholically powerful wines but in more uniform-tasting ones, too. When a grape gets overripe it loses its more subtle flavor shadings.’’

Exactly what I’ve been saying, thank you. What’s especially disturbing is that pinot noir excels at making thrillingly subtle wines of great nuance. Instead, we’re getting what Laube approvingly describes as “dark, opulent New World cabernet or pinot noir brimming with broad, rich flavors and smooth fleshy tannins.’’

Jeez, do we really want to lump cabernet and pinot noir together like that? My guess is Kramer would say absolutely not.

I have to compliment the Spectator for publishing Laube and Kramer practically on adjoining pages in the magazine. Both men are far too gentlemanly to take a swipe at one another but if you close your eyes you can almost feel them throwing elbows back and forth.
