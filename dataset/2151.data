ATLANTA – The L.S.U. fans do not know whom to believe. Is Les Miles leaving or staying?

A report on ESPN earlier today declared Miles had accepted the Michigan job. In response to the report, Miles held a brief news conference before the Southeastern Conference championship and angrily declared he was the L.S.U. coach.

“I would say he’s gone,” said Brian Wall, an L.S.U. fan from Atlanta.

“He’s staying,” said Jimmy Dottolo, a nurse from Baton Rouge. “We need that stability.”

“We don’t believe anybody,” said another L.S.U. fan who did not want to give his name.

Before Miles’s abrupt news conference here, a reporter polled L.S.U. fans and 10 of 11 said they thought Miles was staying.

After the news conference, some L.S.U. fans were less sure because Miles did not say, “I am not going to Michigan.”

It is a big deal to these people who their coach is because they had a top-shelf coach in Nick Saban, but he left for the N.F.L. after winning a national championship at L.S.U. in 2003 and finishing 9-3 in 2004.

Miles arrived from Oklahoma State and is 32-6 in three seasons.

“If he leaves, we have handled worse,” said Elizabeth Bailey, a native of Slidell, La., who lives in the Atlanta area. “I just had a stepson move out of a FEMA trailer he’s been in since Katrina. It’s L.S.U., we’ll survive.”
