WASHINGTON, July 1—Seldom if ever has a President suffered the sort of one‐two punch with which the Senate smote Mr. Nixon on Tuesday —passing the Cooper‐Church amendment on Cambodia and overriding the President's veto of the health aid bill, 76 to 19.

(To be fair, the Senate on the same busy day also gave Mr. Nixon postal reform, which was a good piece of work, but by no means good enough to balance the President's score against the other two votes.)

Damaging Impact

In the first place, defeat has its own kind of damaging impact, aside from the substance of the issue. In vetoing hospital construction money, Mr. Nixon almost surely miscalculated, for instance, the temper of Congress; or, if he didn't he recklessly diminished the political power of his veto by expending it in a hopeless cause. Either way, the defeat is bound to have lessened the wary political respect in which a Congress, for best results all around, ought to hold a President; and in Mr. Nixon's case, there was already far too little such respect going for him on Capitol Hill.

The Cooper‐Church amendment was an even more serious blow, struck as it was in the foreign policy area, where every President since World War II has been able to operate with almost unchallenged authority. Again, aside from the substance of the amendment, the fact of defeat is damaging; despite his sustained opposition to the amendment, during which he even invoked the almost mystical notion of “the powers of the Presidency,” Mr. Nixon was unable to prevail. And in this case, the ineptitude of White House opposition made things worse.
