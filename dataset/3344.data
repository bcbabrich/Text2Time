They had to get their Kournikova fix. Kournikova fed their addictions -- and ended their fears of a second-round exit -- by cutting down her errors to erase a series of early service breaks. The instant she dismissed Sandra Kleinova, 6-4, 6-1, there was a sigh of relief on the grounds.

Although Serena Williams advanced to the third round in less than an hour last night, the afternoon was inundated with deep exhales by a couple of top women. Fourth-seeded Mary Pierce had to regroup after a series of careless forehands and mishandled volleys caused her to drop the second set against the youngest of the flying Maleeva sisters. But Magdalena, the sibling of Manuela and Katerina, could not sustain her run of five second-set aces, and Pierce went on to close her out, 7-5, 2-6, 6-1.

Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport also had a scare. For the entire first set, the nimble Kim Clijsters ran down Davenport's heavy ground strokes, transferred that incoming power into blistering passing shots and had her slower opponent on a futile chase around the court. But as Clijsters's drop-shots began to sit up too high, when she couldn't combat Davenport's rise in intensity, she left worn and defeated, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.

''It's a Grand Slam,'' said Davenport, who fought off a break point in the third game of the second set, then ran off five games in a row. ''I mean, I wasn't ready to walk out yet.''

Agassi left almost eagerly. Moments after his match, he walked into the interview room, listened to the questions and dispersed short replies. When asked if his heart was in the match, he said flatly, ''Yeah, very much.'' When asked if his recent back injury hampered his movement, he said, ''No.'' After being asked at what point he found out that his mother and sister were ill, he said, ''When it happened.''

Earlier in the week, and for the first and only time, he did discuss the health of his sister, Tammee, and his mother, Elizabeth, during an interview with the CBS tennis analyst Mary Carillo. At one point, he talked about how difficult it was to maintain his concentration.

Yesterday, that was evident. An initial hit of adrenaline -- which left him up 2-0 in the first set -- quickly petered out. On break point in the eighth game of the first set, Agassi failed to get his feet in position for a forehand that careened into the net. By the end of the first set, Agassi had lost 14 of 17 points.
