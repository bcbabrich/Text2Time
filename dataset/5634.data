At Public School 126 in the South Bronx, the story of Pinocchio being enticed into a coach driven by a man who transformed little boys into donkeys was used to illustrate the foolishness of succumbing to peer pressure and turning to crack.

A drug counselor at nearby Junior High School 148, using argot the students easily grasped, warned: ''Every girl listen to this. Don't let any boy, I don't care if he's got six pairs of Fila's on, or knows Sergio himself, or how much gold he's got around his neck, don't let any boy tell you - 'If you love me baby, you'll do it.' ''

In every school all over the city, from kindergarten through 12th grade, the city's 960,000 public school students spent the day writing and talking about the perils of crack, the potent cocaine derivative.

Students, who roared with laughter at the drug counselor's references to the popular Fila brand of sneakers and the reference to blue jeans manufactured by Sergio Valente, said afterward that they often came across empty crack vials in the apartment buildings where they live and on the streets where they play.
