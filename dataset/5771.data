FOR years, the identical Dunhill names created customer confusion, dismay and sheepish grins.

Consumers who bought expensive suits at Dunhill Tailors at 65 East 57th Street in Manhattan would call Alfred Dunhill of London's store at 620 Fifth Avenue (50th Street) to find out whether their suits were ready. Sale days at either store frequently brought eager shoppers to the wrong one. And people who wanted a particular brand of English tobacco would call Dunhill Tailors instead of Alfred Dunhill.

Now the problem is on the way to being solved.

Dunhill Holdings, the parent company of Alfred Dunhill, has agreed to buy the business of Dunhill Tailors for $3.25 million in cash and will continue that 62-year-old business ''for the immediate future.'' The acquiring company will research the full operations of the clothing company to determine what ''the synergies are with our own apparel business and make any adjustments that are needed,'' Anthony A. Greener, managing director of Dunhill Holdings, said in an interview in New York.

One similarity is obvious. Both stores are definitely in the luxury goods field.

Ready-made men's suits at Dunhill Tailors range from $500 to $750, and custom-made garments start at $1,800. Alfred Dunhill, which several years ago diversified into apparel, offers blazer jackets at $650 and men's slacks from $85 to $100. Celebrities and the superaffluent frequent both. William S. Paley, the founder of the Columbia Broadcasting System, and Milton Berle have their own cigar cubicles in Alfred Dunhill's second-floor humidor. Paul Newman, the Rockefeller family and other luminaries buy their clothes at Dunhill Tailors.

Founded in 1923 by William Block and his older son, Norman, as a retail clothing business on the fifth floor of 1 West 52d Street, Dunhill Tailors has operated for six decades under Norman Block, now 80 years old, and Leon Block, his 72-year old brother, who joined the company five years later. The single-store company has been at its 57th Street store since 1957. ''We're selling because of our age,'' observed Leon Block. ''We want to take things easier.''
