NEWS To the growing outrage of international conservation groups and the embarrassment of Chinese law enforcement agencies, the international ivory trade is booming, with much of the smuggled ivory ending up as statuary and jewelry in Chinese showrooms and private collections. Critics say the Chinese government is not doing enough to stem the illicit ivory trade, which has exploded in the five years since conservationists and governments agreed to a program of limited ivory sales intended to stifle poaching and revive a centuries-old handicraft. In the past year, more than 32,000 elephants have been illegally killed, according to the Born Free Foundation, a wildlife organization, and conservationists say the vast majority of ivory sold in China is of questionable origin. Dan Levin reports from Puzhai, China.

The unemployment rate in the euro zone edged up in January to a new record, official data showed Friday, as the ailing European economy continued to weigh on the job market.

For Thomas Minder, a decade-long crusade against “fat cats” is coming to a head. The Swiss are set to vote Sunday on whether to adopt his proposal to impose some of the world’s most severe restrictions on executive compensation.

Raphael Minder reports from Geneva.

ARTS The art scene in Kosovo reflects the country — fragmented, young and just beginning to define itself. Countries like Russia, China and Spain do not recognize Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia five years ago. Kosovo’s participation as a country pavilion at one of the world’s premier art events is certain to ruffle some feathers. Ginanne Brownell reports.

SPORTS From the moment last Saturday’s Premier League game between Arsenal and Aston Villa began, goalkeeper Brad Guzan was in constant motion. For Guzan, every moment on the field is golden. He was a backup for most of the past four seasons, a holding pattern that tested his persistence and cost him his place on the United States national team. This season he has finally established himself as Aston Villa’s starter, but the journey has been long and hard and, at times, even a little embarrassing. Ravi Ubha reports from London.
