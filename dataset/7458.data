“Negroes have made virtually no progress in the craft unions in Hollywood,” Mr. Hill contended. “All that can be said about these unions is that, in some instances, there have been some token concessions.

“Since these are closed unions that have closed‐shop contracts in the industry, the attitude of these unions is a clear violation of the National Labor Relations Act.”

Mr. Hill declined to say what additional steps would be taken but he has indicated in the past that intervention by the Government might be asked.

The craft unions include electricians, carpenters, propmen and cameramen, among others.

In many ways, these unions are the most powerful labor force here. Some of their leaders have indicated indifference, even hostility, to the association's campaign.

Union officials have pointed out that they have serious problems with unemployment and could not be expected to increase their memberships now. They also have said that new Negro members could not be expected to turn in work performances equal to those of members with more experience and seniority.
