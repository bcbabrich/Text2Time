President Bush will extend formal recognition to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia on Monday regardless of whether the Soviet legislature acts to grant Baltic independence by then, Administration officials said today.

The officials said that although Mr. Bush had been withholding formal recognition of the three republics, out of deference to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he had decided that he is giving Soviet legislators enough time to act.

"We wanted to give them a respectable grace period so if we had to act on our own, nobody could complain that we did it precipitously," one official said.

The American officials' comments today appeared to be a clear effort to prod Soviet legislators. The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies meets in Moscow on Monday. It would have a full working day to act even if Mr. Bush were to make such an announcement as early as mid-morning on Monday here, because Moscow time is seven hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time.
