A LITTLE cheese biscuit from Brazil called pao de queijo is quietly building a big following in Manhattan. Baskets of the golden, puffy biscuits are showing up in trendy Latin restaurants, from Churrascaria Plataforma in midtown to Coffee Shop, the Brazilian cafe on Union Square. But the ones made at Good and Plenty, the catering and takeout shop at 410 West 43d Street, are particularly irresistible.

''People go crazy for the biscuits; I can never serve enough,'' said Eileen Weinberg, the owner, who credits one of her cooks, Maria Helena Ramos, with the recipe for pao de queijo (pronounced PAOWN de KAY-ju), which means ''bread of cheese'' in Portuguese.

Ms. Ramos, who is from Belo Horizonte, Brazil, makes a variation of the traditional recipe, a combination of manioc flour, mild Parmesan cheese, eggs and milk.

The manioc flour is what makes these biscuits different from the usual wheat flour or yeast varieties, which, depending on the skill of the baker, tend to be either flaky or leaden. Manioc flour is ground from a tropical tuber called cassava. It makes a temperamental dough -- as sticky as molasses and as stretchy as a rubber band -- but it is responsible for the distinctive, spongy texture of the biscuits.
