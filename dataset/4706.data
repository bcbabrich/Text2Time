To the Editor:

Three centuries ago, when the Roman Catholic Church opposed Galileo's theory of the earth moving around the sun (front page, Oct. 31), the Earth continued to move around the sun. Today, the imprudent opposition of the Vatican to safe, efficient contraception, in an era when AIDS is widespread, unfortunately can adversely affect the lives of millions of women and men and children. The world cannot wait three centuries for a reversal. ROSE E.
