EVERYONE seems worried about an exodus of high-skill jobs from the United States to third-world countries. But those fears are probably misplaced.

While some such jobs are moving overseas, the American economy will generate many more at home. And a lot of the jobs that go overseas will be more in the nature of 4 a.m. technical support for personal computers. Americans benefit from that, too. The savings from that phone center in India are built into your new $350 PC.

There is no great shortage of jobs in this country anyway. Unemployment is at a level that, a generation ago, would have been considered hard to achieve without significant inflation. Immigrants continue to pour in, and to find work. Well-educated Americans will do just fine; foreigners are so confident in our economy that it is the beneficiary of huge capital inflows.

Indeed, the real threat to the American economy is not competition from successful foreign lands but the enormous drag imposed by countries that cannot produce the kind of strong, consistent growth required for global prosperity. A world that depended for so long on American military power for political security now depends on American consumer spending for economic security, and I suspect that this new dependence will prove just as troublesome. Over the long run, it's probably not sustainable.
