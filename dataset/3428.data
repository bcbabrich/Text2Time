Seven months after he announced that he was leaving office, President Carlos Saul Menem says he will run for re-election if his supporters can legally overturn a constitutional ban prohibiting a third consecutive term.

Mr. Menem's aides say that he is convinced that the country needs him in office to resist the financial contagion spreading from neighboring Brazil and that he is committed to negotiating a treaty with the United States during the next few years that would replace the peso with the dollar as Argentina's currency.

''If there's a possibility of running in the primaries, I'll do it,'' Mr. Menem said in a radio interview on Friday.

Mr. Menem remains far behind in the polls, and, with the ruling Justicialist Party's primary vote due in May or June and the general election scheduled for October, he may be running out of time. But since he was first elected as a dark-horse candidate in 1989, he has repeatedly surprised analysts with his political resourcefulness and cunning.
