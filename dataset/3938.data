In scenes that could have been lifted from a science-fiction movie, work crews in airtight white suits and purple gas masks scoured two East Side neighborhoods yesterday, seeking to capture asbestos fibers that had been released a day earlier, even though officials said the risk to passersby was negligible.

Health experts said that the suits worn by cleanup crews reflected the substantial hazard posed to people who work with asbestos or chemical contamination on a daily basis; they were not an indication that the public was in danger.

Nevertheless, ever since a geyser of steam and asbestos burst from a Consolidated Edison Company steam pipe just before noon on Tuesday, a few yards east of Third Avenue on 56th Street, and later a city water main break left traces of asbestos along a stretch of Fifth Avenue at 26th Street, New Yorkers have been grappling with conflicting impressions of the hazard, if any, posed by the incidents.

Their confusion was heightened when city officials and Con Edison, the owner of Manhattan's maze of steam pipes, encouraged people who might have been exposed to the tiny pink fibers to shower thoroughly, and Con Ed asked witnesses to the steam rupture to turn in clothing that might have been contaminated.
