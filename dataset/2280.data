And now, the latest leads in the seemingly uncrackable case of lonelygirl15, YouTube heartbreaker.

(Bree, just tell us who you are! We’ll support you!)

+ A lawyer in Encino, Calif., filed to trademark "lonelygirl15" on August 21, 2006. The first commercial use of the trademark is listed as May 24, 2006.

+ Together with the facts, now well-established, that fan sites and other relevant urls with the string "lonelygirl15" were registered in advance of the appearance of the first lonelygirl15 video on YouTube, this trademark filing appears to confirm suspicions that "lonelygirl15" is not a simple vlog memoir by a homeschooled teenager, innocent of commercial connections.

+ The most recent lonelygirl15 video, however, seems to refute the hypothesis that the videos were shot at once some time ago, as in "Bree

the Cookie Monster" Bree cites the comments section of YouTube, Daniel has longer hair than in other vids, and Daniel appears to be holding a copy of the current issue of Rolling Stone magazine. (NB: some propose that the cover was Photoshopped in. Wow.)

+ The crack forensics team on the lonelygirl15.com forum seems to have established that lonelygirl15’s indoor videos are being made somewhere around Mountain View, Calif. CuriousBotanist proposes that some of the plants in the outdoor video, "Swimming," only grow in California.

+ The reporting of Jon Fine at Business Week has convinced him that a troupe of tatterdemalion troupers made "lonelygirl15," the series, as part of an art project or a bid to get noticed. It’s a tender thought. People, including me, who once believed Bree was merely "sweet" and telling the whole truth, now like to hope that she’s at least a more or less autonomous artist, as opposed to a pretty monster made of Pixar CGI trying to sell us things.

The following figures have denied responsibility for "lonelygirl15"to me. They say they admire the videos and the curiosity they’ve piqued, but know almost nothing about their origins or the identity or location of Bree and Daniel.

+ Chad Hurley, CEO of YouTube

+ The filmmaker Brian Flemming

+ The filmmaker Chris Wilcha

+ "Laguna Beach" cameraman Hisham Abed

+ Haxan ("Blair Witch") master Mike Monello

+ Jane McGonigal, ubiquitous game designer and games researcher

+ Jane Jones, an actress whose admittedly generic name is also one of Bree’s aliases

In short, the videos are almost definitely more than simply "sweet." The Encino lawyer must know something. And Mountain View, Calif., which is near YouTube‘s headquarters, is a place to think about.
