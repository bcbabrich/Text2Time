Sales of existing homes declined 2.2 percent in January, as rising mortgage interest rates and the usual winter lull combined to reduce sales to their slowest pace since last summer, a real estate trade group said today.

The National Association of Realtors said resales of single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.48 million units in January, compared with 3.56 million one month earlier. It was the slowest pace since the rate of 3.44 million last August.

Surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation show that the interest rate on fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages rose from 9.83 percent to 10.05 percent during January.

The association's survey found the median price of an existing home to be $96,200, up 4 percent from December and 7.1 percent from January 1989. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
