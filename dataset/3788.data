Baffled New Yorkers continue to wonder how bureaucracies like the school system and the child-welfare agency lost 8-year-old Justina Morales, who was allegedly killed more than a year ago by her mother's boyfriend. Part of the problem was poor interagency communication. The Giuliani administration is now taking welcome steps to improve coordination between the Board of Education and the Administration for Children's Services.

Teachers and principals are required to report suspicions of child abuse or neglect -- suspicions that might be aroused by prolonged absences. That did not happen in Justina's case. It also did not happen in another school district, that failed to notice prolonged absences of four school-age siblings of Nadine Lockwood, a 4-year-old whose mother allegedly starved her to death. Child-welfare officials might have intervened more effectively if the two agencies had connected.

Henceforth, the agencies will each designate staff workers to serve as liaison between the two agencies, supplying relevant information like attendance records and names of teachers and aides who might be helpful. Child-welfare workers will also be able to tap into the board's computers. But that will help only if the city can overcome its abysmal history of prolonged delays in getting computer systems up and running.
