FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — Take a deep breath, everyone – it’s Friday.

Much like Jean ARP at 51 Across, Tim Croce has done some artful configuring in today’s puzzle, which has a slew of never-before-seen words that make solving it a breath of fresh air.

Lieutenant of the musketeers D’ARTAGNAN makes his grand debut today, which seems surprising because his comrades-in-arms Athos, Porthos and Aramis are used as crossword answers fairly often. (A check-in at the XWord Info’s Hall of Records shows they’ve been used a combined total of 50 times since 1993.) Being a member of the three musketeers has its benefits, but three cheers for Tim for bringing D’Artagnan some glory.

Another newbie comes at 61 Across, with a phrase clued as “like real danger.” Those who survived the LSAT might remember the answer from a Supreme Court opinion, but this particular turn of phrase had a franchise life after it retired from law, and it titled a best-selling Tom Clancy novel and a Hollywood film.

There’s an environmental undercurrent today, as you might expect after filling in GAIA. While you’re birdwatching at 18 Across and 62 Down, don’t neglect the wildlife underfoot — there’s a baby salamander, or EFT, hiding down below. It’s an unusual ecosystem, though, with SIROCCOS blowing over the SHORE. (Bert the Turtle, of “Duck and Cover” fame, might feel out of his element there, but he’d feel at home filling the screen at 16 Across.)

While you solve a puzzle that includes both Kansas and dust-laden winds, I hope you enjoy this song:
