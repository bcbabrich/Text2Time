Following are excerpts from the conclusion of the report by the Commission on the Year 2000, which was appointed by Mayor Koch to study New York City's future:

The 21st century can be a time of New York triumphant. We see a city that is civil and beautiful; a city of flourishing neighborhoods, productive and efficient; a city that is the world city in business, finance, communications, technology and the arts; a city that offers opportunity, as it has for the last three centuries, to all who come here. All of this is possible if we respect the complexity of the city, build on the best of the city's past, understand the problems of the present and chart a clear course for the year 2000.

Truly being a world city, a city of neighborhoods, a city of opportunity and a civil city will require the commitment and common purpose shown during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. And it will mean remembering what that crisis was all about: New York City cannot spend more money than it has; it must be competitive within its region, and its region must be competitive with other metropolitan regions in the country. Yet at the same time, as we look to the future, our vision cannot be so constrained by the recent past - a past defined by the fiscal crisis - that we lose sight of the opportunities ahead. * * *

Poverty must be faced as the city's most serious and pressing problem. New York is the most exciting, vibrant, thrilling agglomeration to be found anywhere, in any field - finance, science, sports, culture, the arts.

''New York is the greatest city on the face of God's earth,'' said Brendan Behan, ''. . . view it any way and every way - back, belly and sides.'' Yet viewed from beneath, New York's greatness turns to grimness. It is the grimness of poverty that troubles us more than any other problem, a grimness that spreads its tragedy not just to adult but to children as well. Almost 40 percent of the city's children live in poverty and if we are serious about the future of the city, we must be serious about the future of these children.
