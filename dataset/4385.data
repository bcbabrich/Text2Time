In 1926, when he was 12 years old, he walked into a Washington bookstore with his parents, dipped into Crowe and Cavalcaselle's "North Italian Painting" and was never the same again.

He did not have, and never sought, any formal training in art history. But at Downside, a Benedictine school in England, he pursued his newfound vocation in every spare moment. Later he had a rigorous training as a political and intellectual historian at Balliol College, Oxford.

After graduating in 1935, he sold some islands off Borneo that had been bequeathed to him by an uncle and spent the money on two years of private art-history study in Europe.

He traveled, he looked, he thought and he wrote. He also listened to senior art historians, many of them refugees from Nazi Germany, and learned much from their methodology, their standards of interpretation and their sometimes hilarious quirks. He could also characterize them in just a few words, as when he referred to the "gentle, dogmatic, unpersuasive voice" of an art historian who aspired to mate Marxism with 15th-century Italian art.

A new challenge always amused him. When appointed to the staff of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1938, he applied himself with memorable effect to the study of English portrait miniatures, whose distinction was underrated at the time.

After five years' service in air-force intelligence during World War II, he returned to Europe in 1944. Never a blinkered specialist, he was one of the first Englishmen to report in print on recent work of Matisse and Picasso in the Salon d'Automne in liberated Paris.

When he rejoined the Victoria and Albert Museum, he stipulated that he be assigned to a department of which he knew nothing. Many years later, he spoke almost with nostalgia of the ramified obligations that had come his way in great miscellaneous museums, where he had had to deal with "everything from Victorian brass lecterns to filthy plastic bags full of the mummies of Peruvian children."
