This finding was as perplexing as it was intriguing. The men all had jobs, and equal access to health care under Britain's national health system. But mortality rates for men in the lowest civil service classification, the researchers found, were three times higher than those for men in the highest grade. And a 25-year follow-up of the Whitehall subjects, some results of which were published in 1996, found the social class gradient persisted well past retirement, even among men into their late 80's.

Subsequent studies demonstrated a similar relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality in the United States and Canada.

What could account for such startling findings? One plausible explanation was that lower-ranked men might engage in more risky behaviors, like smoking. But the same health disparity from pay grade to pay grade that was evident in smokers held for nonsmokers, too. And all coronary risk factors combined, the researchers found, accounted for only a third of the differences between grades.

Stress, or other aspects of psychological life that can have an impact on a person's vulnerability to disease, the Whitehall group reasoned, might also play a role in the results. Prolonged exposure to stress, researchers have found, can lead to abnormalities in immune function and glucose metabolism, and destroy brain cells involved in memory. And studies show that the lower one's social status, the more stressed people feel, and the more stressful events they encounter in their lives.

Dr. Sheldon Cohen, professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, has demonstrated a link between social status and vulnerability to infectious disease in male macaque monkeys. In a study carried out in conjunction with primate researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Dr. Cohen found that males at the lower end of the dominance hierarchy were more susceptible to a cold virus than dominant males.

Dr. Cohen and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon then replicated those findings in humans. Subjects in the study were asked to rate their relative standing in their community on a social status ladder, then were exposed to mild respiratory virus. People who ranked themselves low on the ladder were more likely to become infected with the virus than those who ranked themselves higher up on the ladder.

In another study, the researchers found that people who had been unemployed for one month or more under highly stressful conditions were 3.8 times more susceptible to a virus than people who were not experiencing a significant stressful situation.
