Congress now seems certain to approve before the end of this session - in an election year at that - perhaps the most extensive revision of the income tax code in history. But it's not clear who, if anyone or any party, should be able to claim the political credit.

To many observers and commentators - including this one - that problem seemed largely irrelevant a year ago, and even after passage of the House version of the tax bill. The question seemed rather who would be blamed for the failure of tax reform.

Now the Senate has acted too and the only step remaining - difficult but surely surmountable - is the Senate-House conference that will iron out differences between the two bills and make important decisions about effective dates, etc. So once again the question arises as to where the most political profit should accrue.

There will be much to take credit for. No matter what the conference decides, top tax rates for individuals and businesses will be drastically reduced. Though some of the ''simplification'' that was an original goal has been lost, the annual task of filling out a tax return may be significantly easier for numerous Americans; for many at the lowest economic levels, there will be no tax to pay at all.
