Fed Cup Move Suits King

Recruiting just got a little easier for Billie Jean King, the Fed Cup captain, now that the April 17-18 confrontation between the United States and Croatia has been moved from Zagreb because of security concerns in the Balkans.

After ruling out Hamburg, Germany, as an alternate site, the International Tennis Federation announced its approval of the move to the United States, presumably to a clay court site in Florida or the Carolinas. But King disclosed Tuesday that regardless of where the match is played, neither of the Williams sisters will be on the team.

Venus repeated as the Lipton champion on Sunday by ending the 16-match unbeaten streak of her younger sister in the final.

Last year the sisters used schoolwork as an excuse to skip the Fed Cup, and they also implied that, as Jehovah's Witnesses, they were precluded from putting their country ahead of their God when they took to the court. But their father/ coach, Richard, appeared to volunteer them for duty during one of the news conferences he gave at the Lipton.

''I love America, so if I could play the Fed Cup and represent America, off, I'm gone,'' said Williams, who, unlike his daughters, is not a Jehovah's Witness.

King seemed perplexed by the Florida-based family's stance on the Fed Cup.

''First the Williamses said yes and then they said no,'' King said. ''I don't know what's going on there, but it's a little too late to worry about it now. Your first priority is to get a team together that really wants to play.''

King already had a commitment from the second-ranked Lindsay Davenport and anticipates that the venue change will enable Monica Seles to join the team. King was disinclined to ask Seles, an ethnic Hungarian raised in Serbia who lives in Sarasota, Fla., to compete in Croatia or in Hamburg, the city where she was stabbed in midmatch six years ago.
