Coming up also is the first of three weekends to take children to Caramoor. Each of the ''Trio of Fairy Tales,'' which is sponsored by General Foods, will be given four times - on Fridays and Saturdays at 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. The first is ''Pinocchio'' on July 6 and 7. It is followed on July 13 and 14 by ''Hansel and Gretel,'' both of those featuring the life-sized puppets and marionettes of Puppetworks.

Then on July 27 and 28, Artreach, an award-winning touring theater company, brings a live production of ''Rumpelstiltskin'' to the Spanish Courtyard.

For reservations to any of the above Caramoor events, call 232-5035.

The 13th year of free events at the Untermyer Performing Arts Festival is about to begin at the historic Untermyer Park in Yonkers. The first of the six 8 P.M. Saturday concerts presents the Haydn-Mozart Chamber Orchestra. The attractions in subsequent weeks are to be ''The Traveling Russian Village,'' two dance evenings, a choral program and the Opera Northeast production of Puccini's ''Madame Butterfly.'' Saunders Auditorium is the rain location; for more information, call 964-3513.

Although a number of summer festivals emulate the Untermyer by alternating dance and concert events, Music in the Mountains seems to be the only one offering them in a single evening. This experiment in interdisciplinary programming was tried successfully last year, so now there will be two such mixed evenings, this Saturday and July 21 on the New Paltz campus of the State University of New York.

At the first of these 8 P.M. concerts, the Festival Chamber Players share the spotlight with Sarah Stackhouse and Dancers, the program listing Ravel's Duo for Violin and Cello, the Bartok Contrasts, Joan Tower's ''Wings'' for solo dancer and clarinet, and George Crumb's eerily fascinating ''Voice of the Whale,'' the last with new choreography by Ms. Stackhouse. On July 21, the Chamber Players team up with members of the Jean Erdman Theater of Dance (257-3872).

Well worth the trip are the Maverick Concerts in Woodstock, N.Y., which are celebrating their 75th anniversary season with 10 Sunday afternoons of chamber music in a sylvan setting.

Next week, at 3 P.M., the violinist Charles Libove, the cellist Roberta Cooper and the pianist Nina Lugovoy will re-create the first Maverick program, of July 9, 1916, when the music list included piano solos of Schumann and Chopin, Christian Sinding's Suite for Violin and Piano, the Valentini E major Cello Sonata and trios of Beethoven and Arensky.

Among the subsequent performers of renown this summer are the Emerson String Quartet (on July 22), the flute-harpsichord duo of Paula Robison and Kenneth Cooper (Aug. 5), and Brass Ring (Aug. 12). The grand finale on Sept. 2 brings members of the Composers String Quartet and the Dorian Wind Quintet together for the world premiere of an octet by Peter Schickele, one of five works commissioned to help celebrate Maverick's Diamond Jubilee season.
