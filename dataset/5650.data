She realizes now, she said, that what she thought at the age of 13 - that the father would stay around, that they could hold together a family - was largely irrational. ''I was a little child, but I didn't look like 13,'' she said. ''I had a body like I was older, I did talk to everyone as though I was older.''

She said she did not use birth control before her first pregnancy. Afterward, she took the pill, but ''I didn't take it right.''

She would get together with her boyfriend - ''he always wanted to be the best guy around the block'' - when his mother was out of her apartment. ''She would go with her boyfriend and I would go to her house with her son,'' Ms. Collado recalled. ''He had a five-room apartment. It was real nice, we had something going.''

She said she would usually leave his house by 9 P.M. so she could get back before her mother, then a nurse's aide, came home from work.

When Ms. Collado delivered her first child, her mother left work to look after him and, later, the second child. ''She had to stop to look after the kids,'' Ms. Collado said. ''Now she has arthritis. My mother gets welfare for me, my sister and the two babies. When I get home from school, I do my mother's job of looking after the kids.''

Around her neighborhood in the north Bronx, she sees little changing among her friends.

''Basically the whole block is all young girls with kids,'' she said. ''They're all young, 14 or 15. The oldest one is my best friend, she's 17 with a 1-year-old. She did it to get out of the house. The youngest girls sleep with anybody they can get. To me, they want to be like everybody else. Some of the girls say: 'I slept with this guy.' It's like they did something real big. They're just wasting their time. Who's going to want them?'' Motherhood Gives 'A Reason for Living'

Like Roseann Collado, Sherri Woodford, a 19-year-old student at West Side High School, an alternative school in Manhattan, said she became pregnant on purpose, hoping that she could transform a tumultuous home life.
