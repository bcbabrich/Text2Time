Herring for Luck

In the South, black-eyed peas are the food for New Year's Day. In Tuscany it's lentils. In Eastern Europe, herring is a traditional symbol of good luck. These days, the people of that region those need all they can get of both luck and herring.

For New Yorkers who want to try herring for a better 1992, one long-established source for the fish, in a variety of styles, is Russ & Daughters, 179 East Houston Street (near Allen Street). The store has been in business since 1914. It is now featuring lightly salted matjes herrings, imported from Holland. The silken-textured herrings are $2.99 each and will be filleted to order.

The store also sells fat Icelandic schmaltz herrings, cured in salt, for $2.25 each, or $1.25 for a single fillet. German-style rollmops stuffed with onions are $1.99 each. Ruddy Swedish matjes herrings with their sweet cure are $1.95 for a fillet; they come in the store's own brown sugar and cranberry sauce. Pickled herrings -- plain, in cream sauce or mustard sauce -- are $1.75 each and chopped herring is $5.99 a pound.

Russ & Daughters is open today from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. Normal hours are 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. seven days a week; (212) 475-4880. Park Slope Patisserie
