THE keyboardist and composer Wayne Horvitz and the guitarist and composer James (Blood) Ulmer unveiled two entirely different approaches to music at the Bottom Line Saturday night. For his records, Mr. Horvitz, who sounds as happy swinging through be-bop as throwing notes around with the saxophonist John Zorn, constructs perfect musical miniatures. The tunes hint at references: funk bass lines, ethnic percussion patterns, pretty melodies and an upwardly mobile, slick veneer allow him to draw a listener in, all the while fiddling with the forms of the music.

Mr. Horvitz will start a melody half-way through a tune, or let a composition sparkle without a melody at all. Rhythms permutate without setting a solid beat, and though the music begs solos, Mr. Horvitz rarely comes up with any. Though it proposes pleasure, ultimately the music asks you to delay, or imagine, gratification; it is contemporary.

Mr. Horvitz brought his band the President to the Bottom Line. Where a studio allows his works the precision and detail they demand, the stage does not, and Mr. Horvitz has wisely compensated by opening up the tunes somewhat for solos from the band, which includes Doug Wieselman on saxophone, Elliott Sharp and Dave Tronzo on guitars, Dave Hofstra on bass and Bobby Previte on drums.

But he hasn't opened them up to where the compositions can fully breathe. Earlier, less restrained shows caught the group steaming like a roadhouse band, full of Meters-ish, greasy grooves and East Village noise solos to peel paint with. On Saturday, at the second set, only Mr. Sharp's brutal, texturally abrasive solos made the group sound distinct - it suffered from the ring rust of not playing often enough, and Mr. Horvitz's compositional restraint read, at least momentarily, as politeness.
