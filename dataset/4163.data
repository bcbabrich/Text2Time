A white supremacist charged with improperly buying bubonic plague cultures by mail pleaded not guilty today.

The defendant, Larry Wayne Harris, 43, of Lancaster, entered the plea at his arraignment in Fairfield County Common Pleas Court. Mr. Harris, who has said he belongs to white separatist groups, said he had been developing antidotes for the plague because of the potential invasion of germ-carrying rats from Iraq.

He had been indicted on charges of forgery and receiving stolen property after the authorities said he misrepresented himself when he obtained freeze-dried bubonic plague cultures from a Maryland laboratory.
