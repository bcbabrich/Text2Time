Congressional Republicans offered qualified support Tuesday for President Obama’s proposed troop increase in Afghanistan but several senior Democrats took sharp exception to the president’s plan, illustrating the deep divide in the party over the conflict.

“I see no good reason for us to send another 30,000 or more troops to Afghanistan when we have so many pressing issues – like our economy – to deal with in this country,” said Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the Rules Committee.

The resistance by the Democrats demonstrated that Republican backing for the troop build-up plan will be crucial to compensate for Democratic defections, making it likely that Republicans will provide the margin for approval when the added troops are subject to a Congressional vote, probably in the form of a spending bill next year.

While top Republicans welcomed what they portrayed as a belated decision by Mr. Obama to meet Pentagon requests for more troops, they also raised objections to any withdrawal deadlines or Democratic talk of new taxes to pay for the military effort.

“Setting a draw-down date before this surge has even begun is a mistake, and it sends a mixed message to both our friends and our enemies regarding our long-term commitment to success,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.

Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, voiced similar complaints earlier Tuesday and aired them again in a White House meeting with the president on the war plans, officials said.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader who has differed with the president on almost every issue this year, said he would support Mr. Obama’s plan but warned against a deadline.

“As this surge of forces produces results in security, governance and in capabilities of the Afghanistan Security Forces, we must ensure that the transition of responsibilities is based on conditions, not timelines,” Mr. McConnell said.

Other Republicans said they needed to take a closer look at the details of the strategy and monitor upcoming hearings.

“Today we received a broad overview from the president about his plan for Afghanistan,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. “This is a complex issue and plenty of questions must still be answered. The most fundamental is whether this plan will help us achieve success.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a noncommittal statement on the speech, saying “the American people and the Congress will now have an opportunity to fully examine this strategy.”

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, was more supportive, saying Mr. Obama “made a convincing case that sending additional troops to Afghanistan to fight Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is critical to our national security.”

But the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a close ally of the president, said he was not yet ready to render judgment.

“President Obama asked for time to make his decision on a new policy in Afghanistan,” Mr. Durbin said in a statement. “I am going to take some time to think through the proposal he presented tonight.”

Other Democrats quickly weighed in against the troop increase, making it clear they were prepared to break with the president. “I support the president’s mission and exit strategy for Afghanistan, but I do not support adding more troops because there are now 200,000 American, NATO and Afghan forces fighting roughly 20,000 Taliban and less than 100 al Qaeda,” said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California.

Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who converted to the Democratic Party earlier this year, also came out in opposition, saying he was not persuaded that additional troops in Afghanistan would defeat Al Qaeda.

“If Al Qaeda can operate out of Yemen or Somalia, why fight in Afghanistan where no one has succeeded?” Mr. Specter said.

Democratic officials acknowledged there is serious unrest among Congressional Democrats over Mr. Obama’s plan and said his build-up proposal is being greeted as something of a surprise even though as a candidate the president made clear he intended to shift military resources from Iraq to Afghanistan.

Other Democrats quickly moved behind the president’s strategy.

“I think the president has a sensible plan, both short- and- long term, to empower the Afghan people and allow for U.S. troops to complete their mission and come home,” said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. “The plan will allow 50,000 additional Afghan troops to be trained by next July so they can hold areas that are turned over to them.”

Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, said: “No one wants to send more money or more American soldiers to Afghanistan, including me. But we were attacked from that country, and 3,000 innocent Americans were killed. We must do what it takes to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a platform for attacks on the United States.”
