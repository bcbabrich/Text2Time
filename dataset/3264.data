''It seemed like a concept that had never been done, or done correctly,'' said Jennifer Fine, 28, a co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Smartees Inc. ''We get e-mail from parents saying, 'Thank you for letting my daughter focus on what she wants to be when she grows up, not just on what she wants to wear.' ''

One expert still sees room for improvement. ''The more varied the roles that girls see women in, the better it is for girls,'' said Joan Jacobs Brumberg, a Cornell University historian and author of ''The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls.'' But, she added: ''The critical thing for me is that they don't all look just like Barbie. Until such time as we can make professional women unglamorous, or low-upkeep, where their power doesn't depend on their hairdo or their high heels, then I think we are sending mixed messages.''

Mrs. Fine, who displayed pictures of herself in college with long blond tresses -- she called it her Barbie look -- started the company with Jennifer Hamlin, whom she met at a cocktail party, after they found themselves commiserating about shopping for dolls and finding none that they identified with. They tested a number of concepts with children (one idea, Sarah the Senator, bombed right off the bat), and rolled out the first dolls in October. Their motto? ''It's not what you look like,'' Mrs. Fine said, ''it's what you do.''

Not wanting to miss the dress-up boat, Mrs. Fine and her partner came up with an approach that they thought made putting on a little glittery outfit more ennobling. The Smartees can be modified to wear evening gowns, like a one-shouldered purple satin number, but they wear them because they have to attend a charity ball to raise money for some worthy cause, Mrs. Fine said.

That fell flat with one analyst. ''I hope the kids can grasp that subtlety,'' said Sean McGowan, who has followed Barbie for years for the investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison. ''The level of maturity that is required to understand that a charity ball is not just a party is probably beyond the age group that likes dress-up toys.''

Ms. Chavez said she modeled the four Get Real Girl characters on friends of hers. One doll is African-American, for example, another is part Asian. Each promotes a different sport, and when their Web site, www.getrealgirl.com, is up and running, their stories will be detailed there. While their muscle tone contrasts with Barbie's, the dolls have similarly idealized features. Their motto is ''Be your own role model.''

To develop the line, Ms. Chavez joined forces with Michael Cookson, founder of Wild Planet, a San Francisco toymaker. She still seems somewhat surprised to be in the toy business. ''I wish I had gone into the movement, because I am so passionate about human rights,'' she said, referring to her cousin's farm labor work. Instead she finds herself in the doll aisle and at trade shows, trying to persuade store buyers to stock her company's products.
