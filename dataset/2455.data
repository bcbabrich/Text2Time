OF all the seasons, autumn can be the most fickle. With the arrival of in-between weather -- warmer than winter but spiked with rain and frigid breezes -- an insulated vest comes in handy, particularly for those who prefer to exercise outside.

Thanks to innovations in fabrics and design, today's outdoor vests are light, sleek and practical.

Here are five that run the gamut from ultralightweight to bulky.

Keep in mind, a heavier vest is not necessarily a warmer one. Base your choice on what kind of exercise you'll do while wearing it. CHRISTIAN DeBENEDETTI

Cloudveil Inversion, $135, www.cloudveil.com (available online in mid-September). This vest's exterior is tough, water-repellent nylon, making it a sound choice for skiers and casual hikers alike. Inside is pillowy 650-fill down, enough to keep a person warm in a cold wind. Yet at only 10 ounces, the vest is light, and it can be stuffed into a grapefruit-size sack (included).
