'Didn't Do It for Love'

Directed by Monika Treut

Not rated; 82 minutes

One thing you can say about Eva Norvind, the flamboyant subject of Monika Treut's documentary film ''Didn't Do It for Love,'' is that she has never stayed in one mode for very long. When she was still a teen-ager in the early 1960's, the Norwegian-born actress took a bus from New York to Mexico with only $10 in her pocket. She quickly established herself as a blond, buxom star in a series of Mexican B-movies and worked as a prostitute whose clients included a number of prominent Mexican politicians. Later she participated in a scheme to smuggle television sets into the country.

After appearing on Mexican television advising women about birth control and creating a scandal by exhibiting herself on the streets in a bikini, Ms. Norvind was officially deported from the country (but remained secretly), and had an illegitimate daughter.

Moving to New York City after winning a scholarship to study film at New York University, Ms. Norvind established a raffish literary salon of sorts and under the name Ava Taurel became a professional dominatrix administering punishment and humilation to a mostly male clientele (many of her clients were lawyers, she recalls) at $300 an hour. As business boomed, she began teaching workshops in dominance and submission and appeared on television talk shows.

All this frenetic change is more than one modest 80-minute movie can comfortably encapsulate. The person shown in the film clips of Ms. Norvind when she was a Mexican movie star bears hardly any physical resemblance to the severe gray- haired woman of today, who in the movie's black-and-white film clips of her practicing her sadomasochistic trade fits the 1940's movie stereotype of a menacing prison matron.
