These days, we have seen it all on the Discovery Channel. And the Amazonians have seen us. Now, they wear jeans and Reebok knockoffs and take aspirin instead of leaves for a headache. The new exhibition contains 6,000 plants, most from the Americas, where most of the garden's botanists work, and many of the new specimens come from their cuttings and seeds. It also tries the near-impossible task of digesting the collision of the two worlds these scientists regularly traverse.

It's a noble pursuit, but I miss some of the old jumble. There were so many plants crowding against the 90-foot-high ceiling of the central dome, it was like the Heart of Darkness. There were no signs to help the uninitiated, though the inquisitive could usually find the plant's metal tag, with its Latin name, by rummaging in the bushes. The rain dripping from the canopy was not the artful aftermath of a tropical rain -- as it is now -- but actual rain leaking through the glass. There was a wonderful gloom, a bit of decay that lent the mystery of the unknown: the kind of unfathomable wild place that haunted Joseph Conrad and all those other colonialists.

But now, one is ''immersed'' (to use a catchword of environmental education) in a journey through plants that are used as teaching tools. One cannot help but learn from the sign by the cycad in the central dome that this early seed-bearing plant once roamed the world with the dinosaurs. Visitors carrying Acoustiguides, which look like cellular telephones, can hear from botanists in the field: how the weevils that pollinate these cycads are being destroyed by pesticides and development, or how a graceful palm that once thrived in Bolivia is being wiped out by the world's appetite for its succulent hearts of palm.

Botanists are the new heroes, and they are pictured, a bit too often, outside their flooded tents, crawling across tree branches in the Andes (collecting seeds and cuttings of wild blueberries for the Agriculture Department), taking notes as shamans tell the secrets of medicinal plants. But the plants are the true stars, from the exquisite to the weird.

The visitor can stand under the cecropia tree in the lowland rain forest and watch the light falling through its giant starlike leaves, then read how its leaves are steeped in tea to treat high blood pressure and diabetes. Or stare, if no one else is looking, at the mottled, malodorous, testicle-like flowers on the vines of an aristolochia, or Dutchman's pipe.

There is a strange sense of deja vu along the way, as if the familiar house plants from Grandmother's had suddenly grown to the size of Volkswagen bugs -- in exuberant flower. This is part of the plan.

''We wanted a great variety but also common things people could relate to,'' said Francisca Coelho, the curator of tropical plants, who, over the last four years, has propagated thousands of plants.
