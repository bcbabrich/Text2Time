So Adrienne von Lates, the museum's curator of education, and Ms. Hernandez put together a curriculum of four two-hour workshops that could easily be offered at each center. To date, the program has served some 400 girls.

Appearing scarcely older than a teenager herself, Ms. Hernandez, 25, is quick to establish a rapport with each group, a relationship somewhere between mentor and big sister. The first hour is like a college-level art history class: she gives an overview of the artists being discussed, shows slides and opens the room to discussion. The language in the reading material on the artists is sophisticated; as the girls read it aloud, and Ms. Hernandez reviews any words or ideas that are difficult.

"A lot of these girls suffer from low expectations," she said. "I really come at them expecting a lot, and very often they will meet me at that level."

In the second hour, the teenagers work on an art project inspired by an artist they have just studied and that usually involves photography or collage. At the Village, one of the Lorna Simpson pieces, "Stereo Styles" (1988), consisted of 10 photographs of African-American women depicted from behind in identical dress, with only the hair styled differently. Running along the bottom of the serially mounted photos was the text: "Daring, Sensible, Severe, Long & Silky, Boyish, Ageless, Silly, Magnetic, Country Fresh, Sweet."

The girls then each found a partner so they could photograph each other's hair from behind. "It's this idea of what hair says about you," Ms. Hernandez told the girls, many of whom had been playing with each other's hair before the workshop began and greeted the project with enthusiasm.

One girl was concerned that her hair fell under the "boyish" category. "I think Lorna Simpson's talking about labels, and I think she's criticizing those labels," Ms. Hernandez said. Another chose to focus on the wildly curly tips of her subject's brown hair; another zoomed in so closely on a bun it seemed abstract.

A popular art project in the program is based on a series of collages in which the Kenya-born artist Wangechi Mutu cobbled together pieces of advertisements from beauty magazines and assembled them to create disfigured women as a way of questioning cultural ideals of perfection.
