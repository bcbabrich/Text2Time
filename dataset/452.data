The Neon Demon

June 24

They say modeling is a tough business, but most newcomers donâ€™t have as much trouble as Jesse (Elle Fanning) when she moves to Los Angeles to get her start. There she finds women who will do anything (horror-movie anything) to take her youth and beauty. With Christina Hendricks, Keanu Reeves, Jena Malone and Bella Heathcote. Nicolas Winding Refn wrote and directed.
