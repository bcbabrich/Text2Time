THE corroding copper mansard on top of the building at 86th Street and Riverside Drive has long been a curiosity. Now a co-op shareholder is sprucing up the 100-foot-long space into what will surely be one of the show apartments of New York.

But even completed, the new apartment will only be a small fraction of what it was in its original incarnation: the largest apartment in New York City, William Randolph Hearst's custom-built quintuplex.

In the 1890's the young Hearst came to New York, buying The Morning Journal in 1896 and battling Joseph Pulitzer's World for circulation. He later launched The Evening Journal and by 1908 had major newspapers in five cities. Hearst also served as a Representative in Congress and stoked his appetite for politics with campaigns for Mayor of New York City, Senator, Governor and even President -- none of them successful.

In April 1907, when he was living in a brownstone at the corner of 28th Street and Lexington Avenue, the Real Estate Record & Guide reported that he would build a mansion at the southeast corner of 105th Street and Riverside Drive. But Hearst, perhaps seeing that Riverside Drive's days as a street of private houses had ended, soon arranged with Ranald Macdonald, a developer building a conventional 12-story apartment house at the southeast corner of 86th Street and Riverside Drive, to take over the top and possibly other floors in the building.
