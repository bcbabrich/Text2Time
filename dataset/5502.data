BORN TO PAY: The New Politics of Aging in America. By Phillip Longman. (Houghton Mifflin, $19.95.) Phillip Longman is a young writer and Washington activist who worries a lot. He believes his generation, baby boomers born from the mid-1940's to the early 1960's, are destined for hard times indeed. Pulling together worst-case scenarios drawn from Census Bureau projections, testimony to Congress, books and articles, he warns that many of his contemporaries will end up old and poor. In his view, middle-class women are especially vulnerable. Social Security and Medicare will either be bankrupted or drastically reduced, because we are not saving to pay for the vastly increased numbers who would qualify under present laws. Young people who waited to start families until their late 30's will discover, when they grow old, that the working population will by then be too small and poor to support them. He warns of an ethnic gulf in some parts of the country, with elderly whites looking in vain for support from a largely black and Hispanic working population with other priorities. And everybody, young and old, will be staggering under the trauma of Government debt. Mr. Longman's approach has been denigrated as ''granny-bashing.'' He argues that age-based entitlement, notably Social Security, should be replaced with programs limited to the needy. These should be financed by taxes on consumption, with incentives for savers to help support the elderly, and for potential parents to alter the demographic curve. Mr. Longman addresses real issues, but his analysis is skewed by his experience in the fiscally erratic Reagan era. New taxes and reductions in swollen defense budgets might clear away at least some of the shadows in his crystal ball.
