To the Editor:

What explains the current violence in Burundi? "Specter of Hate Stalks Burundi, Too" (news article, April 26) focuses on two causes: President Melchior Ndadaye's assassination last October and the assessment by Sylvie Kinigi, who was Prime Minister under Mr. Ndadaye and briefly head of state, that "a democratic system [ was ] thrust upon her country too abruptly" by the Belgians. This perspective, however, overlooks one driving influence: genocide.

In two years of research with Burundi refugees in Tanzania, I observed how the genocide, carried out by the Tutsi-dominated Burundi Government in 1972-73, continues to captivate Burundian thoughts.

It could hardly be otherwise: in 1972, responding to an armed Hutu uprising, President Michel Micombero, a Tutsi, violently eliminated a generation of educated Hutus from Burundi, drove hundreds of thousands out of the country and enacted measures to discriminate against surviving Hutus. Apartheid-like conditions prevailed until quite recently in Burundian society.

The wound that genocide inflicted on Burundians has festered for two decades. Government-induced ethnic repression polarized post-genocide Burundi along the Hutu-Tutsi divide, and Burundians have used the genocide to validate their respective ethnic histories and demonize the opposition.
