Mr. Moyers noted that most of the community's moderates did not want to be interviewed on film. “And they claim the violence of a few bomb‐throwing racists has obscured their case,” he said, adding, “what they are afraid of, they say, is this&. “ The camera, on a tight closeup of Mr. Moyers, then pulled away for a wide and dramatic shot of utter devastation. Mr. Moyers explained: “This is the ghetto of South Jamaica, also in Queens, just three miles from Rosedale. It's a familiar story. Once residential and almost all white, now South Jamaica is the home of 70,000 people most of whom are poor and black. Almost half of them earn less than $4,000 a year, 30,000 live on welfare. As the neighborhood tipped, the crime rate soared. It is 1,600 percent higher than in Rosedale. More than 9,000 crimes were committed here last year….

This was uncomfortable, legitimately frightening fact, not racist bilge. Learned studies might indicate that contempt for authority and rising crime rates are merely the inevitable results of assorted contemporary pressures, but the residents of Rosedale (and South Boston) look at nearby vicinities and attribute appalling disintegration to blacks, all blacks, ironically without discrimination. The older white residents recall the halcyon days of “melting pot” living (i.e., a “beautiful, white ethnic community”), when doors were left open, windows didn't have to be barred, the streets were safe at night. The newer residents are literally refugees from areas like South Jamaica. areas like East New York and the South Bronx. They have run once; they are reluctant to run again.

The result is unavoidable confrontation and heartbreaking tragedy, both for the moderate whites implicated by their silence in the brutality of bomb‐throwers, and the struggling, middle‐class blacks smeared and at the same time cowed by the excesses of some of the black “underclass.” In better, more reasonable times, each group might realize that their differences could be far less important than their shared interests. But, for the present, the bitterness continues to expand rapidly. Ending with a minor street incident between white and black youngsters, the documentary captured a terrifying glimpse of irreversible hate being nurtured in fragile psyches.

Perhaps the mere moving away from overly easy charges of racism can provide some glimmer of hope. Different angles, new theoretical crevices are being explored. Michael Novak, writer and teacher, has been provocatively and valuably defending the white ethnics. In this paper recently, he speculated about the resentment “working‐class Catholics tend to feel over the alliance between rich, highly educated and powerful whites and the black underclass.” He wrote: “It is as though an alien upper‐class society has decreed that advances for the black underclass should come chiefly at the expense of working‐class whites, while the privileged give up nothing at all.” Interestingly, Mr. Moyers struck a similar chord in his conclusion: “& the struggle goes on. The people with money, status and power have bought their way out&. Black and white alike in the Rosedales of America have been abandoned, condemned together to economic apartheid, by a system that rewards the people who can get out, and condemns to bitter consuming rivalry those left behind. It is a travesty whose consequences will haunt and may one clay overwhelm America.” Mr. Moyers has provided a powerful cue fur further TV exploration of tough, perhaps explosive but doubtlessly crucial story.
