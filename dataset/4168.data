IT is a rare mutual fund that manages to suffer a double-digit percentage loss in a single day -- even a day when the stock market has a small swoon.

Even more unusual is a fund that racks up such a huge loss because of a single stock.

But leave it to the American Heritage Fund, which on Tuesday dropped 11.4 percent, while the average aggressive growth fund fell just 1.2 percent. American Heritage, which scored spectacular gains in the early 1990's, had staggering losses last year and is down 27 percent so far in 1995, generally a banner year for stock funds. And it achieved a certain notoriety because of its involvement with Spectrum Information Technologies Inc., a former high-flier that filed for bankruptcy protection in January.

The latest chapter in the American Heritage story serves as a reminder to investors that it pays to take a quick peek at the list of what a fund owns, and to look out for heavy holdings of what are known as restricted stocks. Such stocks cannot easily be sold; indeed, there is often no market for them at all, leaving it up to the fund to assign them a value.

Ever since the 1960's, when the mutual fund industry suffered scandals over restricted securities, such stocks have been fraught with peril for fund investors. And so it has proved for the owners of American Heritage, which makes no bones about its penchant for investing in stocks in which there is little or no trading.
