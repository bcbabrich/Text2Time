Getting people to quit smoking may be hard, but discouraging them from starting, at least when they are young, may be as simple as raising the taxes on cigarettes.

A new study reports a link between the price of a pack of cigarettes and the likelihood that a teenager will start smoking. After surveying a total of 12,000 8th- and 10th-grade students for seven years and taking into account the local price for cigarettes, the researchers concluded that a 10 percent increase in price decreased the odds of teenagers' starting smoking by as much as 10 percent.

The study was conducted by ImpacTeen, a research partnership at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and by researchers from the University of Michigan. Based on data collected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the project was part of a long-term study into substance abuse among children.

The researchers said the study helped resolve a debate over whether cigarette prices affect the number of teenagers who begin smoking. Previous studies showed that higher prices did decrease the number of children smoking and the amount they smoked.
