The Giants reached the 47-man roster limit today by waiving 16 players, including 35-year-old Ottis Anderson and 30-year-old Gary Reasons, who both helped them win two Super Bowls.

But on the National Football League's final cutdown day, what you see is not always what you get. Anderson, the oldest running back in pro football, is almost sure to be re-signed this week, probably on Tuesday or Wednesday. He would be ready to play Sunday in the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers.

Reasons, recovering from a sprained left knee, agreed to accept four weeks' pay (about $150,000) as an injury settlement. If they need an inside linebacker later in the season and Reasons has not signed with another team, the Giants could bring him back.

All N.F.L. teams today had to reduce their rosters to the regular-season limit of 47. To get there, the Giants dropped four of their veterans -- Anderson, Reasons, Roger Brown, a third-year defensive back, and Bobby Abrams, a third-year outside linebacker. They cut loose Jeff Carlson, a quarterback signed in March as a Plan B free agent. He will keep his $125,000 signing bonus. Three Draft Choices Are Gone
