Twenty-two Civil War and Lincoln scholars and historians released a statement yesterday saying the charges of plagiarism against Prof. Stephen B. Oates "are totally unfounded."

The charges were brought at a symposium of the Illinois State Historical Society last fall by Prof. Robert Bray of Illinois Wesleyan University. Professor Bray said parts of Professor Oates's 1977 biography of Lincoln, "With Malice Toward None," were plagiarized from "Abraham Lincoln" by Benjamin Thomas, which was published in 1952. Professor Oates, of the University of Massachussetts, at Amherst, denied the charges.

In a statement released yesterday, the 22 scholars and historians said, "We find no evidence of the appropriation of either the ideas or the language of other scholars without attribution -- the only legitimate test of plagiarism."

Signers of yesterday's statement included C. Vann Woodward of Yale University, David Donald of Harvard University, James M. McPherson of Princeton University, John Hope Franklin of Duke University, Eric Foner of Columbia University and William S. McFeely of the University of Georgia.
