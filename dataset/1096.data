“We had higher expectations than anybody in the N.F.L., I would say — at least anybody that’s willing to talk about it,” tight end Dustin Keller said.

Much of that swagger begins with Ryan, who strode to the lectern afterward with his eyes sunken and red. At the day’s outset, the Jets owned a 10.4 percent chance of making the playoffs, according to Football Outsiders, and needed an unlikely confluence of events in Houston, Cincinnati and Denver or Oakland to turn in their favor — but they needed to defeat Miami first. A man with an answer for everything, Ryan said Sunday’s loss, with pride and postseason hanging in the balance, was difficult to explain, although in Sanchez’s performance he identified a reasonable starting point.

Once celebrated for his ability to perform under pressure, Sanchez has committed three turnovers in each of the Jets’ last three games, all losses. Even if, as Ryan asserted, Sanchez was without a doubt the Jets’ “long-term solution,” they could hardly be encouraged that his three interceptions Sunday all came on checkdowns to his third or fourth receiver.

Two of those came on consecutive fourth-quarter possessions, including Marvin Mitchell’s interception that all but clinched Miami’s victory — Jets ball at the Dolphins 10, trailing, 16-10, and 3 minutes 10 seconds remaining. In the end, Sanchez completed two more passes to Randy Starks, a Miami defensive lineman, than he did to Holmes.

“I’ve got to play better for us to win,” Sanchez said.

As much as the Jets vowed that this week would be different — for Sanchez, for the maligned offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, for unsatisfied fans — it was not. An offense that staggers and sputters for 15 games does not suddenly awaken in the 16th. Though their first touchdown drive was nearly flawless, balancing execution with imagination, their other six possessions before halftime resulted in four three-and-outs; a field goal drive that entailed four momentum-stalling false-start penalties and two burned timeouts; and Starks’s first interception, which led to a Dan Carpenter 58-yard field goal that sliced the Jets’ lead to 10-6. In the second half, their four possessions went punt, interception, interception and touchdown, a 10-yarder to Patrick Turner that was rendered meaningless when Miami recovered the onside kick.

“All year long,” Moore said. “Penalties, turnovers, lack of focus and attention to detail and things like that. It’s been going on all year. It showed up again this game.”

Moore’s appraisal seemed an indictment of some teammates and the coaching staff, both of which will be strenuously evaluated. Keller said Ryan, in his postgame speech, told the Jets to examine themselves as players and teammates. “You can have all the greatest individuals in the world,” Keller said, “but if they’re not great team players, you’re not going to win anything.”

If the Jets opt to overhaul their staff, Schottenheimer, responsible for an underachieving group, appears the likeliest candidate to go. His unit actually outgained Miami, 374-210, just another confounding statistic in a season loaded with them. The Jets finished with more regular-season road losses (six) than in their previous two years combined. On Sunday, they held Miami to 97 net yards in the first half, intercepting Matt Moore twice, but had all of 10 points to show for it.

That output was not nearly enough, not on a day when the Jets’ defense failed them in a way not fully seen since Tim Tebow’s stirring game-winning drive in Denver in Week 11. Leading, 10-6, midway through the third quarter, the Jets had the Dolphins pinned deep in their territory. And then Moore engineered a drive that left them dumbstruck and desperate, converting all six third-down opportunities. Taking over at their own 6, the Dolphins marched 94 yards in 21 plays, consuming 12:29, to take a 13-10 lead. In response, Sanchez threw an interception, and the Jets’ collapse was all but complete.

Not that they would agree, but missing the playoffs might have been the best thing for the Jets. It forces them to examine their roster, the staff and the schemes instead of perceiving the team as being merely one victory from the Super Bowl. That was a year ago. These Jets had too many flaws to be champions and, as was revealed Sunday, too many flaws to make the postseason as well.
