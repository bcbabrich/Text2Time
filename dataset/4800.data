Here she comes, the New York Woman! Street smart. Ambitious. Sexy. A young urban survivor, who never, never leaves home without her American Express gold card.

Or so New York Woman magazine, which is published by the American Express Publishing Corporation, would have its advertisers believe.

In an unusual attempt to revive its sagging advertising, the 110,000-circulation magazine will guarantee advertisers in its December issue a circulation of 300,000 women. The additional 190,000, who will get the December issue in the mail at no cost, are American Express gold card holders who charge at least $3,000 a year in retail sales to their cards. Access to Millions of Names

Like its sister publications within the American Express family, the five-year-old-magazine, which publishes 10 issues a year, has access to the millions of names in the parent company's formidable data base. These data tell how many times a card was used and the amounts paid and have enough verified information about how the woman shops to make any media director drool. Holders of gold cards are the biggest spenders in the data base.
