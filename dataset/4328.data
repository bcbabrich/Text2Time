Columbia Records' show, part of the JVC Festival at Bryant Park, ambled along amiably on Wednesday afternoon, even under the persistent threat of rain. It opened with the group Black Note, a quintet of young musicians from Los Angeles that takes its inspiration in part from early Wynton Marsalis, meaning its harmonies are modern and a bit acidic. The group set up a changing background for solos, a static chord for one improviser, swinging rhythms for the next. They sounded a bit like a student group, earnest young improvisers moving through their prearranged lines and ideas and never really improvising. The music rarely moved beyond the polite.

The guitarist James (Blood) Ulmer followed. Over the years he has become a self-parodist. He sings on most of his songs now, in a deep, near-Jimi Hendrix growl. Occasionally he played odd and beautiful guitar solos, metallic and compressed. He saved his most ambitious piece for last, a composition that moved from swinging sections to hard rock and never ventured into the banalities of his singing. Mr. Ulmer's sound and his harmonies, pumped through an electric guitar and overdriven amplifier, are sulfuric at times, chilly at others. He's distinct, though his concerts hardly ever let an audience know what he's capable of doing.

David Sanchez, the young Puerto Rican saxophonist who has recently released a fine album, "The Departure" (Columbia), came on next. Mr. Sanchez is one of those rare musicians who, with a combination of a thick and soft tone and supple rhythms, make audiences want to follow his improvisations. His material, mostly original, plays to his strengths, moving from rhythmic pattern to stasis, then moving on again. And he regularly changes instrumental combinations. On Wednesday he waited for the new rhythms and pounced, repeating two-note ideas until the entire band was jumping and hopping. Mr. Sanchez is a master at drawing his band into collective improvisation.

The trumpeter Terence Blanchard, whose group closed the concert, can be one of jazz's more dramatic soloists, and, like Mr. Sanchez, he is working on a distinct sound for his band. Mr. Blanchard has recently released a new album, "The Billie Holiday Songbook" (Columbia), and he started out with "Lady Sings the Blues," unfolding a solo that blended strangled and wrenched sounds with broad, open notes.
