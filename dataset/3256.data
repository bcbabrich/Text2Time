Cybershop.com, an Internet retailer that decided to close its principal Web site after disappointing sales at the end of last year, said yesterday that it had a loss of $4.4 million, or 50 cents a share, in the final quarter of last year.

Jeffrey Tauber, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with investors that he was very excited about the company's new direction, which involves its effort to become an ''Internet incubator'' that will help promising young companies.

Mr. Tauber and his family sold $7 million of stock in November, at prices from $10 to $10.61 a share. He defended those sales in the conference call yesterday, saying they were proper and came at a time when he expected that ''December results would be quite strong,'' although they turned out to be so disappointing that the company decided to close its original venture, cybershop.com. Shares of Cybershop.com fell 93.75 cents yesterday, to $3.9375 in Nasdaq trading before the financial results were released.

Mr. Tauber, in a telephone interview, said there was no reason for the company to have disclosed in November that sales of its cybershop.com Web site had fallen in the third quarter. He said that disclosure, made in an amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, was required only because the company had later decided to discontinue the operation.
