''Narcissistic vulnerabilities,'' as psychoanalysts refer to them, make people particularly sensitive to how other people regard them. ''You see it in marriage, in friendships, at work,'' Dr. Ornstein said. ''If your boss fails to smile when you greet him it may create a withdrawn, anxious feeling. If so, your self-esteem has been hurt. A sturdy self absorbs that; it has a bank account of self-esteem, so it's not unbalanced. But if you're vulnerable, then these seemingly small slights are like a large trauma.''

On the surface, extreme narcissists are often brash and self-assured, surrounded by an aura of success. Indeed, they are often successful in their careers and relationships. But beneath that success, feelings of inadequacy create the constant need to keep inflating their sense of themselves. If they do not get the praise they need, they can lapse into depression and rage. The Workaholic's Reward

Admiration, rather than the pure pleasure of doing things well, is what propels narcissists to their success, psychoanalysts say. Thus many workaholics put in their long hours out of the narcissist's need to to be applauded. And, of course, the same need makes many narcissists gravitate to careers such as acting, modeling or politics, where the applause is explicit.

Many difficulties in intimate relations are due to narcissism, according to David A. Berkowitz, a psychiatrist at Tufts University.

''Narcissism makes someone vulnerable to the least failure to be loved or accepted just as they are by their partner,'' Dr. Berkowitz said. ''Marriage brings to the fore all one's childhood yearnings for unconditional acceptance. A successful marriage includes the freedom to regress, to enjoy a childlike dependency. But in marriage a couple also tend to re-enact early relationships with parents who failed to give them enough love. This is particularly hard on those with the emotional vulnerabilities of the narcissist.''

Narcissists tend to surround themselves with people will will laud them rather than give criticism when it is needed. They are drawn, too, to the trappings of success, such as automobiles or houses that announce their worth to the world. Narcissists find in them support their grandiose sense of themselves.

Narcissists are typically charming and friendly. Their own intense need for adulation makes them sensitive to the same needs in others, and so they are particularly adept at ingratiating themselves. But there is a hidden agenda to their friendliness: they are interested only to the extent that their own self-importance is fed by it.
