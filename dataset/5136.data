Before word of Colonel Higgins's death, there was a quality of bravado in public comments over the apparent ''coup'' in Sheik Obeid's abduction. Over the weekend and through this afternoon, Israeli officials spoke as one, reflecting the view offered by Ehud Olmert, a close, Cabinet-level adviser to Prime Minister Shamir, who called the abduction ''the purest form of justice.''

But by tonight, after word of the killing, officials here had grown defensive.

Foreign Minister Moshe Arens was asked whether Colonel Higgins's death had been Israel's fault. ''That is the sort of argument Hezbollah itself would use,'' he responded, using the Arabic name for the Party of God. ''They are the only ones to blame for this kind of act.''

The Foreign Minister bristled at suggestions that some in the United States might blame Israel for the colonel's death.

''I don't give any credence at all to these reports,'' he said. ''Israel and the United States stand together in the fight against terrorism, have done so in the past, and will do so in the future.''

Israel television's evening news program gave long and detailed attention to the reaction in the United States, including footage of Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, speaking on the Senate floor, saying:

''I hope the Israelis will take another look at some of their actions, which they must know in advance endanger American lives. Perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelis one of these days would be refreshing.''

Near midnight, the Defense Ministry released a statement detailing what it said were the initial confessions it had wrung from Sheik Obeid, now under interrogation somewhere in Israel, The statement said the Muslim cleric had admitted he was ''personally involved in planning, directing and assisting in'' the kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers, a car-bomb attack against Isareli forces in southern Lebanon and ''the kidnapping of Colonel Higgins and his transfer to Beirut.''

Previously, he had denied involvement in Colonel Higgins's abduction. U.S. Not Told in Advance

Mr. Rabin said today that Israel did not inform the United States before it abducted Sheik Obeid last Friday. But he also said that Israel was thinking of the American hostages, and that was one reason for the offer of the prisoner exchange. United Nations officials say Israel is holding about 300 Lebanese in detention centers in southern Lebanon.
