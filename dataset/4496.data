IT is time for food lovers to sing an enthusiastic happy 10th birthday to Mirabelle. A decade ago, the small French restaurant in an unobtrusive converted house on Route 25A in St. James skyrocketed in popularity and is still there.

On a recent visit, comments by first-timers were telling. On entering the dining room, one asked, "Is there another room?" Another added, "It's not what I expected."

Mirabelle is neither large nor imposing. The dining room is subdued, tasteful and comfortable. Nosegays of flowers and votive candles top the tables. Soft lighting from old-fashioned wall fixtures bathe pale peach walls. Green ceramic plates, a few small pictures and a floral arrangement placed beside an antique gilt mirror set the stage.

Decor is not what Mirabelle is about. The marvelous food created by Guy Reuge, the chef and owner, is the star here. The supporting players are the waiters and waitresses, who provide consistently splendid service.
