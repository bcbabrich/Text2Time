Merry Christmas. Get lost.

That, essentially, was the message Robert Pagein received from his employers -- make that former employers -- at Verizon Communications.

Mr. Pagein, who is married and has a year-old son, was a field technician who had worked for the phone company for four years. One of the lures of the job was its stability. The pay wasn't great, but it was steady. If you were disciplined you could pay your bills, take a vacation every year or so, and put a little aside.

That's the way it works in theory. In reality, Mr. Pagein was one of 2,400 Verizon workers in New York who were shown the door just a few days before Christmas. Those workers formed the bulk of a pre-holiday wave of terminations that claimed the jobs of 3,500 Verizon employees in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.

Mr. Pagein will not be destitute. His wife is working and he has a college degree. But the cold-blooded way in which he and his fellow workers were lopped off the employment rolls by Verizon, and the phenomenal gap that exists between the compensation available to the company's ordinary workers and the fabulous, multimillion-dollar packages taken home by executives at the top of the Verizon pyramid, has shaken his faith in a system he believed in.
