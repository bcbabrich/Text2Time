Polish hams, vacuum packed, were on sale today on one street corner for 1,023 rubles, and a downtown store was selling five kinds of smoked fish at prices ranging from 25 rubles a pound to more than 50. There were no lines there, nor were there any at the market where cucumbers were being sold at 70 rubles a pound and more. Champagne, sold in the commercial stores, was going for 120 rubles a bottle and more, while a bottle of vodka cost 100 rubles.

"How can I buy anything at the market when I can't afford what is in the stores?" lamented Mrs. Vrublevskaya's neighbor Lena, who with her husband supports their family of four on 700 rubles a month. "How can it be a proper New Year's?" she asked, tears in her eyes. 'We Are Slowly Dying'

Nobody knows for sure what the prices will be on Thursday, but Mrs. Vrublevskaya, who depends on word of mouth for her news, said people in lines were saying that a loaf of white bread would cost 5 rubles and a loaf of black bread 4 rubles. The current price is about 40 kopecks.

The economists hope that a jump in state prices will bring in new shipments of goods and food, and restore some balance to a now deeply unstable pricing system. But Mrs. Vrublevskaya, who is cheerfully fatalistic, sees no reason to hope.

"We are slowly dying," she said with great calm, "just as the Bible said we would. The only expectation is for things to get worse. Either there will be a civil war or we will all burn together, as it is written in the Apocalypse."

But more immediately, Mrs. Vrublevskaya lives in constant dread of falling ill, or becoming destitute and losing the children to an orphanage. Abandoned by their mother, her daughter, the two children are entirely dependent on their grandmother.

When she was released from the hospital, Mrs. Vrublevskaya was given instructions that, in the current situation, were almost laughable. The doctors advised her to eat four or five dried peaches a day, but with dried peaches selling for 50 rubles a pound, she sees no way of following their advice on this and on other matters.
