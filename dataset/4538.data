THE injuries that sidelined Wendell Davis of the Chicago Bears and Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins this year could have been prevented, says an inventor who has come up with a new approach to football cleats.

Harry Max Weiss, 60, a patent attorney and sports fan in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he had formulated his invention, patented last week, while watching instant replays of players being injured on "Monday Night Football."

Mr. Weiss said football shoe cleats, which provide traction and give better footing, also prevent the shoe from moving when a player is hit. The torque when a player is hit, he said, is the cause of many injuries, especially to the knee, which among National Football League players is the body part most likely to be hurt.

"The players' feet are planted in one direction and their knees are being pushed in another direction," Mr. Weiss said. "It's clear you need a way to release the cleat."
