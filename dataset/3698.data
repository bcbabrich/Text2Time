To the Editor:

An Aug. 30 Week in Review article places the onus for our global economic problems on lack of political leadership, citing a number of academics but no economists. The economist Milton Friedman recently appeared on ''Moneyline News Hour With Lou Dobbs'' to deplore the role of the politically controlled International Monetary Fund, saying that it has aggravated the economic situation rather than improved it. He called for market solutions, not political solutions.

Adam Smith's invisible hand is less dramatic than a magic wand, but economics has not taught us to do magic tricks with our economy. Capitalism is capable of self-correction and continuing economic progress, while collectivist, political alternatives have proved to be no answer at all.
