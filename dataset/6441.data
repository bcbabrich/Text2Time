There is nothing “spare‐time” about the energy and determi nation Mr. Kretchmer is ad dressing to the job, beginning with early morning visits to borough and district head quarters throughout the city and ending with nighttime in spections of various neighbor hoods.

There has also been a major reorganization of the depart ment, the most important as pect of which is the appoint ment of two career civil serv ants, Harry Scharaga as First Deputy Commissioner for Op erations, and James Scully as Chief of Staff. Together, they represent seventy years of pro fessional experience in that de partment. Their promotions indicate a recognition that the use of professionals from the ranks at the command level is absolutely vital to improving productivity.

Your readers should be as sured that nothing is “drift ing” in the. Sanitation Depart ment. A great deal is happen ing: the Mayor is increasing the work force in the depart ment by 1,500 sanitationmen this year—the largest increase by far in the history of the de partment; pick‐up schedules are being regularized for the first time in years; far‐reaching operational improvements are being planned and will be in stituted quickly; new equip ment and new litter baskets are on the way to deal with spe cial problems; a citizens’ com mittee has been revitalized, through the Mayor's Council on the Environment, to produce more public cooperation.

In short, a determined effort is being made to come to grips with an enormously complex technological problem in the midst of an unprecedented rise in refuse in the biggest city in the nation.

Program for ‘70's

To the Editor: For 35 years Irresponsible spending by Federal, state and local politicians has constantly edged us toward the brink of total bankruptcy. This has de veloped an environmental cli mate enabling hippies to attack with impunity fundamental prin ciples and traditional virtues that made America great.

Voters who cherish life, lib erty and our right to pursue happiness can make the seven ties sensible. We must defeat profligate politicians at every election and elect instead only freedom loving patriots who will enforce basic economy throughout all levels of govern ment.

Unless we change course within this decade, our good Ship of State may actually per ish in the fathomless depths of permissive liberalism. If that should happen, courtesy, de cency, integrity and responsible society will surely vanish from this earth.
