Gov. George E. Pataki made his first comments about Ms. Stubbs on Monday night, saying he knew of "all that she does to help Libby with all of her political events that are very helpful," and was not aware of any impropriety.

"Libby has done a tremendous service, not just in helping me politically, and not just in so many of her governmental events, but also in what she has done to help candidates, to help our party -- the most recent one being all that she did to help and to attend events and to host events and to speak at the national convention -- and I'm proud of that," Mr. Pataki said at a brief news conference in Albany after speaking to the state's Conservative Party.

Mrs. Pataki wears a number of hats. As first lady, she travels the state and speaks about issues like domestic violence. The governor's office arranges her travel for her official duties, officials said. Mrs. Pataki is also the top earner in the Pataki household: She reported earning more than $300,000 in 2003 in consulting fees, including her work as a paid consultant to two charities. And over the last decade she has earned more than $650,000 as a consultant to Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir.

But party officials said that they had been moved to pay for an assistant to the first lady because of another role: as a builder of the Republican Party.

"Mrs. Pataki has been a great ambassador for the Republican Party," Stephen Minarik, the party's new chairman, said in a statement.
