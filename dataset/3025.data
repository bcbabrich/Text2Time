Tom Golisano, the billionaire whose campaign commercials seem to be on the air every other minute, scaled back his advertising in the New York metropolitan area yesterday and is instead concentrating his efforts upstate, his media adviser said yesterday.

The Associated Press reported that officials at several television stations said Mr. Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, had canceled heavy advertising scheduled to appear in the city Monday and Tuesday. The report also said he was canceling ads upstate, but his campaign officials said that was not the case. They did confirm that he was cutting back significantly in the city and its suburbs, however. His adviser, Erick Mullen, said that the campaign's polls showed that Mr. Golisano had met his targets in the city and its suburbs.

The news set off widespread speculation, the vigor of which could be interpreted as indicative of the general lack of suspense in the governor's race. Had Mr. Golisano decided to become frugal and stop investing his considerable personal wealth in his campaign commercials? Was he making new advertisements for the city? Or was he throwing in the towel after a new public poll showed him much further behind than his internal polls?

Some analysts believed that his move could help H. Carl McCall, the Democratic candidate who is trying to solidify support in the city.
