This small city's fate has always been tied to the land. Now Delano is pinning its hopes on what lies beneath the land.

Notable for grapes and once the home of César Chávez, the founder of the United Farm Workers union, Delano is in one of the richest agricultural areas in the United States. Yet the city has long struggled with high unemployment and deep poverty, particularly among its large Hispanic and immigrant population.

In recent years, city officials have relied on a prison and a fruit packing and distribution center to keep the economy afloat. But this spring the city's sights have turned back to the land, to a natural gas field that a local wildcatter speculates may be the second largest ever found in the West, after the giant Rio Vista field, also in California.

Though state officials and other experts express skepticism about the gas field, Delano officials sense opportunity in even the slim chance that the speculation will prove true. After all, natural gas is gold these days in a state that needs the fuel for plants generating electricity.
