3. Remove cooled ham from water. Preheat oven to 900 degrees. Cut off all rind except for a small band over the shank that will serve as a handle for carving. Trim off all fat, leaving only layer between a quarter- and a halfinch thick. If you like, score fat in a diamond pattern and stud with cloves in the traditional way, although this is not customary with a country ham.

4. Mix brown sugar with cornmeal, mustard and pepper, and moisten with bourbon or whichever juice you prefer. Spread over ham and bake for 20 minutes or until topping becomes bubbly and deep golden brown.

5. Watch ham carefully during glazbig. Add more glaze it necessary and a little water if sugar melts down and looks as though it will burn. Country ham is best served cold. It should be sliced very thinly with the grain.

Note: The excellent country ham we tested came from Kentucky and was salt‐cured. Hams now available from this same source are about 8 months old, though they can be 12 to 15 months old at other times. These hams show white mold specks within the meat when sliced, considered desirable by aficionados. If you like ham salty, do not soak it, or do so for only 12 hours. For novices the 29‐hour soak is preferable. Even with soaking, it will be salty. Sugarcured hams are also available from the same source. These are known as city hams, opposed to country hams, and have far less character. Sugar‐cured hams, which are not salty, are made with sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite. Salt‐cured hams contain neither. Country ham traditionalists use no glaze, and Donald Penn, who makes these hams, likes to boil his in water with Coca‐Cola. These Government‐inspected hams can be ordered from Penn's Old Country ‘Hams, Route 6, Campbellsville, Ky. 42718; (502) 965‐5065. They cost $1.89 per pound and range from 10 to 16 pounds. There is an additional charge for post age and a $1 charge for boxing. Expect hams c.o.d. one week from the time your order is received.

A first cousin to Louisiana gumbo, this thick soup‐stew may be made with file powder, although Mr. Patteson's was not. It is customary to begin with chicken, then add something that runs by—squirrel, possum or rabbit. Nothing ran by in Mr. Patteson's apartment, so he added ham for depth of flavor.
