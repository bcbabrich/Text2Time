To the Editor:

Neil Genzlinger's column of Nov. 24 perpetuates the myth that mazes can be mysterious and difficult to navigate.

Actually there is a way, which may not be the shortest way but will get you out. Simply touch either the left wall or the right wall as you enter and maintain continuous contact with it. I know of no way for a maze maker to defeat this strategy.
