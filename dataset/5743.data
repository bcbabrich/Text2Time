PATTI BOWN, who played in the Kool Jazz Festival's daily series of piano soloists at Carnegie Recital Hall on Tuesday, is a free spirit who is not bound by traditional ways of doing things.

Normally, musicians build their programs from an easy, casual or audience-settling beginning toward a dramatic conclusion.

Not Miss Bown. She sat down at the piano and launched into one of her own compositions, ''Pressing On,'' whose Gospel feeling was emphasized by the emphatic power of her heavy cords, and then moved on to ''Hop Scotch,'' an explosive, driving flow of lines that often became violently intertwined.

Even when she began to reminisce about her childhood in Seattle and the music she heard there, the power of her attack did not diminish. As an avid Saturday afternoon moviegoer, she heard Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy sing ''You Are Love,'' an aria-like song that Miss Bown played with strong, thick-textured phrases. Even when she sang a slow ballad of the 1940's, ''Walkin' by the River,'' which she remembered from Una Mae Carlisle's record, Miss Bown's piano overwhelmed her singing.
