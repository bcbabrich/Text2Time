Miceli: Nicolas Hidiroglou; Far Left Necklace: Sarah Anne Ward

It’s no surprise that Camille Miceli makes jewelry that is covetable and well designed. The daughter of a French stylist, Miceli began creating jewelry for Louis Vuitton back in 2004 and, since 2009, has been doing the same for Dior. Her superchic personal style has been touted by fashion heavyweights like her current boss, Raf Simons, as well as her former employer Marc Jacobs, who has called her his muse. Each piece in Miceli’s prefall collection for Dior has the ability to single-handedly pull an outfit together. These are objects that are both substantial and restrained — like the Diorama necklace, a breastplate-like collar of gold-finished metal adorned with a single, gleaming red glass stone.
