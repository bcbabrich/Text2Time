Talks on the country's political future could resume soon after the government and the two main rebel groups agreed yesterday to let political parties decide on their own representatives. The parties, which will influence the choice of the next president, are expected to draw up a new list of delegates over the weekend. The talks, scheduled to last 45 days, were suspended less than 24 hours after the opening ceremony on Monday because the rebel groups said the government had inserted stooges in the parties' delegations.
