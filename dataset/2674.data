"Chris was the core of this house -- everybody looked up to him," said Firefighter Mark Klinger, who had worked with Firefighter Engeldrum for the last five years.

"An excellent firefighter, a good father, a good friend," Firefighter Klinger added. "That's all I can say."

Firefighter Engeldrum had completed his service with the National Guard, but re-enlisted. He did so, his colleagues said, in outrage at the Sept. 11 attack. "It had an effect on him," said Lt. Brian Horton of Ladder Company 61. "His country was attacked, he was a soldier, and he wanted to defend it."

Firefighter Engeldrum is survived by his wife, Sharon, and his two sons: Sean, 18, and Royce, 16. Royce's birthday, fire officials said, was the day his father died.

The firefighter last spoke with his family the night before Thanksgiving.

"He was glad to hear my voice," Mrs. Engeldrum recalled. "He was tired. He couldn't talk. He was going out on a mission. He just called to see if everything was O.K. here."

At City Hall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised Firefighter Engeldrum for having served not only in the Fire Department, but also in the Police Department. "Christian Engeldrum spent his life protecting the people of this city and protecting democracy," the mayor said. "As a firefighter, a police officer and a decorated member of our military, there was no risk he wasn't willing to take for his fellow New Yorkers and his fellow Americans."

Thirty city firefighters are on active duty overseas. Since Sept. 11, 2001, 103 have been called to active duty.
