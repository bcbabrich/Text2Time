Joseph Modugno, Republican Councilman at Large from Queens, visited City HaIl yesterday and inspected the basement office he is to use for the next two years.

The new Councilman, in a letter to Council President Paul R. Screvane had criticized the office as “cell‐like” and had protested its proximity to the ladies’ room. Mr. Screvane replied orally that Mr. Modugno should devote more time to his constituents’ needs and less time to his own “creature comforts.”

Mr. Modugno explained yesterday that he was as much concerned about the lack of secretarial assistance for councilmen as he was about the location of the office. Mr. Screvane should realize, he said, that the constituents’ needs would be better served when the councilmen had enough staff aid to perform their duties properly.

The room outfitted for the five new Republican Councilmen at Large is long and narrow, and their desks are in a row. There is one window at the rear.
