When Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives Sunday in this Communist outpost in the Caribbean, he may find that his warmest welcome comes not from his official hosts but from Cuban dissidents who now look to Moscow as an improbable beacon of freedom.

On the eve of the Soviet leader's three-day visit, an alliance of human rights groups has appealed to Mr. Gorbachev to champion their grievances against the Government of Fidel Castro, and a dissident held a highly unusual news conference to call for political change and an end to Cuban military adventurism.

Cuban dissidents got some tacit encouragement today when an advance team of senior Soviet officials used their first news conference to showcase the Soviet Union's recent experiment with competitive elections.

Speaking to Cuban and foreign reporters, Nikolai I. Yefimov, the deputy head of the Communist Party's Ideology Department, hailed democratic elections as a critical new article in Mr. Gorbachev's political gospel.
