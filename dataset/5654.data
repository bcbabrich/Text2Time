BELLINI'S ''Puritani'' ideally calls for four major vocal personalities - technically and artistically on the highest level, musically creative and impassioned - in the four principal parts. Joan Sutherland has been showing that it can get by on one, even when the one is in the autumn of her career, in recent weeks at the Metropolitan. Saturday afternoon her ''cover,'' Francoise Garner, made her regularly scheduled appearance in the soprano part, and, though she carried through creditably enough in her own terms, the opera does not work this way.

Miss Garner has a secure voice, and though it is not of outstanding size or quality, one never feared misfortune or worried about her ability to sustain the part. She could do herself a great favor by serious work on florid singing; her execution was only occasionally accurate and clear. She went through the staging with confidence but not with command. Perhaps in a less virtuosic role she might make a better impression; one cannot help questioning the wisdom (Miss Garner's or the Met's) of scheduling appearances for the cover singers in cases like this.

Salvatore Fisichella repeated his brightly Italianate but routinely sung Arturo, Sherrill Milnes his distressingly effortful Riccardo and Samuel Ramey his vocally sound but musically and dramatically lackluster Giorgio.
