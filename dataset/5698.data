New Zealand's Prime Minister said today that the United States wants to drive him from office because of his antinuclear policy and is using tactics ''akin to the very totalitarianism we're supposed to be fighting against.''

The Prime Minister, David Lange, whose Labor Government has been in office seven months, was reacting at a news conference to what he called a ''whole range of countermeasures'' by the United States, ''including a failure to exercise in land, sea and air and a cutoff in intelligence sources.''

WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (AP) - The State Department has told New Zealand there will be no cutoff in sales of American military equipment, New Zealand's Ambassador, Wallace Rowling, said today.
