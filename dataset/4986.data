MY barbecues this summer have featured much more pork than beef. Pork is a tender and mild meat that can be enhanced by all sorts of marinades.

It demands careful cooking, however. The harmful parasites that may exist call for cooking the meat to an internal temperature of 180 degrees. If you do not have a meat thermometer, you can check by piercing the meat. The juices should run clear.

In this recipe, boneless pork medallions, trimmed of fat, are marinated in olive oil, lemon juice, white wine, mustard, garlic, cumin, rosemary, sage, salt and pepper. The meat is cooked on the grill for about 15 minutes, turning occasionally.

I like to heat the marinade and bind it with a little butter. The cooked meat is then placed in this before serving, becoming more tender.
