To the Editor: Apropos of ''A Free Museum Is Harder to Find'' (Dec. 28), my wife and I have known that United States citizens are not eligible for Italy's free entry for over-65's since we first encountered the policy in 1988. However, we have occasionally gotten the reduction, mostly by keeping our mouths shut, or sometimes by muttering ''vecchio'' (''aged''), or ''I speak English'' (British subjects get the discount).

On reading Betsy Wade's article, I thought immediately of the time we visited the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. The young woman behind the desk could see us coming and I could see her reach for a pad of ''old folks'' tickets and get ready to stamp them before we reached the desk. She stamped one and had her hand raised to stamp the second when my wife said (in rather too-loud Brooklyn English), ''How did she know we're old?'' The hand paused, a scowl appeared, a combination sigh-hiss emerged and the stamp banged down on the second pass. We rapidly fled to the interior.

Actually, as noted in the article, the free-entry rule applies only to Italian state museums. Others set their own rules. Probably the strangest was at the Museo Barracco di Scultura Antica in Rome. There, we had to show our passports, sign affidavits and write an entry in a log book before being granted free admission as senior citizens.
