Last Updated, Saturday, 12:37 p.m. Bad news, readers. New images appear to cast doubt on the accuracy of two of the week’s most widely reported stories: the rumored pregnancy of Syria’s first lady, and the pioneering spaceflight of an Iranian monkey.

As a Washington Post correspondent, Liz Sly, reported, the office of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria posted five new photographs of his wife, Asma, on Facebook as part of an effort to disprove a curious aside in a Lebanese newspaper report that she is pregnant. Each of the photographs, said to have been taken last week in Damascus, shows a very slender Mrs. Assad congratulating the winners of this year’s Syrian Science Olympiad.

As my colleague Rick Gladstone explained, “rumors that Mrs. Assad had conceived in June” were first reported in November by Al Bawaba, an Amman-based news Web site. Since the British-born first lady has been out of public view for most of the past year, as her husband’s government has struggled to regain control of the country, the rumors spread despite an absence of visual confirmation.

The photographs were released a day after Mr. Assad’s office issued an indignant statement taking exception to a Washington Post blogger’s reading of the Lebanese newspaper’s story. The statement said the blogger, Max Fisher, “based his analysis on false allegations that led him to wrong results which are far from reality.”

Since Syria’s Science Olympiad takes place every year, the president’s office could have recycled images taken a year or more earlier, but that would require the cooperation of all of the students pictured with Mrs. Assad. At least one of the students in the new photographs, a girl with curly hair wearing brightly patterned sneakers, does appear in another image of the winners posted on the Olympiad’s Facebook page.

While this set of images appears to back the official story coming out of Syria, recently released photographs and video of the monkey that Iran says it sent into space seem to undermine that nation’s claims.

As journalists at the German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle pointed out on its Persian language site on Thursday, the first reports on the space mission published in Iran’s state-run media showed an anxious-looking monkey prepared for blast-off with a prominent mole above its right eye.

When Iran got around to releasing photographs and video of the monkey’s capsule being retrieved post-flight, there was no trace of a mole in close-ups of the monkey waving to reporters or smiling at a subsequent public appearance.

That led to speculation that Iran might have tried to cover up a failed space mission by displaying a different monkey from the one that made a 150-mile round trip into the thermosphere. Or that the newly famous monkey had fallen prey to the Iranian penchant for cosmetic surgery.

The missing mole is not exactly hard evidence that Iranians had a spare monkey waiting in the wings to pretend that it had just gotten back from space. Iran does have a track record of fictionalizing its achievements in rocket science, but in July, the Iranian Students’ News Agency — which released photographs of the monkey with and without the mole this week — reported that the space agency in Tehran had five monkeys in training for the mission.
