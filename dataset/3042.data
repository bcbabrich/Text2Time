Yesterday's playoff game against Denver was supposed to be the ultimate test for the Ravens' vaunted defense. In the first three weeks of the season, the Broncos scored 111 points for the best three-week output in franchise history. For the season, the Broncos averaged 30.3 points, second in the National Football League to the Rams.

Yesterday the Broncos, playing without their starting quarterback, Brian Griese, were held to 3 points -- a 31-yard field goal in the second quarter.

Billick was asked if this game elevated the Baltimore defense. His response underscored the irritation among the Ravens over a widespread perception that the defense, despite its gaudy statistics (four shutouts, only 165 points allowed), is overrated.

''The only place it's going to elevate it is with you all,'' Billick said, referring to the news media. ''A lot of you all didn't believe. You were discrediting what we did because of a certain number of opponents we played or the style of play and the fact that a lot of yards were put up. Whatever. It doesn't elevate this group. The way people may look at us, it may change a little bit.''

Mike Anderson, the top candidate for N.F.L. rookie of the year, is a believer.

Long after yesterday's game was over, Anderson, the Broncos' hard-running running back, sat in front of his locker, going through the agonizing, postloss routine. He put away a thick playbook, packed his bags for the last time. Anderson came into this playoff game with all kinds of impressive numbers. He had rushed for 1,500 yards, and was first among N.F.L. rookies in touchdowns scored. He rushed for 251 yards against the Saints, the most yardage in a single game by a rookie. In his 12 starts, Anderson averaged an N.F.L.-best 122.6 yards.
