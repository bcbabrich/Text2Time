William A. Ackman has had his ups and downs as the manager of the $12 billion asset hedge fund Pershing Square Capital. He specializes in making big, concentrated bets and backing them up with bold – often very public – pronouncements about his investment theses.

Sometimes his investments score big, such as with his stake in Burger King in 2014, when the fast-food restaurant unveiled plans to merge with the doughnut-and-coffee chain Tim Hortons and move its corporate headquarters to Canada, which has lower taxes; and a stake in the mall operator General Growth Properties.

But sometimes his investments disappoint, as in the cases of Herbalife and Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Canadian Pacific Railway. (In early August, Pershing sold all of its holdings in the railway company.)

As of June, Mr. Ackman had 12 stocks in his portfolio, which was down 21 percent this year. Here is a look at how some of his ideas have fared.
