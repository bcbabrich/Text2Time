Re "C.I.A Report Says Chinese Sent Iran Arms Components; Pakistan Also Got Parts" (front page, June 22):

We categorically reject the baseless allegations that Pakistan received M-11 missiles or their components from China.

The Government of Pakistan has consistently maintained that Pakistan has not acquired M-11 or any other missiles from China that violate the Missile Technology Control Regime.

Pakistan has advocated the creation of a zero-missile zone in South Asia and supports the American efforts to avoid a missile race in the region. SYED RIFAAT HUSSAIN Minister of Information Embassy of Pakistan Washington, June 23, 1995
