To the Editor:

Your Sept 9 editorial about Mayor Koch's recently announced Police Cadet Corps program expressed regret that the program is not as bold and ambitious as the Police Corps concept promoted by Adam Walinsky.

The Walinsky proposal has serious defects:

It has a formidable fiscal defect -a staggering price tag of almost one billion dollars - and a daunting political defect - after years of promotion, not one official in the state government has publicly expressed support for the idea, which is fatal since by definition it must be created by state and not municipal authority.

The proposal's professional defects are dramatic and severe.

* Since budgetary support emanates exclusively from the state, and the corpsmen-cops are formally part of the state police, the centuries-old principle of municipal control of policing is severely eroded.

* The creation of non-careerist, short-term contract debtors attached to the New York City Police Department, in numbers ultimately contemplated to make up more than half the force, is a decisive step away from the professional principle of careerism in policing, which is indispensable to the maintenance, through pension and promotion expectations, of high professional standards.
