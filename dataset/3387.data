The effects might differ by air bag design, Dr. Segui-Gomez said, but since manufacturers keep the details of their designs secret, she could not analyze that. She wrote the study while she was a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health; she has since moved to the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

The study found that for all drivers wearing belts, air bags reduced fatalities by about 19 percent.

The second study, at Harvard, analyzed the difference in air bag risk to children under 13 based on the child's age, and found that their experience differed, too.

For the whole group of 16,200 children, a child seated in the front seat who was wearing a belt was 31 percent more likely to be killed if the car had an air bag. If the child was not wearing a belt, the risk of death was 84 percent higher if the car had an air bag.

But among the older children -- those aged 9 to 12 -- if they wore a seat belt, the presence of an air bag reduced their chance of death by 39 percent. The chance of death was roughly the same in the front and back seats, assuming that seat belts were used.

The finding is not good news for engineers trying to develop ''smart'' air bags that would determine the size and weight of a front-seat passenger and use that information to determine how fast to inflate the air bag, or whether to deploy it at all. ''It may be difficult to design systems that can accurately distinguish children who would benefit from air bag deployment from those who wouldn't be harmed,'' said the study's lead author, John D. Graham.

In response to a rash of child casualties from air bags, the companies that make the bags, along with car manufacturers, insurers and the federal government, began a campaign to urge parents to put children 12 and under in the back seat, buckle them up or put them in an age-appropriate safety seat. At the National Safety Council, one of the sponsoring organizations, a spokesman, Chuck Hurley, said the campaign would stick with the idea that children 12 and under should sit in the back.
