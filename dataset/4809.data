The new rulers of Ethiopia are convening a conference in Addis Ababa on Monday to form a more broadly based provisional government -- a step viewed as vital to healing the ethnically divided, financially strapped country after years of civil war and famine.

But the meeting of Ethiopian factions, including the three rebel fronts that worked together to overthrow the Soviet-backed regime of the past 14 years, is expected to put off for the time being an issue critical to the country's long-term unity. That is the question of whether the province of Eritrea in the north of the country should become independent, an outcome favored by the rebel organization now in control there.

The meeting is taking place largely at the urging of the United States, the main foreign mediator in the Ethiopian conflict. Washington won a pledge that such a conference would be held from the front led by rebels from Tigre Province. In return, Washington gave political support to that group's takeover of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, last month. Possibility of Economic Help

A senior American diplomat said that if the Tigrean-led front can form an ethnically diverse government, then Western governments and the World Bank may show more interest in economic support for Ethiopia. Under the Marxist-Leninist rule of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, Washington gave large amounts of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, but because of the Mengistu Government's poor human rights record there was no economic assistance.
