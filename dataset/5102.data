The opportunity came for Tucker on Saturday afternoon with 11 seconds left. It was only the ninth 3-pointer in his last 49 attempts for the man Al Bianchi, the team's general manager, calls ''our pinch-hitter.''

''When our offense needs a boost,'' Bianchi said, ''and it seems like there is a lid on our basket, it's time for Trent to come in and take it off.''

It hasn't always been that way for Tucker in his seven Knick reasons. He can remember Hubie Brown's coaching days, when calls of ''power right'' and ''power left'' rang out from the bench and he was left out of the offense. Pitino has changed all that. He introduced a running game and incorporated the 3-point shot into the offense.

''Rick is always aware where his 3-point shooters are,'' said Tucker, who is among the league leaders from 3-point range. ''He's got a very loud voice and it carries all over the court even when the Garden is filled.

''There was a time the 3-point basket was looked upon as a desperation shot. Rick changed that. Properly executed the way we did it Saturday, it can be a thing of beauty. When I'm shooting them well, the basket looks like one big ocean to me.''

But before Tucker found a coach who would believe in his long-range shooting, he had to change his way of life, especially during the off season.

''When you're young,'' said the 29-year-old Tucker, ''you don't always watch what you eat and you don't stay in shape. You let your youth take care of that. But when Rick came in and talked about playing a much faster game, you have to take care of your body to play that style of basketball. It called for a lot more running and drills. I wanted to be part of it, so I worked hard.''

It took Tucker only 45 games to break the club record of 69 3-pointers he set last year. This season, he finished with 118. Tucker, who will be an unrestricted free agent after the season, would like nothing better than to ''finish my career with the Knicks.''
