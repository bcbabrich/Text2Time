It was the usual ritual, only this time it was in Wakefield, Mass., a suburb of Boston. Relatives, friends and co-workers spent the holiday weekend carrying their grief through the bitter cold to pay their final respects to the seven men and women blasted into eternity by yet another deranged gunman.

In the spring of 1999, when two students went on a murder rampage at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., some students inside the school used their cell phones to provide reporters with updates on the atrocity as it was happening. The kids understood the drill. We all do. There is very little in American culture that is more familiar than gun violence.

Fifteen people died at Columbine, including the two shooters, who turned their weapons on themselves. Five months after those shootings, a man with a semiautomatic handgun opened fire on congregants praying in a Baptist Church in Fort Worth. Eight people died, including the gunman, who shot himself.

In March 1998, two boys armed with high-powered rifles killed a teacher and four little girls at a school in Jonesboro, Ark. In July 1999, a dozen people were killed in Atlanta by a frustrated investor armed with a variety of guns. He also killed himself. Last Thursday night in Philadelphia, seven people were murdered by masked gunmen who burst into a rundown crack house and opened fire.
