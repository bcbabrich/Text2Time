WRISTON--Kathryn Dineen. Syracuse University and its Board of Trustees mourn the loss of its dear friend and benefactor. Kathy was a remarkably accomplished attorney, businesswoman and philanthropist. An honorary member of Syracuse University's College of Law Board of Advisors, she, along with her brother, Bob, a university trustee, and sister, Carolyn were instrumental in the realization of the College's new home, Dineen Hall. It was named in honor of their parents, Robert Emmet Dineen and Carolyn Bareham Dineen. Our heartfelt condolences to their entire family.
