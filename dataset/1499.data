Ahead of Warren E. Buffett‘s Q.&A. with shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual meeting in Omaha, the biggest question on many people’s minds was: how does the billionaire investor feel about Goldman Sachs?

After all, Goldman has been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for Securities Fraud. And the Justice Department has begun a preliminary inquiry of its own. Since the S.E.C. filed suit against Goldman two weeks ago, the firm has lost $21 billion in market value.

But in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Mr. Buffett — who has $5 billion invested in Goldman — said he backed the firm’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, “100 percent.”

Here’s more from Bloomberg:

“He’s done a great job running that firm,” Buffett said today in Omaha, Nebraska in a Bloomberg Television interview before the shareholders meeting for his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “He’s smart. He’s high grade.” Buffett became one of Goldman Sachs’s most visible advocates amid public outrage over the bank’s pay practices and conduct with customers. He backed Blankfein in January, saying the bank’s leader since 2006 “has been the right man” for the job. Last month, Goldman Sachs was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and Blankfein, 55, was pilloried in Congress on April 27. The SEC said Goldman Sachs misled clients on the sale of assets tied to home loans as the housing market started to falter. The bank, which said the suit is unfounded, must weigh the risks of a legal battle against the benefits of a more immediate resolution as politicians vilify the firm as a symbol of the Wall Street excess that led to the collapse of the residential real estate market. Buffett said he will discuss the trade at the center of the regulator’s suit later today at the meeting and “I will bet that of the 40,000 people in there, 39,900 of them have a misconception.”
