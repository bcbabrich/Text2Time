Percussion by David Moss

David Moss, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, Manhattan, (212) 219-3055. David Moss's percussion and voice supply outbursts of anarchy. On an extended drum kit that includes crumped cymbals and rattling sheet metal, he can sock a steady beat or the sound of a junkyard during an earthquake; he sings and babbles in invented languages that move from the operatic to the anarchic. At 9 P.M. on Sunday he leads his Dense Band (with guitar, bass and cello), which puts a quasi-funk bottom behind the noise; at 11 P.M., he will play duets with five other musicians. Tickets are $8 in advance, $10 at the door, including one drink. Sounds of South Africa

Mahlathini, the Mahotella Queens and the Maghona Tsohle band, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824. What the Motown hit factory was to mid-1960's America, Mahlathini, the Mahotella Queens and the Maghona Tsohle band were to South Africa. Mahlathini, a self-described "groaner," has a bottomless bass voice with an unmistakable sense of humor; the Mahotella Queens sass him in sweet three-part harmony, and Maghona Tsohle is the sure-footed rhythm section that perfected the rolling bounce of mbaqanga. Tonight at 8; tickets are $20 and $25. Kenny Neal Doubles Up

Kenny Neal, Tramps, 45 West 21st Street, Manhattan, (212) 727-7788. While "Mule Bone" is at the Barrymore Theater, one of its stars, the bluesman Kenny Neal, has a regular Friday-night engagement at Tramps, with a band that includes a three-man horn section. Mr. Neal has a hearty voice that turns into a growl as he laments woman troubles; his guitar solos are terse, pointed and memorable. Peach Fish Pie opens tonight's shows at 9 and midnight; admission is $10. The Week's Rock Album

360's: "Illuminated" (Link/Hollywood/Elektra): If the Pretenders had been more attached to punk-rock's concision and the impact of loud, layered guitars, they would have sounded like the 360's, a band from Boston. The thick, assertive, post-psychedelic guitars arrive by way of the Byrds, the late Beatles and newer bands like My Bloody Valentine and Lush, while Audrey Clark's singing updates the jaded assurance of the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde. As the band's lyrics veer between depression and defiance, the guitars don't allow an instant of doubt.
