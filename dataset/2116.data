New York will join four other states — New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, and Washington — in suing the federal government over the Bush administration’s decision to restrict states from expanding coverage through the federal State Children’s Health Insurance Program, Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced this afternoon.



In August, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new rules that would make it much harder, if not impossible, for about 19 states to extend coverage to children in middle-income families. Under the new rules, states seeking waivers for a higher income ceiling would have to show that they have already enrolled 95 percent of children whose parents make less than twice the poverty level. Currently, no state in the country meets that standard.

Mr. Spitzer, who has made expanding coverage to more children a priority of his administration, said the new federal rules violated laws that give governors broad discretion in setting the income eligibility levels in their states. In late August, he raised the prospect of a legal challenge.

New York has sought to expand its program to cover children in families with incomes up to four times as much as the federal poverty level, or $82,600 for a family of four. The state’s current limit is 250 percent of the poverty level. Last month, the Bush administration rejected the proposed expansion, which would have covered 70,000 uninsured youngsters. The decision was the first time that the new rules had been applied.

The lawsuit will argue that the new rules conflict with the statute setting up the federal program and were issued without an opportunity for public comment. as required by law.

In addition to the five states taking part in the lawsuit, Arizona, California and New Hampshire will submit supporting briefs, New York State officials said.
