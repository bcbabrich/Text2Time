Hilly Kristal, founder and owner of the seminal East Village punk club CBGB, called the policy unfortunate. "I would take each request separately," he said. "The music itself does not stir up anything terrible, and a lot of these kids who come to see it and listen to it are fine. There can be 500 people, and maybe 10 or 15 who cause the trouble." Verifying Names

Although the city has many restrictions on large events held in public spaces, especially Central Park, until yesterday the Parks Department had dealt loosely with smaller events.

It has not required photo identification cards so that the city could verify the name and address of a permit seeker.

The city has always made concert promoters post bonds, on average, of $250 for cleanup. If the organizers failed to restore parks to their original state, they forfeited the money. But the $250 was low compared to the real cost, Mr. Stern said.

Under the changes, he said, the city will have greater flexibility in imposing higher cleanup bonds -- as high as $5,000 -- on high-risk concerts and locations. "If there's a history of violence or failure to clean up, the bond will go up," he said.

John Miller, deputy commissioner of public information for the police, said the department does not keep statistics on the violence rates of one group of music fan versus another. "We can't characterize one form of art as causing more aggression than another -- albeit we haven't seen Mozart fans looting on the streets."

Parks officials said Summerfest had a permit to showcase local heavy metal, rap and punk rock bands, from 2 to 6 P.M. Because of technical difficulties, said Susan Alexander, an organizer, the concert began late and, with the agreement of the police, ended at 6:17 P.M. The authorities do not dispute this point, but disagree on what ensued.
