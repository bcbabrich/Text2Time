This blog is on hiatus. From May 2006 to June 2007, it covered government and politics in the New York region, supplementing our regular news coverage. The metropolitan staff now blogs about politics and other topics at the City Room blog. Please update your blogrolls, links and feeds, and join us there. Thanks.
