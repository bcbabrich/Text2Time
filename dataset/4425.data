Somewhere out there is the perfect Charlie Goldberg. He's a boy who's 13 years old, give or take a year or two, with a sharp sense of humor and a savvy New York demeanor laced with sensitivity. MEG SIMON , a casting director, is scouring the city for him to take over the role as one of the two sons in "Conversations With My Father," the drama about a Jewish bartender on the Lower East Side struggling for assimilation and success.

Since the play's opening in March, the part has been played by two boys, DAVID KRUMHOLTZ , who had never acted professionally and was found in an open casting call, and JASON WOLINER , a professional actor.

With Jason departing in March for other pursuits, Ms. Simon and her associates have been reconsidering all the boys they saw in their previous searches.

"First we looked at all the professional children, but we know all those kids," she said the other day. "None fit that were both interested and available. So we have started to call schools, coaches, acting teachers, friends, our dentist, asking if they know anyone we can see."
