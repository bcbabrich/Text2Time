Bob Woolf, the pioneering Boston-based sports lawyer who used what he called friendly persuasion to negotiate headline contracts for some of the nation's most famous athletes and entertainers, died on Monday night at a home he maintained in Hallandale, Fla. He was 65.

"He was watching 'Monday Night Football' and he just didn't wake up," his daughter Stacey Woolf-Feinberg said yesterday. "He was in the peak of health and had been playing tons of tennis." She said an autopsy would determine the cause of death.

Partly because he was one of the first sports agents, and partly because he brought to the profession both skill and a special sense of ethical responsibility, Mr. Woolf was one of the best known of his breed. Long List of Clients

If he never became quite as famous as the athletes and entertainers he represented, it was only because his client list tended to read like a catalogue of household names, among them Carl Yastrzemski, Larry Bird, Doug Flutie, Bernard King, John Havlicek, Ken Harrelson, Jim Plunkett, Julius Erving, Thurman Munson, Mark Fidrych, Jim Craig, Derek Sanderson, Robert Parish, Rocket Ismail, Ruben Sierra, Larry King and the New Kids on the Block.
