Instead companies with exposure to Asia and Russia -- like financial institutions -- or those that are heavily dependent on exports for earnings, are perceived to be at the most risk in the near future and a risky partner for a potential merger.

In addition, merger activity among high-technology companies could fall off sharply as a direct result of the market decline. Internet stock prices, in particular, were in a free fall yesterday, making it difficult for bankers and executives alike to figure out what price an acquired company should command.

''There has been a chilling effect,'' said Gene Sykes, co-head of the high-technology group at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''Some deals won't get done for two weeks, maybe a month. No one really knows.''

But while Wall Street watchers are cautious about the future, there is little concern that deals already struck this year will unravel. A market downturn itself is not enough to halt a transaction, especially in stock-for-stock deals where the prices of both company's stock have fallen in tandem.

The real deal-killers will be companies that either miss earnings or run into trouble abroad.

Still, the market has been rife the last two weeks with rumors about what deal will be the next to be scrapped or renegotiated, like the recent renegotiation of the merger between Tellabs and Ciena. Early last week, for instance, rumors cropped up that the Travelers Group and Citicorp merger was being renegotiated, something company executives said was untrue.
