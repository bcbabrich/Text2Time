To the Editor:

''Inevitable Surgery on Medicare'' (editorial, June 26) holds that Medicare will be rescued by changing the eligibility age and increasing contributions by the wealthy. Absolutely, but not according to plans crafted by the Senate.

Medicare's eligibility age should be lowered to 0, at once solving the problem of the uninsured and ending profiteering in the health sector. And yes, the wealthy should pay more -- not at the point of service or premium, but through a more equitable income tax system. Medicare's popularity calls for its extension, not its disappearance.
