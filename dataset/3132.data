Last year, Wet Naps were upgraded into fancy wipes. This summer, drugstore hand sanitizers like Purell have trickled up to department store beauty counters in the form of ''cleansing waters.'' Reaching beyond scented mists, these new ablutionary agents are meant to be used for makeup removal and face-cleaning without water. This month, Make Up For Ever introduced Eau Demaquillante -- a pump bottle of clear fluid with a slight scent ($25 at Henri Bendel); Sephora brought out its own light-blue Cleansing Water with moisturizing agents ($7.50).

L'Occitane's entry has a citrusy scent ($15 at Barneys New York). Santa Maria Novella's Purifying Fluid is the most Purell-like of all -- thick, with a gel texture and the promise of germ-killing properties ($30 at eLuxury.com). While all the cleansing waters remove grime and cosmetics, they also leave your face pining, ever so slightly, for a good follow-up rinse with plain old H2O.
