Six former owners and employees of two Manhattan after-hours clubs were indicted yesterday on charges that they evaded liquor and tax laws and then conspired to impede investigations of those crimes.

Attorney General Robert Abrams, in announcing the indictments, said the six men had operated the clubs ''with a complete disregard for the liquor and tax laws'' and that they ''conspired to bribe and coerce witnesses in order to frustrate our investigation.''

Three of the men - who prosecutors said were principals of the clubs, the Mine Shaft and Hell Fire - already face charges under an indictment in December stating that they tried to bribe a witness to leave the state so that he could not testify in the investigation. Yesterday's indictment included those earlier allegations.

Both the Mine Shaft, a club at 835 Washington Street that chiefly catered to homosexuals, and Hell Fire, a mainly heterosexual club at 26 Ninth Avenue, near West 13th Street, have been closed since last fall. The Mine Shaft was closed by the city in November under the so-called ''safe sex'' regulations that were issued last year to curb the spread of AIDS. Hell Fire closed voluntarily shortly afterward.
