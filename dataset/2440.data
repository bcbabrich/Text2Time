The staircase was a silver helix spiraling up from the earth to balance the first story and continuing on to evoke a phantom upper floor. It was a structure at once complex and crystal clear, refined and vernacular, and thus mirrored the piece it was made to serve. Created by the installation artist Judy Pfaff, it was the focus of her set for the production of Marc Blitzstein's opera "Regina" that opened Friday night at the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College as part of the Summerscape festival.

In fact the staircase said it all: this "Regina" was spare, elegant and classy. Which is no small feat, because "Regina" is hardly a streamlined opera: there's lots of plot and lots of text (here delivered largely comprehensibly, without supertitles, to the credit of the generally respectable cast). It's based on Lillian Hellman's play "The Little Foxes" (known to many through the film with Bette Davis), and Blitzstein sought to fuse various strains of the American vernacular in a conglomerate score that's studded with set pieces, now lush, now bristling, now tinged with jazz and complete with singing and dancing African-Americans.

These minstrel-show elements date the work, which had its first performance in 1949; what the composer intended as a gesture of emancipation now reads as rather the opposite. Still, the production showed why they should be included, uncomfortable though they be, in part because of the exuberant music and in part because of the composer's sense of dramatic pacing (which this complete version showed to have been quite sound). The fake Southern accents were possibly de trop; but given that the director, Peter Schneider, who used to be president of animation and chairman of the studio at the Walt Disney company, had never directed an opera before, the whole thing came off rather well.

It doesn't hurt to have a Regina of the caliber of Lauren Flanigan: a dramatic singer and actress whose portrayal here seemed veritably subdued in comparison to some of her work. That is, she was consummately successful in portraying a turn-of-the-century Southern lady whose alarmingly strong will is fettered by a veneer of good breeding. Having her finish an argument with her husband, and the second act, with the last word in the form of a high note was one of Blitzstein's better ideas, and Ms. Flanigan had the note -- a little subdued, but solid -- to pull it off.
