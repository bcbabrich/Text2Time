The British at home greeted the loss of their last major colony today with relative indifference, finding stronger reason for national pride in the current success of their tennis players at Wimbledon and rugby team in South Africa than for nostalgia over their imperial past.

What marking of the event there was involved people with direct ties to Hong Kong -- residents of the Chinatowns of cities like London and Birmingham, and brokers and businessmen whose livelihood depends on good relations with the new rulers of Asia's leading financial center.

''We are celebrating an opportunity, not holding a wake,'' said James Buchanan-Jardine, a stockbroker with N. C. L. Investments and the son of the late Sir John Buchanan-Jardine, the last family owner of the giant Hong Kong trading company Jardine Matheson.

He was heading out to a gathering of 2,500 members and guests of the Hong Kong Society at Sandown Park, a racecourse south of London where the annual Hong Kong Day Derby is held. The most recent Foreign Office stock market valuation of the more than 1,000 British companies operating in the colony exceeded $115 billion, and Mr. Buchanan-Jardine said British entrepreneurs and brokers were keenly interested in increasing business with China through its new Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, which supplies nearly 60 percent of all external investment in China.
