Greg LeMond, the new world professional road racing champion and the two-time Tour de France winner, has agreed to a three-year, $5.7 million contract with a combined French team.

An international bidding war started by his dramatic victory in the Tour de France last month has elevated LeMond, who will be paid $1.8 million in 1990, to the same tax bracket as America's highest-paid baseball, football and basketball players.(AP)
