In the 1950's the passion for finding important moral lessons buried in ''Lolita'' was fed by the moral attacks against the book. The book was turned down by four American publishers before Olympia Press, a French press best known for its smut, published ''Lolita'' in 1955. Shortly thereafter, the book was banned in France. Finally, in 1958, an American publisher, G. P. Putnam's Sons, picked it up.

The most recent wave of moral defense was sparked, yet again, by moral outrage against ''Lolita.'' In 1997, while Adrian Lyne, the director of the new movie version of ''Lolita,'' searched for an American distributor, Norman Podhoretz wrote in Commentary that ''Lolita'' bore ''some share of the blame for the plague of pedophilia.'' Now, after much waiting and a brand new layer of moral justifications, the new ''Lolita'' will be shown on Showtime tomorrow night and released in theaters in September. Here are the lessons of ''Lolita'' in their 1950's and 1990's versions.

Lolita is a cautionary tale.

Professor Ray said ''Lolita'' carried a warning: ''The wayward child, the egotistic mother, the panting maniac -- these are not only vivid characters in a unique story; they warn us of dangerous trends; they point out potent evils. Lolita should make all of us -- parents, social workers, educators -- apply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world.''

Last year the philosopher Colin McGinn made a similar argument in an essay titled ''The Moral Case for 'Lolita,' '' in The Times Literary Supplement: ''This is not a prettification or celebration or endorsement of Humbert's actions. . . . It is an open expression of misery, remorse, guilt and regret. . . . The book sees right into the heart of Humbert's deceptiveness, brutality and depravity; in no sense does it seek to excuse or mitigate them. . . . We are never for a moment encouraged to approve of his actions.

All men are Humberts.

This logic was first given by Humbert himself, when he says he is not the first man to fall in love with a child: ''After all, Dante fell madly in love with his Beatrice when she was 9, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely. . . . And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of 12 running in the wind, in the pollen and dust.''
