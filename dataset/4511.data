A man convicted of trying to kill a police officer escaped from the maximum security prison here Monday night and remained at large today.

Another man who escaped at the same time was captured a few hours later in the nearby woods.

The incident is the latest problem for the prison, the Ward A. Garner Correctional Institution, which was the site of a disturbance in April, and last week had three incidents in which guards or inmates were injured. Over the weekend, two female prisoners walked away from a minimum-security substance-abuse center.

The incidents have confirmed the fears of residents living near the prison, which opened in November after a failed effort by residents to stop it. "I haven't had too much sleep," said John Stokes, whose Mile Hill Road home abuts the prison. "My wife was informed by the state troopers to lock the doors and windows. I felt like I was in prison with the hot and humid weather while the inmates sat in their air-conditioned cells."

Another neighbor, Sue Seman, said, "I'm not panic-stricken, but I don't like it."

Bob Beres, who also lives near the prison, said he and his wife moved to the small town of 20,000 to "get away from the hustle and bustle of life." After the prison opened, he installed a security system at his house. "It's like being held captive in your own town," he said. Prison Is Near Capacity
