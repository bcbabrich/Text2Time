MONDAY PUZZLE — And so, the holiday season has officially ended for another year. Time to get back to work, right? Maybe it’s O.K. to ease into it.

Today’s Theme

Of course, we all don’t float from soiree to soiree through this part of winter — I confess to usually losing the fight against hibernation — but Jan. 2 notoriously hits with a thud, this year on a Monday, no less. Although that meant the solve was pretty quick, there was a clever and well-timed little theme that made it satisfying.

If you knew any of the four longest down clues, you filled in four bubbles in each that spelled some sort of jubilation. The dead-center down clue, 21D — “Really revel …” — reiterated and corresponded to the theme phrase, which was its answer.

I was inspired to hunt for the origin of the theme phrase, PARTY DOWN, and got nothing earlier than 1970s references, starting with a 1974 summer soul song by Little Beaver. Maybe someone has more scholarly information for the comments; there’s no doubt that there’s a funkiness to the expression but funk has existed in other forms throughout history, hasn’t it?
