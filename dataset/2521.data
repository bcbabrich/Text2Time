The last year has seen an explosion of pay music-downloading services. Some have been successes, like Apple's iTunes Music Store, with 1.5 million downloads a week. Others, like BuyMusic, are plagued by complaints from users. But there is another site that has iTunes Music Store and BuyMusic beat: Easy Music Download, which has a greater profit margin than iTunes Music Store and probably a greater percentage of dissatisfied users than BuyMusic.

On its Web site, Easy Music Download offers unlimited downloads from a catalog of more than 700,000 songs for an annual fee of $21.95. Theoretically, one could own tens of thousands of songs for the same price as just 22 tracks from the iTunes store. If it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is.

''When everything hit the fan about people being charged for illegal music found on their machines, that was just the get-up-and-go I needed to fork out the cash for the files I wanted,'' Angela Tennant, a 25-year-old student from South Carolina who subscribed to Easy Music Download, said in an interview conducted via e-mail. ''I just ended up paying up to the wrong people, and now I'm just aggravated, downright jaded, and it won't happen again.''

What Ms. Tennant and others found when they subscribed to Easy Download Music was not a song-selling service at all, but merely information on how to download file-sharing services like Kazaa, which provide access to the unrestricted swapping that Ms. Tennant was hoping to avoid.
