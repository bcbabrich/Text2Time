Stocks fell Thursday as manufacturing and labor market data heightened fears of a double-dip recession before Friday’s crucial employment report.

Major indexes were lower for a fourth consecutive day after suffering their worst quarter since late 2008, but losses eased near the end of the session, Reuters reports.

“Right now everyone is so concerned about a major ‘potential depression’ or deflation taking place. It’s really roiling the market,” Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vt, told Reuters.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 41.49 points, or 0.42 percent, to 9,732.53. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index shed 3.34 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,027.37. The Nasdaq composite index lost 7.88 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,101.36.

In a Reuters survey, economists expected Friday’s Labor Department report on June nonfarm payrolls to show a decline of 110,000.

Gold mining company stocks were among the hardest hit on Thursday after being one the few strong sectors in the second quarter as the price of gold fell.

Barrick Gold fell 5.1 percent to $43.06 and Newmont Mining slid 4.5 percent to $58.99. The PHLX gold/silver sector index fell 4.4 percent.

The spot gold price was down $43.30, to $1,198.95 an ounce.

“What you are seeing is clearly a nervous feeling about all assets, whether they be tangible or intangible, paper or not. The overall mood is bearish, and metals may not be the safe haven that you can just bank on,” said Scott Meyers, senior analyst at Pioneer Futures, which is based in New York.

Indicators suggested equity markets were oversold, but fears of a worse-than-expected jobs report, exacerbated by Thursday’s jobless claims data, kept buyers on the sidelines.

Thursday’s data also included the Institute for Supply Management’s barometer of manufacturing activity, which fell to its lowest level since December, and pending home sales, which dropped a record 30 percent in May.

Other data showed unemployment claims rose unexpectedly last week, heightening fears a labor market recovery was stalling.

With increased worries about the trajectory of the economy, investors turned to Treasuries as a safe haven and interest rates were lower most of the session. But as stocks erased their worst losses near the close, Treasuries declined. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 104 22/32, and the yield rose to 2.95 percent from 2.93 percent late Wednesday.

The euro rallied to a five-week high above $1.25 on Thursday, before falling back slightly to $1.2480 in late trading in New York. The dollar also fell against other currencies after the disappointing economic data heightened worries that the economic recovery is stalling in the United States.

Concerns about euro zone debt and liquidity problems eased further on Thursday after Spain successfully sold 3.5 billion euros of a five-year bond, adding to positive sentiment a day after European banks borrowed less money than expected from a European Central Bank tender.
