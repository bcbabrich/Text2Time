Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who was the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1984, said of his party's field for 1992: "Most of them will believe that running for President is simply an extension of running for Governor or Senator. Actually, it's entirely different. It's the vastness of the country, the differences, the demands of people and the sheer exhaustion of it all." A Narrow World View?

Democrats are particularly sensitive to the dangers of insular campaigns after their experience in 1988: The campaign of Gov. Dukakis stayed Boston-and-Cambridge-bound until the end, and its strategic decisions, in the view of many Democrats, reflected its narrow world view. Some political professionals wonder if Mr. Cuomo carries the seeds of a similar clannishness.

"Around any candidate, the question is how does he arrive at his decisions, who helps make the decisions, what's the team that decides," said Ann F. Lewis, a longtime Democratic strategist. "The early impression of Mario Cuomo is this has been a very small team of people who have known him a long time.

"The experience of other Presidential campaigns suggests that kind of team can take you through a couple of early primaries, but you can't run a national campaign that way," Ms. Lewis added. "The question of field operatives will be, do they have the capacity to grow? Can you trust, delegate, empower people to act on behalf of your campaign nationally?"

Jody Powell, the former press secretary to Jimmy Carter, who faced a similar task in melding outsiders into a home state campaign, was tactful. "If you're the Governor of Georgia, you're probably inclined to know that you don't know everything," said Mr. Powell, now a public relations executive in Washington. "I'm not saying this particularly about Mario, but being governor of a big state like New York or California, maybe you don't get quite enough of a sense that you need to learn some things about the rest of the country." Still, Mr. Powell noted that Mr. Cuomo had traveled the country over the years. 'Suspicious' New Yorkers

Another Democratic strategist, a veteran of Presidential politics who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said, "Traditionally, New York State Democrats are provincial in their view of talent: They're the fast lane, they're the Big Apple. It's a very tough style and a very suspicious style and it assumes that everyone has some other agenda."

But John Marino, the New York Democratic chairman who is a Cuomo ally, asserted that Mr. Cuomo has faced these kinds of charges before, and had shown in his 1982 campaign for governor how he can expand his base. "The fact of the matter is people all across the state joined together to elect him, and if this ever happened on a national level, we'd get a lot of help from people in different places," Mr. Marino said. "And we'd want it and welcome it."
