More Than Land

And land was not the half of it. There were the shipping interests, which perhaps accounted for the newspaper's enthusiasm for the San•Pedro harbor and an annexation of Hawaii: the automotive interests (Goodyear Tire and Rubber) and road construction interests (Western Construction) and gravel and rock interests (Southern California Rock and Gravel, Consolidated Rock Products) and oil interests (Royal Dutch Shell. Union Oil), which perhaps accounted for its disdain of mass transportation systems. The Times also helped to turn Southern California into one gigantic traffic circle from which there seems to be no egress, under the thumb of smog.

Not to mention the Santa Anita racetrack the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the chief of police and the Republican Party.

No wonder organized crime never had much of a chance in Los Angeles. The Chandlers and their various syndicates ran everything except the vice racket. No wonder a nonentity like Norris Poulson could be elected Mayor three times. Times political columnists decided who was electable. No wonder the Watts. riots came as such a surprise. The Times hadn't reported on the existence of Watts.

Aficionados of modern journalism will be most interested in the last third of “Thinking Big,” which is the story of how The Times changed itself after 1960 from a right‐wing parochial rag into one of the nation's finest newspapers, from a sponsor of Norris Poulson to a sponsor of Tom Bradley. is also the fascinating story of the politics of culture, of the reign of Dorothy (Buffy) Chandler over the institutions of spiritual uplift. And it usefully describes the new power elite of Los Angeles, in which there are actually some Democrats and Jews.

But I found myself absorbed in the early years. Every dynasty is started by some sort of bandit. General Otis certainly wrote like a bandit: “The apostles of disorder, the missionaries of unrest, the jawsmitbs of closed‐sho•p unionism, the haters of honest industry, the acquisitionists of other people's property, the enviers of other people's prosperity, the brawlers, the larcenists, the dynamiters, the I.W.W.'s and the friends of raising the devil generally are flocking to the standards of Absalom. The air is incarnadined and made mephitic with their presence.”
