The director of the $2.4 billion trust for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth control device made by the A.H. Robins Company yesterday announced the initial settlements that would be offered by the trust.

A trustee, Kenneth R. Feinberg, estimated that as many as 100,000 of the 195,000 claimants might take the initial settlement payment, which is not meant to compensate victims who received the most serious harm from the device.

Under the initial payment, which is being called Option 1, women who were injured by the intrauterine device will be offered $725. Husbands whose wives were injured and children were born with birth defects will be offered $300. And women who are unsure as to whether the Dalkon Shield caused their injuries will be offered $125.

All claimants have the right to reject the Option 1 offers.

Mr. Feinberg said that the trust was setting up Option 2, which would be a schedule for compensating more seriously injured users.
