To the Editor:

Your Nov. 11 editorial on giving ''clean needles'' to New York City drug addicts because shared needles have so widely contributed to the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome reflects the thinking in most quarters of the drug-treatment community.

AIDS has become a tragic daily circumstance in our lives. Since the relationship between AIDS and the intravenous drug abuser is based solely on the shared ''works,'' were this to be circumvented, this risk group would no longer be at risk. That risk profile would be absent as well for the two other diseases that are prevalent in the intravenous abusing population, type B hepatitis and infective endocarditis (which is a serious and often fatal infection of the heart valves).

Right now the prospect of a trial of needle distribution in New York City is appropriate.

But thinking well beyond such a trial, we would like to see other measures adopted before there is a further widening of the gyre to nonrisk groups, such as sexual partners and the newborn of the infected.

In view of projections that hundreds of thousands of people will contract and succumb to acquired immune deficiency syndrome within the next five years, we recommend that the following be included on any list of the measures that must be taken:

* Legislation to rescind laws that criminalize possession of hypodermic syringes without a prescription in those states (New York and 12 others) where such laws are in force.
