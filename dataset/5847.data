The growers cannot sell their land, because the bottom has fallen out of the market as below-freezing temperatures in three of the last four winters damaged or killed trees.

The freeze last December ruined many growers, said Mr. Smoak, who owns groves himself. ''For those still in business, canker is like knowing there's an assassin out there in the night and all we can do is try to lock the windows and pray it'll go away.'' 'Can't Hardly Grow Grass'

Part of the problem on The Ridge is that while the sandy soil is excellent for the cultivation of citrus, it is almost useless for any other profitable form of agriculture.

''You can't hardly grow grass on this land,'' Mr. Smoak said with a shake of his head. ''You can't even call it soil. What it is is a rooting medium. Soil on The Ridge is just something to hold a tree in place.''

He had planned ''one last roll of the dice'' in his groves and intended to replant trees once the danger of a freeze was past this winter, he said. Now the possibility that canker would destroy the new trees has lengthened the odds, and he said he was not sure what his next move would be.

''What I'm facing is 25 years of hard work down the drain,'' he said. ''A lot of people don't know where they are, or where they are going.'' Seeing It Slip Away

Joe Symmes, who is tall and handsome in a rawboned way, confesses the confusion of one who worked hard, did ''the proper thing,'' but stood helplessly as it all slipped inexorably into disaster.
