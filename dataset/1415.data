An LOT Polish Airlines flight slid into a Warsaw airport on its belly on Tuesday, sparks flying and smoke hissing, crash landing onto the runway without the aid of its landing gear, which refused to drop.

There were 231 people on board the flight, which originated at Newark Liberty International Airport, The Associated Press reported, and no one was injured.

The president of LOT, Marcin Piróg, said the pilots realized there was a problem with the Boeing 767 about half an hour after leaving Newark, The A.P. reported. Once in Warsaw, the plane circled over the airport for about an hour trying to drop its landing gear — and trying to drain its fuel to lessen the risk of an explosive fire.

According to The Guardian, the runway had been covered with flame retardant foam and the plane was immediately hosed with water and foam once it landed.
