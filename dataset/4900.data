President Bush's proposal for further troop reductions in Europe won bipartisan praise on Capitol Hill tonight, kindling new hope among even his harshest Democratic critics for deeper cuts in the military budget.

Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said she was delighted with the President's announcement. ''Just when you thought you had a Cold War budget,'' she said, ''boom, there's hope.''

Although Mr. Bush outlined his proposal in his State of the Union Message, most lawmakers had received word of it earlier in the evening, before they assembled in the House chamber to hear him. He received a standing ovation when he mentioned the troop reduction plan, but he drew warmer and longer applause when he spoke of restored democracy in Panama and when he declared that his budget proposals would assure a balanced budget by 1992 ''with no new taxes.''

Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the proposed reductions very positive and said they fit the changing circumstances in Europe as well as the fiscal pressures at home.
