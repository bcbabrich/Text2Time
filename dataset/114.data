“While business is strong, there is an undercurrent of fear and alarm regarding the trade wars and a potential recession,” an unidentified executive with a chemical products company is quoted as saying. A computer and electronic products manager told the institute that “tariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy over all.”

The Trump administration’s tariffs have affected many factory owners who depend on overseas suppliers for components and raw materials. And with Beijing imposing retaliatory tariffs on American goods, many manufacturers reliant on sales to China are feeling pain as well. All of this makes manufacturers more vulnerable to trade tensions than service-economy companies.

At RJM Music in Vista, Calif., tariffs on LCD screens from China have increased the cost of that component by 25 percent, prompting a co-owner, Sheri Menelli, to rethink growth plans. Her company makes foot pedals and controllers that help guitarists integrate effects while they play, gear that it sells to rock stars and ordinary musicians.

“We’ve been eating it for the last two months,” Ms. Menelli said. “We are trying to pass it on, but you end up reducing volume.”

Buying screens from another country isn’t an option. “We’ve looked at every other LCD, but the ones we need come from China,” she said.

Ms. Menelli’s company has three full-time employees and two part-timers. She had planned to hire a third part-time employee but has decided to hold off for now.

“We keep hearing on TV that China is paying for the tariffs,” she said, referring to a statement President Trump has made frequently. “I can tell you that right now I’m paying for the tariffs.”
