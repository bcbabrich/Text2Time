COULD you use $10,496? That's what the average household in New York State would get back through the tax cuts approved by Congress, according to the Tax Foundation, a research group in Washington. Because so many New Yorkers, including middle-class ones, are in high tax brackets, the average windfall in New York would be $3,000 higher than in the rest of America.

Yet New Yorkers do not especially want the money, according to The New York Times/CBS News Poll released today. The tax cuts (vetoed by President Clinton) were favored by only 14 percent of the respondents statewide, and just 13 percent in the city. Almost two-thirds preferred using the budget surplus to ''preserve programs like Medicare and Social Security.''

You could quibble with the question's wording, which presumes that current taxes can finance future benefits. That may be like presuming that you can give a crack addict money for his child's college education. The question could have been worded differently: ''Is your retirement money safer in a 401(k) account or in the hands of politicians up for re-election next year?''

But New Yorkers would probably still give politicians the money. No matter how many studies come out showing that the city's residents pay more than their share of taxes to Albany and Washington, and get back less in return, they keep voting for taxes. Gov. George E. Pataki, elected against the wishes of the city's voters, did manage to cut state income taxes in 1996. But even that did not change much.
