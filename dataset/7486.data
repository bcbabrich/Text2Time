LOUISVILLE, Aug. 31 (AP) —Bob Evans, the Kentucky Boxing Commissioner, said today he would not permit a closed‐circuit telecast in this state of a return match between Cassius Clay, the heavyweight champion, and Sonny Liston.

He expressed the belief that most other state commissioners had the power to act similarly.

Evans attended last week's meeting of the World Boxing Association at Norfolk, Va., in which the group voted “to suspend indefinitely any and all persons, including the referee, who might have anything to do with a Clay‐Liston return bout.”

Evans told The Louisville Courier‐Journal:

“We have no quarrel with Clay. All he has to do is sit out the Dec. 1 expiration of the contract with Jack Nilon [of Intercontinental Promotions] and then fight any recognized contender before the end of his first year as champion. That will keep him on top, clean as a hound's‐tooth.
