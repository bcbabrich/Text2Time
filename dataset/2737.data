Re ''Iraqi General Says 4,000 Volunteered for Suicide Attacks'' (front page, March 31):

It's frightening how much death and destruction can be wrought by fanatics. As you say, American forces ''boast far superior weaponry and technology but remain vulnerable to fanaticism.''

The parallel between what the coalition forces are facing and what the Israeli military faces is clear. This is not about who has more military might, but about how much death and injury can be caused by terrorists who hide in hospitals and places of worship, who masquerade as civilians and who use women and children as human shields.

Regardless of one's views about the timing of this war, there is no question that our war in Iraq is a war against terror.
