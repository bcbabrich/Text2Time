Hensher is a 37-year-old English novelist and reviewer who has a column in The Independent and has been a Booker Prize judge. He tells us in an afterword that the novelist A. .S Byatt urged him to write a long novel, and he's made it in homage to the 19th century's literary greats. Couched in their accents, riven with their preoccupations and perceptions, ''The Mulberry Empire'' descends on London drawing rooms, Crimean estates and oriental palaces in the very language of Victorian novelists.

If there is something immediately odd about the atmosphere, it's because Hensher imitates Thackeray writing about the division of rich and poor in Victorian London; he imitates Kipling writing about the gorgeous East; imitates -- who? Gissing, I fancy -- writing about a literary cove called Stokes. In the Russian scenes, I expected, for a moment, that he would try to scale the hare-coursing of ''War and Peace,'' but it was only a nod, and he elegantly sheered away toward the Crimean estates (their versts, their town of S-, their contented landlords). Hensher also imitates Conrad on the sea: ''Even when the winds started up again -- and it was as astonishing, as imprevue an event as their disappearance -- we still felt becalmed, marooned, suspended in time.''

Hensher's ventriloquism slides the novel into a sort of liminal space, between reader and writer -- a space like Afghanistan itself, devoured by Western eyes, unwittingly besieged by Western dreams that lead to blunders, retreats and surprise attacks coming down off the old brown hills, with armies like narratives coursing through the defiles. Hensher is alive to the ironies of the historical novel. As they say, the past is another country; it's also a country like Afghanistan as it once was: you can't go there. We know too little about the place, but at the same time we know too much. We are burdened with hindsight.

''He looked up into the utter clarity of the Afghan sky, and saw something he had never seen before; a single cloud . . . a single, brilliantly white line, shining with the reflected sun, being drawn as if with a piece of chalk. Burnes looked at it, never having seen it before. Far above, tens of thousands of feet above, a jet plane was tearing across the sky. He looked: and to his mind came a single dictionary thought: disaster. . . . What it meant, he did not know.''

It happens once, this eruption into the present day, and it's enough to catch the reader offguard, with his guilty knowledge. Hensher sets out to disturb our assumptions and keep us guessing. ''There is no power in the world, even the cruellest and most arbitrary, which does not believe itself to be merciful, compassionate and wise,'' says a delightfully enigmatic guide named Mohan Lal to his English employer, Burgess. ''We are men of the world, are we not? We both know that to seduce an intelligent woman, we comment on her beauty; to lay siege to a beautiful woman, it is best to compliment her on her intelligence. . . . Come now, Burnes-ji; you believe what you are told, because it is what you like to hear.''
