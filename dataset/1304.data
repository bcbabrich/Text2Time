The American International Group said on Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with MetLife to sell shares it owns in its rival, gained as part of a deal between the two insurers, earlier than expected.

A.I.G. could reap more than $9 billion in proceeds from the stock sales, based on MetLife’s closing share price of $46.04. Its holdings in MetLife are composed of common and preferred stock that are equivalent to 146.8 million shares and equity units with a stated value of $3 billion.

A.I.G. is itself preparing for an enormous offering of its own shares that would drastically cut the Treasury Department‘s 92.1 percent ownership stake in the insurer. That stock sale, called a re-I.P.O., is likely to come in May, people briefed on the matter previously told DealBook.

A.I.G. gained its MetLife holdings when it sold its American Life Insurance Company unit to its competitor last year, one of several deals aimed at raising money to repay its $182 billion taxpayer-financed bailout. The specific mix of MetLife equities was chosen to cap A.I.G.’s ownership in a major rival.

Under the terms of the deal worked out by A.I.G., MetLife and the Treasury Department, A.I.G. will sell the common shares and equity units. MetLife will buy back the preferred shares, drawing largely from the proceeds from a concurrent stock offering of 68.5 million shares.

The discussions among the three parties came together over the past few weeks, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. All three agreed to expedite the timetable, which would help A.I.G. shed its ties to the government. MetLife would also benefit from removing an overhang of having so many shares — equivalent to about 14 percent of its outstanding stock — tied up by A.I.G.

One reason driving the decision was the rise in MetLife’s share price, which is almost at its one-year high.

“We appreciate MetLife’s agreement to permit the proposed sales,” Robert S. Miller, A.I.G.’s chairman, said in a statement. “As a result, A.I.G. expects to take another major step forward.”

A.I.G. is expected to market its stock sales on Wednesday and Thursday, people briefed on the matter told DealBook.

The lead bookrunners for A.I.G.’s stock offerings are Goldman Sachs Citigroup and Credit Suisse.
