A fire swept through a crowded gambling club in Tokyo's busiest entertainment district early today, killing at least 44 people and injuring 3 others, the police said. It was the worst incident of its kind in Tokyo in two decades.

The fire's cause remained unknown. Initial reports described the disaster as an explosion that appeared to have been set off when an employee opened the door to the building, a mah-jongg parlor in the Shinjuku Ward, at about 1 a.m.

Later reports suggested that the incident began with a fire that set off the explosion, which ripped a large hole in the wall of the establishment. The mah-jongg club was on the third floor of a building that contained restaurants and sex clubs, according to televised news reports.

The fire took place in a crime-ridden and seedy neighborhood where Chinese gangs are active, but there was no immediate indication the fire had been deliberately set.
