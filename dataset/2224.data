Peter Applebome had a column in The New York Times over the weekend asking whether Cory Booker’s political abilities would be enough to help him cope with Newark’s many problems. The headline pretty much says it all: “Where Winning Isn’t Easy, but It’s Easier Than Governing.”

The Star-Ledger ran a profile on Mr. Booker, leading with his decision in 1998 to move into the Brick Towers.

The Ledger also has an analytical article on how the absence of Mayor Sharpe James from this year’s elections has thrown the council races wide open.
