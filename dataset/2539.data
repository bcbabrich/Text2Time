The peer-to-peer world of the Internet is taking a step onto the nation's freeways in a cellphone application that aims to offer up-to-the-second traffic information.

Until now peer-to-peer networks have conjured up file-sharing systems like Napster and Kazaa or social networking organizations like Friendster, Orkut and Linked-in.

But Zipdash, a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., hopes to take advantage of the growing number of mobile telephones with global positioning satellite receivers to gather the travel speeds of thousands or tens of thousands of drivers, displaying highway conditions as maps on cellphone screens.

The Zipdash application displays a map of traffic speeds as green, yellow and red arrows, graphically representing traffic jams and bottlenecks. The company plans to add features, including route planning and accident alerts. The service will be free to cellphone users and Zipdash is planning to create a business by selling accurate traffic information to Web sites and other publishers.
