The cloud of volcanic gas that burst from Lake Nios and killed more than 1,500 people was preceded by a series of explosions heard by villagers a few hours earlier, an Italian scientist said today.

The volcanologist, Franco Barbieri, who spent three days interviewing witnesses about the seismic activity at the crater lake in northwest Cameroon, said residents first noticed smoke and steam escaping from the lake about 4 P.M. on Aug. 21.

At around 8 P.M., a small explosion was heard and between 9 P.M. and 10 P.M., two or three larger explosions were heard, followed immediately by the gas, he said.

''We have determined that the explosion of gas produced a wave in the lake that touched the entire shore,'' Mr. Barbieri told the state-run Radio Cameroon. ''It destroyed a good part of the soil and vegetation on the edge of the lake.''
