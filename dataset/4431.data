Two new polls indicate that Americans are deeply divided over President Clinton's job performance so far, and are almost evenly split over the first major issue his Administration has tackled, the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces.

A poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for Newsweek magazine showed that although 51 percent of those surveyed approved of Mr. Clinton's job performance 32 percent disapproved. It is the highest disapproval rating for any new President since such surveys were begun in the 1950's.

For most other Presidents, disapproval ratings this early in their first term were in single digits. The only exception -- and the previous high -- was a 13 percent disapproval rating for Ronald Reagan after the first week of his Presidency in January 1981, Newsweek reported.

The latest poll, based on 774 telephone interviews conducted last Thursday and Friday, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
