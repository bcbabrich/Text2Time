In two weeks, New York City will submit its bid for the 2012 Summer Games. Last night, the city strutted some of its stuff by gathering more than 100 Olympic athletes from the New York area who competed from 1920 to 2000.

It may not curry much favor with the United States Olympic Committee. But the parade of Olympians who collectively won a total of 180 medals, including 83 gold in 35 different sports, celebrated New York's rich Olympic history.

Among the all-star cast at the New York Athletic Club was 92-year-old John Slade, a member of the 1948 field hockey team, who says he will always remember the cheers of the 120,000 fans at Wembley Stadium in London during the opening ceremony; Dick Button, who won gold medals in figure skating in 1948 and 1952; Doug Heir, the four-time Paralympian and 2000 U.S. Paralympic team captain in track and field; and Diane Dixon, who won a gold medal in track in 1984 and a silver in 1988.

Daniel Doctoroff, founder and president of NYC2012, the nonprofit organization authorized by the city to lead its efforts to host the 2012 Olympics, said the reunion was a way of honoring the ''circle of Olympians'' living in the New York area, including 63 in New Jersey, 60 in Pennsylvania, 28 in Connecticut.
