Last week Michael Jordan, the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, said that he would be open to changing the team’s name to the Hornets should the franchise in New Orleans follow through with plans to change its name to something more befitting that city.

“It’s definitely an interest down the road, but right now it’s the New Orleans Hornets,” Jordan told The Charlotte Observer. “We would definitely entertain the opportunity. That’s as much as we can say right now. We’ve heard the community ask the question, and we would listen.”

Attempting to invoke nostalgia for a team that dates only to the 1988-89 season probably does not work on the same level as resurrecting the Browns name in Cleveland. But the name would recall memories of the teams that starred Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning and were more entertaining than any Bobcats squad.

A name change makes more sense for the New Orleans franchise, a city known for many things more positive than the largest of the eusocial wasps. Unfortunately the best name out there may be the Jazz, the name of the team that played in New Orleans from 1974 to 1979 before relocating to Salt Lake City.

Perhaps a trade can be engineered where the franchise in Charlotte becomes the Hornets, the one in New Orleans becomes the Jazz, and the one in Utah picks an entirely new name. If the amusingly named Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies could somehow be included in the transaction, then basketball team names might make a great deal more geographical sense.

The ultimate decision on whether Charlotte could bring back the Hornets name would not be up to the team regardless of what New Orleans decides. The rights would be determined by the N.B.A.

Becoming a Dual Threat

After consecutive seasons in which he appeared in 31 or fewer games, Anderson Varejao, the Cavaliers’ center, is finally healthy, and consistent time on the court seems to be agreeing with him. Through Friday, he was leading the N.B.A. with a career-high 15.1 rebounds a game.

Always considered a talented rebounder, Varejao is starting to prove he is not a one-dimensional player by contributing more on offense. The defensive-minded Varejao has averaged 14.9 points a game, besting his previous career high by more than 4 points a game.

Despite those improvements, his most impressive improvement may be with his free throws. With a career percentage of 60.9 percent from the line coming into the season, Varejao is now hitting 80.4 percent of his free throws. Because he plays under the basket and draws a number of fouls, being able to capitalize on them is a huge boost in his value.
