WASHINGTON, Nov. 2—The United States and three of its principal West European allies have exchanged conciliatory messages in the last week, all designed to patch up differences that had arisen over American policies and actions in the Middle East crisis.

The latest, a top Administration official said today, was a letter from President Nixon delivered yesterday to Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany in answer to the Chancellor's letter of Sunday.

Replying to Mr. Brandt's statement that the Nixon Administration could have been quicker and more explicit in keeping American allies informed of its assessment of the crisis and American moves, Mr. Nixon is understood to have promised fuller consultation in the future.

It was believed that similar pledges had been made to other allies. Mr. Brandt said in his letter that West Germany was upset to discover last week that the United States Continued to resupply Israel with American weapons after the cease‐fire of Oct. 22.
