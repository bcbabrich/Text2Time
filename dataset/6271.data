According to Mr. Zumwalt, Mr. Bull took out last July 11 a tape that purported to cover all conversations held in the President's hideaway in the Executive Office Building from April 11 through April 16. It was on April 15, a Sunday, that the President talked with Mr. Dean for an hour, after 9 P.M. But it was not until Oct. 27 or 28, the White House says, that Mr. Buzhardt or anyone else discovered that the tape that Mr. Bull had withdrawn from security on July 11 did not contain the Nixon‐Dean conversation at all. The President's special counsel told the court today that one six‐hour tape had been available in the office in the Executive Office Building to record the April 14–15 weekend, and that it had been exhausted during a busy weekend of talk before the Dean conversation began Sunday night.

Interviewed after today's hearing, Mr. Buzhardt said that the last conversation appearing on the April 15 tape was one between Mr. Nixon and Richard G. Kleindienst, then Attorney General, after lunch on Sunday.

The White House counsel said that no attempt to audit the April 15 tape for the Dean conversation had been made until last weekend because “we thought we were going to win the suit” brought by Archibald Cox, then the special Watergate prosecutor, to obtain the tapes for the grand jury.

Mr. Dean testified before the Senate Watergate committee earlier this year that the President had told him on April 15 that Mr. Nixon had been “foolish” to discuss clemency for E. Howard Hunt Jr., one of the convicted Watergate burglars, with Charles W. Colson, then special counsel to the President.

The second conversation at issue—a telephone conversation with Mr. Mitchell—was never recorded, Mr. Buzhardt said yesterday, because the President made the call from a hall phone in the White House that was not attached to the recording system.

At the White House, officials provided anonymously much the same scenario on the unrecorded conversations that Mr. Buzhardt was outlining in Federal court. They said that a six‐hour tape would have handled any ordinary weekend, since Mr. Nixon was often out of town on Saturday and Sunday and, when he was not, rarely used the Executive Office Building facility extensively.

Explaining why the missing conversations had been discovered so recently, a White House official said, “We believed the President would never let go of these tapes, and no one believed there was any need to find out what was on them.”
