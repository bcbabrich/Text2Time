Earvin (Magic) Johnson, the Los Angeles Laker guard who missed the first two games of the season with shingles, was given medical clearance to play last night against the Phoenix Suns. . . . Marc Buoniconti, the Citadel linebacker who was paralyzed making a tackle in last Saturday's game against East Tennessee, was honored by his teammates. They voted to wear his number 59 on their helmets for the rest of the season. . . . Three major league baseball players, including Willie Randolph of the Yankees, are being sued in Federal court by a New York bank that claims they defaulted on payments on promissory notes.

The Banke Leumi Trust Co. claims Randolph, Jerry Mumphrey of the Astros and Claudell Washington of the Braves executed promissory notes in December 1983 for a total of $640,000, but defaulted after making only $200,000 in payments. Legal papers say the promissory notes were signed as part of an investment in a shopping mall in New Jersey in December 1983.
