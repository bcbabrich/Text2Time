rrxhAs long as Reagan evidences no qualities of an economist nor of a statesman, one will justifiably not expect any American iniative to defuse the time bomb that has been ticking away for years, until after 1989 when a new gentleman sits in the White House. Completely apart from this political influence, the uncertainty of business trends has increased sharply in the wake of the stock market crash; it will take months before one can see to what degree the global destruction of hundreds of millions in potential buying power will paralyze economic development. The financial markets must adjust to the new situation. The stock crash will without doubt stimulate the existing discussions. Neue Zurcher Zeitung Paris

rrxhRonald Reagan, accused from all sides of being responsible for the worsening budgetary impasse -which, along with the United States' current account deficit, is the main element of the world's economic imbalances - has been led to open the door halfway to an eventual tax increase, a door that he had until now kept carefully closed. . . . Ronald Reagan, by accepting a meeting with Congress on that subject, acknowledged that all the economists' analyses were well-founded: the explosive combination of the American internal and external deficits calls for fast, strong-willed action. . . . The end of six years of the dialogue of the deaf between the White House and Congress on the budgetary problem was well worth saluting. . .

Following the bitter Wall Street downturn, there is one other lesson: promises and overtures will no longer suffice. Stock traders want action. Will they have it? Le Monde London

rrxhUnless his statement acknowledging the gravity of the situation is a harbinger of better things to come, the only charitable description of President Reagan's performance over the last week is that it has amply demonstrated his known limitations. Once the beneficiary of favorable circumstances, he appears to lack the capacity to handle adversity. . . There is, sadly, a fundamental inability at the top to grasp complex issues, not seen at a Presidential level since Herbert Hoover. . . . What is needed is a realization in the U.S. capital that neither the nation nor the world can wait until a new President is installed for a coherent set of policies to emerge. . . . Gramm-Rudman, for all its deficiencies, at least provides a starting point. This year's target must be met as a minimum, if government is not to cede policy-making to the markets entirely. Equally important is the recognition that a managed decline in the value of the dollar, far from demonstrating a failure of national virility, may be the least of present evils. Financial Times Rome

rrxhSince the stock market is ever more the metaphor of freedom in financial garb, October's catastrophe opens the way to more than a simple economic contraction. The crash is the prelude to the redimensioning of that freedom, it promises the advent of another phase in the cycle of American history. Today all signs indicate that 1987's Black Monday will bring an end to deregulation and the return to the age of public monitoring and regulations. And the wild excesses of today's Wall Street, abandoned to itself by political power, will again become a more reasonable stock market game.

And it is even amusing to observe how the boom of Reagan prosperity will not turn into another depression thanks not to the self-balancing virtues of the market, which today are totally absent, but rather thanks to the social and banking safety belts set up by Franklin Roosevelt. If people still are not questioning whether banks will fail, and they don't run to collect their savings, it is because the state, through the Federal Reserve, is ready to intervene. It is in fact Roosevelt's ghost which will save America from the risks of Reagan's experiment. La Repubblica
