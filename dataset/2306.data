A botched joke turned into a second day story today as Democrats fighting for re-election responded to the “John Kerry-insulted-our-troops saga.” And the blogs were right there to take notes.

Harold Ford, Jr., the Democratic Senatorial candidate in Tennessee, said that Mr. Kerry, “whatever the intent,” should apologize for any insult he may have caused, which Mr. Kerry later did.



The Tennessee based Volunteer Voters said that Mr. Kerry’s words put Mr. Ford in a difficult spot.

“I don’t think the comment was a big deal,” the site said, “and his explanation of a fumbled joke is plausible. However, in terms of public perception it is disasterous (sic). Ford had no choice but to denounce it.”



In Pennsylvania, Mr. Kerry canceled an appearance with another Democratic candidate for Senator, Bob Casey. Mr. Casey did not ask Mr. Kerry to apologize and, like Mr. Kerry himself, used the issue to criticize the Republican handling of the war in Iraq.

PennPatriot, a conservative site, said that Mr. Casey’s refusal to condemn Mr. Kerry “just goes to show you that the Democratic Party wants political power so bad even their candidates, like Bob Casey, are willing to say or do anything to get elected.”

In Virginia, Jim Webb, the Democratic challenger facing a tight race against Senator George Allen, said, “If that’s John Kerry’s idea of a joke, he needs to work on his punch line. But at the same time this administration has to accept the realities of failed strategic policy.”

The Richmond Democrat blog thought that Tuesday may not be the only Election Day on which Mr. Kerry’s feels the effect of his mishandled joke.

“I think Kerry recognizes how bad his stumble was – he’s dropped off the campaign trail for this year,” allowing his competitors for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2008 “to go out and campaign for fellow Democrats and rack up support while he has to sit on the bench.”
