Less than two months ago, marketing company Valassis Communications was pitching the virtues of its $1.3 billion acquisition of Advo, a direct-mail concern. But the transaction has since collapsed in a hailstorm of recriminations between the two companies, illustrating how a relatively straightforward deal can go very, very wrong.

Valassis’s allegations are blunt. It claims that Advo misrepresented its financial health during the negotiations and withheld negative information until after the deal was announced. As a result, it says it has the right to cancel the merger agreement.

Advo was not shy in its response, either. In a letter sent to Valassis’s board of directors dated Aug. 29 and made public on Friday, it said Valassis was “suffering from a severe case of ‘buyer’s remorse'” and noted that Valassis’s share price plunged after the transaction was made public. Advo also compared Valassis’s behavior to that of Tyson Foods, which famously tried to terminate its agreement to acquire IBP. In a landmark ruling in 2001, a Delaware court ruled against Tyson, forcing it to consummate the deal.

Valassis made its case in a complaint filed Wednesday in Delaware’s Court of Chancery. Though the document was filed under seal, Valassis has since released a redacted version that makes for intriguing reading, as long as you are not afraid of some legalese.

The complaint describes an on-and-off negotiation process between Valassis, advised by Bear Stearns, and Advo, advised by Citigroup. It culminated in a “go/no go” meeting on June 30 in Boston, attended by top executives, lawyers and investment bankers on both sides. They walked away with an agreement for Valassis to buy Advo for $37 per share in cash.

After the deal was announced on July 6, however, “the truth begins to emerge,” Valassis said in the complaint.

Exactly what emerged? It is hard to say: What follows is a series of redacted pages with tantalizing section headers such as “Valassis Obtains Board Minutes Revealing Advo’s Knowledge of the Fraud.”

Valassis said it tried to conduct further due diligence but ran into “unreasonable restrictions.” Relations between the two companies grew strained, Valassis suggests:

On Aug. 17, 2006, Eric Stovall of KPMG visited Advo’s corporate headquarters and was met by Mr. Hutter, Hal Manoian, Advo’s director of accounting, and Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, counsel for Advo. Mr. Stovall was told that the general ledger would be made available only on a read-only basis and that Advo would not answer questions unless the questions were put in writing. […] Because Mr. Stovall was not permitted to download the general ledger, such that he could manipulate and/organize the ledger entries, it was impossible for him to analyze the data in any meaningful way.

In its letter, Advo disputed the notion that it has been putting up roadblocks. It said it has provided Valassis with “reasonable access” to its books in the past month — but perhaps not the “full and unfettered access” that Valassis had demanded.
