As fat envelopes compete with shrinking paychecks in the mailboxes of some American families, The Choice is soliciting your questions about financial aid. By using the comment box below, please submit questions for consideration by Mark Kantrowitz, an expert on paying for college and the founder (and publisher) of FinAid.org.

He’ll be paying particular attention to questions from accepted applicants and their families, but may well entertain more general queries, too, so send them along. We expect to begin posting his answers on Monday, April 6, and to continue through at least April 10.

Mr. Kantrowitz is also publisher of FastWeb.com, a scholarship matching site, and the author of “FastWeb College Gold: The Step by Step Guide to Paying for College” (Collins).

“Not surprisingly,” Mr. Kantrowitz says, he “was able to pay for his undergraduate education (at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) through scholarships and summer employment.”

“Guidance Office” is a regular feature on The Choice. It is a forum intended to give readers access to some of the most influential and thoughtful people in the field of college admissions.
