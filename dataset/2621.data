Yes, there was a surge of patriotism after the Sept. 11 attacks, and yes, American soldiers are now in Iraq. Ms. Marenoff explained her mission in less far-reaching terms. She said she had been hired to broaden the Intrepid's audience and message. ''We're about the humanity behind the hardware,'' she said. ''There's a common thread of heroism running through the Intrepid -- the idea, 'I can be a hero in everyday life.' Or if veterans come in and see they've been honored, then we've succeeded on that level.''

Ms. Marenoff is 38, two years younger than G.I. Joe. And he ''was totally in the forefront of the boys in my childhood,'' she said. ''You remember G.I. Joes being strong figures that represent heroism, very American, pure in a way. Parents were proud to have their kids play with them.''

And Hasbro is happy to have G.I. Joe be something of a historical figure. ''We don't pursue today's events in the brand,'' Mr. DePriest said. ''There's no Iraqi Freedom G.I. Joe. Instead, we choose to take a higher road and commemorate heroes in uniform without tying them to specific events.''

One recent Joe -- a 12-inch figure -- is a Navy Seal in an orange vest. Another features Duke, a sergeant on the G.I. Joe team, or so says an identification card on the package. Duke is thoroughly modern -- so much so that he talks. When his stomach is pushed, his mouth opens in an O-shape and recorded phrases like ''lock and load'' or ''get the others -- we're going in'' come out. But there is a disjointedness to Joe's speech patterns. He. Talks. Like. This. With. A. Noticeable. Pause. Between. Each. Word. No. Battlefield. Commander. Could. Survive. Giving. Orders. This. Slowly.

Which is not what Mr. DePriest remembers from his boyhood. ''You could impart any sort of adventure on G.I. Joe,'' Mr. DePriest said. ''What we loved was he was a real guy, a real hero, as opposed to a superhero or a robot. When you get three boys together thinking about adventures you could do with G.I. Joe, the options were limitless. G.I. Joe was a great thing that really brought us together and fueled our imaginations.''

What he imagined, he said, was not necessarily military action. ''We grew up in a time when the G.I. Joe on the shelves had shifted gears from the military to what was called the adventure team, the fuzzy hair and the kung fu grip. One of the things that Hasbro advertised was there are 50 adventures of G.I. Joe, and there are literally 50 sets of clothes you could get. We fell under the spell of this globe-trotting adventurer who was part environmentalist and part kung fu expert. We joined up on adventures that went all over our backyard.''
