WASHINGTON, Nov. 1—In his confirmation hearings before the Senate Rules Committee, Gerald Ford, the Vice‐Presidential nominee, recalled that President Eisenhower had a very simple rule for public men: “Get all the facts and all the good counsel you can, and then do what's best for America.”

If President Nixon were to follow this advice in his present predicament, he would undoubtedly resign, but there is no evidence that he intends to do so or even that he is seeking the counsel of the conservative elders in the Republican party.

Instead, he is mounting a counteroffensive to prove that he is indispensable to the conduct of the nation's foreign policy, that his “detente” with the Soviet Union produced peace in Vietnam and a ceasefire in the Middle East, and that he is being persecuted by partisan liberals in the Congress, the Watergate prosecutor's office, the press and the networks.

It is hard to square this, however, with the comments coming in from conservative quarters at home and abroad. The Wall Street Journal remarked in a leading editorial the other day: “The President, in short, has become a pitiful helpless giant. For the most part, he has no one to blame but himself. The Watergate burglary did, after all, occur, as did the attempted cover‐up.
