The father of a white teen-ager charged with murder in the Howard Beach case testified yesterday that his son had told him two days after the incident, ''Daddy, I didn't do anything.''

The father, Harold Kern, said that his son, Scott, 18 years old, also had told him, ''Daddy, I don't know what happened about anybody getting killed.''

The father, a 46-year-old utility company employee, testified in State Supreme Court in Queens at the trial of his son and three other white teen-agers on murder or manslaughter charges stemming from what the prosecution says was a racial attack by a gang of young whites on three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, in December.

One of the black men, Michael Griffith, 23, was struck and killed by a car when, the prosecution contends, he was chased onto the Belt Parkway by Mr. Kern and his co-defendants, Jon Lester and Michael Pirone, both 18, and Jason Ladone, 17. Statement to Police Challenged
