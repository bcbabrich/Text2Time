EVERYTHING about Cecilia (Mia Farrow) is tinged with melancholy, including the time - the depressed 1930's - and the place, a drab little New Jersey town where even the sunlight looks gray. Her husband, Monk (Danny Aiello), a big, short-tempered lug, isn't a bad sort, really, and, like almost every other man in town, he's out of a job and not looking for work. However, when he's had a few beers, he's inclined to push her around a bit.

Cecilia presents her objections to Monk in the form of extremely tentative observations: ''All you do is drink and play dice and I wind up getting smacked.'' Replies Monk with reason: ''I always warn you first.'' Cecilia is even a failure as a waitress in the town's single, very greasy spoon.

It's no wonder that Cecilia, like millions of other Americans of her time, finds life on the silver screen not only preferable to - but more real than - the world around her. One day, after going through a bad patch at the diner and with Monk, she is sitting in the Jewel Theater, watching something called ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' for the umpteenth time, when the film's handsome, four-square juvenile, a pith-helmeted character named Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), steps down from the screen and into Cecilia's life. As Cecilia later confides to her sister, ''I just met a wonderful man. He's fictional, but you can't have everything.''

This is the real ''Purple Rose of Cairo,'' which is the title of Woody Allen's new comedy, as well as of the movie within it.
