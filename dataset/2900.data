Brendan Behan, the loquacious Irish novelist and playwright who died in 1964 of diabetes complicated by alcoholism (he was only 41), once jokingly described himself as ''a drinker with a writing problem.'' Peter Sheridan's gentle, misty-eyed screen adaptation of Behan's coming-of-age novel, ''Borstal Boy,'' barely hints at the marathon toper to come in a scene in which the teenage Brendan gets pleasantly tipsy on cider.

The film, set in the early 1940's, is a likable rites-of-passage memory piece doused in period nostalgia, including the prominent use of vintage Movietone newsreels to mark the events of World War II. While incarcerated in a Borstal (a British reform school), the teenage Brendan discovered the theater by reading Oscar Wilde, stood up to the institution's resident bully, tried and failed to escape, and formed two romantic relationships. By the end of the film, he has blossomed from an introverted rebel into an endearing, self-assured future Great Writer.

Most of the movie is set in the reform school in East Anglia where Brendan was incarcerated after being caught taking explosives into Liverpool. A fervent Irish republican, he was legally too young at 16 to be sent to a regular prison. As depicted in the movie, the institution lacks the ominous aura of a modern reform school and looks less like a penal institution than a Spartan summer camp. Although violence erupts there, it isn't endemic to the school, whose stern but kindly warden, Joyce (Michael York), genuinely cares about the young men under his charge.

As played by the American actor Shawn Hatosy, Brendan comes across as a wholesome, sensitive idealist with a streak of sexual ambiguity. The movie puts a glowing romantic spin on Brendan's attraction to his best friend, Charlie Millwall (Danny Dyer), a sailor who, although openly gay, is not seriously harassed. When the two exchange a kiss, it is a liberating moment unencumbered by guilt or shame. Nor does that kiss have any effect on Brendan's deepening passion for Joyce's daughter, Liz (Eva Birthistle), who returns his affection. (Behan eventually married another woman in 1955.)
