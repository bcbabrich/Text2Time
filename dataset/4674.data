P. A. Bergner & Company, the bankrupt retail company that operates the Carson Pirie Scott department stores, filed a lawsuit yesterday against Sears, Roebuck & Company and Arthur C. Martinez. The suit accuses Sears and Mr. Martinez, the new chairman of Sears's retail division, of breaking the executive's commitment to become chief executive of P. A. Bergner.

The lawsuit, filed in New York, contends that Mr. Martinez, who was until yesterday vice chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, committed himself to accepting a position as Bergner's chief executive in a deal that included a $1 million salary for three years, a $1 million signing bonus and several other perquisites.

On Aug. 10, Sears abruptly announced that Mr. Martinez would head its $31 billion retailing unit, stunning Bergner's, which had filed papers a week earlier in bankruptcy court seeking approval of a contract with Mr. Martinez.

The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages from Sears and Mr. Martinez, also says that Sears illegally interfered with Bergner's business. A spokesman for Sears said the company had not reviewed the suit and declined to comment.
