''Solomon Sheba,'' a jazz chamber opera about romance and power, was performed Sunday night at Alice Tully Hall by the Harlem Opera Society. Written by Ed Taylor and composed by Sam Rivers in 1973, and directed by Mr. Taylor, it used a jazz quartet and a cast of opera and blues-style singers to retell the biblical encounter of Solomon and Makeda, the Queen of Sheba.

It is a small-scale opera - a series of solos, duets and trios, with all its dialogue sung. Straightforwardly, in the manner of a historical pageant, it shows the courts of Solomon and of the virgin queen Makeda, who is told of Solomon's wisdom and decides to pay him a visit of state. At Solomon's court, the rulers become lovers, but then part and return to their royal duties. Supporting characters include two of Solomon's jealous wives, two members of Makeda's court and a pair of dancers.

Mr. Rivers's music takes four shapes. There are blues and blues-flavored tunes; jazzy ballads; modal incantations and recitatives and, at moments of high emotion, roiling free jazz. The quartet of Bobby Watson on saxophones and flute, Donald Smith on piano, Anthony Cox on bass and Eli Fountain on drums handled vamps, songs and improvisations with ease and spontaneity.

The score makes some motions toward operatic form - returning to the key of A minor whenever Solomon is being kingly, for instance - but does not develop themes in any dramatic way; the opera simply proceeds from number to number.
