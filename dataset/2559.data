IF a computer can have sex appeal, it is probably demonstrated most clearly in high-end gaming laptops. While young men in decades past might have lusted after the latest automotive hardware, the players (almost all young men) who gathered at a gaming party near Buffalo last month have a different passion. It made them enthusiastic road-testers of three roughly comparable laptops -- from Alienware, Dell and VoodooPC -- that a reporter asked them to size up.

Each laptop came with a DVD/CD burner, 1 gigabyte of RAM, a 60-gigabyte hard drive and built-in Wi-Fi networking capability. All were in the $3,000 vicinity.

The Dell and VoodooPC units also had Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The VoodooPC included a built-in videoconferencing camera, and the Alienware had its own remote control. The VoodooPC included the Professional version of Windows XP, while the others used the Home Edition.

Dell's unit was the fastest, but with its bulky case, it also ran the coolest. The VoodooPC was not quite as fast as the others, but its lustrous finish and elegant design attracted the most attention. The Alienware fit between the other two in both styling and speed. (The makers of Alienware and VoodooPC, in particular, pointed out that the laptops they provided were not at the top of their product lines; the best are even faster and can top $4,000.)
