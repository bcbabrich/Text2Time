Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, has waded into another Republican primary, this time endorsing Rand Paul’s Kentucky Senate campaign.

In a statement released Monday, Ms. Palin said she was “proud to support great grassroots candidates like Dr. Paul,” an ophthalmologist and son of Representative Ron Paul, the Texas Republican and 2008 presidential candidate.

“While there are issues we disagree on, he and I are both in agreement that it’s time to shake up the status quo in Washington and stand up for common sense ideas,” Ms. Palin added.

For his part, Dr. Paul on Monday touted the leadership of Ms. Palin, who is scheduled to give the keynote address at the National Tea Party Convention this week. “I will strive to capitalize on the support of Governor Palin and so many others to go to Washington and fight for liberty and limited government,” said Dr. Paul, himself a favorite among Tea Party activists.

Dr. Paul is locked in a primary battle with Trey Grayson, Kentucky’s secretary of state, in the race to succeed retiring Republican Jim Bunning. Mr. Grayson has received support from, among others, Mitch McConnell, the state’s senior senator and the Republican leader in the Senate.

Ms. Palin’s endorsement comes not long after she announced she will campaign for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Arizona Senator John McCain and Representative Michele Bachmann. Mr. Perry, who is seeking a third full term, faces Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in a high-profile primary, while Mr. McCain could face a tough challenge from the right.

The Times’s Ian Urbina took a closer look at Dr. Paul’s candidacy last November, finding that the novice candidate with a libertarian streak was “capitalizing on a hearty distrust of government and an anti-Republican-establishment fervor among conservatives” to raise a large campaign war chest, largely over the Internet.
