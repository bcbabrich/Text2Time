Congressional travel arrangements and Democratic presidential candidates both old and new played large roles on the blogs today.

Al Gore was nominated for a Nobel Peace Price for his efforts in global climate change, efforts that also have him in position to possibly win an Academy Award for his documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.” And some blogs saw these potential awards as a possible prelude to a victory of a bigger kind.

The left-leaning Daily Kos considered the possibility of the world’s first Nobel Prize winning, Oscar holding, President of the United States.

“So say Gore scores an Oscar and Nobel in the same year, he can announce in November and still become THE story in the primaries. It’s not as if he’ll need the full year to get his name recognition up or make the case for his candidacy … His passion is fighting global warming, not Social Security solvency or extracting ourselves from Bush’s myriad messes. But if the stars align properly, you never know.”

MyDD thought Gore might be taking too much time to leap into the presidential race.

The winner of the Nobel Prize “is traditionally announced in mid-October… then he can announce for President the following week? Seriously, how much time does Al Gore need to have for announcing a presidential campaign?”

The blogs also focused on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, who kicked off his run for the nomination yesterday with some widely criticized “compliments” for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.

Patrick Ruffini, writing on his self-titled blog, (even though he’s been hired on by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s nascent 2008 campaign, took another angle on the comments from the charges of insensitivity and potential racism of yesterday.

Why, the site wondered, would a politician be so effusive in praise of his competition,

“Exciting. Fresh. Smart. New. Insightful. Lightning in a jar. Six ways of saying the same thing. Excuse me Senator, but if Barack Obama is all these things, why don’t you get out of the race and endorse him now?”

And Nancy Pelosi, who the conservative blogs covered with copious doomsday posts when she became Speaker of the House, found herself under conservative criticism yet again, this time for her travel arrangements.

Responding to reports in the Washington Times that she is “pressing the Bush administration for routine access to military aircraft for domestic flights,” Suitably Flip said

“Nancy Pelosi is so bounteous with her new-found spoils that not only will she treat herself to military aircraft for all her travel needs, but so too shall her family members, her staff – heck, even fellow Congress members (so long as they hail from California) avail themselves of the on-demand military commuting service.”

Captain’s Quarters Blog, while acknowledging that J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the previous Speaker, sometimes used military transport for security reasons, said that Ms. Pelosi’s “request goes far beyond even that questionable consideration … the military is not a charter service for politicians who want to avoid using the same airports as the rest of the hoi polloi. The military has other responsibilities, especially in a time of war, and pampering Congressmen shouldn’t take precedence over them.”
