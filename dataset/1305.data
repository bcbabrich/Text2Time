Accel Partners has closed two new funds for China, totaling $1.3 billion, the company said on Friday.

One fund, valued at $550 million, will focus on young start-ups, while the second, a $750 million fund, will focus on later-stage financings. Accel, which has been active in China since 2005, has made several investments in the region with its partner IDG.

The closing of Accel’s funds, comes as several of its large peers are raising billions in funding. As DealBook was first to report on Friday, Bessemer Venture Partners raised $1.6 billion for a fund focused on early stage start-ups and India. The fund, Bessemer’s largest to date, was heavily oversubscribed, with about $2.5 billion in intended commitments, according to two people close to the firm, who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Jim Breyer, a partner at Accel, said the new funds represented Accel’s growing commitment to the market: “I spend several weeks each year in China with the team. We continue to remain very excited by the potential in China; its consumer Internet, social applications, mobile and media have remained our core focus over the last six years.”

In 2010, Accel had nine exits in China, including five initial public offerings, Mr. Breyer said.
