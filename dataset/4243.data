A two-year study of fast-food-restaurant employees in Harlem and Oakland, Calif., has found that young people from the inner city benefit substantially from the work, despite the low wages, but there usually is no "next tier" of employment to which they can climb by using the skills they have learned or honed in the restaurants.

This absence of employment at the next step up, according to two professors of anthropology who conducted the study, makes it extremely difficult for the inner-city youngsters, who are not well educated, to work their way out of poverty.

The kids have mixed feelings," said Prof. Katherine Newman of Columbia University, who studied the Harlem workers. "They feel that if they work hard at this it will lead somewhere. But their experience is that it doesn't."

The point of the study was to look closely at the lives of the working poor at a time when much of the attention of government and the media is focused on poor people who are not working. Professor Newman and her colleague, Prof. Carol Stack of the University of California at Berkeley, who did the Oakland study, said the fast-food workers were representative of the majority of the urban poor -- men and women who are working at jobs that even on a full-time basis do not pay enough to adequately support a family.
