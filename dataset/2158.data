For buildings with hot-water heating systems, it is possible to make adjustments by using an "outdoor reset control." With such a device, Mr. Gifford said, the temperature of the water coursing through the building can be adjusted up or down in response to the outdoor temperature.

"It's like a dimmer switch for the heating system," he said.

He explained that while hot water systems without a reset control are either "all on" during the heating cycle or "all off" between cycles, systems that use the device always have hot water running through the pipes, but they vary the temperature of that water according to the outdoor temperature. As a result, Mr. Gifford said, the system produces just the amount of heat the building needs at a given moment, and does so more evenly.

Steam systems have even more noticeable peaks and valleys of heat and cold because they are always either "all on" or "all off" and because it is generally not possible to vary the temperature of steam.

One way for building owners or managers to balance temperatures in steam-heated buildings, Mr. Gifford said, is to install a thermostat on each radiator.

"Thermostatic radiator valves use no electricity, are easy to install and cost from $40 to $50 each," he said, explaining that the valves have a sensor that opens and closes the radiator in response to the temperature in the room.

In buildings with two-pipe steam heating systems - basically older buildings with seven or more floors - these valves replace the on-off valve on the radiator. In one-pipe steam systems - usually found in buildings less than seven stories high - a thermostatic valve can replace the air vent.

"It doesn't shut off the radiator completely, but it can reduce the heat output," Mr. Gifford said.

Edward Winiarski, president of Optimum Applied Systems in Hawthorne, N.Y., said his company's Heat Computer system provides another way of controlling heat in large buildings. Internal temperatures in a building are monitored with remote sensors - wired or wireless - that are installed in a select number of apartments. Once temperatures in a majority of these apartments reach a preset level, the computer turns off the heat.

The system, which costs from $3,000 for a basic model to $10,000 for a unit with 18 sensors, is guaranteed to produce savings of at least 15 percent over the course of the heating season, according to Mr. Winiarski.
