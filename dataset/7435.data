BONN, April 30—An assize court in Bochum today sentenced the former SS (Elite Guard) administrator of the ghetto in Tarnow, Poland, to hard labor for life after having convicted him on 22 counts of murder and complicity in the murder of at least 4.000 Jews.

The former Nazi, 63‐year‐old Hermann Blache, had been indicted for the murder of more than 100 of the ghetto's inhabitants, including the trampling of several children to death. He was also accused of having ordered his 16‐year‐old son to shoot Jews for ”exercise.“
