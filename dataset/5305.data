American Samoa's delegate to the House of Representatives and his administrative assistant conspired to defraud the Government of more than $130,000 and will plead guilty of the offense, the United States Attorney's office has announced.

A document prosecutors filed Wednesday in the Federal District Court after a plea agreement was reached with the two defendants said the delegate, Fofo I. F. Sunia, and his aide had acquired the money by putting ghost employees on their Congressional payroll. The money was then used, the papers said, to entertain constituents, pay election campaign expenses and make house and car loan payments.

The document said that from February 1983 to August 1986, Mr. Sunia and his assistant, Matthew K. Iuli, falsely certified to the House finance office that people who were actually living in American Samoa and elsewhere were employed in Mr. Sunia's Congressional office in Washington. Ghost Employees Unaware

The ghost employees were not even aware that they were listed as Congressional employees, said the office of the United States Attorney, Jay Stephens.
