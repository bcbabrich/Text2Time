Bookstores, new and used, abound -- including one of Northern California's great independent bookstores and a local cultural landmark, Book Shop Santa Cruz. Such literary demand hints at another, less obvious Santa Cruz identity -- as a true university town. The population of about 55,000 includes some 11,000 students who attend the University of California Santa Cruz, known as the most offbeat of the U.C. branches (their mascot is the banana slug).

One afternoon we stationed ourselves at the Chocolate Bistro, a sidewalk cafe near the entrance to Book Shop Santa Cruz, and took in the parade of hippies, yuppies, punks, students, street musicians, Hare Krishnas and police officers in shorts riding their mountain bikes. There always seemed to be at least one person playing the drums. (Now, though, there is a proposed city ordinance that, if passed, will make panhandling all but impossible after mid-October.)

The scene was lively, too, for Sunday brunch at Zachary's, deservedly the most popular breakfast spot for dishes like sourdough pancakes. Our first night, we lucked out with a last-minute dinner reservation at Oswald -- a snug bistro recommended by every local resident we asked. The food was heavenly -- from a silky squid-ink risotto topped with Monterey Bay calamari to a dark chocolate souffl√© served with a tiny pitcher of heavy cream -- but the ambience was casual, right down to our blond surfer waiter.

Surfers and their culture are ubiquitous. One of their landmarks is O'Neill's, the Pacific Avenue shop owned by Jack O'Neill, a 40-year resident who invented the surfing wet suit (no doubt inspired by the chilly Northern California waters). Outside, old VW vans with surfboards strapped to the roofs ride Pacific Avenue straight down to the beach.

One of the world's great surfing breaks, Steamer Lane, is off the sandstone cliffs of Lighthouse Point, about a mile and a half up the coast from the Boardwalk. Unlike many such breaks, it's easily seen from the coast, as is Seal Rock, a tiny island strewn with glossy black sea lions and harbor seals.

The Point's little brick lighthouse has been converted into the Surfing Museum, a snug space crammed with displays detailing surfing moves like aerials and floaters, and the exploits of the two Hawaiian princes who introduced surfing to Santa Cruz in 1885. An enormous, 10-foot redwood longboard from the 1930's vies for attention with a modern polyurethane board riddled with shark bites.

But we soon joined the crowd that had gathered, transfixed, around a television set playing the 2001 surfing documentary ''Whipped!'' It includes stunning footage of a season at Mavericks, the legendary big wave break point 60 miles up the coast and a mile from land. Surfers there ride -- and risk getting crushed by -- waves as high as 80 feet.
