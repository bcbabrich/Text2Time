PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 2—Idle Dice made his task look easy tonight when he won the first open jumper class in a jumpoff at the start of the six‐day Philadelphia Horse Show at the Spectrum.

Owned by Harry Gill and ridden by Rodney Jenkins, the aged brown gelding—the top money‐winning jumper in horse‐show history — defeated five rivals for the blue ribbon.

Idle Dice, Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Butler's Old English, handled by Conrad Homfeld, and High Hopes Farm's Sun Dancer, piloted by Michele McEvoy, were all faultless in the jumpoff.

But Idle Dice, who will join the United States equestrian team in three weeks for the first time, was clocked in 35.002 seconds to 35.849 for Sun Dancer and 44.570 for Old English.
