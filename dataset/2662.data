"Boxing is broken, no doubt about it," Burnett said by telephone last week. "But if I'm right, and based on my other unscripted dramas, I can take 16 young men, and each of them will leave the contest way ahead of where they came in, in terms of their value to themselves and to us. We know that marketing is the key to their economic success."

Despite the wall of silence, some results have leaked, and many of the boxers' names are known: Sergio Mora (who has a 12-0 record), Peter Manfredo Jr. (21-0), Jesse Lee Brinkley (23-1-0) and Ishe Smith (14-0).

Mark L. Tuft, a lawyer in San Francisco who specializes in the media, said there was no problem in a person agreeing to waive what would be grounds for defamation or invasion-of-privacy claims. "But what are the outer reaches of this?" he said. "I suppose there is a line beyond which it becomes unconscionable."

Burnett defended his practices and suggested that if some of his famous alumni, like Richard Hatch of "Survivor" and Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth of "The Apprentice," were willing to suspend their civil rights for money and fame, so should the boxers. He said that the boxers had representatives read the contracts with oversight by the California State Athletic Commission.

"You can't value the boxers' rights over Richard's or Omarosa's," Burnett said. "Based on the state of boxing, and the value of these men, all of whom came in disenfranchised, pushed aside and lied to, we've kept our word and gave them a fair chance."

The boxers were unavailable for comment.

The California commission has no purview over the participant deals and did not examine them, said Dean Lohuis, the interim executive officer of the agency. "Our job is to look out for the safety of the fighters and to be sure they were ready," he said, adding that the commission kept strict oversight of the bouts.

The agreement by the boxers to abide by reality TV rules that do not exist in their normal lives would be useless to Burnett if viewers knew the results of the bouts, which have been taped, except for the final; it will be carried live in April from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
