Three years after a pregnant Carol Stuart was murdered, apparently by her husband, Charles, who the police believe committed suicide soon afterward, Mr. Stuart's brother is scheduled to go on trial Monday for his role in the crime.

Matthew Stuart, 26 years old, has not been charged as an accomplice to the murder. He is accused of conspiring with his brother to commit life insurance fraud, a scheme that prosecutors say led to Mrs. Stuart's slaying. He is also charged with related crimes.

But Mr. Stuart's lawyer, Nancy Gertner, has argued in pretrial hearings that her client is really being tried "for the sins of his brother." And she has charged that the prosecution of Mr. Stuart is largely political, that it is intended to make up for bungling by the police and the Suffolk County District Attorney's office in the initial investigation.

Based on Charles Stuart's account of the crime, the police named a black man as a suspect, stirring racial tension. Mrs. Stuart was shot and her husband badly wounded shortly after the couple left a child birthing class on Oct. 23, 1989. Mr. Stuart said a black man had committed the crime. A tape of the wounded Mr. Stuart calling for help over his car telephone was later rebroadast on national television.
