Federal regulators today approved plans for trading futures contracts tied to health-care and homeowner insurance risks.

The Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's largest futures exchange, said it expected to begin trading the unusual futures contracts in September.

As expected, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the futures industry, unanimously approved the Board of Trade's proposal.

Buying and selling the new home-owner insurance contracts would enable insurers to protect themselves against big financial losses from disasters like a hurricane or a major fire.
