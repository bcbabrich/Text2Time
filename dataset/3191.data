With only a week to go before trade ministers are scheduled to gather in Doha, Qatar, to try to set the agenda for a worldwide trade accord, actions the United States has taken since the terrorist attacks appear to have widened the gap between rich and poor nations and persuaded some negotiators that the meeting could become a casualty of war.

The Bush administration's tussle with Bayer A.G. -- in which Washington forced the company to sharply reduce the price of its anthrax drug Cipro -- has emboldened developing countries to insist on a broad ''public health'' exception to international patent rules for other drugs, like those used to keep AIDS victims alive.

India, Nigeria and many others are also arguing that if the United States can cede special trading rights to Pakistan's textile and apparel makers to help a frontline ally, it should ease barriers for clothing makers in all poor countries.

Disputes over patent rules and textile quotas have been around for years. But the exigencies of fighting terrorism have cast the matter into stark relief and set off a heated debate in Geneva, where negotiators for 142 nations in the World Trade Organization had hoped to be narrowing their differences ahead of the meeting.
