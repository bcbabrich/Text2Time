Prices farmers got for raw products in March, on the average, were unchanged from a revised February index and also a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.

The report said higher prices for lettuce, cotton, cattle and tomatoes were offset by lower prices for milk, hogs, strawberries, eggs and sweet corn, which held the preliminary March reading at the revised February average.

Food grains and livestock feed grains, and oilseeds showed little change during the month, the report said. Corn and wheat were down one cent a bushel each, while soybean prices were unchanged.

''The all-beef cattle price has continued to increase since January,'' the report said. ''Calves were at the highest price level since November 1980. Hog prices dropped after showing small gains in February.''
