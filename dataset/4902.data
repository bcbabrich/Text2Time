A woman with a passion for clipping coupons and proof-of-purchase seals has been convicted of dealing in counterfeit coupons in a $2 million scheme.

A Federal jury deliberated five days before reaching its verdict Tuesday against the 34-year-old defendant, Connie Arvidson of Boca Raton, Fla. Mrs. Arvidson was convicted of one count of conspiracy and two of mail fraud.

She could receive up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines at sentencing on March 23.

A second defendant, David Rees of Center Point, was found guilty of conspiracy. A third defendant, James Floyd Richards, of San Antonio, was found not guilty on all charges.

Judge Sidney Fitzwater of Federal District Court set bond for Mrs. Arvidson at $10,000, pending sentencing. Mr. Rees was freed on his own recognizance.
