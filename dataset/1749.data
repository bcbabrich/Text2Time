The 1960s will continue through at least 2010: to the surprise of absolutely no one, “Mad Men,” the hit AMC period drama about a New York advertising agency, has been picked up for a fourth season, the cable channel said Tuesday in a news release. The show, which has been the cornerstone of AMC’s gradually expanding lineup of original programming, won the Emmy Award for dramatic series the year after its premiere in 2007, and it is nominated for 16 more Emmys this month, including outstanding drama. In August the debut episode of its third season was the highest rated “Mad Men” broadcast to date, drawing 2.8 million viewers. A premiere date for the fourth season was not announced.
