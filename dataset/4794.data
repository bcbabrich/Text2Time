SYLVESTER STALLONE's 23-acre horse ranch, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles, is for sale for $6.75 million. Mr. Stallone is not alone in trying to sell property. PIA ZADORA is asking $5 million cash for her house in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, which she no longer needs because she and her husband, the deal-maker MESHULAM RIKLIS, bought Pickfair, which they then razed to rebuild. ZSA ZSA GABORis asking $15 million for her Bel Air mansion, bought from the estate of Howard Hughes. The asking price for Lucille Ball's house, on the market since she died in April 1989, has dropped to $4.25 million from $7.8 million.

"The market has been very bad," said MIKE SILVERMAN, the broker who handles the homes of many celebrities, including the Stallone ranch. But he has just rented his own house in Malibu, Calif., for two months to DOUGLAS WICK, the producer, for $1,000 a day.
