These were supposed to be the golden years for Robert Campbell, a chance to spend lazy afternoons with his wife, pursue his passion for gospel music and develop the bus company he had started as a hobby and a community service into a successful business.

It was supposed to be a time when Mr. Campbell would show that hard work and Christian values could allow someone to rise above the filth and crime that had crept into his neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, over the last 10 years.

Now, only two months after Mr. Campbell retired from his maintenance job of 25 years, those dreams have been shattered. Last Sunday, the bus he was driving to a New Jersey amusement park crashed and burned, leaving six people dead. Among them was his wife of more than three decades, Allie Mae, 57 years old.

Yesterday, he was charged with six counts of aggravated manslaughter because, a New Jersey prosecutor said, he knew the bus had faulty brakes when he left for Action Park.
