That announcement followed shortly after the demise of 1stUp, a Spinway competitor owned by CMGI, the Net holding company. 1stUp, based in San Francisco, was the technology behind free service from Alta Vista and Excite@Home's FreeLane, along with dozens of smaller niche services, like Gay .com, Senior.com and Afronet.com. Shortly after 1stUp's announcement, Alta Vista said that it was canceling its free service; other 1stUp partners are still hoping to find a home someplace else.

Back in July, Juno gobbled up two competitors, Freewwweb and WorldSpy, both of which declared bankruptcy and then began referring subscribers to Juno's site.

That leaves NetZero and Juno still standing as the industry leaders, each with 3.7 million active users, along with a handful of miscellaneous Web retailers still hoping that sales of merchandise will make up for their free Internet services. But even the two remaining major free providers are walking on rather thin ice these days: like many Internet stocks, shares of both Juno and NetZero, which are embroiled in patent lawsuits against each other over the way ads are displayed on computer screens, have been pummeled in recent weeks. Shares of Juno, which traded at $41.63 in January, closed under a dollar last week. NetZero was also under a dollar, down from a 52-week high of $36.38.

Yet rather than disappear entirely, analysts predict that free I.S.P. services are likely to continue in some form, for those customers who do not overuse them. Many analysts say that tiered pricing programs like those announced by Juno and NetZero are the future, and the challenge now is to convert users of the free service into paying customers.

Not that long ago, Internet customers bought service by the minute, much like long-distance telephone service -- for upward of $100 a month for active users. But by the late 1990's, most Internet providers in the United States had modified their business models, switching to flat monthly fees in an effort to gain more revenue from advertisers and electronic commerce and less from subscriptions. It appeared for some players that eliminating the subscription fee altogether was simply the next step. Adding it back now appears to be yet another one.

But it could be that major fee-based services like America Online, the Microsoft Network and CompuServe will end up as biggest beneficiaries of the free-I.S.P. shakeout. All three already offer tiered service, with limited plans priced as low as at $9.95. As more active users are removed from free services, analysts say, they may migrate to those more established names rather than pay the amount to a relative newcomer who might not offer the same level of service.

NetZero, however, has considerable brand recognition these days, the result of an advertising blitz that includes television spots during N.B.A. games, and the company's chairman and chief executive, Mark R. Goldston, says the company is signing up new subscribers at a record pace.
