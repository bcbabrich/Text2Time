''It's either they've been the life of the party or the class clown, and they haven't gotten it out of their blood,'' he said. ''So when they hit 35 or 45, people say, 'You know, I never really wanted to be a doctor.' ''

TAKE Dale Mathias. (Please.) ''In the back of my mind, I always saw a picture of myself on stage with a mike in my hand and people laughing at me,'' she said. In real life, she graduated from college at 20 and spent the next 23 years as a corporate executive, ending up general manager of an industrial chemical company in New Jersey. ''I didn't care about the money,'' she said. ''I didn't care about the security. I was miserable. Miserable!''

So she quit. At 46, she's a waitress at Rascals, trying to make it as stand-up comic with a routine partly about life as a middle-aged single woman. ''I'm down here in Florida visiting my mother,'' she said by telephone. ''As you can imagine, I have plenty of new ammo. I have to keep excusing myself to go to the bathroom to write down something else my mother said that was hilarious.''

Not all the late-blooming comics quit their day jobs. David Moore, 44, an investor and the owner of a home remodeling business, was in his office in Fort Lee, N.J., late Monday night negotiating the sale of one of his companies. Between conference calls with venture capitalists he changed into his jeans and barely made it to Carolines on Broadway in Manhattan for his 8:30 gig. ''For me,'' he said of comedy, ''it's like an out-of-body experience.''

For Doug Karpf it's an out-of-uniform experience. A northern New Jersey police officer, he's worked tough rooms where the only sound was muffled coughs and foreheads hitting Formica-topped tables. But in his fledgling career, the 30-year-old officer has also had some nights when, as he put it, he was ''killing 'em.''

It's hooked him. ''I can't explain to you what it's like to have 100 people in the audience laughing and it's because of you.'' He now has three missions: to serve and protect, and to humor.
