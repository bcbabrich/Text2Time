The Bush administration today urged the Supreme Court to reject a request by the Microsoft Corporation to consider throwing out the findings that the company had repeatedly abused its monopoly in the software industry.

In an appeal viewed by experts as a long shot, Microsoft has asked the justices to vacate the decision that the company repeatedly violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The company's sole basis for its appeal is the finding by an appeals court here that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson violated a Federal ethics law by discussing the case with reporters.

The company has maintained that a complete dismissal of Judge Jackson's findings is the only way to restore the public's confidence in an impartial judicial system. Microsoft lawyers have denied accusations by critics that its appeal to the Supreme Court is a frivolous attempt to delay the case and blunt its impact on a new operating system, Windows XP, which will begin appearing in new computers in September.

Since the Supreme Court typically hears cases that either involve constitutional questions or conflicting opinions among different jurisdictions, appellate specialists say there is little chance that Microsoft will find the four votes necessary to grant a review of its case now. In the case, the decision was unanimously approved by seven judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court addressed an ethics question in which the Supreme Court has given wide discretion to the lower courts.
