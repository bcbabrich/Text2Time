Japanese officials moved closer today to stating that the Government would agree to a slight opening of Japan's rice market if that was necessary to conclude a new global trade treaty.

The Chief Cabinet Secretary, Koichi Kato, said at a news conference today that Japan might eventually make a "political decision" to make a concession so as not to jeopardize the current round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

The statement was one of the strongest indications to date that the Government was ready to reverse its official stance of trying to maintain a ban on imported rice.

Meanwhile, Asahi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper, reported this morning that the Government had already essentially decided to remove the prohibition on rice imports. The newspaper said the Government had found it impossible to persuade other nations to allow Japan to maintain its closed market, which Japan has argued is necessary to assure self-sufficiency in its staple food.
