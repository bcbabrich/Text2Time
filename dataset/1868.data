We had a nice event at Princeton yesterday — the Graham lecture, given this year by Jon Eaton — and later, over drinks, Jim Harrigan pointed me to an interesting paper by David Hummels and co-authors about international transportation. The interesting point is that for many countries/routes, there isn’t a lot of competition: modern ships are big, and many countries are small.

Minimum efficient scale in shipping is significant. The capacity of a modern container ship is large relative to the export volumes produced by smaller countries, and there are substantial economies of scope in offering transport services over a network of ports. One way to see this effect is to calculate the number of carriers operating on a particular trade route. In the fourth quarter 2006 one in six importer-exporter pairs world-wide was served by a single direct liner “service”, meaning that only one ship was operating on that route. Over half of importer-exporter pairs were served by three or fewer ships, and in many cases all of the ships on a route were owned by a single carrier

I know, it’s not world-shaking, but I always think it’s interesting to get a sense of the physical reality of trade, which is a lot less seamless than we tend to think.
