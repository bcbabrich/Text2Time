Chief Justice William Rehnquist said today that the 25 percent raise for Federal judges that becomes effective on Tuesday would help them cope with a sharply rising caseload of drug crimes and bankruptcies.

By providing the raise, Congress "averted a crisis in the judiciary by fairly addressing what had been one of the most important issues affecting our branch in the late '80's," the Chief Justice said in his year-end report on the Federal court system.

In testifying before Congress in 1989, Chief Justice Rehnquist had urged large raises for all Federal judges. He called judges' salaries at that time inadequate and said they would cause "more resignations from the bench, more damage to the morale of those judges who remain and more difficulty in recruiting new judges."

In his report, the Chief Justice said that the Federal courts' budget for the current fiscal year had topped $2 billion for the first time and that the growing Federal caseload, "fueled by drug cases and an ever-rising tide of personal bankruptcies," was sure to require even greater spending.
