The Daisy Systems Corporation began a tender offer at $8 a share in cash to acquire control of the Cadnetix Corporation. Daisy, a maker of computer-aided engineering systems, based in Mountain View, Calif., already holds 7.6 percent of Cadnetix, a Boulder. Colo., company that makes similar systems. Daisy's offer is for 11.7 million shares, which would give it 51 percent of Cadnetix.

Daisy said it was willing to amend the offer to purchase all of Cadnetix's outstanding shares of common stock at $8 a share in cash if Cadnetix's board supported the deal. Daisy said the offer follows attempts last spring and again this week to discuss a possible merger with Cadnetix.

Norman Friedman, Daisy's president and chief executive, said in a statement that Cadnetix's strength in computer-aided design systems for printed circuit board development would fit well with Daisy's strength in integrated circuit design and system simulation.
