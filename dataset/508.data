How these directors reach Hollywood can be decidedly more modern than the paths earlier generations traveled. The Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez came to Hollywood’s attention through a 2009 short film that went viral, “Panic Attack,” a resourceful imagining of an alien invasion of Montevideo. Hollywood agencies, studios and managers started calling the day after it was posted, and Mr. Alvarez was soon on a plane to Los Angeles. He went on to direct the 2013 remake of Sam Raimi’s scrappy 1981 classic, “The Evil Dead.”

“I always joke about the fact that when I go in and pitch something with some accent,” Mr. Alvarez said by phone, “it just makes the whole thing sound more interesting.”

His new film, “Don’t Breathe,” which opened Aug. 26, follows three teenage burglars in Detroit who meet their match in a blind veteran. Mr. Alvarez is next set to direct “Monsterpocalypse,” an adaptation of a board game. But Mr. Alvarez, 38, attributes his success to developing his skills far from Hollywood. He started shooting shorts at 7, studied screenwriting in Amsterdam and established a postproduction house in Uruguay before making the leap.

“I was working so long in such an isolated place,” Mr. Alvarez said. “That way, by the time Hollywood finds you, you’re so prepared. When they find other filmmakers at an earlier moment in their careers, they’re not so prepared — and then that becomes their chance, and then it never happens again.”
