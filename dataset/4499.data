DRESSED in jeans, a black jacket and recycled shoes, Martina Navratilova floated up the escalator into the hot, white light of the television cameras, some kind of blond, casual goddess rising from the sea.

Smiling but moving as fast as one of her groundstrokes, she blistered through the tony, largely gay crowd waiting breathlessly to see her in the upper reaches of Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night. A few mumbled hellos and she was gone, tucked safely away inside one of those rooms reserved for stars like her at times like these.

It seemed her miniature fox terrier, K.D. (Killer Dog) had become agitated by all the lights and noise and people gathered at the Paramount for A Lesbian and Gay Tribute to Martina, a fund-raising event sponsored by the Gay Games IV and Cultural Festival, an Olympic-style sporting and cultural event that will be held around New York City next June. This was announced by Ms. Navratilova's handlers-for-the-night, identified by the I'm-Very-Serious looks they wore chiseled on their faces. Ms. Navratilova also needed a moment to recover from the crush.

THE photographers grumbled. Some people who had paid money to be there grumbled. But Marge Sherwin did not grumble. She trembled. After years of admiring Ms. Navratilova as much for her honesty about being a lesbian as for her tennis game, and after a hellish two-and-a-half-hour commute from her home on the East End of Long Island to attend this tribute, Marge Sherwin had found herself and her camera right in Ms. Navratilova's path.
