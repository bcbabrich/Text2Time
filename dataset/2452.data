IT is something of a Fashion Week tradition to gauge which newcomer will generate the most buzz, which up-and-coming designer will whet the appetite of retailers with the presentation of mere sketches. For the New York shows, which begin Sept. 8, a leading contender is Brian Reyes, a designer who held jobs for Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors and Oscar de la Renta before branching out on his own at the age of 24.

The pattern of previous designers who became prominent in American fashion within a matter of seasons -- people like Zac Posen, Derek Lam, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler -- was certainly on Mr. Reyes's mind when he decided to create his own collection for spring 2006. But Mr. Reyes has a history of precocious behavior.

As a teenager in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., he befriended several stylists and assisted them on fashion shoots in Miami. By 19 he had saved enough money working at a Coach store to move to New York, having persuaded the company to let him work at its Madison Avenue location. After less than a month in the city he got his first design job at Polo Ralph Lauren, where he made clothes for boys.

"They only found out later I was 19," said Mr. Reyes, who went on to become the men's collection designer for Mr. Kors in 2001 and joined Mr. de la Renta's design studio in 2004.
