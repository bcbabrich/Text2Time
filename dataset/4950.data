The Francis Bacon exhibition that opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art comprises 59 paintings. Most of them are large, and some are made up of two or three canvases, each measuring 78 by 58 inches. They cover the years from 1945 to 1988. (Bacon was 80 years old last October.) Many of the images in the show acquired classic status long ago and have been regarded by enthusiasts as central to the concerns of our day. This was already true when Bacon was believed, as the critic Sam Hunter writes in the catalogue, to have echoed the ''paralyzing, affectless settings of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'No Exit' of 1942 and Samuel Beckett's 'Endgame' of 1957.'' And to this day, in a sustained tracking shot that has been going for half a century, Bacon seems to have prefigured many of the images that look out at us every day in the news pages and on the television news.

We see men discarded like rotting meat. Behind what is presumably bulletproof glass, we see other men preaching, talking, hallooing, ranting, raving or prey to manic, uncontrollable laughter. (The primal human cry, King Lear's ''Howl, howl, howl!,'' is a lifelong obsession with Bacon, though we should not forget what he said in 1962 to his friend, the critic David Sylvester: that often as he had painted the primal cry, he had always wanted to paint the primal smile but had never succeeded in doing it.) In the Bacons that everyone talks about, we see violence taken for granted, and the bloodied messes that result from it. Voyeur and victim are set before us in ways that suggest they may soon change places. Second-rank and second-rate people stand around, just as they do in life, to see what will come of it all.

In the windowless echo chamber that Bacon knew so well how to evoke, (as in ''Study for a Portrait,'' 1953), we see an archetypal C.E.O. revert to babyhood in his single hotel room. We see prefigured the hideous ordinariness of Adolf Eichmann, on trial in Jerusalem. Bacon could also (as in ''Fragment for a Crucifixion,'' from 1950) give a new and sinister meaning to the phrase ''dog eat dog.''

These are one-shot images, and most of them date from 40 years ago, but they still pack a formidable punch. Those who have grown up and grown old with them would have trouble imagining a world in which they had played no part. They are by now a permanent part of the furniture of the European imagination, and the paintings as we see them in the Museum of Modern Art come over again and again as grand formal statements in which order and clarity have long ago won out over disquiet.
