Several people who said they were against the decision to invade Iraq admitted to being somewhat more supportive of the effort after hearing of exhilaration and hopefulness at the Iraqi polls. Derreset Brown, a homebuilder from Conley, Ga., said that he remained opposed to the war but that the elections had helped him understand the other side.

"Before, I thought it was time for us to get out," Mr. Brown, 40, said. "Now I can see it as a reason to stay. I'm a little more understanding."

And Barbara Hollek, a musician in Chicago who said she had always regretted the Bush administration's actions in Iraq, said the bravery of Iraqi voters and the high turnout had given her a new perspective.

"That in itself does say something, that more people there are more satisfied with what we've done," Ms. Hollek, 51, said of the turnout, though she added that she was "not yet" ready to change her mind about the war. "There's still a long way to go to prove anything because a lot more lives, I'm sure, will be lost on all sides."

Many of those interviewed said their main reaction was awe for the millions of Iraqis who voted despite intimidation and threats of injury or death. Some said it was a crucial reminder for Americans who took their right to vote for granted.

"I get goose bumps," said Ligia Guevara, 44, a homemaker in Weston, Fla. "I am so proud of them that they are going out knowing that their lives are at stake."

Joyce Goodwin, 75, a Seattle resident visiting Laguna Beach, Calif., echoed that sentiment. Ms. Goodwin said she had expected a lot of violence, adding, "We would be intimidated ourselves if someone was threatening to harm us or our families for voting, don't you think?"
