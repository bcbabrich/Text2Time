There are logical reasons why composers are regularly honored with centenary (and multi-centenary) tributes, but performers' centenaries are rarely celebrated. A composer's work, after all, takes on a life independent of its creator; a performer's art is personal expression. Without the performer on hand, what is there?

Carnegie Hall wrestled with this question on Thursday evening in a tribute to Marian Anderson, who would have been 100 years old on Feb. 17. The concert was part of a larger tribute that includes an exhibition of memorabilia from her career in the hall's Rose Museum and a teachers' workshop that was held last weekend.

Anderson's career had a special dimension, of course: it was inextricably linked to a historical current, the struggle for civil rights in the first half of this century. She was often described as a reluctant symbol, and one can appreciate that: her triumphant 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial, after all, came after being banned from Constitution Hall. The entire episode was itself a symbol of Anderson's ability to prevail over countless other humiliations.

But a powerful and lasting symbol it was, and it became a leitmotif on Thursday, when several of Anderson's colleagues offered both personal anecdotes and stories with a broader historical sweep between performances of works associated with her. Isaac Stern began with a celebratory overview, and Rita Dove, the poet, spoke of Anderson's influence on her. It seemed, early on, as if hagiography would overwhelm music as a focus of the evening, something I suspect Anderson would have regretted.
