For much of its 67-year history, The New Yorker has seemed to float in splendid isolation, a law unto itself, unruffled by the turbulence that disturbs lesser magazines.

The last decade has changed all that.

The announcement that Tina Brown, the editor in chief of Vanity Fair, will replace Robert A. Gottlieb as editor of The New Yorker means the magazine will have its second new editor in five years. The changes in editorship represent a dramatic increase in the metabolic rate of a magazine whose first two editors, Harold W. Ross and William Shawn, presided for more than half a century.

Mr. Shawn, a managing editor who took over the top spot when Mr. Ross died in 1951, after in effect having run the show for two years, edited the magazine for so long that an entire generation of readers grew up with no memory of the Ross New Yorker, a quite different magazine than the one Mr. Gottlieb inherited from Mr. Shawn. From Bite to Whimsy

In its original form, The New Yorker was a brilliant, unpredictable product of the Jazz Age, irreverent, brisk, gossipy and sharp. The provocative tone was set by contributors like Dorothy Parker, Wolcott Gibbs, Robert Benchley and James Thurber, and later by S. J. Perelman and A. J. Liebling.
