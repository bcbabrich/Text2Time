Fifteen years ago, the miners here tried to form a collective, pooling their money and labor. They accumulated a cache of nearly 900 pounds of amber, and planned to set up their own store. But bandits stole the whole load, and the cooperative collapsed in bitterness.

The question of who owns the earth that the miners work is vexing. Some land is held in common, some is privately owned and land rights often set off fierce fights. Some of the miners are freelancers, some have to rent their mines from land owners. The least fortunate live down in the mouths of the mines.

It is not a long life. There are no mine-workers' unions here, no safety standards, no rules or regulations, no hard hats or flashlights. There is only work.

Genaro Bonifaz Diaz, 40, has been down in the mines since he was a child. He has seen friends die quickly in tunnels crushed by mudslides, and die slowly as their lungs collapsed from the fine dust that flies with every hammer blow. ''We suffer, but we have to support our families,'' he said from underground.

''Thank God, I haven't been trapped,'' he said. ''But when it's raining, the roof can cave in, and two of my buddies have died'' in recent months. ''Many of us have gotten sick in the lungs. These candles, the smoke is terrible for you. But we don't have anything else.''

As he pounded and hacked at the black wall before him, a boy of 14, José Florentine Hernández Sanchez, stood watching, picking up the technique. José has worked in the mines off and on since he was 10 to pay for clothes and school supplies.

''It scared me, the first time I entered,'' he said, ''because I thought something bad might happen.''
