George Bush begins the new year with his Presidency poised between success and failure. The country begins it with bated breath.

Should the crisis in the Middle East turn into a blood bath, or become the kind of prolonged stalemate that Mr. Bush has promised to avoid, it could prove as damaging to him as Vietnam proved to Lyndon B. Johnson. If weeks or months of heavy American casualties would hurt, so would further disruption of oil supplies, which would force up gasoline prices and damage the already weak economy.

Like Lyndon Johnson, President Bush could find it devilishly hard to deliver either of the two things that matter most to the American electorate -- peace and prosperity. That's why the next few months, in the plain words of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, look like "make or break time for George Bush."

The prospect of another crippled President, one would think, would cast a pall over Washington, to say nothing of the prospect of war. But no real anxiety grips the capital. In fact, the most notable things about the city as the final hours of 1990 slipped by were empty sidewalks, silent telephones and offices vacated hours before quitting time.
