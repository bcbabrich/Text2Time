The ironies of "Exist: Not a Protest Film" begin with the title. This is a protest film insofar as it addresses a subject all but ignored by mainstream culture: the personal and political struggles of young radical activists. By dramatizing their lives with candor, sympathy and a healthy strain of skepticism, the director, Esther Bell, offers an antidote to the whimsy and solipsism endemic to much of what passes for independent filmmaking.

Nic Mevoli stars as Top, organizer of a Philadelphia squatter community devoted to left-wing causes. The group is scattered after a routine raid ends with the wounding of a police officer, an accident for which, of course, the black kid is blamed. This is Jake (Ben Bartlett), a privileged Harvard dropout whose radical rhetoric strikes Top as disingenuous. Things change with everyone on the lam, and ironies proliferate as "Exist" tracks the dovetailing destinies of these two young idealists (both of whom are nicely underplayed by "actorvists," Ms. Bell's term for her nonprofessional players).

If the oppositional sensibility of the movie belies one aspect of the title, it is correct in another sense. Properly speaking, "Exist" is not a protest film but a protest video -- the grass-roots medium of choice -- and Ms. Bell makes good use of the technology. Mock interviews reinforce a strong documentary impulse, while digital blurs and layering further distance the material from status quo moviemaking.
