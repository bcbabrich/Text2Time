Over its 23-year history, the Harlem Urban Development Corporation received almost $100 million in state funds to help rebuild Harlem. Millions of dollars were spent on lawyers, hundreds of thousands went for telephone calls around the world and perks like cellular phones and cars, and hundreds of thousands more are still unaccounted for.

And when the agency was dissolved two years ago, state officials say, it had not produced a single major commercial project.

Internal audits released yesterday by the Pataki administration portray an agency with few controls, where state money sloshed freely with little regard for contracting procedures or documentation. One lawyer who had a contract for $28,750 wound up being paid $171,591. Some employees were classified as ''consultants'' by the corporation, which failed to withhold as much as $1.5 million in state and Federal taxes from their paychecks.

The revelations of the inner workings of the development corporation, which for a generation was the prime hope for re-development in Harlem, has prompted a criminal investigation, an official in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said yesterday. The State Commission of Investigation is also examining the agency's activities.
