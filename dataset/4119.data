The night before George Bush turned over the White House to Bill Clinton he made a deal with the National Archives that gave him control over his Administration's computerized records. That deal, made in the teeth of a law declaring that all official records are public property, was smelly on its face. It looked even worse when Don Wilson, head of the National Archives, was hired as director of the George Bush Center at Texas A & M University.

Now Federal Judge Charles Richey in Washington has ruled, correctly, that Mr. Bush had no legal right to those records and that Archives had no right to surrender control, either.

At issue is the preservation of 5,000 magnetic tapes, more than 140 hard drives and one floppy disk that were whisked out of the White House on the eve of President Clinton's inauguration. Mr. Bush and Mr. Wilson agreed in writing that Archives was to dispose of the electronic records thereafter according to the wishes of George Bush, private citizen.

Judge Richey canceled this sweetheart deal. He called it a direct violation of a law specifically enacted to prevent such transactions, and a breach of the principle that "no one, not even a President, is above the law."
