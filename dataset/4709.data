There are two separate constitutional due process issues in the case. One is procedural, asking the Court to decide whether the West Virginia court established the procedural safeguards against excessive jury awards that the Supreme Court's 1991 decision appeared to require. The second question asks the Court to resolve the substantive issue of whether the $10 million award was so disproportionate as to be unconstitutional. The case will be argued in the spring.

There were also these developments at the Court today: Old Policy and New

President-elect Bill Clinton's promise to withdraw the current executive order on the treatment of Haitian refugees has put the Court at risk of wasting time because the Court has agreed to hear the Bush Administration's defense of the current policy in a case due to be argued in February.

After Mr. Clinton's election, lawyers representing the Haitian refugees asked the Court to suspend further work on the case until after Inauguration Day to give the new President a chance to make the case moot. Without comment, the Court denied the request. Justices Blackmun and Souter dissented, also without comment. The case is McNary v. Haitian Centers Council, No. 92-344.

The Court has not yet announced whether it will hear another case that presents a similar problem in a different area of policy. The Bush Administration is appealing a ruling by a Federal appeals court in California that reinstated a lawsuit by a lesbian Army reservist, Dusty Pruitt, challenging her discharge for violating the Army's regulation against homosexuality. In reinstating the lawsuit last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the Army had not provided adequate justifications for its policy.

The Bush Administration's appeal, Cheney v. Pruitt, No. 92-389, argues that the Army should not have to defend its policy and that the lawsuit should have been dismissed. President-elect Clinton has said he will lift the bar against homosexuals' serving in the military. Cable Television

Accepting an appeal from the Federal Communications Commission, the Court agreed to decide the validity of a section of the 1984 Federal law that provides a regulatory framework for cable television.

The law permits cable operators who serve residential customers in one building or in a group of buildings owned by a single individual or company to operate without a local license, while requiring other operators to have a license. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the distinction violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.

Because it is extremely unusual for a court to invalidate an economic regulation on equal protection grounds, the case, F.C.C. v. Beach Communications, No. 92-603, is important beyond the rather narrow regulatory dispute that it involves. The broader issue is whether the Federal courts will be scrutinizing regulations of this sort more critically than in the past.
