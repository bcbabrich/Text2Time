First, what they do know:

“If you are a woman who is pregnant, you really shouldn’t be going south,” was Dr. Varma’s blunt recommendation.

While Zika generally causes no symptoms or only mild illness in most healthy adults, it can do great harm to a developing fetus, sometimes causing microcephaly, a condition in which babies have unusually small heads and damage to the brain. So while most individuals do not have much to worry about, the virus strikes at the heart of what keeps humankind going: our ability to reproduce.

“As a species, that is a dangerous thing,” Dr. Varma said.

The city and federal health authorities currently recommend that any woman who is pregnant, or planning on becoming pregnant, and who has spent time in one of the countries where the virus is endemic be tested. Because some 80 percent of the people who contract the virus show no symptoms, it is critical that doctors consider detailed travel histories of pregnant women and their partners to determine if they might be at risk. The virus can also be transmitted through sexual contact.

There are about five million arrivals from countries that are now infected with Zika at New York City airports every year, so even though there has been no mosquito-borne transmission here, the threat posed by the virus is very real.

Zika tests are far from perfect, according to Mr. Lipkin. There are two methods of discovering the virus in the body: Doctors can look for its genetic markers, or look for the antibodies the body creates to do battle with the virus.

The first test can be performed when the viral load in the body is high, roughly within the first 12 days of infection. The other, however, cannot be done until about two weeks after infection, after allowing time for the host to build up antibodies.

Most people who have no symptoms and have shown a negative on all the tests can be relatively sure they are in the clear.
