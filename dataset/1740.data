But theater tickets?

In an unusual move, patrons at recent performances of a play in Chicago called “El Grito del Bronx” were offered refunds if they weren’t satisfied with the show. Of the approximately 3,000 people who saw the production during its 20-performance run, only 14 asked for — and got — their money back.

The program sparked much chatter in Chicago theater circles and in the blogosphere. Some people thought the program was a refreshing way for theater companies to attract new audiences and produce difficult works. Others thought it negatively commodified the theatergoing experience.
