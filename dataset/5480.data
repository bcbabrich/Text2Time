The G.M. Hughes Electronics Corporation said that it had acquired M/A-COM Telecommunications of Germantown, Md., for $105 million. The company, which was a subsidiary of M/A-COM Inc., of Burlington, Mass., manufactures digital communications equipment used in satellite systems that link subscribers - mainly businesses with widely dispersed branches - in much the same way that telephone systems do. Donald J. Atwood, president of G.M. Hughes Electronics, said M/A-Com Telecommunications, which has been renamed Hughes Network Systems, would complement Hughes Communications Inc., a manufacturer of satellite equipment.
