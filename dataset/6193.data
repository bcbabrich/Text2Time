Mayor Beame declared himself opposed yesterday to all 10 proposals for revision of the New York City Charter, on the ground that the changes, whatever their merit, would be ili‐timed and possibly too costly in light of the city's fiscal plight.

While paying tribute to the “well‐intentioned efforts” of the State Charter Revision Commission, Mr. Beame echoed’ the two major criticisms that opponents of Charter revisions have issued in recent weeks.

“The coming months will require maximum flexibility to ‘respond to tightening financial constraints and increasingly ‘specific mandates from other levels of government,” he said. “In these extraordinary circumstances, approval of any major changes in the City Charter would be ill‐timed.”

Although the Mayor did not endorse the estimate of Controller Harrison J. Goldin that adoption of all 10 Charter revisions could cost as much as $330‐million a year, he said that “at a time when we're cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in personnel and services from the budget, we cannot afford to bear the cost of implementing these proposed changes.”
