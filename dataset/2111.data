Each month, The Journal, the New York City Housing Authority’s monthly tabloid newspaper, publishes a Not Wanted List of former public housing residents who have been “permanently excluded,” because of criminal arrests or for being nuisances, a broad category known as “nondesirability.”

As Manny Fernandez explains in a front-page article, the Housing Authority is within its legal rights to exclude violent and disruptive tenants, but some of those on the list say that they are being punished permanently for past mistakes and that it is unfair for them to be prevented from visiting family members, including ailing and elderly parents. Although there is an appeals process, the Housing Authority can move to evict a family found harboring someone on the Not Wanted List.

Mets Complete Stunning Collapse

With an 8-1 loss to the Florida Marlins, the Mets were eliminated from postseason competition, completing one of the biggest collapses in baseball history. With the Phillies now headed to the playoffs, Mets fans are left to contemplate the future of the team’s manager, Willie Randolph, for whom the collapse has been a bitter disappointment. The team will also have to dismantle two auxiliary seating boxes it had placed beside each dugout last week.

The Times’s coverage of the Mets’ debacle includes an article by Robert D. McFadden on the dismayed reaction of Mets fans, as well as columns by William C. Rhoden and George Vecsey.

The Daily News’s main article on the Mets’ devastation notes the agony of fans. The News’s cover: “From Champs to Chumps.”

The New York Post’s front-page headline reads “Cryin’ Shame” and its lead article on the team’s debacle quips, “It’s never been more appropriate for a team to play in a city called Flushing.”

Plaza Hotel’s Centennial

The Plaza Hotel opened 100 years ago today, adjacent to the southeastern corner of Central Park, and James Barron chronicles the hotel’s storied history and surprising future. The Plaza — where Truman Capote held his famous Black and White Ball in 1966 — is now being converted into one of the most expensive condominium properties in the city. A much smaller hotel will continue to occupy the building. A slide show of images from the Plaza accompanies the article.

The New York Sun tallies the profit that Elad Properties, the developer, stands to make in converting the Plaza to a hotel-condominium.

On City Room, Curtis Gathje, a writer and editor, has been taking questions from readers about the Plaza’s history.

Questions in Gotbaum Death

The city’s public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, said she was awaiting results of an investigation into the death of her stepdaughter-in-law, Carol A. Gotbaum, who was found dead in a police holding cell at a Phoenix airport on Friday after being detained and prevented from boarding a flight.

An article on the Web site of Channel 12 News in Phoenix quotes airline officials as saying that Carol Gotbaum had become agitated after arriving late for a flight and discovering that the jetway had already become disconnected from the plane.

The Daily News quotes a Phoenix police spokesman as saying that Carol Gotbaum could not have been alone for more than 5 to 10 minutes. The News also quotes unnamed airport workers as saying that Ms. Gotbaum was agitated and screamed “I’m not a terrorist!” while being restrained.

Carol Gotbaum’s husband, Noah, is the son of Victor Gotbaum, Betsy Gotbaum’s husband and the former leader of District Council 37, New York City’s largest consortium of public sector unions.

Spitzer’s Green Team

Eliot Spitzer has assembled a team of the state’s leading environmental advocates in his effort to give the State Department of Environmental Conservation a greater role and prominence in the formation of state environmental policy.

Canadian Dollar Reaches Parity With American Dollar

The Canadian dollar, or loonie, has reached parity with the American dollar, prompting speculation that many more Canadians will be traveling south of the border for shopping and tourism excursions in New York City and other United States destinations. On Friday, the Canadian dollar, known as the loonie, hit a new 31-year high of almost $1.01. In early 2002, it was worth about 62 cents. Canada is already the second largest source of foreign tourists to New York City, after Britain, and the city is about to establish a tourism office in Toronto.

Bloomberg Addresses Britain’s Tories

Speaking of the British: As part of a quick trip to France and England, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg addressed members of Britain’s Conservative Party at their conference in the decaying seaside resort of Blackpool, England. As Diane Cardwell explains, the mayor used his speech to defend principles of fiscal conservatism, which he said American conservatives had largely abandoned. In June, Mr. Bloomberg left the Republican Party and declared himself a political independent. In England, the mayor also defended his own record of fiscal stewardship; spending and taxes have grown under his watch.

The New York Sun reports that Diana Torres, who started the New York office of Think London, which encouraged businesses to do business in the British capital, has switched sides and will work for the Partnership for New York City’s efforts to keep New York globally competitive. Ms. Torres is half-American but grew up in Britain and was educated at Cambridge University.
