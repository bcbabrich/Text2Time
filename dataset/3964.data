Military budgets may not be rising sharply anymore, but that has not eliminated Pentagon waste, a new study says.

The Council for a Livable World, an arms control advocacy group that has sought reductions in military spending, and Taxpayers for Common Sense, cite examples of $29 billion in wasteful programs in a report to be released on Monday.

The report details such projects as construction of a third golf course at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, a money-losing dairy herd at the Naval Academy, a Pentagon-leased hotel in Orlando, Fla., that loses $27 million a year, and a door hinge for the C-17 airplane that costs $2,187.

"Unfortunately, these examples are only the tip of the iceberg," the report said.

A Pentagon spokeswoman, Susan Hanson, said that while she had not examined the report, such examples were closely investigated by Pentagon officials and often were corrected quickly. In other cases, she said, the "waste" alleged in the report may represent justifiable spending.
