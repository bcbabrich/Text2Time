''Most of them were living in New York and Jewish,'' she said, ''and most of them were doing other things, like driving taxicabs. It was a wonderful experience for them to show their work.''

After that, she produced a show of American graffiti artists, ''Off the Wall,'' by street artists in their teens and 20's. She has been asked to replicate the show in Paris, using both American and French artists.

Even though she is still not breaking even in earnings (Kowa Realty has donated the space, and she subsidizes her expenses from her touring business), she is enthusiastic about the project. She is already planning to present a group show of international lithographs and silkscreens this spring, along with shows by artists from Italy and Austria. Eventually, she hopes to set up a show of art by Russians in the Soviet Union.

Her affinity for the visual arts comes naturally. Her grandfather was an art collector. Her father was a painter, philosopher and avid reader and ran a family silk design and art textile business. Her seven brothers and sisters are all involved in aspects of the arts as painters, film directors, musicians, fabric designers and yoga instructors.

Ms. Hillyer, who was born in Osaka, Japan, and raised in Kyoto, studied piano, composition and musicology at Toho Conservatory in Japan and then emigrated to study at Boston University, planning to be a musician. There she met her husband, Raphael Hillyer, the founder of the Juilliard String Quartet. She abandoned her performance aspirations and traveled with him for three years as a backstage wife, where she learned about the practical aspects of the music world.

''When I got tired and bored, I started helping artists,'' she said. ''It was very useful to me.''

In 1970, she formed Kazuko Hillyer International Inc., a performing arts production and management concern that produces about 2,000 events a year and has arranged tours for a variety of clients, including the Metropolitan Opera, the Grand Kabuki, the Jewish Theater of Rumania and the Zambia National Folk and Music Ensemble. She has also arranged tours for more than 40 international orchestras and managed the careers of numerous performing artists.

She has also taken a leading role in many humanitarian causes. Several years ago, she was walking on the beach in the Hamptons and asked herself, ''Why hasn't anyone done anything for the Cambodian boat people? Maybe that's because they're Asian and don't have any representation here.''
