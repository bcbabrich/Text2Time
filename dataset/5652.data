More than 200 farm banks have more ''problem'' loans than capital, a rise of more than 50 percent since the end of 1985, according to the Independent Bankers Association of America.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has 604 agricultural banks on its list of troubled institutions, up from 456 on Dec. 31. Of the 128 banks that have gone under or required Federal assistance this year, 56 were farm banks.
