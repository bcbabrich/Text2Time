FOR a week, you have eyed that five-pound box of cheap cookies that a business associate sent over. You have wondered what to do with the scraps of Christmas ham.

You are not alone. Professional caterers have dealt with the leftovers problem year in and year out. They have to. You may worry about how leftovers will affect your waistline. They worry about how waste affects their bottom line.

So what does happen to perfectly edible food that caterers prepare but the guests don't eat? And what about the end pieces from many sides of smoked salmon or the stems from 100 pounds of mushrooms?

If a client does not want to keep the leftover food, the caterer is responsible for disposing of it. A lot, of course, goes to shelters. Some must be thrown away for safety reasons. But some can be recycled. So can food that never leaves the catering establishment: the unused parts of ham and mushrooms, broccoli and salmon.
