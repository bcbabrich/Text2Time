Eric David Laxman's sandstone sculptures of human hands suspended on steel rods are among several works by New Jersey artists installed just two weeks ago at the Bergen Museum of Art and Science. But viewing hours have been cut back since then, to Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and within a month or so, trustees said last week, the museum will close completely while it moves from a rent-free space in a county-owned building in Paramus to an undecided location.

Bergen County plans to use the 10,000-square-foot gallery space for offices, and has been nudging the museum out for years with notices and cuts in cash support. In September, the museum director, David Messer, switched to part-time, volunteer status. Bunnie Gordon, a trustee who chairs the board's relocation committee, said a firm closing date would probably be set at a meeting with county officials on Thursday. STEVE STRUNSKY
