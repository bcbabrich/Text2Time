Stress on Mechanical Aids.

Mr. Kretchmer did not say how the department's new man power, announced earlier this year, would be deployed in the cleanup operation. There have been suggestions that manual sweeping is the only way the streets will ever be made really clean.

But Mr. Kretchmer said the cost of hand labor by sanitation men — who he said earned an average of $10,500 a year with overtime — was becoming pro hibitive. He intends to rely heavily on mechanical aids to extend his manpower.

One of these aids he was especially enthusiastic about was a three‐wheeled motor scooter with a dump body, on which a sanitationman rides from street to street. The man still uses a hand broom to sweep up litter when he sees it, but he shovels it onto the scooter and does not waste time walking and pushing a conventional wheeled barrel from one litter pile to another.
