Any team -- in any sport -- that starts the season 0-7 is often doomed for a horrible year.

The Cleveland Cavaliers were 0-7 on Nov. 15. But instead of folding, the Cavaliers (15-12) have won 15 of their last 20 games to become one of the most surprising teams in the National Basketball Association.

Several players who are unheralded and underrated have helped turn around Cleveland's season. Terrell Brandon has become one of the best point guards in the Eastern Conference. And Bobby Phills, who burned the Knicks for 28 points last week, is exactly the kind of player the Knicks need: a strong, physical shooting guard who can score and defend.

Phills had a spectacular game Saturday night, scoring a career-high 43 points while making a career-high seven 3-pointers during Cleveland's 124-121 double-overtime victory over Portland.

Morale was so low during Cleveland's 0-7 start, that the team's owner, Gordon Gund, and General Manager Wayne Embry called a team meeting to assure the players that the organization had not given up on the season. By trading Price and John Williams during the off season, the Cavaliers have started to rebuild, but they are still thinking playoffs.
