Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's elevation of Lal Krishna Advani, a canny political strategist with a reputation for hawkishness on Pakistan, to the post of deputy prime minister on Saturday anoints him officially as the No. 2 man in the government and may mark him as the prime minister's successor.

Mr. Vajpayee, 77, and Mr. Advani, 74, who will retain his position as home minister, are both senior leaders of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which has led India's coalition government for most of the last four years.

Mr. Advani is a champion of India's decision to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops along the border with Pakistan and to threaten war as a means of persuading Pakistan to stop covert support of Islamic militants battling Indian rule of Kashmir.

His promotion on Saturday is part of a wide-ranging change in the leadership of the cabinet and the party that will be announced on Monday. A new generation of younger party leaders, now serving as ministers, is expected to move into organizing roles in the party in hopes they can revitalize its sagging fortunes. The party has lost a string of crucial state elections this year.
