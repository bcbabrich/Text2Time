The General Development Corporation, a real estate developer based in Miami, disclosed today that the company, its mortgage banking subsidiary and members of its senior management are facing possible criminal indictments.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, General Development said the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and a Federal grand jury have been investigating the company since April 1988.

General Development said the indictments would be based on contentions that the company concealed the fact that other home builders in General Development's developments offered similar housing at much lower prices than General Development's.

The company denied that it had attempted to conceal the cost differential and told the S.E.C. that it believes ''that there are no valid grounds for criminal proceedings.''
