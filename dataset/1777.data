To the Editor:

Re “The New World on the Two Coasts” by Anthony Tommasini [Oct. 25]:

It was curious that in Mr. Tommasini’s article he only tangentially referred to what should be the primary if not the sole measure used to assess an orchestra’s performance: how good the music sounds.

And while Gustavo Dudamel and Alan Gilbert have a world of talent and seemingly limitless potential, they would be well advised to emulate what James Levine demonstrates on a daily basis (when he’s healthy), which is the ability to both get to the heart of the music and make the orchestra sound phenomenal.

Because of Mr. Dudamel’s personal charisma, his Mahler First performance was exciting to watch, and the beginning of the last movement in particular benefited from his passion. But when one truly listened to what was going on musically, the overall performance wasn’t much more than run-of-the-mill. There were intonation, balance and ensemble issues, and the overall interpretation was somewhat herky-jerky.

Certainly an appealing component of a live performance is visual. After all, isn’t that one reason that we enjoy going to the concert hall? Who could resist Leonard Bernstein’s pulsating podium presence or the physical beauty of Seiji Ozawa’s balletlike gestures?

Nevertheless, there is no denying that even a conductor like William Steinberg, seated at the podium at the end of his career (and life), could galvanize greater power and passion from a slight nod of his head than from the antic acrobatics of youthfully energetic conductors, however impassioned and well intended.
