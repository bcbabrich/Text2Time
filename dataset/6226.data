Dozens of airports across the country are planning to place all or parts of their passenger concourses off limits to everyone but passengers as they prepare, under Federal mandate, to tighten security to snare potential hijacker's.

The move will bring a fundamental change in the experience of taking an airplane trip: No longer, at many airports, will friends, relatives and others be able to wait with passengers before takeoff in lounges adjacent to boarding gates, or be able to meet them as they step off planes.

Instead, passengers and well‐wishers will say their good‐byes, or hellos, in ticket lobbies or elsewhere at the airport away from the long, finger‐like concourses that at most jetports lead from lobbies to boarding gates.

“I think you're going to see this concept used whereever it is physically possible,” Frank Cardman, director of security for Pan Amereican World Airways, said in an interview last week.
