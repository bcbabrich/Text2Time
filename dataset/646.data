THURSDAY PUZZLE — Every now and then I have this anxiety dream, where something truly bizarre happens to The New York Times crossword puzzle on its way from Will Shortz’s desk to the print paper or the Internet. A lot of tricky stuff has to happen to get your puzzles to you, including getting them past the EMUs in one piece, so it’s not that far-fetched to think that my brain might worry about what might happen if, say, parts of the clues suddenly disappeared.

What’s that, you say? The clues really have disappeared? Oh, that. That’s what we call a design feature, not a flaw. Today’s puzzle by Timothy Polin makes good use of the phrase INVISIBLE INK, by giving us the first letter of the theme clues and leaving us to figure out how those letters relate to the answers.

For example, we have the letter K as the sole clue at 18 Across, and the answer is ECCENTRICITY. What does the letter K have to do with ECCENTRICITY? Well, if you have already solved the revealer at 67 Across, you know that we’re dealing with INVISIBLE INK. That INK has disappeared from the clue, which would be “Kink” if we weren’t in the middle of one of my anxiety dreams. Kink, of course, is a synonym for ECCENTRICITY. Similarly, “Fink” is a synonym for STOOL PIGEON (53 Across). I got held up at the S at 12 Down, because I couldn’t figure out how FOUNDER was a synonym for “Sink” and thought it was incorrect. I asked Mr. Polin about this, and I’m told that FOUNDER is a nautical term that means to fill up with water and sink.

So now that we all acknowledge that the clues aren’t really missing, I can relax and tell you that the Clue(s) of the day for me were “Frank refusal?” for NEIN and “Tough pill to swallow” for LOZENGE.

Let’s see what Mr. Polin has to say for himself:

Constructor’s Notes

Inspiration sometimes finds you in the strangest places. The phrase INVISIBLE INK had been stuck in my head for a long time, but I’d never been able to wrangle it into a good crossword theme. Last May I even submitted a Sunday-sized puzzle with a completely different theme based on the same phrase, which was rejected, mercifully, for a number of good reasons. It wasn’t until coming back from dropping someone off at the airport early one morning this past January, semi-delirious from lack of sleep, that I had this sudden insight: Tim, you moron. Make the INK invisible in the clues, not in the grid. Duh. O.K., so I have a pretty simple word game. You can convert one of this puzzle’s six theme answers into an equally viable answer for the same clue by altering (no adding or subtracting) just one letter. Can you figure it out? I’ll post the answer on XWord Info. Good luck!

So, let that be a lesson to all you aspiring constructors out there: When in doubt, swap the clues for the entries. You never know what might work.

Mr. Polin and I both agreed that a good video for this post would be a certain scene from Monty Python’s “Life of Brian” that speaks of “derring-do.” Unfortunately, that scene is not standards-friendly, but you are more than welcome to look it up. It features Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate and Graham Chapman as his friend with the name that cannot be written here.

Since we can’t post that bit of hilarity, let’s go in the opposite direction and listen to the actor and director ANDRE Gregory tell Wallace Shawn about reality in the 1981 film “My Dinner With ANDRE.”
