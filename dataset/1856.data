“So the B.C.S. seems to be damned if it does and damned if it doesn’t, a neat trick, even for such a fundamentally flawed institution,” Dan Shanoff writes in this week’s Play Newsletter.

Shanoff continues:

Personally, I would like to see Mr. Slive take his ball and go home: “SEC-ede” from the B.C.S. and create his own playoff; as the nation’s strongest conference (by far — it boasts the past two national champs), he has the juice to do it.

Invite more playoff-friendly conferences, even individual teams, into the mix (and don’t be afraid to go it alone). Create room for the non-B.C.S. schools to participate. Generate billions in revenue from TV networks and advertisers. And isolate the Big Ten and Pac-10, daring them to try to proclaim one of their member schools — even an undefeated one — as “national champ” while the rest of the country has turned its attention to a thrilling 8- or 16-team playoff. Any school that doesn’t want to participate doesn’t have to; I imagine that resistance will be short-lived.

Incremental measures won’t work. Obstructionist colleagues need to be marginalized.

To save the B.C.S., they need to destroy it.
