The apparent conflict over whether Syria does or does not back the Lebanese and Hezbollah position is more than a matter of semantics.

Leaders of Hezbollah, the main guerrilla movement in the south, have said they will not abandon their war until Israel gives up Shabaa Farms, a mountainous stretch of land at the base of Mount Hermon in the Golan Heights, and releases all Lebanese held in Israeli jails.

The Lebanese government, which has permitted the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militia to operate freely in the south and has lauded it as a national liberation force, has echoed the Hezbollah threats.

But at the same time, the government and Hezbollah are tightly tied to Syria, which has some 30,000 soldiers and an undisclosed number of intelligence agents in Lebanon. So a Syrian decision to accept Israel's withdrawal as full compliance with Resolution 425 would obligate Lebanon and the militia to follow suit.

As far as the United Nations resolutions are concerned, Shabaa Farms is part of the land Israel seized from Syria along with the Golan Heights. Lebanese officials have said they want all their land restored, regardless of when it was occupied.

United Nations officials, including Mr. Roed-Larsen, have said recently that the ownership of Shabaa Farms is a matter to be decided between Syria and Lebanon. The two countries have never agreed on an international border between them.

Shabaa Farms is a rocky, mountainous tract along Lebanon's southeastern border, strategic because it overlooks the Golan Heights and also southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa region along Lebanon's border with Syria. Seven small rivers that feed into the Jordan all converge in a depression of the Shabaa Farms land.
