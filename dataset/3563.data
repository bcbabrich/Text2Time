The New York Times Company dismissed 23 employees at an administrative center in Norfolk, Va., yesterday for violating the company's e-mail policy, a company spokeswoman said.

The workers -- men and women in a variety of departments and functions -- were among 200 employees at a center that processes invoices, pay and benefits for the company's various divisions.

An unspecified number of other employees received disciplinary warning letters over the incident, which involved internally circulated e-mail, the company said.

The company would not elaborate on the basis for the dismissal except to say that the employees had violated a policy specifying that ''computer communications must be consistent with conventional standards of ethical and proper conduct, behavior and manners and are not to be used to create, forward or display any offensive or disruptive messages, including photographs, graphics and audio materials.''
