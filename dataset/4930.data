To the Editor: Regarding the article ''You Can't Be Too Thin in Economy Class'' (Practical Traveler, March 4), I'd like you to know that relief is in sight. As of May 15, Virgin Atlantic is converting all its 747's on the Atlantic to new, specially contoured seats that will give at least seven inches more legroom than on British Airways.
