Christopher Rouse's Trombone Concerto, which received its world premiere in a performance by Leonard Slatkin leading the New York Philharmonic on Wednesday night in Avery Fisher Hall, is an obsessive work. The trombone, an instrument typically associated with slides and energy and swing, with sudden moves and blasts, is here turned into an almost introspective isolate: lyrically mourning, then raging and mourning again. At the beginning, it sings a low, two-note sigh that is almost a groan. Slowly, as if through accumulated grief, that motif grows, supported by shimmers in the orchestra and given energy by roiling percussive thunder.

The work is distinctive, unsettling, yet structurally clear. It was a Philharmonic commission for the orchestra's 150th anniversary and was given a stunningly virtuosic performance by Joseph Alessi, the principal trombonist.

Given the occasion, it is suitable that the work bears the dedication "In memoriam Leonard Bernstein." Its three movements, played without pause, form a kind of elegy. It even quotes a theme from Bernstein's "Kaddish" Symphony, though Mr. Rouse's version of the "Kaddish" -- the Jewish prayer of mourning -- seems untempered by faith.

Mr. Rouse has become one of the most-performed composers of his generation (he was born in 1949). His "Infernal Machine," "Gorgon" and other works have an almost animalistic energy, straining at the bounds of concert-hall manners. He has quoted Shostakovich in his music, but also Led Zeppelin. He has recently completed a cello concerto and is working on a flute concerto and a second symphony.
