Doug provided a serious 20-minute lecture on raft safety. He explained what to do if we were tossed into the rapids -- lean back, keep your legs up, let the water carry you forward, never try to put your feet down to stand, you might get caught under a rock and dragged under -- and how to escape if you fall in and get caught under the raft. The neophyte rafters glanced around nervously. Most of us were first-timers whose biggest worries had been falling out of the raft and where we'd go to the bathroom. But we donned our life jackets and scrambled onboard. Our fears lifted as the boats caught the current and the journey began.

We were hardly around the first bend in the river when we spotted two moose drinking near the water's edge. The wildlife generally steers clear of the human traffic because of an annual fall hunting season in the region that leaves the wildlife wary year round. But during the week, we spotted several eagles soaring far above our heads, lots of bighorn sheep scrambling across sheer rock, a black bear, and a varied assortment of mink, snakes, ducks and marmosets.

At our first campsite, I noticed what I assumed were bobcat or mountain lion tracks right next to our portable toilet. Malcolm confirmed that bobcats were local residents.

Nervous apprehension about the rapids gave way after the first few rides through serious white water. Those of us who braved the front of the raft got the wettest; those in the back got the more thrilling ride. While not for the faint of heart, these rapids amount to a great roller-coaster. By the end of the trip, the white knuckles gripping the safety ropes had loosened, and everyone was hoping for at least one Class IV experience. The river eased us in, giving us two days of increasingly thrilling rides that peaked on the third and fourth days with treacherous white water at Salmon Falls and Vinegar rapids, both of which were close to Class IV experiences.

At Salmon Falls, Steve, a real-estate manager for the University of California, took a scary spill in his first ducky ride, and slid like a child's toy through the white water, safe but shaken. But the river, with its swift currents and swirling eddies, is hardly the whole experience. Each campsite provides its own wonders. At one, Melanie, an art teacher from Moscow, Idaho, and a lifelong outdoors enthusiast, lead a few of us up the canyon where she found the skeletal remains of a young buck, untouched after it had died the previous winter.

At our last campsite, a ragged bighorn sheep wandered into camp and started nibbling on sneakers and T-shirts left out to dry. The determined scavenger would not be chased away, virtually demanding a handout for herself and an adorable lamb that followed her deftly down the rocks.

Holiday, for an additional $50, provides tents, sleeping bags, mats and rain gear. David, my travel companion, is a former Boy Scout, but we still fumbled helplessly with our tent the first night. By the end of the week, we were pros.
