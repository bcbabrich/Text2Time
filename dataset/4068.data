To the Editor:

Your Oct. 31 front-page article about the ancient enmities producing continuing clashes between the Hutu and Tutsi communities in Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi brings back memories of my experiences with the genocide in Burundi when I was the United States Ambassador there from 1969 to 1972.

The 1972 Hutu-Tutsi confrontation, resulting in more than 150,000 deaths, was violent and ferocious. In my research on the two communities, I found that the Hutu-Tutsi alienation had been reported by the Germans and Belgians during their colonial administrations from 1894 until 1962. Outbreaks of fighting were controlled by those colonial powers.

Since independence was granted to both Rwanda and Burundi in 1962, blood baths and genocides have occurred periodically: two in Rwanda and three in Burundi.

Now the whole area, including Zaire, is involved in bloodletting that gives the indication of turning into a holocaust.
