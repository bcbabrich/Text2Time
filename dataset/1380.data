There’s a stereotype of tennis — fair or not — that it is a gentlemen’s sport. The players, like the game itself, are supposed to be polite and mild-mannered individuals with affluent backgrounds.

Alex Bogomolov is not like that. And he knows it.

“I grew up differently,” he said. “I’m not the uptight tennis player most people think of.”

Bogomolov, who lost in men’s doubles Thursday, will take the court again Friday against Rogerio Dutra da Silva of Brazil in the second round of men’s singles. He defeated Steve Johnson, with whom he has played doubles in the past, in the first round Wednesday.

“I didn’t do too many things well besides mentally give myself a chance to stay in the match,” Bogomolov said. “The good thing is, I always fight through the adversity.”

That resiliency is rooted in his upbringing. Russian immigrants, his family did not live the lavish lifestyle his tennis peers enjoyed. Instead, he had a passionate father, also named Alex, who was a prominent tennis player in the Soviet Union and went on to become a successful coach.

When he was 9, the Bogomolovs moved to Mexico, then two years later to Miami, where Bogomolov Sr. ran a tennis academy.

Bogomolov Jr. and his sister also took to tennis and were coached by their father, and his sister’s traveling schedule led Bogomolov Sr. to go on the road much of the year. To continue developing as a player, an 11-year-old Bogomolov was sent to Brooklyn to work with a friend of his father. Over the next decade, Bogomolov spent half the year in Brooklyn and the other half in Miami, honing his game.

In New York, Bogomolov and his friends attended the Open each summer but never paid for a ticket; they would find a way to sneak in. The group would look for fights, and at 16, Bogomolov landed in a holding cell after he was arrested for fighting at the Port Washington Tennis Academy. Still, Bogomolov takes pride in his upbringing.

“I feel like everybody wanted to prove to the others that we got each other’s backs,” Bogomolav said. “It was just the way it was.”

Bogomolov’s resiliency has been tested more than in just Wednesday’s match.

First, there was the pressure of not living up to the expectations as a top junior player.

Then there was a messy divorce from the tennis player Ashley Harkleroad, whom he married when he was 21 and divorced two years later.

“I was in debt for a long time because of it,” he said. “I would have a good result, pay off some of the debt, then not do so well. I never had any momentum.”

Another blow came in 2008. During an event in South Korea, Bogomolov fell on his wrist, but felt no pain and went on to win the match. He woke up the next day unable to move the wrist. A doctor’s visit revealed he had torn ligaments.

“It was like a knockout punch,” Bogomolov said.

Bogomolov was told he might never be able to use a two-handed backhand again. Then came a break that he said changed his life. A week after returning from Korea, he met Luana Goncalves at a car convention in Miami. The two remained in contact and in the week leading up to his surgery in January 2009 he stayed in New Jersey with Goncalves, who moved to the United States from Brazil as a child.

After surgery, Bogomolov took a job as a consultant for a tennis academy in New York with hopes of getting back on the court. But rehabbing did not go as well as expected, and he could not hit a ball without pain.

Then he got some unexpected news.

“I came back from work one day and she told me she was pregnant,” Bogomolov said of Goncalves. “A week after that, I was hitting full-on backhands. It was a miracle because before that I couldn’t even hit a backhand.”

With another mouth to feed, Bogomolov knew he had to get back on the court to make some money.

“He realized that it was now or never,” Goncalves said.

Three months later, in June 2009, he was back on tour. He lost in last year’s United States Open qualifying tournament, but qualified for every Grand Slam event this year, advancing to the third round of Wimbledon in June. At 28, when most players are on the decline, Bogomolov is now ranked 44th, the highest in his career.

He credits his son, Maddox, now 20 months old, and Goncalves for putting him in line.

“I don’t get out of hand like I used to,” he said. “After a loss, I would get drunk and depressed. With her it was a big issue we had to change. Right away she changed that. She wouldn’t let me do that. I would pout and she would tell me to change my mentality.”
