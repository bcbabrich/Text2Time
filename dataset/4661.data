Richard Crowley, an architect who specialized in the renovation and preservation of historic structures in the Hudson Valley, died on Wednesday at his home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. He was 62 years old.

Mr. Crowley died of cancer, said a daughter, Anne.

For more than 25 years, Mr. Crowley was a central figure in efforts to preserve the store of 19th-century buildings and estates throughout the Hudson Valley. He was a co-founder of Hudson River Heritage, a private preservation group, of the Rhinebeck Historical Society and of the Dutchess County Landmarks Association, organizations that also led successful campaigns to and preserve the commerical centers of Rhinebeck and Poughkeepsie.

Mr. Crowley was a 1950 graduate of Yale College and a 1959 graduate of the Yale School of Architecture. He practiced for the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in New York City before opening his own practice in Rhinebeck in 1965.

In the mid-1960's he organized and supervised a comprehensive survey of the more than three dozen historic estates between Staatsburg in Dutchess County and Clermont in Columbia County. The survey led to the successful nomination of the mile-wide, 16-mile-long district to the National Register of Historic Places in the mid-1970's and in 1990 to the area's designation as the Hudson Valley National Historic Landmark District.
