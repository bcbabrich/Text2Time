Manager Bud Harrelson, in an effort to end a personal dispute between center fielder Vince Coleman and third- base coach Mike Cubbage as well as short-circuit what he contended were overheated reports of the affair, today reversed his approach and held a closed meeting with the principals.

"Your articles changed my mind," Harrelson told reporters after he met with Coleman and Cubbage for 15 minutes before tonight's game against the Dodgers.

Harrelson, who on Tuesday said he saw no reason to discipline or speak to Coleman about the player's verbal assault on the coach in San Diego last Friday, said he had spoken today about the incident with Al Harazin, the executive vice president of the Mets. Then Harrelson, while insisting that Harazin had in no way directed him to do anything, called Coleman and Cubbage into his office upon their arrival at Dodger Stadium.

"It's resolved, and that's all you are going to get from me," Harrelson told reporters.

Coleman, who was scratched from the lineup tonight because his injured hamstring tightened, refused to say whether he had apologized to Cubbage, but agreed that the matter was closed.
