SOMETHING about midsummer turns ray guns and missiles and marauding spaceships into old news. Suddenly the most ferocious weapon on the movie screen is the English language, as deployed so viciously by scheming, Mamet-fueled white-collar workers in Neil LaBute's stunning Sundance prize winner, ''In the Company of Men.'' At this time of year, the big guns are silenced long enough to make way for such sleepers, and they come as the perfect break between early summer's fireworks and the fall's more complex art house fare. What a jolt: we find ourselves surrounded by films by, for and about real people on planet Earth.

The culture shock of this backlash against studio extravagance is heightened by the free-for-all atmosphere that increasingly shapes the summer season. Summer counter-programming started out as a small idea, with a few art house Davids mixed in among gun-toting Hollywood Goliaths, but now it has truly caught fire. As a result, nearly all the highlights of this year's Sundance Film Festival, along with a few notable successes from Cannes and elsewhere on the festival circuit, will be competing for similar audiences during a tight midseason time period. But this year there are fewer clear standouts. And there may be more small, deserving films than the traffic will bear.

Still, the oversupply of interesting independent films is the kind of problem we can welcome. Whether startlingly assured work (Mr. LaBute's film) or just a highly promising debut (Miguel Arteta's ''Star Maps''), each of these films bodes well for a thriving independent film world. The further good news is that a cycle of slouchy, myopic coming-of-age films has given way to much more adventurous subject matter and that the independent film world often outdoes Hollywood in blending intellect with humor. In a year that began with ''The Daytrippers'' and ''Chasing Amy'' and today brings the acerbic cleverness of the Australian ''Love Serenade'' (both a Cannes and Sundance entry), it's clear that sly, single-minded thinking is alive and well.

Strong personality is the hallmark of every one of these films, for better or worse. Running the risk of abrasive self-importance is always a liability for independents, but excesses can be exhilarating when they come from the heart. Tom DiCillo's ''Box of Moonlight'' dares to resurrect the hippie-dropout scenario of the 1970's (with considerable fresh energy, and with a much lighter touch than the thematically similar ''Dream With the Fishes''). And late this month comes ''She's So Lovely,'' a fiery revival of John Cassavetes's punch-drunk romanticism as filtered through the eyes of Nick Cassavetes, the filmmaker's son.
