''If Mr. Biron had agreed to stay I certainly wouldn't have an interest in joining management,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''But with Ed deciding to leave I made a judgment that I would rather have the title for myself.''

Comfed, which operates in Massachusetts and Connecticut, has been hurt by a weakening mortgage market in New England, and Mr. O'Malley said he was concerned about the value of his investment. But he added that the Comfed had a ''decent franchise and should become a reasonable earner.''

After graduation from Manhattan College, Mr. O'Malley got his start in the mail room of Philipp Brothers, a commodities trading company. He soon moved into trading and dealt with ''just about every commodity the company handled,'' he said. He spent 10 years in Europe and then took over and successfully ran the company's energy business, ''which formed the basis for my rise through the executive ranks,'' he said.

In 1981, Philipp Brothers, by then known as Phibro, merged with Salomon Inc., the investment banking house. Mr. O'Malley left Salomon at the end of 1986 and set up the investment business, Argus Investments Inc., in Stamford, Conn.

Argus holds a 24 percent interest in the Tosco Corporaiton, a large independent refiner on the West Coast. The group then bought the luxury skyboxes at Giants Stadium and leases them out. ''We then got the Denver boxes and we are negotiating for other ones,'' Mr. O'Malley said.
