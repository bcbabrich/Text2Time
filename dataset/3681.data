A patient at a state psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane was charged yesterday with strangling his roommate to death with a pair of socks, the authorities said.

Archie F. Bristol, 30, is being held without bail in the Orange County Jail, charged with the slaying Friday morning of Anthony Pizzo at the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, about 75 miles northwest of New York City, the state police said.

The two men had an argument around 7:50 A.M. and had to be separated by hospital personnel, the police said.

Mr. Pizzo's body was discovered in his room after staff members noticed that neither man had lined up for breakfast roll call.
