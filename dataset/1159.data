OTTAWA — The Canadian government will allow Conrad Black, the former publisher, to return to the land of his birth when he finishes serving his sentence for fraud and obstruction of justice in a Florida jail, The Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday.

Mr. Black gave up his Canadian citizenship in 2001 to accept a British peerage. His criminal conviction, which came in Chicago in 2007, meant that under Canadian immigration law he was unable to return to his Toronto home after his release from the American penal system, which may take place this weekend.

But the newspaper said that Mr. Black had been granted a special permit that will allow him to enter Canada and remain for one year. His plans after that are unclear although last August he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation he might try to regain his Canadian citizenship.

Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, a Conservative, said that he avoided any involvement in Mr. Black’s case and that the permit was handled by public servants. Mr. Kenney said that the government granted about 10,000 temporary permits a year, many of them going to people with criminal convictions.

But Thomas Mulcair, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party, insisted in the House of Commons that “the British criminal Conrad Black,” who strongly backed the Conservatives when he owned a Canadian newspaper chain, received special treatment because several people who had served much shorter sentences in American prisons for nonviolent offenses had been denied permits.

“There’s obviously one set of standards for Conservative Party insiders and another that applies to everyone else,” he said.
