Buying furniture from interior designers is like adopting a puppy from veterinarians: they can expertly assess how the addition will fit into your home. Two such professionals, Michael Reeves and Robert Marinelli (above, behind Mr. Reeves's Carnegie Hi-Back chair, $4,105), opened the RM/MR store in the meatpacking district last month. ''As an interior designer, I often couldn't find a plain sofa my client could embellish around,'' Mr. Reeves said. ''It was the same for Robert.'' Mr. Reeves, based in London, and Mr. Marinelli, based in New York, designed most of the furniture in RM/MR, and their aesthetics match as neatly as their palindromic initials. The walls are earth tones, and the concrete floors are a translucent metallic bronze. Mr. Marinelli's Rio cocktail table is $5,500. The lamp is $880.
