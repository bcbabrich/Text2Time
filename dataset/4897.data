And a few years before that, he was reported to have accepted the coaching post with the Philadelphia Stars of the United States Football League. Instead, he remained at East Lansing.

Perles compiled an admired record as a pro assistant with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He left them for Michigan State, his alma mater, after the 1981 season. He served under Chuck Noll as defensive-line coach, defensive coordinator and assistant head coach. He was the line coach of the famed Steel Curtain defensive front, which helped lead the Steelers to four Super Bowl victories. He has been with the Spartans since 1982.

He was also a legendary high school coach in his native Detroit, where he compiled a 23-2 record, with two state championships, at St. Ambrose from 1962 through 1964.

'Real Intense'

One of his former players at St. Ambrose, Tom Landau, a halfback, recalled yesterday that Perles was ''real intense, oriented to line play and defensive play.''

Steinberg has already said he believes defense is the first ingredient in rebuilding a team, along with the ability to run the ball.

''In his third year he took over the school's offense,'' said Landau, now a claims manager for an insurance company. ''He had a grind-it-out approach. He put a heavy emphasis onbeing able to block, even for the halfbacks.''

Landau recalls Perles as a ''streets of Detroit guy.''

''That's where he was from and it shaped the way he acted,'' he said. ''He was tough, but he was very loyal. If he thought you were with him, he stuck by you. But if he thought you weren't, you were his enemy for life.''
