An experimental reorganization of the detective operation in Queens, which would place all investigators under the authority of the uniformed borough commander, is being studied by New York City police authorities.

Under the .arrangement, the current precinct investigation units would be given expanded responsibilities to investigate more important crimes than they do now. There would also be borough homicide, robbery and sex squads that would be under a detective supervisor who would report not to the chief of detectives at headquarters, but to the uniformed borough commander.

The change would remove nearly 200 detectives in Queens from the jurisdiction of the central detective bureau. Under the plan, the bureau would also be given additional investigative responsibilities now carried â€œout by other divisions.

An Issue of Controversy

The move is part of an effort by Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire to improve the department's investigative capability. The current detective setup, introduced in 1972. has been the center of recurring controversy, with critics contending that it has resulted in a fragmentation of demand and weakened performance.
