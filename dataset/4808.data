In some ways, the Clash of the Titans tour that arrived on Friday night at Madison Square Garden could be the belated triumph of punk-rock. As Anthrax, Slayer and Megadeth played, a full house, at least two-thirds of whom were wearing black T-shirts, shouted along with lines like Anthrax's "You're anti -- you're antisocial!" or "Ain't gonna live my life this way!" From a more cynical viewpoint, it was an example of rebellion as commodity, standardized in sound (a pummeling beat, minor chords, chantlike vocals), appearance (long hair, jeans and T-shirts, or bare chests) and action (flopping that long hair to the beat).

But for all its commercialism, the music, known as thrash or speed-metal, has genuine power. The beat and guitars, simultaneously hyperactive and one-dimensional, are a perfect musical metaphor for enraged frustration, while speed-metal lyrics don't bother with any of pop's consolations, like love. During the four-hour concert, fans stomped and shouted along with lyrics about fighting racism (Anthrax's "Keep It in the Family"), censorship (Megadeth's "Hook in Mouth") or dying on the battlefield (Slayer's "Mandatory Suicide"). Thrash recognizes, and tries to exorcise, the malevolent powers that greet adolescents on the verge of adulthood, often with lyrics that switch from the perspective of victim to victimizer. In concert, words are often lost in the roar, but that hardly matters; fans have learned them from the albums' lyric sheets.

While the music has strict parameters, each band adds its own shadings. Anthrax is least hemmed in by thrash conventions. There's a certain jaunty Little Rascals aura to the band as members race around the stage and the lead singer, Joe Belladonna, works the crowd like a cheerleader. Anthrax's guitarist, Scott Ian, has a shaved head and baggy shorts that come from the wardrobe of hardcore rock; Anthrax also ventures into styles outside thrash, including the pop of Joe Jackson's "Got the Time," the rap of "I'm a Man" (which sounds like a Beastie Boys imitation) and a new effort, a version of Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" with blaring guitar backup. For the encore, Anthrax was joined by Chuck D. and Flavor-Flav of Public Enemy, who leaped around the stage to rival the members of Anthrax.

Where Anthrax is relatively eclectic, Slayer is purist; it plays pounding, crushing thrash -- half-speed, regular and double-time -- behind Tom Araya's savage growl, while its lead guitars wail between verses. Slayer has a gimmick; it writes about death and Satanic rituals, piling on horrific details but neither praising nor condemning them, with lines like "I rule this inferno/Enthroned for eternity."
