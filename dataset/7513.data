Following is a transcript of President Johnson's address last night at the Democratic rally in Madison Square Gar­den, as recorded by The New York Times through the facili­ties of A.B.C. News:

Mayor Wagner and my fel­low countrymen:

I heard about your little party, and I just thought I'd drop by.

Your welcome has been affectionate and warm and generous, and Lady Bird and Lynda and Luci and I just can't thank you enough.

I guess about all we can say is that we're very grate­ful and may God grant that I never disappoint the great and gallant man who selected me as Vice President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And that I never disappoint you or fail you. To those talented people who produced and created this great show tonight, I send my personal gratitude.

I want to especially thank Jerry Finkelstein and Eddie Weisl Jr. and Martin Davis and their staff and Hy Brown and his staff and Kirk Douglas and my very dear friend, Gregory Peck, and Mitch Miller and Tony Ben­nett and Diahann Carroll and Bob Merrill and Connie Francis and Jill St. John and all of the many others who had such a part in making this such a delightful evening —thank you, thank you from the bottom of our heart.

Prayers Requested

I have come to New York in these final hours of this campaign. I come to say to you once again that your President will need your prayers and your President will need your support.
