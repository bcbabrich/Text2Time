Tears of thanks welled up in REGGIE WHITE's eyes when the Green Bay Packers defensive star accepted a $143,261 check from donations to rebuild the Tennessee church where he serves as an associate pastor.

You'll have to be patient with me for a minute," White said during the ceremony in Green Bay, Wis. "You might see a big man cry right here."

Authorities have said that the fire at the Inner City Church in Knoxville may have been racially motivated, although the congregation is multiracial. White, who is black, said about 85 percent of donations came from white people. (AP)
