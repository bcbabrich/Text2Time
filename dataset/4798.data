Three soldiers were killed and 18 people were wounded in a mortar attack late tonight on an Ulster Defense Regiment post south of Belfast, the police said.

Belfast's Downtown Radio reported that several missiles had been fired at the post in Glenann, County Armagh, about 40 miles south of Belfast.

At least one explosion shook houses in the town of Dundalk, 15 miles away, and could be heard in Balbriggan, 50 miles to the north of Glenann.

"There are three UDR men believed dead and 18 others injured, some of whom might be civilians," said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
