The Senate Armed Services Committee has approved a $4.5 billion budget for a space-based defense against nuclear missiles while trying to write its version of a military budget, Congressional officials said today.

The $4.5 billion figure for the anti-missile program is $1.3 billion less than that sought by President Reagan but is considerably above the $3.8 billion total approved by the House Armed Services Committee.

The decision came as the Senate committee, in a closed meeting, tried to finish writing its version of a bill setting the Defense Department's budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, according to the officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified.

The four-year-old missile defense program is expected to be the center of a major debate this year in both the Senate and the House as the Democratic-controlled Congress considers the Pentagon budget. Congressional Cuts Assailed
