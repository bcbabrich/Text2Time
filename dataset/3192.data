Of the new domains, .biz and .info are farthest along the pipeline, having begun accepting applications for addresses over the summer. Some of those new addresses began operating last month.

As is the case with .com, .net and .org addresses, a .biz or .info address can be obtained through an accredited registrar. A list of accredited registrars is available at www.icann.org or at the Web sites run by the registries.

Prices for the new addresses are similar to those of other domains, $10 to $35 a year. Consumers can shop for the best rate. Higher prices do not necessarily mean better service, so check the fine print for services like renewal notification and make sure that there is a phone number and an address for the company, not just an e-mail link.

Early Problems

The registries responsible for .biz and .info, NeuLevel Inc. and Afilias Ltd., respectively, have both had some glitches. Last summer NeuLevel charged a nonrefundable fee of $2 for each .biz address application, intending to select one application at random if there was more than one applicant for an address. That led to a lawsuit, still pending, claiming that the process constituted an illegal lottery. In the meantime, .biz addresses for which there was only one application began functioning in early October. NeuLevel plans to open real-time registration on Wednesday, so that applications will be processed as they are submitted.

Afilias used a different procedure for .info names, allowing trademark owners to submit applications for addresses (Coke.info, for example) before opening the system to the public. Loopholes enabled some people to register .info addresses using false trademark data, though Afilias has promised to challenge those registrations and invalidate any made with false information. Despite that glitch, Afilias opened its system to general registration in September, and .info addresses registered in the preliminary phase began functioning in October. Once again, some domain resellers have been busy buying up names so some .biz and .info addresses have already been taken.

Afilias said that more than 500,000 .info names had been registered. NeuLevel said it had registered 289,000 names during its initial phase, which ended in late September. By comparison, more than 24.3 million .com, 4.9 million .net, and 3.2 million .org addresses have been registered, according to VeriSign, so plenty of choices are left in the new domains.

Next: Dot-Name

The next new domain that may be of interest to consumers is .name, which is intended to offer individuals distinct addresses for their Web sites, in the format john.smith.name. Global Name Registry, the company managing the .name domain, also plans to offer e-mail forwarding services so that .name domain holders can receive e-mail at addresses like john@smith.name.
