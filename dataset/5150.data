Seymour Krim, an author and critic, was found dead, apparently of a drug overdose, in his Manhattan apartment Wednesday night, the police said. He was 67 years old.

Mr. Krim was found in a chair in his apartment at 120 East 10th Street. A bottle of pills and notes explaining his suicide were found nearby, said Officer Edward Fenney, a police spokesman.

His body was discovered by his nephew, Donald Krim, and his lawyer, Bruce Ricker, at 6:30 P.M. Mr. Ricker said Mr. Krim had been suffering from heart disease for some time. The police said the exact cause of death would be determined by the Medical Examiner's office at a later date.

Born in New York, Mr. Krim graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and attended the University of North Carolina.
