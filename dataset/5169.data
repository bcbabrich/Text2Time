Americans tend to confound vulnerability with sensibility, especially when the vulnerable person is a writer exiled from another country. The Russian poet Igor Pomerantsev's satire on this susceptibility of ours is quoted in the introduction to ''Women's Writing in Exile,'' edited by Mary Lynn Broe and Angela Ingram (University of North Carolina).

I am a bad poet from a distant country. . . . In my life and in my conversation I give the impression of being much more talented than I really am. The key to my recognition . . . is otherness, my foreign birth and language. But . . . it happens to be the case that [ this culture ] only accepts those . . . poets who have had their finger nails pulled out at home. The vulnerability of finger nails, or their absence, is - like it or not - somehow connected with poetry. The possibility cannot be excluded that the reader, in order to justify his own creative passivity, will recognize talent only in those poets who have paid for their celebrity with their finger nails. But this means he, the reader, retains the possibility of developing some talent himself. Fate, pain, finger nails, like music, do not need translation. You believe them. Desire in the Deli

Only art can laugh at urban life in the 1980's. This is ''Brief Encounter at the Delicatessen,'' from Judith Viorst's ''Forever 50: And Other Negotiations'' (Simon & Schuster). She has no muscle tone. He has no hair. But when they meet beside the deli case, Some force within their blood begins to race. He orders half a pound of roast beef, rare, Plus one pound each of corned beef and of tongue, Along with coleslaw and a rye with seeds. (Do married middle-agers have no needs?) (Is untamed passion only for the young?) His heart beats fast. Her thoughts are most unclean. But mad desire yields to law and will. She buys three whitefish and six pickles, dill, Plus half a pound of hot pastrami, lean. Then silently they part as (sigh) they must, Surrendering to brunch instead of lust. Mom's Cosmic Pull

One envies the sensation of sheer simple causality in this account of a mother-daughter tie from ''Swann,'' a novel by Carol Shields (Viking).

Clever men create themselves, but clever women, it seems to me, are created by their mothers. Women can never quite escape their mothers' cosmic pull, not their lip-biting expectations or their faulty love. We want to please our mothers, emulate them, disgrace them, oblige them, outrage them, and bury ourselves in the mysteries and consolations of their presence. When my mother and I are in the same room we work magic on each other: I grow impossibly cheerful and am guilty of reimagined naivete and other indulgent stunts, and my mother's sad, helpless dithering becomes a song of succour. Within minutes, we're peddling away, the two of us, a genetic sewing machine that runs on limitless love. It's my belief that between mothers and daughters there is a kind of blood-hyphen that is, finally, indissoluble.
