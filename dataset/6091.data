The treasurer and the director of aviation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were suspended without pay late yesterday after admitting “irregularities” in their expense accounts, the agency announced.

The suspensions of the two men—Alexander Leslie, the treasurer, who is paid $52,000 a year, and Caesar B. Pattarini, the aviation director, who receives $61,000—were ordered and announced by Peter C. Goldmark Jr., the authority's executive director.

Mr. Goldmark said both officials “had voluntarily reported the irregularities and in each case the individual had indicated his willingness to reimburse the Port Authority for the minor amounts of money involved.”

The action came five days after the suspension of another top official of the agency, John Tillman, the $55,000‐a‐year chief spokesman and director of public affairs, who admitted after an investigation by The New York Times that he had regularly padded his expense accounts with fictitious entries since 1974.
