The Tribeca Film Festival has added a free screening of John Singleton’s breakout movie, “Boyz N the Hood,” to its lineup. The filmmaker died Monday after suffering a stroke.

The movie, about three black teenagers growing up amid gang violence in South-Central Los Angeles, made Singleton, then 24, the youngest person and the first African-American nominated for a best directing Oscar. The movie debuted in 1991 as the police beating of Rodney King dominated headlines.

Singleton “filled his characters’ lives with warmth and humor even as they were constantly menaced, and often destroyed, by violence,” the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote in an appraisal of the filmmaker's work. “He infused familiar coming-of-age and gangster-movie tropes with a rare authenticity.”

The director “accomplished what all creators strive to. He entertained, but also inspired a generation of audiences,” Jane Rosenthal, a co-founder of the festival, said in a statement. “We want to celebrate him as we consider the legacy that he has left behind.”
