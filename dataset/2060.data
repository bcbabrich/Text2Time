With a draw against Vladimir Malakhov of Russia, Alexander Grischuk, also of Russia, joined Gata Kamsky of the United States and Peter Leko of Hungary as victors in their preliminary candidates matches. Judit Polgar, another Hungarian, staved off elimination by beating Evgeny Bareev of Russia, although she still trails 3 to 2 with one game to play. (If matches are tied after six games, there will be tie-breaker games to determine who goes through to the next round.) Magnus Carlsen of Norway also won, squaring his match with Levon Aronian of Armenia at 2.5.

The matches are taking place in Elista, Kalmykia, to select four qualifiers for the world championship tournament in Mexico City in September and October. The games can be replayed here at the official Web site for the matches.

Polgar, who has been outplayed throughout the match, launched a speculative attack against Bareev on the White side of a Caro-Kann Defense, but Bareev missed two chances to survive the onslaught, first with 22 … Qb3 instead of 22 … Qb2, and then with 23 … Rf7 instead of 23 … gh.

The Carlsen-Aronian match has been the most exciting of the preliminary matches with both players winning twice with only one draw. In today’s game, Carlsen got a good position on the White side of a Queens Indian and then worked up an attack on Aronian’s king. Aronian was able to force the trade of queens to end the attack, but in the resulting endgame, Carlsen had a powerful pawn on f6. He then used excellent technique to create a winning position. It almost seems a shame that one of these players will not make it through to the next round.

Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Boris Gelfand of Israel drew their fifth straight game. Although that might sound boring, the games have not been. They have just been incredibly hard fought by two players with similar styles who are experts in the systems that they employ. In today’s game, Kasimdzhanov, as Black, played a Semi-Slav. He allowed his pawn structure to be wrecked and stranded his king in the center, but he got fantastic play for his pieces, creating a dynamic position. Although Gelfand eventually won a pawn, Kasimdzhanov showed that he had enough resources to secure a draw.

Michael Adams of England drew with Alexei Shirov of Spain to preserve his 3 to 2 lead. Sergei Rublevsky of Russia drew against Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine and also leads 3 to 2.
