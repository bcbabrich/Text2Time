For all the talk about the poor performance outside the conference by the members of the Big East, competition within it has never been more ferocious. Some call it parity. Others say that everyone has dropped to the same level of mediocrity.

In any event, the competition is even, free flowing and, yes, exciting.

Last Wednesday, Georgetown played suffocating defense and shot uncharacteristically well from 3-point range for a 73-62 upset over Seton Hall, then the conference leader.

A day earlier, Boston College, which hasn't had a 20-victory season since 1985, upset St. John's, 71-61, to make its conference record 5-3.

On Saturday, the surging Eagles then surprised Georgetown before a delirious home crowd at the Conte Center. Bill Curley, in leading his team past Georgetown, established himself as one of, perhaps the, most dominating power forwards in the Big East.
