I’ve written about Trulia before. It is one of the many real estate sites that takes extensive data and applies it to a Google map.

The company, which started in the San Francisco area, has nationwide aspirations and it has just launched its beta site for New York City. Because of the complexity of getting information on all the multiple owners of one plot of land, most of the online real estate services skip New York City.

PropertyShark still has my vote for the most useful information source on New York.

UPDATE: I found a site with loads of real estate mash-ups and other search tools. And, of course, Mike Pegg’s Google Maps Mania keeps up to date on the latest creations. He’s got a column of real estate tools.
