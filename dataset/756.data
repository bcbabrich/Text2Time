Little is known about the snow leopards’ world. They sparsely inhabit a vast, mountainous region stretching over 12 countries. Threats to leopards’ prey vary widely over these remote areas, where research is difficult at best.

Here are three prey species known to be in decline:

NEPAL

URIAL Wild sheep in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

MARKHOR Wild goats found in northern India, northern Pakistan, Afghanistan, south Tajikistan and south Uzbekistan.

MARMOT Large ground-dwelling rodents; various species throughout the snow leopard range.

Urials dwell at lower elevations, where they are under intense pressure from a rapidly growing human population that leads to increased hunting, settlement and farming. More livestock compete with urials for grass and can transmit disease. Globally, urials have declined by perhaps a one-third over three generations; outside of protected places such as parks, many local populations have disappeared entirely.

Markhors are under threat from poaching, habitat loss and disease transmitted from livestock, as are urials. A 2010 outbreak of pleuropneumonia killed perhaps 20 percent of the population in Tajikistan. The flare-horned markhors may have declined by half in the last 25 years. Surviving populations are small and highly fragmented. Overhunting and war in the region put the markhor at risk of extinction.

Some marmots have declined by more than half in Mongolia, wiped out by unrestricted hunting for food and trade. They are prized in neighboring China for their pelts and their fat, which is believed to have medicinal value.

Marmots hibernate for five months or more during winter and are unavailable as food.

How one snow leopard, Pari, was tracked from Sept. 17 to Jan. 8 through the Wakhan Corridor.

BRUSHES WITH HUMANS

Peak elevation of Pari’s trek: 16,522 feet.

OVER THE BORDER

Pari’s 5-day Tajikistan visit, Dec. 27

to Jan. 1, was a trek of about 23 miles.
