And then Manager Bobby Valentine noticed something different in Leiter's motion as he pored over videotapes. Last season, when Leiter was pitching well, he exploded through his follow-through with his left (back) leg. Since the sprain, however, Leiter had been following through as though his back leg were tied to the pitching rubber.

Leiter was held out of a start and he experimented with a new taping method on his sore left knee. Yesterday, both Valentine and Leiter said that he had much more explosion with the leg. And Leiter -- who broke a half-dozen Cincinnati bats with his pitches -- said he did not feel unusual soreness from the new knee wrap.

But even though Edgardo Alfonzo hit a solo home run in the first and Bobby Bonilla -- in his first game back from the disabled list -- and Brian McRae belted consecutive solo homers in the second to give the Mets a 3-1 lead, Leiter could not hold it. He had escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the second with only one run allowed. But Sean Casey singled in two runs in the third to tie the game at 3-3.

And after the left-handed reliever Ron Villone came on for Brett Tomko with runners on second and third and two out in the third and threw three straight strikes past Robin Ventura (who struck out four times yesterday), the Mets did not record another hit. Villone (1-0) retired the first 12 batters he faced before walking Luis Lopez on four pitches with two out in the seventh. And then right-hander Scott Williamson came on and struck out pinch-hitter Benny Agbayani to end the threat, before pitching two more perfect innings for his sixth save.

Afterward, Valentine liked enough of what he saw of Leiter to say, ''He was four or five pitches away from having probably a complete game shutout, so we'll build on that.'' But the results were pretty much the same.

Another rough outing, another loss, another five days spent trying to explain.
