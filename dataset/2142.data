SAN ANTONIO — While the former Colorado coach Gary Barnett has expressed interest in the open Southern Methodist job, he doesn’t believe that sentiment is mutual.

At today’s Big 12 championship game as a color commentator for SportsUSA Radio, Barnett said he had not been contacted by any teams about potential jobs. He said speculation about his going to Southern Methodist had been overblown by the news media.

“All I did was express the fact that S.M.U., I felt, was an intriguing job,” Barnett said. “Then it blew up into blah, blah, blah. There really was never any interest on their part, I don’t think.”

Barnett, 61, resigned from Colorado in December 2005 after posting a 49-38 record in seven seasons. His tenure was marred by scandal.

He said it was unlikely he would be coaching next season.

“The business is crazy right now,” said Barnett, who also coached Northwestern from 1992-98. “It’s scary crazy.”

He added: “The total pressure is on winning. There aren’t level playing fields in college. There’s level playing fields in the pros, but not college. Expectations that people have around the country at almost every program are so high and yet the playing fields aren’t level for everybody. That makes it really tough.”

Still, Barnett isn’t ruling out a return to college football.

“I think at the right place, I would like to coach again,” he said. “The itch is there.”
