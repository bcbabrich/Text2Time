"I think I have the game to beat anyone," said Williams, who nonetheless made it clear she wasn't ready to predict an outcome for her second professional outing.

Despite keeping her distance from the controversy percolating around her decision to join the WTA Tour at 14, Williams has long understood that her debut would be regarded as a moment of truth, not a mere introduction.

That's why she requested that it take place in California, her home state: She could conjure up comforting memories of going undefeated here against her peers back when she was 10.

And surrounded by an entourage that included her parents, her sister, her coach, a hitting partner and the family's lawyer and accountant -- who maintained they were on hand for moral support rather than contractual assistance for the new pro -- Williams cruised through her debut with a refreshing mix of serenity and ambition.

While her father, Richard, coped with the camera crews and the news media interrogations, Williams simply went onto the court and, as the Rolling Stones played next door to a crowd of 45,000, proved her mettle to this first-round gathering of 900.

Stafford was not critical of the hysteria accompanying Williams' debut, which so far has eclipsed not only the last-ever appearance here by 38-year-old Martina Navratilova, but also overshadowed the professional debut of 16-year-old Meilen Tu, the 1994 U.S. Open junior champion, and the return to the circuit of Sanchez Vicario, the reigning French and U.S. Open champion.

"She's going to be great for women's tennis," said Stafford.

Macci, who has coached Williams since she was 11, said this positive beginning came as a relief.

"After all, she hadn't competed in three years, and when you've got a 14-year-old with the type of game Venus has, it's a little dicey: she doesn't just stand at the baseline and bang away at the ball," said Macci, who also coached Jennifer Capriati prior to her turning pro at 13. "Venus's game is probably five times more complicated than Jennifer's was at this age, and that means there's going to be more mistakes."
