In November, thousands of Afghan and foreign Taliban fighters surrendered to the Northern Alliance. Some 400 of the foreign prisoners fought a pitched battle with General Dostum's troops in the Qala Jangi fort just outside Mazar; other men taken prisoner on the outskirts of Kunduz were trucked some 180 miles west through Mazar to Shibarghan.

Many were put in sealed shipping containers and died from suffocation on the way, witnesses and survivors have said. There are also credible accounts, including from people close to General Dostum's circle and some of his own soldiers, that troops opened fire on three containers full of prisoners, killing many inside.

''It's not one or two people,'' said Feda Mohammed Iaqin, the deputy police chief in Mazar-i-Sharif. ''They killed a lot of people and everybody in the city, of every ethnicity, knows about it.'' Mr. Iaqin, an ethnic Tajik, is the brother of General Dostum's main rival in the north, Gen. Ostad Atta Muhammad, but he was confirming what is widely rumored in the city even among ethnic Uzbeks.

Senior officials in General Dostum's administration have admitted that some prisoners died after their surrender. The head of the prison, Gen. Jura Beg, said in December that about 40 prisoners had died on the journey and been buried in Dasht-i-Laili.

But Uzbek officials have denied any mass killings. Majid Rouzi, General Dostum's deputy in charge of security in the north, said he was present when prisoners were transferred for the journey to Shibarghan. ''I did not see anyone with so much as a bloody nose,'' he said. ''It is just propaganda by our enemies.,''

Turkmens living in the village of Bakaul Khorasan, just half a mile from one of the sites, said they had lived for several months with an overpowering smell from the bodies.

''A few months ago, we noticed a very bad smell,'' said Durdi Klich, 62, a farmer living in the village. ''We decided to cover the site with more earth but the soldiers would not let us and they did it themselves,'' he said in an interview this month.
