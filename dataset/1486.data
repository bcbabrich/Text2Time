Introduced on Thursday: 2011 Kia Sportage

What is it? The Sportage compact S.U.V. has been part of Kia’s lineup since 1993. (Don’t feel bad, most people never noticed it before now.) But fresh new packaging and a 176-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder (with a turbo version on the way) could put the 2011 Sportage on many shopping lists.

Is it real? Yes, but if you ever saw or drove the previous generation Sportage, you might not believe it. The all-new 2011 Sportage is further proof that the Korean automaker has made huge improvements since those humble beginnings.

What they said: “Good design should never feel forced,” said Peter Schreyer, Kia’s chief design officer, during the news conference.

What they didn’t say: Kia has not announced pricing for the Sportage, which goes on sale this fall.

What makes it tick? A 176 horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder are available, and both come mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Either engine can be had with two or four-wheel drive.

How much, how soon? Expect only a modest bump from the current 2010 Sportage base price of $16,995 when the new model goes on sale later this year. Compact S.U.V.’s, like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, cost several thousand dollars more.

How does it look? I saw the Kia Sportage for the first time during the Geneva auto show and thought I was at the wrong stand, the new model looks so much better than past efforts. A closer look in New York only slightly alters those first impressions. The 2011 Sportage looks modern, solid, and substantial.
