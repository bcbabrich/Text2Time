In the new church of American finance, the first article of faith is progress. More and more goods and services will be produced with fewer and fewer hours of labor, world without end.

Evidence in support of this belief would appear to be conclusive. First, there is the revolution in computer technology. Second, there seems to be official affirmation in the national productivity statistics.

To compute these statistics, the Labor Department divides the volume of our national economic output by the hours worked to create it. In the third and fourth quarters of 1999, the productivity of American nonfarm labor rose at annual rates of 5 percent and 6.4 percent, the fastest in years. Expectations are running strong that the next productivity report, to be released on Thursday, will be just as brilliant.

It will be a miracle if it is. If the strength of the recent productivity reports seems unbelievable, it is perhaps because they are. James Medoff, a Harvard economics professor, and Andrew Harless, an economic consultant in Needham, Mass., have uncovered deep-rooted flaws in the data. Their conclusion is that the numbers were distorted in the melee associated with the run-up to the year 2000. If they are right, as it seems apparent they are, the ''New Economy'' is about to lose some of its luster.
