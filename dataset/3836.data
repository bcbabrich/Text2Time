''Twenty-five thousand a seat?'' said Larry Gelbart, who wrote the book for the show, with Bert Shevelove. ''The original production cost $275,000. That's 11 seats for tonight.'' Mr. Gelbart said he thought the show, a slapstick, ribald riff on the value of freedom (and, in a way, monogamy), was more suitable for the Democrats than the Republicans, and particularly suitable for this President. ''When the show first was on in 1963, Time magazine called it 'a good clean dirty show,' '' he said. ''I think he enjoys a good clean dirty show.''

Intermission was omitted and some other cuts were made on the two-and-a-quarter hour show to accommodate the President's schedule. ''We got it down to about one hour, 35 minutes,'' Ms. Kelley said, ''not including ad libs.'' And of course there were some. ''Ooh, kiss me, somebody, kiss me,'' Ms. Goldberg cried at one point, in the midst of an aphrodisiac-induced fit, then stopped in mid-gyration to blow an exaggerated kiss at the special guest in the front row. And as she usually does at the start of the show, Ms. Goldberg broke character and chastised a latecomer from the stage. ''Any other night, we would have waited for you, but we got the Prez,'' she said. ''You get caught in traffic? You can talk to me. This is an interactive show.'' The late arrival responded, ''It's the President's fault,'' to which Ms. Goldberg shot back, ''I ain't touching that one.''

Monday is usually a day off for the show, and last night's special performance meant that tonight's regularly scheduled one was canceled. Happily, no tickets had been sold for tonight by the time the event was arranged, mainly because Ms. Goldberg was expected to complete her run as Pseudolus on Sunday, and until recently, when she agreed to extend her performances through July 13, tickets had been sold only through Sunday.

Ms. Goldberg, who could not be reached for comment yesterday, was instrumental in making sure last night's event happened, Ms. Kelley said. ''It's something she wanted to do,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''Whoopi is friendly with the President. And he had promised her he'd see the show, apparently.''

In any case, if the special arrangements were a hardship for the cast members and crew, who worked last night for the seventh consecutive day, no one was complaining. ''The mood at the theater has been pretty excited; come on, we're going to meet the President,'' said Ross Lehman, who plays Hysterium, another slave, a confidant of Pseudolus, who plays a significant portion of the show in drag. ''A lot of people have been doing jokes about how they want to talk to him about their taxes, but I don't think I'll bother him with that. I do have a few things to say about foreign affairs.''

It was something else that had Mr. Lehman worried, though. ''I'm going to be wearing a dress when I meet him,'' he said. ''I've been practicing my curtsy.''

Ernie Sabella, whose character, Marcus Lycus, according to the program, is ''a buyer and seller of courtesans,'' but who, in plainer lingo, runs a brothel, seemed less worried about the delicate matter of the President's well-publicized, if unproven, peccadilloes, than about other things. ''I am apprehensive about saying one line,'' he said. '' 'I have to go to the senate this morning; I'm blackmailing one of the senators.' I don't know if I'll get a big laugh, or if I'll be audited.'' (Uh-oh, Mr. Sabella, it was only a small titter.)
