Lieut. Gen. Frederick Franks Jr., who commanded the American armor that broke through to crush the Iraqi Republican Guard, strongly urged his forces today to maintain a wary vigilance even though the single entry on his headquarters bulletin board proclaimed: "Ceasefire. 0800. 28 Feb. 91."

General Franks, a 52-year-old officer who had lost his right leg in combat in the Vietnam war, offered his warnings in his first interview since his men began to play their pivotal role in the 100-hour ground war. "We have to continue to be ready and alert," he said in elaborating on the theme of preparedness that was spreading among the tens of thousands of victorious soldiers.

Sgt. Maj. Robert E. Wilson, the highest ranking noncommissioned officer in the VII Corps, said, "It's just a very dangerous time right now, the uncertainty."

Referring to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, he added: "This guy may rally some people who get across and try something stupid, I hope for his sake he doesn't. In Vietnam they just used the cease-fire to resupply."
