LOS ANGELES, Nov, 1—Twenty former executives and employes of the bankrupt Equity Funding Corporation of America and two of the company's former auditors were accused today in a 105‐count indictment handed down by a Federal grand jury.

The indictments followed a seven‐month investigation of one of the biggest business scandals in history, involving the manufacturing of an estimated $120‐million in fictitious assets and the creation through computer manipulation of some 60,000 bogus life‐insurance policies for nonexistent persons. The same defendants were named in an indictment also handed down today in DuPage, Ill., where Equity's subsidiary, the Equity Life Insurance Company, is chartered.

Heading the list of defendants is Stanley Goldbaum, the 46‐year‐old former chairman and president of Equity, and Fred Levin, 40, and Samuel B. Lowell, 34, both former executive vice presidents.

The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, filing of false documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, bank fraud, interstate transportation of securities taken by fraud, interstate transportation of counterfeit securities and electronic eavesdropping. Defendants also are charged with specific acts of commission.
