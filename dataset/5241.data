New Cardin Beachhead

The largely untapped Chinese market is the target of a new venture linking Pierre Cardin, the French designer, and Gruppo GFT, an Italian manufacturer and distributor of ready-to-wear. The plan is to manufacture and to sell in China Mr. Cardin's clothing and accessories for men, women and children, his home furnishings and his leather goods.

Mr. Cardin's name is already known in China. He showed his haute-couture collection there in 1979 and opened Maxim's restaurant in Beijing in 1983. He has also manufactured some apparel there, as has Gruppo GFT.

But just how much of a market for high fashion does China represent? ''The Chinese people like to dress,'' Mr. Cardin said by telephone from his Paris office. ''They have rejected the Mao suits. They don't like classique. They like high fashion. The clothes we will sell there will be the same as what I show in Paris. We are expecting to open 40,000 stores in China. It's a very big deal.'' Spring Hats Sprout

''This is a hat season,'' said Patricia Underwood, a millinery designer. ''We're making them as fast as we possibly can. What we've shipped for spring is selling, and we're already getting reorders.''
