My neighbors and I are very unhappy with both our co-op board and the management company. We can boot the board at the next annual meeting, but none of us concerned shareholders know how to go about changing the company who manages the building. Who even decides on this — just the board or all of the shareholders? It has not been discussed at previous annual meetings.

“By law, the business of a corporation is to be managed under the direction of the board of directors,” said Howard Schechter, a Manhattan lawyer who represents co-ops and condominiums. “This means that only the board can choose to hire a managing agent or to fire one.”

So, Mr. Schechter said, the first step for the letter writer is to make sure that the unhappy shareholders have enough votes at the annual meeting to elect a new board. “This includes choosing candidates to run, making themselves and their dissatisfactions known to the other shareholders, and urging like-minded shareholders to attend the meeting or sign proxies that can be voted for the dissident slate,” he said.

The challenging shareholders should also check the bylaws to determine the termination provisions of the management contract. “Most management contracts include a clause that allows the board to end the contract on 30 or 60 days’ notice,” he said.

Such notice should not be given until a new managing agent has been identified and a new management contract has been negotiated. “The ability of the agent to meet the cooperative’s needs should always be the No. 1 concern,” he said.
