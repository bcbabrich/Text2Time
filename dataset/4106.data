He crouched, right foot forward, bent slightly at the waist, his hands in front of him, keeping index and middle fingers on the flippers. "I'm the only one I know who uses two fingers."

IT seems to work for him. For more than an hour, he kept the steel balls in play doing what he wanted. Like the other better players, he knows the wiring of this and most other games, practically all of which are manufactured in Chicago. He knows what sequences will bring him the highest score. At times he flipped the balls from one flipper to another. He also called his shots, softly saying which ramp or hole or bumper he was going to hit, and then he did it.

"Watch this, I'm about to get into what this game calls the zone, which means that six balls are going to come out at one time," he said, and sure enough, lights started flashing as six balls began ricocheting down the sloping panel.

Later, when one ball fell between the flippers, he shook his head and declared, "That was a less than average ball." As if to motivate himself, he said: "Remember pinball is a one-ball game. One ball is all you need to get billions."

He got his billions, but he did not match the 2.4 billion he had scored on the machine some time ago to become the machine's Grand Master, with his name flashing on it every few minutes.

In fact, he had also been the Grand Master on the Shadow, another model at the arcade, but last week a player named Domenick, whom he knew, had beaten his previous high and replaced him. Apparantly Gentleman Kai was not happy about this, though he did not talk of revenge.

Still, with the crowd of spectators following him, he moved to the Shadow and dropped 50 cents to start it up. He said nothing, but you could see his intensity and desire. He flipped brilliantly with a great economy of movement. No showboating. No body English. Like DiMaggio. Like Manolete. When he passed four billion, the machine's voice announced that he was again its highest-scoring player. It invited him to write his name in place of Domenick.

Though he did not exult, you could see he felt good. He was focused, concentrating on the games ahead this wekeend when he would be going up against all those people coming to his turf from all the major malls in the world. He was ready.
