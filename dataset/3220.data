''I don't care, really,'' said a 23-year-old vendor who gave his name only as Aleksei. ''The only real thing is that the dollar will go up. And that's all I think.''

Mr. Putin's popularity ratings have shot up in the last two months, as Russian soldiers have prosecuted what the military and much of the media have portrayed as a successful war against rebels in Chechnya. The party that he supported in parliamentary elections 12 days ago has emerged as the most likely commander of a majority in parliament's lower house. Yet today, even those who applauded the sheer political skill of Mr. Yeltsin's move to make an all-powerful queen of his erstwhile pawn were not prepared to commit themselves to Mr. Putin, although almost everyone seemed to agree that he would be the next president.

For Mr. Yeltsin, the resignation and how he announced it on television, ''is an absolutely wonderful move,'' Yelena Rubinchik, 55, a retired engineer, said.

''I think it was planned long ago,'' Ms. Rubinchik said. ''It's politically well thought through. It's done so it seems like Yeltsin's own initiative, not made under any pressure. I liked his speech, apologizing. It made him seem sympathetic, and politically he's managed to make it seem a change, without change.''

By the time of the presidential elections, ''everybody will be occupied with other problems, and Yeltsin's family will be safe,'' she predicted, alluding to a widespread belief that Mr. Yeltsin's family and associates have used his spell in the Kremlin to enrich themselves in ways that probably broke laws and could be prosecuted by a successor.

Ms. Rubinchik was one of the few Russians who pondered Mr. Yeltsin's legacy, saying: ''His historical value will be understood in time. In my view, he made two big mistakes, the war in Chechnya and not banning the Communist Party when he could have. But he was a reformer. It's very Russian not to appreciate the person who brings change until long afterward.''

Aleksandr Sharandak definitely had other things on his mind besides politics. He was, he said, among the 40 percent of Russians who did not vote in the parliamentary elections. ''For me,'' Mr. Sharandak, 33, said, ''time is literally money. If I hadn't worked that day, I really wouldn't even be able to put the bread on the table'' for his wife and two children.
