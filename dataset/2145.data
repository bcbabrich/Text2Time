MORGANTOWN, W. Va. — For West Virginia, the most important fan among the 60,000 in attendance tonight will be Terrelle Pryor, a Pennsylvania high school quarterback. He’s the consensus No. 1 player in the country and seemingly an ideal fit for the Mountaineers’ spread offense. Pryor is most often compared to the former Texas quarterback Vince Young and has narrowed the list of universities recruiting him to Ohio State, West Virginia, Florida, Penn State and Tennessee.

In this interesting diary in The Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Pryor talks about how he’s rooting for W.V.U. and O.S.U. to play in the title game. Pryor is 6-foot-6, 225 pounds and as prolific a thrower as he is a runner. He was scheduled to play in a playoff game this afternoon for Jeannette High School and make it in time for kickoff.

The West Virginia staff couldn’t have scripted a better environment for Pryor’s visit. The atmosphere here is expected to be the best in the history of the state. If you don’t believe the hype on Pryor, pick your poison on these You Tube clips. You don’t need to be Tom Lemming to see Pryor’s boundless potential.
