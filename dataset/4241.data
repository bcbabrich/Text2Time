A string of opening scenes capture the vinegary essence of Hickok's nature, whether he's shooting a shot glass off a dog's head for target practice or decimating those foolish enough to trifle with his hat. (Later on, duly famous, Wild Bill sports a grandly handsome hat that leaves no question about his status.) When told that a man accuses him of having sexually molested a horse, Hickok responds with the sang-froid for which he is so admired. "He say what horse?" Wild Bill calmly inquires.

One of the film's accomplishments is in revealing Hickok's tender side without compromising that appealing gruffness or developing a mile-wide sentimental streak. Something that comes to puzzle him, late in his relatively short life, is his failure with women. But the source of that failure (as illustrated through flashbacks with a radiant Diane Lane) is Wild Bill's own cruelty, which the film regards as fundamental to his character. For audiences who like their heroes neat and resolute, the chanciest aspect of "Wild Bill" is its refusal to tame this man's raging contradictions.

Convinced that the loss of a figure this outsized should matter to us all, "Wild Bill" watches the fans and challengers who surround the great man in his final days. "Awful lot of people want a piece of Wild Bill," Hickok himself dryly acknowledges. Jack McCall (David Arquette) was a boy when Wild Bill ruined his mother's life, and now he wants to even the score. Calamity Jane (played ebulliently by Ellen Barkin, with a bullwhip and a Jean Arthur twang) adores Bill and would do anything to save him. Charley Prince (John Hurt) is the quintessential Friend of Bill, watching the Hickok legend take shape and voicing some of the film's endless foreboding. "This town, I really think it's like something out of the Bible," Charley says, when the story settles down in the rollicking Gold Rush town of Deadwood, S. D.

"What part of the Bible?" Bill asks.

"The part right before God gets angry."

When Mr. Hill presents Marjoe Gortner as Deadwood's overheated preacher and shows Bill listening to him hopelessly outside the ranks of the faithful, the film indeed seems to be playing out a biblical sense of doom. Another of those expediting it is James Remar, steely as ever and offering a good idea of how Harrison Ford would look if he ever took up villainous roles. Also on hand are Bruce Dern as an early Hickok victim (Bill is happy to kill a man in a wheelchair if he himself is also chairbound) and Christina Applegate, as a prostitute who calmly shoots a man for making a pass at her in a whorehouse. Among the film's many hard-bitten characters, only Wild Bill's actual killer lacks nerves of steel.

The film's energetic but unsteady visual style encompasses muddy shots of Deadwood and skewed, haunting flashbacks in bleached-out black and white. Van Dyke Parks provides suitably eerie musical accompaniment, giving classic cowboy melodies and folk songs a ghostly ring. However, using "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" to accompany a barroom sex scene is not one of the film's better ideas.
