Guess who I saw online last week in the first-class smoking room on the A-deck of the Virtual Titanic? Leonardo DiCaprio, no less. He was standing with his back to me, contemplating a blazing hearth, a brandy in one hand, an unlighted cigarette in the other. When he turned, I noticed he wasn't wearing his costume from the movie ''Titanic'' -- just jeans and a Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt under a life jacket.

''Gotta light?'' he asked.

Leonardo happens to be my own private little nicotine dream. But the first-class smoking room of the Virtual Titanic is open to all -- on the Internet. It was in this room that the rich and powerful Edwardians were enjoying cigars and nightcaps when the liner collided with the iceberg in April 1912. Ask your search engine to seek ''Titanic Online, Virtual Titanic,'' and you can be there, too. Using special software (to be downloaded at the site), you can pan, tilt and zoom around, taking in the carved mahogany paneling with mother-of-pearl inlay, the lofty stained-glass windows and the glowing fireplace.

(The cabin and tourist classes had their own smoking rooms down below, but I always go first class. If you can no longer smoke, I tell myself, at least do it in style.)

For someone like me, a recovering nicotine fiend who once smoked in the shower (through a hole in the curtain -- don't ask), virtual smoking rooms are the only retreats still allowed (unless you count obvious places, like Bette Davis movies). It's been five years since I stubbed out my last cigarette, and I have no idea where to find a serious public smoking room these days. At least not in New York, which now seems to be the Street-Smoking Capital of the World.
