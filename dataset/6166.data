MOSCOW, March 1—Prime Minister Aleksei N. Kosygin asserted today that the Soviet Union had made important gains in its economic competition with capitalism.

In a detailed economic report to the 25th Communist Party Congress at the Kremlin, Mr. Kosygin said that the Soviet Union now produced more steel, oil, mineral fertilizers, pig iron, coal, cement, tractors, cotton, wool and other commodities than any other country.

He said that during the last five years, Soviet industrial output had grown at an average annual rate of 7.4 percent, compared with what he said was a 1.2 percent annual rate in the United States and European Common Market countries. [The 1.2 percent figure was called “roughly correct” by Government and business sources in the United States.]

The crisis of capitalism, he said, was marked by inflation and unemployment, in contrast with the Soviet Union's full employment and stable retail prices.
