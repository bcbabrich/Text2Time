The Prime Minister, who opened this Pandora's box a week ago by resigning as party leader and running in a new election, returned Wednesday from a two-day European Union summit meeting in Cannes, France. He promptly ensconced himself in the tearoom and his office next door, meeting with Tory M.P.'s one by one, at the rate of one every 15 minutes, to extract promissory notes.

While he was away, Mr. Major ceded the spotlight to his declared challenger, a 44-year-old right-winger and recent Cabinet member named John Redwood. He also ceded the tearoom. When Mr. Redwood walked into it on Tuesday, he was given a rousing cheer, which was heartening to him until he realized that those applauding were from the opposition Labor Party, delighted at the internecine warfare among their rivals.

Mr. Redwood is widely said to be intelligent -- he headed a policy unit for Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister -- but he has an automatonlike persona. The press has been having a field day with this but it must be said that Mr. Redwood has been giving them material to work with.

At his first news conference, he made light of his nickname, Vulcan, after the Star Trek character Spock. "I can now see the joke, although as you know it took me a long time to work it out," he said. "The logic cells have now managed to get around to it, and I now realize that it was funny all along."

Noon on Thursday was the deadline for challengers to register for the July 4 election, in which the 329 Tory M.P.'s vote. Mr. Redwood's is the only hat in the ring, but several other hats are off their heads, ready to be pitched in for a second ballot on July 11. A second ballot is mandated if Mr. Major fails to get a majority (165 votes) and also if he fails to beat his opponent by at least 50 votes, or 15 percent of the total number of Tory M.P.'s.
