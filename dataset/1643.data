TAMPA, Fla. â€” Larry Fitzgerald and Santonio Holmes are fast, but working on the Super Bowl sideline can require quick feet, too.

Late in the fourth quarter, four men walked onto the field carrying a black gym bag full of Steelers victory caps and T-shirts. But when Fitzgerald raced 64 yards to put the Cardinals ahead, 23-20, with 2 minutes 37 seconds to go, the men sprinted back into the stadium tunnel. Moments later they returned with Cardinals victory gear.

They got another workout when Holmes scored the winning touchdown with 35 seconds to go, running back down the tunnel and into a closet to fetch the bags a third time.
