Senior Administration economics officials began today to pare their list of 15 to 20 possible nominees to replace Wayne D. Angell as a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, Administration officials said this evening.

President Clinton is expected to nominate Alan S. Blinder, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, to replace David Mullins, who was the Fed's vice chairman until his resignation in early February. Administration officials are now interested in finding a woman or a member of a minority group to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Angell's recent retirement. The White House and Treasury have assembled a list of such nominees, said officials who insisted on anonymity.

The Administration is beginning to call possible candidates to see if they are interested in the Fed job, one of the officials said.

One person on the current list is Marcus Alexis, an economics professor at Northwestern University and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, two officials said. Mr. Alexis, who is black, has written mostly about economic development issues in inner cities and very little about broader economic issues. In a brief interview this evening, he declined to characterize his monetary policy views or discuss his candidacy for the Fed.
