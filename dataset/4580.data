When RUTH GRUBER was in the Soviet Arctic as a foreign correspondent for The New York Herald Tribune in 1936, she interviewed a 104-year-old Yakut woman who berated her for not being married. The woman warned, "Don't wait too long," Mrs. Gruber recalled the other day. "She brought out a birch-bark cradle, which had its own irrigation system and in which she had carried her 20 children, and insisted I take it," Ms. Gruber said. "She sounded just like my own mother, and I wondered had I traveled 11,000 miles to find another Jewish mother."

Seventeen years later and married, Ms. Gruber had a daughter, Celia Michaels, and two years later a son, David Michaels; the cradle was used for both.

Now Ms. Gruber has her bags ready to go to London as soon as she hears from her daughter, a television producer and videotape editor who is due to give birth. And what will she take with her? "That birch-bark cradle, of course."
