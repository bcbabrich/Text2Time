TOUHEY--Carl E. A lifelong Albany businessman, passed away on August 25th 2013 at the remarkable age of 95. Born in 1917 to Winifred and Charles Touhey, he was a graduate of the Albany Academy and Princeton University (1939). He ran a stunning race for Mayor of Albany in 1973 almost defeating the notorious Albany democratic machine. He was the President of Orange Motor Company, which was founded by his father, Charles, on Friday the 13th 1916. Carl always chuckled at that date, adding, "And we're still standing, still strong!" For over 75 years his various businesses provided employment for hundreds of Albany area families. A passionate philanthropist, he felt the responsibility to give back to his community. When asking others to do the same, he had an interesting strategy. He would say "How can I get big bucks from this guy? First I need to set the tone by stepping up myself." And he did. Some of his favorite organizations were more traditional ones such as Albany Medical Center, The College of Saint Rose, and Saratoga Performing Arts Center. But he also cared about smaller organizations like Capital Region Sponsor a Scholar and the 15 Love Youth Program both of which directly serve families in the community. He will be greatly missed by his wife, Nancy, and his children, Charles, John, Lila Marie, Virginia, their spouses, as well as the mother of his children, Lila L. Touhey, and seven grandchildren and great grandchildren. Predeceased by his sister, Alice, and his brother, Frank, Carl was a surrogate father to their children as well as Nancy's many children and grandchildren. Contributions may be made to Capital Region Sponsor a Scholar Albany, NY or The Achievement Center for Children and Families, Delray Beach, FL.
