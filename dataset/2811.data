To the Editor:

Re ''Prosecutors Fight DNA Use for Exoneration'' (front page, Aug. 29): The arguments used in court papers by a Florida prosecutor to discount the impact of DNA evidence in the case of a convicted rapist are disturbing.

The interest in ''finality'' that he cites as a reason for the conviction to stand should, in fact, encourage him to seek the truth, as should his concern for the victim.

Evidence that was used to convict a defendant does not become meaningless when DNA testing shows that it no longer fits the prosecution's case. Shouldn't a jury in a retrial decide whether or not a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt can be reached without it?

The prosecutor appears to feel that the inconvenience of another trial far outweighs the inconvenience of continuing to imprison an innocent man. Our justice system becomes both ineffective and dangerous once the actual guilt or innocence of those we lock away becomes irrelevant.
