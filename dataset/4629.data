More than any other initiative taken by Tokyo in the postwar era, the peacekeeping bill has become the symbol of how far Japan is willing to go in fulfilling its pledges to take a greater political role in world affairs, one that would be more commensurate with its economic might.

But as the debate unfolded, it became clear that many of Japan's leaders envision a far more active, risky role than do many of its citizens, who see little advantage in dispensing with the postwar prohibition on sending forces abroad. Under most current interpretations of the Constitution, which was written by the American occupying force here after Japan's surrender, the country's Self-Defense Forces are strictly prohibited from venturing beyond Japan's shores or engaging in acts of "collective security."

Since the gulf war, when Japan contributed $12 billion but no personnel to the multinational force that liberated Kuwait, debate has raged here over whether the post-cold-war era requires a fundamental change in Japanese policy.

Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declared passage of the bill one of his top priorities, and many political analysts here believe that his tenure may depend on how skillfully he secures its passage without harming his party's chances in a critical election this summer. Many political leaders here also consider passage a prerequisite if Japan hopes to realize its ambitions to become a member of the United Nations Security Council in coming years. Public Is Opposed

Nonetheless, polls show that the Japanese public is clearly opposed to any plan to send its troops into combat areas, with many questioning whether they can yet trust their Government to keep a rein on the military. As a result, the governing party -- fearful that its efforts to pass some kind of peacekeeping bill could be defeated for a third time -- has been struggling for ways to pass the core elements of the bill, while at the same time at least seeming to be responsive to the public's apprehensions. And it is possible the fragile coalition being built around the bill could still collapse, perhaps leading to the dissolution of both houses of Parliament and the calling of a general election.
