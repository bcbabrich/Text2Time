On this they agreed: after decades of devoted, even life-saving work, Covenant House is suffering an unjust damage to its reputation. But in the wake of the Rev. Bruce Ritter's decision to leave the organization he founded, staff members and residents were divided on other questions.

Should he have resigned? Has Covenant House's work begun to suffer? Could the organization bounce back from the accusations of financial and sexual wrongdoing surrounding him? It depended on whom you asked. ''Bruce should have resigned,'' said Lester Pineda, a resident, as he took a break from working out with the punching bags in the Convenant House gym at Ninth Avenue and 17th Street. ''He was getting too much press.'' 'As Smooth as Always'

Mr. Pineda said when residents now tell people that they are from Covenant House they ''look at you different.''

But Raymond Wilkes, who recently left the Covenant House shelter on West 41st Street, disagreed.

''He's making himself look guilty,'' Mr. Wilkes said. ''He had the counselors behind him and the residents. By pulling away like this he's showing the kids what it's like to be weak.''
