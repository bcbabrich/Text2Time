The company said effective May 1, 1986, it began capitalizing certain software development costs in accordance with FAS No. 86, ''Accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.'' In periods prior to May 1, 1986, such costs were expensed; during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 30, 1987, $121,000 and $1,139,000 of such costs were capitalized, respectively, net of amortization. The company also said the effect of this accounting change had no effect on share earnings in the latest fourth quarter, and increased share earnings by 3 cents a share for the latest fiscal year. The accounting required by Statement No. 86 is prospective; thus the earnings in periods prior to May 1, 1986, have not been restated.
