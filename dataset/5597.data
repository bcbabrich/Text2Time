Federal officials say that rabies is now widespread in Maryland and Pennsylvania, and they fear its steady advance will reach the suburbs of Philadelphia in a year. The same outbreak of the disease has also reached epidemic proportions in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

The East Coast epidemic is one of two in the country. Another, carried by skunks, has spread the disease from Texas north to Minnesota and from Kentucky west to the Dakotas, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In addition, rabies is common in bats in much of the country.

There were 5,599 confirmed cases of rabid animals in the country last year, according to the centers, more than twice the 2,675 reported in 1975. So far this year, 2,382 cases have been reported, which the Centers for Disease Control said was slightly ahead of last year's rate.

Dr. Fishbein attributed part of the rise, however, to better reporting and record-keeping.

As the disease spreads into more densely populated areas, however, contact between rabid animals and humans is becoming increasingly common. These are among recent incidents:

* A 15-year-old girl was bitten in the leg in March by a raccoon while sitting on her porch in Hanover, Pa.

* More than 30 people were exposed when they played with a rabid kitten on two farms in Frederick County, Md. The kitten also bit a New Jersey woman at a gift shop, through her boot. Health officials conducted a vast but unsuccessful search for the woman, whose name was not known to the officials.

* A 6-year-old boy was bitten by a groundhog while waiting for a school bus in York County.

* An 87-year-old man was bitten by the family's pet donkey in central Pennsylvania. The man and all emergency room personnel who helped treat his deep wound had to be vaccinated.

Such incidents have caused alarm in the region's tiny towns, whose residents rarely vaccinate their pets and often allow them to roam. Local officials report an increase in the number of abandoned animals and at least one case of what they described as ''panic.'' Group Forms to Get Cat
