Within the theater world, the question of who will succeed Gerald Schoenfeld, the longtime chairman of the Shubert Organization and probably the most influential figure on Broadway, after his death last week has all the high drama and mystery of a seat-gripping whodunit. Tuesday night the board of directors will announce, if not whodunit, then whoisit, Phil Smith, the president of the Shubert Organization, said. The board will meet and “implement the succession plan,” he said. Until then, guessing is encouraged.
