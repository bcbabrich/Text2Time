Even the presidential debates are such a throwback to the Eisenhower era that the networks might as well broadcast them in black and white. The PBS anchor Jim Lehrer was not chosen to moderate all three presidential contests, as he has been in the past. He was assigned only the first debate in Florida. The next two will be presided over by other aging, white males: Charles Gibson of ABC and Bob Schieffer of CBS, the only two network news anchors who make Mr. Lehrer seem kooky. (Gwen Ifill, who is female and black, will moderate the less important vice presidential debate.)

This season no new sitcoms are centered on a female character. NBC has a "Friends" spinoff, "Joey," starring Matt LeBlanc; ABC has "Rodney," based on the good-old-boy humor of the country-western comic Rodney Carrington; and CBS has "Center of the Universe," starring John Goodman -- without Roseanne Barr. HBO, always a trendsetter, introduced a no-girls-allowed series this summer, "Entourage," about a young Hollywood actor and his posse, that was one long, admittedly funny bachelor party.

Meanwhile, comedy-variety shows are positively reveling in their new-found freedom to be unfair.

The jokes at comedy roasts are almost always disparaging on the basis of race, creed or sex, but until recently, networks tried to sit up straight during the family hour. NBC's "Last Comic Standing" lets amateur stand-up comedians vent the kind of material at 8 p.m. that is usually left to late-hour improv nights in comedy clubs. On a recent episode the contenders taunted a heavy-set, black female contestant with weight and race jokes. (One said she could not eat Tootsie Rolls because she might bite off her own fingers.)

Not surprisingly, then, strong female characters are also having a dry spell on the new season's dramas. The networks have no new police series like "Cold Case" or "Crossing Jordan" this fall. The only new hard-boiled female detective is a high school student, Veronica Mars, on UPN. Heather Locklear shares top billing with Blair Underwood on NBC's airport drama "LAX," but, bless her heart, she is still more bimbo than Rambo.

The antifeminist mood is widespread, particularly on reality shows like "The Apprentice" and "Wife Swap," where single career women are cute and flirty and married women do housework. But it is most noticeable on sitcoms because it was not long ago that the genre was dominated by strong, funny women and especially by strong, funny women who made fun of men, from "Roseanne" and "Murphy Brown" to "Ally McBeal" and "Sex and the City."
