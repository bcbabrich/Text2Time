The court ordered that the Senate and Assembly be reapportioned on the basis of the “one man, one vote” decision. It directed that a temporary plan for compliance be adopted bystatute in time for the 1965 legislative elections and suggested that a statewide convention be convened to effect a permanent plan in time for the legislative elections of 1967.

The Senate is now and traditionally has been composed of one member from each of New Jersey's 21 counties. The 60 Assembly seats are apportioned according to population, except that each county is entitled to at least one seat.

Mr. Hughes, in his message, had proposed the creation of a 16-member commission to devise an interim plan for compliance with the court edict in 1965. He had asked that he be permitted to name at least eight members of that body.

He had further suggested that a statewide convention be convened to formulate a permanent remedy for the dilemma. But, he had urged the delegates to the convention not be elected until early in 1966 to remove the all‐important matter from the partisan political campaigns of 1965.

Mr. Hughes had called the lawmakers into special session today to deal with the problem. While the legislators agreed to resume their deliberations at this time, they denied the right of the Governor to order a special session inasmuch as the Legislature was only in recess and had not adjourned sine die.

Mr. Hughes offered no specific plan of his own for either a temporary or a permanent solution to the districting dilemma. But he insisted that, as Governor, he had the right, along with the public, to participate in evolving such solutions.

He urged that the problem be removed from partisan politics and that weighted voting, as an answer to reapportionment, be rescinded.
