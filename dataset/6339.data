With the career individual scoring record tucked away, Pete Maravich can now turn his sights to rolling up enough points to keep a mediocre Lou isiana State basketball team winning.

In the three seasons Mara vich has put L.S.U. on the national basketball map, his traveling scoring circus has never come to New York. Play ing here is a goal he has long held, but a National Invitation Tournament bid hinges on the Tigers posting a respectable record. Last March, the N.I.T. committee turned down L.S.U. because of a 14‐12 won‐lost record.

With 11 remaining games in the Southeastern Conference, L.S.U. scored its 10th victory in 15 games Saturday night by defeating Mississippi, 109‐ 86. Maravich scored 53 points, 13 more than he needed to break the scoring record of 2,973 amassed by Oscar Robertson at the University of Cincinnati from 1957–60. Pete has 2,987.

As the home capacity crowd of 11,000 chanted, “One more, one more,” when he came close to the record, Maravich dazzled 'Ole Miss with his fa mous push‐shot jumpers, head fakes and moving crossover dribbles under his legs. Mara vich also had 12 assists.
