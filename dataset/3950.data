According to the transcript, released by the White House today, Mrs. Clinton answered many questions by saying she could not recall details of her work 11 years ago on the real estate deal, which has been deemed by Federal regulators to have been a sham transaction.

But the Pillsbury report said none of the newly discovered evidence suggested that Mrs. Clinton or other Rose firm lawyers were aware of the fraud.

The report focused on the law firm's help in the Castle Grande deal, which was a transfer between Madison Guaranty and Seth Ward, an Arkansas political figure who is also the father-in-law of Webster L. Hubbell. Mr. Hubbell was a senior partner with Mrs. Clinton in the Rose firm and served in the Clinton Administration as the No. 3 official in the Justice Department. He is currently serving a prison term for defrauding his partners at the law firm.

Mrs. Clinton prepared one of the documents involved in the land transfer, according to other records.

The report said that although Mrs. Clinton prepared the May 1986 document, "nothing proves she did so knowing it to be wrong. The circumstances of the work point strongly toward innocent explanations."

The Pillsbury lawyers said Mr. Ward and Mr. McDougal probably worked on the land transfer, without involving others, except perhaps for Mr. Hubbell. And the report portrays Mr. McDougal as an unreliable person who sought to associate himself with the Clintons for prestige.

The Clintons, the report said, were not "cronies" of Mr. McDougal but people he wanted to claim as friends. "Sitting on the periphery of politics, McDougal wanted to be known as someone who had friends in high places," the lawyers wrote. "In the Clintons' case, he wanted to say something like this: 'They are friends of mine. We go way back.' "
