Novelists will say that one reason their work is so agonizing is that no one out there is waiting for what they do; they have to create their own welcome in the world.

A cross-country bicyclist feels much the same way.

For a New Yorker heading home on two wheels from the West Coast, the nation looms Tolstoyan. O.K., maybe that's inappropriate; maybe Melvillian is better. Or Hemingwayesque. Epic, anyway.

Epic or short story, beginnings are always a problem, but how is this for the height of inauspiciousness? Somewhere between New York and Oakland, Calif., where bicycle and bicyclist were to be reunited after a Westward journey by rail, Amtrak lost the bike.

This is something that never happens, said Gary L. Rose, the Amtrak official in charge of baggage and ticketing for Northern California. Occasionally packages are delayed, he said, or sometimes a parcel gets mistakenly rerouted to an improper destination. "But I don't know how that happens with something as big as a bike," Mr. Rose said.
