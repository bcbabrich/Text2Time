AGGRESSIVE-GROWTH stock funds may be bloodied, but they remain unbowed.

Despite the pounding most took in July, top-performing aggressive-growth funds are still providing investors with decent double-digit returns this year. Not only was the average 14 percent decline experienced earlier this summer not enough to wipe out their big gains of the first half, but in August -- thanks to some respectable earnings that lifted stock prices and some fortuitous stock-picking -- many regained their footing and are now keeping pace with the overall market for the year.

Make no mistake, there is still evidence of the injuries from the midsummer rout, which largely affected technology and health care stocks. The damage is seen not only in the funds' relative performance but also in the wounded psyches of this group's portfolio managers. ''It was like a battleship pulled up and was firing salvos at us every day,'' said John Cabell, co-manager of the USAA Aggressive Growth fund. In mid-July, his fund was 20 percent off its May high, but it regained some of that ground in August.

''We're all carrying the hangover,'' said Richard Little, a general partner at GMC Seneca Capital Management, which runs the Citizens Emerging Growth fund. ''People who manage aggressive portfolios now carry a fear factor that will affect prices for at least two to three quarters.''

Aggressive-growth stock funds invest mostly in small and midsize companies whose earnings are expected to grow rapidly. Such companies tend to sell at prices that reflect these expectations, giving them high price-to-earnings ratios.
