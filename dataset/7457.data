KANSAS CITY, May 31 —Poor relief pitching by Hal Reniff cost the New York Yankess a 4‐2 defeat and the deciding game of a three‐game series with the Kansas City Atlileties today in a game delayed and interrupted by rain.

Asked to protect a freshly acquired 2‐1 lead in the seventh inning, Reniff retired the first two men but walked the next two, a major relief‐pitching sin. Then he yielded a three‐run home run to Wayne Causey, a good hitter but not known for his power. This was his second homer of the season.

Another of Mickey Mantle's dramatic pinch hits was nullified by Causey's homer, which sailed over the “One‐Half Pennant Porch” and landed on the embankment where sheep graze.

Mantle had appeared in the top half of the seventh when the Yankees were trailing, 1—0. Joe Pepitone had singled with two out, and Clete Boyer had topped a roller toward third for another hit.
