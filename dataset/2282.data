Eliot Spitzer reported raising $730,000 during the last couple of weeks, while Tom Suozzi raised $212,000.

Their bank accounts are even more lopsided: while Team Spitzer says it has $12.1 million in the bank, Team Suozzi says it has only a little over $1 million. That did not stop the Suozzi campaign from making a $350 donation to the John J. Fuchs charitable trust. There are also a few expenditures at CVS: no word on whether any of it was for aspirin.
