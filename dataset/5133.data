Danny Jackson, the Cincinnati Reds' left-hander who made a spectacular debut in the National League last year with a 23-8 record, underwent shoulder surgery yesterday and is through for the season.

Dr. Warren Harding, the Reds' team physician, performed arthroscopic surgery on Jackson's pitching shoulder to trim frayed tissue.

Jackson had been placed on the disabled list July 25 because of shoulder problems. He had previously been on the disabled list June 18-July 6 because of shoulder and wrist ailments, and he had been troubled by a toe injury this season.

He had a record of 6-11 this season with a 5.60 earned run average in 20 games, all starts.(AP)
