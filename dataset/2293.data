Less than two minutes before, the Texas A&M kicker Layne Neumann connected on a go-ahead 32-yard field goal.

Texas Tech (4-1) has now won five of its last six games against Texas A&M (4-1).

"The character that it takes to engineer a comeback like this is big," Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach said. "It's very gratifying."

Harrell completed 32 of 45 passes for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns, three of which were to Johnson. During the game-winning drive, he was 5 of 7 for 75 yards and Texas Tech had a fourth-down conversion inside its 40-yard line.

On his last touchdown, Harrell said he recognized the blitz and called an audible for Johnson to run a streak pattern instead of a slant.

"Graham was calm out there the whole time," Johnson said. "He reminds me of Tom Brady."

The Aggies' last-minute meltdown Saturday is likely to turn up the heat on Franchione, who is paid an annual salary of $2 million. He is a woeful 1-3 versus the Red Raiders, an unacceptable mark for a football-rich school that considers Texas its biggest rival and that expects to be a national power.

"This game is not the end to all wherewithal whether we had won the game or lost the game," Franchione said. "There's more critical important games to play."

On a sun-baked day in which temperatures hovered near 90 degrees, the Aggie defense reverted back to old habits Saturday under first-year defensive coordinator Gary Darnell.

Ranked 107th in total defense last year, Texas A&M was inept defensively in the early going. The Red Raiders feasted, rolling up 297 of their 433 offensive yards in the first half for a 24-14 halftime lead.

Yet until Saturday's last-minute collapse, the Aggies played better defensively in the second half, allowing them to rally behind a ground attack that compiled 250 yards.

Of that, sophomore Jorvorskie Lane pounded out 77 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries.

Texas A&M tied the game at 24-24 on a 4-yard run by the junior fullback Chris Alexander with 8:44 left. The Aggies then grabbed the lead on Neumann's second field goal, but then came Texas Tech's late heroics.

"We had a maximum blitz and someone failed to make it maximum," said Darnell of the game-winning play.

The epitome of college football's hot coach when he arrived at Texas A&M in December 2002, Franchione has thus far been unable to replicate his makeover magic in previous stops at Alabama, Texas Christian and New Mexico.

The Aggies are 20-20 during his four-year tenure and have advanced to the postseason only once. R.C. Slocum, whom Franchione replaced, was 21-15 in his last three years and led Texas A&M to bowl appearances in each of those seasons.

Although Texas A&M entered Saturday undefeated, its record was somewhat misleading.

Its four victories have come against teams that entering Saturday were a combined 6-11 this season. One of those wins included stopping Army just short of the end zone on the game's final play to escape with a 28-24 win.

Nearly an hour after Saturday's game, the final score remained on some of Kyle Field's scoreboards as jubilant Texas Tech fans congregated near the Red Raider locker room.

The Aggies must still play Oklahoma, Nebraska and at Texas.

Although Franchione wouldn't admit it, Saturday's loss was clearly a setback for him and A&M.

"It's tough," he said.
