BASRA, Iraq, Dec. 24— “Yedfaa, yedfaa, yedfaa,” workmen chanted this week as they wrestled great piles of crates into riverboats bound toward the Persian Gulf—“push, push.”

It is date‐packing time in this southern Iraqi port, a time of furious activity be cause Basra is the city from where most of the world's dates are shipped.

Iraq contends her 32 mil lion date palms provide three quarters of the world's sup ply. The bulk of the crop passes through Basra, which lies on the Shatt al Arab, 75 miles up from the gulf.

After untold centuries of date growing, the date indus try has become an integral part of life in southern Iraq.
