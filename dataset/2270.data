Citing a telecom newsletter and a Paris-based analyst, Reuters reported Tuesday that Alcatel is in talks with Nortel Networks, its Canadian rival, to acquire its high-speed mobile arm. Such a deal would be worth 1.51 billion euro ($1.91 billion), Reuters said.

The French telecom giant has only a few months to seal a deal, before it seals its merger with U.S. rival Lucent at the end of this year. Any deal with Nortel would face far higher hurdles after the Lucent tie-up is complete.

“We are open to all options that would allow us to boost our presence in that technology,” Alcatel told Reuters without confirming the talks. A Nortel spokesman said the company declined comment.

The talks have arisen only two weeks after Nortel unveiled a four-year partnership with Microsoft, focusing on Internet calling and video and instant messaging. Before that, Nortel was seen as the odd man out in an industry that had been brimming with tie-ups, including those between Ericsson and Marconi and Nokia and Siemens.

Previous items on DealBook noted speculation on possible partners for Nortel, including Motorola, Cisco, China’s Huawei and, yes, Alcatel.

Oddo, a French brokerage, said an Alcatel-Nortel deal would make sense, as a combined Alcatel-Lucent would have only 6 percent of the market for high-speed cellular equipment. And Sam Greenholtz, an analyst with Telecom Pragmatics, told TheStreet.com: “Nortel has been looking to focus more to the IP market. And Alcatel could really use the wireless technology. It would give them a chance to win back customers that they had lost.”
