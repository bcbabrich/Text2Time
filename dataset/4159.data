About 300 Uruguayan infantrymen, some carrying guitars and tea-making kits, arrived here today, the first contingent of United Nations peacekeepers to assume duty in Africa's most persistent civil war.

It is the second attempt by the United Nations to resolve the Angolan war.

Rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola signed a peace treaty with the Government last November to end the conflict, which started on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 and has killed some 600,000 Angolans.

But the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, refused to commit peacekeepers until the hostile forces pulled back from their battle lines and the rebel chief Jonas Savimbi met with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos for a public handshake.

Battalions from India, Zimbabwe, Brazil and Romania are to arrive in coming weeks.
