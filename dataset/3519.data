For Waffles and Pancakes Picasso Would Love

Six maple trees growing upside down in an art installation in the courtyard of Mass MOCA, the new modern art museum in North Adams, Mass., are the inspiration for, but not the source of, a new maple syrup sold in the gift shop. Appropriately enough, it's called Upside Down Maple Syrup. In a display there, a can of it is suspended from wires much the way the trees have been since spring.

The installation, ''Tree Logic,'' is by Natalie Jeremijenko, an Australian experimental artist. The trees -- flame maples, not sugar maples -- are expected to be on display for at least a couple of years, with their roots in big buckets of earth. The idea is to see how the branches and leaves will grow.

As for the syrup, the only unusual thing is the label. It's good grade-A amber syrup from the Berkshires, excellent on pancakes or even to sweeten an upside-down cake. An eight-ounce tin is $9.95, with the proceeds benefiting the museum (shipping is $3). To order: (413) 664-4481.

Instant Coffee, Real Flavor

A serious java-head has little use for instant coffee. The convenience is usually not worth the compromise in flavor and aroma. But a new instant coffee, Samba, from Brazil, is an exception. It is a blend of robusta and arabica beans and has enough full-bodied richness and true coffee aroma to make for a reasonably satisfying cup. It's excellent for recipes that call for coffee, liquid or powdered. With a small jar tucked into a carry-on bag, you have the makings for a good cup of coffee on a plane. A two-ounce jar is $2.45 at A.&P. supermarkets. Waldbaum's and Pathmark are some other chains that sell it.
