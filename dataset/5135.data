A New Jersey state trooper, an Atlantic City police officer and eight others have been indicted on charges of operating an alleged cocaine ring, state officials said today.

The defendants reportedly conspired to distribute cocaine in Atlantic and Gloucester Counties and in New York City between January 1985 and May 1988, said Attorney General Peter N. Perretti.

The state trooper, Kyle M. Anderson, 26 years old, of Clermont, and the Atlantic City police officer, Michael T. Stewart, age not given, of Atlantic City, were charged in the alleged conspiracy and have been suspended from their jobs, Mr. Perretti said.

Trooper Anderson has been a state trooper for two years and Officer Stewart is a six-year member of the Atlantic City Police Department.
