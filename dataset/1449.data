The Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Offenbach’s “Contes d’Hoffmann” stirred up heated debate within opera circles for the company’s decision to present a version of the score that fails to take into account recent research into the sources for this compromised score, left incomplete at Offenbach’s death. The new production of Bizet’s “Carmen” may also provoke some debate over questions of authenticity.

Bizet wrote “Carmen” as an opéra-comique, which meant that extended stretches of dialogue were spoken, not sung. The term opéra-comique gives the false impression that such operas are comic. But even serious works within this tradition used spoken dialogue as a way of conveying everyday realism.

“Carmen” had its premiere in Paris in March 1875, just months before Bizet died at 36. Later that year, for a production of “Carmen” in Vienna, the composer Ernest Guiraud adapted the spoken dialogue from the libretto (by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy) into recitative, which he wrote. It was in this version that “Carmen” gained its immense popularity for the next century.

Starting in the 1960s or so, it became increasingly common for “Carmen” to be performed as Bizet intended: with spoken dialogue. The Met chose that option for its celebrated 1972 production, starring Marilyn Horne and conducted by Leonard Bernstein, documented in a Deutsche Grammophon recording.

For its new production, by the director Richard Eyre, the Met is using Guiraud-composed recitatives, which was also the choice of Franco Zeffirelli, who created the previous production in 1996, a lamentable show. Purists will no doubt object to the Met’s recalcitrance on this matter.

Pragmatic reasons are typically cited when a company chooses to use Guiraud’s recitatives. Singers who are not native French speakers are often reluctant to speak the language on stage. Also, mezzo-sopranos who revere classic old recordings, like the historic 1951 RCA recording starring Risë Stevens, with Fritz Reiner conducting, often long to sing the role the way they heard it growing up.

The Met’s new “Carmen” is a gripping and brilliant production. Still, I would have been willing to hear certain singers speak imperfect French for the chance to experience the opera with the realistic urgency that comes from having the dialogue spoken. In this case, Elina Garanca, the Met’s Latvian Carmen, would have been trading many spoken lines with Roberto Alagna, the French tenor of Sicilian heritage, which would had added pressure on the star.

Today, at least a majority of opera companies around the world present “Carmen” without the Guiraud recitatives. Let the debate begin.
