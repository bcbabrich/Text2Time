So here’s the latest, after a day of piling on by Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, Vice President Dick Cheney, many other Republicans and some Democrats.

Late this afternoon, after canceling an interview on CNN’s “Situation Room,” John Kerry issued a new statement:

As a combat veteran, I want to make it clear to anyone in uniform and to their loved ones: my poorly stated joke at a rally was not about, and never intended to refer to any troop. I sincerely regret that my words were misinterpreted to wrongly imply anything negative about those in uniform, and I personally apologize to any service member, family member, or American who was offended.



It is clear the Republican Party would rather talk about anything but their failed security policy. I don’t want my verbal slip to be a diversion from the real issues. I will continue to fight for a change of course to provide real security for our country, and a winning strategy for our troops.

The question is, will that lay it to rest? For now, probably. Of course, this obviously will return to haunt Mr. Kerry if he tries to run again in 2008 for president.

The apology, after Mr. Kerry insisted Tuesday that he would not apologize, came late in the day, after Mr. Snow spent an inordinate amount of time at the daily briefing talking about how Mr. Kerry should apologize, no matter what he meant, said he meant, or said he intended to mean. We’re not going to do the back-and-forth from the Q. and A.; we’ll just send you to the transcript. (That’s not a slight of Mr. Snow, but the nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah between the press and the spokesman just dominated too much conversation, on the day when the October death toll of American soldiers in Iraq went up to 105.)

Of course, we do want to mention that between Mr. Snow and Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush, they have had a talking point for more than a day over the original “botched joke” by Mr. Kerry. Here’s the text of Mr. Cheney’s remarks, excerpted again as advance text as though it were a summit speech rather than a stump speech for Senator Conrad Burns of Montana:

Instead they highlight people like John Kerry, their presidential nominee in 2004. Aren’t we lucky he lost that election? You remember John Kerry, the senator who voted for the $87 billion before he voted against it, the guy that was always lecturing us about nuances. He’s the one, you’ll recall, who last year said that American soldiers were terrorizing children in Iraq. And just this week he took another swipe at the U.S. military. Here’s what he said, word for word. Quote: You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework, and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well. If you don’t, you get stuck in Iraq. End quote. Well, apparently Senator Kerry’s the one who needs to be educated. Of course, now Senator Kerry says he was just making a joke, and he botched it up. I guess we didn’t get the nuance. He was for the joke before he was against it. As a leading Democratic senator, John Kerry needs to learn that the men and women serving in Iraq aren’t there because they didn’t study hard or do their homework. The all-volunteer force represents the very best of this country. They’re smart, patriotic, exceptionally well trained, and dedicated to their mission. They are heroes, and they are the pride of the United States of America.

Or Mr. Bush on Rush Limbaugh’s show. Yep, it’s like a tiger gnawing on red meat.

Anybody who is – who’s in a position to serve this country ought to understand the consequences of words, and our troops deserve the full support – they – of – of – of people in government. They – people here may not agree with my decision. I understand that. But what I don’t understand is any diminution of their sacrifice. We’ve got incredible people in our military, and they deserve full praise and full support of this government.

We’ll end on this note. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, out campaigning for re-election, called Mr. Kerry’s initial remarks “inappropriate.”

More important, she said that elections are about the future, and “we don’t have to be re-fighting the 2004 election, as much as President Bush would like that.”

Or anyone else.

Enough said.
