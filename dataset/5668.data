The camera work of both the Summer and Winter Olympics was invariably beautiful or exciting or dramatic, and sometimes all three, from the kaleidoscopic multitude of oars flashing in the rowing races to Gabriela Andersen-Schiess's staggering into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on the last leg of the women's marathon.

From the broadcasting booths, ABC sought at first to make the Summer Olympics not just a great sports carnival but an American sports triumph (something it couldn't do in Sarajevo, because the United States squad was not dominant). The network figured that this would sell, but the blatant cheerleading and the unprofessionalism antagonized many, even a good number of naturally partisan Americans.

Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, sent a letter of formal complaint about ABC's coverage to the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee and its head, Peter Ueberroth. Next, Roone Arledge, directing the network's Olympic coverage, was apprised of it, and he reacted. The brassy boosterism was toned down, and with no discernible drop in viewing pleasure.

And what, it followed, is the appropriate role of the commentator on a televised sports event? Well, he should bring to the microphone a sense of showmanship, certainly, but also a sense of journalistic propriety, of maintaining perspective.

Above all, we ask that our intelligence not be insulted. We want to be given captions to what we're seeing. Much of the story is unfolding before our eyes, and so we need not be told too much. And the announcer, no matter who he is, is not the show. We tune in for the event and not the commentator, a point of which some commentators are not aware. The caption notion was true during the Olympics, a special event, and it is true on regular sports shows.

In the ratings two weeks ago, for example, the

final ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast of the

season was the second-ranked show of the week, behind only ''Dynasty.'' The game matched two attractive teams - the Dolphins and the Cowboys - and was of great interest to fans following the National Football League's playoff possibilities.

In the last few months, there has been some scratching of heads about the diminishing ratings of pro football on television - and of ''Monday Night Football'' in particular, especially since Howard Cosell, who had been in the booth since the program began in 1970, had taken his leave. A question was raised: Is ''Monday Night Football'' fading because Cosell is gone?

Answer, according to the recent ratings: No.

Provide a game of interest, and the fans will tune in.

The sports event as drama, whether it be a football game or an Olympic race, remains the story.
