To the Editor:

"Boon to Anglers Turns Into a Disaster for Lakes and Streams" (Science Times, Nov. 17), on the claim that fish-stocking programs may in some cases harm rare species, lacks perspective. Anglers have always been at the forefront of efforts to conserve native fishes and fish habitats. Fish stocking is a small part of restoring fish populations and fishing to what it once was.

Land around water is so heavily developed, and water is such a heavily used resource, that practically all aquatic ecosystems are heavily disturbed and suffer from loss of diversity. Game fish, being at the top of the food pyramid, suffer most from this loss of diversity. Fish-stocking programs are a feeble effort to restore native populations or to provide nonnative populations in areas that can no longer support native fishes.

Examples of these efforts include stocking striped bass in the Hudson River to mitigate losses because of power plants, and the introduction of brown trout into waters that have become too warm and silted for native brook trout. These efforts are hardly a boon to recreational anglers.

It is not clear that the few problems you indicate for native fish result from stocking. For example, you cite small mouth bass as an obstacle to reintroduction of Atlantic salmon by stocking, but Atlantic salmon once coexisted with bass in many watersheds. Lake trout in the Great Lakes are devastated by the sea lamprey, introduced through the St. Lawrence Seaway, but are little affected by introduction of Pacific salmon.
