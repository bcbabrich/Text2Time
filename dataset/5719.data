To the Editor:

Carlyle C. Douglas deserves credit for bringing attention to the gravity of Bedford-Stuyvesant's lead-poisoning problem (''In Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant, Glimmers of Resurgence Are Visible,'' news story, April 19). However, the article implies the commonly held misconception that the main cause of New York City's childhood lead-poisoning cases is toddlers picking and eating lead-coated paint chips from tenement walls.

Studies have shown that only about 20 percent of the city's cases are caused in this manner.

A majority of the city's childhood lead-poisoning cases are related directly to the deteriorating internal conditions of the apartment houses the children inhabit. Lead dust particles from crumbling walls and ceilings fall to the floor where young children walk, crawl and play. They then inadvertently ingest the particles from the air they breath or, more commonly, by placing fingers covered with lead-paint dust into their mouths.

Thus, it should not be implied that the lead-poisoning victim is in any way to blame for his or her disease (i.e., picking and eating lead paint chips). Instead, we should all begin to take account of the environmental hazards that children, living in neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant, face during their everyday lives.ANDREW B.
