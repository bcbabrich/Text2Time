WHILE he and his wife were strolling in Manhattan one hot summer evening a few years ago, Leonard Schwartz, the Pittsburgh psychiatrist who invented Heavyhands, spied a runner with the hand weights. But instead of pumping the weights up and down as he ran, the young man was merely carrying them.

''I ran after him for four blocks, yelling in the 90-degree heat,'' Schwartz recalled. ''I walked with him three or four blocks trying to explain about pumping them. And when he went off, he was doing it right.''

This story comes pouring out in his stream-of-consciousness way, and it neatly illustrates the intensity of the obsession that has come to drive Schwartz's life: combined exercise. The concept is simple. Use as many muscle groups as possible during a workout to achieve maximum oxygen consumption by the muscle cells. The trendy little weights cushioned with red foam rubber used to accomplish this are incidental. Schwartz doesn't disagree that you could be grasping two jars of mayonnaise. Or two bags of bird shot. Or two stones. It's the weight and the movement of the arms in concert with the rest of the body that is everything.

Schwartz is so certain of the purity of his vision that he believes he could alter forever the world of fitness if those who are blind and deaf to his idea would but open their eyes and listen.
