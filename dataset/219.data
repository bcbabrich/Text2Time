The World Health Organization last month added “internet gaming disorder” to its manual of psychiatric diagnoses, and the reaction was, shall we say, muted.

At a time when millions of grown adults exchange one-liners with Siri or Alexa, the diagnosis seems years overdue, doesn’t it?

Put down your phone and look around: If half the people you see walking down the street or riding the bus with you are face-deep in a small screen, then it’s not a wild leap to think that some percentage of us, particularly those younger and male, have fallen hard for “ Fortnite” or “League of Legends” or “World of Warcraft” and cannot get up, except to fetch the occasional bowl of Lucky Charms.

They’re stuck. They sleep with their heads on keyboards. They could use a friend of the breathing, let’s-go-to-the-park variety. They could use some help.
