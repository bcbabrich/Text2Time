In Bermuda, no less than in the United States, it seems that it is customary to pile on the perks when compensating chief executives.

Evan G. Greenberg, who runs the insurer Ace Ltd. and is the last C.E.O. left in what had been the first family of the insurance industry, did not have to dip far into his pocket to pay for much in the way of personal travel and leisure last year.

Ace, based in Bermuda, gave him a housing allowance of $214,000, along with what it called "customary" benefits, like a car, a club membership and the use of the company plane, its proxy statement shows.

Oh, Ace also paid Mr. Greenberg -- the son of Maurice R. Greenberg, who was ousted as chief of the American International Group amid an inquiry into possible financial manipulation, and the brother of Jeffrey W. Greenberg, who was forced out as C.E.O. of Marsh & McLennan amid allegations of bid rigging -- more than $7.5 million in cash and stock. Patrick McGeehan
