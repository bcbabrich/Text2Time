Dr. Theodore VanItallie, a consultant to the United Weight Control Corporation, a formula weight loss program based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., has concluded that rapid weight loss can be sustained only by long-term psychological support and nutritional education. He has been in the vanguard of obesity study for 27 years.

Losing It and Keeping It Off

In the past 10 years, the medical profession lent credence to the liquid diets by developing safe liquid formulas and more effective monitoring of their physiological consequences. But science has succeeded primarily in teaching people how to live without food. In order to maintain their weight loss while living with food, dieters need a new psychology toward eating.

Acknowledging the potent psychological area between feast and famine, the premier liquid formula diets, like Optifast and United Weight Control Corporation, are using behavior modification training. ''We have shifted from acute intervention to the long-term reality of keeping the weight off,'' said Jim Parsons, a vice president of Optifast Programs, ''but if there are 100 chapters in the maintenance program to be written, we're only on Chapter One.''

The Promise

From Hospitals To the Mass Market

In an effort to treat the morbidly obese, those with at least 100 pounds or even half their body weight to lose, Dr. Saul Genuth and Dr. Victor Vertes developed the 320-calorie milkshake-like formula derived from milk and egg protein that eventually became Optifast.

A spate of copycat formulas followed, some made from inferior protein with limited nutritional value. Bill Gregg, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, noted that in 1978, the Public Health Service attributed 17 deaths to an over-the-counter liquid protein powder and the F.D.A issued a warning about such products. It still recommends a doctor's supervision for any severely restricted weight-loss diet, he said.

But for patients with weight-related, life-threatening medical conditions the low-calorie formulas provided the quickest way to lose weight. Today's formula diets are derived from highly nutritional protein from milk, eggs or soy. They contain more protein, fiber and calories than earlier formulas and more trace elements than had been contained in earlier formulas.

Still, the formulas, which range from 400 to 800 calories a day, severely restrict caloric intake and cause rapid slimming that can lead to physiological changes like loss of body protein and fluids, losses that can affect the liver and heart.
