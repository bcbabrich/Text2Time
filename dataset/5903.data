IF you're a kid living in New York, and you haven't been cast in a movie, you're just not trying. Even pictures that aren't shooting in the city have dispatched operatives to wander through schools public and private searching for talent. Take the director Moshe Mizrahi (who made the Academy Award-winning ''Madame Rosa''), for instance. He begins filming ''The Children's War'' in Budapest this week, and he chose New York teen-agers, five boys and two girls, to be his leading players. The screenplay, by Abby Mann, based on ''The Survivor,'' an autobiographical book by Jack Eisner, is about children of the Warsaw ghetto who rose against the Nazis in 1943, and Mr. Mizrahi wanted the cast to come from one place, so moviegoers wouldn't be jarred by a variety of accents. ''They have to speak the same music,'' he says.

Mr. Mizrahi lives in Israel, though he began his directing career in France, and he's very impressed by New York's youngest. ''They are talented and bright,'' he says. ''They have no illusions, no bitterness. They're not trying to settle accounts with anybody.''

Mr. Mizrahi works well with children, and one of his most personal films, ''I Love You, Rosa,'' about a little boy and an older woman, was based on the life of his great-grandmother.

''She lived to be 107,'' he says. ''When she was 21, her husband died, and the Jewish law said she had to marry her brother-in-law. He was 11 years old. She had to wait until he reached the age of reason, so he could decide either to marry her, or to give her her freedom. That woman decided she would take that child, raise him, fashion him to be her husband, and she just did that. When he was 15, he married her, and they had 10 kids. I identified with that story, especially when I was sliding into adolescence. I thought it would be marvelous if a woman would take me and teach me.''
