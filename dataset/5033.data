The N.C.A.A. has moved with unaccustomed swiftness -- and cowardice -- through the final chapter of The University of Nevada-Las Vegas basketball scandal, the longest-running case of recruiting violations in the history of the athletic organization. The ending, like this whole tortured case, is a disgrace.

Earlier this week the National Collegiate Athletic Association lifted its ban and reinstated U.N.L.V. to the 1991 post-season tournament, despite outstanding penalties for recruiting violations dating back to 1977. The ban, imposed earlier this year, had been delayed for 13 years while the U.N.L.V. coach, Jerry (Tark the Shark) Tarkanian, fought the charges in the courts. His challenge to N.C.A.A. authority was finally turned back by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988.

Fearing another legal backlash, the N.C.A.A. has allowed the university to play now and suffer its penalty at a more convenient time. Under this arrangement, the basketball team will sit out 1992 post-season play and will not appear on television for the 1991-92 season.

The delay and the penalty negotiations came about because Mr. Tarkanian threatened to sue, as did players who stood to lose leverage in professional contract negotiations, if they were denied the exposure this year's tournament would bring. Some N.C.A.A. officials also feared that if U.N.L.V. were not allowed to choose its punishment it could barge its way into the tournament under an injunction and defend its national title that way.
