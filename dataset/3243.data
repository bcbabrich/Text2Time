Mentally ill people who have heart attacks are less likely to be offered the kind of treatment customarily available to other patients, a new study reports.

In some cases, Yale researchers wrote in The Journal of the American Medical Association, patients with conditions like schizophrenia are 32 percent less likely to undergo cardiovascular procedures.

The researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing the cases of 113,653 patients 65 or older who had had heart attacks -- 5,653 of whom were listed as mentally ill.

They found that those patients with mental disorders were 25 percent less likely to be given angioplasty to remove blockages, 32 percent less likely to have bypass surgery and 28 percent less likely to have cardiac catheterization.
