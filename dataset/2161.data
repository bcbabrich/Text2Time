WHILE the jet setters schuss down the groomed slopes of Aspen Mountain in their designer ski outfits and enjoy first-class food at the summit lodge, the hard-core ski and snowboard set skips lunch altogether and seeks whatever powder can be found on the steep, raw terrain at neighboring Aspen Highlands.

Instead of a pampered gondola ride, hardy skiers hike the 30 minutes to the 12,392-foot summit of the Highland Bowl. Aspen Highlands rounds out the variety of terrain from beginner to extreme offered by Aspen's four mountains. The others are Aspen Mountain, Snowmass and Buttermilk.

On Dec. 10, Aspen Highlands grew even bigger, with the opening of the long-awaited Deep Temerity Lift, giving access to an additional 1,000 vertical feet and 180 acres of new terrain. The lift, which is a fixed-grip triple chair, sews together the mountain's signature double-black diamond slopes by eliminating long traverses. It also doubles the length of most of the runs in the Temerity area, including the famed behemoth face of Highland Bowl.

The so-called trails weave through in trees, gullies and meadows that offer a more solitary, adventurous experience than the cookie-cutter trails on the front side of the mountain. It's also raw, with the occasional hidden obstacles the ski company is always warning people about -- stumps, rocks, and other natural features.

"It's early-season conditions, so there's bound to be some stuff sticking up," said John Hufker, project manager at David Johnston Architects, who has lived in Aspen for seven years. "But the terrain is superfun. There're gullies and plenty of stuff to launch off of, but it's mostly about the access, about not having to make the traverse out of the bowl." Standing at the bottom of the new lift on opening day was Mac Smith, 53, director of the Aspen Highlands Ski Patrol since 1979. As he watched his lifelong vision come to fruition, a smile spread beneath his long moustache. He listened to the whoops and hollers of skiers and boarders as the public experienced the new terrain for the first time, plowing tracks into the nail-biting steeps below the 1,700-foot lift that seems to hang almost vertically on a 53 percent cable grade.

Mr. Smith has been scouting out this "new" terrain since he was 19 years old, skiing out of bounds in the same area where the new lift is located today. A horse rancher's son who grew up in Emma, 20 miles west of Aspen, Mr. Smith was on the bulldozer last summer, clearing 45-degree slopes and herding his crew of snow packers and patrollers.

The Highlands Master Plan, which has been in the works in one form or another since the mid-70's, has finally been completed with the opening of the $2.7 million project. Whip Jones, the former owner of Aspen Highlands, ordered what was then known as the Deep Steeplechase lift in 1976, but a record lack of snow that same winter made its installation fiscally impossible.
