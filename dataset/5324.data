Sharp Kabushiki Kaisha, the Japanese parent company of the Sharp Electronics Corporation, has designed a language-translation machine that helps sort out the nuances of words with multiple meanings.

The machine analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence to interpret the most likely meanings of the words.

If a word has more than one definition, the computer displays the translated sentence along with each of the possibilities, and the operator chooses the translation that seems to make the most sense.

An American lawyer for Sharp said that a commercial product was still in development.

Sharp received patent 4,774,666.
