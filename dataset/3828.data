One of North America's largest glass-enclosed butterfly facilities -- housing some 2,000 butterflies from tropical countries -- is adding domestic species this summer in a new outdoor butterfly garden densely planted with perennials and flowering shrubs.

The landscaped garden and walkways, home to about 120 North American butterfly species, is scheduled to open this month at the Niagara Butterfly Conservatory in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Visitors follow 600 feet of pathways past flowing water and fish ponds to watch butterflies drawing nectar from yellow sage, Egyptian star-flower and passion flowers. They can also watch these insects of the Lepidoptera, or ''scale wings,'' order emerge from their chrysalids.

About six miles from Niagara Falls, the $10 million, 11,000-square-foot conservatory, which opened last December, is in an 80-acre botanical garden. The conservatory, nearly two-thirds clear glass, is kept at a year-round temperature of about 85 degrees. A 200-seat auditorium, a 250-seat cafeteria with indoor and outdoor seating, and a gift shop are among the facilities.

The Niagara Butterfly Conservatory is open daily from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. Admission is $4.50, $2.25 for children 6 to 12. The conservatory is wheelchair accessible. Information: (905) 356-8119. ALBERT WARSON
