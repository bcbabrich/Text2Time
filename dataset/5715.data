Thomson's final-round 71 gave him a 205 total for the 54-hole tournament and a check of $37,500.

January finished with a 69 for 206 and earned $24,000 for his second-place finish.

The 55-year-old Thomson, who started the day with a three-stroke lead, was up by four shots with only five holes to play, but lost his lead by the time the pair reached the 18th hole.

Both players hit their second shots to the 381-yard hole into the left greenside bunker, but January failed to get up and down.
