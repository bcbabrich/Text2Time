The American Express Bank formally protested yesterday the loss of its Government contract to provide banking services to American servicemen in three European countries.

On Aug. 21, the Defense Department awarded the $26.8 million contract, which American Express Bank had held for 40 years, to the Merchants National Corporation of Indianapolis. The management contract covers 134 bank branches in West Germany, Greece and the Netherlands.

American Express Bank said it had learned in a debriefing session on Friday that in its initial invitation to bid the Defense Department had omitted one of the criteria that it ultimately used. Specifically, American Express Bank said the department indicated that it was looking for suppliers who had a United States retail banking presence. American Express Bank, the international banking arm of American Express, is legally barred from domestic banking.

The complaint was lodged with the Government Accounting Office. The Defense Department cannot make its contract with Merchants final until the challenge is resolved, which could take up to 90 working days, a G.A.O. spokesman said. Spokesmen for Merchants and for the Defense Department declined to comment.
