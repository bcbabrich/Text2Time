Richard S. Fuld Jr. told a federal commission that his firm, Lehman Brothers, failed only because the Federal Reserve refused to step in as it did with other firms.

Mr. Fuld said that if temporary financing had been available or if Lehman had been allowed to convert to a bank holding company among other steps, bankruptcy could have been averted.

In testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Mr. Fuld said:

Lehman was forced into bankruptcy not because it neglected to act responsibly or seek

solutions to the crisis, but because of a decision, based on flawed information, not

to provide Lehman with the support given to each of its competitors and other nonfinancial

firms in the ensuing days.

Mr. Fuld argued that “there was no capital hole” at Lehman, saying that it had $28.4 billion in equity capital as of Aug. 31, 2008. He also contended that Lehman had adequate collateral, and that all it needed was a liquidity bridge to get it through those dark days of September 2008. He told the panel:

Lehman had the capital. We needed the liquidity. We had — we went into that last week with over $40 billion of liquidity. We lost close to 30 of it in three days. It was a classic run on the bank. We needed the liquidity.

In his testimony, Thomas C. Baxter Jr., the general counsel of the Federal Reserve of New York, disagreed with Mr. Fuld’s premise:

The Federal Reserve did not “allow” Lehman Brothers to die, bankruptcy being the equivalent of death to a financial company. Instead, the Federal Reserve, the United States Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and others tried hard to save it — not for its own sake, of course, but for the sake of all the families and businesses who would be harmed by the devastating effects of a Lehman bankruptcy. We did not succeed, but the effort made was serious and determined. We came very close.
