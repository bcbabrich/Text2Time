Jim Ryun is considering a return to active track and field competition, possibly as early as late this month.

The 23‐year‐old Kansan, who holds world records in the mile and half‐mile, said yesterday he hoped to announce his plans shortly. But all signs point to a resumption of his career, which ended abruptly 18 months ago in the Amateur Athletic Union outdoor cham pionships at Miami.

During the meet, Ryun dropped out of the mile‐run final less ?? halfway through the race, saying he was “dis gusted with myself.”

“I never learned how to lose,” Ryun said after that race. “I guess I'll just lay off and let the desire build up again.”
