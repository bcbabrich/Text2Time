Despite what he calls continuing abuses of human rights in China, the United States Ambassador here argues that Beijing has made "dramatic" progress in improving the lives of its citizens and that this record should be taken into account when policy toward China is reviewed early in the new year.

In an interview this week, Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy said that the setbacks in human rights represented by the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the wave of repression that followed were being steadily reversed, and that the Communist Party had loosened its control over many aspects of Chinese life.

His comments came before a Congressional review in January of China's record on human rights. Before July, President Clinton must decide whether China has made "overall, significant progress" in human rights and thus deserves to have its beneficial trade status renewed. Question of Progress on Rights

Mr. Roy, 58, a career diplomat who is to complete his tour in Beijing next summer, said he could not predict whether China would satisfy the standard of "overall, significant progress."
