MONDAY PUZZLE — It’s always nice to see a puzzle that celebrates my hometown, and Jeffrey Wechsler returns to do just that.

There are four theme entries today that have good old New York City hidden in them and three of the four entries — DESTINY CALLS (which I heard in my head as “destiny awaits, except that didn’t fit), FELONY CHARGE and COMPANY CAR — are making their debuts. Mr. Wechsler wraps that up by stretching the city’s nickname — THE BIG APPLE — across the center of the grid.

I hit a speed bump in the northeast, an oddity on a Monday, because I was not familiar with the actor JON SEDA. On the other hand, I really liked the long Down entries, WHAT’S MY LINE and WOULD WE EVER.

Did you get a rise out of the clue for 30 Across? The answer is YEAST.

Your thoughts?
