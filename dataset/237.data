Happy International Vulture Awareness Day! Honest to gosh. No snickering. Vultures do a lot of good things for the environment, and they’re tired of being dismissed just because they look creepy and eat carrion. No vulture, for instance, has ever been known to drive a golf cart onto the putting green. Or brag about grabbing a lady vulture by her private parts. Or separate children from their mothers at the border. Go vultures.

I’m sure it’s a coincidence that this is also the start of the big election campaign season. Time to get focused. Lots of critical races all over the place, but let’s begin with North Dakota. Next week the president goes to Fargo to help raise money for Kevin Cramer, the Republican congressman who’s trying to knock off Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp. President Trump was in the state for Cramer not too long ago, but he just can’t get enough of the place. It’s possible that by Election Day we will be able to calculate he spent more of the autumn with North Dakotans than with his wife.

Of all the states the Democrats are worried about this fall, North Dakota may be No. 1. And that is fine by North Dakota, which doesn’t usually get much attention. This may be, in part, because it has approximately as many people as visit Grand Central Station on an average day.

Yes. North Dakota’s population is about 755,000 residents. (State slogan: “Bigger than Wyoming!”)

Correction: North Dakota’s official motto is not really “Bigger than Wyoming.” We are fiends about accuracy and I don’t want you to get the wrong idea just because I made a joke. It’s “Liberty and Union Now and Forever, One and Inseparable.” Although I believe many of you will agree that mine is better.
