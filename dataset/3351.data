SOME people just can't get enough of school, no matter how old they are.

Take Stuart Friedman. He's a partner in a Manhattan law firm, the kind of busy guy who returns phone calls from taxis en route to business trips. So what was he doing committing one evening a week to Mark Fichtel's classes at the Larchmont Mamaroneck Center for Continuing Education?

So far as Mr. Friedman is concerned, Mr. Fichtel's teaching -- first in a class about Russia and then one about Spain -- was well worth any contortions in his schedule.

''I took the second course because the first one Mark taught was so good,'' said Mr. Friedman, who had scheduled his child's soccer practice, where he coaches, just before Mr. Fichtel's class. ''I always had had an interest in Russian history and literature, and the course was superb, at a college level, but a college course without a text or readings where it was on fast forward, sophisticated and detailed.''

Mr. Friedman is one of the students who are changing the face of adult and continuing education courses, once overwhelmingly tailored to the interests of active retirees who had plenty of leisure time for a class in art appreciation or cooking.
