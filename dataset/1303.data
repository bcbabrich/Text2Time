The chief executive of CBS, Leslie Moonves, may be leaving the door ajar for a settlement with Charlie Sheen, the troubled star of “Two and Half Men.”

“I hope it’s back; we will see,” Mr. Moonves said of the show when asked about it at an investor conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.

Until now, CBS has declined to comment on the status of the show.

Last week, production on “Two and a Half Men,” one of the highest-rated shows on TV, was scrapped for the rest of the season after Mr. Sheen publicly ridiculed its creator, Chuck Lorre. Production was previously halted because of Mr. Sheen’s medical problems.

Mr. Moonves said at the conference that in the short term, suspending production “is actually a gainer” for CBS.

“Doing eight less originals saves us quite a bit of money,” he said. “I am not saying long term I want this to go on or it’s great, but the repeat last night actually was the fourth-highest rated show of the night.”

He did not comment on Mr. Sheen directly, except to make light of the star’s many interviews. “He is on the air quite a bit these days. I wish he would have worked this hard to promote himself for an Emmy,” Mr. Moonves said.

Whether it is self-promotion or something else, Mr. Sheen kept himself in the limelight on Tuesday. He called in to Howard Stern’s radio show in the morning, and in the afternoon he posted his first message to Twitter.

“Winning,” it said, repeating what seems to be his favorite word. “Choose your vice,” it continued, with a link to a photo of Mr. Sheen and a female companion clutching a juice drink and a jug of chocolate milk.
