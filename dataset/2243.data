Iraq has withdrawn from a World Cup warm-up match with Tunisia, Reuters reported today.

The Carthage Eagles were due to play Iraq on June 7 at Tunisia’s World Cup base in Schweinfurt in Germany, according to the Reuters report. The Iraqis were replacing Kuwait, who had pulled out.

“The Iraqi team will not be able to fly to Germany for the match because of administrative problems,” a Tunisian federation spokesman said.
