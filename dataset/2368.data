Tourism experts had hoped that Rochester would capitalize on its Lake Ontario location, a 171-mile boat trip from Toronto. The city found developers in the late 1990's, when two Rochester natives, Dominick DeLucia and Brian F. Prince, took up the idea. The men, friends since graduate school, had made their fortunes at Lehman Brothers in New York City and returned to their hometown with the idea of helping it to better times. They spent several years putting together their plan and arranging financing from Dutch and Australian lenders for the purchase of the ferry last year for $42.5 million. The ferry has a movie theater, a gift shop and a restaurant and can make the voyage in under three hours.

Almost immediately, their company, Canadian American Transportation Systems, ran into trouble. Mr. DeLucia said they were undercapitalized and could not cope with several mishaps, including a docking accident at a Manhattan pier after the ferry was brought from an Australian shipyard to Rochester last spring. After repairs, the engine malfunctioned. Both incidents pushed back the start date by several weeks, while the company continued to incur payroll and other expenses.

Higher fuel prices and customs and pilot fees added to the company's debt, along with a loss of anticipated revenue from transporting tractor-trailers, which were not allowed on board because of increased border security.

The ferry, which can carry 774 passengers and 238 cars, often sold out. But the company was more than $2 million in debt by Labor Day. After only 80 days, the owners abruptly stopped service, leaving 200 without jobs and hundreds of others with worthless tickets.

"Reading the future isn't possible," said Magistrate Jonathan W. Feldman of the district court. Pointing out that there are "risks and rewards" in every business venture, he said that "no one has ever disagreed" about the vessel being given a fair opportunity to succeed in this community."
