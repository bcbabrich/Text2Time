ASIAN composers have in recent years devised ingenious ways to pull elements of their native traditional music into their scores. But Ichiro Nodaira, the featured composer in a festival presented next weekend by Music From Japan, couldn't care less.

In fact, Mr. Nodaira makes a convincing case that even in music composition, it's perfectly possible to study Western practices, and then go out and beat us at our own game. Having spent a dozen formative years in Paris (1978-90), where he composed at the computer-music studio Ircam and served as pianist for the Ensemble Intercontemporain, Mr. Nodaira, 50, has so thoroughly internalized Western music that he coolly resolves problems most composers either shrug off as too profound to deal with or don't even know they have.

His pacing, for example, an uncanny balancing of the inevitable with the unexpected, gives a listener an unusual and palpable sense of overall destination. This might be easy enough to pull off were he something of a pastiche composer, but he is not. No phrase deviates from the inflections of his opening measures. What gives you the impression of being carried farther and farther along into places that, while stylistically consistent, sound utterly new is a careful holding-back of possibilities -- textures, say, and instrumental juxtapositions -- until their moment of maximum impact.

It bespeaks an unusual degree of patience and feel for drama. For if you're just going to let your imagination rip -- and Mr. Nodaira does -- you have to consider the risk that all your inspired textures will eventually cancel themselves out, making your piece sound pretty much the same from beginning to end. True, some composers want this effect; Mr. Nodaira is evidently not among them. He prefers to strike a balance between inventiveness and restraint.
