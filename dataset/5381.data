The strong pass is already barred in many parts of the world, and the new Laws of Duplicate Bridge, due to come into force in this country on March 31, have been written to permit the restriction. This method has attracted some adherents and caused much controversy in the South Pacific. Australians argue about it and often lose matches to New Zealanders who employ it.

In the 1981 World Team Championship the confusion that such methods generate was demonstrated on the first deal shown in the diagram. At most tables North opened one heart and East-West bid themselves to a successful game in spades or no-trump. But there were unexpected developments when New Zealand played Pakistan.

The one-spade opening shown was not a psychic. It was a system bid, unrelated to spades, promising 0-9 high-card points. This immediately created a problem for North, who might have tried two hearts. His double simply showed opening values, by partnership agreement, and led to a disastrous contract when South tried one no-trump and East emerged from the bushes with a penalty double.

Pakistan had lost the bidding battle, but proceeded to win the play. A spade was led and ducked in dummy. East won with the king and cashed the club queen, showing his strength there, before continuing a spade.

The heart king was allowed to win, and another heart was led. The jack won and another spade removed the queen. The defense was now in a position to take the remaining tricks, for a penalty of 700, but the defense had an accident. When West won a club lead with the jack, he did not cash his spade winners. Perhaps he was nervous at the start of a world championship or perhaps he thought he would regain the lead with the heart ace. Or he may have pulled out the wrong card when he produced the diamond ten.
