What is the moral justification “for you to play what is essentially a game of Russian roulette” with someone’s life? It’s a brutal question posed by a journalist against the breathtaking backdrop of Mount Everest. It’s also one that nags at you throughout “Sherpa,” an exceptionally absorbing documentary.

Jennifer Peedom, the director, and her team went to Nepal in 2014 to document the climbing season and observe the Sherpa leader Phurba Tashi, who was to hike to the summit of Mount Everest for a record 22nd time. While they were on the mountain, a gigantic ice block crashed onto one of the routes, killing 16 Sherpas.

Several days later, foreign climbers (who pay upward of $100,000 each) wanted to continue their trek. Many Sherpas demanded that the season be canceled to honor the dead. That dispute lies at the heart of the film.

Sherpas (though that name is synonymous with mountain guides, it denotes their ethnic group) have long been viewed as smiling servants. Yet, in recent years, they’ve become more educated and aware of the meager rewards they receive for taking immense risks.
