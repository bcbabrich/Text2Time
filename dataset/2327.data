With Tooble—that’s GooTube—offering

Big Media vast sums of hush money ("how bout you buy yourself some new iPods and just SHUT UP about ‘copyright’"), it’s nice to see that the little guy, too, is tired of waiting to turn online-video FUN into online-video PROFIT.

Or is this a hoax?

In any case, this just in: A dude claims here that he set out to make rent money by advertising Nike. He acquired a vintage Nike t-shirt, dressed someone in it and stationed him next to the British reggae D.J. David "Ram Jam" Rodigan at a concert.

Then—or so the dude says—he filmed the concert, keeping his Nike man front and center, and uploaded it to YouTube. He explained his project to the folks at Nike and, when the vid has 15,000 hits, he made—again, he claims, furnishing some inconclusive documentation—$1,815.88.



So, wait: you can make an ad totally by yourself and get hits on YouTube and then get paid by, like, Nike?!?!?!

Of course people went to the video originally to see that D.J., so you need a decent hook to start with. But then those viewers couldn’t have missed the swoosh. And, even if the logo were photoshopped in later, doesn’t the vid still function as a Nike ad? (This question was posed by buglewood, the cool anonymous tipster who tuned me in to this whole thing.)

For further study: Could THIS be an ad for Vans?
