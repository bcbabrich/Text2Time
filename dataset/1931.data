This week my Advanced Placement students took their first tests. The questions were of the type they will confront on the May A.P. examinations. Most struggled. Students who are used to acing exams saw raw scores of less than 60 percent. As a classroom teacher, I can put this in perspective for them by showing them how they did without crushing their spirits. In other words, the raw percentage is not what I put into the computerized grade program. Let me explain why.

Imagine this. You are about to ride a two-wheel bicycle for the first time. Should you be riding with no helmet, no training wheels, and be marked as a failure if you fall? Should I hold students to the high standards I want them to eventually achieve the first time they try something new? I think not.

I acknowledge that I have a real responsibility to challenge my students to meet high standards. But I have an equal or greater responsibility not to discourage them. For better or worse, some students do agonize over every single grade, and I don’t want a poor performance to lead to their “shutting down” or even dropping out of the A.P. class, which they could do.



So I curve tests. Some might object. My students are grateful, and not merely because it protects their G.P.A.’s, over which some sweat bullets. By not being punitive, I can continue to challenge them to do much more as they are learning how to rise to the standards I expect — standards I know they will have to meet to be successful on the actual A.P. exam in May.

Some of you might object to my grading on a curve. So let me rephrase it: I take a raw score and convert it into a scaled score: many standardized tests do precisely the same thing. That happens on SAT’s, on A.P. exams, and most assuredly on state examinations. It is often possible to get an 800 on a section of a SAT I without answering every single question correctly: publications of released real SAT examinations provide conversion tables that demonstrate this. And in Maryland the passing scaled score varies by subject, from 394 (out of a possible 650) in Government to 412 in Algebra..

I will not deny that tests can provide useful feedback. But tests are an objective measurement and I prefer not to see my students objectively. Ultimately I am teaching people, each unique, not a subject, for which the only measure is an arbitrary standard. I am a teacher, not a tester.

I think of one student I have who came to this country as a pre-teen. His parents are very involved in helping him succeed, but he still struggles to express himself verbally, and his writing is limited by his less than perfect vocabulary. He can read accurately. And on multiple choice questions he can do quite well. If asked to write a paragraph, he may have more difficulty demonstrating his underlying understanding. What is the fairest way to assess him?

Or take another student of mine, a native of a French-speaking African nation. He stumbles if I ask him to read aloud, although he understands what he is reading, and can write reasonably fluent English. Should I punish him for his unwillingness to volunteer in class discussions, when I know that he is learning and on task?

Yet another student of mine has a strong tendency to be disruptive if she does not get attention, and yet runs the risk of embarrassing herself because she often does not grasp the material which she is trying to address. She will volunteer, and get frustrated if she is not called on. So I give her the opportunity by calling on her at least once or twice a period, knowing that she will get things wrong, while still ensuring that the class does not either get misled by her errors nor react negatively to her being wrong.

These are just a few examples of how one type of assessment doesn’t fit all in my classroom.

There is always a risk a student will blow an early test, and then give up, believing he can no longer succeed. Or a student may get in trouble, then believe I will afterward be hostile towards her. School should not be so rigid that even a series of mistaken judgments or poor performance locks a student into a pattern of failure. Perhaps were I being strictly objective I would not say that. But I view my job as teaching students, and while I will push them to measure up to what others consider objective standards, I have the responsibility to work with each student where she is.

Teaching is at the heart of the educational experience. Teaching, not testing. I increasingly believe that our educational system’s emphasis on testing in the name of improving our schools will have the effect of driving away good and dedicated teachers who refuse to apply practices harmful to the ultimate wellbeing of the students in their care. And the sad truth is that if we continue on our current path, many of our best and most dedicated teachers will leave, to the detriment of our schools and our students. And that would truly be a tragedy.

I know that I am far from alone in my attitude towards all this. I have seen gifted colleagues retire because they no longer could put up with the restrictions that interfered with meaningful teaching. There have been gifted beginning teachers whose idealism was damaged by the demands of our current skewed system of accountability. In our attempts to “improve” our schools we are in fact often destroying what is most valuable: the ability of the individual dedicated teacher to respond to the immediate situation of the student before her. Absent that, one is, in my opinion, perhaps an instructor, but certainly not the kind of teacher who can have a long-term, even lifetime, impact upon students. And isn’t that the kind of teacher we want for all of our children?
