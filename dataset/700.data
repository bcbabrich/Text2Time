The 1974 Canadian-produced “Black Christmas” offended pious sensibilities with a serial-murder-on-a-silent-night theme; in 1977, the Ontario-born director David Cronenberg took dry glee in the accidental machine gunning of a shopping mall Santa in his “Rabid.” Canada’s scary-movie war on Christmas is taken up once more in “A Christmas Horror Story,” a quasi omnibus of horror scenarios requiring no fewer than three directors (Grant Harvey, Steven Hoban and Brett Sullivan) to deck its halls. Unsparingly gory and on occasion actually shock-inducing, it can’t help falling prey to Genre Overreach syndrome, in which horror fans turned horror creators maniacally pile up their favorite terrorizing tropes, as if they’d never get the chance again.

William Shatner’s virtually phoned-in turn as a Christmas Eve D.J. ties the proceedings together, or as together as they can get, and his character provides the requisite nod to a John Carpenter film (in this case, “The Fog”). A story line involving a “changeling” never rises above the promising. Another that culminates in a nice teenage girl’s turning all sex-crazed is too tiresome to be redeemed by its ultimate gruesomeness.

And the most initially risible of the stories, involving an anti-Santa called Krampus and featuring deathless dialogue, like “Elves becoming the walking dead? No, it does not make sense,” winds up having the most effectively diabolical payoff of the bunch. Nevertheless — or perhaps the proper word here is “therefore” — the picture can be wholly recommended only to not-too-demanding horror junkies who’ve been successfully nurturing their inner adolescents since the late 1970s.
