John E. du Pont, the millionaire charged with killing a former Olympic wrestler, lost his bid today to be released to a psychiatric institute.

In a ruling denying Mr. du Pont's plea to be released on bail for that purpose, Judge Patricia H. Jenkins of the Court of Common Pleas cited the defendant's questionable mental state, two-day standoff with the police, request for a passport, wealth and proficiency with guns as reasons for the decision.

The judge also found that security at the mental hospital failed to measure up to that provided by the Delaware County Prison, the suburban Philadelphia jail where Mr. du Pont has been confined since Jan. 28, when he was arrested in the shooting death of David Schultz, 36, at Mr. du Pont's home in Newtown Square.

Judge Jenkins said in a seven-page opinion, "The commonwealth has met its burden of demonstrating that no combination of bail conditions, especially those which rely upon the institute's security provisions, can assure the defendant's appearance at trial."
