Mr. Kornegay and Mr. Middleton were also convicted of second-degree felony murder and second-degree burglary; Mr. King was acquitted of those charges.

About two hours earlier, the jurors told Justice John J. Leahy that they had reached a verdict on two of the defendants but could not reach a decision on the third, believed to be Mr. King. A key prosecution witness had testified that Mr. King attended a planning session in a crack house in which he suggested one of two plans for murdering Mrs. Greene. But Justice Leahy directed the jury to continue to deliberate.

The two murder charges each carry a minimum sentence of 15 years to life and a maximum sentence of 25 years to life. The burglary charge is punishable by a sentence of 5 to 15 years. By law, the sentences will run concurrently because they arise from the same crime. As the defendants rose separately to face the jurors, who stood with an American flag hanging on the wood-paneled wall behind them, the sounds of evening traffic drifted in through the open windows.

After the verdicts were read, Mr. Middleton, who faces a robbery charge in another incident, slumped into his seat and bent his head forward onto the back of his lawyer's chair. Mr. Kornegay, who is already serving 25 years to life on a previous murder conviction, sat down and rested his face on his hands. And Mr. King, a senior at a Manhattan trade school at the time of his arrest, stood with his head drooping at one point. Before his arrest in this case, he had no criminal record.

Key evidence in the case was a videotaped confession by Mr. Middleton that he fired a 9-millimeter pistol at Mrs. Greene's head as she lay on the floor of the car service office after she was shot with a sawed-off shotgun by Mr. Waddel Winston, 27. Mr. Winston is to be tried in the murder later.
