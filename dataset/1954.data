Aired Friday night on NBC: I had two kids come by for Halloween, one dressed as Mickey Mouse, the other dressed as an Acorn volunteer trying to register him to vote.

Hey, did you see Barack Obama on the news? He took time out to take his kids trick-or-treating, but he would only let them take candy from households making over $200,000 a year.

Well, gosh, only four more days and then Sarah Palin has to give all those clothes back. It’s amazing, isn’t it?

This weekend, daylight savings time. You know what that means? An extra hour for this stupid campaign.

As you know, a lot of voters in Florida have already cast their ballots using early voting. And here’s the weird part. George Bush

has been declared the winner again.

In less than a week, President Bushwill be a lame duck, as opposed to just being a lame president.

Well, in a speech yesterday, Joe the plumber said that John McCain is a real American. And who better to say who is a real American than a fake plumber?

Joe the plumber has now signed for real with a publicist and a manager, and he already has a book deal in the works. In fact, we have an advanced copy right here. It’s called “Eat, Pray, Flush.”

Oh, what else? Well, God bless John McCain. You know, I’ve got to give McCain credit for ignoring the polls and fighting on. The guy’s a fighter. I mean, he’s been declared dead by the pollsters and twice by his own doctor.

And this week, John McCain said people who live in coastal states like Florida should get more of the money from offshore drilling. I think that’s called spreading the wealth around, isn’t it?

And today, Barack Obama’s campaign accused John McCain of looking in the rearview mirror, which would make McCain the only guy over 70 who actually does that.
