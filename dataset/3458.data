The State Department report said Mr. bin Laden, who has recently operated from bases in Afghanistan and is being sought in the United States on murder charges, had ''global reach'' and offered ''logistical help to extremists not directly affiliated with his organization.''

Department officials insisted that the decision not to designate Iran as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism was not meant as a gesture of good will toward Iran.

Instead, they said, it reflected a reduction in terrorist attacks that could clearly be attributed to organizations supported by Iran. The report found that Iran apparently killed fewer Iranian dissidents abroad last year than in 1997.

''There is a slight improvement in their record, and we wanted to reflect that in our conclusions,'' said a department official who insisted on anonymity. ''We just didn't feel the need to single them out in the way we have in the past. We obviously want to encourage better behavior.''

Others in the Administration said the report had been worded in a fashion that they hoped would make clear to Iran the willingness of Washington to improve ties.

''It would obviously be tough for us to go out there and brand Iran as the world's premier terrorist state while at the same time talking about our hope for better relations,'' said an American official who insisted on anonymity. ''If the Iranians read this as a signal for better ties, fine.''

The report found that Iran ''continued to be involved in the planning and execution of terrorist acts'' and that it might have been responsible for the murders of five leading Iranian writers and political figures last year. The department also said Iran continued support a variety of terrorist groups in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hizballah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
