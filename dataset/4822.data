AS soon the news of Time Warner Inc.'s rights offering was made public in early June, investors reacted vehemently, sending the stock down $21.25 a share, to $95.75, within a week.

The company's directors did not know what hit them. Several people close to the situation said the board had little idea the response would be so negative. The board, which includes executives who have headed corporations like I.B.M., Xerox, Macy and Borg-Warner, also did not foresee that the opposition would last so long or that there would be such serious objections from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Nor was there any indication that the corporation's prestigous law firms -- Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison -- or the lead bankers in the deal -- Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch -- knew what was coming. "I don't think any of us expected the reaction to be as loud and vociferous as it was," said a director, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the board was surprised hat the rights offering was interpreted as a coercive one.

The deal that was finally approved unanimously, after a four-hour meeting on the afternoon of June 5, gave the holder of each share a sixth of a right to buy a new Time Warner share for $63 to $105, depending on the response to the offering. The aim was to issue 34.5 million new shares and raise $3.6 billion to pay down debt.
