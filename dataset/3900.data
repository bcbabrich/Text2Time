For Nassau County Executive: Lewis Yevoli, a Democrat, is waging an uphill battle in his campaign against the incumbent Republican, Thomas Gulotta, who will probably be able to outspend his opponent 20 to 1. Mr. Yevoli, the Oyster Bay Town Supervisor, is a longtime fixture in Nassau politics who has been a persistent critic of the Republican political establishment.

Over the last few years, Nassau's economy has improved while crime has dropped. Those changes mirror national trends, but Mr. Gulotta also deserves some credit for his management. During his 10 years in office he seems to have become a better, more disciplined executive.

Nevertheless, Nassau County has been run by a single party for too long, and is in need of a shake-up. The signs of its deep-seated problems include a doubling of the county debt over the last decade, a tripling of the debt service, archaic assessment practices, overly generous labor contracts and projected budget revenues that are just one step short of imaginary. Mr. Gulotta can run the status quo efficiently, but he does not have the political flexibility to impose substantial reform. For that reason, we endorse Mr. Yevoli.

For Seventh District State Senator: In this important race to fill the term of the late Senator Michael Tully, our endorsement goes to the Democrat Doreen Banks, a North Hempstead town board member who served a brief but productive stint as Nassau County Clerk. Her opponent, Assemblyman Michael Balboni, is both energetic and knowledgeable. But Mr. Balboni, a lawyer with roots in the county Republican Party, would bring nothing new to the State Senate, which is already chock-full of attorneys and career politicians.
