Louisville (19-10, 10-6 Big East) at Marquette (19-9, 10-6)

The Golden Eagles have won three in a row. All on the road. All in overtime.

“It’s been a draining week physically, mentally, emotionally,” Coach Buzz Williams told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel after the third one, 84-83 over Seton Hall on Sunday. “Three games on the road in the last eight days, all have been overtime, 135 minutes of one-possession.

“We kind of tied a knot at the end of the rope and were hoping to hang on. We’re thankful that we were able to.”

The Golden Eagles showed their balance, if not their depth, against Seton Hall. Each of the starters played at least 40 minutes, and each of the starters scored in double figures. Even if it lost its last two regular-season games, Marquette would be 10-8 in — arguably — the toughest conference in the country. That could secure an at-large position in the N.C.A.A. tournament.

Louisville is nearing an at-large bid as well. A loss to West Virginia in late January left the Cardinals 13-8 overall and 4-4 in the conference. Coach Rick Pitino kept telling his players that if they got to 11 conference victories, they’d get to the tournament. They have 10 after going 6-2 in February. In their victory at Connecticut last Sunday, the Cardinals were outrebounded (50-22) and outscored (22-5) on second-chance points but compensated by making 15 steals and forcing 22 turnovers.

If the Cardinals don’t win No. 11 on Tuesday, they get a last chance on Saturday, at home against top-ranked Syracuse.

That is the final game at Freedom Hall, Louisville’s home court for 54 seasons.



Georgia Tech (19-9, 7-7 Atlantic Coast Conference) at Clemson (20-8, 8-6)

Expect both teams to be right in the middle of the N.C.A.A. tournament, seeded in the 7-9 range, but don’t be surprised if they lose in the first round. The Yellow Jackets are nearly unbeatable at home (14-1) but they are lost on the road (1-6 in the A.C.C.). The frontcourt combination of 6-10 Derrick Favors and 6-9 Gani Lawal can be intimidating; Favors has nine double-doubles this season, Lawal 11. But both players can disappear; Favors had 4 points and 2 rebounds in a loss at Wake Forest, Lawal had 9 points and 6 rebounds in a loss at Duke. Iman Shumpert, a 6-5 guard, could be the key for the Yellow Jackets. He has played two solid games — against Maryland and Boston College — since being a nonfactor in three straight. How he handles Clemson’s pressure could determine if the Yellow Jackets win and establish themselves as a No. 8 seed.

The Tigers helped their at-large drive by rallying from 13 points down to win at Florida State last Sunday.

Trevor Booker, an undersized power player at 6-7, is Clemson’s leader. Demontez Stitt runs the offense. Andre Young, a 5-9 guard, is adding plenty of scoring coming off the bench. He has 56 points and 14 assists in the past five games.

No. 24 Texas El Paso (22-5, 13-1 Conference USA) at Marshall (22-7, 10-4)



The Miners have won 12 in a row and last Saturday’s victory over Rice clinched a share of the regular-season conference title, but Coach Tony Barbee was far from pleased. “This means nothing to me,” Barbee told The El Paso Times. “Not a thing. We didn’t come into this season for a share. People ask me why we aren’t cutting down nets, celebrating. I don’t celebrate ties.”

Perhaps a season-high 21 turnovers had something to do with Barbee’s bad mood. “We can’t afford to take steps backward, and tonight we took a step back,” he said.

The Miners can clinch the regular-season title outright — and solidify their positioning in the N.C.A.A. tournament — by beating Marshall. They could be hurt by their nonconference schedule, though. Their best victories are against New Mexico State and Oklahoma. They lost to Brigham Young and to Mississippi. The interesting matchup will be between Derrick Caracter of U.T.E.P. and Hassan Whiteside. Whiteside, a 6-11 freshman, leads the country in blocked shots (5.5), is tied for fourth in the conference in rebounding (8.7) and averages 13.4 points a game. Caracter, a 6-9 junior, is right behind, averaging 8.5 rebounds, 14.1 points and shooting 55.7 percent. Whiteside’s strength is rebounding and defense. Caracter is much more polished offensively, and can score inside or outside.

Caracter, remember, had a tumultuous time at Louisville before leaving.

No. 13 Vanderbilt (22-6, 11-3 Southeastern Conference) at Florida (20-9, 9-5)

A.J. Ogilvy outplayed Vernon Macklin and the Commodores beat the Gators handily in January. Macklin has scored 8 points or fewer in eight conference games. Even though they are a guard-oriented team, the Gators will need more from Macklin in the rematch. Otherwise, the Commodores can concentrate on stopping Chandler Parsons, Erving Walker and Kenny Boynton. The Gators won three in a row and it appeared they established themselves as a solid at-large team when they upset Tennessee last Tuesday. Then they lost at Georgia. Still, 20 victories and wins over Michigan State, Tennessee and Florida State can’t be overlooked. Neither can a loss to South Alabama. And if Parsons had missed that 75-foot heave at the buzzer against North Carolina State, and that 3-pointer at the buzzer against South Carolina, the Gators would be 18-11.
