Karim Khalef, a former Mayor of the West Bank town of Ramallah who was maimed in a bombing in 1980, died Saturday of a heart attack, the Israeli radio reported. He was 50 years old.

Mr. Khalef was elected Mayor of Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in 1972. He was considered one of the leaders of the National Guidance Council, a Palestinian group in the West Bank.

In June 1980, a bomb placed in his car exploded, and he lost part of his left foot. The Israeli police blamed members of a Jewish underground group for the attack.

Mr. Khalef was one of three Palestinian Mayors removed by Israeli military authorities in March 1982 because of their refusal to recognize the Israeli civil administration in the West Bank.
