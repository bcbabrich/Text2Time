At least six people were killed Saturday when an World War II-era airplane crashed into a lake after its pilot gave an impromptu aerobatics display before hundreds of spectators at a pilots' convention.

Divers on Saturday night removed six bodies from the wreckage of the plane, which broke apart after hitting Clear Lake. The divers continued searching today for a seventh person believed to have been on board.

Just before the crash, the bulky twin-engined Lockheed P2V Harpoon, which was designed as a Navy patrol plane, made four low passes over the crowd and the floating seaplanes at the lake for the annual ''Seaplane Fly-In.'' Clear Lake is about 100 miles north of San Francisco.

''When it would go by, he would put a cloud of smoke and then go away and straight up through the sky,'' said Debbie Fields, owner of a boat rental company on the lake. ''This guy we were sitting with said, 'He can't do that in that kind of plane.' ''
