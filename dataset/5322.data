Twenty-seven pilots, including at least two who fly large airliners, were indicted by a Federal grand jury in Florida yesterday on charges of denying past drug- or alcohol-related convictions in applying for pilot medical certificates.

The indictments, charging the applicants with making false statements, were the first in what the Justice Department called a nationwide project ''to vigorously pursue this abuse in a critical sector of the nation's transportation system.''

Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said inquiries into similar cases were under way in all 50 states. ''Hundreds of further such indictments are expected,'' he said. Airline Pilots Included

On the list of those indicted yesterday were a pilot for Delta Air Lines, Fred Kopec, and a pilot for Orion Air, John David Klepac. Delta said that Mr. Kopec, of Orlando, a 27-year-old second officer flying Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, would be promptly suspended pending trial unless he could show that some mistake had been made in bringing a case against him. The status of Mr. Klepac, 48 years old, of Tampa, could not be determined immediately. Efforts to reach Mr. Kopec and Mr. Klepac by telephone were unsuccessful.
