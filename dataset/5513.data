To the Editor:

''President Reagan's Drug Bust'' (editorial, Nov. 13) makes, I feel, several pivotal errors in its position on marijuana.

Specifically, you assert that marijuana's potential health hazards are ''on a par with those of tobacco and alcohol.'' Is this an attempt to legitimize the use of marijuana by playing down the adverse effects of tobacco and alcohol? If so, it must be pointed out that smoking remains the single most preventable cause of disease in the United States. Moreover, the most widely abused drug with the gravest public health implications (e.g., vehicular accidents, homicides, suicides) continues to be alcohol. These two substances contribute to the premature death of more than a half-million Americans every year.

As for marijuana, scientific studies clearly establish a number of negative health consequences associated with its use. For example, marijuana smoke contains even more carcinogens and lung irritants than does tobacco. In the short term, marijuana can disrupt thinking, learning and remembering. High doses can cause hallucinations and create anxiety.

Marijuana use leads to as much as a 50 percent short-term increase in heart rate, can decrease the blood supply to the heart and cause chest pains. It affects glands and hormones involved in reproduction and may impair sexual development, fertility and functioning.
