Mr. Kim then gave the following account of Mr. Min's mission, based partly ou what Mr. Min had told him and partly on his own observation:

About June 15, President Park called Mr. Min to the Blue House, the Presidential mansion, and talked with him for hours about how to prevent Mr. Kim from testifying. Mr. Kim, who came to America in 1973, was perhaps the second most powerful man in Korea when he headed the K.C.I.A.

In the meeting, President Park instructed Mr. Min to take to the United States a Korean delicacy he knew Mr. Kim liked.

Mr. Min telephoned Mr. Kim from New York on June 18, requesting a meeting. Mr. Kim declined to see him.

The next day, however, Mr. Min, accompanied by a former subordinate of Mr. Kim's at the K.C.I.A.. went to Mr. Kim's home and they talked for eight hours. Mr. Min also visited Mr. Kim's home the next day, June 20, for a long conversation.

In the 16 hours of discussion, Mr. Kim said, Mr. Min offered him the following alternatives:

Mr. Kim was invited to return to Korea, where he and his family would be guaranteed safety even though he had helped American investigators confidentially and had given an interview to The New York Times.

Mr. Kim and his family could leave the United States for a third country, where the Korean Government would pay a large sum for his living expenses.

?Mr. Kim was urged to delay his testimony for two weeks to allow time for discussions with Korean Government officials over what he would say.
