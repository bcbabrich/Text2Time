Move the potted bulbs to a cool, shaded part of the room for a week or two until roots form. As the flower buds begin to emerge, gradually expose the plants to ever brighter light. A bit of direct sun is useful, but fortunately it is not imperative. Passion Flower Survival

Q. Last year I was given a small passionflower plant. I protected it last winter, and this summer it grew to about four feet up a trellis. How should we protect it this winter? It's in a sheltered spot. -- H. Hartnett, Sparta, N.J. A. The plant world is ever full of surprises, not the least of which occurs when warm-weather species like passionflowers succeed in surviving the cold. These are tropical and sub-tropical vines native to Brazil, so in theory they should not survive a New Jersey winter at all. Consider yourself lucky that yours did.

Since you have nothing to lose by further experiments (if you don't want to dig up the plant and take it indoors), you may as well mulch the roots. You might also try protecting the stems a bit by untangling them from the trellis, laying them on the ground and covering them with mulch. Pray for another mild winter and maybe you will be lucky again. Preserving by Drying

Q. Is it possible to preserve fern fronds, small branches or similar live materials without ending up with the ghastly artificial colors that I've seen? -- Elspeth Alexander, Seattle. A. The revolting colors are a result of certain plants' reactions to being dried in a glycerine solution or an antifreeze liquid. You can avoid these unnatural hues if you use sand, borax or silica gel as your drying material. Most herbalists consider silica gel the best, although it is also the most expensive.

Despite its name, silica gel is really a sandlike crystal that varies in texture from very rough to fine. It is sold at some hardware stores, pharmacies and craft shops. (The packets that you may find in pill bottles to absorb moisture are silica gel.)
