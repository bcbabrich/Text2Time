''Dance of Hope'' opens today at the Public Theater, just 13 days before the Dec. 14 presidential and congressional elections in Chile, the first since the military coup that overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens. The timing is not accidental.

The film, directed by Deborah Shaffer, is a documentary about the Chilean opposition movement that eventually led to the 1988 plebiscite in which the vote went against continued military rule. In particular, the movie documents the activities of a women's group calling itself the Association of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared.

Like their counterparts in Argentina who fought the former military Government in that country, the Chilean women are well organized and persistent, supported in large part by their sorrow and anger. Eight women of different backgrounds tell their stories. Intercut with the interviews are harrowing shots of anti-Government demonstrations, their suppression by the military and the women's efforts to finds the bodies of lost relatives in the desert wastes of northern Chile.

The title of the film refers to the cueca, the Chilean love dance usually performed by a man and a woman. To call attention to their loss, the women in the film perform the dance without partners. The movie attends an Amnesty International concert, held across the border in Argentina, where Sting performs to publicize the Chilean women's cause.
