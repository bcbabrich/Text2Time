Although it is illegal to sell, transport or set off fireworks here without a permit, the law is being flouted and a thriving black market is being operated.

As Independence Day approaches, the loud reports of firecrackers, cherry bombs, torpedoes and other fireworks can be heard with increasing frequency in many parts of the city.

Many adults and children seek to buy fireworks in Manhattan's Chinatown. They associate the area with fireworks because of such noisy celebrations there, as the Chinese New Year. They quickly learn that the shops have no fireworks for sale, either over or under the counter, but find accommodating bootleggers ready to fill the void.

For example, a 13‐year‐old Queens boy named Robert and his father went to Chinatown this week in an attempt to buy firecrackers. After visiting a dozen stores on Mott, Pell and Doyer Streets, they learned that none were for sale.
