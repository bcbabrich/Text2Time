“Addicted to Fresno” is one of those comedies that seem not to care whether you laugh. Parts of it seem openly hostile to the idea.

Shannon (Judy Greer) and Martha (Natasha Lyonne) are mismatched sisters whose relationship is defined largely by Shannon’s bad behavior. She is a sex addict whose licentious ways have gotten her into trouble, not to mention rehab, and as the story opens, she and Martha are working as hotel maids, with Martha trying to keep Shannon on, or at least near, the straight and narrow.

Soon, however, they have a body to dispose of, one of Shannon’s sexual relapses having ended badly. The rest of the movie documents their efforts to deal with this problem, which, among other things, leads them to try their hand at robbery.

The film, directed by Jamie Babbit, features a few high-profile stars in small roles, among them Aubrey Plaza, Fred Armisen, Molly Shannon and Jessica St. Clair.
