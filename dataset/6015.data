James O. Eastland's decision not to seek re‐election to the Senate perhaps tells a lot about the revolution wrought in Southerh politics by the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the last of the great legislative victories of the late Rev. Dr. .Martin Luther King Jr. The law did away with virtually all‐white electorates of the kind that first sent Mr. East land to’ the Senate in 1942 and maintained his generation of Southern segregationists in office. Since 1965, over two million new black voters have registered in the South, most of them in the seven states where the Voting Rights Act outlawed literacy tests and put the registration process under Federal control. Almost 2,200 black politicians hold office today in the old Confederacy, 11 states that before 1965 had fewer than 100 black officeholders. [A1:1‐3.]

Mayor Koch's goal in negotiating with the city's labor unions, people close to him say, is to get the unions to settle for less than thetransit workers got. The strategy was decided on when the Mayor agreed to the transit accord, the sources said. Even as Mr. Koch was announcing the transit settlement on Saturday morning, calling it “responsible and reasonable,” he knew that the city did not have the $800 million that would be needed to duplicate its wage terms for all municipal workers.

The prosecuting attorney at the multiple‐murder trial of Dr. Mario E. Jascalevich in Hackensack, N. J., has been taunted, instulted and mocked by the defense attorney who, in her view, has implicitly been encouraged by the judge, William R. Arnold. The prosecutor, Sybil R. Moses, moved that Judge Arnold disqualify himself, and to this, the defense attorney, Raymond R. Brown has responded that the motion indicates the prosecution's case is‐falling apart. Today Judge Arnold will hear arguments on whether he should step down. [A1:4‐6.]

The torrent of oil coming through the trans ‐ Alaskan pipeline has brought even more problems than the pipeline's critics foresaw. Consequently, Federal energy officials are considering swift remedial action. The principal problem is the vast oversupply of oil on the West Coast. Early estimates of projected use of the pipeline's oil in Western states have proved to be far too high, California's own oil production has suffered significantly, and the need there to move unexpectedly large quantities of oil has pushed tanker rates 50 percent above predictions.
