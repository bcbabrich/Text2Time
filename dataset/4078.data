The challenge of understanding the opposition to a friendly Government is made much more difficult because of the limitations of American intelligence-gathering techniques in Saudi Arabia, a closed society, where the United States has allowed itself to depend largely on the King and the top princes for information.

The information vacuum is reflected in the exhaustive report produced in September for the Pentagon after the bombing of the housing complex. The report concluded that the ability of the intelligence community ''to conduct in-depth, long-term analysis of trends, intentions and capabilities of terrorists is deficient.''

The report continued: ''Human intelligence is probably the only source of information that can provide tactical details of a terrorist attack. The U.S. intelligence community must have the requisite authorities and invest more time, people and funds.''

Ties That Resemble Links With the Shah

That is just what Congress did five years ago when it gave the intelligence community $150 million to understand foreign cultures better, especially in the Middle East, to train experts and create better ''human intelligence.'' However, it is not working. Intelligence agencies prefers spending money on more hardware, like satellites.

''It's frustrating that we still haven't done enough with all this lead time,'' said David L. Boren, the former Democratic Senator from Oklahoma, who as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee sponsored the legislation. ''There's a built-in group of contractors pushing to upgrade technological capabilities, but there's no one arguing to upgrade human resources.''

Although the C.I.A. task force concluded that Saudi Arabia was not another Iran, facets of the relationship between the United States and the kingdom mirror Washington's relationship with the Iranian Government of the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.

Like the Shah, King Fahd and his senior princes are extraordinarily sensitive to efforts by a friend, the United States, to penetrate their society and have tried to discourage American officials from making contact with opposition figures.
