The Better World Society, a Washington-based group founded last year by Ted Turner to use television to explore the issues of environment, population and nuclear arms control. is working with the British Broadcasting Corporation to produce a 12-part television series, ''Only One Earth.''

The series will be aired initially next spring on the Cable News Network, and negotiations for presenting it on the Public Broadcasting Service are in progress.

All production costs for the $400,000 project have been subscribed, and further funds are being raised for an accompanying color paperback and package of educational materials. The television series will be timed to reinforce the 1987 final report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which was chartered by the United Nations.
