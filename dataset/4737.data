It may well make sense to interpret the flight of Iraq's most modern fighter planes to Iran in this context. While American and other Western military analysts speculated about what initially seemed a large-scale Iraqi defection, several Saudi military officers quietly argued that the pilots had flown to Iran to prevent the allies from destroying the planes on the ground, as Israel did nearly 24 years ago.

Apart from the relief expressed here that another Arab leader had not been humiliated at the hands of the West, there is a deep conviction in Riyadh, Cairo and Damascus that Iraq must not be destroyed or dismembered in an effort to free Kuwait.

Baghdad is seen as a bulwark against the reassertion of Iranian influence in the region, something feared by Saudi Arabia and other countries with Sunni Muslim majorities. Animosity between Iranian Shiite Muslims and the Sunni Muslim world intensified duirng the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. Most gulf nations with sizable Shiite populations experienced an increase in terrorist attacks and attempts during the war. A Postwar Role for Baghdad

The conviction that Iraq should be preserved as a regional military power under new management was reflected in a statement issued Wednesday by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who met in the Red Sea port of Jidda for several hours. The two reiterated their call to Mr. Hussein to withdraw and spare his country further devastation. They said an immediate cease-fire was possible if the Iraqi leader, even at this late date, signaled his intention to withdraw from Kuwait.

Representatives of both countries have emphasized that the goal of the war was only to free Kuwait from Iraqi control. In a recent interview broadcast on the BBC, Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Butros Ghali, underscored the point by asserting that Egypt could coexist with any Iraqi Government that removed its forces from Kuwait, even one headed by Mr. Hussein.
