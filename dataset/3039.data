''The faculty is nervous,'' said Dr. Larry Frohman, a neurological ophthalmologist at University Hospital in Newark, part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. ''Many of us think is that this is about money, not excellence. My feeling is that the commission was handed its conclusions before the report was written.''

The plan, unveiled in October by a commission appointed by Governor McGreevey, recommended that the three research universities be recast as a single university of 64,000 students with semiautonomous campuses in Newark, New Brunswick and Camden. It also recommended consolidating leadership of the proposed new university by creating the position of chancellor. The commission that produced the 114-page report was headed by Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, a retired chief executive of Merck & Company who is a former faculty member of several medical schools.

The plan has been embraced by the New Jersey Institute of Technology and tepidly endorsed by Rutgers. But current and former officials at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey have been highly critical of the proposed merger, which is not surprising since the commission report lamented the school's reputation and said acidly that ''the goal of excellence has not been achieved.''

The volley was recently returned by Stanley S. Bergen, former president of the university, who said: ''The report's methodology is inconsistent and poorly documented. It scrutinizes U.M.D.N.J. under a microscope, examines Rutgers with the naked eye, and glances at N.J.I.T. through a telescope.''

Any reorganization would require the approval of the State Legislature and take years to put in place. First the governor plans to appoint a task force that will develop a blueprint for creating the new university. As Mr. McGreevey has frequently said, his overarching goal is the improvement of the state's medical schools, with the goal of attracting tens of millions of dollars in federal and private grants for medical and biotechnical research.
