To the world, she was Marilyn Monroe, the quintessentially glamorous movie star. To BERNIECE BAKER MIRACLE, she was Norma Jean Mortensen, a long-lost half sister.

Along with her daughter, Mona Rae Miracle, Mrs. Miracle has written "My Sister Marilyn," a book being published by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill today, which would have been the actress's 68th birthday.

Mrs. Miracle, 74, who was raised by her father and stepmother, did not know that her mother, Gladys Baker, was alive, nor did she know that she had a half sister until 1938. And she did not meet Miss Monroe until 1944.

"By then she was married to her first husband, Jim Dougherty, and came to Detroit by train to visit us," Mrs. Miracle said yesterday. "From then on, we stayed in touch. She used to call me when she was married to Arthur Miller and having trouble. I helped Joe DiMaggio arrange her funeral. I chose her casket and decided on the pale green dress she wore. She was a wonderful sister." NADINE BROZAN
