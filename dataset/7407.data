Two men and a woman who allegedly printed and cashed thousands of phony checks were said yesterday to have fleeced businesses here of $250,000 in the last four months.

The three were arrested on Jan. 18, but their arrests were not announced because of a continuing investigation by the Bronx District Attorney's office. Several more arrests are expected soon.

District Attorney Isidore Dollinger said yesterday that the members of the check ring “made remarkably accurate copies of checks.” They used a print shop at 447 East 161st Street, directly opposite the Bronx Criminal Court Building, he said. The shop was owned by Robert Goodson, 30 years old, one of the men arrested.

Used Genuine I.D. Pictures

The District Attorney said that company checks were usually those copied, particularly those of Consolidated Edison and life insurance companies. The members of the ring then printed fake identification cards and fake motor vehicle license and registration forms.
