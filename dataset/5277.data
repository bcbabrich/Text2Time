In Robbins v. California, he said: ''It is often forgotten that nothing in the Fourth Amendment itself requires that searches be conducted pursuant to warrants.'' The Chief Justice seems to have sanitized the language of the Fourth Amendment by asking us to forget that the ''right of persons to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.''

In Mapp v. Ohio, decided in 1961, the defendant was convicted of possession of obscene literature. Her conviction was based primarily on the introduction in evidence of supposedly lewd and lascivious books seized during an unlawful search of her home. At the trial, no search warrant was produced by the prosecution. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of conviction, holding that the rule excluding evidence unlawfully seized was ''an essential part of both the Fourth and 14th Amendments.'' This is the exclusionary rule criticized by Justice Rehnquist.

Now, we are told, ''what a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection'' (quoting Smith v. Maryland, 1979), even the intimate details and habits of the life he or she leads in the home.

It is no wonder that Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in dissent ''that members of our society will be shocked to learn that the Court, the ultimate guarantor of liberty, deems unreasonable our expectation that the aspects of our private lives that are concealed safely in a trash bag will not become public.'' He also stated, ''Scrutiny of another's trash is contrary to commonly accepted notions of civilized behavior.''

Finally, Justice White, writing for the majority failed to note that an Orange County ordinance required the respondents to ''remove from their premises at least once a week all solid waste created, produced or accumulated in or about his dwelling house.'' Accordingly, respondent Greenwood cannot be said to have voluntarily placed his trash in an area accessible to the public. He had no choice and was merely acting in compliance with a county ordinance. He was held to have surrendered his subjective expectation of privacy, but not in a manner society accepts as objectively reasonable. Society would not accept the proposition that a person merely by placing a letter or book in a mailbox for pickup by the postal carrier has surrendered reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of either. In 1789, James Madison wrote in ''Annals of Congress'' (Volume One, page 439) that ''independent tribunals of justice will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights'' (Amendments One through 10, ratified in 1791). Now, almost 200 years later, the Supreme Court of the United States has indeed encroached upon rights expressly granted in the Fourth Amendment by trashing our privacy. WILLIAM M.
