As The New York Times’s Zachery Kouwe wrote on Friday, Chrysler‘s bankruptcy is anything but ordinary. With the government serving as a major lender to the automaker and a prime mover in its negotiations with other creditors, this case is politically charged from the beginning.

A rift with Wall Street has already emerged, as a group of financial firms holding Chrysler’s secured debt has balked at the government’s debt restructuring proposal, calling it unfair and counter to the principles of bankruptcy law.

As the case was just getting under way, David Friedman, the head of the bankruptcy group at the law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, sent DealBook some of his thoughts on the political aspects of this Chapter 11 case.

The Obama administration has talked about a quick and “surgical” bankruptcy, bur Mr. Friedman (who isn’t involved in the case) suggests that novel issues could complicate Chrysler’s reorganization — especially as relates to the Chrysler holdouts, whose role as secured lenders would ordinarily put them first on the list to be paid back.

Those firms pointed out Thursday that they have been represented in their talks with the Treasury Departmentby major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have taken money under the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program. For the holdouts, that raised questions about how free the banks were to push back at the Treasury Department’s terms.

Some of these holdout creditors acquired their Chrysler debt on the secondary market for much less than full value, however. Critics of the holdouts say this raises questions about whether these creditors are simply speculators looking for a quick profit.

As the many players in Chrysler’s Chapter 11 went to court in New York on Friday for the first-day hearing, we thought Mr. Friedman’s comments made for interesting reading.

Mr. Friedman wrote:

We have issues here that have never really been implicated before. The holdouts are going to say that this is a noneconomic deal. They’ll take the position that if Chrysler were to liquidate, they’d get a premium to what they’ve been offered. That, in itself, is a legitimate defense of the holdouts against the plan. The valuation fight over what creditors will get in liquidation is not unusual and happens all of the time. What’s unusual is the notion of banks being socialized. If you’re a minority creditor, you’d be saying that you’re being outvoted not on the merits but because a good number of the banks are under effective — though not absolute — control of the government. There are going to be some minority creditors who will take the position that the banks’ votes should not be counted as traditional creditors are considered in most bankruptcies. Nobody has ever touched this issue before. If the holdouts are being outvoted by people who are voting to achieve a social policy that is being forced upon them by the government, they might argue that they shouldn’t be bound by that outcome.

He went on to suggest that the Chrysler case could have long-term effects on creditors’ rights and the value of contracts:
