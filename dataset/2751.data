Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld rode through the streets of the conquered Iraqi capital today, six weeks after the United States began the war to topple Saddam Hussein, and he saw for the first time the results of the military campaign he had waged from the Pentagon.

Mr. Rumsfeld dismissed any notion that he was indulging in a victory tour, but he clearly savored the chance to convene his top ground commanders and banter with cheering troops, 1,000 of whom gathered in a cavernous hangar. He also met with American and Iraqi officials who are struggling to restore water, power and other essential services to the city's 4.5 million people.

Addressing that population in a taped message to be broadcast on radio and television, Mr. Rumsfeld said: ''Let me be clear. Iraq belongs to you. The coalition has no intention of owning or running Iraq.''

In Washington, the White House announced that President Bush would take a tour of his own on Thursday night when he is scheduled to declare the war effectively over in a nationally televised address delivered from the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln some 100 miles off the California coast.
