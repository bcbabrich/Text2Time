Introduced on Thursday: 2011 Hyundai Equus

Is it real? After being teased in New York last year in concept form, this full-size, rear-drive luxury sedan will move from Korea to America in 2011, giving Hyundai a budget alternative to a Mercedes S-Class, Lexus LS, Jaguar XJ or other top-notch sedans.

What they said: John Krafcick, Hyundai’s chief executive in North America, said Hyundai would be satisfied with selling 3,000 Equus models a year. People with lifelong aspirations to own a Mercedes or BMW may not be interested, but other affluent people will be, he added. “The people we call the ‘strivers’ need and want that luxury badge, but for the millionaire-next-door buyer, a lot of them got that way by making smart purchases.”

What they didn’t say: Whether people who can spend 90 grand on a show-off sedan really care to announce that they spent less.

What makes it tick: A 4.6-liter V-8 delivers a peak 385 horsepower, just sneaking past the Mercedes S-Class and Lexus LS, though smallish displacement and a mere 333 pound-feet of torque may pose a challenge against the monsters of this particular midway. But Hyundai did float intriguing plans to lure and pamper customers: Hyundai dealers will pick up Equus models from owners’ homes, drop off a loaner, and return the Equus after service; buyers receive a virtual owner’s manual on an Apple iPad that they can also use to schedule service appointments and operate other applications. “Nobody wants to go to the dealership, not even a Lexus or BMW dealer,” Mr. Krafcik said.

How much, how soon? Hyunda says the Equus should start at between $50,000-$60,000 and be extremely well-equipped, meaning the Equus would undercut competitors by roughly $12,000 to $35,000.

How does it look? As with other Hyundais, the Equus checks off everything and more that a buyer would expect at its price. But the over-tall body and Korean home-market styling makes even a Lexus LS look like a Bentley in comparison. Worst case, the Equus becomes the Volkswagen Phaeton redux: An overreaching and already dated-looking sedan that may finally draw the line on how high the Hyundai name can travel in the market. Best case, Hyundai scores yet another coup by undercutting its rivals’ bloated prices.
