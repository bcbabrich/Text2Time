While living in Greenwich Village and Harlem, Wright produced hundreds of articles and short stories. Working for the Federal Writers Project, he wrote the Harlem section for New York Panorama and contributed to "The Harlems" in the New York City Guide. His friends in the arts included Ralph Ellison (future author of "Invisible Man" and best man at Wright's wedding), Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Nelson Algren, John Hammond, Carson McCullers and John Steinbeck. The turning point in his career came in 1940 when Harper and Brothers published "Native Son," with its memorable violent character, Bigger Thomas. It was a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and sold 215,000 copies in three weeks.

Because of Wright's lectures and writings against racism, the F.B.I. investigated him in 1942 to determine if he could be prosecuted for sedition. Professor Rampersad notes that Wright continued to be monitored by the F.B.I., and later by the C.I.A. as well, for the rest of his life. His autobiography, "Black Boy," was denounced as obscene on the floor of the Senate in 1945 by Senator Theodore Bilbo, a Mississippi Democrat. The book sold 195,000 copies in its Harper edition and 351,000 through the Book-of-the-Month Club. Living in France after World War II, Wright came under the influence of the existentialists. His novel "The Outsider" appeared in 1953, but existentialism was not his forte.

The reader of Professor Rampersad's notes on the text learns that the Book-of-the-Month Club requested changes in both of Wright's major works to cool down some of the sexual passages and to eliminate his political experiences. Wright wrote in his journal that pressure from American Communists led the book club to ask him to drop the second section of his autobiography, which dealt with his involvement with the party in Chicago. The challenging title "American Hunger" was changed to "Black Boy."

Wright acceded to the changes and made them himself -- understandably, since the book club meant recognition and improved his fortunes. For black as well as white writers -- in newspapers, magazines, books and films -- freedom of language and subjects were nowhere near the same in the 1940's as they are in the 1990's. But even with the cuts, "Native Son" was still strong medicine for white readers. It became politically correct (in today's phrase) to read it or see it performed onstage.

Now all the self-censored material has been restored in both volumes of "Richard Wright." For the first time, the complete text of Wright's autobiography has been brought together, using the page proofs that were set before the book club's intervention. Similarly, Wright's first novel, "Lawd Today!," is reinstated with its kaleidoscopic experiments restored. Present-day readers will be pleasantly surprised by its stylistic passages that recall parts of John Dos Passos' "U.S.A."
