Cristian Movila for The New York Times

Even the metal band that declared “Kill ‘Em All” can forgive and forget: When Metallica takes the stage Saturday at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland, the group will be joined in performance by its former bassist Jason Newsted, who left the band in 2001, Billboard reported. Mr. Newsted, who was hired by Metallica in 1986 to replace Cliff Burton, who died in a tour bus accident, said he had received the invitation to reunite with his old band mates from the drummer Lars Ulrich. “He said, ‘We want you to rock with us,'” Mr. Newsted told Billboard. Mr. Newsted quit Metallica to perform with acts like Echobrain, Voivod and the Ozzy Osbourne Band. He was replaced by Robert Trujillo, who is also expected to perform at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame show.
