''WE knew he was dead,'' a mother recalls.

''They said his heart would stop as soon as they turned off the respirator, but I knew they considered him dead from the way they were talking. That waiting, it was hell . . .''

Twenty years ago, such an auto-accident victim would have been pronounced dead in the emergency room. But medical technology has changed, and this young man was placed on a respirator that kept his heart and lungs going artificially even though his brain was dead.

By accepted medical standards, he was dead; he had suffered irreversible brain death. New Jersey, however, lacks a statute making brain death a legal point at which life ceases to be, and doctors could not pronounce him dead without a court order.

Twenty-six states have now adopted some form of the Uniform Determination of Death Act Howard Rosen, a lawyer in Newark, is a member of the New Jersey Commission on Uniform State Law. (U.D.D.A.), which gives brain death equal legal footing with the traditional common-law cardiorespiratory standard. New Jersey is not among them, but soon could be if a bill introduced in the Legislature is passed.
