The CompUSA Florida Citrus Bowl against Tennessee Saturday will be Joe Paterno's 24th bowl as Penn State's head coach. Several were memorable, but the one that has made the 66-year-old Paterno into something of a taskmaster this time was last year's bowl game. At the Blockbuster Bowl in Miami, Penn State lost to Stanford, 24-3, and disgraced itself, according to the coach.

"Never again," said Paterno.

So this year the coach swept up his players and took them to Melbourne, Fla., for a week, where he put them through an August-style regimen, even two a day practices, for three days.

Prepare in Melbourne, play in Orlando. The Citrus, with Disney World nearby, is renowned for its ambitious social events for the athletes, what coaches call distractions. Paterno even whined on Wednesday about the players having to stand around too long in the sun at one event. Laying Blame

Distractions were partly to blame, he said, the last time Penn State played in the Citrus Bowl, on Jan. 1, 1988. Clemson won, 35-10.
