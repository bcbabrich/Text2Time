THOSE intent on judging books by their covers may be challenged by some of the works included in the genre of book art. What to make, for instance, of Deborah Chodoff's ''Procrastination,'' an accordion-folded book bound with wire-wrapped egg timers, whose cover is an old alarm clock? Or of Ed Hutchins's ''Words for the World,'' whose pages are colored pencils bearing messages in different languages and whose cover is the metal tin in which they lie?

These and other structures and formats are embraced as book art, the ways in which artists use books as a medium to express their art.

Mr. Hutchins, 55, who took classes at the Center for Book Arts in Manhattan in the 1980's, defined a book as ''a structure for storing and sharing narrative.'' His books comprise more than 120 editions, including ''Do Sit Down,'' a concertina-folded paper text whose binding is the seat of a three-inch painted chair, and ''The Rabbit Report,'' an illustrated story on a hand-screened scroll that unfurls from a slit in the side of a papier-mâché rabbit.

His Mount Vernon studio, several blocks from the home he shares with his spouse, Steven Warren, a teacher, is a wellspring of book art-related material, including an archive of historical and contemporary art books. ''Book art has a history,'' Mr. Hutchins said, indicating two books from the 1940's, one in the shape of a three-dimensional bed, and a scroll of photography housed in a miniature bottle.
