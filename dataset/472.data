LOS ANGELES — To be (almost) clear: Members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences can still eat the free hors d’oeuvres at filmmaker receptions — as long as they don’t enjoy them too much.

On Thursday, the Academy created a minor panic among Oscar voters and those who court them when it announced new campaign rules for the coming Academy Awards season. One sternly worded rule said:

“Academy members may not be invited to or attend any nonscreening event, party or dinner that is reasonably perceived to unduly influence members or undermine the integrity of the vote. Members who fail to comply with this regulation will be subject to a one-year suspension of membership for first-time violations and expulsion for subsequent violations, as well as all other available remedies.”

What constitutes undue influence in a glamour culture, where the Dom Pérignon flows like sparkling water, became an instant head-scratcher.

Those promoting the Oscar prospects of ESPN’s documentary, “OJ: Made in America,” for instance, were about to send invitations to a filmmaker lunch at the not unfancy Craft restaurant next week in Century City. But they were suddenly left to wonder: Might a decent Viognier lead to suspensions or expulsions for all involved?
