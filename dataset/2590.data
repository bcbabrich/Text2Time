Sports authorities are moving aggressively, as they should, to block any athletes who have been using illegal performance-enhancing drugs from the American Olympic team. The doping of athletes so that they can train harder, recover from injuries faster and perform better has become such an international scandal that fans no longer know which records are legitimate and which are the fruit of chemistry. But as the United States Anti-Doping Agency casts its investigative net wider and relies on less conclusive forms of evidence than in the past, its own performance will be on trial. There is some danger that its zealous crackdown could ensnare some innocent athletes and bar them from a once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic gold and the endorsement opportunities that can bring.

Our own sense is that authorities are on the right track in broadening the kinds of evidence they are willing to consider beyond the traditional urine tests for prohibited drugs. The sad fact is that the cheaters who use banned substances have gotten good at outwitting the testers by using masking agents or designing new drugs that are undetectable by current testing protocols. The latest example is a newly designed drug, THG, whose very existence was unknown until an unidentified track coach supplied a sample and an Olympics laboratory devised a test for it. The American national shot-put champion and two hammer throwers have since been banned for testing positive for THG, and a British relay team was stripped of a world championship silver medal after one of its runners tested positive for THG.

Now the agency is turning to somewhat softer forms of evidence, mostly generated through a federal grand jury investigation of a California laboratory whose top officials have been indicted for supplying steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to dozens of athletes, including some of the nation's top track and field competitors. The evidence includes such items as training schedules with coded notations that may indicate banned drugs, checks from athletes to the laboratory and e-mail messages or files mentioning athletes or their coaches. The documents may need corroboration by insiders who know what the notations mean, and they may fall short of proving that an athlete actually ingested a banned substance that was prescribed.

Still, the anti-doping agency has already scored a notable success. Faced with the incriminating evidence, Kelli White, a champion sprinter, fessed up, agreed to cooperate with investigators and was suspended for two years. But Marion Jones, another star sprinter and an Olympic gold medalist, whose name surfaced in the investigation, has proclaimed her innocence and insisted that only a positive drug test should be considered proof of cheating.
