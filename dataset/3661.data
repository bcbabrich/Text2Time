If the prospect of trying to fix Social Security gives heartburn to nearly all politicians, it could be downright ulcerating for Vice President Al Gore. His role in any solution to the retirement system's looming financial problems could prove either a tremendous accomplishment or a heavy burden going into the 2000 Presidential race.

For President Clinton, insuring Social Security's viability for the 21st century is an overriding goal, but one for the history books. With no elections in his future, he can afford to cut benefits, raise taxes or tinker with the basic structure of what is arguably the most successful of Government programs.

It is tougher for Mr. Gore, who will be the host of a town-hall-style debate on Social Security in Cranston, R.I., on Wednesday. He has to keep his eye on crucial constituencies like organized labor, the elderly and other groups that want to keep Social Security more or less intact, while at the same time recognizing that many Americans are eager for a chance to invest some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market.

Already other Presidential hopefuls are staking out positions. Most striking are the emerging differences among Democrats.
