The act, typical of his show, wilted inside the hall. But it was a hit out in the world because it tapped the growing perception that a too-cozy relationship between journalists and government officials produced credulous reporting that helped start a war under false pretenses. It was the perfect pairing of a comedian and the moment.

Mr. Wilmore, whose “Nightly Show” occupies Mr. Colbert’s old 11:30 time slot on Comedy Central, knew he was part of a similar pairing, “one of those accidents of timing,” he said. Yes, he was a leading black comedian performing at the last correspondents’ dinner for the nation’s first black president. But his appearance was also coming during a national conversation about race and law enforcement; race and the news media — including at The New York Times — and race and economic injustice. Mr. Wilmore has branded this year’s political campaign “The Un-blackening” of the White House.

And now here he was, getting ready to address an overwhelmingly white crowd of reporters — a sign of how far journalism has to go in achieving meaningful diversity — in the middle of a party weekend that can give official Washington the same sense of remove that the decadent capital city has in the “Hunger Games” movies. I asked him if there would be any “White House Correspondents’ Dinner So White” jokes.

No, he said. He hinted at an inner tension between going for a big political statement and going for laughs. “That’s why I say Stephen did the bravest thing I’ve ever seen, you know?” he told me. “Because you want to go and have a good time, get laughs and have everybody say, ‘Yeah, you killed.’”

Before the dinner, Mr. Wilmore’s hotel suite was a show business version of a groom’s room before a wedding. Pacing around the living area were his manager; his agent; his publicist; one of his writers, Robin Thede; friends like Kenya Barris, who created the TV sitcom “Black-ish”; and his parents, Betty and Larry Wilmore. The whole group was to meet the president and first lady before heading into the hall.
