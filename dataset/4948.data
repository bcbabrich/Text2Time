Every youngster from Little League to Pop Warner football to the sandlots has heard it over and over. You have to work hard, learn how to win, learn how to overcome adversity. After that, if you're lucky, you may achieve success.

For Steve Lewis, it was the other way around. First came success. Now he is learning how to handle the good and especially the bad.

Lewis is a 21-year-old U.C.L.A. junior from Fremont, Calif. In 1988, as a freshman still unsure how to prepare for a race or how to run it, he unexpectedly won the Olympic gold medal in the 400-meter dash and another in the 1,600-meter relay.

Then came the learning process, which became more difficult because of two hamstring injuries in two years. Lewis says he is learning and progressing and becoming wiser.
