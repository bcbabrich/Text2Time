Re “Louis C.K. Ridicules Survivors of Parkland” (news article, Jan. 1):

In the Trump era of American politics, Louis C.K.’s use of survivors of Parkland’s tragic shootings as a gag line is not unpredictable. Applause at Trump rallies often comes after personal attacks and disparaging remarks directed at a group or individual, including the disabled, political rivals, the “fake news” media, disgruntled past supporters, foreign leaders who dare to oppose the president, immigrants, Muslims and so on.

It is truly shameful that the political atmosphere in America today makes someone like Louis C.K. think that his remarks are perfectly acceptable. Tragedies like Parkland can never be funny, and anyone who thinks so should never be given a microphone again.
