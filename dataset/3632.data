Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern and other Parks Department officials declined to comment. An official who spoke only on the condition that neither he nor his agency be identified said, ''Calling it a park site conveys a sense of permanence.''

The housing agency began its campaign to redevelop the garden sites in late 1996 by evicting gardeners from 50 of them and beginning development plans. Construction has started on a few sites, and design has been done on others.

At about the same time, the department announced that all gardens under its jurisdiction would be open for development or sale. Now, its inventory of garden sites has more than doubled, though they still represent just a small fraction of the 11,000 city-owned vacant lots.

Frank Braconi, executive director of Citizens Housing and Policy Council, a research group sponsored by the real estate industry, said the danger is that temporary uses, even if clearly defined in advance, can be very hard to end. ''If I were the city and knew that temporary uses all become entrenched in stone, I would never allow temporary uses,'' he said.

He suggested that the new policy, however reasonable, could mean an uglier city. ''We could end up with a lot of empty lots with cyclone fences around them,'' he said.

That is exactly the vision being suggested by a coalition of nine environmental groups called New York City Green, which said it was studying possible legal actions. Some advocates have urged that all the gardens be preserved, though others have said they would be satisfied with clear criteria for deciding which gardens should be preserved and which should be housing sites.

''This is nothing but a land grab,'' said Steven Frillmann, executive director of the Green Guerrillas, an environmental group that built its first community garden in 1973 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. ''But we don't suffer from tunnel vision,'' he said. ''We're not saying we have to hold on to every garden.''
