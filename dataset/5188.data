The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission approved an 11.5 percent rise in yellow-cab fares yesterday, the first in a series of expected fare increases on public transportation systems in the New York metropolitan area.

The taxi fare increase, the second in less than three years, goes into effect at 12:01 A.M. on Jan. 7, six days after the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected to impose its own fare increase of at least 15 percent for buses, subways and commuter rail lines.

The city's $1 billion-a-year yellow-cab industry, which carries 500,000 people a day, is the third largest mode of transportation in the region, after the New York City buses and subways, which carry more than 5 million people a day.

The M.T.A. board is to vote on a proposal to raise the transit fares on Dec. 15. Third Highest in the Nation
