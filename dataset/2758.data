Susan Marenoff, general manager of the Power since the team's founding, resigned yesterday in the wake of the team's 1-3 start this season. The Power made the playoffs in 2001, the Women's United Soccer Association's inaugural season, but finished in last place at 3-17-1 last year. The team has won only 2 of its last 18 games.

The Power has had three head coaches in the past year. Pat Farmer was fired midway through last season and replaced by the assistant Charlie Duccilli. Tom Sermanni was hired for this season.

Attendance has dropped over the past two years. The Power drew an average of 8,078 fans in the first season, but it averaged a league-low of 6,612 in 2002.

Kevin Crow, the league's chief operating officer, will handle the organization's day-to-day operations. Crow said the league might not hire a new general manager until after the season. Brandon Lilly
