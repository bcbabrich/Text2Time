BERLIN, Dec. 31â€”West Berliners gathered with relatives in East Berlin tonight to celebrate the New Year together for the first time since the wall cut their city in two in 1961.

Sixty thousand West Berliners had crossed the border by nightfall on temporary passes.

In a concession to the visitors, the Communist authorities announced that those who held passes for both today and tomorrow would be allowed to spend the night with their relatives. The others were told that they could remain in East BerIin until 5 A.M. The passes normally expire at midnight.

Many of the visitors waved their hats at West and East German guards alike, and shouted New Year's wishes.

Pressure in East Reported

Crowds of East Berliners awaiting their relatives thronged the streets on the other side. The East Berliners appear even more gratified than the Westerners over the holiday pass arrangement.
