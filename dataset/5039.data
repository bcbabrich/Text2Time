The premonition that a new kind of Hindu politics will sooner or later threaten the religious harmony of the pious but nonviolent South is just below the surface in many conversations. Trivandrum, the Kerala state capital, is not only a city where churches and mosques seem more numerous and prosperous than temples; it is also the seat of a state government dominated by secular Communists.

Communism is in flux, and so, in a different sense, is Hinduism. But if the left is searching for new policies, the religious right -- led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which brought down the Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh by withdrawing its support for him in the dispute over the Ayodhya temple -- has already found its direction.

"Until now, the B.J.P. has not been as strong here as it has been in the north," said B. Rameshkumar, a political analyst for Mathrubhumi, a Malayalam-language newspaper. "Mostly upper-caste Hindus used to join. But now, young people of all castes seem to be attracted. In fact, we don't really know what areas the B.J.P. may be cutting into. In Kerala, people would not want to reveal religious prejudices, because they always want to appear cultured."

Bharatiya Janata leaders are coming south with a powerful pitch: Hinduism, they say, is the truly Indian way of life. The polity they call Hindutva would cut across caste and region, and unite all Indians -- 85 percent of whom are Hindus -- in one spiritual fold. Yet India, which is a constitutionally secular nation, has a population of 840 million that includes about 12 percent Muslim and 2 percent Sikh, as well as other small religious minorities.

In Hindutva, those minorities -- half the population in Kerala state -- would be free to coexist, once they accept the majority view of the nation, Hindu militants say. The lower castes would be discouraged from thinking of themselves as separate entities -- a clear attempt by the Bharatiya Janata Party and more zealous groups to undercut efforts by other politicians to organize the disadvantaged to improve their lot.
