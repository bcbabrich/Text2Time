Priscilla Chan, The New York Times Learning Network

Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Comment on three Surrealist paintings.

2. Learn about a new exhibit on the development of Surrealism in the United States by reading and discussing the article “Filling In the Many Gaps in American Surrealism.”

3. Research, in pairs, the work of a particular Surrealist artist.

4. Write and share the text of an audio guide written about the artist’s work.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “Filling In the Many Gaps in American Surrealism,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050401friday.html (one per student)

-pictures printed from the Internet, as described in Activity 1 below

-resources about Surrealism (computers with Internet access, art books, library resources, encyclopedias, etc.)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Before class, print (preferably in color) the following three artworks from the Internet, and post them in the classroom in such a way as to allow all students to see the images (if possible, print several copies of the paintings and allow students to view them at their desks):

-Roberto Matta’s “Sick Flesh” (1932-3)

//www.matta-art.com/sick.jpg

-Arshile Gorky’s “Garden in Sochi” (1943)

//www.insecula.com/us/oeuvre/photo_ME0000089079.html

-Jackson Pollack’s “Lavender Mist No. 1″ (1950)

//cgfa.sunsite.dk/p/p-pollock3.htm

Upon entering class, students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “Look at the three pieces of art on display. For each one, answer the following questions: Do you think this image is a ‘work of art’? What message, if any, do you think the image is trying to convey? What is its meaning?” After a few minutes, allow students to share their responses. Ask students if they have ever seen this style of art before and what other information they might know about these art pieces. Explain to students that museums often use audio guides to help acquaint viewers with unfamiliar pieces of artwork. Ask students to think about the type of information young people would like to know and to hear on an audio guide about these and other, similar artworks.

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Filling In the Many Gaps in American Surrealism” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050401friday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. According to the article, who are the three men “often” associated with the influence of Surrealism on American art?

b. What is the new exhibit at the National Academy Museum?

c. What does the author mean by the statement, “If you leave this show disliking Surrealism American style, at least you’ll know why”?

d. What does the exhibit reflect about the art of any period, according to the article?

e. Who curated the exhibit, and where does she work currently?

f. When does the National Academy Museum claim was the last time such a comprehensive survey of American Surrealism was on exhibit?

g. What was one reason why the exhibit is not wholly comprehensive? What are some of the works that will join the exhibit later in Phoenix?

h. How many works are in the exhibit, and what years do they span?

i. Who are some of the artists whose work is on display?

j. What other types of artwork, besides two-dimensional paintings, are there in the exhibit?

k. Why is one gallery “festooned with string”?

l. How has Ms. Dervaux organized the exhibit?

m. How does the show begin?

n. When did Surrealism start “entering the museum establishment”?

o. What political figure is in Peter Blume’s “Eternal City” (1934-47)?

p. What were some of the social themes reflected by some of these artists?

q. How did Boris Margo help the Surrealist movement?

r. Why does the exhibit devote a special section for the California Post-Surrealists?

s. What are some differences between the beginning and ending sections of the gallery?

t. Who does Ms. Dervaux call “Dalí’s most successful American follower”? Which other artists might have deserved this distinction?

3. Explain to students that they will be further exploring the Surrealism movement, in the spirit of the new exhibit, to create audio guides. Divide the class into pairs and allow each pair to select a different artist mentioned in the article. Alternatively, print out the following list of some of the artists mentioned in the article, cut names into strips and fold over, and allow pairs to blindly pick a strip of paper.

Roberto Matta

Arshile Gorky

Jackson Pollock

Mark Rothko

Robert Motherwell

Pavel Tchelitchew

Ivan Albright

Vera Berdich

Charles Howard

Joseph Cornell

Isamu Noguchi

Marcel Duchamp

Salvador Dali

Joan Miro

De Chirico

Helen Lundberg

Kurt Seligmann

Charles Seliger

Federico Castellon

Charles Rain

Yves Tanguy

André Masson

Max Ernst

Explain to students that their task is to locate and research one piece of art created by their artist using accessible resources. Based on this piece, pairs will answer, to the best of their ability, the following questions:

-What are some important biographical facts about the artist?

-What is the title of your selected piece of art? What does the title suggest about its meaning?

-When was the artwork created? What were some important events or considerations during this period of time that may have influenced the artist?

-In what medium was the piece of art created?

-What do you think the piece of art “means” or “symbolizes”?

-What do art critics or other art consumers think about the meaning of this piece of work?

-What makes the piece of art “surrealistic”?

Students should take notes as they gather information about their particular piece of artwork and then use it to write the text of an audio guide designed for young adults. The recording should run no longer than 2-3 minutes. If possible, students may record their text.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Once pairs have finished writing and/or recording their text, students should display their selected pieces of artwork (as printed images) in the style of a museum gallery and read (or play from a recording) their text aloud. If equipment is available, students may even walk around with handheld tape players or other audio players to simulate the audio guide experience. The class should then verbally summarize and discuss overall impressions of the Surrealism art movement, in light of their research and discoveries.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-What makes someone an “artist”? Can anyone and everyone be an “artist”?

-What is the origin of the word “art”?

-Should art be taught in all schools? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, thoughtful participation in class discussions, cooperation in small groups, and creativity and accuracy in writing the text of an audio guide about a particular artist’s work.

Extension Activities:

1. What genres of art are you particularly attracted to, and why? Browse art books to see what categories of art appeal to your interests. Then design a PowerPoint presentation that describes particular pieces from this genre and what aspects about it are interesting to you.

2. Select a subject that is taught in kindergarten, such as the alphabet or counting, and design a children’s book that speaks to this subject. For example, how would you use a Surrealist painting in an alphabet book that engages young children? Try out your book in an elementary school class, if possible.

3. Produce an illustrated timeline of the Surrealism movement that chronologically and visually portrays the development of the art work in this style through the years. Provide captions to elucidate main points of emphasis.

4. Select one of the artists mentioned in the article and write a brief and engaging biography of his or her life. Alternatively, write a letter to one of the artists mentioned in the article. What questions might you have for him or her? What comments might you like for him or her to hear?

5. Visit a local art museum. Write a guide for teens and other young people describing ways to enjoy the art. How would you suggest for a young person to walk through an exhibit? What would you suggest that a teen might consider when looking at an artwork?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics – One of the reasons that not all the desired pieces of art were available for the exhibit is that “loans fell through.” Visit a local museum or gallery and interview a curator. Inquire about the business aspects of designing and commissioning an exhibit. What are all the financial considerations involved in this production, such as artist fees, licensing costs, insurance, etc.? Design a pie chart, based on your interview, that indicates the budget of a typical museum exhibit.

Media Studies – View a biographical movie about an artist, such as “Pollack” (2000), “Basquiat” (1996), or “Frida” (2002). Based on these films, respond to the following questions in a film review: What is the image of an “artist”? How do the films capture this personal development? What aspects of the artists’ lives make them “tormented” or “starving” artists, if at all?

Teaching with The Times – Over the next few weeks, clip articles about new exhibits or productions described in the New York Times Arts section. Using your clippings, write a social commentary about the types of art that are currently being presented to the general public. Why do you think these current shows or exhibits speak to the contemporary art consumer? Does an exhibit always need to have a popular following to be a success? How do the current times influence the types of art we may be interested in viewing? To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.
