The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit yesterday denied requests, at least for now, by four New York City politicians to be freed on bail, as they continued to appeal convictions on charges that they trespassed on a federal military installation on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. The four men demonstrated against Navy bombing exercises there last month.

Lawyers for the four -- the Rev. Al Sharpton, City Councilman Adolfo Carrión Jr., Assemblyman José Rivera and Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman -- said yesterday that they still hope to persuade the court in Boston to approve their release on bail. But the preliminary order suggested that the so-called Vieques Four could end up serving out their whole terms of 90 days for Mr. Sharpton and 40 days for the other three.

''I am stunned,'' said Max D. Stern, a Boston lawyer aiding in Mr. Sharpton's appeal. ''They are no more danger to the community than was Rosa Parks when she committed her act of civil disobedience.''

All four announced plans this week to begin liquid-only hunger strikes during their detention at a federal jail in Brooklyn, as a way to sustain their protest against the Navy's use of a bombing range on Vieques.
