I plan on drawing the invitation myself, with Sissy's help. If a person needs to take a Valium before they come, fine. I don't want nobody flipping out. If they feel like they can't handle it, they need to leave.

And I can't do it on a birthday. Because, to me, the birthday is the only day worth celebrating really, other than Halloween. I'm trying not to go on a day that will make sadness happen in their heads.

I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever in my life be put in a residential care home, a nursing home. You're not even allowed to resuscitate me on the spot. I've got it set up. I'm not going to the hospital. Sorry, ain't doing that. No. They strip you of all your dignity and I'm sorry that they do.

My training with the elderly and dealing with death gives me a different attitude. I don't look at it as a negative thing. I've had a very interesting life. Life has been an adventure. I don't see why I should have to wither in pain. I've watched people wither in pain. I've bagged and tagged people a lot in my life. That's what we call it, bag and tag.

In reality, I'm not dying any quicker than anybody else -- because you never have more than just this second, and that's all you have. It's just right now. And you may be gone. Who knows? You don't have to be ill. A bug comes along and flies through your room and bites you and in a split second, you know. Or anything. Walk in front of a car or anything. And that's the way I think about life. So, it's a lot easier for me to let go of it because of the way I feel about it, I think.

If life is a continuum, I go to the next step. If life isn't a continuum, then what difference does it make?
