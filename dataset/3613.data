Re ''Just Refinanced That Mortgage? Maybe It's Time to Do It Again'' (Spending It, Jan. 18):

A worksheet accompanying the article looked at the time needed to recover the costs of refinancing a home mortgage. But it left out three important factors that lengthen that period and can thus make refinancing look less desirable:

* The tax deductibility of interest payments. Say that a refinancing reduces your total mortgage payments from $25,000 a year to $23,000. That doesn't mean you've saved $2,000. When interest payments are reduced, your tax deductions are also reduced. If your marginal tax rate -- Federal, state and city -- is 40 percent, your after-tax savings in this case will be closer to $1,200.

* The cost of losing the use of your money. Say you pay $3,000 in closing costs on this same refinancing. If you had instead put that money in a bank account, where it earned just 2.5 percent interest after taxes, you would reap an additional $75 a year. That money should also be subtracted from your potential savings from refinancing.

* The cost of your time. It takes many hours to gather financial records, complete the application forms for the refinancing and attend the closing -- typically held during business hours.

An accurate calculation of the potential savings from refinancing depends on a borrower's tax bracket and the age of the existing loan. Only if all relevant factors are considered can a borrower determine whether refinancing makes any sense for him.
