The Mandelring Quartet, from Germany, has won a handful of prizes since the early 1990's and has made a handful of recordings that range from standard repertory to rarities by Georges Onslow and contemporary works by Berthold Goldschmidt and Allan Pettersson. It should be better known in the United States, and the Frick Collection has been doing its part on the quartet's behalf: on Sunday afternoon, the collection presented it in its round chamber music room for the third time since 1994.

There is a lot to like about this group, starting with a taut, throaty tone, a fluid approach to color and an impeccable sense of style. The performance of Schubert's Quartet in G minor (D. 173) that opened the program was beefy and dramatic at first, but eventually countered this current of Romantic storminess in Schubert's style with a measure of clear-eyed Classicism. The Andantino and the Menuetto, in fact, had a Mozartean courtliness, and even the finale stopped short of returning to the Romanticism of the opening movement, reveling in a folksy briskness instead.

The warm, rounded sound of the Schubert was retained -- but also reconfigured -- in the group's account of Shostakovich's Quartet No. 4 (Op. 83). Shostakovich's lines pull toward an icy stridency, and the Mandelring players followed those impulses part of the way, stopping short of harshness but conveying all the work's wrenching energy.

That intensity, couched in an unambiguously warm glow, informed the group's performance of Beethoven's C sharp minor Quartet (Op. 131). This is Beethoven at his most mercurial, the connected movements shifting quickly between heart-tugging, bittersweet meditations and unalloyed playfulness. The musicians had the nimbleness that these sudden changes demand, as well as the ensemble precision to make the work's disparate movements cohere.
