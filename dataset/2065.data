I just watched the end of the Twins/Tigers game on ESPN. The Tigers won, 1-0. Marcus Thames hit a home run in the bottom of the eighth inning, and Jeremy Bonderman got the win. He’s 9-1. (Gary Sheffield didn’t play.)

Two thoughts crossed my mind. One is that, if the Indians maintain their 98-win pace and capture the Central, the Yankees won’t catch the Tigers for the wild card. The other is that the Tigers had to suffer a lot to be this good, and the Yankees have not suffered for 15 years.

When the Tigers dealt Jeff Weaver and his long-term contract to the Yankees in a three-way trade in 2002, they got back Bonderman, who then was 19 years old, from the Oakland A’s. They let him struggle in the majors for a while, and he was there when the Tigers lost 119 games in 2003. Their prize for such futility was an ace, Justin Verlander, who was drafted with the No. 2 pick overall the next season.

Then there’s Thames. He came up as a Yankee and was traded to Texas in ’03 for Ruben Sierra, who was useful for a while. The Tigers wound up with Thames, and they’re glad they have him now.

The Yankees, at 37-41, are going through growing pains. Clearly, because of their payroll, they’re built to win now. They have a dozen players under contract for $10 million or more this season. That’s the price of veterans with track records. And for years, that was basically the only kind of player the Yankees would seek.

They’d like to get younger, but it’s hard. They have Chien-Ming Wang, Melky Cabrera and Robinson Cano. They have Phil Hughes and a bunch of other live arms in the minors. But they have a real dearth of young position players.

Maybe the next chance they have to trade for a pitcher, they’ll look forward and take the Bonderman type instead of the Weaver type. Maybe they’ll hold onto the young, productive, and cheap position players like Thames, and give him a real chance.

The problem is, they’re still the Yankees, and they have a reputation to maintain, a cable network to feed, a new stadium coming the same year as the Mets’ new building, and a rabid fan base that pays lots of money to watch a team that’s competitive both now and in the future.

It’s a complicated vision GM Brian Cashman is trying to articulate, and if he keeps his job, it will be fascinating to see if he can pull it off. This year, clearly, it’s just not working.
