Lincoln Center's plaza will be transformed into a bazaar Sunday and Monday with more than 100 crafts exhibits, a variety of natural foods and enterment that will include puppet and magic shows, mimes and minstrels.

It's all being sponsored by a group called American Concern for Artistry and Craftmanship, which formed itself more than a year ago to tackle some of the problems that confront creative artisans in urban environments.

For example, the group hopes to provide free temporary work space for artists as well as a ceramic studio and a print shop, where artists new to the city or to their work can get started before establishing their own quarters.

Also planned is a program of interest‚Äêfree loans, a library, a meeting and exhibition space, a list of inexpensive or free resources for artists in the city and a center where members may trade services with one another.
