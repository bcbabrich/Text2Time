Each of the county's four Assembly Districts had its own suffragette leader, including Mrs. Arthur Livermore of Yonkers, Mrs. Leigh French of New Rochelle, Mrs. Marshall Backon of Tarrytown and Adelaide Goan of Katonah.

There was also S. J. Russell, a leader of the White Plains suffrage association who, in 1914, organized a ''baby-checking'' service to encourage women to vote in local town and village elections, a right they had gained earlier in the century.

Despite the early efforts, however, a measure giving women the right to vote in state elections was defeated in 1915, a result that prompted Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, a Tarrytown physician and the first female Methodist minister in the country, to declare: ''It's absolutely impossible to lose what you never possessed.''

The movement resumed in earnest, and two years later Westchester suffragettes spotted an unusual opportunity. Under the direction of Mrs. Vanderlip, they agreed to assemble volunteers to take the World War I ''military census'' of able-bodied men in the county, a process involving surveying 320,000 residents and saving thousands of dollars.

As The New York Sun declared approvingly in its April 29, 1917, issue, ''One of the common reproaches against suffragettes is that they are not interested in anything but getting the vote. The Woman's Suffrage Party is disproving the accusation.''

In an interview with the Sun, Mrs. Vanderlip demonstrated that she had weighed the costs carefully against the benefits of the effort. ''War today is not the business of a group of fighting men but the affair of a whole people,'' Mrs. Vanderlip said. ''It has revolutionized the curiously antiquated arguments about women's suffrage.'' Although she also said the census effort would be concluded ''without any thought of propaganda,'' she added: ''I can't help feeling that in the end this work and all the work which women may be called on to do in this national crisis will unavoidably influence public opinion in that direction.''

Following the state success, Mrs. Catt organized the New York State League of Women Voters, a move that prompted her to say: ''What are we going to do? We know nothing about politics. We've got the vote. Now we must learn to use it.'' When presiding over league meetings these days, Marion F. Finek, a Chappaqua resident and current president of the State League of Women Voters, uses Mrs. Catt's gavel, originally a gift to the suffragette from a fellow sympathizer, Susan B. Anthony.
