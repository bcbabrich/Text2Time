On the cover of Manhattan's basketball media guide, ''Home Sweet Home'' appears above a photo of the Jaspers' new head coach, John Leonard. Those words apparently have a double meaning.

Last night, Manhattan proved to St. Peter's College that Draddy Gymnasium is very sweet by routing the Peacocks, 73-54, before 1,021 fans.

Six of Manhattan's seven victories this season have been at home and their .877 winning percentage there ranks them first in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and 14th in the nation.

''I'm not sure what it is,'' Leonard said of Draddy Gymnasium, the court where he played from 1978-1982 as a guard for the Jaspers. ''It's a tough place for other teams to play. I don't think that it is as much a confidence thing as it is an attitude thing for us when we play here.''
