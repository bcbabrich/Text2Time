Does lightning strike twice?

Robert F. X. Sillerman drew admiration for his financial instincts in 1989 when he sold eight radio stations to the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company for $360 million, a deal then called the biggest ever in radio. He looked particularly prescient two years later when recession depressed broadcasting revenue for the first time in 30 years.

Now, nearly a decade later, Mr. Sillerman is selling again, and again getting top dollar.

Some industry analysts suggest Mr. Sillerman's action may signal that the peak of the radio market has been reached again. ''Sillerman is always a canny seller,'' said Gary G. Stevens, a radio station broker. ''He's not known for going early.''

Last week, Mr. Sillerman's company, SFX Broadcasting Inc., agreed to be acquired by Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst for $1.2 billion plus the assumption of about $920 million in debt. Steve Hicks, a principal in the Texas buyout company, was a founder of SFX with Mr. Sillerman. SFX's 71 stations would make the Capstar Broadcasting Corporation of Hicks, Muse the nation's largest radio broadcaster with 243 stations.

The $75-a-share purchase price for SFX amounts to 16 times what analysts estimate for the company's 1998 cash flow. Historically, radio station prices have been based on a multiple of 8 or 10 times cash flow. But multiples have escalated rapidly during a swift 18 months of consolidation since Federal rules on ownership limits were eased. On Friday, SFX shares closed at $73.375 each, up 25 cents.
