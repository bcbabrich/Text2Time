Plenty of readers, including many teachers, were indignant at my Sunday column calling for easier accreditation of teachers in public schools. Here’s a sampling….Ann writes: “I taught art with an alternative certification….the principal who hired me wanted an artist instead of an art teacher…. I loved the job. I loved the kids. After getting my first paycheck I realized I could not make ends meet, or even come close on my teachers paycheck. I had to work two jobs. When my photo lab bill was more than my take home pay I had to leave teaching so I could support my own children…. Alternative certification is great, but until teachers are paid what they are worth you will never fill the classrooms with the teachers our children deserve, certified or otherwise.”

Steve from New York writes: “I completely agree with your observations in the above cited article. Schools of Education should be abolished. I never met a teacher who learned anything useful in an education course. [I have] 40 years experience teaching H.S. Biology.”

Caroline writes: “The reason there are so many requirements for teachers to be certified is to make money for colleges. If teachers have to continue to go to school over a thirty year career, colleges make money. Bottom line: I have taught for thirty-five years. You are correct in your observation that we aren’t getting the best and brightest young people. None of our daughters have gone into teaching. Pay has to be increased, and the blame has to be put elsewhere for the failure of children….By the way, more knowledge doesn’t mean a better teacher. Colin Powell would last one day in my inner city second grade. He would not have lasted an hour in my eighth grade classes.”

Martha from Seattle writes: “Unless you’re quite wealthy, it’s hard to leave a conventional job for a teaching job. Getting a certificate just isn’t that hard — it’s supporting a family on less than $40,000 a year that is. When we start paying teachers more, we will have more of them. And if we pay them well enough, we will once again attract the best and brightest to the field.”

Jack, a principal from Fresno, CA, writes: “Perhaps if we increased salaries for teachers, more smart people would be inclined to work in our profession.”

Miriam from Warwick writes: “Your article confuses the issues. First, current teaching programs for the most part fail to yield competent professionals. Ask any parent in a public school. That needs to be fixed. The solution to that problem is not uncertified professionals. Second, most students leave college with enormous debt. Even if the student wants to teach, teaching salaries are less than adequate to service that debt, so there is no choice about teaching. Again, the solution is not uncertified professionals. It is certainly possible to draft guidelines for advanced degree candidates who are not otherwise certified to teach. The truth is that most school districts are opposed to this because the NEA, the certified teacher’s union, won’t agree.”

Julie from Sturgeon Bay, WI writes: “While Meryl Streep would likely make a dynamite acting teacher, the idea of solving America’s teacher shortage by relaxing certification requirements seems quaint. As a teacher, I believe the real issue is our nation’s lack of commitment to education. We should scrap the moronic No Child Left Behind, take some of our ridiculous military budget and shift it to education, reduce class size by half, and give teachers what they need to do their jobs, including a respectable salary! Respecting professional educators would go a long way towards recruiting gifted teachers.”
