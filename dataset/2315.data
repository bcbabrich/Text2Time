CVS and Caremark Rx said Wednesday afternoon that they agreed to combine in what they described as a “merger of equals,” creating a company with about $75 billion in annual revenue. As is typical in such deals, though, one company emerged as the de facto buyer: CVS’s shareholders would end up owning a slight majority — 54.5 percent — of the enlarged company, and Caremark shareholders would turn in their stock in exchange for CVS shares, the companies said.

The announcement came a few hours after CVS, a drug-store chain, and Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager, confirmed a report in The New York Times that they were in talks about a possible transaction.

In Wednesday’s deal, each Caremark share would be exchanged for 1.67 shares of CVS, the companies said in a press release. The combined company would be called CVS/Caremark and have its headquarters in Woonsocket, R.I., where CVS is based.

The exchange ratio seemed to take the markets by surprise, as shares of Caremark, which had been trading higher earlier in the day, fell sharply after the deal terms were announced. Caremark’s stock was down 2.7 percent in late-afternoon trading.

Caremark is the largest U.S. provider of pharmacy benefit management services, which involves administering drug benefits for individuals on behalf of big corporations, unions and other organizations.

CVS has 6,200 stores in the U.S. and also owns its own in-house pharmacy benefits management group.

Changes in the health-care landscape have forced many consumers to take a more-active role in decisions about buying prescription drugs, and CVS chief executive Tom Ryan said Wednesday that combining with Caremark would fit well with that trend. “Together, CVS and Caremark will help manage the costs and complexities of the U.S. healthcare system, offering unparalleled access and driving superior healthcare outcomes, enhancing value for employers, health plans and consumers,” he said in a press release.

As Reuters pointed out, benefits managers such as Caremark have also posed a threat to brick-and-mortar pharmacies by mailing prescription drugs directly to consumers. For CVS, then, the Caremark deal would be a way to buy the competition.

Caremark’s financial advisers on the transaction were J.P. Morgan Chase and UBS; King & Spalding and Jones Day gave legal advice. CVS was advised by Evercore Group and Lehman Brothers, as well as law firms Davis Polk & Wardwell and Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo.
