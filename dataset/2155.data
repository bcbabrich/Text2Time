LUNCH IN A BEDOUIN HOME IN THE VILLAGE OF LAQIYYA, THE NEGEV, ISRAEL, SEPT. 22, 2005 Joyce MÃ¼ller, a former social worker, born in Michigan, now living in Barcelona with her husband, Hans Peter, center. They were there on behalf of Abraham Fund Initiatives, a group that works for peaceful coexistence between Arabs and Jews. "It was the best food I have ever eaten, because you could just sense the love that went into preparing it and serving it. I was surprised that the Bedouin women did not eat with us. But, apparently, they serve their guests first and, after the guests are satisfied and pleased, they themselves eat. My daughter worked in Africa for four years, so I'm used to eating with my hands. I love that you don't need the utensils. The bread does it all for you." As told to Austin Considine
