Spring flowers - next spring's - should be on the minds of gardeners now. It's time to make planting plans and to order bulbs. All bulbs, including the three showiest, trumpet daffodils, tulips and hyacinths, must be planted over the next two months. Although most small-flowered species are grown in nursery fields, some bulbs are being dug from the Mediterranean region, which threatens their survival. Conservationists, including the World Wildlife Fund, are asking gardeners who wish to avoid purchasing threatened-species bulbs to avoid packages marked ''Wild Origin.'' Here are some endangered bulbs. $ BULB DESCRIPTION Galanthus elwesii Giant snowdrop with emerald green blotches. Eranthis hymelis Winter aconite opens early with tiny buttercuplike flowers. Anemone blanda Grecian windflower propagated by many growers, but some are still being dug from the wild. Cyclamen species Dainty windswept flower grown domestically, though some are still dug from the wild.
