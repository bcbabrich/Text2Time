Each August, Pierre Filiatre's beloved France is overrun with the British, the Germans, the Dutch, the Italians and now the Russians. All crowd into this corner of the Riviera where he has been coming year after year, for more than 30 years.

Content to vacation in his own country, he does not understand why other people cannot do the same. He shares that view with others in France, who may be the most stay-at-home people in Western Europe.

''I was talking with some of the other guys here and we were asking each other, 'Why don't they stay home?' '' he said as he padded around his patio in flip-flops and multicolored swim trunks patterned like a Mondrian painting.

Mr. Filiatre, 77, does not live the high life associated with Cannes and St.-Tropez. He is more the equivalent of an aging American Joe Six-Pack summering in an R.V. park, who is fiercely attached to his native land. The only vacation he has ever taken away from France was to Austria, which he said he liked because it reminded him of his main home, in the Jura Mountains.
