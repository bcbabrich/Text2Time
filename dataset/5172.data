Many political analysts here say the political tensions that led to the vote, coupled with the vote-buying by both sides that is said to have developed ahead of Wednesday's session of the 236-member Assembly, seem to be poor omens for the survival of democratic government in a country that has been under military rule for 24 of its 42 years. Ms. Bhutto's administration was formed after a general election last November, ending more than a decade of military rule.

Since the no-confidence motion was introduced last week, causing Ms. Bhutto to return hurriedly from abroad, scenes have developed that have bordered on farce. In one incident, a potential defector from Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party arrived at the airport in Islamabad, the capital, to find himself being pulled in opposite directions by angry, scuffling delegations from the Bhutto party and the Islamic Democratic Alliance, the main opposition group.

Later, an Alliance member of Parliament, in an Islamabad hospital, was given a guard of 35 armed policemen, apparently to sequester him from colleagues intent on keeping him from defecting, before he was moved secretly.

In a bid to cement their positions, both sides removed all the members of Parliament they could find to tightly patrolled hillside resorts in the mountainous country outside Islamabad. The Bhutto loyalists are in Swat, 75 miles northwest of here, while Alliance followers are holed up in Murree, 40 miles northeast of the capital.

Still, reports of huge bribes continue to swirl around the capital. One of the few legislators available to speak to reporters, an opposition member, said that she feared being abducted, or killed, on her way to vote.
