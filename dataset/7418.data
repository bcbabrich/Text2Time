TO THE EDITOR:

I applaud Dr. Foster's suggestion that we reevaluate our physical fitness programs, but I am concerned that the casual reader will conclude that now he can with good stop exercising. This is not so. We cannot stop moving because to live is to move. Let us learn to do it as efficiently and lly as possible and at the same time learn to conserve the human body.

Women, whom Dr. Foster dismissed in a brief two‐sentence paragraph, have probably come closer to realizing this than men. Women know that the shape given to them by nature must be carefully cultivated throughout the years and that the only way this can really be done is through proper diet and effective g. As a result of g, they sense a greater feeling of well‐being and remain younger‐in looks and in feeling.

One element of aging is loss of flexibility. Regain and increase that element and a great deal has been achieved. Could all this have something to do with women outliving men ?
