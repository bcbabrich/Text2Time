''Personal Bankruptcy Filings Rise on L.I.'' (Sept. 10) was informative and helpful. However, I would like to correct the impression that there are no nonprofits on Long Island to assist people with financial counseling.

In Nassau County, Family Service Association has had a family financial counseling program for more than 10 years. The program helps clients develop a monthly budget, stop spending and pay back debt. In short, the association helps clients find alternatives to bankruptcy. Interested parties may call 516-485-4600. Residents of Suffolk County can find help through Family Service League, headquartered in Huntington. Ann Codey Family Financial Counselor Famly Service Association Hempstead
