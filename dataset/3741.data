Most people -- linguists included -- ignore 10 percent of all conversation, the ums, likes, false starts and repetitions that litter spontaneous speech.

Until recently, these utterances were considered garbage that hindered communication.

But a study due to appear in the Journal of Memory and Language argues that the word ''oh,'' when used in the middle of a sentence, is not a bad habit, but in fact plays a pivotal role in comprehension.

'' 'Oh' subconsciously alerts the listener to remember a previously mentioned, but then abandoned, idea,'' said the study's author, Dr. Jean E. Fox Tree, an assistant professor in the department of psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz. ''It helps the listener piece together the concepts in the conversation.''

Dr. Fox in her study asked 180 male and female students at Santa Cruz to listen to tapes of unrehearsed speech. In one experiment, subjects were told to push a button when they heard the name Roosevelt. They then listened to a speaker first discuss past presidents, then switch to another topic.
