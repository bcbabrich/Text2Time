Hampton had been out of camp for 13 days and was fined a total of $52,000.

"I did what I had to do to get them to see I was serious about a new contract," Hampton said. His agent, Ralph Cindrich of Pittsburgh, said Hampton's no-show was an "attention getter." Said Cindrich: "He showed up on Friday night and told the coaches that his attitude was good, that he was upbeat, and he was ready to play."

As of several months ago, the top five running backs in the league made on average about $1.7 million a year. Thurman Thomas, Buffalo's superb running back, recently signed a four-year, $13.5 million deal to make him the highest paid running back in the league. For now. The Cowboys' Emmitt Smith is currently holding out and wants more money than Thomas (actually he wants about $4 million a season).

Right now, the highest paid player in the N.F.L. is San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, who makes over $5 million a year.

The debate around the league focuses on the questions: Is a running back worth that kind of money? Where will Hampton's salary end up? Right now, it's unclear, but when all is said and done, he will be much richer than now. He's earned it.

Hampton, a 1990 first-round draft pick, has rushed for 1,000 yards in each of the past two seasons, making him only the second Giants player to do so (Joe Morris was the other in 1985 and 1986). He has 2,655 career rushing yards in just three seasons, already good enough for the No. 8 spot on the Giants' career list. And this is only his fourth season.
