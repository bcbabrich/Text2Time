Christopher Keene, the general director of the New York City Opera, will conduct the company's new production of "Regina," replacing William Henry Curry, who withdrew on Friday for what a company spokeswoman described as personal reasons. "Regina," with a score and libretto by Marc Blitzstein, is an adaptation of the Lillian Hellman play "The Little Foxes." Performances are scheduled on Oct. 9, 18, 20 and 24.
