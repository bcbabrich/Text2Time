A landslide apparently caused by heavy rains engulfed a poor gold-mining village in northern Bolivia today, covering 150 homes and killing at least several dozen people, government officials said.

It was unclear early this evening how many people had died in the town, Chima, when the hillside from a nearby mountain gave way, sending a wall of mud and rocks over the Andean mining community. Search-and-rescue personnel had not yet reached the town, which does not have telephones and is more than 12 hours by treacherous mountain roads from La Paz, the capital.

''We have suffered a tragedy this morning,'' Jos√© Plata, an official of the local mining cooperative, told Bolivian radio. ''The losses are impossible to calculate.''

The governor of La Paz Province, Mateo Laura, initially told Bolivian reporters that the landslide might have killed 700 people and destroyed 400 homes. His office later revised the figure, saying perhaps up to 150 had disappeared.
