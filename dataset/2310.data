Just when we thought we’d seen and heard a lot in the Tennessee Senate race, along came two ads today that seem to dig even deeper into the divide on the Iraq war and terrorism.

The VoteVets group we’ve told you about before, which has used AK-47’s in its ads going after Republican senators, has a new ad up in Chattanooga. It never mentions a candidate, but its use of the phrase “Because of Iraq’’ is powerful as a refrain for a variety of problems with the war. Gen. Wesley Clark, the prominent military figure on the group’s advisory board, weighs in: “Because of Iraq, America is less secure.’’

Three Iraq war veterans speak first, and then the head of the group, Jon Soltz, an Iraq veteran himself, says:

But because we live in America, we do have a choice. We can fix our course in Iraq and find a much better way to keep America safe. Saying these things out loud is patriotic.

Then the type says:

Be an American Patriot.

Demand Change.

The voiceover: Don’t Be Silent Now.

Strangely enough, the Bob Corker campaign came out with an ad just before former President Bill Clinton arrived in Memphis for a campaign appearance with Mr. Corker’s opponent, Representative Harold Ford Jr.

It features a seven-year-old issue: Mr. Clinton’s pardon of members of the F.A.L.N., a Puerto Rican independence group convicted of federal crimes of seditious conspiracy, possession of an unregistered gun or interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle. Some were sentenced to more than 50 years in jail, and most had already served more than 19 years. They were responsible for many bombings, all in the name of the independence of the commonwealth.

This is an old issue, one that Hillary Rodham Clinton had to distance herself from as she mused a run for the Senate in New York at the same time her husband was considering granting them clemency.

The Corker ad asks: “Harold Ford Jr., tough on terrorism?

When Bill Clinton pardoned 16 members of a terrorist group responsible for 150 bombings and 6 U. S. deaths, the director of the F.B.I., Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and the Tennessee Congressional delegation all opposed the pardons. Well, all but one. Guess who? Harold Ford Jr.

That’s the real Harold Ford Jr.”

Totally bizarre bit of history to bring up now. The group’s actions date back through the 1980’s. Are we in a time warp?

Update 6 p.m.: There’s another ad, that just popped up this afternoon, in which Mr. Corker is repeating his attack on Mr. Ford’s close ties to his father, when it comes to Fannie Mae, for which the elder Ford is a lobbyist. Mr. Corker first lobbed this attack when we were in Chattanooga at one of the candidates’ debates. It ends with, “Troubled Family Ties, That’s the Real Harold Jr.”

In other Tennessee Senate news, Mr. Corker lent his campaign $2 million, which kicked in what is known as the Millionaire’s Amendment _ under federal election law, which means the Ford campaign can seek more money from its donors.
