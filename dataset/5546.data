President Reagan has decided to sell more than $300 million worth of missiles to Saudi Arabia despite the strong possibility that the sale will be blocked by Israeli supporters in Congress, a senior White House official said today.

The official said the Saudis were concerned about recent successes by Iran in its war with Iraq because Iranian troops had moved close to Kuwait and the Persian Gulf oilfields.

''We're going to ask the Congress for it,'' the official said of the sale, ''on the grounds that the Saudis think they need it. They feel threatened right now with Iran seemingly pushing Iraq back and seizing Iraq territory. They are getting very close to Kuwait, and you know from Kuwait to the oilfields doesn't take that much time.''

The official said the arms package included advanced models of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the shoulder-held Stinger antiaircraft missile. Harpoon anti-ship missiles may also be included. The exact number of missiles was still being worked on, State Department officials said, but are said to include as many as 1,700 Sidewinders, 800 Stingers, and 100 Harpoon missiles.
