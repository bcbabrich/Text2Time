Those who care passionately about the rebuilding of downtown Manhattan now find themselves in an anxious limbo. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has promised that by mid-July, the public will see a half-dozen options for reclaiming ground zero. The waiting would be easier if we were totally confident that everyone else is waiting, too. The corporation chairman, John Whitehead, and Gov. George Pataki need to assure the public repeatedly that no developer, no advocate group, no politician is slipping through the back doors to wield insider clout while everyone else is standing quietly on the sidelines.

By offering the public a series of different visions for how to rebuild, officials hope to provoke debate and discussion. Those planners who are involved in creating these options promise that they will include some proposals that will be bold and provocative, as well as some that will seem very predictable and conservative. Every week it becomes clearer how difficult a task it will be to balance the concerns of all those who believe they own a part of Sept. 11. Families, residents, corporations, public authorities, politicians -- a wide range of New Yorkers all have their varying and sometimes conflicting demands. None of these groups alone can be permitted to control the future of this site.

Looking at the decision-making process from the outside, we can see the pressure building. Some business executives are lobbying hard for a large network of stores with covered streets so that stoplights and walk signs will not distract shoppers from their mission as consumers. If we are looking for a splendid urban plan that revives the area and restores the spirit, a mall is hardly the answer.

On the other side of the emotional spectrum are the families, many of whom are grieving and understandably see the site only as a place where their loved ones died. Mayor Michael Bloomberg expressed himself clumsily recently when he said that workers and residents do not want to live and work around a cemetery. Still, he revealed the concerns of many people who have their own large stake in the planning and revival of Lower Manhattan. As Madelyn Wils, a representative of downtown residents, put it last week, downtown should be revitalized, not consecrated.
