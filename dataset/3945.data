Buoyed by strong international tobacco profits and record market share for its Marlboro cigarette brand in the United States, the Philip Morris Companies reported fourth-quarter earnings yesterday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations.

Net income for the fourth quarter was up 16.5 percent, to $1.27 billion, or $1.53 a share, from $1.09 billion, or $1.27 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Earnings were a penny a share higher than many analysts had predicted.

Shares of Philip Morris fell $2.25 yesterday, closing at $92.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

"Tobacco was driving the company's earnings, and Philip Morris turned in a very good quarter," said Lawrence Adelman, a securities analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds.

Although international tobacco volumes were up only 1.1 percent, compared with especially strong results in the fourth quarter last year, international tobacco earnings in the quarter were up 21.6 percent, the company said.
