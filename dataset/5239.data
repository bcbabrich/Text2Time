FOR better and for worse, Abbey Simon has remained throughout his long career just on the edge of the artistic spotlight, maintaining on the basis of reliable readings of the standard piano repertory a reputation unaffected by shifting musical tastes. Mr. Simon plays in a fluid, polished, self-effacing way, and his performances can be counted on to provide at least reasonable satisfaction and pleasure. They fall into no particular interpretative camp but pursue their own sensible, straightforward path.

If this sounds like tepid praise, it is not intended that way, although Mr. Simon occasionally plays in a manner that leaves a listener puzzled and disappointed. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debut, the pianist returned there on Sunday evening and presented a program of works by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Ravel -bringing to them all nothing less than the note-perfect, intelligently crafted interpretations for which he is known, yet investing none of them with the sort of individualistic twist that would transform his performances into distinctive, memorable experiences.

To his considerable credit, Mr. Simon conceives works in large, sweeping arches, never allowing himself to become bogged down by the small, fussy inflections that might disrupt the flow of the music. In Mendelssohn's ''Song Without Words'' in C (Op. 67, No. 4) and in the final movement of Beethoven Sonata in G (Op. 14, No. 2), the pianist paddled smoothly through the streams of fast, swirling notes. He glided across the pristine surfaces of Ravel's eerie ''Oiseaux tristes'' and mastered the formidable intricacies and Spanish rhythms of the composer's ''Alborada del gracioso.''

Elsewhere, however, his playing sounded almost frustratingly benign, with the ordinarily disputatious Chopin B-flat minor Sonata - a score full of conflicted emotions - passing under Mr. Simon's hands without raising much of a fuss at all.
