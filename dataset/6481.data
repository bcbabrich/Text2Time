The last Wagner administra tion holdover on the City Plan ning Commission began yester day an effort to pressure Mayor Lindsay into reappointing her.

MRS. SPATT FIGHTS TO RETAIN CITY JOB

Mrs. Beverly Moss Spatt, the seven‐member commission's only woman member, called a City Hall news conference to argue that her role as a fre quent dissenter represented the very sort of thing Mr. Lindsay had praised during the recent political campaign.

“Mr. Lindsay has faulted Mr. Agnew and Mr. Nixon for elim inating all dissent within their administration,” she said, add ing: “I'm not a politican. Maybe that's been one of my mistakes.”

Then she picked out two points that could pose political problems for Mayor Lindsay should he let her leave the commission when her term ex pires Dec. 31.
