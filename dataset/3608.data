TAKE an analytical surgeon who would rather be a metaphysician. Add a prominent playwright who extracts drama from a doctor's private and professional dilemma. Pair him with a director for whom confronting audiences with the unspoken mysteries of life is more important than offering a real good time.

Such are the uncommon associations from which ''A Question of Mercy,'' by David Rabe, has evolved. The Long Wharf Theater in New Haven is the current stop in the journey of a potent play. New Haven is also the home town of Dr. Richard Selzer, whose confessional essay about his wrenching involvement in one man's plea to end his own life, inspired Mr. Rabe's flesh and blood dramatization.

The artistic collaboration between the playwright -- a Lakeville resident perhaps best known for ''Sticks and Bones,'' ''Hurlyburly'' and ''Streamers'' -- and the director, Doug Hughes, evolved when a one-act version of ''A Question of Mercy'' was staged by Mr. Hughes for a Lincoln Center workshop. It was then expanded and reshaped for the theater. When the play had its premiere a year ago at the New York Theater Workshop in the East Village, the reviewers' adjectives ranged from shattering and gripping to banal and obvious.

One scene, in which the character of Susannah, a friend of the dying man and his male lover, is introduced, has been rewritten for the Long Wharf production, which Mr. Hughes has reconceived from a proscenium to a thrust stage, with an almost entirely new ensemble. In a cast of seven, only Michael Kell -- who plays Eddie, the doorman -- was available for the new production.
