To the Editor:

Re ''Disparities Seen in Mental Care for Minorities'' (front page, Aug. 27):

You report that Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, said the stigma attached to mental illness in some minority cultures often causes a reluctance to use services.

A recent study in the American Journal of Public Health using data from the National Comorbidity Survey found that African-Americans with depression were more likely than whites with depression to say they would ''definitely go'' to seek mental health services, and that African-Americans with severe psychiatric disorders were less likely than whites with the same disorders to say they were ''somewhat embarrassed if friends knew they sought care.''

The stigma is real, but so is widespread willingness to use accessible, appropriate care if it is provided.
