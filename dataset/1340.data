THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — Some days you get the puzzle, some days the puzzle gets you. Today I got the puzzle, and although you can’t see it, I’m doing a happy dance.

I would like to point out here that this post represents a milestone of sorts, because even though I like Brendan Emmett Quigley very much and work with him, I have always found it difficult to crack his puzzles. It’s not that I haven’t wanted to; Mr. Quigley’s grids are immensely fun and always have a full range of the liveliest clues. I just don’t know everything that he does, and he knows an interesting assortment of things.

Today’s puzzle sends you all over the place, but in a really good way. Some people would read the news about the controversial BORDER STATES that abut other countries and think, “Huh. We really do have some wacky problems in this country”, and that would be it. A crossword puzzle constructor looks at that phrase and thinks, “Hey, I could put a bunch of states along the border of a grid and wouldn’t it be rad if they actually WERE border states!” Yes, our brains work differently.

Not only that, but we have also clues that are highly original and run the gamut from Beyoncé all the way back to Eric the Red. Who else would take a mundane Roman numeral entry (CML) and bring Vikings into it?

I also liked the clue for a word like IDEA. Some people might give an entry like this a dictionary-type clue, but not Mr. Quigley. Instead, we have a lovely quote by Matisse: “Drawing is putting a line round an IDEA.” I tried doing that with this blog post, but all I got was a rectangle. I guess I need to work on my ideas.

Nicely done, Mr. Quigley.

To take us out, how about something nice and easy? We don’t do too much here at Wordplay that’s nice and easy, but perhaps Tina Turner (writer of 52 Across) can show us how:
