''As soon as I heard the record, I caught the songwriting fever once and for all and decided I belonged on Tin Pan Alley - you couldn't tear me away from the profession after that,'' he said.

Mr. Parish estimates he collaborated with at least a hundred different composers over the years. Though his writing techniques, have varied from situation to situation, his approach toward lyrics has been quick and intuitive.

''In many cases, I was given both a tune and a title,'' he said. ''Sometimes I would write a 'dummy' lyric, with words that didn't mean anything, in order to get the rhythmic flow. Then I would come up with the actual words. Occasionally a dummy lyric ends up being the final lyric. Irving Caesar's 'Tea for Two' is a famous example.

''Once I had a title, I would take it home, walk around with it for awhile to let it percolate and then sit down to write. The actual writing time was usually a half hour to an hour. I didn't believe in laboring over a lyric too much, because the song would sound too worked over.''

Mr. Parish found working with a predetermined title to be a nuisance, albeit one that sometimes yielded artistic dividends. In the lyrics of both ''Star Dust,'' and ''Sophisticated Lady,'' the actual song titles aren't repeated in the catch phrases of the chorus but occur almost incidentally in the narrative, helping to sustain the smooth natural flow of imagery. The lyric of ''Star Dust'' is especially striking in the way the verse seems to begin in the middle of a thought: ''. . .And now the purple dust of twilight time, steals across the meadows of my heart.''

The history of ''Star Dust'' illustrates Mr. Parish's belief that songs that are overnight sensations tend to be quickly forgotten while those that come to be recognized as standards often have a longer, quieter gestation in the public consciousness.

Hoagy Carmichael wrote and recorded the melody for ''Star Dust'' in 1927 as a jazz instrumental heavily influenced by Bix Beiderbecke. Mr. Parish wrote the lyric in 1929, and it became a hit the following year in a recording by Isham Jones, the tenor saxophonist, bandleader and songwriter (''I'll See You in My Dreams,'' ''It Had to Be You'') who led one of the most popular orchestras of the pre-swing era. The following year Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong also had minor hit versions of the song.
