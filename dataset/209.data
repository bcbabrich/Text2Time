Too many cooks? Hardly. Teamwork has led to a commendable new cheese: Bone Char Square, initially developed by the chef Dan Barber to serve at Blue Hill at Stone Barns. The cow and goat milks for the cheese come from Old Chatham Sheepherding Company, the resulting cheese is aged at Crown Finish Caves in Brooklyn and Saxelby Cheesemongers is making it available. The ash covering each square is from the carbonization of bones used at Blue Hill for making stock. The cheese has a satiny texture, an earthy bouquet and a mild flavor with a distinctive goaty aftertaste.
