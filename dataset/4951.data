ENVIRONMENTAL companies in Europe are looking attractive, as a result of dirty water, dirty air, acid rain, hazardous waste, sewage and little room for landfills.

One of the pluses, analysts and executives say, is the growing pressure for central regulation of the environment in a united Europe, which is likely to mean stricter and more uniform standards in different countries so that, for example, a business in France does not have an advantage over a company in Germany.

But these analysts and executives warn that the environmental industry is still fragmented and immature. And they say that investment decisions must be made with caution and a long-term view. (Analysts of environmental stocks in the United States are also cautious now because the prices have already moved too high.) More important, European analysts say the euphoria over the profit potential should not spread to East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe, where the environment has suffered severely under 40 years of Communist rule. Because of a lack of money, analysts and executives do not expect real environmental business to develop in Eastern Europe until at least the mid-1990's.

''It's for the very brave,'' said David Owen, senior environmental analyst for Paribas Ltd. in London.
