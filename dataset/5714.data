A state judge has ordered a Baptist minister jailed on a contempt charge for defying a court order and refusing to turn over a church membership list to dissident members.

On Friday Judge Alfred Whitehurst of Circuit Court sentenced the pastor, the Rev. Milton Reid, to 30 days, plus 10 days for each day he refuses to turn over the list.

Mr. Reid's attorney, William Kunstler, said he would ask an appeals court in Richmond Monday to order the minister's release.

Mr. Reid, pastor of New Calvary Baptist Church, and about 200 of its members have been embroiled in legal battles since August 1982. The dissidents want the list, an audit finances and Mr. Reid's ouster.
