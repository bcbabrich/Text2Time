ORADELL, March 2—A 10‐year struggle by Bergen Catholic High School to gain membership in the Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League—a struggle involving civil rights, the energy crisis and rising school taxes—may be near climax.

Now composed of nine public schools‐six in Bergen County and three in Passaic Countythe athletic league has one opening, because Garfield dropped out. Eight schoolsBergen Catholic, Don Bosco of Ramsey, Passaic, Nutley, Belleville, Montclair, North Bergen and Bloomfield‐have applied for the vacancy, but none with the determination of Bergen Catholic of Oradell, which is run by the Christian Brothers of Ireland.

Aaron Halpern, princlpal of Clifton High School and president of the league, has called a meeting for his conference room tomorrow to hear a re port from the evaluators who have surveyed the eight applications. “We are not sure that we will take a vote, but we could,” Mr. Halpern said.

Originally, when Bergen Catholic applied for membership in 1985, the school was informed that participation in the league was limited by the group's constitution to public schools. Undeterred, the school persisted in submitting applications, and finally in 1974 sought relief from the State Division of Civil Rights, accusing the league of discrimination.
