The chairmen of three regional telephone companies said today that they planned to spend at least $300 million starting a video programming venture with the Creative Artists Agency, raising questions about the agency's growing power in Hollywood.

The venture would mark the largest effort by the Baby Bells to compete against cable systems by using phone lines into homes to allow subscribers to call up entertaiment. The venture hopes to reach nearly 20 million customers over the next five years. Today's announcement also solidified the powerful standing in Hollywood of Michael Ovitz, chairman of the Creative Artists Agency, who was hired by the Baby Bells to shape the enterprise.

Mr. Ovitz's role in the venture seems to be far more muscular than even critics suspected. The announcement said that Mr. Ovitz and his agency, C.A.A. would develop marketing strategies for new programs as well as assisting the new company "establish relationships and assemble programming from the broadcast networks, cable programmers, studios, artists and producers." C.A.A. will also advise on "executive staffing, business development and entertainment industry alliances."

Mr. Ovitz's role in the venture has stirred considerable concern among some top movie studio executives, who said that the powerful agent was walking a delicate line between representing talent, on the one hand, and helping create shows and programs, on the other hand, that could give him enormous and unfair advantage over rivals. "Yes, we are concerned and we've expressed our concern to him and we're watching this very carefully," said the chairman of one of the major film studios.
