Bernadette Castro, the Republican candidate for United States Senate, said yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to persuade her during a private meeting at Gracie Mansion on Sunday night to "consider distancing" herself from her party's gubernatorial candidate, George E. Pataki.

Ms. Castro, a long-time friend and financial contributor to the Mayor, told reporters at an impromptu news conference on Fifth Avenue that she refused. "I'm a member of the Republican ticket," she said. "George Pataki is the head of the ticket. If I didn't think he would be a good governor, I wouldn't have joined the ticket in the first place."

Providing a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes wrangling inside the Republican Party, Ms. Castro attributed the Mayor's decision to cross party lines and support Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, to his long-running tensions with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who helped engineer Mr. Pataki's candidacy.

"Look, we're all grownups in this," she said, contending that the real dispute was not between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani. "It's between Alfonse and Rudy. That's what it's all about. Rudy doesn't want Alfonse controlling the Republican Party."
