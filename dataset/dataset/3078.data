Educators who work with immigrant students are cautioning that the New York City Board of Education may have a hard time teaching parents about the choices they have to make now that the bilingual education system is being overhauled.

The parents, several educators said, are often intimidated by school bureaucracy and often do not have the time to tend to their children's education.

The Board of Education voted unanimously on Tuesday to give parents of students who speak little English the chance to choose whether their children go into standard bilingual classes, where most classes are taught in a native language, an English as a second language program, where English is dominant, or two newer options, a more intensive English as a second language program and a program in which students may be taught in Spanish one day and English the next.

The change came after critics charged that parents did not have control over whether to place their children in bilingual or E.S.L. classes and were often not informed about their choices. About 160,000 of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren are enrolled in either bilingual or E.S.L. classes, with roughly half the total in each program.
