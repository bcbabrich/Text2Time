Asked if he would remain with the Oregon Project, Brazier said: “Yeah, if Pete takes control.”

Hours earlier, shortly before midday, the United States track and field governing body confirmed it had acted upon the international federation’s recommendation and taken back Salazar’s credentials, barring him from all championship sites, including training venues and official hotels.

Salazar, who denies all the allegations against him, was reported to have left town shortly after the ruling, which detailed violations that included trafficking in testosterone, tampering with the doping control process and administering improper infusions of L-carnitine, a naturally occurring substance that converts fat into energy.

Even after allegations of wrongdoing first surfaced in 2015, Salazar, head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, continued to loom large. He has trained stars like Mo Farah of Britain, a four-time Olympic champion; Galen Rupp, the top American marathon runner; and Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who set a world record in the women’s mile in July and just this weekend won gold in the 10,000 meters in Doha.

“I am shocked to receive the news of today’s ruling, especially during this time in which I am fully preparing for my next race in the world championships in Doha,’’ Hassan said in a statement. “This investigation is focused on the period before I joined the Oregon Project and therefore has no relation to me. I was aware of the ongoing investigations when I joined the team and have always had a clean conscience, knowing we are being monitored to the absolute fullest by USADA and WADA,” the American and world antidoping authorities.

In Houston, some 8,000 miles from the world championships, a mild-mannered cross-country coach named Steve Magness absorbed the news.

His life changed five years ago when he began speaking out about the questionable coaching tactics that he saw Salazar using at the Oregon Project, where Magness served as an assistant coach and top scientist. A top miler in high school, Magness was in his mid-twenties when Salazar recruited him to Oregon in late 2010. Magness was gone by the summer of 2016, mere months before two of Salazar’s runners, Farah and Rupp, won gold and silver in the 10,000 meters at the London Olympics.

Magness is now the head cross-country coach and an assistant track coach at the University of Houston, but in running circles he is best known as the main whistle-blower on Salazar’s use of performance-enhancing drugs and prohibited medical procedures at the Oregon Project.
