Financial fire fighting and economic coordination are supposed to be specialties of the Group of Seven, as the consortium of the world's biggest industrial nations calls itself. But on both counts the recent record of these nations -- the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- is looking less than impressive.

Indeed, some economists believe that its impact is in the process of being eclipsed by a lesser-known body of industrialized and developing nations which scored an economic success last week as the Group of Seven produced another disappointment.

At their annual spring session in Washington last week, finance ministers of the Group of Seven's member nations fell out over the Clinton Administration's indifference toward a weak dollar, with many complaining that turbulent currency markets are endangering world recovery.

Helmut Kohl, the Chancellor of Germany, had set the tone before the talks even started by saying American policy was "not acceptable." Lawrence H. Summers, an Under Secretary of the Treasury, hit back in an interview published with the Handlesblatt newspaper just after the talks by accusing the Germans of "always saying no." Lamberto Dini, Italy's Prime Minister and Finance Minister, termed the meeting "tense."
