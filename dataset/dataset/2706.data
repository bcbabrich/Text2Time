Howard Eisley stepped back and faded a bit, off balance but still confident that his 21-foot jumper would hit the spot. And why not?

Eisley, a 6-foot-2 guard for the Knicks, had hardly missed all night, making five 3-pointers and nearly matching his career high in scoring in just three quarters. So when his shot fell through the net with 48 seconds left against the Memphis Grizzlies tonight at The Pyramid, saving the Knicks from their second straight painful collapse, Eisley simply turned and ran downcourt, his face typically stoic.

But his teammates were excited about Eisley's timely shooting. Allan Houston shook his head in amazement and stared at him. Latrell Sprewell gave him a bearhug.

After all, it is not every day that a Knicks point guard scores 30 points. Eisley made 6 of 9 3-pointers, 12 of 15 shots over all, and scored 7 points in the final 2 minutes 2 seconds. He is the first Knicks point guard to score 30 since Mark Jackson on April 18, 1992. Eisley's scoring binge was not in vain. It sparked the Knicks to a 108-102 victory.
