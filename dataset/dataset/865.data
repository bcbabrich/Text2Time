TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — Welcome back after the holiday weekend! Hope you all had a wonderful time enjoying the last days of summer.

Hoo boy, I related to this one by Ethan Cooper. I’m sure I haven’t mentioned this more than a few dozen times, but The Girl is in college now, and she is costing me a fortune. Mr. Cooper has pleasantly reminded me of this in his COLLEGE EXPENSES theme, and fortunately for me, The Girl is not a BEER drinker. She does, however, have a six-page, single-spaced supply list just for her printmaking class alone. Whatever happened to the days of carving out a potato and dipping it in finger paint? Potatoes I can afford.

Fun fact: My heart stopped briefly when I saw the question mark in the revealer clue at 54 Across, because I thought it might be a pre-edit mark that somehow made it to publication, until I realized that it was a joke from Mr. Cooper and Will Shortz, who are questioning, as any parent would, whether BEER is really a legitimate expense.

Anyway, this puzzle was modern enough in its fill to enable any college student to finish it. I liked the fact that STEWIE of “Family Guy” makes his debut today, and we all get to learn that our beloved crossword rap star Snoop (nee) Dogg has embraced the RASTA movement and would like us all to call him Snoop Lion now.

In fact, all three of the theme entries and the revealer are making their debuts today, and I have to say that I just loved TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE. What a great 15.

Clue of the Day unreservedly goes to “Place where one can come home and chill?” for IGLOO.

Let’s hear from Mr. Shortz and Mr. Cooper:

Will Shortz’s Notes:

I’m very impressed with Ethan’s clues. Most of these are his. Lots of good ones, but my favorites are 10D, 12D (I did not know that!), 32D and 38D. I also like 64A, which is a tricky answer to handle. When I consider submissions, I pretty much ignore the constructors’ clues, which I know I can revise myself, if necessary. But I do give some preference to contributors (like Ethan) who I know write good clues, and I tend to publish their puzzles more quickly after acceptance.

Constructor’s Notes:

I have a really hard time coming up with themes, which is why I don’t construct too often. Much of the time, I try to think of an entry I’d like to see in the puzzle, and then try to build a theme around it. This was the case with TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE, which has the sexy 15-letter length and the X’s. Incidentally, although I am in grad school right now, I’m happy to say that it has been a long time since I actually had to buy a textbook. I have spent a small fortune on the library copier, however.

And now, we return to the days of higher learning, with the Marx Brothers:
