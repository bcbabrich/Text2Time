While the future of the North American operations of General Motors is in the hands of a federal bankruptcy judge, Opel and the rest of G.M.’s European business escaped that fate with help from the German government as well as Magna International, the Canadian-Austrian auto parts maker set to acquire Opel, Nelson D. Schwartz of The New York Times reports from Paris.

The German government, under heavy political pressure in an election year to save nearly 25,000 Opel jobs in Germany, brokered a deal over the weekend for an alliance led by Magna and the Russian bank Sberbank to acquire Opel and to provide 1.5 billion euros, or $2.1 billion, in bridge financing.

As a result, G.M.’s European operations, which include Opel, as well as Vauxhall, a venerable British brand, were not included in the American filing.

“With the financing, even with the G.M. actions in the U.S., we can now confidently say to our employees, customers, suppliers and dealers that it’s business as usual as we go through the process of creating a new, more independent Opel-Vauxhall,” said Carl-Peter Forster, the president of G.M. Europe. Mr. Forster will run the new company, to be known as Adam Opel.

However, non-German workers fear they could pay a huge price for Berlin’s role in providing crucial financing. As part of the deal, Magna is expected to try to keep German job losses down, which has set off complaints by union leaders in Britain and Belgium that local G.M. workers will bear the brunt of any layoffs.

More than 2,000 workers are employed at a G.M. plant in Antwerp that G.M. has long sought to close, as well as nearly 5,000 in Britain.

But Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, who must call for elections by the end of 2010, also vowed to protect G.M. workers at home.

“We are determined to save as many of the Vauxhall jobs as possible,” Mr. Brown told Sky News.

The tensions over the issue of protecting local workers versus sticking with the single market vision of the 27-member European Union are likely to continue even after the Magna deal for Opel is completed. France has also sought to safeguard auto jobs at home, infuriating newer members of the European Union in Central Europe that are home to auto plants.

Risking billions in loan guarantees and other aid for a single company has also stirred criticism. On Sunday, the German economy minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg offered his resignation and warned in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the “concept is not without risks for the state and the guarantees it has promised for Opel.”
