As for Ms. Rolle, her matriarch is made up largely of posings and sermonizings. ''You were supposed to be my beginning again,'' she rebukes her son. ''You were supposed to be my harvest.'' Who wouldn't go out for a drink?

More human are Lena's son, 35-year-old Walter Lee (Danny Glover) and his hard-working wife, Ruth (Starletta DuPois). Walter Lee, the household's solitary man, is at the center of the plot. Frustrated by his feelings of powerlessness, fed up with his job as a chauffeur, desperate to prove himself, he invests most of his father's insurance money with a neighborhood hustler. When Ruth, a part-time domestic worker, who wants mainly her husband's love, learns that she is pregnant (the audience learns it when she faints at the end of a scene, sure evidence of pregnancy in the theater), she is driven to consider an abortion.

Ms. DuPois doesn't have much to do except show distress at distressing events, but she manages to seem solid and believable. Mr. Glover does enough emoting for both of them. He carries conviction in his quieter moments, but much of the time he is contorting his big frame and throwing himself around the furniture and on the floor; he rants incessantly and perspires prodigiously. When he hears that his mother is planning to use the insurance payment to buy a house instead of entrusting the money to him, he crunches a glass in his hand, sure evidence of agitation in the theater.

Egged on by the emotion-wringing direction of Bill Duke, all the characters keep yelling at one another or weeping with one another about money, independence, family pride and so forth. They seem not to trust the audience to detect a feeling unless it is shouted or bawled. The camera, often stopping the action to hold a reaction and lingering over limp jokes, accentuates the play's weaknesses and strains the patience of even a sympathetic viewer.

Mr. Duke sensibly does not try to open things up by taking the characters out of their apartment, but he has been unable to resist shooting periodically through a kitchen window so that Lena's favorite plant, sitting symbolically on the sill in a bit of sun, can occupy the foreground.
