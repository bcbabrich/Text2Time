''There were a number of obstacles that were deliberately placed in our path by the Government,'' he said.

''We have clear evidence that Government agents intimidated the population in the sense of going out and warning people not to talk to us, systematically interrogating people who did talk to us and in some cases making direct threats to people who they knew had given information to us.

''Demonstrations were organized against us in various cities, including the capital. In some case we have direct evidence of Government involvement in what they referred to as spontaneous demonstrations.''

The team met the most serious protests in Mbandaka, a town in western Congo where refugees had fled to escape pursuers from the east. Mr. Brody was one of those threatened.

''We had interviewed priests who were eyewitnesses to the massacre of innocent civilians in Mbandaka,'' he said today. ''The reason the Government was always trying to keep us away from Mbandaka is that most of the other incidents occurred far away, out in the middle of the jungle. The only witnesses were the refugees themselves, who then scattered to the four winds.

''In Mbandaka you had Rwandese and Congolese troops massacring people in front of the populace. There are hundreds of potential eyewitnesses.''

The investigation was ill-fated from its inception more than a year ago, when the United Nations Human Rights Commission asked its special monitor for what was then Zaire, Roberto Garreton of Chile, to look into charges that massacres had taken place during Mr. Kabila's military advance late in 1996 on the Government of Mobutu Sese Seko.
