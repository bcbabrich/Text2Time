''We have one of the best teams in the nation and some of the best players in the nation coming together to play the best women's basketball,'' said Ryan Welsh, a 20-year-old sophomore, while sitting in front of a G-ville tent. ''I think that this has always been a men's basketball school. But in general, the Duke students have been excited about every kind of sport. This year the women's team has gotten a little more of a following.''

Goestenkors has labored for years to build the women's program to the level of the men's, and her Blue Devils are on the verge of becoming a national power alongside Connecticut and Tennessee. She called the sellout ''a long time coming for this arena.''

The players hope a victory, and a national title this season, will keep the fans coming.

''Every year you see the fan support increase, slowly but surely,'' the junior forward Iciss Tillis said. ''It takes time. We haven't won a national championship yet. Something like that really will help fans come in. We just feel like if the students come and watch us play, they'll find us just as exciting as the guys.''

This game is not lacking for drama. Aside from the matchup of undefeated teams, there is the possibility of an individual battle that may help determine whether Alana Beard, Duke's guard/forward, or Diana Taurasi, UConn's guard, is voted the national player of the year.

Beyond that, Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma has stirred the Cameron Crazies into a froth. Auriemma has been taking shots at Duke for months, his latest biting comments coming in a conference call with reporters on Thursday.
