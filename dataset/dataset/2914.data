An off-duty narcotics detective was fatally stabbed yesterday morning as he tried to break up an argument between his girlfriend and her former boyfriend, the authorities said.

Police officials declined to release the name of the detective, saying that to do so would compromise the undercover investigation on which he was working.

They said the confrontation began shortly before 8:20 a.m., when Luis Alberto Gomez Gonzalez, a 26-year-old auto mechanic, knocked on the door of a fifth-floor apartment at 1355 Grand Concourse, where his former girlfriend lives with their 6-year-old daughter.

The child was not at home when her mother answered the door, the police said. The woman and Mr. Gonzalez began arguing, they said, and the detective, who had returned to the apartment with his girlfriend a few hours earlier, went to the door to intervene. Mr. Gonzalez stabbed him once in the chest with a knife, the police said.
