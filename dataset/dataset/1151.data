As the 2102 Olympics draw near, the coverage of the Games seems to become more intense and interesting by the day. The 2012 London Olympics blog will regularly showcase notable articles on the Web, from British newspapers to sport- and team-specific sites:

Brian Cazeneuve at Sports Illustrated focuses on nine storylines to keep up with before and during the Games, including the question of how fast Usain Bolt will run in London.

The Guardian’s Olympics blog is a collection of engaging news and notes, including its report that Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi of Malaysia will compete in the air rifle — and will be eight months pregnant at the time (also noted: no British beer will be sold at the Games).

The Daily Mail catches up with the seven athletes it selected seven years ago to follow as they prepared for the London Games.

At USA Volleyball, Sinjin Smith looks at beach volleyball in London and beyond.

And the latest on what’s going on with the summer’s U.S. Olympic and Paralympic archery teams.
