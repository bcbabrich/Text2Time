The Navy, warned of a problem with suspect jet engine blades, has grounded 90 of its 300 A-7E attack jets for inspection and possible replacement of their engines, a Navy spokesman said today. The spokesman said at least two crashes this year had been linked to the possible defect. The engines are made by the Allison Gas Turbine Division of the General Motors Corporation.
