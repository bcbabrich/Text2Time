With Blue Cross plans all over the country in financial trouble, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey is fighting to regain the financial health it enjoyed until the 1980's, when changes in the state's system of paying for health care, combined with an explosion in expensive medical technology, threatened to bankrupt the insurer.

New Jersey Blue Cross officials said they are concentrating on new strategies. They said they are devising programs to steer their policyholders to hospitals offering the best rates as well as the best care, and they said they also will campaign to force commercial insurance companies to help underwrite the cost of insuring people with the poorest health.

The nonprofit corporation, which until 1980 was given a 30 percent discount by hospitals because of its quasi-public role as the insurer of last resort, lost most of its competitive edge in the last decade and has been accused by public health advocates of trying to abandon its commitment to insure all comers.

The financial problems plaguing New Jersey Blue Cross may exemplify the difficulties facing other plans. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, is looking into the financial strength of the nation's 73 Blue Cross companies. Mr. Nunn estimates that 20 percent of the insurance companies have financial problems.
