TELEVISION in the next century will surely be about choice. No matter what form the television set itself takes, the number of programs it delivers will be virtually limitless with the notion of separate, distinct channels all but extinct. Instead, every home will have the ME channel -- really a series of channels, one for each member of the family, offering a completely individualized lineup of programs assembled from the all-but-infinite selections pulsing through the digital web.

Thus television, the most effective mass medium ever devised, will be undermined as a vehicle of mass distribution -- and with it will go the hit show. Why? Because the same digital forces will also affect magazines, newspapers and radio, causing them to narrow their focus -- and making it almost impossible for producers to establish a new show among a wide variety of viewers at the same time. There will be no reason to broadcast a show at a given hour (except for live events like sports), so the possibilities for creating a nationally popular entertainment program will be drastically limited.

With few bona fide hits, advertising revenues will most likely shrink. That will mean a switch to an almost entirely pay-per-view system for the ME channels, just like at a movie theater.

Programmers will try to counter with interactive communications, made possible by the merging of the television and the computer, to create instant word of mouth about new shows.
