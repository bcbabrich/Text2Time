The Federal program aimed at improving basic academic skills of low-income children, known as Chapter 1, needs major revision. Over the years, its funds have been spread too thin and fail to help many of the neediest students.

The Clinton Administration has put forth a sensible plan to concentrate more money on the most disadvantaged students. As Congress begins marking up the bill this week, it should follow the Administration's lead -- and go even further.

Since 1965 the program has provided remedial instruction in reading, language and math to low-income students. It currently covers more than five million students in two-thirds of the nation's schools. But in the last year, three separate studies have suggested changes to improve the program's success.

Typically, students are pulled out of regular classes to attend remedial classes for 30 minutes. Too often, they then fall behind in their regular classes. The reports recommended fewer remedial classes and more emphasis in regular classes on critical thinking and analytical skills. They also suggested improvements in teacher training, student evaluations and health and social services for needy students.
