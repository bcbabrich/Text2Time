The United States, which has portrayed Iran as the main aggressor in the Persian Gulf war, has strongly protested Iraq's renewed attacks on Iranian targets, State Department officials said today.

But Iraq's Ambassador to the United States, Nizar Hamdoon, said that despite the American protest, Iraq would continue its attacks on Iranian offshore oil installations and ships carrying Iranian oil in the gulf.

''Iraq never promised anybody we were going to stay idle for a specific time,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We share the Americans' concern, but we have the right to decide our own policy.'' Iran Attacks Kuwaiti Ship
