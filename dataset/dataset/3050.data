The questions hung heavily in the air and then seemed to fill the room.

Daniel R. Coats, the former Republican senator from Indiana, had been summoned to a suite at the Madison Hotel near the White House by President-elect George W. Bush and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney for an audition of sorts for the job of secretary of defense, advisers to the participants recalled.

And in the midst of their 45-minute conversation, on Dec. 18, the two auditioners began to ask themselves whether Mr. Coats was up to the job of running the world's largest corporation, or whether there was a stature gap.

Could a former lawmaker who had been a top aide to Dan Quayle when he was a congressman go mano a mano with Colin L. Powell, a four-star general who had served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had run the war that ousted Iraq from Kuwait, had flirted with running for president and was now poised to become secretary of state?

Or would he turn out to be Aspin redux, a figure like the Clinton administration's first defense secretary, Representative Les Aspin, who was well liked and respected as a brilliant mind on defense matters but who was widely viewed by White House and Pentagon officials at the end of his tenure as an indecisive and ineffective manager who lost President Clinton's confidence and had to resign?
