That's when he reached into his mental file, and pulled out a winning shot.

"That restart, to myself, it made me think of my first 500-mile victory," Fittipaldi said. "It was in Michigan in 1985, when there was one lap to go and they put on the green, and I had Al Unser Sr. right on my gearbox."

He used the same technique Sunday that he used then, and it worked just as well.

"When I approached Turn 3, I left a big gap to the pace car," he said. "I slowed down to second gear, more than normally you should do. And when I looked in the mirror, I saw Arie and Nigel leaving a gap, waiting to jump on the start.

"And then I slowed down even more, to build that gap. And when I saw that happen, I put the power down." The Right Tires

That left Luyendyk and Mansell eating dust in the drag race to the final green flag.

Fittipaldi's car was ready for all this because of time spent on the driving range -- in this case, the second week of practice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. "He worked all week that second week picking his race tires," Penske explained.

After getting into the lineup on the first weekend of qualifying, Fittipaldi and his teammate, Paul Tracy of Canada, spent the next few days picking the eight sets of tires and air-pressure settings that made their cars handle best. And they restricted their practice to the same midday hours when the race would be run, so their cars would be set up for the weather during the race.

At least two other drivers, Andretti and Al Unser Jr., were knocked out of contention Sunday by poor tire selection.

Preparation can't replace experience, as the 24-year-old Tracy demonstrated on lap 95 when he tried too hard to pass Scott Brayton in Turn 3. Brayton moved down on Tracy, and Brayton's rear wheels clipped the nose of Tracy's car, which slid into the wall.
