The Trump administration is considered the wealthiest in United States history. Here is a look at the value of assets held by some top officials at the time they joined the administration, based on financial disclosure filings. People highlighted in yellow are members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet.

Because the value of each asset is reported as a range, like “$100,001 - $250,000,” as opposed to a precise amount, we are showing the total value of assets as bottom and top estimates. People who had at least one asset classified as “over $50,000,000” are shaded in green, indicating that their total assets could actually be worth much more than this number.
