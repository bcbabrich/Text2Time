CHICAGO – When Dewayne Wise leaped into history on July 23, with a spectacular catch to save Mark Buehrle’s perfect game, he did it in front of a mural of Billy Pierce, the former White Sox left-hander.

When I interviewed Wise for this feature story, I mentioned that Pierce once had a perfect game broken up with two out in the ninth inning. Wise was floored.

“Really?” he cried. “You serious? Two outs in the ninth? Wow.”

Pierce’s oddity, in fact, is more unusual than a perfect game. It was one of only nine occasions that a pitcher has lost a perfecto with two out in the ninth. The last, you’ll remember, was the Yankees’ Mike Mussina in 2001. There have been 18 perfect games.

Buehrle needed Wise to make one of the greatest catches ever — given the degree of difficulty and the circumstances — to secure his gem. I asked Wise, 31, for his favorite defense plays of all-time, besides his own, and he named three.

First was Ken Griffey Jr.’s running, airborne catch at the wall in Seattle in 1995, when Griffey broke his wrist robbing Kevin Bass of extra bases. He also mentioned a two-handed, over-the-shoulder catch by Andruw Jones that I couldn’t precisely place.

“And I like that Ozzie Smith play at shortstop, bare-hand, where it hits the rock or whatever,” Wise said, referring to an extraordinary grab from Smith’s 10th game in the majors, on April 20, 1978. “That was unbelievable to me, to be able to lay out, the ball takes a funny hop and you’re able to stick your hand up and catch it? That takes a lot of talent, man.”

It is Griffey who was Wise’s idol as a boy in South Carolina. He wore his hat backward because Griffey did, and was thrilled to be his teammate late last season in Chicago and before that in Cincinnati. One spring training, Wise said, Griffey invited him to dinner on his yacht.

“I’d just sit back and watch everything he does and say, ‘God, this is the guy I grew up idolizing and now I’m sitting beside him, playing with him,’ ” Wise said. “Man, it’s unbelievable.”

Now Wise has his own version of the unbelievable, a play for the ages. And the mural of Pierce now has two words stenciled above it: THE CATCH.
