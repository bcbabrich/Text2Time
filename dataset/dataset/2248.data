Postgame: So, it’s an all-European final four. France thoroughly deserved this. The team controlled the play throughout, and Brazil never found a way to free up Ronaldinho, who was double-teamed all night and ended up a folorn figure on the left flank. Serves ’em right for playing 4-5-1. After the first 10 minutes, Brazil sat back and waited for the counter. In doing so, they allowed Zidane to control the midfield, which — even though he’s 34 and as we’ve heard ad nauseum about to retire — is still a bad idea. But it took a moment of genius and a beautiful goal to decide this game. It was also a terrific team performance by the French, with every single player playing at the peak of their powers.

That’s it from me. Someone will take time out from the July 4 barbecue to bring you Italy-Germany, and Victor Mather will take you through France-Portugal on Wednesday.

90+3 Peeeeeeeepppeeeeep!! That’s it! Brazil goes home; France heads into the semis. Cut to crying Brazil fans. The French celebrate.

90+3 Zidane picks up a loose ball and slowly dribbles into the Brazil half. Time for one last Brazil attack. The ball flies in to the French box … and Barthez gathers.

There will be three minutes of stoppage time now.

90+1 Gallas saves Barthez’s hide as he clears a Ronaldo shot that the keeper fans.

90 Brazil begins another patient build up before Roberto Carlos hoofs it upfield. France counters through Zidane who passed to Saha. he shoots at Dida.

89 Biggest play of the night and Ronaldinho’s free kick whistles just over the bar.

88 Yellow card France: Thuram.

88 Danger for France here. Ronaldo fouled by Thuram at the edge of the area. Ronaldo sells this one beautifully.

Yellow card France: Saha. Keeps on running after the flag goes up for offside.

86 Adriano wins a corner off Sagnol. Barthez races out to palm it clear. And the whistle sounds for a foul.

85 Substitution France: Henry off, Saha on. That’s it for the subs, those of you playing along at home.

83 Ronaldo gets a shot off from 20 yards, but the ball heads wide.

82 Henry shoves Cicinho for a free kick on the right. Brazil now begin an attack from their own half. Robinho gets fouled on the right. The ball is decisively cleared by Sagnol at the back.

81 Substitution France: Malouda off, Wiltord on.

80 Malouda fouls Cicinho on the right. No card, but Brazil is pushing forward in numbers. Robinho gets a half chance and puts it wide.

78 Substitution Brazil: Kaka off, Robinho on. Here comes the kitchen sink.

76 Substitution France: Ribery off, Govou on. Nothing left in the tank for the French midfielder. A great performance. Govou will be required to hold the ball upfield.

76 Substitution Brazil: Cafu off, Cicinho on. The captain’s armband goes to Dida.

75 Yellow card Brazil: Rotten foul by Lucio on Henry on the right flank.

74 Yellow card France: Sagnol fouls Kaka. Actually, Kaka sold him that.

72 Beautiful spin move by Zidane. Evidently, he’s not dead yet.

72 Henry shoots at Dida after Vieira and Sagnol mug Ronaldinho on the right.

71 Break by Henry, who goes one on one with Lucio, and then plays a great ball to Ribery but Dida races off his line to anticipate and block the shot.

70 Brazil switches to a 4-4-2, but it’s a bit desperate now. The team is pushing forward, which means Ribery and Zidane are having fun on the break.

68 Zidane, encircled by defenders, finds Sagnol who wins a corner. The ball is cleared and Adriano counters. Much huffing and puffing ensues and the ball eventually goes out for a goal kick.

66 Ronaldo stripped by Malouda at the edge of the French area who sets Zidane clear.

65 Ribery breaks through, and turns Roberto Carlos inside out, but the Brazil defender saves the day with a desperate lunge at the edge of the area. Roberto Carlos has a bruised gluteus maximus.

64 Substitution Brazil: Juninho off, Adriano on.

Hey, stop crying, old Brazil fan on the TV. The selecao looks a little lost at the moment, but it only takes one effort. And France does have a comedy keeper.

61 Sooooooooo close. Ribery robs Lucio, breaks clear in the box, sends a ball across the goal that Juan nearly puts into his own net.

57 GOOOOOOOOOOOAAAALLL: Brazil 0-1 France. Thierrrrrry Henry!!!!!!! Zidane sends in a free kick wide on the left. The ball flies over the defense and Thierry Henry, unmarked and alone at the far post, roofs it with a leaping volley. That was coming, and no more than they deserve. Yeah, he’s a big-game bottler, all right.

54 Thuram strips Kaka deep in the French half. Nothing is going right for Brazil at the moment. Zidane plays a wonderful sombrero over Ronaldo.

53 Malouda has a free kick on the right. The ball finds Henry, who puts it into the net, but it’s offside. I’m beginning to forget what a goal looks like.

52 Close there. Sagnol crosses to Henry in the box. The Arsenal man backheels for Vieira, but his shot is blocked and the ball goes out for a corner.

51 Dida plunks in an up and under in the vain hope of finding Ronaldo. He’s so isolated, and Brazil is so bogged down, they’re hoofing it like Norway. Or England.

49 Henry breaks down the left flank and crosses low into the box, but the ball is cleared.

48 Oops. Barthez screws up and flubs Ze Roberto’s cross. This is better from Brazil.

47 Ronaldinho, double-teamed, wins a corner that Thuram clears.

46 We’re back and Zidane starts things off with a fine free kick into the box. Vieira cuts in ahead of Henry and heads wide.

Halftime: Brazil 0-0 France. Well, Brazil survives a very poor half, but only just. The TV crews have made endless references to Zidane’s age, but he looks like a spring chicken compared to Cafu and Roberto Carlos. Meanwhile Ronaldinho just hasn’t had much of the ball; the French have figured out that Brazil flows through him, and they’ve done a great job squeezing him out, and chasing down every 50-50 ball in midfield. Parreira has a lot of homework to do during the break. And as for Domenech, his players will be reminding him that if it ain’t broke …

45+1 Ball advances another five yards. Every Brazilian bar one is in the wall. Zidane and Henry debate. Zidane fires it at the wall and the ball pings around the box for a bit before Vieira’s final shot is blocked and the whistle goes for halftime.

45 Yellow card Brazil: Ronaldo for handball.

45 Free kick France 24 yards out. Henry fires at the wall. The ball catches Ronaldo’s hand.

Yellow card Brazil: Late challenge by Juan brings down Viera from behind, after Zidane had set Vieira off on one of those surging runs. Juan is lucky to stay on here. Either way, he’s out of the next game.

41 Kaka now, coughs it up to Zidane and the French head forward again. The final ball has been consistently lacking, but Malouda and Abidal are causing Cafu all kinds of problems.

41 Abidal finds Malouda on the left, but the ball is cleared in the box by Cafu, who wellies it for a throw-in.

39 Zidane backs into Cafu and concedes a free kick. A rarity: Brazil has possession. It ends with Cafu hitting a hopeful ball toward the far post, while Ronaldinho stands a yard to his left, screaming for the ball.

38 Long useless clearance by Roberto Carlos. Brazil’s defenders are struggling and Cafu fouls Malouda. Hey, there’s our favorite Red Bull, Youri Djorkaeff. He’s here for the game, but away from his MLS team for personal reasons. Here’s a hint: he’s at the game.

35 Vieira getting more involved now, which is freeing up both Makelele and Zidane. Vieira now strips Ronaldinho and plays another ball forward.

33 Ribery goes one on one with Roberto Carlos. The Brazilian wins the throw, but Ribery looks like he’s giving him trouble.

32 Nasty block by Gilberto Silva on Ribery. Where are the Brazilians? Free kick cleared by Juan in the goalmouth.

31 Good possession by France and they win another corner. Malouda’s corner is punched out by Dida.

29 Ronaldo gets a rare break, but his shot is snuffed out by Thuram.

29 Another troubling corner for Brazil. It’s cleared to Ronaldinho, who’s upended by Makelele.

28 Zidane is running the show deep on the left. Abidal finds Malouda, whose cross from the left is sent behind by Roberto Carlos’ head.

25 Lucio fouls Henry 35 yards out on the left. Zidane sends a looping ball over the goal. Bit of a waste that.

24 Yellow card Brazil: Cafu, for getting stripped by Abidal and then tugging the Frenchman’s shirt.

24 Odd to see Brazil relying on the counter. France is looking very assured at the moment, passing the ball confidently around. Ronaldo’s getting a workout, though, which should relieve his sizeist critics.

21 Lucio wins a duel with Henry but concedes a corner. More legs go flying and the ball is cleared by Brazil. Cafu plays a stinker of a ball to Ronaldo.

20 Kaka tries to lay one on for Ronaldo, but you can guess what happens.

19 Did you know this could be Zidane’s last match? This is JP Dellacamera’s mantra for the second straight game. I’m back on HD now, which is the only thing that makes it bearable viewing. That, and Shelli Smith’s 3D scary coming atcha hands.

18 Ronaldinho tries another one to Ronaldo, who puffs after the ball but Barthez smothers.

16 Vieira — nice of him to join us — and gets thumped in the back by Juan for a free kick. Sagnol runs down the right and shoots at Dida who bounces it down and then catches it.

15 Ronaldinho, who has a free role as provider, tries a pass to Junhinho, but it’s a little too far. Another one to Kaka goes behind for a goal kick.

14 France pushing hard as bodies go flying in the box. The ball goes behind for a France corner. Zidane takes it ,and Dida punches the ball out to Ribery who volleys over.

12 Makelele crosses to Henry, who turns and shoots. It’s a tame effort and the ball is cleared.

11 Henry shoots from 30 yards. The ball is smacked off Lucio’s head and goes behind. Lucio takes it hard and stays down, and is escorted off the field.

10 Brazil has started the brighter of the two, and Kaka wins a free kcik about 30 yards out on the right . Ronaldinho tees up, and sends it toward the far post, where Ronaldo heads over.

9 Sagnol concedes a corner (actually it comes off Roberto Carlos, but the ref doesn’t care). It’s a short one — why do they bother with short ones, they never work — and Roberto Carlos sends it sailing into the stands.

7 A lot of feeling out at the moment. Zidane is being shadowed by Gilberto Silva, who, I believe, had the same job for Arsenal against Real Madrid.

5 Zidane fouls Kaka in a similar spot. Juninho takes it again and plays it to Juan, who’s about 10 yards offside.

runs

4 Juninho takes the kick and it clips the wall and runs off for a corner. Barthez punches the corner clear.

3 Ronaldinho is double-teamed by Ribery and Gallas. A dangerous free kick beckons just outside the area. Roberto Carlos wants it.

2 Juninho tries to feed Cafu but the ball on the right is too far.

1 We’re off. France in white playing right to left; Brazil in yellow. Zidane starts with a nifty piece of skill, juking past a trio of defenders but the ball to Henry is a poor one.

A couple of hearty national anthems, and Setanta and the host German feed point out Jacques Chirac. The two ageing galacticos, Ronaldo and Zidane hug it out and then all players pose behind an anti-racism banner.

Pregame:Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz! Well, that was a real thriller wasn’t it? Like sitting through a grade school talent show, or a support act that just. wouldn’t. leave. So, bye-bye England, sent packing by Cristiano Ronaldo, the human equivalent of World Cup mascot Goleo (long neck, won’t give the ball up, and deeply unpopular). Anyone else catch the pub footage on ABC? I was sort of hoping for an England win just to see the mad fan in the front’s head explode. But never mind, there’s always another shootout to lose around the corner.

So having gone 1-2 on my quarterfinal predictions, and losing my 8-1 shots, Argentina, at the bookies (hey, at least they knew how to make a dignified exit), the world can now turn its attention to France-Brazil, a real clash. Is France Brazil’s bogey team? Do the geriatrics of les bleus have one more trick up their sleeves before Zizou rides off into the sunset, Lucky Luke-style? Or will Brazil wake up and play the French off the park? So, France it is then. There, if that isn’t a 3-0 win for Brazil, I don’t know what is.

Having taught the young pups of Spain a thing or two (ie matches are played over 90 minutes), France takes the field with an unchanged lineup. Zidane, Patrick Vieira and Frank Ribery are all on yellow cards.

Brazil brings Gilberto Silva into the midfield in place of Emerson, and there is no place for Adriano in the lineup. In comes long-range specialist and deadball expert Juninho Pernambucano. Does that mean portly striker Ronaldo has to play up front alone? Will we see two 4-5-1s today? Or will Ronaldinho be given a role in the hole? Either way, Juan is on a yellow.

In case you’ve stumbled in here by accident, this is a rematch of the 1998 World Cup Final, and the 1986 World Cup quarterfinal, both of which were won by France. In fact, you have to go back to 1958 for Brazil’s lone success against the French, a 5-2 win in the semifinals, back when a certain Pele made his World Cup debut.
