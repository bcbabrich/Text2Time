In the brutal business of magazine publishing, the most successful recent entries have been shopping guides from powerhouses like Cond√© Nast Publications.

Then there is Legal Affairs, a two-year-old magazine of law and ideas that was born and nurtured at Yale Law School. Even though the magazine has no claim to financial success, Legal Affair's staff has decided to shed its Yale ties and go it alone.

The January/February issue will be the first to appear without the label, "A magazine of Yale Law School." Yale's money probably will not end, but it is expected to flow more slowly and perhaps less predictably.

"The idea was there would be a period of a couple years when the magazine would operate under the protective umbrella of the institution," said Seth P. Waxman, a former solicitor general of the United States and a faculty member at the Georgetown University Law Center, who was recently elected chairman of the magazine's board.
