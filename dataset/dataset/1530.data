The former head of the American International Group unit that nearly crippled the insurer said the 2008 taxpayer bailout of up to $182 billion was too generous to customers like Goldman Sachs, Reuters reports.

Goldman Sachs, in turn, insisted it simply followed its agreement with A.I.G. and underlying accounting rules in demanding collateral under the credit default insurance products it bought from A.I.G.

“I think I would have negotiated a much better deal for the taxpayer than what the taxpayer got,” a defiant yet calm Joseph Cassano told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission on Wednesday.

Mr. Cassano, the ex-chief of A.I.G.’s Financial Products Division who was edged out roughly seven months before the September 2008 bailout, says he could have saved taxpayers money if he had been allowed to negotiate claims with firms like Goldman.

Instead, flush with cash after the bailout, A.I.G. moved to settle claims at full value.

Goldman’s president, Gary Cohn, offered no apology for the collateral calls and said considerable shareholder money was spent ahead of the bailout to insure against the risk that A.I.G. would never pay.

“If you look at our trading agreement with A.I.G., it very clearly states our marks were to be determined at fair (market) value,” Mr. Cohn said.

The commission is holding two days of hearings into the role of derivatives in the financial crisis. Thursday’s session will include further A.I.G. and Goldman witnesses along with current and former regulators.

Wednesday’s hearing provided Mr. Cassano, against whom federal inquiries were recently dropped, with an opportunity to defend himself publicly. It also allowed Goldman a forum to again reject criticism that it bet against clients and received a backdoor bailout as part of the government’s rescue of A.I.G.

The 10-member commission, headed by the former California state treasurer, Phil Angelides, is scheduled to issue a report by Dec. 15 detailing the causes of financial crisis.

“I’m not looking for a whodunnit, but who built this bomb?” Mr. Angelides asked during Wednesday’s hearing.
