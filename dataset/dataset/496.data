7. Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso One Réédition

The Reverso has long given watch buyers an entry to Jaeger-LeCoultre’s diverse collection of in-house-produced watches, with dozens of steel versions of the Art Deco-themed piece with time-only displays offered over the years. But the tiny Reverso One Réédition, sized for women’s wrists, at just 16.3 millimeters wide, uses a quartz movement rather than one of Jaeger’s in-house mechanical calibers to bring the price down to less than $5,000. Not that quartz Reversos are new, but it is telling that the brand has placed a battery-powered watch at the center of its 2016 activities (and forgoing high-end complicated Reversos altogether), particularly given its successful focus on ladies’ mechanicals over the last five years. jaeger-lecoultre.com
