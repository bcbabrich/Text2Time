That was a short offseason in college football. Penn State, which won the top ranking in last season's final college football polls, has lost the first coin toss of the 1983 season.

At a meeting of the commissioners of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority yesterday, Nebraska won the right to wear its home red jerseys for the game against the Nittany Lions at Giants Stadium on Aug.29 in the first annual Kickoff Classic. The National Collegiate Athletic Association has approved the classic as the official season opener.
