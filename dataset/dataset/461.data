The York Theater Company has tried an experiment with its production of “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown,” casting this musical about young children with relatively young children, ones who have Broadway or regional houses or both on their résumés. The experiment proves two things:

1. This is a more demanding musical than you might remember.

2. Big-stage experience doesn’t necessarily guarantee small-stage success.

The show, of course, features the “Peanuts” gang singing and philosophizing through vignettes from little-kid existence: a nail-biting baseball game, a daunting book report, anxiety over a favorite blanket. The focus, naturally, is Charlie Brown, played by Joshua Colley, who has appeared in the Broadway productions of “Newsies” and “Les Misérables.” (Graydon Peter Yosowitz steps into the role June 1 through 7.)

In a performance last week, Mr. Colley still had work to do to capture the angst of Charlie Brown. With the exception of Milly Shapiro, who is a spot-on delight as Sally, all of the actors (who are ages 9 through 13) seemed to need a lot more directing from Michael Unger, whose task here is formidable.
