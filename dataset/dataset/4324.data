The Bankers Trust Building, which takes up the block from 48th to 49th Street on Park Avenue, is no longer that in name only. In a complicated transaction, the bank is buying the part of its headquarters building that it does not already own. The deal should close by late fall.

The bank is exercising an option to buy the property according to a formula based on its fair market value as of Jan 1, 1993. The bank and the owner of the property, Sigmund Sommer Properties, could not agree on an appraisal of the building.

On Friday, an arbitration board set the value at $135.4 million. The bank will pay an undisclosed fraction of that amount.

The bank's appraisers, Cushman & Wakefield, had valued the property at $90 million; James Felt Appraising, the Sommer appraiser, put the worth at $180 million. First Rights of Refusal
