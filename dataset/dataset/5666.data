The Federal authorities have subpoenaed the guest list for a party held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Dec. 15, the night a painting was believed to have been stolen.

The art work was last seen by a security guard at 7 P.M. on Dec. 15, propped against a wall in a gallery used for storage.

At that time, 120 people, including the Mayor of Philadelphia, W. Wilson Goode, and some of the city's best- known black judges, doctors, lawyers and businessmen, were attending a formal cocktail party in the museum's Great Hall.

The men's room used by guests is between the Great Hall and the gallery where the painting was stored.
