Bernard H. Siegan, a conservative legal scholar whose unsuccessful nomination to a federal appellate judgeship was one of the most bitterly disputed judicial nominations of the Reagan era, died on Monday in Encinitas, Calif. He was 81 and lived in San Diego.

The cause was complications of a stroke he had last year, his wife, Shelley, said.

At his death, Professor Siegan was a distinguished professor of law at the University of San Diego, where he had taught for more than 30 years.

In early 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated Professor Siegan to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which comprises nine Western states, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. In July 1988, after nearly a year and a half in which Professor Siegan was publicly denounced by liberals and also by some conservatives, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his nomination.

Professor Siegan was best known for his ardent libertarian views on economic matters, and on property rights in particular. In his many books and articles, he maintained that the Constitution protected what he called the "economic liberties" of individuals. The courts, he argued, should return to their pre-New Deal stance of enforcing such liberties.

Though Professor Siegan had his defenders, some conservatives considered his views extreme, seeing him as a "judicial activist" who thought the courts should invalidate much of the economic and social legislation of the modern era.

Judge Robert H. Bork, whose nomination to the Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in 1987, had cautioned in a 1985 speech that Professor Siegan's economic ideas could engender "a massive shift away from democracy and toward judicial rule."
