Two Palestinians were killed today as Israeli troops and a Jewish settler opened fire on stone-throwing youths in Hebron, in the West Bank, Palestinians said.

An army spokesman said the circumstances of the kilings were unclear. ''There are five wounded and we are speaking of one or two killed,'' the spokesman said, adding that the army was investigating the shootings.

Eight Palestinians have been killed in the last week by Israeli soldiers using live ammunition and plastic bullets to quash unrest in the occupied territories. Early this week, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the plastic bullets were nonlethal and were meant to injure, not to kill. He said he hoped that an increase in injuries would discourage Palestinian protests.

But there was a surge in the number of deaths this week, when the plastic bullets were first put into use, and the United States has protested. Palestinians say at least 100 people have been wounded by the plastic ammunition.
