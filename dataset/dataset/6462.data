ROME, Oct. 31—City Hall is subjecting the entire medical profession to a check‐up in the wake of a survey indicating that only three out of every 10 Roman doctors were paying “reasonable taxes.”

The survey showed 30 per cent of physicians in the sample group were not paying any any municipal taxes at all, and the remainder were found to have been assessed far below their actual earnings.

Hard‐pressed for new revenue the city, which is deeply in debt, is also scrutinizing dress makers, interior decorators, architects, hairdressers and what are delicately described as “freelancers of love.”

Rome's city fathers are awakening to the fact that in this city of bureaucrats, hotels and pleasant living, people in service jobs often make much more than they care to tell the tax inspector.
