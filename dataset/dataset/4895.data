''The United States,'' he said, ''must launch a genuine plan for the Andes, not just a laundry list of disjointed initiatives.''

The Administration's response is that the problem of cocaine smuggling from Latin America has been building since the early 1970's, and that it will take time to solve. ''We can show some little successes, but over all it's going to take several years,'' said a United States official in Peru. ''We're just getting into the ballgame, just starting to get the resources we need.''

Some Administration officials working on drug issues in Washington say they do not expect to see any measurable effect on the flow of cocaine into the United States until late 1990. ''That's just a realistic assessment of how long it takes government to work,'' one said.

Some Bush aides acknowledged that the Panama invasion has not been a plus for the drug war, and one said it was ''catastrophically negative'' and indicated that Washington was holding out hope that Peru would ultimately decide to join in the Andean summit meeting now that it has resumed its anti-drug program with the United States. Colombia One Kingpin Down, But Many to Go One of the most notable successes in the drug fight came in mid-December, when Colombian security forces chased down and killed Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a powerful and violent leader of the Medellin cartel, which controls much of the world cocaine market. It was a major accomplishment for Colombia, and it bolstered public support after drug bosses had repeatedly escaped police raids and terrorized the capital, Bogota, with nightly bombings.

In the last two weeks drug terrorism has dropped significantly. And there is some evidence that drug-ring leaders are now fighting each other. But the American and Colombian authorities say Mr. Rodriguez Gacha's death will have little effect on the export of cocaine because someone will win the battle to succeed him and simply pick up the slack.

And Colombian traffickers, who control most of the cocaine industry worldwide, are moving their jungle factories, where paste from the the coca leaf is processed into powder. The refineries are being set up in Peru and Bolivia and even along the frontiers of Brazil and Ecuador, which until now had been relatively free of drug traffic.

Scores of smaller Colombian drug processers and shippers and some of the major traffickers who have operated quietly and without violence have been left alone by the Government. Should the level of terrorism remain low for an extended period, some Colombian experts predict, the Government will declare victory and permit the peaceful drug traffickers to go about their business.
