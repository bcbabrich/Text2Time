WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 (Reuters)—The Department of Agriculture gave imported Australian beef a satisfactory rating today, attributing the salmonella outbreaks to domestic processing procedures. Some reports had said the infection came from imports.

“Incidents of salmonella here do not and should not reflect on imported beef.”said Dr. John Prucha of the department's Food Safety and Quality Service.
