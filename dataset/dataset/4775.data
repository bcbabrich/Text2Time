CARNEGIE HALL, 1960 At 17 I came to New York. The dormitory Was higher than most buildings I'd ever Been in. I ate in a coffee shop Where people never looked at you, Went on a tour of Bellevue Because it was a place, like Lindy's Or the Metropolitan Museum of Art, So legendary that being there was magic. Some New York kids I met said, "Let's go to Carnegie Hall." From Standing Room We looked down at the Philharmonic And their TV-star conductor, jumping Up and down on his podium, all creating Wonderful noise that filled the place And vibrated to the roots of my hair. The things you could take for granted in New York! -- LEWIS GARDNER

ON one of those frequent rainy April mornings, Rose E. Baker of Woodlawn, N.Y., is dashing to work wearing her nurse's whites. Glancing down the subway stairs she sees copper-colored water swirling at the bottom step. She hesitates for a moment or two considering whether to suffer wet feet all day or to retreat. Just then a man in high rubber boots approaches her.

"Do you want a lift?" he asks.

At first Ms. Baker does not quite understand his question. But then the fellow turns his back, bends over and says "Hop up!" She does and rides piggy-back all the way to the turnstile.

Delighted to have dry feet but embarrassed nevertheless, she thanks him profusely. He nods and moves on to the second flight of stairs. When Ms. Baker peers down she sees still more flood waters and her subway Sir Raleigh waiting on the bottom step.
