For Mr. Netanyahu, the negotiations on Hebron coincided with a critical Parliament vote on the 1997 budget. The Government is trying to trim the equivalent of $2 billion from the $58 billion budget, which must be passed by the end of the year.

$(The Parliament voted 60 to 42 to approve the budget on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. It includes both huge spending cuts and more funds for Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. It cuts $2.2 billion from existing programs, and allocates the equivalent of $9.5 billion for defense, $5.5 billion for education and $3 billion for health.

$(The A.P. said Finance Minister Dan Meridor told Israel Radio that $1.6 million was set aside for public buildings in the Golan Heights and an undisclosed amount for 300 new homes in Jewish settlements in the Golan, as well as $11 million for settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.$)

The reductions, to combat a large budget deficit, are regarded within Israel as a test of Mr. Netanyahu's mettle every bit as important as the Hebron negotiations. That means that he is facing the two most important tests of his young administration at the same time.

Both Hebron and the trimmed budget have roused stiff opposition within Mr. Netanyahu's Cabinet and his parliamentary coalition, though not always in the same combinations. Foreign Minister David Levy has supported Mr. Netanyahu on Hebron but is fighting him on the budget, while the hawkish Minister of Infrastructures, Ariel Sharon, has assailed Mr. Netanyahu over Hebron but is backing him on the budget.

To defuse the Hebron opposition, Mr. Netanyahu pledged to bring an agreement not only before his Cabinet but before the entire Parliament, promising more battles before the issue is finally resolved.

Seven of the 18 ministers in the Cabinet have said they will oppose the agreement, and two are wavering. Beyond that, Jewish settlers from Hebron and elsewhere in the West Bank are certain to mount a loud campaign of lobbying and demonstrating against the agreement.
