Corinne Ball is used to dealing with high-stakes situations.

In a recent interview with Investment Dealers’ Digest, Ms. Ball, who is the lead attorney advising Chrysler in its Chapter 11 case, recalled the beginning of her career as a bankruptcy lawyer in the 1970s. She was brought into a room where Abe Beame, the mayor of New York at the time, was signing a petition to put the city in Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.

“That was my first assignment, working on rescuing the city,” she told the publication. “How could you not resist working on the biggest rescue that anyone had seen at that point?”

New York never actually filed, of course. But Chrysler just did. And Ms. Ball, co-head of the restructuring and reorganization practice in Jones Day‘s New York office. is likely to draw upon her years of experience as she guides the automaker through its high-profile, and highly political, reorganization.

On Friday, Ms. Ball appeared in court for the first-day hearing in Chrysler’s case. (Zachery Kouwe of The New York Times wrote about the hearing here.)

Ms. Ball is no stranger to Chrysler: She was on the legal team back in the 1980s that helped save the Detroit automaker, which at the time was run by Lee Iacocca. Since then, she has worked on a number of major workouts and wind-downs, including the collapse of the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert in the early 1990s and, more recently, the restructuring of Dana, the auto parts supplier.

Ms. Ball spent the first 23 years of her career at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which is advising Lehman Brothers in its Chapter 11, the largest in United States history. She moved to Jones Day in 2001.

With all that expertise, Ms. Ball’s services don’t come cheap: Court filings show her billing rate is $900 an hour.
