The Who's 25th anniversary tour, which came to Giants Stadium on Thursday, might be called ''the Who cash in,'' as the reunited band reprises its songs for a summer's work projected to bring in about $30 million. Thursday's concert was mammoth in every way - in attendance (54,000, for the first of four nights), in the size of the band (15 members) and in length (more than three hours of music).

The crowd would probably have been pleased with a run-through of greatest hits. But in an unpredictable program that included hits, a sizable part of the rock opera ''Tommy'' and a selection of cover versions and material from band members' solo albums, the Who was both generous and almost vulnerable. The band revealed itself not just as earth-shaking stadium-rockers - though there are few experiences in rock to compare with hearing ''Won't Get Fooled Again'' as tens of thousands of arms wave and voices sing along - but as eccentric, even playful rock elder statesmen, jumping around the stage.

The original Who members - the singer Roger Daltrey, the guitarist-songwriter Pete Townshend and the bassist John Entwistle - played ''Magic Bus'' and ''Mary-Anne With the Shaky Hands'' on their own. Otherwise, the sound was filled out by Simon Phillips on drums (replacing the late Keith Moon) and auxiliary guitar, keyboards, percussion, horns and singers, not all of whom were strictly necessary.

The band members' solo features implied, perhaps misleadingly, each one's contributions to the Who - Mr. Entwistle's brute-force rock, Mr. Townshend's earnest pop and Mr. Daltrey's fondness for the blues. But choices outside the Who's catalogue were often embarrassing; instead of others' material, the Who might have revived songs that aren't on its greatest-hits albums. For its encore, the Who proudly declared itself a 1960's band with ''Barefootin','' ''Hey Joe'' and the Beatles' arrangement of ''Twist and Shout.''
