Just hours away from a bankruptcy-law filing, the Morrison Knudsen Corporation said yesterday that it had reached a preliminary agreement with its banks for financing to get it through most of 1995.

The big engineering company's banks agreed to provide $30 million in new loans and to extend the maturity on another $99 million in loans until late in the year, Robert S. Miller, the company's chairman, said.

The agreement must still be accepted by the company's more than two dozen lenders, and there are numerous details to be ironed out, but it has staved off a bankruptcy-law filing that Mr. Miller said Morrison Knudsen was already prepared to make yesterday because of its dire condition.

"I finally found the right thing to say: 'time's up,' " Mr. Miller said, alluding to the company's protracted negotiations with its banks. "And we finally did come up with an agreement. But it's fair to say the probable outcome if we had not done this was we'd have had to file" for bankruptcy protection.
