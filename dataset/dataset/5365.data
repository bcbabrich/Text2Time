Esquire, the monthly that has been one of the magazine industry's greatest turnaround stories in recent years, was bought yesterday by the Hearst Corporation as part of the sale and breakup of Esquire's parent company, the Esquire Magazine Group Inc.

As part of the overall transaction, the American Express Publishing Corporation bought the Esquire group's six-month-old publication, New York Woman. Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., acquired its Esquire Health and Fitness Clinic, which publishes a magazine-on-the-wall for health clubs. And the shareholders of the Esquire Magazine Group will continue to own the company's Esquire Press, its book publishing division, and Esquire Video.

Phillip Moffitt, editor in chief and president of the Esquire group, said financial terms of the deals would not be made public. He said he would become an editorial consultant to both Hearst and American Express Publishing for an interim period.

Rumors that Hearst would buy Esquire magazine had been circulating for several weeks. But it had not been apparent that Mr. Moffitt would almost completely relinquish his involvement in the communications empire that he and his erstwhile partner, Christopher Whittle, had carved out in the last 10 years.
