Sarajevo to Celebrate Sontag

Sarajevo will honor Susan Sontag by naming a street in her memory and placing a plaque on one of its theaters, The Associated Press reported. Sontag, the American critic and novelist who died on Tuesday at 71, made many visits to the city, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, when it was besieged during the conflict in Bosnia from 1992-95; she took part in staging a production of "Waiting for Godot" there in 1993. In a statement, the office of the city's mayor, Muhidin Hamamdzic, said, "The city of Sarajevo and its citizens express their sincere thanks to an author and a humanist who actively participated in the creation of the history of Sarajevo and Bosnia."

Filmmakers in Peril

Sometimes life imitates art; sometimes it comes hair-raisingly close. Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, right, the married filmmakers whose terrifying "Open Water," based on a real incident, dealt with a vacationing couple abandoned in shark-infested waters, narrowly escaped death themselves when the tsunami swept onto the resort island Phuket in Thailand on Sunday, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Kentis, 41, said he was returning to his hotel after running some morning errands when he saw the gigantic wave. "I heard people yelling, 'Run! Run!"' he said. "I looked behind me, and I thought, 'This is what happens in a movie when there's a tidal wave.' You could hear the rumbling, and this wave was coming right at us." Hurrying to his room on an upper floor, he found his sister-in-law and other relatives but not his wife and 7-year-old daughter, Sabrina. They were in a second-floor Internet cafe, trapped by a phone booth lodged in the stairwell, as the power failed and electric lines crackled around them. Ms. Lau, 41, said she escaped from the cafe balcony with Sabrina on her back after using a bamboo ladder to pull a half-dozen Swedish tourists to safety. The she and her husband, fearing another immense wave, hiked several miles into the mountains with their luggage. A few hours later, traveling by mini-cab, they reached Phuket's virtually unaffected east coast. "When we got there, it was all people on yachts having a good time," Mr. Kentis said. "It was just surreal."

Waiting for Paris

Guess who was late for her own party? Is the answer -- Paris Hilton, below -- a surprise? Scheduled to appear for the pink-ribbon cutting at the opening of her first nightclub, Club Paris, in Orlando, Fla., on Thursday, Ms. Hilton arrived six hours behind schedule, The Associated Press reported. She emerged from a stretch S.U.V. shortly after 1 a.m. yesterday to walk the pink carpet, while pink spotlights illuminated the night. "I was in the Swiss Alps, skiing, and I got caught at the airport with all the holiday travel," Ms. Hilton said with a smile, "so I've been trying to travel for the past 24 hours." Many of the guests, who included local officials and leading Orlando businessmen, had already left. "I'm so sorry I'm late," Ms. Hilton said. Her sister, Nicky Hilton, took her place at the ribbon cutting.
