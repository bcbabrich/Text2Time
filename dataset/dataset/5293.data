Most big bands are modeled on machines, with gleaming, interlocking parts meshed in efficient arrangements. The Gil Evans Orchestra, until the death of its leader this year, was something else - a hive, perhaps, or a commune. Instead of a blueprinted clarity, there's a fertile murk from which solos rise while colleagues toss in dissonances and the rhythm eddies below; arrangements seem to tumble together and later dissolve, like a jam session in which the horn players just happen to come up with fully harmonized ensembles.

In their tribute to Mr. Evans on Wednesday at the 92d Street Y's Kaufmann Concert Hall, 16 members of his orchestra played with the free-wheeling cooperation they'd brought to their Monday night residency at Sweet Basil. Now and then, Gil Goldstein at the piano or Lew Soloff or Miles Evans in the trumpet section might signal for a theme statement or a backing riff, but most of the time the orchestra rolled along in friendly, cluttered anarchy, closer to collective improvisation than to big-band rigidity. Band members might spitball dissonances into each others' solos, subtly shift rhythmic gears or just drop out as in dub reggae; it was music as a work in progress.

The set emphasized Mr. Evans's arrangements above his compositions. There were pieces by Jimi Hendrix (''Little Wing,'' with a torchy, volatile tenor-saxophone solo by George Adams, and ''Stone Free''), Charles Mingus (''Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,'' featuring John Clark on French horn and Chris Hunter on alto saxophone), Van Morrison (''Moondance,'' sung by the guitarist Hiram Bullock), and a medley of Charlie Parker and Bud Powell tunes, complete with a jagged be-bop solo line arranged for the whole band in unison. Rather than solos or fixed ensemble passages, what was important to the Evans orchestra was the territory in between, the implication that every composition is a Pandora's box of musical ideas waiting to be set free.

Courtney Pine, a 23-year-old British saxophonist, looks back to the turn of the 1960's, when John Coltrane was straining at the limits of be-bop harmony and about to break through to modal jazz. Mr. Pine has steeped himself in Coltrane's incantatory tenor-saxophone tone and his ''sheets of sound'' - cascading, hyperfast arpeggios - and modeled his quartet on the ones Coltrane led with Red Garland and Wynton Kelly on piano; on soprano saxophone, he sounds gentler and reedier than Coltrane, but his approach remains similar. He's not the first saxophonist to fall under Coltrane's sway, but his set Wednesday - which included Coltrane's ''Giant Steps'' - suggested he's one of the best.
