The personnel shake-up in the Soviet Communist Party yesterday was accompanied by a revamping of the party structure. Six Central Committee commissions were created, all headed by secretaries of the Central Committee, to supplant 22 departments as the party's main administrative apparatus. Political power continues to be centered in the Central Committee and the Politburo, where all important decisions are made. Communist Party Congress

Theoretically the highest body, the congress consists of delegates elected by party organizations around the country. It ordinarily convenes at least once every five years, with its next meeting scheduled in 1991. The Congress elects the Central Committee, which is to meet at least every six months. Central Committee

Consisting of about 300 voting and 150 nonvoting members, it is picked from among party congress delegates. It acts for the congress between sessions, meeting about twice a year to discuss and approve policies. It formally elects what is, in effect, the highest party body, the Politburo. Politburo

It sets the overall policy of the country and now has 12 full (voting) members and 8 candidate (nonvoting) members, all of whom are among the nation's leading political figures. All members have regular duties elsewhere in the party or Government. Secretariat
