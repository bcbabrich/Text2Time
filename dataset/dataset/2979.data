Flaws in the F.B.I.'s handling of the Zacarias Moussaoui case before Sept. 11 are prompting Congressional leaders and the Bush administration to try to make it easier for the government to obtain secret wiretaps and search warrants to investigate foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist plots.

At a Congressional hearing today, lawyers for the Justice Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency all expressed support for legislation in the Senate that would lower the standards of evidence required to obtain court approval for secret wiretaps in investigations of foreign terrorists and spies.

Under the rules in use last summer, F.B.I. officials did not believe they had enough evidence against Mr. Moussaoui before Sept. 11 to prove that he was an agent of a foreign power or had connections to an international terrorist group. He now faces trial in federal court, accused of being the 20th hijacker.

Under the legislation, sponsored by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, the Justice Department would no longer have to convince a special court that a suspect was an agent of a foreign power or a member of an international terrorist organization to obtain a wiretap under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
