WE always get these wonderful explanations from Olympic athletes about the various drugs found coursing around in their bodies. I can hardly wait for the explanation of the blood supplies left behind by the Austrian Nordic skiing team in a house in Utah.

Athletes and the officials who enable them are always so glib with their denials. For example, when Larisa Lazutina of Russia came up with a heightened level of red blood cells at the Winter Games, team officials said it was because she was menstruating. That excuse was not available for Johann Muehlegg, a German who brought dishonor to his new country, Spain. Anyway, they were both sent packing, along with another Russian, Olga Danilova.

The three disgraced athletes had better look in their trophy chests to see what happened to the three gold medals and three silvers they lugged out of Salt Lake City.

''They may think they have won gold medals,'' Richard Pound, the Olympic drug watchdog, pronounced the other day. ''But they are lead.''
