The Winter Classic just ended with a Sidney Crosby shootout goal. The game’s more thrilling moments involved stops in play when the ice doctors patted and sprayed problematic patches of ice. Would it hold out? As the snow fell more densely, stick handling involved more flakes than puck.

The atmosphere looked delightful, but the question began to form late in a tie game that had real meaning in the standings: Is this the way 2 points should be handed out?

An outdoor professional game is a great spectacle, a fun way to get casual fans back to the game. But perhaps it’s more suited to an All-Star game, or something meant to be all fun and games. Would we want to see the Indy 500 driven in an ice storm? Spurs and Pistons in the world’s largest schoolyard in the rain?

Actually, here’s what I’d like to see: Freeze the field at Yankee Stadium and let the Yanks and Sox have at it.
