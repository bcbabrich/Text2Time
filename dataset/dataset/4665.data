In its first action on spending for the coming fiscal year, the Suffolk County Legislature today let stand an $818,492 increase in the county's contribution to its community college.

Critics said the increase, the maximum allowed under a county law that caps rises in annual spending at 4 percent, would mean higher property taxes.

"Everyone knows if we walk out of here and do nothing, taxes will go up next year," said Sondra M. Bachety, a Democrat from North Babylon, before the votes.

The increase, requested by County Executive Robert J. Gaffney at the urging of officials of Suffolk County Community College, automatically took effect when legislators failed to adopt measures that would have frozen the county's share at its current level of $20.5 million.
