Newly armed with the entertainment and merchandising might of the Walt Disney Company, the ABC television network has, with one bold stroke, become the prototype of the television company of the future.

The combined assets of ABC and Disney will transform the network into the dominant programming power in television, so strong that Wall Street analysts said yesterday that ABC's rivals, NBC and CBS, may be forced into similar mergers just to compete with the new ABC juggernaut.

ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC, will be uniquely positioned to sell more programs internationally than any other production studio and to market and merchandise program-product tie-ins on a scale that will dwarf anything a broadcaster has ever previously attempted, executives from Disney and ABC said in interviews yesterday.

These are examples of new businesses the merged company could initiate:

*A combination of sports programs from the ABC-owned cable channel ESPN and children's programs from the Disney cable channel that can be sold to international broadcasters who want more of those two kinds of programs.
