The actor and director Mark Duplass has come a long way from his mumblecore days, when he appeared in modest, low-budget movies like “Hannah Takes the Stairs,” often collaborating with his brother, Jay. Now he’s an indie stalwart, who helped create, and stars in, “Togetherness” on HBO. But he still has a taste for bare-bones filmmaking, as evidenced by “Creep,” a horror two-hander in which he stars, directed by Patrick Brice.

Mr. Brice also stars, as Aaron, a soft-spoken filmmaker for hire invited by Josef (Mr. Duplass) to a rustic cabin for a personal project, a video to be shown to Josef’s unborn son when he comes of age. Josef might have terminal cancer, you see, and wants to leave his child a filmed keepsake. Or so he says. (Josef invokes the Michael Keaton 1993 weeper, “My Life,” of which “Creep,” initially, is a kind of twisted variation.) Gradually, Aaron discovers Josef’s distressing habits (a tendency to overshare), possessions (a wolf’s-head mask, an ax) and needs, which are many (even possibly homicidal).

The found-footage conceit reaches an apex here, with the two actors sometimes passing the camera between them, in character. The tricks, of course, are in the unnerving visuals of hand-held hardware, and in the editing. Most of the tension rests on Mr. Duplass’s performance, which doesn’t approach, say, Mr. Keaton’s troubled renter in “Pacific Heights” or Jessica Walter’s obsessed fan in “Play Misty for Me.” Still, the film is remarkable, considering its minimal means and surprising lack of bloodshed, given the genre. Does it stay with you? A little.

“Creep” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence and obscene language.
