''Circumcision,'' she said, ''evolved from a religious ritual and puberty rite to a routine prophylactic practice for newborns that is unnecessary and exposes infants not only to severe pain but the possible infection that has been fatal in some cases. And when you realize how much parents pay for circumcision, $75 to $125, you realize how much money is involved; circumcision is a $100 million-a-year industry.'' Circumcisions and Insurance

Indeed, high stakes are involved in the debate over circumcision. In California, Pennsylvania, Maine, Washington and Delaware, the Blue Shield insurance organization no longer pays benefits for circumcisions, saying they are medically unnecessary, When Blue Shield of Pennsylvania stopped its coverage for the procedure in early 1987, it estimated it would save at least $1.3 million a year.

Circumcision has been practiced in some human societies for at least 6,000 years, according to medical historians. As a religious ritual, it continues to be practiced by Jews, Moslems, certain tribes in Africa and other groups.

The belief that all infant boys, regardless of their religious faith, should be circumcised began to take root in this country in the latter half of the 19th century, when some physicians advocated it for reasons of hygiene and suggested it reduced the spread of infection and venereal disease. Some Victorian-era physicians and clergymen also suggested circumcision would discourage masturbation. Steady Decline Since 1971

As recently as 1970, according to physicians' estimates, almost 90 percent of newborn boys in the United States were circumcised. But since the American Academy of Pediatrics' 1971 report, which found no basis for those endorsements, there has been a steady decline in the proportion of infant boys who are circumcised.

In 1986, the last year for which data are available, it was 59.4 percent, according to the National Center for Health Statistics of the Department of Health and Human Services.

This data suggest many American physicians are continuing to encourage parents to have their sons circumcised despite the 1971 report, apparently reflecting a belief that while the operation may be medically unnecessary it is not harmful. Some physicians say some couples request circumcision even after being advised of the report because the father of a newborn boy was himself circumcised and considers it ''normal'' or it is feared that their child might someday be ridiculed by other boys.
