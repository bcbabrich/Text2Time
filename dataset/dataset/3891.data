Aside from the obvious -- that ''E.R.'' and ''Seinfeld'' are unmatchable successes -- the first week of the new television season left most network executives groping for indications of what viewers really like, and what they really, really don't like.

Some early signs have already been smudged. After Week 1, for example, it looked as if NBC had severely dented CBS's four-comedy block on Monday with its ''League of Their Own'' lineup of female comedies. But the early news from Week 2 was that NBC's Monday comedies, most of which are despised by critics, fell backward in a big way.

That was the second bit of unhappy news for NBC, which sailed through much of the first week looking as if it was heading for an ever more dominant season. NBC threw a monster Thursday NBC at its competitors, with live ''E.R'' and a new ''Seinfeld'' that actually set records for that now venerable show.

But Sunday night NBC's new comedies, ''Men Behaving Badly'' and ''Jenny,'' trailed all three other networks, even among the young viewers NBC has declared the Holy Grail of television. Still, it was far from the worst network news of the week.
