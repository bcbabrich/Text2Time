Cathy Long, elected to fill her late husband's seat in Congress, says that when she takes office Thursday the availability of funds to remove toxic wastes from the environment will be a priority.

Mrs. Long won 51.8 percent of the votes cast in Saturday's five-way race for the post vacated when her husband, Gillis Long, a Democrat, died of a heart attack Jan. 20 at the age of 61.

Unofficial returns from the Eighth Congressional District showed Mrs. Long had 52,684 votes.

State Representative John (Jock) Scott, 37, drew 27,136 votes, or 26.7 percent, Clyde Holloway, a nurseryman and the only Republican, had 18,113 votes, or 17.8 percent, while Daniel Becnel, a lawyer, and Frank McTopy, a businessman, shared the remaining 3.8 percent.

The district stretches from the central part of the state southeast to Lake Pontchartrain. Gov. Edwin W. Edwards called the special election after Mr. Long's death.
