LUBBOCK, Tex. — Three hours before their game Saturday night against top-ranked Texas, a large group of Texas Tech players sat in the lounge area of a Holiday Inn.

The Red Raiders had stayed at the hotel Friday night, as they traditionally do for home games.

Now, in the moments before they traveled to the stadium to prepare to take on the Longhorns, they were attentively watching college football on television.

But even with the much-hyped game between No. 5 Florida and No. 8 Georgia playing on a nearby television, the players were focused on No. 9 Oklahoma State’s 59-17 rout of Iowa State.

The reason was very simple.

Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma State (8-1, 4-1 Big 12) next Saturday. Texas Tech has won 8 of the last 11 meetings between the teams.

The Red Raiders have also won their last 11 home games against the Cowboys. Oklahoma State’s last victory here came in 1944.
