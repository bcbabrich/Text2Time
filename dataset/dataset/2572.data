Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, posted a first-quarter profit and stronger-than-expected revenue, helped by fixed-income revenue, which grew 7 percent from 2003's first quarter. Net profit rose to 941 million euros ($1.1 billion), up from a loss of 219 million euros a year ago, and pretax profit rose from 234 million euros to 1.56 billion euros. The chief executive, Josef Ackermann, said the group was ''making good progress'' toward a 25 percent pretax return on equity for 2005. Despite the good news, the share price fell by 2.2 percent in Frankfurt. Petra Kappl (NYT)
