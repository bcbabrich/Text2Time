Peter J. Henning follows issues involving securities law and white-collar crime for DealBook’s White Collar Watch.

The Securities and Exchange Commission’s investigation of insider trading at Pequot Capital Management had almost as many twists as an episode of “Desperate Housewives.” Closed by the enforcement division staff, it became the subject of a Senate investigation and a report by the S.E.C.’s inspector general, reopened briefly and closed again, and finally reopened and pushed forward after e-mail messages from a divorce case emerged two years later.

The S.E.C. only began looking at trading by Pequot in 2005, including some well-timed investments in Microsoft in April 2001. When it takes that long to start reviewing trades, evidence of how information may have been passed might not be available and the memories of witnesses can fade, making it difficult to put together a case.

In the Pequot case, the key e-mail messages were on the personal computer of the accused source of the information and would have remained out of sight had it not been for that person’s former wife disclosing them. That’s even better than any nighttime drama.

Pequot and its chief executive, Arthur J. Samberg, settled with the S.E.C. by agreeing to pay nearly $28 million as disgorgement and a penalty, without admitting or denying liability, for trading in advance of a favorable earnings announcement from Microsoft. A former Microsoft employee hired by Pequot right around the time of the trading, David E. Zilkha, was named in an administrative complaint filed by the S.E.C. as being the source of the information.

The initial investigation of Pequot involved trading in a number of different companies, not just Microsoft, and was closed in 2005. The S.E.C. staff attorney conducting the investigation, Gary Aguirre, was terminated shortly before the first closure of the investigation, and there was a major controversy about whether the testimony of John J. Mack, an influential Wall Street executive who is now chairman of Morgan Stanley, should have been taken as part of the case, unrelated to the Microsoft transactions. A subpoena had been issued for him to testify, but it was subsequently withdrawn.

At a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in December 2006, Mr. Aguirre contended that the S.E.C. closed the investigation of Pequot because of outside influences. A subsequent Senate report in August 2007 castigated the enforcement division for how it conducted the investigation, and a report by the S.E.C. inspector general raised questions about contacts with outside counsel during the investigation, although it found nothing improper in the decision to close the Pequot inquiry.

The S.E.C. did reopen the Pequot investigation briefly in 2006 and took testimony from Mr. Mack, and then closed the case again. It remained dormant until early 2009, when it received from Mr. Zilkha’s ex-wife the e-mails stored on the hard drive of his computer that he had received from another Microsoft employee telling him about the company’s positive earnings back in April 2001.

While the S.E.C. had some e-mail traffic from Mr. Samberg to Mr. Zilkha asking for any information about Microsoft, Mr. Zilkha had denied contacting anyone at the company during this period. In response to subpoenas for any communications about Microsoft, the S.E.C. claims he did not produce the e-mails that his ex-wife subsequently revealed. Without any evidence to contradict his statement, the enforcement division could not make a case because just asking for inside information is not a violation of the securities laws.

How the S.E.C. came to receive the e-mails is shrouded in some mystery. Mr. Aguirre claims that he received them from Mr. Zilkha’s ex-wife through an anonymous source in December 2008 and turned them over to Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania (who had conducted the earlier hearing into the Pequot investigation), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the S.E.C. chairman at the time, Christopher Cox. The S.E.C.’s filing against Mr. Zilkha only states that the enforcement division “was provided copies of the Spain E-mails, which had been located on a computer hard drive that was then in the possession of Zilkha’s ex-wife.”

Mr. Zilkha had threatened to file a complaint against Pequot for his termination only a few months after being hired in 2001, basing his claim on having provided valuable information about Microsoft. Pequot and Mr. Zilkha reached a settlement before filing the case in court, but it came to light as part of the divorce proceedings.

The S.E.C. filed its settled complaint against Pequot and Mr. Samberg in Federal District Court in Connecticut, but it chose to pursue the case against Mr. Zilkha in an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge. The vast majority of insider trading cases are brought in federal court, and it is interesting to consider why the S.E.C. chose the administrative route for Mr. Zilkha, yet another twist in the case.

Unlike a federal court action, which is governed by the liberal discovery rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is only limited discovery in an administrative proceeding. Depositions of witnesses are limited, and a party cannot freely issue subpoenas for documents it wishes to obtain. The discovery process is controlled by the administrative law judge and is usually much more limited because it is a streamlined process.

In the hearing itself, the Federal Rules of Evidence are not applied, which can present the S.E.C. with an advantage. While Mr. Samberg would appear to be an important witness, the S.E.C.’s enforcement division may be able to present its case without having to call him, perhaps using his investigative testimony and the settlement to show the Microsoft trades were based on inside information.

According to the filing against Mr. Zilkha, he asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to questions about Pequot’s trading and not disclosing the e-mails later revealed by his ex-wife. This can be used as evidence to establish his violation, unlike in a criminal case where an assertion of the privilege cannot be mentioned. In an administrative proceeding, this may carry even greater weight because the administrative law judge will have a stronger grasp of how this helps the S.E.C. meet its burden of proof.

There is also the perception that the S.E.C. has a bit of a “home field” advantage in an administrative proceeding, unlike in federal court where it must face a judge who may be skeptical of its claims. Pequot was a registered investment advisory firm, so the S.E.C. can obtain the full range of remedies against Mr. Zilkha based on his association with it. If the S.E.C. proves its case, then the administrative law judge can order a civil penalty and issue a cease-and-desist order against him, pretty much what the commission would get in a federal court.

After five years of an off-again/on-again investigation, the S.E.C. finally brought the Pequot case to a close. Whether it can make its case against Mr. Zilkha remains to be seen, but it has been a memorable trip regardless of the outcome.
