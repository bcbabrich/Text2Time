The last five years have been precarious ones for Doris Dillems's New Friends Place nursery school and day care center at 130 Greene Street. Rent increases and legal fees racked up in her struggle to hold on to her ground-floor space have helped to drain her resources. This month, she must leave the space where for the last 18 years she has operated one of the few day care centers in SoHo. The landlord wants to sell it, and she says she cannot afford to stay in the area. ''I'm going under unless I get some help,'' she said.

Already because of the uncertainty, some of the parents of children in New Friends are reluctantly making other arrangements. ''It's a huge hardship for parents and for the kids,'' said Faye Ran-Moseley, a 25-year-resident of SoHo and teacher at Audrey Cohen College, who is looking into alternative plans for her 3-year-old daughter. ''For a working mother, these things are the foundations of your life.''

Other past and present clients say Ms. Dillems has molded the day care center, which serves up to 40 children, ages 2 through 5, to suit the sometimes erratic SoHo artist's schedule. ''She loves artists, and she responds to their way of life,'' said Tsipi Ben-Haim, director of City Arts, a SoHo-based nonprofit arts education group, whose son went to New Friends.

In return, some SoHo artists are attempting to rescue New Friends by donating artwork for an auction to raise money for the school to pay for a new home in the area, which they say is short on affordable day care. The auction is scheduled to be held at 139 Greene Street, at Space Untitled, from Thursday to June 10. City Arts is sponsoring the effort, and the Buhl Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation, has promised to match whatever money is raised.
