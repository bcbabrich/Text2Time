The State Liquor Authority's drive against concealed ownership in drinking places resulted in the cancellation in the last week of four liquor licenses in this city and on Long Island.

The license of a fifth place was canceled because the owner had also operated a supper club that had lost its liquor license when it was found to be a congregating place of homosexuals.

Licenses canceled for concealed ownership involved Grove Bowling Inc., at 17 Grove Street, Brooklyn; Mike's Island Park Lanes, at 256 Long Beach Road. Island Park, L. I.; the Staff Inn Bar & Grill, 150 Columbus Avenue near 67th Street, and the Capo De Flores Restaurant, 2082 Madison Avenue.

Charges against the Staff Inn included also permitting the premises to become disorderly and catering to homosexuals who conducted themselves in an offensive manner.
