WASHINGTON, Jan. 31â€”The term of James L. Robertson on the Federal Reserve Board expired today with no decision on his successor yet made by President Johnson.

It has been learned from au thoritative sources that the appointment to the vacancy of Seymour E. Harris, professor of economics at Harvard University, is now virtually out of the question. President Kennedy had intended to appoint Dr. Harris.

The man most frequently mentioned as the likely successor to Mr. Robertson is Frederick L. Deming, president of the Federal Reserve Ban of Minneapolis.

Mr. Deming, who is regarded as a fiscal moderate, has strong support from Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Democrat of Minnesota.
