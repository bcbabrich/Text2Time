Beltran’s approval to be sent to the Rangers was not required — they were not among the 15 teams to which he could block a trade — but Cashman spoke with him earlier Monday to explain that he wanted to trade him.

It is the third time Beltran has been traded at the deadline, from Kansas City to Houston in 2004 and from the Mets to San Francisco in 2011, but he is still chasing his first World Series title.

According to a person with a team with knowledge of the negotiations with the Yankees, there was disagreement between baseball operations and the business side on whether the Yankees would become buyers or sellers. But three consecutive losses — one to Houston and the next two to Tampa Bay, convinced the owner Hal Steinbrenner to green light the trades of Miller, Beltran and Nova.

There was broader agreement on Chapman after he declined to discuss a contract extension.

Of the series in Tampa Bay, Cashman said: “A true playoff contender, not a playoff pretender, wouldn’t do that. And that’s been our season a little bit to this date.”

Cashman said the Yankees would still be trying to win, but acknowledged that they would be evaluating prospects along the way. First baseman Tyler Austin, Sanchez and Judge, who is expected to be activated Tuesday after missing three weeks with a knee injury, could be on their way soon from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and Luis Severino or Chad Green will move into the rotation Wednesday to replace Nova.

What it means for the remaining mainstays is uncertain.

If Beltran’s trade opened up more time at designated hitter, perhaps paving a way back into the lineup for Alex Rodriguez, Cashman and Manager Joe Girardi indicated that he would be only one of the options. Rodriguez, who is hitting .206, has seen his playing time diminish greatly in the last month. In his lone start in the last 10 days, he struck out in all four of his at-bats on Saturday.

First baseman Mark Teixeira, who said knee surgery was inevitable — be it now, in the off-season or beyond that — will continue to play, but he is a free agent at the end of the season. Like Rodriguez and the Yankees’ pitcher on Monday, C. C. Sabathia, Teixeira was an integral part of the last championship team in 2009.
