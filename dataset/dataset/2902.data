Russia's No. 2 oil producer, Yukos Oil, said yesterday that it would pay $190 million to Benton Oil and Gas of Houston to buy a 68 percent stake in Arctic Gas, a Russian natural gas company with about 1.2 billion cubic meters of reserves. Yukos will buy an additional 20 percent from minority shareholders. The purchase will increase its oil and gas production by 20 percent in 2005, according to United Financial Group, a brokerage firm in Moscow. A few Russian oil companies are buying into gas fields ahead of the government's promised breakup of the monopoly in Russia's gas market. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)
