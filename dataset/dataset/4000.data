If a true measure of a society is how well it treats its children, then America is in trouble. Far too many of the nation's youngsters are the victims of poverty, violence and substandard education that leave them without the basic skills to earn their way and advance in a complex society. That is why thousands of Americans will gather in Washington today for a rally designed to give voice in this election year to the needs of millions of citizens who cannot vote but who represent the nation's future.

Even before it starts, the event, called "Stand for Children," has become the focus of ideological controversy. It is sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund, whose president, Marian Wright Edelman, is a friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton and an occasional critic of Clinton welfare policies. Though today's rally has been described as nonpartisan, it is denounced by groups on the political right as an attempt to expand the welfare state.

Yet the wisdom of providing additional help to needy and neglected children seems undeniable. The most recent annual survey by the Defense Fund demonstrates that the lives of many youngsters are quite precarious.

In America today, more than one in five children lives in poverty. Contrary to popular belief, these are not mostly children in families on public assistance. More than half live in families where one or both parents are working.
