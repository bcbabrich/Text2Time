ROME, April 1— The decision taken by the New Jersey Supreme Court in the, controversial case of Karen Anne Quinlan was‐ criticized today by a professor in an interview on the Vatican radio station. The subject matter of the station's programs cosely reflect Vatican policy.

The court declared yesterday that the mechanical equipment that has been keeping Miss Quinlan alive could be turned off at the discretion of her father if doctors saw no hope for her recovery. The ruling also guaranteed that physicians attending the young woman would be legally protected from being held liable should they grant the parents’ request.

Speaking on the Vatican station, Sergio Cotta, a professor of the philosophy of law at Rome University. said that the court's decision presented “very dangerous aspects.” The ruling, he said, reflected “an exasperation of the tendency in American courts to uphold the right to privacy as a right to be able to decide anything.”

“From this point of view, each would become master of his own life,” Professor Cotta added. “One could ‐wish, or not wish, one's own death whenever one wanted.”
