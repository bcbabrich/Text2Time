A dozen Japanese banks said yesterday that they were forgiving 1.68 trillion yen ($15.1 billion) in loans to housing lenders that went bankrupt on losses from their customers' speculative investing in the 1980's. The banks said the losses had already been taken into account in earnings.

The Sakura Bank said it was waiving 280.23 billion yen in bad loans to the defunct lenders. The Sanwa Bank waived 242.58 billion yen. The other banks forgiving large loans include Daiwa, Asahi, Yasuda Trust and Banking, Mitsui Trust and Banking and Nippon Credit. (AP)
