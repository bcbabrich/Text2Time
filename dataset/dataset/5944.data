T ravel, for my taste, is an unnatural act - like washing cats or head reduction surgery. I figure no one except the hyper-pretentious would want to go someplace where you can't get Chinese take-out at 4 A.M. and use your own Vibro-Pik shower massager. People who claim that they enjoy travel are people who emboss their books with ''From the Library of ...'' or have a leather-covered steering wheel on their Toyota Tercel. Listen, if it won't arrive in New York someday on loan through a grant from Exxon Corporation, it wasn't worth seeing anyway.

Nevertheless and despite, from September through late November I have an uncompromising travel agent: the Ivy League schedule maker. For some pathological reason, I've attended 101 consecutive Columbia Lion football games, home and far away. (It'd be more than that but I can't count the 1970 Brown match. My then wife had labor contractions at kick-off and after I'd left her curbside within reasonable walking distance of Park Terrace Hospital, I just couldn't get back to Baker Field before game end. As punishment, the child, Christopher, has spent every other birthday in Providence, R.I. I can be vindictive.)

Mind you, I don't pretend to understand this obsession. But by now I have a novelist's compulsiveness about it. If I were to miss one game I know that something absolutely ruinous would happen: I'd wake up and find, say, that there is no alternate side of my street or that I've been dropped from Jung's collective unconscious on a technicality.
