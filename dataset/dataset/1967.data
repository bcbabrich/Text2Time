Having successfully directed period pieces like “The Light in the Piazza”

and “South Pacific” for Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont Theater, Bartlett Sher will soon be directing, not surprisingly,

another period piece. His next project for Lincoln Center Theater will be a revival of the August Wilson play “Joe Turner’s Come And Gone,” its producers announced. One of 10 plays in Wilson’s Century Cycle, “Joe Turner’s Come And Gone” is set in the year 1911 and tells the story of a man who finds himself in an unusual Pittsburgh boarding house on a journey north. The play is scheduled to begin previews on March 19 and open on April 16; a cast and a theater have not been announced.
