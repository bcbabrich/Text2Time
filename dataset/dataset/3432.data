The book, an argumentative memoir titled ''Truth Versus Lies,'' does not acknowledge that Mr. Kaczynski was the bomber who conducted an antitechnology campaign that killed three people and injured at least 22 from 1978 until shortly before his arrest in 1996.

As the Unabomber, Mr. Kaczynski wrote prolifically, most notably in a long manifesto of his ideas for which he won publication in exchange for his promise of a moratorium on killing and maiming. But the book offers his first extensive public comments since his arrest.

The 548-page manuscript includes angry assertions about the news media, neighbors, teachers and acquaintances. One promiscuous woman he knew, he says, was a ''damned animal.'' A school official was ''prissy.'' As a youth, he remembers, he called his mother a ''fat pig.''

The theme, however, is that contrary to what his lawyers contended, the author is not mentally ill.

Mr. Kaczynski was sentenced last year to life in prison without possibility of parole, after pleading guilty so as to avoid a trial in which his lawyers intended to argue that he was acutely schizophrenic. His family had been complicit in the idea of a mental-illness defense, he says, lying about him not only to avert a trial that might have led to a death sentence but also to skirt embarrassment over abuse that his book says had been inflicted on him since childhood. It was this abuse that led to social difficulties for him, he says, but it was more convenient for his family to maintain that he was sick.

David Kaczynski ''knows very well,'' the book says, ''that imprisonment is to me an unspeakable humiliation and that I would unhesitatingly choose death over incarceration.'' But his brother also knew, he writes, that a trial in which an insanity defense was offered would be too agonizing for him to bear.
