A picture caption on Dec. 23 with a front-page article about the unusually warm fall weather misspelled the name of a ski resort in Warren, Vt., and omitted the date of the photograph. The resort is Sugarbush, not Sugarbrush. The picture was made on Dec. 4, when slopes were barren and lifts empty. By the time of publication, about 20 inches of snow had fallen, allowing skiing to begin.
