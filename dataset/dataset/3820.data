Much of the time, Room 3-223 is a fairly harmonious place. Simone Rivera, 9, said she felt comfortable enough in class to answer honestly when another girl, Caroline Sepulveda, asked her if she had both a mother and father at home. ''I said, 'No,' '' Simone recalled the other night, her mother at her side. ''She said, 'Why?' So I told her, 'Because my mom is gay.' ''

And Hillary Fertig, the class's 23-year-old student teacher, who attended only Jewish day schools and yeshivas until age 18, said she was greeted enthusiastically when she asked several black students to teach her the rap song they were singing. ''I said, 'I'm white. Do you think I can sing it the same way as you?' '' Ms. Fertig recalled. ''They said, 'Of course.' ''

But sometimes, the students demonstrate flashes of intolerance.

Ms. Fertig said that she once watched a Hispanic girl snatch a book from a classmate, saying, ''You can't touch it because you're black.'' Jyoti Sharma, who has picked up many of the vocal cadences of her parents' native India, said a classmate had derided her accent as ''weird.''

And Seiji Iino said a boy had called him a ''nigger'' in the lunchroom. ''He doesn't even know what it means,'' concluded Seiji, whose family is from Japan and Austria.

Other students say they have been taunted, not because of their race, but for other perceived weaknesses. Christopher Barrett, an excellent basketball player who is 3 feet 9 inches tall, said he had been hurt by the catcalls of girls during games at recess. They call him Shorty.

Throughout the year, Mr. Kesler sought to eradicate his pupils' biases by presenting them with role models and road maps for how best to get along. The books he has read to them feature main characters who are about their age, but whose backgrounds are mixed.

The protagonist of ''J. T.'' is a 10-year-old boy who lives in a Harlem tenement. ''Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes'' is about a 12-year-old Japanese girl. ''. . . And Now Miguel'' tells the story of a shepherd boy in New Mexico.
