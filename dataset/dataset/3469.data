Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students examine where one develops his or her views about health and ways in which teen-agers exhibit these influences, focusing particularly on the rising trend of anabolic steroid use in teen-age girls. Students then participate in either developing and analyzing a survey of the student body regarding health and views of fitness or researching and designing an informational pamphlet containing information regarding steroid use and its dangerous effects, both which will be distributed to the student body.

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes, plus homework

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Identify and describe a famous person who demonstrates the student’s ideal image of health, the attributes this person possesses that illustrate his or her health, and the ways in which the media presents this person.

2. Develop definitions of health, parameters for what is healthy and unhealthy in terms of physical appearance, a list of where we develop our ideas of health, analysis of methods people use to alter their bodies and the safety of these methods, and ways in which people can attain physical health.

3. Examine the rising trend of steroid use in teen-age girls, the development of one’s perceptions of health, the role of various industries in affecting these perceptions, and ways in which one can healthfully attain good fitness and well-being by reading and discussing “Steroid Use by Teen-Age Girls Is Rising.”

4. Participate in either developing and analyzing a survey of the student body regarding health and views of fitness or researching and designing an informational pamphlet containing information regarding steroid use and its dangerous effects, both which will be distributed to the student body.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-paper

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboards

-copies of “Steroid Use by Teen-Age Girls Is Rising” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: Students respond to the following questions in their journals (written on the board prior to class):

-What famous person would you say demonstrates the ideal image of health to you?

-List attributes that this person has that illustrate his or her health.

-How is this person presented in the media?

Students then share their answers. The teacher should list physical attributes on the board and keep a tally of how often each attribute is listed. Then, discuss why these attributes are considered healthy and whether or not it is realistic for the majority of Americans to attain such attributes.

2. Students work in small groups to respond to the following questions:

–Without the aid of a dictionary, define health.

–What do you consider healthy-looking, and why?

–What do you consider unhealthy-looking, and why?

–Specifically, from where do we develop our ideas of health? Are any of these ideas inaccurate, and if so, which ones?

–What methods do people use to alter their bodies? In what way can each of these methods be dangerous, either physically or mentally, to the person using such methods?

–How does one attain physical health?

Students then share and discuss their answers with the class.

3. Read and discuss “Steroid Use by Teen-Age Girls Is Rising,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why might the trend in anabolic steroid use in teen-age girls be rising?

b. What might influence girls to use anabolic steroids in comparison to the reasons why boys may be influenced use them?

c. Why do athletes like Mark McGwire use steroids or steroid-like substances when their results are so disputed and may be dangerous?

d. What do anabolic steroids do to the human body?

e. Why might past teaching methods aimed at warning students of the dangers of steroid use have been ineffective?

f. What is meant by the phrase “reverse anorexia” in this article?

g. What non-physical effects has steroid use lead to as discussed in the article?

h. Why might peer education about steroid use be an effective method of teaching students about the dangers of steroids?

i. Do you agree with the final statement that “unless young people are taught to know where and how to draw the line, to know that it’s not right to try to win at all costs, they’re not going to listen when you tell them steroids put their lives at risk for the glory of winning”? Why or why not? What in our society encourages the notion that winning, particularly in athletic competition, is important?

4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Divide students into two groups. One group will develop a survey to be distributed to the student body regarding health and views of fitness, and the other group will design an informational pamphlet containing information regarding steroid use and its dangerous effects, which will also be distributed to the student body. Because the groups are working on such different products, facilitate each group, providing them with the following guidance:

SURVEY GROUP: Students in this group will design a survey to be distributed to the student body, responded to anonymously, and analyzed by group members. Students will then produce a handout with the results and evaluation of survey results. The survey should focus on the health and fitness issues discussed in the featured article and in class (views of what is considered “healthy” and “unhealthy,” influences on individuals’ views about health, ways that people “alter” their bodies, and the use of steroids). To make the survey most statistically accurate, survey questions should ask students to answer with responses such as “always, sometimes, never” or to rank views about health in order of importance. Students should also include a question about the respondent’s gender and a question about whether or not the respondent participates in athletic activities. Distribute surveys to as many members of the student body as possible (perhaps by distributing them to homeroom teachers and asking that these teachers return completed surveys to the class’s teacher’s mailbox). Then, calculate and discuss the results, and create a handout for the student body that includes this information. The handout should then be distributed to the student body.

PAMPHLET GROUP: Students in this group will use research information as the basis for an informational pamphlet to be distributed to the student body. Students should include at least the following in their pamphlet: a definition of “steroid,” an explanation of what steroids do to the human body, a discussion of why steroid use is hazardous, and a list of related resources (books, magazine or newspaper articles, and Web sites) where students can learn more about steroid use. The pamphlet should then be distributed to the student body.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Who might young athletes view as ideal pictures of physical health, and why?

–What are anabolic steroids, and how do they affect the human body? What debate is there with regards to their effectiveness?

–For what reasons do you think that the rate of the use of anabolic steroids in high school athletes has risen so dramatically in recent years?

–What teaching methods would be effective in relaying to students the dangers of using steroids?

–In what ways do the health supplement industry seem to support the use of performance-enhancing drugs?

–Why might good performance in athletics be more important than overall or future health to young athletes?

–Do athletes have a responsibility to serve as role models to children, and why?

–In what ways can one maintain physical health without resorting to potentially dangerous body enhancement techniques?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on journal entry response, participation in small and large group class discussions, and thorough and thoughtful creation and distribution of a school-wide survey and informational pamphlet about steroid use and overall health.

Vocabulary:

stardom, psychological, anabolic, steroids, anorexia, anonymous, unabated, precursor, perception, inducing, unequivocal, synthetic, prevention, congregate, injectables, preoccupation, compulsion, dysmorphism, excessive, defective, diuretic, vascular

Extension Activities:

1. Research and create an informational poster describing how steroids affect the human body.

2. Create public information posters about the ideals of beauty and health in American society, the use of drugs to enhance athletic performance, and other often unhealthy techniques used to alter one’s body. Hang posters in visible areas of the school.

3. Role-play different scenarios dealing with steroid use and other “personal image” health issues (such as eating disorders or excessive exercise). Ask students to portray various individuals encountering different situations, such as being told by a friend that he or she is taking steroids or has an eating disorder. After each scenario is played out, discuss as a class the impact of actions and reactions in these situations.

4. Write a letter to Mark McGwire or another athlete who has admitted to using steroids to enhance his or her performance. In your letter, include your views about steroids and their effects, as well as how you feel the public is affected by the use of steroids and other drugs by public figures such as athletes.

5. Create magazine or television advertisements (videotaped and shown to the class) that would serve to convince students not to use steroids or other dangerous methods to alter one’s body.

6. Examine the intensive training of athletes, particularly young world-class amateur and professional athletes, in order to prepare for competitions. What training is required in different sports? What limits are imposed on these training techniques?

7. Monitor television ads over the course of a week and keep a log of commercials dealing with health and physical beauty. What persuasive techniques do these ads use? To what results do the companies allude?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research the history of drugs used in athletics in the United States. What legislation has been passed to control body-enhancing drugs by sports figures and others?

Fine Arts- Study paintings and other art forms from past centuries, focusing on images of beauty in women. Compare those images to the images commonly seen in American culture today.

Global Studies- Learn about the methods to attain physical beauty and health common in other countries. How do some of these methods reflect other aspects of the culture, such as religion?

-Research instances of drugs used by professional athletes in other countries and the consequences, both physical and legal, that those drugs had on the individuals’ careers.

Mathematics- Calculate what Barbie, G.I. Joe, and other dolls or action figures would really look like if they were life-sized. Students take measurements of the dolls’ body parts from different angles, determine the correct ratios if Barbie were 5’7″ and G.I. Joe were 6’0″, and calculate the doll measurements into life-size based on the ratios computed. Students can also draw out these life-sized dolls on a long strip of butcher paper. Results are extremely humorous! How do these types of toys represent an unrealistic “ideal” of what males and females should look like? How do these ideals transfer to the

children who play with these toys?

Teaching with The Times- Create a bulletin board or scrapbook of New York Times articles, photographs and advertisements that focus on what is viewed as “beautiful” in American society. For each article, picture or ad included, describe how “beauty” is discussed in the item and analyze the positive or negative effects that this may have on children, adults, men and women.

Other Information on the Web:

The Federal Drug Administration Web site (//www.fda.gov) offers numerous reports and articles about the use and effects of steroids in humans.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (//www.nida.nih.gov/) supports over 85 percent of the world’s research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction and addresses the most fundamental and essential questions about drug abuse, ranging from the molecule to managed care, and from DNA to community outreach research.
