Opposition to the Duvalier Government, which has long been stifled and has been diluted by years of heavy migration, has become widespread in Haitian society in recent months, in the view of authorities on that Caribbean nation.

But these experts pointed out that while anti-Duvalier sentiment has grown, the oppressive nature of the Duvalier dynasty has inhibited the development of well-organized opposition parties.

''The opposition is genuine, broad-based and grass-roots,'' said Steven Horblitt, an aide to Walter E. Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's delegate to Congress. Mr. Horblitt, who has visited Haiti several times, most recently in December, said the opposition ''is organized in the sense that there is leadership in the church, in the business community, and among youth for it.''

Opposition Groups

There are numerous opposition groups, from Communists to Christian Democrats, among Haitian exiles, said Anthony Maingot, a professor at Florida International University in Miami. But he said it was ''virtually impossible'' to know how much support those groups have within Haiti.
