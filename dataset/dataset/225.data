Good morning. A gull cawed me awake the other morning, and I found myself grateful that it was nature and not the ping of a phone that had brought me to the surface. I thought of Jim Harrison, his poem “Age Sixty-nine”: “At dawn I have birds, clearly divine messengers that I don’t understand yet day by day feel the grace of their intentions.” The good mood lasted all day. I cooked outside at its end, Italian sausages, and I cooked a lot of them because that is what Melissa Clark taught me to do, so that on a Wednesday night afterward I could make her leftover Italian sausage sandwiches (above) for dinner, and easily, too.

You could follow my lead this evening, make and eat those sandwiches. Or you could try my slab bacon tacos with burned scallion crema instead. That’s a very nice dinner.

For a slightly fancier one: crab cakes, Baltimore-style. I like one of those per person with a big, super-lemony green salad beneath each one, and sliced peaches in cream for dessert. Or maybe just a salad, the greenest green salad Samin Nosrat gave us not so long ago?

You could cook country captain tonight, eat it with rice.

You could grill pork tenderloin with rosemary, serve it alongside mashed potato salad with scallions. On a Wednesday night! In summer! Because this is the quiet season now, August, when the nation goes slightly Gallic, and there are empty seats on the subway in New York, and no lines at the market. Also because: That tenderloin recipe, from Marian Burros, is really, really simple to make.
