Burns became a prosperous grocer and banker in a section of Hartford known as Frog Hollow, which is where the Irish Catholic immigrants then lived. The culture followed his family when it moved to prosperous West Hartford.

Initially, young John was ashamed of being an Irish-American. He found the Irish in this country a parochial lot. But as he matured and tried to define himself, he found he was drawn to Frog Hollow, which, he said, gave him a strong sense of who he was.

But, typically, he put a humorous edge on that, saying that his family went ''from steerage to the suburbs in three generations.''

As a boy, Mr. Dunne stuttered, and so he found it reassuring to write whatever it was he had to say in order to give a better account of himself. The more he wrote, the better he got at capturing the speech patterns of others on paper. His mother wanted him to be a gentleman -- a businessman -- and in preparation for that, his family sent him to the Portsmouth Priory school, a Rhode Island institution run by the Benedictines.

He did well enough there to gain admission to Princeton, from which he earned his bachelor's degree in 1954. Soon after graduation, he volunteered for the Army before he was drafted, and underwent basic training at Fort Chaffee, Ark., where he did not distinguish himself. He lost his rifle, a mistake he called ''the military equivalent of a mortal sin,'' and he failed to qualify on the firing range with whatever weapon they gave him to replace the one he had lost.

After his discharge, he dismayed his mother by choosing not to attend a business school and instead went to New York City. He worked at first for an advertising agency and eventually for Time magazine, then a highly stylized and unabashedly conservative Republican organ. Mr. Dunne remained at Time for five years and liked journalism, but decided he did not want to do it the way most journalists did.
