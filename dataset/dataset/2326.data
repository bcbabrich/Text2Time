William S. Lerach, the class-action securities lawyer most hated in Silicon Valley, and his law firm have been ordered by a federal judge in Houston to pay some of the legal costs incurred by Alliance Capital after Mr. Lerach sued the company in the Enron case. The judge says that Mr. Lerach pursed the case after it became clear it had no merit.

The ruling, under a section of the Securities Act of 1933, is unusual because in the past it appears that such penalties were always assessed on the clients — not the law firm. The judge concedes that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ruled that lawyers are not liable under that section, but says she disagrees with that decision. Since she is in the Fifth Circuit, she is not bound by the Second Circuit ruling.

There is no doubt that many a company sued by Mr. Lerach would love to sock him with its legal fees, so if this decision stands you can bet it will be regularly cited by class-action defendants.

But here is a question: Would the deterrent have been greater if the penalty had been assessed against the lead plaintiff in this class action, the regents of the University of California, rather than against Mr. Lerach’s law firm? Might such a ruling make institutional investors less willing to serve as lead plaintiffs in class action suits?
