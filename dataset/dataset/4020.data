To the Editor:

Lawrence Krauss (Op-Ed, July 29) does a disservice to the public and to the scientific community to argue that ''a theory whose predictions fail the test of experiment is always wrong, period.'' Far from it. This argument, known in the jargon of philosophy of science as ''naive methodological falsificationism,'' is indefensible.

Social scientists are familiar with debates that ensue when a theory fails to predict accurately. Do we junk the theory after a single prediction failure? Of course not. The theory may indeed be wrong. But it may also be that we did not derive the predictions accurately from the theory. Or we made mistakes in measuring the data. Or the experiment was poorly constructed, so that it was not a definitive test. Or perhaps we have run into unexplained variance, since no theory explains everything all the time.

Physicists are better than social scientists at making sure that predictions do derive directly from the theories they test. And they often have better means of measuring data than do social scientists. But few physicists I know would discard a theory for prediction failure without thinking through a number of reasons the prediction failed.

Scientific debate is about trying to agree on what experiments to conduct and how to interpret the results, in ways that can falsify theories. It is a hard discussion.
