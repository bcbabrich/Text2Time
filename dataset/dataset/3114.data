To the Editor:

Re ''Who Built the H-Bomb? Debate Revives'' (April 24): In 1968 I asked Dr. Edward Teller to write a preface to the first edition of my Instrument Engineers' Handbook, a totally unknown work then.

I asked him in particular because his participation would emphasize that this work was a Hungarian-America contribution to the progress of science. He agreed and spent a whole weekend in the library learning about automation and process control before he wrote an outstanding handbook preface.

This small episode shows that even before his heart attack, he was neither self-serving nor manipulative, but simply a generous, caring man.
