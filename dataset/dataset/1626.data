NEW ORLEANS — It is one thing to get the Alabama fans mad at you. It is quite another when the Alabama attorney general is mad and has the power to throw you in prison.

Andre Smith, the Outland Trophy winner, has been suspended for the Sugar Bowl for what multiple news media outlets are reporting was improper contact with an agent. The Alabama attorney general’s office is investigating because the state has strict laws regarding sports agents and contact with amateur athletes. The offense is considered a felony.

The story broke Monday when Coach Nick Saban announced Smith’s suspension and it did not take long for the Alabama attorney general to assign an investigator. Some news media outlets are reporting that a member of Smith’s family talked to the agent.



The N.C.A.A. said it was not involved in the investigation and the university was handling the probe. That should not surprise critics of the N.C.A.A., who claim the governing body of college athletics has lost its teeth when it comes to chasing bad behavior by its members.

This is bad news for the agent involved for several reasons. One is jail time and a hefty fine. Also consider that Alabama is going to have a slew of N.F.L.-type players in the program the next few seasons with Saban chasing the best of the best in recruiting. If an agent is responsible for Smith getting suspended, it is likely that agent and his agency will not have a chance at these Bama players.

The last time Alabama had to play a game without Smith, its all-American left tackle, the Crimson Tide stumbled around on offense and beat Tulane, 20-6, in the third game of the season. Bama rushed for 130 yards. Alabama not only played without Smith, who led one of the best offensive lines in the country, it also played without right guard Marlon Davis. The sophomore David Ross will start against Utah at left guard and Mike Johnson will move from left guard to left tackle.

Smith, by the way, told The Birmingham News he had not decided whether to turn pro or return for his senior season. Considering the life expectancy of knees in college football and the N.F.L., it is hard to believe Smith will not turn pro, especially if he is projected to go in the top five of the 2009 draft, as many expect.
