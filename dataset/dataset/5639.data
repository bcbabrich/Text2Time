Holiday Adventures is a new joint venture between Bob Guccione's Omni Publications and Flexibreaks, a London-based creator of incentive programs.

From its offices here at 604 Fifth Avenue, Holiday Adventures will be making vouchers available to participating advertisers that will be good for free rooms at thousands of hotels around the world.

According to Elaine Taylor-Gordon, whose year-old agency Taylor-Gordon Aarons & Company has just been assigned Holiday Adventures, the vouchers will be used as premiums. She said that hotels are giving up their rooms with their only incentive being the hope that the guests will then pay for other available services, such as food and drink.

She also said that Flexibreaks, a subsidiary of the Credit Corporation P.L.C. of the Isle of Man, has been successfully running such a program in Britain and on the Continent.
