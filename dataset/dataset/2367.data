Continental Airlines said yesterday that it had reached tentative agreements with its unions on $500 million in annual savings, the fifth major airline to obtain cuts from all its workers.

Continental, the nation's fourth-largest airline, had set yesterday as its deadline for getting wage and benefit concessions from pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and other workers.

Continental had warned that without the cuts it would face a cash shortage and post significant losses for 2005.

The tentative agreements, which are for 45 months, are subject to approval by leaders of each union and a vote of the members.
