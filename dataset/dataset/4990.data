''We just have to take a few steps backward,'' Courrege said, ''and evaluate where we are and where the Giants are. They have to change their offer for Lawrence to come in. Maybe ours has to change, too.''

This is the option year of a seven-year contract Taylor signed in 1984. That means he is under contract. Still, he has refused to report until he gets a contract extension.

Parcells Wants Him for Eagles

Coach Bill Parcells said he did not know how long it would take Taylor to get into game shape until he saw Taylor's fitness condition. Taylor has always said that he stays in shape by playing golf. Parcells indicated that Taylor would play against the Eagles if he reported any time between now and the game.

In an hourlong interview, Courrege said both sides were willing to negotiate a three-year contract that would cover the 1990, 1991 and 1992 seasons. But he said differences remained over how much money Taylor would receive and how it would be paid. Partly for tax purposes, he said, Taylor wants the payments spread over 10 to 20 years. Courrege said that last week he asked the Giants for a four-year deal worth $9 million.

He said the Giants had offered $4.25 million over three years and had come up ''a few hundred thousand dollars.'' He also said he had reduced his asking price. It is believed to be slightly less than $2 million a year.

Upper Echelon

Taylor indicated previously that he would accept close to $2 million a year over three years. That salary would easily make him the highest-paid defensive player in pro football history. Only a few quarterbacks make more.

''We think Lawrence is legitimately a $2 million player,'' Courrege said. ''But they're worried about the spiral effect. I told George when players come in and say they want what Lawrence gets, he should tell them when you go to the Pro Bowl nine straight years including your rookie year, you will get the same money.''
