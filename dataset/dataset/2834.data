The Bush administration announced a new vision for biomedical research on Tuesday that it said would give patients swifter access to the fruits of scientific discovery and foster greater collaboration between the government and private industry.

Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni, director of the National Institutes of Health, said the new initiatives would ''transform the way we conduct research'' by setting priorities and coordinating the work of an agency known for its highly decentralized management style.

''We are turbocharging N.I.H.,'' Dr. Zerhouni said.

The institutes' budget has doubled in the last five years, to $27.3 billion, and Congress is eager to see that the money is well spent. Two Congressional committees plan to hold a joint hearing on the agency on Thursday.

After a huge investment in basic science, lawmakers and taxpayers alike are seeking a tangible payoff: new ways to prevent or treat diabetes, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and scores of other conditions.
