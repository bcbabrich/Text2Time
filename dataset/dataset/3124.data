To the Editor:

Re ''Hard Questions on Nuclear Power'' (editorial, May 29): The least polluting, most efficient energy policy would vigorously pursue wind power, solar energy and hydrogen fuel cells.

Our current energy policies, however, are being shaped by those beholden to dirty energy. Their ideological and economic blinders even lead them to promote a revival of Frankenstein-like nuclear power. They ignore or deny the dangers of nuclear energy, the highly polluting uranium mining industry and the radioactive waste that must be isolated for thousands of years.
