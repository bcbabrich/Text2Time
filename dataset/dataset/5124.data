Mel Torme, making his 13th appearance at what is currently known as the JVC Jazz Festival on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall, showed why he is welcomed back so frequently.

Mr. Torme has never been one to rest on his laurels. Ever since he became well known as leader of the singing group the Mel-Tones through their recordings with Artie Shaw's orchestra 43 years ago, he has been a diligent searcher for what he describes as ''credible'' songs. And in the past decade, at an age when most pop singers are simply trying to hold on to what voice they have left, he has developed vocal range and control that are a far cry from the husky-toned singing of his early days when he was celebrated as ''the Velvet Fog.''

Now, at 65, still looking like a worldly cherub but showing a slimmer profile, his vocal control and coloring are continuing to develop; he showed this in beautifully projected treatments of ''More Than You Know'' and ''Midnight Sun.'' His search for new songwriters and new songs is now focused on Donald Fagan, whose song ''The Goodbye Look'' was built into a driving, dazzling blend of words and scat by Mr. Torme and his bassist, Jay Leonhart.

Mr. Torme contributed still more to the swinging energy of the concert when, as a finale, he sat down at the drums to join the clarinetist Buddy DeFranco and the vibraphonist Terry Gibbs, who had opened the evening with a set that mixed Mr. DeFranco's willowy lines and Mr. Gibbs's enthusiastic momentum.
