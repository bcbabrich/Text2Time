''People are of the perception that minorities raise third-generation hoodlums, that people have no dreams and no goals,'' said Gina Smith, a Schomburg tenant who works as an office systems analyst.

Instead, say the people who live here, they are struggling to bring up responsible children and proud to live in a community they see as stable. On a salary of $34,000, Earlean B. is raising two children of her own and two nieces she adopted after their parents abandoned them. She pays $850 a month for her four-bedroom apartment and sends her children to private schools. It is so hard, she said, that she worries when one of her sons starts to cough because she knows she cannot spare the $50 to get him to a doctor.

''You're working, you're trying to make a living,'' said the school worker, who is trying to get her youngest daughter into a private school. ''Anyplace else you go it's the same - you can't run away from it. When I go out, I take my kids with me, but you can't always keep them. When they go downstairs, you never know what will happen.''

The people who live here complain about brazen drug dealers, poor recreational facilities for their teen-agers, inadequate police protection. But many others in the neighborhood say they would not move anywhere else. They say they enjoy their proximity to Central Park, good public transportation and a strong sense of community.

''I don't think anyone here has lived in fear,'' said Sylvia Sadler, a 45-year-old mother of two children who has lived in Schomburg Plaza for 13 years. ''We are a close-knit community. If we need something, we can go to our neighbors. We want the same things for our kids as you do. I want a good education, I want them to work and strive and be the best they can be.''

This is not a community, people here say, that should be branded with the images of poverty, fear and despair. There are several low-income projects in the neighborhood, and graffiti mar some of the buildings. But there are also several moderate-to-middle-income apartments like Schomburg, where with a federally subsidized mortgage, tenant rents range from $375 for a studio apartment to $664 for a four-bedroom apartment.

There are tree-lined streets where tulips bloom and garbage cans sit in tidy rows near brownstones under renovation. According to police and census data, the neighborhood is not plagued either by sky-high crime rates or wrenching poverty.
