The Illinois outcome, although not unexpected, was viewed by many political observers as con­solidating Mr. Goldwater's large lead for the Presidential nomi­nation at the convention open­ing July 13 in San Francisco.

The Senate Republican leader, Everett McKinley Dirksen, who is chairman of the delegation, announced the results of the poll. He said that he himself had voted for Mr. Goldwater, along with the Republican gov­ernorship candidate, Charles H. Percy, a moderate.

He was asked why he had so voted, and answered, “Why, be­cause I wanted to.”

Television station WNBQ, the Chicago outlet of the National Broadcasting Company, report­ed tonight that Senator Dirksen had been asked whether he nominate Senator Gold­water at the convention. The station said Senator Dirksen re­plied that if he were asked to do so he would consider doing it.

The candidates met with the Illinois delegates in private.

Mr. Goldwater, at a wild and shouting news conference, his first in a month, called the ac­tion “very significant” and said he was “very happy about it.”

He declined, however, to pre­dict that he now had the Re­publican Presidential nom­ination sewed up.

“I wouldn't say so definitely,” Mr. Goldwater said. “If you wanted to bet me, you would need to give some odds.”

Flies to Michigan

Mr. Goldwater later flew to Lansing to appear before the Michigan delegation. This was not a strong area for him. He claims eight delegates; the As­sociated Press delegate poll re­cently gave him only two, and Governor Romney has been critical of his conservative views.

Mr. Goldwater was met at the airport by about 500 per­sons, most of them cheering admirers, but there were some hecklers. One carried a sign saying: “You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of Gold­water.”

Governor Romney personally seemed as cool as ever toward Mr. Goldwater's candidacy. He said he was “not entirely satis­fied” with Mr. Goldwater's an­swers to questions, especially on civil rights, collective bargain­ing and foreign policy.

Mr. Goldwater said he now believed he had about 690 con­vention votes, “or something along in there.” A total of 655 is needed to nominate.

But Mr. Goldwater, conscious that there could be defections, said he would “like a few more as a pad to get me over the hump.”

Mr. Goldwater told the news conference that he would de­finitely “uphold” and enforce the civil rights bill if elected President.

Reminded that he had said that genuine enforcement would demand the creation of a police state, he said he was “afraid” that the nation was “going to have a police state—I don't like that.”

But he said anyone serving as President under the bill would have to “accept increases of the police forces on a Federal level.”

“I hope to God civil rights doesn't get into the campaign,” Mr. Goldwater said when asked if he thought the action of the Iilinois delegation proved that his vote against the civil rights bill would not hurt him in the industrial Northern states.

Mr. Dirksen said that Gov­ernor Scranton, who addressed the Illinois delegation after Mr. Goldwater had done so, had made a “very excellent and pointed talk and made quite an impression.”

Goldwater Aide Buoyed

Richard Kleindienst, co‐direc­tor of field operations for Mr. Goldwater, said the poll of the Illinois delegation and the de­cision of the Ohio delegation to back a favorite son “al­most precludes the possibility of success for the stop‐Gold­water movement.”

He said that some “break for Scranton in one of those two states is almost a necessity to stop Goldwater,” but that this had not happened.

The Ohio delegation voted June 22 to cast its 58 votes on the first ballot for Gov. James A. Rhodes as a favorite son.

Mr. Goldwater appears to dis­like, even when he is winning, the extreme bustle of a meet­ing like that of the Illinois del­egation, which took place at the O'Hare Inn near the Chi­cago airport.

He had to be hustled through masses of his backers, chanting “We want Barry,” in the hotel and past persistent newsmen. he emerged from meet­ing the delegation, photograph­ers shouted for him to make a victory sign.
