“But with the law of supply and demand,” he said in an interview “things have gradually let up, and the merchandise is being moved in the old amounts pnd the pushers are willing again to deal with strangers. We also understand that prices are up now.”

Chief Taylor said the police had made an “effective start” toward enforcing the law. However, he said it would take another month or two—“when the pushers see what happens in the courts” — to determine the strength of the law as a deterrent.

Before Sept. 1 police officials said that the new law would not result in a significant increase in drug arrests, because of the department's two‐year old policy of focusing on “quality” arrests that might result in the successful prosecution of “big dealers.”

But many prosecutors and defense lawyers have been surprised by the size of the decline last month.

“We've een a clear and substantial falloff in the number of cases we would pick up,” said Howard R. Meyer, supervisor of the narcotics division of the Legal Aid Society. “Maybe the pushers are moving out of state; maybe the police are turning their backs on some things. We don't know.”

The possibility of conflict within the police force over, enforcement of the new law arose last week with the transfer of Capt. Jeremiah O'Connor, a commander of the narcotic division's Sixth District in Central Harlem.
