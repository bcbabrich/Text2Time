The Chilean Constitution, prevented Mr. Frei from suc ceeding himself, but he could be a candidate in the 1976 presi dential elections.

A new national newspaper owned by the Christian Demo cratic party appeared here this week. The newspaper, La Prensa, is part of a group of national magazines, provincial newspapers, and radio stations that are going to be, along with the Independent El Mercurio and Its affiliated newspapers, the major voices of opposition under Dr. Allende's Govern ment.

“The proof of the existence of democracy,” Mr. Frei said, “lies in the opportunity for political alternatives and in loyal respect for rules of the game that accept the perma nence of political forces out side the government that can present their own vision of problems and a different opinion.”

He said that the Christian Democrats, as well as ‘other non‐Marxist political groups, should be assured of .the right to compete equally in unions, neighborhood commit tees, mothers’ clubs and other local organizations that have been given official status under the Christian Democratic Gov ernment.

He warned that if Chile's uni versities were converted into “battlegrounds for political loyalty,” the main function of the universities of preparing educated and technically trained persons for Chile's modernizing society would be destroyed.

In an election this week at the Catholic University here, a slate of independent candidates won the leadership of the stu dent federation. The slate op posed the affiliation of the fed eration with outside political groups. It received 2,400 votes compared with 1,700 votes for a slate identified With the Pop ular Unity coalition. A left‐wing Christian Democratic slate fin ished third with 1,400 votes.

The Christian Democratic party supported the election by Congress of Dr. Allende, which became necessary under the Constitution since no candidate received a majority, in the pop ular vote. However, some Chris tian Democrats voted with more enthusiasm for Dr. Allende than others, reflecting the division between the followers of Mr. Frei, a moderate, and those of Mr. Tomic.
