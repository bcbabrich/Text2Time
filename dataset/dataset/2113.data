Updated, 4:47 p.m. | The New York City public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, called this afternoon for an official investigation into the death of her 45-year-old stepdaughter-in-law, who died in police custody at the airport in Phoenix on Friday while on her way to Tucson to enter an inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program.

In a statement, Betsy Gotbaum’s office criticized the Phoenix police’s handling of the case. The statement said Carol Gotbaum had been “manhandled” and mistreated, sentiments that the family’s lawyer echoed in an interview.

“The family has not reached a conclusion as to whether her care and treatment were inappropriate, but the circumstances were highly unusual,” Michael C. Manning, a lawyer who was hired on Sunday by the Gotbaum family, told The New York Times in a phone interview. “This woman — who was 5-foot-7, less than 110 pounds — was without doubt emotionally disturbed, and at this stage the family understands why the Phoenix Police Department intervened, but it’s what happened after the intervention that causes us concern.”

Mr. Manning said that the Maricopa County medical examiner’s office had initially scheduled an autopsy for today, but that at his request, the office had agreed to delay the autopsy by a day. Mr. Manning also said that he wanted an independent forensic pathologist to be present during the autopsy.

According to the Phoenix police, Carol Gotbaum became agitated and disruptive at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Friday after missing a 2:58 p.m. U.S. Airways Express flight to Tucson. Sgt. Andy Hill, a police spokesman, told CNN this morning:

We did receive a call that she was very loud – yelling and screaming, running around the concourse area. Two officers responded to that location. They contacted Ms. Gotbaum. They could not calm her down. There was probable cause to arrest her for disorderly conduct by disturbing the peace, which they did. It was very difficult for them to get her handcuffed, but they did not have to pepper-spray or Tase her or anything else.

One of the officers then took Ms. Gotbaum to a holding office where about seven other police employees were working, Sergeant Hill said. She was placed in a holding room with her hands cuffed behind her back, he said.

Sergeant Hill said that police procedure calls for checking on detainees at least once every 15 minutes. After Ms. Gotbaum had been in the room 5 to 10 minutes — and stopped screaming — officers who went to check on her found her unconscious, with her cuffed hands close to her neck. The officers tried to use an automated external defibrillator, and then cardiopulmonary resuscitation, to revive her but were not successful. Members of the local Fire Department arrived; they, too, could not revive her.

At 4:03 p.m. Eastern standard time, Sergeant Hill issued a statement, containing additional details about the death:

When Ms. Gotbaum was arrested and handcuffed with her hands behind her back she was taken to the holding office in Terminal 4 and placed in a holding room. There she was searched but was continuing to be vocally and physically disruptive in the holding room. Ms. Gotbaum was additionally restrained as follows: In the holding room there is a bench with an “eyehook” attached to it. The officers took a “shackle”, which is described as a metal chain, approximately 16 inches long, with a large “handcuff” on each side. The total length of the chain with handcuffs is approximately 24 inches. One of the handcuffs on the “shackle” was attached to the “eyehook” on the bench. The other handcuff of the shackle was attached to the chain of the handcuffs that were already on Ms. Gotbaum’s hands. So Ms. Gotbaum was handcuffed with her hands behind her back, and additionally those handcuffs were attached to a shackle that kept her attached to the bench. This is the best we can describe the situation at that point. All of the previous information is still the same with the addition of the information of the shackle. We still do not know how Ms. Gotbaum was able to manipulate the handcuffs to the position she was in. But when she was found her handcuffs were in front and the shackle was still attached to her handcuffs. The chain was not wrapped around her neck. It was pulled against the front of her neck area. I hope this helps. Again, the Phoenix Police Department is conducting a death investigation. The Medical Examiner’s Office will determine cause and manner of death. And the Phoenix Police Department Professional Standards Bureau is conducting an internal investigation, which is standard operating procedure.

Paul Skellon, a spokesman for Mesa Airlines, which operates U.S. Airways Express flights, said that Ms. Gotbaum was not denied boarding her flight. She simply arrived too late, he said. The door to the gate had already closed, the jetway had disengaged from the plane, and the plane was about to push back, he said.

Mr. Manning said that Ms. Gotbaum was in the Phoenix airport for what was to have been a brief layover on her way to Tucson, where she planned to enter an alcoholism treatment program. He said he did not know how long she had had a drinking problem.

The Daily News today quoted unidentified airport workers as saying that Ms. Gotbaum screamed “I’m not a terrorist!” and struggled with security officers as she was subdued.

According to Sergeant Hill, the police are investigating the circumstances of the death, as is the Maricopa County medical examiner’s office, which covers Phoenix.

Ms. Gotbaum, a mother of three, lived on the Upper West Side. Her husband is Noah E. Gotbaum, an investor who has worked in Eastern Europe. They married on June 10, 1995, at a ceremony in Central Park.

According to the couple’s wedding announcement, published in The Times, Ms. Gotbaum was a daughter of Cmdr. and Mrs. Henry B. Stiger of Cape Town, South Africa. At the time, Ms. Gotbaum was a senior buyer in London for the House of Frasier, a department store company. She received an M.B.A. from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Her father retired as the commander of the South African Navy Diving School in Simonstown. Her previous marriage had ended in divorce.

Mr. Gotbaum was a director of the Central Europe Trust Company, a consulting and investment firm in London. He graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1977 and from Amherst College in 1981, and he received a master’s degree in public policy management from Yale University in 1989.

Mr. Gotbaum is the son of Victor Gotbaum, who for many years was executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city’s largest alliance of public sector unions, and his former wife, Dr. Sarah C. Gotbaum. Victor and Sarah Gotbaum divorced in the early 1970s.

Betsy Gotbaum married Victor Gotbaum in 1976. Betsy Gotbaum has been the city’s parks commissioner and the president of the New-York Historical Society. In 2001, she was elected public advocate; she was re-elected in 2005. As the city’s second-highest-ranking official, the public advocate is first in line to be mayor if the mayor should die or become incapacitated.

Betsy Gotbaum told reporters in a statement outside her Central Park West home on Sunday:

This is a horrible tragedy for my family, for my stepson and my three grandchildren. Carol was a wonderful person. She was a wonderful mother. She was sweet and kind and loving. At this moment we are awaiting the results of the investigation. We don’t know any more than what has been reported in the press. This is obviously very, very difficult for us. We are dealing with it as best we can. My No. 1 focus is those children and my stepson. And I hope the press will consider our feelings and please, please, please don’t ask us any more questions. We made the statement. We will let you know as soon as we can. Thank you.

Ms. Gotbaum’s office released a further statement this afternoon:

We are not jumping to any conclusions, but the circumstances surrounding Carol’s death appear to be unusual enough to raise serious questions and warrant a thorough investigation. Carol, who was only five foot seven and one-hundred and five pounds, appears to have been manhandled by the Phoenix Police Department. She was a loving and devoted mother of three children under the age of nine who was on her way to an alcohol rehabilitation facility to seek treatment for herself. She cried out for help at the airport, but her pleas appear to have been met by mistreatment.

A woman who answered the telephone at a home of Carol Gotbaum’s relatives in Cape Town said the family did not wish to discuss the death. “This is a private family matter,” the woman said.

Lawrence Kobilinsky, an expert in forensic science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that any number of factors might cause a person to die very quickly, including a heart attack, a cardiac arrhythmia or an aneurysm. Any death investigator would also examine whether drugs — prescription medications or illegal narcotics — were in the person’s system. Overdoses of methamphetamines and cocaine, among other illicit drugs, can be life-threatening.

Dr. Howard C. Adelman, an independent forensic pathologist and a former chief deputy medical examiner in Suffolk County, said there have been cases in which police officers, in subduing a suspect, have placed pressure on the person’s chest, constraining the ability to breathe. Similarly, there have been cases where people have been restrained, hogtied or handcuffed in an unusual position, causing them to asphyxiate. In a situation known as excited delirium, a person begins to act in a highly agitated state. That can lead to the release of adrenaline, which in turn could cause a cardiac arrhythmia.

Both experts emphasized that they were speaking about general possibilities and that an autopsy would have to be conducted to determine the cause of death.
