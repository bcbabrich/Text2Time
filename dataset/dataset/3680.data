With the lockout of the National Basketball Association's players keeping him from tutoring his players, John Calipari spent nearly an hour yesterday conducting a clinic for children at River Dell High School in Oradell, N.J. When he was finished, Calipari insisted that despite holding an escape clause in his contract after the upcoming season, he would not use it.

Even before the change in ownership, members of the Nets organization thought Calipari would use the clause in his five-year, $15 million deal to negotiate an extension. And Calipari has speculated in the past that he would like to be with the Nets at least eight years. But he has maintained that the escape clause was only in place to insure that the organization would head in the proper direction.

The idea was, let's see where this thing goes, Calipari said. Right now, the way it looks, where we're going, I want to be a part of it for a long time. It was not to renew a contract. I'm not going to ask anybody to change what I have. I won't. I signed a contract for five years and I'm not changing it. I'm not going to go in and say I want more of this because this guy got more.
