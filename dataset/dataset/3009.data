He soon noticed that his teammates did not share those concerns. We'll catch them by the All-Star Game, they said, build up the lead in the second half and clinch with a week or more left in the season.

It happened.

''It's like clockwork -- they know,'' Giambi said. ''That's the thing that makes them so good: they never panic. They know their game plan and what they're shooting for. I mean, it's amazing, when you hear about it, to be a part of it. The Yankee mystique.''

Curt Schilling might not buy that, but Giambi does, or at least he sells it well. He speaks reverently of the team and the city, the energy and the excitement. Words like incredible and unbelievable flow freely when he talks.

Giambi said he was not concerned that he would put too much pressure on himself the way he did at the start of the regular season. Through his first 15 games, Giambi hit .255, with two homers and six runs batted in. He finished at .314, with 41 homers and 122 R.B.I.

''I was walking out the first month trying to hit 40 home runs in one game,'' said Giambi, who batted .388 with nine homers in September. ''I'm no longer at that period. Now it's take good at-bats, take a walk or drive in a big run, the same things I basically did in Oakland but being comfortable with my surroundings, with my routine.''

Early in the season, Giambi was not so much in awe of Yankee Stadium as he was frustrated by it. He had four hits in Game 5 of the division series at Yankee Stadium last fall, his last game with the A's, but entered this season batting just .245 in the Bronx, with one homer.

''This ballpark,'' Manager Joe Torre said, ''isn't quite as friendly as Oakland was for him, because of his ability to hit the ball to left-center. That spot's 399 here, and it's a little bit shorter in Oakland. The tendency, when you're in a lull, is to try to pull it to right field.''
