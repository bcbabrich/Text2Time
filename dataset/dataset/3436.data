Imam Hasan Hasalari, the Muslim leader of the village of Rejance, said an army troop truck pulled up outside his home at 7:30 A.M.

''I was afraid to go out,'' he said. ''Then just 500 yards away heavy shooting broke out and big explosions. Then I was afraid to stay in the house. I saw people running out the back and I climbed out of a window and ran.''

Imam Hasalari ended up with 2,000 to 3,000 others clamoring to cross the border at General Jankovic, but they found their way blocked by Serbian police. Turned back because they had no papers or passports, the refugees stood in the street all day in rising panic as the police carried out house-to-house searches in the village. By early evening the refugees had been given shelter in houses there. In one house just off the main street, about 30 women and children filled a single room. Shemsije Sermjani, a nervous young woman with dark rings round her eyes, told of how they had fled their village, Palivodenica, at 10 in the morning. ''We heard shooting and saw army patrols moving up into the hills above,'' she said.

''For two weeks, we had been watching the troop movements around. We were all ready to leave at any moment.'' She said her 80-year-old father and her brother had stayed in the village to watch their house and animals. ''We don't know what will happen,'' she added. ''It is very hard.''

About 90 percent of Kosovo residents are ethnic Albanians, most of whom are Muslims.

Villagers said Serbian forces had begun their action by attacking the village of Pustenik, a known stronghold of ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and then swept on through neighboring villages.
