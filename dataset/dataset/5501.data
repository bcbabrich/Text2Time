BIG IS BOLD, BIG IS GENEROUS, BIG IS welcoming - and so are the oversize objects that are asserting themselves on the most fashionable table tops across the country. ''In the old days, everything had to be on a small scale, but today, overstatement is what looks good,'' explained Mario Buatta, the well-known New York City interior decorator. ''Nothing looks better on a buffet table than a very large plate.'' ''Big objects make a statement, don't get lost in the shuffle and have a lot of presence,'' added Peri Wolfman, a co-owner of Wolfman-Gold & Good Company, which operates two Manhattan home-furnishings shops.

From extravagantly proportioned silver-toned disposable plastic platters to dramatic oxidized copper containers and sandblasted acrylic bowls the size of small watering holes, large serving pieces are convenient for a crowd as well as attractive on their own.

Mr. Buatta, a habitue of elegant dinner parties, particularly admires the practical aspects of the oversize accessories. ''Big dinner plates not only make the food look nicer, but are much easier to handle when everything has to be balanced on one's lap,'' he said.

And who could deny the indispensability of a huge napkin - or the added appeal of a smaller, lace-edged one folded inside it -when one is desperately trying to avoid spilling anything on party clothes?
