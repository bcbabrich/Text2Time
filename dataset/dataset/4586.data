IL Sogno in Hewlett has been a closely held secret in the Five Towns, its regular patrons having filled the elegant little Italian storefront every noon and night for the last two years.

Strangers were a rarity. When I called for a reservation, as always using an alias, the person answering said, "You've never been here before." When we arrived, the maitre d'hotel greeted us with, "Is this your first visit?"

Despite our newcomer status, we received the same warm, heartfelt Italian welcome, as did valued regulars.

Our enthusiastic host dominated the tiny room with his animated descriptions of specials and promises of, "Let me make it nice for you." He was also Johnny on the spot, taking orders, pouring wine and promptly catching diners' signals.
