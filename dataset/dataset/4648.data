In 1971 a group called the Beginning of the End had its only hit with "Funky Nassau," a mixture of funk and Bahamian junkanoo, the drum-driven music of street parades. Two decades later, the Baha Men, Bahamians from Brooklyn, have revived both the song and the idea. The album the group plans to release in September is called "Junkanoo" (Atlantic), but the music the Baha Men played on Thursday night at S.O.B.'s might better have been called "funkanoo."

On the stage was the Baha Men's funk band half -- guitars, keyboard, bass, drums -- while other band members, playing junkanoo drums (with Sterno torches inside) and shaking cowbells, strutted on the dance floor; the band members wore bright tropical colors and fancifully decorated straw hats. But while funk and junkanoo share a heavy downbeat, the band's hybrid songs leaned toward funk, with Nehemiah Hield's lead vocals sliding in Stevie Wonder style and the band switching between major-key junkanoo vamps and modal funk. The Baha Men's lyrics are tourist fare, full of beaches and coconut drinks, but the words are mostly pretexts for danceable rhythms.

The Baha Men are a good funk band, looking back to the early-1970's efforts of Mr. Wonder, Parliament and others. But the junkanoo rhythm section that could make the music distinctive was largely a visual effect until, as a finale, the band paraded off stage across the dance floor. Then, the bumptious, jaunty junkanoo rhythm finally surfaced.

The Baha Men are to perform tomorrow at 3 P.M., with the soca singer Superblue, at the Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, mid-park at 72d Street.
