"Turnover causes us tremendous heartburn," said Robert Coletta, general sales and service manager for G.M.'s Buick division. Salespeople, he said, need about a year to fully understand a manufacturer's products and a dealer's procedures. And as cars grow more complex, he added, that learning period grows longer.

One of the earliest deferred bonus plans began two years at Volkswagen, which for every car sold pays the sales representative $150 -- in three installments, spread over two years. The bonus comes on top of whatever commission the dealer pays the sales staff. Volkswagen officials have no statistics on whether the program has reduced turnover, but they say dealers have told them it has helped.

Audi of America offers yearly bonuses of $6,000 to salespeople who sell 60 cars, and $12,000 and a trip to Germany to those who push 120 cars out the door. The wait is not as long as with Volkswagen's program but the idea is the same: to keep top producers in the fold, some of whom had left as sales drooped.

"If you lose a guy who's worth a hundred cars a year, it's like losing a whole dealer," said Joseph H. Tate, general sales manager of Audi of America.

Fritz Hitchcock, the owner of the Toyota dealership where Mr. Salcido works, calls the traditional commission system "very destructive." But Mr. Hitchcock, who has set up his own deferred-bonus program, doubts whether other alternatives -- some sort of guaranteed salary, say -- would be the answer. "It's hard to figure out if a guy is giving you his all if he's on a guarantee as opposed to a commission," Mr. Hitchcock said.

Mr. Salcido and other salesmen said that deferred bonus programs like the one offered by General Motors were a nice perk, but were not enough to make salespeople stick around after several slow months at a dealership. "It's an extra, but people want money now, said one Detroit-area car salesman who insisted that he not be identified. "My mortgage bill is now." An Inherently Transient Business

Salespeople and car dealers say they applaud any programs designed to reduce turnover and improve the image of salespeople. But many also believe the incentives or courses do not address the fundamental realities of selling cars that make it such a transient business: long hours, few benefits and unpredictable paychecks.
