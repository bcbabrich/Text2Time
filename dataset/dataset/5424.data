And Senator Bob Dole, whose home state and base of support lies just across the border in Kansas, is presenting himself as practically a native son who ascended to national prominence as the Senate Republican leader. ''Wouldn't it be nice to have somebody in the White House you can sit down and talk to about agriculture?'' he asked voters in Ames on Saturday.

To the many analysts who say Mr. Kemp cannot possibly beat that kind of opposition, his strategists reply that he does not need to. They believe that if they can keep expectations fairly low, all Mr. Kemp will have to do is run a reasonably strong third in the caucuses for everyone to say that he did ''better than expected.'' A Long-Shot Strategy

Then, his strategists hope, in subsequent primaries either Mr. Bush or Mr. Dole will falter, leaving Mr. Kemp as the come-from-behind long-shot challenger whom the public and the press have to keep their eyes on.

Under current campaign rules, Mr. Kemp can devote a maximum of about three-quarters of a million dollars to his Iowa campaign, and he plans to spend every penny of that. How much of a strain that will place on his efforts in other states depends largely on whether he can improve his fund-raising, political analysts say.

June may be a critical month. He is scheduled to be on the road one out of every two days seeking contributions around the country.

Mr. Kemp expects that no more than 150,000 voters will turn out to support a Republican candidate in the Iowa caucuses. He believes his image and message will appeal to the large evangelical Christian community, abortion opponents, senior citizens, and young conservatives who look upon Mr. Bush as too dull and Mr. Dole as too somber. Appeal to Typical Republican

Demographic studies describe the typical Iowa Republican as a 55-year-old church-going white Protestant from a small town, a member of the Elks, Rotary or other service organization who, while not a farmer, works in a business related to the farming economy, such as agricultural supply, retailing or banking. Some of the themes Mr. Kemp has been stressing since he announced his candidacy almost two months ago would appear to appeal to such a voter. The Representative advocates getting tough with the Russians, cutting taxes and outlawing abortions.
