Brooklyn prosecutors said they would drop the murder case against a retired F.B.I. supervisor, Roy Lindley DeVecchio, after tapes discredited the main witness, a gangster’s mistress. The tapes came to light in a report in The Village Voice by the reporter Tom Robbins that showed that the main witness, Linda Schiro, had changed her account and damaged her credibility.

As Michael Brick explains in a front-page article, it was a major reversal for the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, who filed state murder charges last year despite a federal investigation that had cleared Mr. DeVecchio, saying the case was “the most stunning example of official corruption that I have ever seen.”

The Daily News reports that once the charges are dropped, which is expected to occur today, Mr. Hynes is expected to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Ms. Schiro for perjury.

The New York Post reports that Ms. Schiro never mentioned the 1997 interview tapes in many meetings with prosecutors in the early days of the case and that investigators “were totally blindsided” when The Voice’s article was published online. Prosecutors have been paying Ms. Schiro $2,200 a month for rent and food since March 2006, according to The Post.

Real Estate Agent Is Found Slain in Fifth Avenue Home

Linda S. Stein, 62, who helped pioneer the punk music scene, influenced the careers of Madonna and the Ramones and went on to become known as a real estate agent to the stars, was found bludgeoned to death Tuesday night in her apartment at 965 Fifth Avenue, the police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

The building, at the corner of 78th Street, has the security of doormen and elevator operators, as well as surveillance cameras mounted on the sidewalk canopy and in the lobby, but a reporter found an unlocked service door on the side street. There were no signs of forced entry at the apartment, nor did anything appear to be missing, investigators said. Ms. Stein’s body was found face down in the living room in a pool of blood, the police said. She was wearing a sweatshirt with a hood, which was pulled over her head. Investigators at first believed the bleeding could have resulted from a fall, but when the hood was pulled back, a severe skull injury was exposed. The medical examiner’s office ruled the death a homicide.

The New York Post reports that investigators are talking to building employees and a construction crew, among others. As The Daily News notes, Ms. Stein sold 20 to 30 properties a year, often to celebrities, in deals ranging from $2.5 million to $30 million. The real estate agent who shows Charlie Sheen an apartment in the movie “Wall Street” was reportedly based on her.

Survivor of Steam Blast Is to Be Released Today

Gregory McCullough, 21, a student and tow truck driver from Canarsie, Brooklyn, who was driving with a customer through traffic during the evening rush on July 18 when a steam pipe exploded beneath the intersection of 41st Street and Lexington Avenue, near Grand Central Terminal, is to be released today from NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. He was critically burned in the accident and placed in a medically induced coma to relieve the tremendous pain. In an interview with Trymaine Lee of The Times, Mr. McCullough recalled: “I woke up and I started to cry. I didn’t understand. Why me? I did everything I was supposed to do. I was making a living and going to school. I didn’t deserve this. I didn’t deserve all of this pain. I didn’t deserve any of this.”

Travel Costs Rise Across the Region

In the past year, New York City cab riders and New Jersey Transit passengers have been asked to pay more. Next month, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board will vote on whether to raise tolls and fares on its subways, buses, commuter rail lines, bridges and tunnels by an average of 6.5 percent. Now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is hoping to raise tolls by at least a third on its Hudson River crossings early next year — the first increase since 2001. The changes amount to “one of the biggest and most sustained rounds of fare and toll increases in decades,” Ken Belson and William Neuman explain.

First Conviction Under State Terror Law

In State Supreme Court in the Bronx, jurors for the first time found a defendant guilty under a New York statute passed after 9/11 to guarantee harsher sentences in terrorism cases. The defendant, Edgar Morales, did not fit the stereotype of a terrorist. He is a 25-year-old recreational soccer player and gang member who fatally shot a 10-year-old girl and wounded a second man outside a christening party in 2002.
