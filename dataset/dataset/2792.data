The preacher, a Yale Law School graduate, bowed his head before the television cameras and prayed, ''We ask for miracles in regard to the Supreme Court.''

Well, don't we all from time to time. But it's a relief to report that this particular prayer of the Rev. Pat Robertson, the TV evangelist and chronic politician, is going unheeded. Mr. Robertson has been beseeching heaven to strike the Supreme Court with divinely enforced retirements. But the 21-day ''prayer offensive'' for an almighty purging of court ''liberals'' (sic) is winding down with the court intact and on a well-earned vacation.

''They've entered into the arena on the side of evil,'' Mr. Robertson told his flock after the court voted to strike down Texas's criminalization of consensual homosexual behavior. He had the garishly bad taste to dwell on the ages and infirmities of some of his least favorite jurists.

This sort of pulpit tomfoolery would hardly seem worth any attention if Mr. Robertson were a less politically significant figure. But he is the founder of the Christian Coalition, which is still taken seriously, and he had a credible following as a presidential candidate. The flirtation with the politics of religious righteousness will undoubtedly turn up in the next election cycle, even if it's in less ludicrous garb.
