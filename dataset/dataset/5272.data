Stanford University reached the College World Series for the fifth time in seven years today. A 16-2 victory over Kentucky, the second over the Wildcats in two days, allowed the defending champion Cardinal to win the Northeast region of the national collegiate tournament and continue a tradition that is as challenging as it is happy.

After winning the double-elimination tournament following an opening-game loss, and after having to defeat the Wildcats twice with freshman starting pitchers, the Cardinal players realize that the hard part has not yet begun.

The College World Series starts Friday. And so do final examinations. ''I've got to take them home and try to figure out how we're going to take finals,'' said Mark Marquess, the Stanford coach. ''I want my seniors to graduate and the rest of the team to be back next fall.'' On the Brink

Four days ago, the Cardinal (41-22) nearly avoided a conflict between the National Collegiate Athletic Association baseball calendar and the end of Stanford's academic quarter. Last Friday, the Cardinal lost to St. John's and was tied with Fordham in the eighth inning.
