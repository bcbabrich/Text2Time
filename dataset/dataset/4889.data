Leading the conference was Mariana O. Beraja, a first-grade teacher who is the cabinet's chairwoman. Dr. Stone, who will become principal of a school that she has designed, sat at Mrs. Beraja's left shoulder and, in theory, had no larger voice than any of the members, though her remarks seemed to carry more weight. Ultimately, she could veto a cabinet decision, though she has never had to do that.

Throughout the meeting, cabinet members freely offered their suggestions, with Dr. Stone listening intently. Though she has relinquished some authority to the cabinet, she continues to play the principal's typical role. She visits classrooms and evaluates teachers. She sees parents who may have complaints or questions. She handles repairs, purchases and correspondences.

''I'm still the final word, the final sign-off,'' she said.

But decisions that affect curriculum, working conditions and pupil achievement are made by the cabinet, of which she is only a member. The cabinet, in some ways, also has broader powers than principals usually do. The 130 school-based management schools can ask the Dade County School Board for waivers on spending money earmarked for special programs, waivers from the teachers' union contract and even waivers from state rules.

Several years ago, the Hadley cabinet decided that the school's children were doing too little writing and too many rote exercises using photocopied work sheets, and so it set a limit of 12 copies a teacher per month. When a vacancy opened up for a kindergarten teacher, cabinet representatives interviewed the 15 applicants. When teachers do the selection, Mrs. Beraja said, ''we as peers get together and make sure that person is successful, because we hired her.''

More Report Cards

At the Bunche Park Elementary School in Opa-Locka, a school that has a sizable program for handicapped and mentally retarded children, the cabinet decided that teachers would issue report cards six times a year, rather than four as in most district schools, and require parents to pick them up on two of those occasions. Shy or resistant parents would thus be compelled to meet their childrens' teachers.

''It's school-based management at it best,'' said Suzan Hess, a teacher-administrator who is chairwoman of the cabinet. ''No other school did it. It was generated by our staff because we felt our population of parents needs this information.''

Kathleen Phillips, a speech specialist at Bunche Park, did not like the idea of teaching children who had been pulled out of their regular classes, and she decided she wanted an all-day classroom for children with speech handicaps. She wrote a proposal to the cabinet, she recalls, and ''they said, 'Great, go for it.' ''
