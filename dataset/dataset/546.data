Black Friday deals and postelection confidence helped pull November auto sales in the United States out of their recent slump — and increased the chances that 2016 could set a record for new vehicle sales.

Total sales were expected to rise 4 percent for the month to 1.37 million units, according to Kelley Blue Book. That would be the highest November for United States sales on record, beating the previous record of 1.32 million set in 2001.

Bill Fay, Toyota division general manager, said November’s sales were so good that the industry might even break last year’s sales record of 17.47 million.

“I think it will be right around last year’s record, maybe a little bit less,” Mr. Fay said. “But I think either way everybody will sign up for a lifetime of this.”
