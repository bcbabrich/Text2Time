PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. — In his 18th career start at the Honda Classic, Davis Love III equaled the course record of 64 at PGA National Resort and Spa. Love’s round included a hole-in-one at the par-3 fifth.

Love, the 2012 U.S. Ryder Cup captain, equaled the mark set by nine players, including Graeme McDowell and Rory Sabbatini in 2011. The last time Love scored lower than 64 was during the third round of the 2005 Bob Hope Classic.

“I’ve been hitting the ball real well,” Love said, “and a lot of tournaments last year I just didn’t get off to a good start. I had a lot of even par the first day or 1-over, and just get behind the 8-ball. So I’m just glad to be off to a good start.”

Love’s ace, the fifth of his PGA Tour career, came with a 5-iron from 195 yards.



“It hit, I don’t know, three or four feet short and I don’t know if it bounced once or twice but went right in,” Love said. He added: “That was a big boost. I obviously hit a good shot, but you’re lucky when they go in.”

Love had seven sub-70 rounds in 22 starts in 2011. In his first three starts this year, he made one cut, tying for 20th at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.

“I did some work with my short game and putting and things between Pebble and now to get ready for here,” Love said. “I worked on iron shots, because you’ve got to hit good iron shots on par 3s to survive this golf course, so it paid off today. Yeah, it’s fun to break, tie the course record, and it’s fun to shoot low scores.”
