''The only people who did not lose money were those who couldn't put their hands on any,'' said Mr. Prushi. ''There were people who sold their houses, others sold their cows, and now their children don't even have milk.''

Mrs. Rinxhi reached for the cigarettes she started smoking again when the crisis began, her eyes filling with tears. ''We are in a terrible situation,'' she said. ''It can't be worse.''

Today Mr. Xhaferri is in jail, his fund seized by the Government; Marta, the woman who ran the local Xhaferri office, collecting wads of leks -- the Albanian currency -- from people who spent hours waiting in line, has disappeared. And the people of Fushe-Kruja, a shabby, dusty town of 25,000, responded last weekend by joining the rest of the country in street demonstrations, which, in some places have turned into near-riots.

Thrown on the defensive, the center-right Government of President Sali Berisha has promised to restore at least some of the missing money to the people on Nov. 5, to be distributed through savings account passbooks and options to bid on state property. The Government has also lashed out at its already feeble opposition and has blamed opponents for fomenting the violence last weekend.

But here, where the demonstrations were peaceful, residents insist that the Government is to blame for the catastrophe that has befallen them. Like many others, they are waiting to see if President Berisha fulfills his promise. ''We want our money,'' said Mr. Prushi. ''We don't want pieces of paper.''

Fushe-Kruja, like many small towns in this nation of 3.5 million, was a relative late-comer to the national craze, which by October of last year had reached frenzied levels. By then funds like Xhaferri were stepping up efforts to collect more money, opening new offices, promising ever higher rates of return over ever shorter periods of time -- all signs that the bubble was about to burst.

But when Mr. Xhaferri came here, nobody really wanted to ask him hard questions, like how he could promise to triple their money in three months in a country with meager investments and 20 percent unemployment.
