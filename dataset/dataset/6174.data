Creation of the egg board follows by three months a ruling by a Federal Trade Commission judge that the egg industry had engaged in deceptive advertising by contending that the possibility of a heart attack is not increased by eating eggs.

“There exists a substantial body of competent and reliable scientific evidence that eating eggs increases the risks of heart attack or heart disease,” the judge said in his ruling against the National Commission on Egg Nutrition. Hendrik Wentink, chairman of the egg commission, called the decision an “unprecedented intrusion upon our right of free speech.”

One of the reasons the egg board is being established, said an Agriculture Department spokesman, is that “they want to get this research program going on the cholesterol business.” He added that a “lot of money” raised for the board will probably go for studies on the cholesterol level in eggs and its relation to heart disease.

However, the spokesman added that the major objective of the board will be to reverse declining egg consumption in the country. A poultry official at the Department of Agriculture said the egg board would not adopt a U.S.D.A. label in its advertising.

Prompted by an article in the Merchandising Magazine a few months ago proclaiming that was sale of Diet products was near the $90 million sales mark in chain drug stores and that the peak sale periods were durinf the spring months—when visions of bathing suits nag almost everyone—the consumer affairs committee of Americans for Democratic Action has countered with a new report attacking the usefulness of diet aids.
