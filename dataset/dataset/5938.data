The Supreme Court ordered the Government today not to carry out its decison of last month to halt flights of the national airline, El Al, on the Sabbath and holidays, Israel's state radio reported.

The Cabinet and Parliament, which had endorsed the decision, were given 45 days to explain it. Transport Minister Haim Corfu, a member of Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Likud bloc, said in a radio interview that the Government would ''abide by the court's decision.'' He said that the Attorney General would be asked to reply to the order ''earlier than the time alloted by the court.''
