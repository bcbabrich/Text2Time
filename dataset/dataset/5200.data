The confirmation that Patrick Bissell, the 30-year old star of American Ballet Theater who was found dead Tuesday of unexplained causes, had had problems with drug abuse and alcoholism has led to a sharp exchange of views on the use of drugs by dancers, and on a therapy program established by Ballet Theater.

The company's executive director, Charles Dillingham, said in interview yesterday, ''I think drug abuse is extremely rare in the ballet world.'' He said that at the time of his death, Mr. Bissell was participating in a therapy program instituted by the company and that he appeared to have been making progress.

A contrary view was expressed in a written statement by Gelsey Kirkland, a former ballerina with Ballet Theater who often starred with Mr. Bissell. ''The death of Patrick Bissell was an unavoidable tragedy caused at least in part by the failure of the ballet world and American Ballet Theater in particular to acknowledge and deal openly with the drug problem,'' she said. She declared that she was willing to offer the company ''whatever support I can in developing a special drug policy.'' In Ms. Kirkland's 1986 autobiography, ''Dancing on My Grave,'' she discussed her own problems of addiction and charged that Mr. Bissell introduced her to cocaine. Statements From Ballet Theater

Speaking for Ballet Theater in a written statement, Mr. Dillingham countered Ms. Kirkland's charge by saying, ''We consulted with outside agencies who were professional rehabilitation advisers to sports and entertainment institutions as large and larger than ours.'' In another written statement, the company's artistic director, Mikhail Baryshnikov, said, ''We don't need Gelsey Kirkland or the publisher of her book, Doubleday & Company Inc., which issued her statement, to tell us how we could have prevented Patrick Bissell's tragedy and completely misrepresent the company's ongoing program to provide rehabilitation for Patrick Bissell.'' A toxicology report on the cause of Mr. Bissell's death is not expected for two or three weeks, according to officials of the medical examiner's office in Hudson County, New Jersey, where Mr. Bissell lived.
