What we’re reading on Thursday morning.

The Corner Where Music Never Dies: In the Rooms column of Thursday’s New York Times, Alan Feuer visits a studio on West 44th Street in Manhattan where a team from Sony Music Entertainment is preserving the company’s archives — the work of artists from Sousa and Caruso to Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan and Miles Davis. “Everything falls apart,” one archivist says. “We want to be the last best place in the world where all this stuff can be preserved.”

Dudamel’s Debut: The Associated Press reports on Gustavo Dudamel‘s first rehearsal as the conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Mr. Dudamel, 28, who showed up to work in black sneakers, discusses the contents of his iPod (Oscar D’Leon, Pink Floyd, Pasion Vega and Juan Luis Guerra) and tells reporters at a press conference, “Classical music is cool.”

Seattle Museum’s ‘Faustian’ Tower Deal: Writing for Bloomberg News, James S. Russell recounts the tale of the Seattle Art Museum’s 16-story extension, attached to the 42-story headquarters of Washington Mutual Inc. The extension opened in 2007 at a cost of $86 million, but its future has been jeopardized by the collapse of that bank.

Wanna Be Sedated? If any subplot of “Entourage” had to come true, at least it was this one: The Hollywood Reporter says that Fox Searchlight is in negotiations to produce a biographical film about the punk rock band the Ramones, adapted from the coming memoir “I Slept With Joey Ramone” by that singer’s brother, Mickey Leigh, and Legs McNeil. No casting has been announced but Vincent Chase is presumably available.
