Administrivial Will Shortz Sighting! Sorry for the short notice, but Will Shortz will be interviewed at 3:30 p.m. Eastern today on MSNBC about competitive crossword solving, because there’s not enough competition going on in sports today.

SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — An unusual looking mirror-symmetry grid, isn’t it? It turns out there are reasons for that, and when the hurly-burly’s done, hopefully you will see all the great things in this puzzle, too.

I was very excited when I cracked this grid. I recently went to see the actor Alan Cumming in a nearly one-man performance of “THE SCOTTISH PLAY” (Ssshh … don’t say “MACBETH” if you’re backstage at a performance of Shakespeare’s tragedy. It’s bad luck.) and was bowled over by his ability to play almost all the parts by himself. Not only that, but this adaptation of the play placed him in the psych ward of a hospital after having been brought in by the police for having committed a brutal crime. Very haunting!

Speaking of haunting, how about that weapon in the middle of this puzzle by Dick Shlakman (who appears to be making his debut) and Jeff Chen? You didn’t miss it, did you? Take your writing implement of choice and connect the circled letters, which just happen to spell out MACBETH (ssshh!).

Ah, there is a dagger you see before you, the handle toward your hand. Worry not that there appears to be BLOOD dripping from it at 100 Down. If you’d like to see the answer key that was made specially for this puzzle, you can click here to see it in all its gory, I mean glory.

And take a moment to enjoy the really delicious entries, some having to do with the play, some not. I loved MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS, KNOCK KNOCK WHO’S THERE, DURAN DURAN, ONE FELL SWOOP, A CHARMED LIFE, WHAT’S DONE IS DONE, BANDOLERO, TOODLE-OO, KAHUNA and, of course, THE SCOTTISH PLAY.

I get the feeling, although I can’t confirm it, that the cluing was made a bit easier today, but I’m not sure why that would be, since the trick to the puzzle is mainly visual. It doesn’t really matter; it’s a lovely puzzle with great fill, and I smiled all the way through it.

Let’s hear from Mr. Shlakman and Mr. Chen:

Constructor Notes

J.C.: Thus continues the saga of “JEFF VS. DAN on Jeff’s own puzzles.” My solving time: 6:39. You’ll find Dan’s time (and that of the other speedsters posted at Dan’s blog. Curious to see how badly he beat me this time. It’s been over 30 puzzles now, and I still haven’t won. Heck, sometimes I don’t even come within a factor of two! Very fun collaborating with Dick on his big debut. He came up with the idea and I helped him refine it. I actually didn’t do that much. The credit should go to him. It’s tough to come up with clever ideas for a New York Times Sunday puzzle. Ah, the gridwork. Not as much of a challenge as I’ve encountered in some other constructions, but a toughie nonetheless. There are only six themers, but incorporating the dagger with the MACBETH letters made it tricky, forcing us to deploy our black squares quicker than we had desired. This left big open spaces in the NW and NE, and without those cheater squares (the two stair patterns at the top of the grid), it looked pretty hopeless. We debated whether EXERCISERS was legitimate, eventually deciding it was KOSHER, and were glad that it allowed the snazzy BANDOLERO and LITERATI to work. The other tricky spot sort of sneaked up on us. Because of the word count limitations (140 max), we had to incorporate a few long across answers, IONE SKYE notably. It’s a nice entry in itself, but boy, did it cause problems. Because it crossed three theme answers, there weren’t many options there besides IONE SKYE, and once that was fixed into place, KIEL was the best we could do at that spot. Now, I’m a huge fan of James Bond villains and Jaws in particular, but even I don’t like having to remember who played him. And having OHO, OOH, OH I, UH OH … that’s my fault. Sometimes at a certain point (in this case, maybe 50 attempts), you’ve done your best. Ah, well, as with most constructions, there will be compromises. I had a great time working on this with Dick, and I welcome anyone who’s interested in collaborating (Read: allowing me to ride on your coattails as I politely shoot down all your ideas until something fun emerges) to contact me at jeffchen1972 (at) gmail.com. D.S.: If the byline for co-constructors was set in type reflecting the respective contributions of each, my name would be in 8-point pica type and Jeff’s in 20-point, BOLDED and italicized. I am very different from most who construct puzzles accepted by The New York Times. At age 74, words and wordplay continue to delight me, but trivia does not, for I will forget it 5 minutes after I learn it. I have already forgotten every movie star and character name in Star Wars, never saw a Hobbit movie, and know not of any pop music title, performer or album after the 1960s; I have often argued there was no pop music after the 60s. I do not attempt any crosswords or other puzzles except the Sunday New York Times and it takes me close to an entire day to get near finishing one. When I discover the theme and theme words, and other fun fill that is not a proper noun, I consider the puzzle successfully solved. Notwithstanding this lack of both crossword completion skill and practice, it has been a dream (or a bucket list item) to see my name attached to a Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle. (I think it is the same syndrome that causes me to enjoy writing poetry, but not reading it.) I had many theme ideas (none architectural) and no ability whatsoever to take the next step. One Sunday, in checking my many unfilled answers at Rex Parker’s blog, I saw a comment from Jeff volunteering to work with “noobies”. My initial response was to send Jeff an idea for a puzzle involving homophones and a lengthy list of potential theme answers. That effort ultimately led to the co-construction of a puzzle containing homophones as the theme answers, submitted to, and accepted by Will for a Wednesday publication, but it has not yet been published. (Would that constitute foreplay if this is my maiden appearance?) During the course of working with that puzzle, Jeff taught me the most basic of New York Times crossword construction requirements, to wit: that theme answers need to be internally very consistent and “tight” (a comment I have heard from Jeff as he has, with considerable grace, declined to co-author virtually every other idea I have submitted to him!), and that the fill must be neat and clean and interesting with as little reliance on “crosswordese” as possible. My original idea and theme word selections for this puzzle centered on well-known expressions first introduced into the English language by Shakespeare. Not “tight enough,” opined my new mentor. He suggested we try for such theme content from one play only. He also authored the idea of using Macbeth and working in, as the reveal clue, the reference to the superstition against mentioning the play’s name, (which was the subject of a marvelous Canadian television series called “Slings and Arrows”, season 2, also shown in the U.S. on Sundance). In our division of labor, we collaborated and contributed equally on the selection of the Macbeth quotes, Jeff did the grid and virtually all of the fill, and I took the lead in, and supplied much of the clues. Will, of course, had much to say about the clues. (I am reminded of Justice Jackson’s aphorism about the Supreme Court: “We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.”) Jeff and I are curious about whether the extent of the clue-editing is average, or more or less than average. Perhaps Will will enlighten us.

And when we all meet again, in thunder, lightning or in rain, it will be time for the Monday puzzle.
