Somewhere around the nexus of MTV, radio, the Internet and the late-night laser show at the Planetarium exists FlashRadio, which its marketers are calling a new concept in radio. FlashRadio (www.flashradio.com), which is scheduled to make its debut today, presents five channels of different music themes, including pop, alternative and urban. The added touch is that while the music plays, the monitor fills with a continuous animation show (the images are not tailored to the individual songs, but to the channel's ''mood'').

The station is the product of a joint effort between Sonicnet (www.sonicnet.com), the popular music entertainment site; Macromedia (www.macromedia.com), which makes animation software, and the Intel Corporation. Nicholas Butterworth, the 30-year-old president of Sonicnet, a division of TCI Music, conceded that there were already a lot of radio stations on the Internet. ''They have been great to listen to, but boring to watch,'' he added.

How much fun FlashRadio will be to watch may depend on the speed of your processor. Mr. Butterworth noted that a Pentium II processor was needed for optimal viewing. That is a vast minority of home computers.
