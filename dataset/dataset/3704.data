EARLIER this summer Carolyn Hack got the thrill of her life. Carolyn, a 15-year-old high-school student fromOverland Park, Mo., was in line to ride the roller coaster at an amusement park in Kansas City, Mo., when she and her friends saw the actor Leonardo DiCaprio emerge from one of the cars. After the requisite hysteria, Carolyn's response fit a modern teen-age template: she rode in the same car the actor had sat in; then she went home and wrote a detailed account of the experience for her Web site.

If every home will eventually have a home page, it seems that every fan will have the power to put up a fan site. And while it is common for celebrities to mount ''official'' sites, it is the renegade pages that generate lively, unadulterated discussions about the objects of their affection.

''The best fan sites allow people to share something they experience and enjoy,'' said Brian Bikowicz, whose on-line name is Megazone and who operates a page about the pop singer Ani DiFranco. ''They let people who enjoy the same thing establish a collective memory of fandom.''

Besides her own Web site, Carolyn manages an on-line service called DiCapring (www.sky.net/hack/ dicapring.htm), which links almost 660 DiCaprio-centric sites. The Web ring creates an on-line community of fan-oriented sites, pages that have little in common except that they satisfy the insatiable need to know everything about the celebrity or artist in question. Visitors to the sites can post rumors, exchange pictures, argue the quality of Mr. DiCaprio's work and generally wallow in the minutiae of the star's life.
