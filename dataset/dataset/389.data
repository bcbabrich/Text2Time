RIO DE JANEIRO — L.A.T.I., the Italian owned and operated air line which is the only trans-Atlantic link between the Rome-Berlin Axis and the Western Hemisphere, completed its first year of operations today [Dec. 23]. In spite of the war in Europe, it is still making weekly flights with land planes between Rome and Rio de Janeiro. It is an important line, for by it the Axis reaches South American countries and the United States without running the risk of confiscation or censorship at a British control station.

The New York Herald Tribune has been able to obtain precise information about the operation of L.A.T.I., especially in the months since Italy’s entrance into the war on June 10, when France was collapsing. Since that day there have been thirteen westbound flights on which the line has carried a total of nine passengers, five tons of mail and five and a half tons of cargo valued at $100,922.48. There have been only two disasters since the service was inaugurated. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Jan. 2, 1941
