It is a gift that people like Mrs. Jacobs and her husband, Gil, who has been going to the orchestra since 1954, when he was 10, are not prepared to give up. ''As a South African in a new South Africa, if you want something you have to fight,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''And if they take away our culture from us, we are destroyed, so we have to fight.''

Indeed, the evening seemed to redouble the resolve of many present to save the orchestra.

''We can't let this go,'' Robin Finlay, the principal trumpeter and an 11-year veteran of the orchestra, said moments after walking off the stage for what he hopes will not be the last time. ''It's too good to let go.'' The country's minister of arts, culture, science and technology, Dr. Ben Ngubane, is the man who has to make sure that none of those souls starve, that all of them are fed at least a morsel or two. And contrary to what some critics might argue, Dr. Ngubane said that he, too, wanted to see classical music thrive in South Africa.

But times have changed and so must the orchestras. ''Essentially, they must undergo very far-reaching transformation, which they haven't done by and large,'' he said in an interview.

For most of their lives, the country's principal orchestras, based in Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and until last week here, depended on the government for most of their money. The National Symphony received the bulk of its budget from the state-supported South African Broadcasting Corporation. For the other orchestras, opera houses and ballet theaters, there were the Performing Arts Councils, which controlled nearly 70 percent of the country's arts budget and existed essentially to support the artistic interests of the white minority.

With the end of apartheid and the establishment of majority rule, such largess soon became untenable. Long neglected, the artistic interests of the black majority finally would be supported. With little additional money available, however, it has meant radically reducing the allocations for historically white cultural interests, which means that today those Performing Arts Councils control just under a third of the country's total arts budget.

The change, Dr. Ngubane told Parliament last year in his budget speech, has allowed projects unthinkable not long ago to at least have a chance today, projects like the Soweto Community Dance project, the Hennie Joubert Piano Competition and the Madimba Institute of African Culture and Heritage.
