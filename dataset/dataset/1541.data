Berlin

I suppose should thank the Chambre Syndicale, the organizing body for French fashion, for creating a break between the men’s shows and haute couture. It gave me a good excuse to go to Berlin.

I’ve made three trips to the city in the last half dozen years, and each time I try to grasp more, see more. I am always on foot or on a bicycle. Yesterday’s walk was around Kreuzberg and then to Potsdamer Platz. Today I hoofed it to the Neues Museum and then around Mitte and finally, at close to 6 p.m., an Elizabeth Peyton show in a beautiful, broken-down ballroom. A friend of mine from Austin, Tex., an artist named Ali Fitzgerald, joined me. Ali has been living and working in Berlin for the last 18 months, so I was glad to have her perspective.

This isn’t really a fashion trip. In fact, one of the reasons I like Berlin is that you don’t feel the impulse to dress up or shop, which is certainly not how you feel in Paris or London. Berlin feels a little lazy and casual — it’s eating Turkish food on a sidewalk terrace in Kreuzberg and stopping for a beer later. The sense of history here is also extraordinary, so profound and immediate.

We were up for some bookstores, so Ali suggested a place she knew in Mitte. Yet when we arrived at 152 Brunnenstrasse, the shop had a new name since her last visit. Hannes Wanderer opened 25 Books, specializing in photography, at that address a little more than a year ago. Right away I loved the plainness of the store — the books he liked on a table, more on some shelves and another group of books and photo journals at the back. He was very informative; talkative, too. We must have chatted for an hour. He has a Web site (25books.de), and he explained that the name doesn’t mean anything special. He just liked the way it sounded. He also publishes books under the imprint Peperoni Books.

I bought two books: “Wunden,” a self-published collection of photographs by a young German named Gerald von Foris, which is an interesting assemblage of architecture, animals and nature; and a book of images of West Berlin by Hans W. Mende. Between the fall of 1978 and the spring of 1979, Mr. Mende took pictures in areas along the Berlin Wall. Potsdamer Platz was still largely open land then and there were still damaged buildings — and it was only 30 years ago. That’s when Hannes Wanderer arrived in Berlin. “It was as it was becoming history,” he said.
