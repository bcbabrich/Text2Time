One of New York's best-kept dance secrets is the Purchase Dance Corps. It is common knowledge that the dance division of the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., produces some of the best performers around, and that many of them may be seen without much trouble by dancegoers in Manhattan. But the students' annual spring concert, presented only in Westchester at the college's theater complex, is more difficult to get to. And that is a pity. The performances can be eye opening when they feature revivals of familiar dances. The dancers are skilled and fresh, and perform without a trace of affectation.

This year's program, which will be repeated Thursday through Sunday at the college's Performing Arts Center (735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase), opens with "Forest," an exquisite modern dance piece choreographed by Robert Cohan, the director of the London Contemporary Dance Theater and a former Martha Graham principal. Bodies move through dim light in soft-colored leotards. The eager attack is Graham. The look of limpid suspension is Merce Cunningham. The nine dancers bring a simplicity to the choreography that reveals but does not stress the dance's many small surprises.

Overall, "Forest" is a series of cross-stage progressions, with dancers peeling off or leaving, then returning for brief duets and solos that are a fluid part of the whole. Mr. Cohan's inventiveness is boundless and delicate, wearing thin only in the dance's last moments. One dancer neatly stops another's turns. A woman travels across the stage in prim little chaine turns and notices two fallen male bodies. She pauses to stare, her hand flies up to her cheek as if in wonderment, and she travels off again.

There are voluptuous oozes for a reappearing siren. Strange, sensuous lifts curl like plant tendrils into the air or down around the lifter's body. The dancers pass through one odd but beautiful shape or action after another. A storm comes, the dance quickens and hardens and bird and animal sounds are heard over wind, followed by rain. Every element of the dance contributes to its mood and grace, from Brian Hodgson's score to Norberto Chiesa's costumes and Mr. Cohan's lighting. And the dancers on Saturday night were exceptional, open and loose bodied but impeccably precise.
