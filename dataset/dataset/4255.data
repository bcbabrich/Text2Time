Under the Trading With the Enemy Act, it has been illegal since 1963 for any U.S. company to do business with Cuba. Yet Cargill Inc., a giant agricultural trader, is accused of arranging for the sale of Cuban sugar to Venezuela in 1988 through its Swiss subsidiary, Cargill International. But, as The Times's Dean Baquet reports, at only one point is Cargill vulnerable to U.S. laws -- the Swiss subsidiary obtained its dollar-denominated financing from the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, presumptively violating embargo laws.

This is the same Atlanta bank whose chief officer, Christopher Drogoul, was indicted in 1991 on charges of granting multi-billion dollar loans to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The Cuban sugar sale was cited in the Justice Department charges, and Cargill executives in Minnesota and Switzerland were named as co-conspirators but not indicted.

It stretches belief that the company's Geneva subsidiary acted primarily on its own, as Cargill's attorneys claim. Still, from what is known, this is less a scandal than a commentary on the difficulty of proving collusion in sanctions cases. Enforcement is especially difficult when an embargo is imposed by the United States alone, which it does against Cuba, Vietnam, Libya and North Korea. In a global economy, foreign subsidiaries of multinational companies are subject to laws of host countries, beyond the reach of the Justice Department or the U.S. Congress. This limitation is essential to the orderly functioning of a global economy. Imagine the indignation in America if foreign subsidiaries were ordered by another government to refuse all sales to Israel.

But the legal autonomy of foreign subsidiaries enormously complicates enforcement of any unilateral embargo. That applies doubly when other countries perceive U.S. trade restrictions as unreasonable or unfair. Cuba is a case in point. Evasions became so widespread that in 1992 Congress tightened existing sanctions and expressly barred foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-based corporations from doing business with the Castro regime. Though this has cut some trade, Britain, Canada and other major trading countries have protested the law's extraterritorial reach and decline to enforce it.
