A separate lawsuit was filed last year against Exxon Mobil by Riverkeeper, for violation of the federal environmental laws, and City Councilmen David Yassky of Brooklyn and Eric Gioia of Queens, who represent the communities along Newtown Creek, expect to join it. But Mr. Gioia said last week said he wanted more exploratory holes drilled on the Queens side of Newtown Creek to help determine if more homeowners should seek legal action.

"The toxins from this spill have had a half-century to seep under the creek, degrade our waterways, and ruin our land," Mr. Gioia said. "We need to do everything possible to ensure our residents are safe and sound from this looming environmental threat."

Brian Dunphy, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said in a statement that company officials are "disappointed in the legal actions that have been initiated against our remediation activities at our former Brooklyn refinery and terminal site. We believe the assertions made by Riverkeeper and others are unfounded."

Mr. Dunphy also said the company does not believe there are any "health or safety impacts" resulting from the spill, which the company believes is far enough underground that local residents and businesses are not affected.

Many Greenpoint residents, however, have mixed feelings about the lawsuits.

Some say they have little faith that yet more legal action -- Exxon Mobil has been under a self-initiated consent order with the state Department of Environmental Conservation since 1990 -- will have any effect, and state and local agencies have not intervened in the matter so far. Some are skeptical of the California-based Girardi & Keese, noting that the law firm is not local and questioning its motives. And others are concerned that the new lawsuit and its attendant publicity will sink home prices that have been rising rapidly during the last few years.

"I'm not convinced that it's the right thing to do," said Helen Wus, who lives over the spill but says she will not join the lawsuit. "What's going to happen, inevitably, is it's going to devalue our property. If I knew 20 years ago when I bought this house that there was so much oil under this house, I would not have bought it."

Not all Greenpoint residents are worried, however. Adam LaTempa, who lives on Apollo Street, said he was not aware of the lawsuit and did not think his neighbors were preoccupied with Riverkeeper's findings.
