ZIMMERMAN--Kenneth.Kenneth "Kenny" Zimmerman, son of Jerome and Renee Zimmerman, beloved Husband, Father, and Grandfather, passed away June 25, 2014, at his home in Edgewater, New Jersey. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Zimmerman attended Poly Prep High School and then graduated from The University of Miami in 1972. Shortly thereafter, he started Kenar Enterprises with Murray Levy. In the early 90's, Zimmerman was one of the first and one of the strongest leaders in philanthropic efforts in the Fashion Industry. He used his company's largest advertising vehicle, the billboard at One Times Square, under the Sony TV screen for 10 years. It was there that the world could see his provocative advertisements of global social issues, such as AIDS, Elisabeth Glaser's Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and Evelyn Lauder's Breast Cancer Research Foundation. His well-known supermodels, Linda Evangelista, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, and Claudia Schiffer were the cause of many traffic jams in Times Square. One of his most celebrated campaigns featured an advertisement shot in Sicily with Linda Evangelista and seven Sicilian women dressed in black; limited editions of the photograph were sold with proceeds going to an AIDS education group. The International Center for Photography included it as one of the '20 most important fashion photographs" ever. Kenar opened stores world-wide, but in 1994, the New York flagship on Madison Avenue opened to much fan-fare as Mrs. Evelyn Lauder, Mayor Giuliani, Elizabeth Hurley, Linda Evangelista, and Mr. Zimmerman cut the huge Pink Ribbon dedicating a portion of Kenar's sales that October for Breast Cancer Awareness month to BCRF. After selling the brand Kenar to the Pegasus Fund, Kenny purchased other brands that were in bankruptcy and rebuilt them. Some of these brands were Schrader, St. Gillian, A.J. Bari, Freeway, In Transit, and Hero Group (Black Tie by Oleg Cassini). In 1999, Kenny formed a new venture, Emma Black and Zola Evening, producing sportswear and evening wear for major department stores around the world. Never satisfied with all of his accomplishments, in 2003, Kenny developed Calvin Klein Outerwear, a newly acquired license by Calvin Klein Corporation. He was proud to be able to support many charities and causes. Another project dear to his heart was working with The Partnership for the Homeless, along with restaurants across the city helping to feed those less fortunate. He was on the Board of The Jack Martin Fund at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Board of Directors at the JCC on the Palisades. He was also on the Advisory Board of Babies Hospital at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Kenny's family was more important than any of his companies or positions. Arlene Zimmerman, his beloved wife of 42 years; his proud, loving children, Nicole, Zachary, and Ryan Zimmerman; his grandchildren, Ethan and Jordan Zimmerman; and his sister, Leslie Daspin, survive him. His eldest son Matthew predeceased him in 2012.
