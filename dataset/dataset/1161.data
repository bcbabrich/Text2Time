Errol Morris on photography.

This is the second in a three-part series.

And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save that he had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

— Revelation, XIII: 16,17.

THE NUMBER OF HIS NAME

“Have you ever seen Herman Melville’s passport?” This was a question from Judy Rascoe, a screenwriter and a well-read friend. I had to admit that I had not. I had not even thought about the question of whether Melville needed a passport. It had just never entered my head.

Several e-mails later Judy directed me to a Web site that provides 19th-century passports and passport applications. Included is a facsimile of Herman Melville’s passport application, dated Oct. 1, 1849. There is no photograph accompanying the application (even though daguerreotypes and tintypes had been around for nearly a decade). I was puzzled. How can a customs official or a border control agent know that the person standing before him is really Herman Melville and not someone else? Or am I missing the point? Perhaps the passport isn’t used for identification. Perhaps it is only a formality. More like a letter of introduction. But if proof of identity is of no importance, then why include personal details at all?

Melville writes in his application, “Included are the items of personal description which I trust will prove sufficient.”

Height – 5 ft. 10 1/8 [1]

Eyes – Blue

Hair – Dark Brown

Mouth – Medium

Nose – Medium Prominent

Complexion – Fair

Age – 30 years

Forehead – Medium

Chin – Ordinary

Face – Oval

National Archives and Records Administration

Were these self-reported measurements deemed sufficient? Today, they would be rejected out of hand.[2] Face — Oval? Chin — Ordinary? What does that tell us?

How were people able to “prove” their identity to others before the advent of photography and fingerprinting? Melville’s passport raises all kinds of questions. Did people accept his “identity” on trust? Were customs officials simply making do with written descriptions because nothing better was available?



There are problems with self-reporting. Are we the best judges of our own physical characteristics? If someone wanted to dissemble or hide from others his true identity, couldn’t he provide self-serving and misleading information? How do we make the measure of man more objective? How can it be standardized? And how can we be assured that we are providing a unique identification?

After all, even if Melville had recorded his height correctly, he was not the only man with an ordinary chin, oval-shaped face and blue eyes. He is the only man who wrote “Benito Cereno.” But it’s not clear how that detail would serve at a border crossing.

Alphonse Bertillon, who worked as a records clerk in a Parisian police department, had these issues in mind when he started assembling physical data about criminals. The Bertillon system, or bertillonage, as it became known (or anthropometry, or signaletics), consisted of a series of measurements that would uniquely identify an individual. Unlike Melville’s passport application, self-reporting was eliminated. Instead, a series of elaborate measurements were taken with specialized equipment used under standardized conditions. [3] Initially, it was believed that these measurements alone would be sufficient, but photographs were later added — a frontal portrait and profile. Surely, in conjunction with a photograph these measurements would be even more reliable.

The Bertillon system was introduced in 1882. Fingerprinting had been around in one form or another before, but by World War I, they were competing systems. Part of the difficulty of deciding on the efficacy of one over the other hinged on the retrieval of information. How do you classify fingerprints so that an unknown fingerprint can be efficiently matched with a card in a file? [4] The cataloging of fingerprints at first glance seems to be subjective. Exactly what counts as a match between two prints? The Bertillon system, in comparison, is straightforward. You have numerical data on a card, and you are able to catalog the data in a simple and straightforward manner.

And when photography became part of the Bertillon system, the card presented photographs alongside the “precise” Bertillon measurement of height, etc. Francis Galton, the father of eugenics and eventually a champion of fingerprinting, allowed himself to be memorialized on a Bertillon card with both a frontal photographic portrait and a profile. But the Bertillon measurements were never filled in.

UCL/Galton Collection

Photographs were used by the police as early as the 1840s. [5] [6] By midcentury, collections of photographs were assembled by various police departments in what became known as “rogues’ galleries.” [7]

“Professional Criminals of America,” written by Thomas Byrnes, inspector of police and chief of detectives in New York City, and published in 1886, is a perfect example of such a rogues’ gallery. It explains why photography is an indispensable aid in the unique identification of criminals. [8] To the trained observer, the photograph provides essential details. A criminal can try to disguise his appearance before the camera, but the photograph sees through all of that — to telling physical details and facial quirks that cannot be fully concealed. Byrnes compares these features to the mark of Cain. [9]

The very cleverest hands at preparing a false physiognomy for the camera have made their grimaces in vain. The sun has been too quick for them, and has imprisoned the lines of the profile and the features and caught the expression before it could be disguised. There is not a portrait here but has some marked characteristic by which you can identify the man who sat for it. That is what has to be studied in the Rogues’ Gallery — detail.

“They have made their grimaces in vain.” A photograph captures something unique about a person. Try as hard as they might, criminals cannot hide or disguise their identity. And if photographs alone provide unique identification, what about photography and bertillonage? Surely, that would be even better.

And then as the legend goes, on May 1, 1903, a young man named Will West was admitted to Fort Leavenworth prison on manslaughter charges. [10] A few days later he was brought into the office of the record clerk to be measured and photographed. The clerk thought that he recognized West, though West protested. In the best-known account of this story, published in 1918 by the forensics pioneers Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth, the following exchange is reported:

“You have been here before?” “No, sir,” answered West; but as the clerk was positive, he ran his measuring instruments over him, and from the Bertillon measurements thus obtained, went to the file, and returned with the card the measurements called for, properly filled out … and bearing the name, “William West.” This card was shown to the prisoner, who grinned in amazement, and said, “That’s my picture, but I don’t know where you got it, for I know I have never been here before.” The record clerk turned the card over, and read the particulars there given, including the statements that this man was already a prisoner at the same institution, having been committed to a life sentence on September 9, 1901, for the crime of murder. That is, the card found was that of a different man, still within the walls of that very prison, yet of the same name, the same facial expression, and practically the same Bertillon measurements as the newcomer! It then dawned on all present that there were two Will Wests, and that here was a case of the most remarkable resemblance of two unrelated persons on record; since neither the photographs or the Bertillon measurements were of any avail in establishing the identity of these two men. The clerk writes that, with their hats on, it is almost impossible to tell these two men apart. [11]

Bertillonage and photography had failed to adequately discriminate between the two Wests. Their names were similar — well, more than similar — isn’t “Will” an abbreviation of “William”? Their photographs and Bertillon measurements were identical. (Almost.) And they looked like the same person, or at worst, like identical twins. It became the stuff of legend. Everything about these two men matched, except, as the story goes, for the ink patterns left on paper when they were fingerprinted. Sure enough, despite the similarity of appearance, of names, and of their Bertillon measurements, the fingerprints of Will West and William West were completely different: an Inside Whorl of 11 ridges (Will) vs. an Invaded Loop with 18 ridges (William).

Many subsequent accounts attribute the rise of fingerprinting and the fall of Bertillon measurements to this confusion between one West and the other. But others suggest that the story is fable, not fact. [12]

I discussed the story of the Wests with Simon Cole, an associate professor of criminology at the University of California, Irvine. Cole is also the author of “Suspect Identities: A History of Fingerprinting and Criminal Identification” (Harvard University Press, 2002), the definitive work on the triumph of fingerprinting (or dactyloscopy) over bertillonage. Cole’s dissent from the etiological myth of “the two Will Wests” debunking bertillonage stems from his observation that the men were in fact distinguishable under the Bertillon system: the 7cm. difference in foot length is outside Bertillon’s maximum tolerable deviation for saying two sets of measurements derived from the same body.

SIMON COLE: The story of the two Wests is in all the accounts of the development of fingerprinting, including the F.B.I. tour and the F.B.I.’s little pamphlets on the history of identification. It is one of these myths that appear everywhere, every encyclopedia article, every standard history. And they all tell this same story that I trace back to Wilder and Wentworth.

ERROL MORRIS: Yes. But then I read that the two Wests — William and Will — were not influential in making the change from bertillonage to fingerprinting. In fact you make the point.

SIMON COLE: Right. It took another 20 years, but it has become part of the founding myth of fingerprinting for a reason. Here you have this case study in which these guys looked the same, their Bertillon measurements were the same, and fingerprints distinguished them.

ERROL MORRIS: Yes. It was a sales tool for the promotion of fingerprinting.

SIMON COLE: Yes. And then, the fact that they turned out to be African-Americans seems not entirely accidental. Wilder himself had perpetuated the idea in his own writings about who should be fingerprinted. It’s all Negroes and Chinese — essentially, immigrants and people who aren’t subject to anthropometry. So it is both a founding myth for fingerprinting and its implications for race, and that it somehow debunked bertillonage. [13]

ERROL MORRIS: So, wait a second. It is an origin myth for fingerprinting — how fingerprinting won out over anthropometry, but it was created 20 years after the fact?

SIMON COLE: I don’t have the smoking gun as to why it was created. But look at Wilder’s own history with this. Wilder starts out very skeptical of fingerprinting and claiming that anthropometry is the real scientific system. Fingerprinting is an expedient if you’re doing something considered to be low-level, like identifying Chinese immigrants. But if you’re identifying white criminals in New York, you need the better system, which is anthropometry. And over the course of 20 years, he reverses himself on that position. He becomes converted to fingerprinting.

ERROL MORRIS: Why?

SIMON COLE: Probably cost reasons. Fingerprinting puts the cost on the back end. It’s cheap to take fingerprints, and a little bit more expensive to classify them, whereas bertillonage is just the opposite. It’s expensive to take the measurements, because you have to train people and keep them disciplined and consistent, and working efficiently to take the measurements. And then, once you’ve got them, the costs go down. Also, familiarity. Police agencies became more familiar with it. And, as police agencies started using it, it seemed to function O.K. The sense of it as less efficient and promising than bertillonage wore off.

ERROL MORRIS: But was photography ever considered? Or is this just something that had a kind of brief vogue, mid-19th century?

SIMON COLE: Yeah. Around 1900-02, when people like Wilder are saying “use anthropometry,” and fingerprinting is just coming over from Europe; and the police chief of San Francisco, F.H. DePue, says, “No, no, use photographs.” There were systems floating around, where you would impose a grid over the face, and you would somehow quantify the information in the photograph. The reason not to use photographs was “O.K., there’s lots of information there. But how do I classify it? How do I put it in order?” Bertillon talks about: “O.K., you have a pile of photographs. That’s nice. Now what do you do with them?” What order do you put them in, so you know how to retrieve the correct photograph when you’re trying to match it to a face?

ERROL MORRIS: Right.

SIMON COLE: And, although I don’t have much sense as to how these things were supposed to work, it’s clear that people were thinking about a system of grids over the face. You would come up with some kind of indexing. An indexing system is probably the best thing to call it, rather than a classification system. What you want is some way of finding a photograph of a face, if that face should appear again. There’s a moment when they’re proposing fingerprinting Chinese immigrants in the 1880s. And they write to the Immigration Bureau in Washington, D.C., and they say photography is fine. So there is this moment where photography is seen as a truer and more useful record than a fingerprint. And even as late as 1902, you have DePue saying that as well. But the real problem was the indexing system, and it is still the problem with facial recognition systems as an identification tool. There are a lot of advantages to facial recognition because you can do it surreptitiously, and people don’t have to cooperate. But the face becomes a difficult thing to classify and convert into quantitative information. You end up just measuring the distances between features, and it’s just not the most discriminating kind of measurement, compared with irises or fingerprints or DNA.

The F.B.I. history of identification (as quoted by Simon Cole) concludes:

It would be hard to conceive a more nearly perfect case for refuting the claims of rival systems of identification. Although the two Wests denied being related, there was a facial resemblance like that of twin brothers. The formulas derived from their Bertillon measurements were nearly identical — and, finally, there was the crowning coincidence of the similarity of names. The fallibility of three systems of personal identification — names, photographs and Bertillon measurements — were demonstrated by this one case. On the other hand, the value of fingerprints as a positive means of identifying people was dramatically shown. [14]

The story of the two Wests may not have been the deciding factor in the ascendancy of fingerprints, but it showed how fingerprinting could provide a more effective solution to the problem of unique identification. [15]

Names, photographs and Bertillon measurements. Bertillon measurements are a series of descriptions (or properties), much like the descriptions that accompany Melville’s passport application in 1849. Admittedly, they are not self-reported, but they seem contingent, variable. Isn’t there such a thing as a swollen foot, or a goiter, or some other physical malady that changes the circumference of a neck or an instep? And what assurance do we have that we’ve identified only one, unique individual — the Will/William West problem? What are we grabbing ahold of with these descriptions?

Photographs seem to have similar problems. A photograph may not resemble a person immediately after it’s taken, let alone years after the fact, even though it is still a photograph of that person. Wilder and Wentworth supply just such an example.

Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth, “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals, Living or Dead.” Boston: Gorham, 1918, 37.

The photograph on the left was taken of Frank Murray in Toronto in November 1908; the photograph on the right was taken of Frank Murray in Old Town, Me., in December 1909. Roughly a year apart. The prints of the left middle finger were taken at the same times as the photographs. It is still Frank Murray (the same man) over a year later, although his appearance is conspicuously different. [16] Again, we are left with several questions: [17]

1. If we are in possession of a photograph of a man, how do we know that a man appearing before us in the flesh is the man in that photograph? (How do we “attach” a photograph to the person who has been photographed?) [18]

2. How do we know the man in the photograph is Frank Murray? (How do we “attach” a name to a person in a photograph?)

3. Does a photograph uniquely identify an individual, e.g., Frank Murray? And if a photograph doesn’t uniquely identify an individual, then what does? Fingerprints?

Wilder and Wentworth conclude with a series of arguments against “sight recognition.”

The extraordinary resemblance between two individuals; second, the great amount of change in appearance of which a single individual is capable; third, the known unreliability of eyes, memory, and judgment under the influence of excitement, fear, or other mental emotion. … The outcome of the inquiry is plainly and irrefutably this: Sight Recognition is not Identification.

Their conclusion: only fingerprinting is reliable. Wilder and Wentworth’s book ends with a quote from Bertillon,

To fix the human personality, to give to each human being a definite individuality, durable, unchangeable, always recognizable and easily demonstrable; such seems the most comprehensible object of the new method. [19]

Sir Francis Galton’s classic work on fingerprinting, “Finger Prints,” first appeared in 1892. “Let no one despise the ridges on account of their smallness, for they are in some respects the most important of all anthropological data. We shall see that they form patterns, considerable in size and of a curious variety of shape, whose boundaries can be firmly outlined, and which are little worlds in themselves.”

Francis Galton, “Finger Prints.” New York: MacMillan and Co., 1892, 113.

Galton showed that these “little worlds” retain their character through a person’s life. And he clearly shows how even a child’s fingerprints “retain their peculiarities” from two years to 15 years old. As Galton writes, “[Fingerprints] have the unique merit of retaining all their peculiarities unchanged throughout life, and afford in consequence an incomparably surer criterion of identity than any other bodily feature.”

Galton was so enamored of ridges and unique identification that he felt it necessary to offer an emendation to the biblical story of Jezebel, wife of Ahab, who turns him against the Hebrew god, Yahweh, and toward the worship of the false Phoenician god, Baal. “We read of the dead body of Jezebel being devoured by the dogs [in] Jezreel, so that no man might say, ‘This is Jezebel,’ and that the dogs left only her skull, the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet; but the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet are the very remains by which a corpse might be surely identified, if impressions of them, made during life, were available.” Francis Galton, “Finger Prints,” 113. In the biblical account, God wants to insure that “no man” can identify Jezebel, although he may be possibly misinformed about the utility of palm prints and sole impressions in post-mortem identifications. Gustave Doré illustrated the scene.

Mark Twain was clearly aware of Galton’s landmark work, and in “Pudd’nhead Wilson” — which appeared just a couple of years later, in 1894 — he used these “little worlds in themselves” to create a story about race, appearance and identity with issues of nature and nurture liberally thrown in. [20]

Twain’s story starts with two babies who look more or less alike, although they are unrelated. However, Tom (Thomas á Beckett Driscoll) is the son of a wealthy white businessman; Chambers (Valet de Chambre), the son of a slave, although he is only one-thirty-second black.

To all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody, but the one-sixteenth of her that was black outvoted the other 15 parts and made her a Negro. She was a slave, and salable as such. Her child was 31 parts white, and he, too, was a slave, and by a fiction of law and custom a Negro. He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white comrade, and even the father of the white child was unable to tell the children apart. [21]

Roxy worries that her son will be sold down the river — a fate worse than death — and so she seizes on a plan to switch the two babies. Chambers will become Tom, and Tom will become Chambers — or at least their names, if not their identities, will be switched. The lawyer and the village eccentric — Pudd’nhead Wilson himself — has the habit of “collecting” fingerprints and has taken the fingerprints of Chambers and Tom before and after the switch. Still, everyone remains blissfully ignorant of Roxy’s plan until the murder of Tom’s uncle. Here is Pudd’nhead’s presentation, one of the great fictional perorations to a jury. [22]

“Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave certain physical marks which do not change their character, and by which he can always be identified — and that without shade of doubt or question. These marks are his signature, his physiological autograph, so to speak, and this autograph cannot be counterfeited, nor can he disguise it or hide it away, nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of time. This signature is not his face — age can change that beyond recognition; it is not his hair, for that can fall out; it is not his height, for duplicates of that exist; it is not his form, for duplicates of that exist also, whereas this signature is each man’s very own — there is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe! […] “This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with which Nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet. If you will look at the balls of your fingers — that have very sharp eyesight — you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close together, like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps, and that they form various clearly defined patterns, such as arches, circles, long curves, whorls, etc., and that these patterns differ on the different fingers. […] “Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were changed in the cradle […] “A was put into B’s cradle in the nursery; B was transferred to the kitchen and became a Negro and a slave [Sensation — confusion of angry ejaculations] — but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you white and free! [Burst of applause, checked by the officers.] From seven months onward until now, A has still been a usurper, and in my finger record he bears B’s name. Here is his pantograph at the age of twelve. Compare it with the assassin’s signature upon the knife handle. Do they tally?” The foreman answered: “TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL!” Wilson said, solemnly: “The murderer of your friend and mine — York Driscoll of the generous hand and the kindly spirit — sits in among you. “Valet de Chambre, Negro and slave — falsely called Thomas á Becket Driscoll — make upon the window the fingerprints that will hang you!”

Ah, but Twain has more in store for the reader. Chambers is sentenced to life in prison. But this ending is clearly not despairing enough for Twain. Something even more terrible, even more horrible, even more ironic is required. And so, despite the endless twists and turns of the story, Roxy’s greatest fear comes true. Tom’s estate is insolvent. The creditors are anxious and angry. If Chambers goes to prison for life, they get nothing. However, if he is sold as chattel down the river, the estate can recover some money. The last lines of “Pudd’nhead Wilson” must have given Twain enormous pleasure:

Everybody granted that if “Tom” [Chambers] were white and free it would be unquestionably right to punish him — it would be no loss to anybody; but to shut up a valuable slave for life — that was quite another matter. As soon as the Governor understood the case, he pardoned Tom at once, and the creditors sold him down the river. FINIS

Nature and nurture seem complicit. And neither seem to matter much. Chambers is a bad guy, and his bad genes (based on race or otherwise) will out. Tom, deprived of the education which was presumably his due, is left in “a most embarrassing situation.” No reading, no writing, no manners. Nothing good can come of any of it. But, as they say in the late-night infomercials, “That’s not all.” A truly miserable end is guaranteed. Fate intervenes to insure the worst of outcomes.

Why imprison Chambers? The problem of what to do with him is nothing more than the problem of what to do with “erroneous inventory.” He is nothing more than chattel and hence, should be sold down the river. His “identity” is revealed to us — the readers of Twain’s novel — through his fingerprints. But there are deep rumblings of unseen machinery that dictate the outcome. Indeed, no amount of dissembling can hide his identity from the end he’s destined to meet.

It is the appointment in Samarra — the predestined end. But there is a better literary reference than John O’Hara. It is James M. Cain, the author of a story about a man guilty of murder who is executed for a crime he didn’t commit. Fate hooks onto us and drags us unceremoniously to some predetermined end.

Cain and Twain. It’s the belief that the postman always rings twice. [23]

It may all go back to this question of what makes us unique? What uniquely identifies us? What tells us that Chambers is Chambers, and Tom is Tom. We assume that we are unique. I am myself and no one else. But can I prove it? To myself or anyone else? What if fingerprinting fails to provide unique identification? Tom has been disambiguated from Chambers in Twain’s novel, but recent evidence suggests that fingerprints may not be unique. Even though identical twins have different fingerprints, given a sample of 100,000 or 1,000,000 or 1,000,000,000, are there no two people with the same prints? Recent studies suggest that fingerprinting may be less unique than we might think.

We might think of fate as proof that God had uniquely identified us for his own mischievous purposes. Even if we cannot identify Jezebel, God must know who she is. Isn’t he omniscient? Doesn’t he know when the sparrow falls? Doesn’t he know Tom is Tom, Chambers is Chambers, and that Roxy has committed a sin for which she, too, must be punished.

Does God (or fate) see beyond our physical characteristics to something deeper — to something beyond a fingerprint? To our essence? To what makes us unique? Not just who we are, but how we have become who we are? And what we will become? Leibniz tried to deal with this very question with his idea that the world is a skein of interlocking, interdependent pieces. Everything determined in advance. Leibniz’s God knows everything in advance and has made a decision about what we will experience, what will happen to us, what we deserve. We evade nothing; it is guaranteed that we will get our just deserts.

[1] There is an account of Melville’s height in the recent and massive biography by Hershel Parker, “Melville, vol. I. 1819-1851,” Johns Hopkins, 2005. As we have seen, Melville’s 1849 passport application listed his height as 5’ 10 1/8″. In 1856, in preparation for another voyage, he applied for a new passport and sent in a new set of measurements; in the intervening seven years, he had apparently shrunk. Parker tells the story: “Doing as he was told, Melville filled in the printed form and returned it for the State Department files. He had written carefully, in his best hand, but when he finished he folded it over before all the ink had dried, thereby creating a small smudge. He was 37 years old. He had listed his height as five feet eight and some fraction of an inch, but the smudge obliterated whatever fraction he had put down…In the actual passport Melville put his height at 5’ 8 3/4″, presumably what he wrote on the State Department copy where the fraction was smudged.” [pp. 292-293]

Curiously, the differing heights Melville listed the 1849 and 1856 applications both diverged from an earlier record of Melville’s stature. Again, Parker: “The earliest record of his mature height, at almost twenty, is in the crew list of the St. Lawrence, which he signed on June 3, 1839. There he gave his height as 5’ 8 1/2″. The height Melville listed on his passport in 1849 (5’ 10 1/8″) is curious on two grounds. First, the difference between 8 1/2 and 10 1/8 is unusual, since it is somewhat infrequent for a man to grow 1 5/8 inches after the age of twenty. Second, while a man will say he is 5’ 10 1/2″, or even 5’ 10 1/4″, a man will not ordinarily give his height in eighths of an inch. … As evident from the personal descriptions in the crew list of the Acushnet, for instance, it was common to measure by the quarter inch, but not a smaller unit. Melville’s hyperprecision in this matter is poignant in retrospect because it magnifies the discrepancy between how tall he said he was in 1849 and how short he said he was in 1856. If it is unusual for a man to grow 1 5/8 inches between the ages of twenty and thirty, it is still more unusual for a man to shrink 1 3/8 inches between the ages of thirty and thirty-seven. The height Melville gave in 1856 may be his honest acknowledgment that sciatica and other physical ailments of the past several years had literally reduced his stature – an example of the same honesty that had earlier led him to acknowledge procrastination to be a “sad failing.” [p. 293] I have a slight problem with Parker’s account. It suggests that these different recorded heights are accurate – and that Melville might have actually grown and then shrunk some 1 1/2”. Nowhere does Parker suggest that Melville may have reported his height incorrectly or perhaps was embarrassed by his actual height and sought to exaggerate it or minimize it. (Could the 1/8” detail – which as Parker admits is “unusual” – be motivated by Melville’s awareness that he was exaggerating his height, and therefore, thought to bolster the credibility of his claim by giving some absurdly precise measurement?)

Graphic by Daniel Mooney

It is possible that his first successful efforts at writing literally increased Melville’s physical stature, and then the effort of writing “Moby-Dick,” “Bartleby” and “Benito Cereno” — three of the greatest works in American literature — caused him to fold in on himself by nearly an inch and a half. A more plausible explanation, however, is that the self-reporting of personal details is not entirely reliable.

[2] Melville would not be allowed to take the SAT. Collegeboard.com makes a point of including in their list of unacceptable ID at testing sites, “Written physical description of the student (without photo), even if written on school stationery and signed by a counselor or principal.”

[3] The following photographs are from an extensive collection at the Library of Congress. They show bertillonage at the New York City Police Department, ca. 1908-9.

[4] “Bertillon did not believe in the possibility of the practical use of finger prints, because of the great difficulty of finding a means of classifying a large collection of them… He says expressly ‘Unfortunately, it is quite undeniable, notwithstanding the indefatigable researches of Mr. Francis Galton in England, that these designs do not present in themselves elements of variability sufficiently striking to serve as a basis in a collection of many hundreds of thousands of cases.’” Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth, “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead,” 1918.

[6] In his book “La Photographie Judiciarie,” [R.A. Reiss, La Photographie Judicaire, Charles Mendel Publisher, Paris, France, 1903).] Reiss mentions an article in the Sept. 10, 1854, issue

of the Journal des Tribenaux, written by Pellis, a Swiss lawyer. Pellis tells the following story:

“We still remember the newspaper reports on the many thefts in churches and private residences that occurred in the last year. Because of the curious circumstances surrounding these thefts, one was led to believe that a clever and important gang was involved. The startling thing was that no traces were ever found after any of the crimes had been committed. The thieves disappeared into thin air, none of the stolen objects turned up, and no strangers were noticed. It became obvious that many accomplices had to be involved, that fast means of transportation were available and that the goods were disposed of at faraway places. Several men were finally picked up and brought before the Justice of the Peace in Lausanne. Among the suspects, there was a mysterious person whose name and antecedents were unknown and against whom it was very difficult to find anything but vague suspicions, because he had succeeded in keeping out of the spotlight. The Justice had a portrait taken of the prisoner, who was suspected to be dangerous. This was done by the daguerreotype process. He sent copies of it to the police of all the Swiss cantons and to law enforcement agencies in the neighboring countries. Not much success was expected from this novel attempt, but finally news came in from the Grand Duchy of Baden that the suspect had been recognized in the village where he had lived. The villagers furnished the suspect’s name and details on his tumultuous youth. The investigation was continued, and wardens of the many prisons where the suspect should have been detained were interviewed. He was recognized everywhere, and all called him very sly. Confronted with the depositions and the evidence, the suspect did not resist long and made important confessions.”

[9] From the King James version (as elsewhere): “And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.” (Gen. 4:15) Although no one knows what the mark of Cain was or even if it was really a mark, at least one commentator, Rabbi Michael Berg, has suggested that it was the letter “waw” or “vav.” One of the many ironies of the story is that in Genesis the mark, given by God to protect Cain, marked him for persecution.

[10] The first account of this story comes from the landmark study of fingerprinting vs. bertillonage, “Personal Identification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead,” by Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth, published in 1918.

[11] Wilder and Wentworth, “Personal Indentification: Methods for the Identification of Individuals Living or Dead” (1918), pp. 31-33. It is unclear whether the story of the two Wests was responsible for the eventual failure of bertillonage and for the ascendancy of fingerprinting. It might have been a cautionary tale created (or emphasized) ex post facto as a way of highlighting the deficiencies of bertillonage.

[12] A recent discussion of the story of the two Wests can be found online. Robert D. Olsen Sr., “A Fingerprint Fable: The Will and William West Case”: “A search of the literature on fingerprint identification reveals that the alleged Will and William West case was not reported in print until Wilder and Wentworth’s account in 1918 (26). Please note that of the 26 books and articles listed in the bibliography, 18 were published prior to the release of Wilder and Wentworth’s book and none of the 18 mention the West case. Of particular note is that two of the items listed in the bibliography were by the records clerk who took the Bertillon measurements and the fingerprints of Will and William West, but who never mentions the incident. One is immediately struck with the thought that a pioneer in the establishment of fingerprint identification never attached much significance to a case in which he played a very important role. Perhaps the case was not as important as we have been led to believe?” from

//www.scafo.org/library/110105.html (This story appeared in the November 1987, Vol. 37, No. 11 issue of Identification News, which was the next to the last issue prior to changing publication format and becoming the Journal of Forensic Identification.) It is interesting that Bertillon measurements were discredited but photography and the use of proper names for identification survived.

[13] In “Personal Identification,” Wilder had written, “Chinese are proverbially difficult of identification by the ordinary facial recognition. … The same is true of Negroes, and all peoples of a race unlike that of the examiner, where the racial characters stand out so sharply as to obscure the finer details upon which recognition largely depends.” From Simon Cole, “Suspect Identities,” p. 144.

[14] Simon Cole, “Suspect Identities” (Harvard University Press, 2002).

[15] Recent work by Simon Cole and others has shown that fingerprinting may be less reliable than thought. And the claim that fingerprints are unique has not been scientifically tested.

[16] I myself was confused by the bowler.

[17] Galton asks slightly different questions: “For most criminal investigations, and for some other purposes also, the question is not … ‘Is A the same person, or a different person from B?’ but the much more difficult problem of ‘Who is this unknown person X?’” Francis Galton, “Finger Prints,” p. 154. Sharrona Pearl (in “About Faces: Physiognomy in Nineteenth-Century Britain.” Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press) makes an additional point. Galton’s identification was prosecutorial. Pearl writes: “For Galton, the primary use of somatic identification was to prosecute the guilty rather than to exonerate the innocent. In an inversion of Eastlake’s argument (discussed in Chapter 1) that physiognomy protected unfairly targeted strangers, Galton argued that ‘in civilized lands and in peaceable times, the chief use of a sure means of identification is to benefit society by deflecting rogues, rather than to establish the identity of men who are honest. Is this criminal an old offender? Is this new recruit a deserter? Is this professed pensioned personating a man who is dead? Is this upstart claimant to property the true heir, who was believed to have died in foreign lands?’” (206).

[18] The attentive reader will remember that that same verb (“attach”) was used by J.S. Mill in respect to proper names and the things they name in Part 1 of this essay.

[19] There are two issues here: universal identification – uniquely picking out an individual from a crowd; and fixing the human personality – determining just what it is that makes a person unique. Perhaps in the same sense that Fox Talbot, one of the inventors of photography, described the process of photography as “fixing the shadows.”

[20] There have been endless debates about the literary merit of “Pudd’nhead Wilson.” Even Hershel Parker, Melville’s biographer mentioned above, has weighed in on this issue. In an article, “Mark Twain and Pudd’nhead Wilson: A House Divided” (Novel: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 16, No. 1, autumn 1982), George Toles writes: “The most provocative recent criticism of Mark Twain’s Pudd’nhead Wilson … urges us to dismiss the novel as a hopeless botch, laughably unworthy of Leslie Fiedler’s long-ago claim that it is one of the most extraordinary books in American literature. Hershel Parker, the editor of the Iowa-California edition of the novel, has judged the work to be flawed throughout by compromises and ‘unreconciled contradictions,’ not the least of which are to be found in its ‘gaudy’ barnburner ending. To talk about Mark Twain’s intentions in regard to ‘Pudd’nhead Wilson,’ Parker maintains, ‘is to risk absurdity at every word.’” As much as I hate to join a fractious literary dispute, Parker is even more wrong in his denunciation of Twain’s work than in his assessment of the underlying reasons for Melville’s “change” in height.

[21] Twain, “Puddn’head Wilson,” Chapter II. One has to pay homage to the sheer perversity of Twain’s language. Roxy is a slave and hence disenfranchised. Nevertheless, one-sixteenth of her is able “to outvote” the other fifteen-sixteenths of her and to effectively disallow the possibility of her voting in an election or even being a citizen in the antebellum South, even though she would never be allowed to vote anyway.

[22] O.K. I should provide a spoiler alert. For all those fearful that hearing what happens at the end of “Pudd’nhead Wilson” will undermine the enjoyment of reading it, I suggest you abandon this essay immediately. My own two cents’ worth of opinion. I like to know endings in advance. It means I can concentrate on something more interesting than plot.

[23] Alas, these associations are everywhere. The protagonist of “The Postman Always Rings Twice” is named Chambers, the same as in “Pudd’nhead Wilson.” Although Cain professed to have no idea about the meaning of “the postman” in his title, I believe he is being unnecessarily difficult. Who could the postman be — other than Death?
