To the Editor:

In ''Why Won't Mandela Renounce Violence?'' (Op-Ed, June 21), David G. Sanders attempts to criticize Nelson Mandela's position to liberate black South Africans. He fails to recognize that his forefathers were responsible for an extremely violent overthrow of their British oppressors in 1776.

Furthermore, the United States wholeheartedly praised Romania's violent removal of Nicolae Ceausescu. The United States was also involved in militarily deposing Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, an action in which human life was lost. There was only praise for those actions.

I am sure Mr. Sanders has not been violently beaten, like many black South Africans, just for making a statement. His civil rights are not abused daily, and he has not spent the last 27 years in prison. It seems Mr. Sanders's knowledge in this area lacks insight.
