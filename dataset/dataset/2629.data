"He was much less uptight as a Democrat," Alexandra remarked.

In fact, he is still a registered Democrat, and Mr. Silver told his convention audience that he has not disavowed the left's social agenda. But at the moment he represents a particular slice of the American political spectrum: voters who put national security before ideology and want to keep President Bush's hand on the nation's rudder.

"I'm a 9/11 Republican," he said. "If we don't get this right, all the other things don't matter worth a hill of beans. I'll live to fight another day on health care, environmental concerns and sensible gun legislation. But this is such a predominant issue that it towers above all others, and I'm not certain both parties are capable of handling it the right way."

Mr. Silver said he admired Senator Kerry, whom he described as honorable, but added he did not think the candidate represents the rank and file of the Democratic Party, most of whom, he said, "I think are Howard Dean-Kucinich-Sharpton-Michael Moore people," the kind of people "who like the projection of American force for humanitarian reasons, so they'll support Clinton's intervention in Bosnia, but they don't like it in support of our own defense."

In response to Mr. Hume and to others, Mr. Silver said he had no evidence that his views had cost him any work. He has just finished filming a "Law & Order" episode, and he's revisiting a one-man stage show, based on the life of the rock 'n' roll impresario Bill Graham, that he worked on in the late 1990's.

But socially, he said, he has felt ostracized in Hollywood, reopening a chasm created when he supported Rudolph W. Giuliani, whom he describes as a friend, in his campaigns for mayor of New York.

"I just don't get invited to the same dinner parties I used to like to go to," Mr. Silver said. "And when I do get invited, there's no engagement. It's 'Ron, you're too smart for this,' 'Ron, you must be kidding,' 'Ron can we not talk about the war and have a nice dinner party?' And then they talk about it, but everybody has the same opinion.

"I'm getting friendly with the Gatlin brothers, what can I tell you?"

On Monday there was no such social disdain, but there was some surprise.
