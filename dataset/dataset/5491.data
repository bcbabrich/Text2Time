TAKING THE PULSE, RAN-dom-testing the product, sampling for pollutants -you pick the metaphor, but occasionally it's amusing to look at the Top 10 singles and see how American popular music is doing.

There are those who question the accuracy of the various charts - not so much the honesty of the compilers as the supposed manipulations of the record business and other interested parties. Of course, a vigorously marketed record is likely to sell better than an unpromoted one on a minor independent label - but that's capitalism, not corruption. I tend to believe the charts, at least in rough outline. And the most believable of all remain Billboard's - the oldest and most elaborately researched.

The chart used here is Billboard's ''Hot 100 Singles'' for the week ending Oct. 31. First, let's march upward through the numbers, just like on a radio countdown program. An asterisk after a number signifies especially brisk sales and, presumably, upward momentum.

10.* Bruce Springsteen: ''Brilliant Disguise.'' Far and away the most adult song on this chart, a compelling ballad with an outwardly engaging, inwardly complex and even tortured meditation on the difficulties of love. Proof not only that rock musicians can match the songwriting skills of Tin Pan Alley masters, but that vernacular music, employing simple musical means, can approach the depth of feeling of the art-song tradition.
