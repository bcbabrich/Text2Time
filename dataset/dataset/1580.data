The second week of the fall television season brought two casualties: Fox’s “Lone Star” and ABC’s “My Generation.”

ABC said Friday night that it was canceling “My Generation,” a documentary-style drama about young people 10 years out of high school. The show had drawn a meager 3.9 million viewers to its second episode on Thursday.

The network did not immediately announce how it would fill the Thursday at 8 p.m. time slot.

“My Generation” was the second show to be axed this week. Fox yanked “Lone Star” from its fall schedule on Tuesday, one day after its second episode drew a paltry 3.2 million viewers. Last week the creator of “Lone Star” published a colorful appeal for more viewers, to no avail.
