‘Pip’s Island’

If your children have ever wondered what it might be like to step out of one of the gondolas during a theme park ride and interact with all the surrounding animatronic creatures, now’s their chance.

It’s called “Pip’s Island,” a show that is as much a technological extravaganza as it is a theatrical experience — sometimes more so.

Developed by Rami Ajami and Rania Ajami, a brother-and-sister team, and the production’s creative director, Walter Krudop, the show takes groups of about 50 through a dozen environments in which the children attending help act out the story. The object? To save this magical isle from the villainous Joules Volter, who wants to wrest all its energy from the realm’s benevolent guardian, Amperes Wattson.
