The percentage of competitive bids have averaged only 20 percent of the total in 1991, 1992 and the first three quarters of this year. And the percentage has been declining, from 23.9 percent in 1991 to 18.6 percent for the first nine months of this year. In the third quarter, the percentage of competitive bids was down to 18.3 percent.

But the costs of being first in the rankings is something Merrill might be thinking about after the California bid. While a rally in the market could turn the numbers upside down and make Merrill's original aggressive bid look good, as of yesterday it had not.

The 30-year bonds that were priced to yield 5.24 percent at the sale on Tuesday were trading at around 5.35 percent yesterday in the secondary market, according to several traders. Bonds with maturities of 16 years and less that had not yet been sold were being offered at yields 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over their original yields. This means a sharp drop in prices, which move in the opposite direction.

"They came too high," said a member of the syndicate that Merrill Lynch led. In market jargon, "high" means the bid, made in interest rates, was too low.

This member of the syndicate suggested that winning has become too important for some of the big firms. "They are so intent on winning that they bid it too aggressively," he said, speaking on the condition that he not be named. "It looks like the account," he added, referring to all the firms in the syndicate, "is going to lose a lot of money unless the market turns around." Treasury Market

The Treasury market went through another volatile day of trading yesterday, as it got a dose of economic data that was a little more optimistic than some investors liked.

Since one of the foundations of the recent rally has been sluggish economic growth that can neutralize any inflation worries, signs of even a modest pickup can be disturbing when interest rates are already so low.
