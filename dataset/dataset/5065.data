A man who was being guarded by a police officer when the officer was murdered testified yesterday that he had seen two of the four men accused in the killing fleeing the murder scene in Queens.

The witness, a former homeowner in South Jamaica who uses the single name Arjune, appeared at an evidentiary hearing in State Supreme Court. He is expected to be a major witness at the first of two trials scheduled in the case. Jury selection for the first trial began Monday.

The officer, Edward Byrne, a 22-year-old rookie, was shot to death while guarding Mr. Arjune's house about 3:30 A.M. on Feb. 26. Three months earlier, Mr. Arjune's house had been firebombed after he had reported drug dealings outside his property. Mr. Arjune, 46, has since been relocated.

Until he testified yesterday - at a hearing to determine the validity of the procedures through which he had identified one of the defendants, Scott Cobb, 25 - it was not known how much of the crime he saw. He said that after being awakened by the shots and looking out the window, he saw Mr. Cobb behind the wheel of the getaway car and another defendant, Todd Scott, 20, standing near the car.
