Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Speculate on a student’s right to refuse to participate in an animal dissection.

2. Examine the legal arguments that Steven Wise uses in animal rights cases by reading and discussing “Courtroom Champion For 4-Legged Creatures.”

3. Research different perspectives and laws that pertain to a hypothetical animal rights case.

4. Synthesize their understanding of the legal issues surrounding animal rights cases by presenting their arguments at a hypothetical hearing and by writing a ruling on the case.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “Courtroom Champion For 4-Legged Creatures” (one per student)

-six slips of paper or index cards, each containing a description of a perspective or law that would pertain to the hypothetical animal rights case [the biology professor who insists on having students dissect healthy animals in class; a group that is familiar with the anti-cruelty statutes in the area (to view the applicable anti-cruelty statutes in your area, visit a Rutgers University School of Law’s Web site (//www.animal.law.org/statutes/index.html); a group that will explore the “liberty and equality” arguments that Wise summarized in the Times article; a group that will research the student’s right to act as a conscientious objector; a group to research the federal Animal Welfare Act (to view a summary of the act, visit PETA’s Web site at //www.peta.org/mc/facts/fsm1.html); a group to research Pepperberg’s research on the African gray parrot’s status of practical autonomy based on its cognitive abilities]

-resources for researching animal rights cases, dissections, and African gray parrots (science and biology textbooks; encyclopedias; books on animal rights; computers with Internet access)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class: “Should a student have the right to refuse to perform a frog dissection in biology class without being academically penalized for his or her choice? If so, on what basis? If not, why not?” Have students briefly share their opinions regarding this topic while taking notes on their arguments in favor or against the student’s right to choose. Are there existing legal rights that could be used to protect the student? Are there existing legal rights that could be used to protect the frog? Would the students’ opinions regarding this topic change if the animal were a different animal, such as a dog or primate?

2. As a class, read and discuss “Courtroom Champion For 4-Legged Creatures,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why is Steven Wise considered an “oddity” by his fellow lawyers at Harvard Law School?

b. How does Wise summarize the legal work he does?

c. How did Wise’s colleagues react to his legal work in the early 1980’s?

d. How does Wise make his case that animals should have the most basic rights as humans?

e. How does Wise use the concept of “practical autonomy” to further his work for animal rights?

f. Why did Wise sue the U.S. Patent Office in the late 1980’s?

g. Why did Wise lose his case against the U.S. Patent Office?

h. According to Wise, what types of legal cases does he usually win?

i. Why does Wise use the hypothetical case of discovering a band of surviving Neanderthals?

j. According to Wise, how does he “live his beliefs” in his everyday life?

3. Explain to students that today they will be preparing to act as expert witnesses for a university trial on animal rights in the classroom laboratory. They will be given a role in a hypothetical case and will then have to research any relevant information regarding their topic in relation to the case.

The case: A veterinary school student at a local university has refused to dissect a healthy African gray parrot and is therefore going to receive a failing grade from her professor for that particular laboratory assignment. Her fellow students have heard about the case and have staged protests against the university for penalizing her. The university has decided to hold a hearing to decide the student’s fate. The hearing will allow expert witnesses to testify on the student’s behalf and on the behalf of the biology professor who teaches the class.

Divide students into six groups, and have each group select a slip of paper or index card containing a description of a perspective or law that would pertain to the hypothetical animal rights case. Using all available resources, each group completes the following tasks (written on the board for easier student access):

–Summarize their research findings.

–Write an “opening argument” based on the research, in favor or against the student’s case.

–Anticipate a counter-argument that might be used against your stance and write a rebuttal to the hypothetical counter-argument.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In a later class, each group presents their findings and opening arguments in front of a university academic board that is voting to decide the fate of the veterinary student. For homework, each student acts as a member of the university academic board and writes a ruling in favor or against the student based on the most compelling arguments he or she heard during the academic hearing. After the homework is collected, hold a vote to determine the fate of the student.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–How could issues such as gene manipulation, hybridization, and xenografting complicate the legal questions surrounding animal rights?

–How does one prove an animal has practical autonomy?

–Do some non-human animals deserve more rights than others?

–Why have some genetically engineered animals been patented?

–Should animals that have been trained to be vicious receive the same rights as other animals?

–How do animal rights activists further their work in the field?

Evaluation / Assessment:

thoughtful participation in class discussion, participation in their group research and presentations of arguments, and final written rulings on the student’s case.

Vocabulary:

oddity, torts, litigates, breaching, paradigm, colleagues, pioneered, autonomy, sufficient, bonobo, cognition, protolanguage, abstractions, virtually, plaintiff, disposition, capital, muzzle, hybridizations, xenografting, speculated, repulsion, diminishing, symposia

Extension Activities:

1. Choose an animal that you think may fit in Steven Wise’s category of possessing “practical autonomy.” Write an editorial in favor of this animal receiving certain basic rights based on your research regarding the animal’s cognitive and linguistic abilities.

2. Research a hybrid or genetically modified animal that defies classification due to its ambiguous status. Based on your research, do you think that this animal should be considered a new species? Write an essay arguing your point. Include in your essay a definition of “species” and how it applies to this animal’s case.

3. Write an informative pamphlet for animal rights advocates who are interested in shopping for vegan and “cruelty-free” products. List resources they can use to find out if a manufacturer permits testing on animal subjects or if uses animals in their actual products.

4. Visit the Rutgers University School of Law’s Animal Rights Law Project Web site (//www.animal-law.org/index.html). Read about the cases that are highlighted on this site and choose a particular case to “retry” or appeal based on your dissatisfaction with the outcome. Write an opening argument that legally justifies your attempt to reopen this animal rights case.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts- Act out a scene from George Orwell’s political satire “Animal Farm” that portrays certain animals as more powerful, intelligent or “human” than others. After your dramatic portrayal, hold a class discussion about Orwell’s choice to use animals to get his political message across to his audience.

Global Studies- Visit AsiaRecipe.com’s Web site (//asiarecipe.com/religion.html) to view a chart that displays the beliefs regarding food practices of different religious groups around the globe. Choose a religion that has restrictive food practices and write a research paper on how those practices have influenced the animal rights legislation in certain countries where that religion dominates.

Journalism- Find a university or research institute in your area that uses animals as subjects in their research. Interview a person that works in the laboratory about his or her feelings about using animals as research subjects. What type of relationship is formed between the researchers and the animals? Do they sometimes find it difficult to perform the studies? Are there certain types of animal research that they would not perform? After your interview is complete, submit it to your school newspaper.

Media Studies- Research how animals are used in advertisements to sell a variety of products. Can you find savage, cuddly or anthropomorphic portrayals of certain animals? Write an essay on how the treatment or portrayal of the animal is related to the type of product being marketed.
