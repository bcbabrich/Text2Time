The works in the exhibition "David Padilla Cabrera y Linda Matalon" are visually very different, but together these two artists make an interestingly textured show at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.

Mr. Cabrera's small paintings look abstract but are, in fact, shot through with autobiographical references, many to his childhood in a Chicano community (an identity alluded to in the Spanish conjunction used in the show's title).

The bright blue in a series of monochromatic panels is the color of his grandmother's California house, and the very name he's given to a cluster of yellow panels painted with green oval shapes -- "Aunt Sara's Rubber Tree, Our Lady of Guadalupe" -- suggests a rich, complicated fragrance.

As in the past, Mr. Cabrera's work is disarming in its formal modesty and its subtly stated concerns. Here and there, though, the new paintings have an unresolved, possibly transitional look. To some degree a lack of finish is what they're all about, but there's also a sense that good ideas have not yet been pushed as far as they could go.
