HOUSTON – Tracy Stevens, the wife of Butler Coach Brad Stevens, summed up a second straight Final Four trip this way: “Insanity.”

That is not just because her 34-year-old husband has already won as many N.C.A.A. tournament games, 10, in the past four seasons as Bob Knight did in his final 15 seasons coaching at Indiana and Texas Tech. She described the Final Four as insanity because of her traveling party: eight children under the age of 6.



The Butler coaches have a combined nine children, though only eight could make the trip to Houston. The Stevenses have two children: Brady, 5, and Kinsley, who is 22 months old.

Tracy Stevens has traveled with a large group for most of the past three weeks. First, the gang went to Washington, then it moved on to New Orleans, and now it has arrived in Houston.

Tracy Stevens, who formerly worked as a labor and employment lawyer, has tried to persuade the children to enjoy the trips, to take in the sights. It was easier said than done.

While the Bulldogs practiced here, the children ran around, jumped near and climbed on the raised court at Reliant Stadium. The wives, and others, tired themselves out chasing after them. Insanity, indeed.

“But I’m not ready for it to end,” Tracy Stevens said.
