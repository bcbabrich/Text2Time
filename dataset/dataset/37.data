When Nina Ricci, the brand of L’Air du Temps, announced that its most recent creative director appointments would be two relative unknowns — Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh, ages 34 and 29, respectively, who share a men’s wear brand and Dutch/Caribbean roots — it seemed a desperate bid for millennial relevance.

After all, this was the house defined by fluttering femininity, and the duo had made their name by winning the Grand Jury Prize at the 2018 Hyères fashion festival with a collection that featured inflatable fish.

On the other hand, for the last very many years, other, more established designers had been trying to inject that je ne sais quoi into Ricci clothes, with only occasional success. Maybe it called for something radical. There are times when you have to break those eggs.

On Friday, however, in their first collection for the brand, Mr. Botter and Ms. Herrebrugh only cracked them.
