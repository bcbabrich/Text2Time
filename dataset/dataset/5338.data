President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria has taken his boldest move yet to liberalize the country's single-party rule by ousting the most influential hard-liner.

The move came a few days before a national referendum Thursday that may usher in some democratic changes in Algeria.

The referendum concerns a transfer of some presidential powers to the Prime Minister, who will be responsible to the Algerian Parliament. Mr. Benjedid has said that a new legislature would be elected and that candidates would no longer have to belong to the ruling party.

Over the weekend, the President announced the dismissal of Mohammed Sherif Mussadieh, who had been generally viewed as his second-in-command. Mr. Benjedid also undertook fundamental changes in the ruling party's administration, which is preparing for a party congress in December, and dismissed the army's military security chief, Gen. Mejdoub Lakehal Ayat. Further Purge Is Seen
