In times of abundance, American consumers are crackerjacks at convincing themselves that they desire whatever is in great supply. They’re nudged along by culture that stimulates and expresses that demand.

When corn was plentiful in Appalachia at the start of the 20th century, the nation dutifully sopped up the surplus in corn whiskey. In the last two decades, a second corn surplus stoked the obesity epidemic, as Americans guzzled corn syrup by the silo.

Obesity culture abounds today in the form of cup-holders and giant tableware. But its influence can also be found in the pushback against it: foodie-ism and pro-anorexia artifacts (including “thinspiration” videos and fashion photography), which play a significant role in refining, sanctifying and curbing demand for food.



Overproduction is not just an agricultural phenomenon. Consumer goods, too, can end up in surplus. It may be hard to imagine that man in his natural state does not crave millions of units of Bounty ExtraSoft paper towels or Dove Ultimate Cool Essentials Anti-perspirant Deodorant, but it seems safe to say that the profusion of this stuff may sometimes eclipse our need for it.

Who will relieve the groaning supermarket shelves? That’s where culture comes in. Specifically what’s in play are the cultures of couponing, hoarding and stockpiling — the latest practices to obsess TV and the Web.

For a glimpse of the drama, check out the excerpt below of TLC’s “Extreme Couponing,” a deceptively simple look at the complex drama of American spending and the paradoxes of parsimony.

Retailers have, of course, long used coupons to shed extra inventory. But changes in the global supply chain have also conspired to simultaneously amp up supply. In 2010, the United States imported about $1 billion worth of “toiletries and cosmetics” from China, where production costs are low. But the price of those items at the cash register, even without coupons, is deceptive, according to Susan Helper, the chair of the economics department at Case Western Reserve, because costs to the environment are not cranked in. Environmental costs are especially substantial if you count not just carbon emissions but the building, heating and cooling of storage facilities, private houses, roads and cars to accommodate the personal “stockpiles” of sundries on display in shows like “Extreme Couponing.” By ignoring these costs, Helper told me, “firms charge too little for their products, causing people to buy too many of them.” So they make more.

TLC is a television network that tirelessly shores up the current American middle class with shows about big families, cupcakes, Sarah Palin and outfits that flatter plus-size figures. TLC also runs an especially macabre program about hoarders called “Hoarding: Buried Alive.”

When faced with a corn surplus, we stuff it into our bodies for safekeeping. When faced with a stuff surplus, we cram in into our houses.

And what better place for useless dry goods than our houses? Americans now inhabit, after all, oversized dwellings, with unfinished basements and extra rooms, staple-gunned into existence during the housing boom. These spaces are perfect for what couponers proudly call “stockpiles.” That great bear-market term is used in this case by shoppers who claim to be saving their outlandishly sized supermarket hauls for rainy days, the apocalypse or friends in need.

Couponers acquire stuff in such obscene quantities because their coupons, gleaned from newspaper inserts and online, reward buying in quantity. (They also reward buying newspapers, and “Extreme Couponing” doubles as an ad for subscribing promiscuously to print papers.)

What’s more, the presence of generous supermarket aisles, doublewide shopping carts, and patient and supportive checkout clerks all conspire to encourage the acquisition of dozens of every kind of grocery geegaw, including mustard, conditioner and salad-dressing packets.

Unlike hoarders, who are typically ashamed of their houses, extreme couponers venerate their stockpiles. Where a hoard is disgusting and proof of pathology, a stockpile is as orderly as a grocery store, and proof of sound home economics. Extreme couponers install pegboards and shelves that revolve expiring cans, and even invite friends to “shop” from their stockpiles. Some couponers also give canned goods to food banks and toothbrushes to the military.

Astute online commentary about “Extreme Couponing” followed a recent review on EW.com. Debate crackled over about whether couponing is indeed thrifty, with some arguing that it’s fun and enriching, and others arguing that its yields don’t cover the couponers’ investment in space, print newspapers, gear and time. (Many also wondered about the real difference between a virtuous stockpile and a hideous hoard, with a commenter named Cindy C proposing that TLC rename the show “Extremely Hoarding Coupons.”)

With John Williams-style music, the show derives suspense from the much-hyped “checkouts,” during which we’re given to believe a couponer might have miscalculated, and end up on the hook for more money than she has. Worse still, the register might jam.

The extreme couponers, who almost never fail to bring their checkout totals down from four figures to one or two, tend to see themselves as crusaders. Some believe they are out to defeat unjust retailers. Many believe they are saving their families from ruin. Still others believe they are on a God-given mission to teach thrift.

With their stockpiles reminiscent of bomb shelters, couponers often imagine they’re part of a war effort. And perhaps they are. There are far too many cheap consumer goods in circulation. Someone needs to take them off the market and pay to warehouse and even distribute them, as the government once did with cheese and butter.

Extreme couponers and even hoarders may be doing their patriotic part by filling their houses with manufacturing surplus. That may be necessary for the economy. But what does it cost them?
