MADRID — Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat trick to lead host Real Madrid to a commanding 3-0 win over Atlético Madrid on Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal.

Ronaldo scored on a header in the 10th minute, on a strike into the top corner in the 73rd, and on a close-range shot in the 86th to give Real Madrid, the defending champions, a comfortable lead headed into next week’s second leg at Atlético’s Vicente Calderón Stadium.

Monaco hosts Juventus in the first leg of the other semifinal on Wednesday.

Real Madrid, which is looking to reach its third final in four seasons, was in control from the start at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Ronaldo had scored five goals in the two legs of the quarterfinals against Bayern Munich, including a hat trick in the second leg at Bernabéu.

He opened the scoring on Tuesday after Atlético’s defense failed to fully clear a cross. Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro sent the ball back in with a bouncing shot, and Ronaldo got ahead of defender Stefan Savic to knock it past Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak.
