'Adolescents'

Julie Saul Gallery

Adolescence, with its mix of unfixed sexuality, mood-swinging narcissism, nihilist glamour and abused innocence, has been a major theme in art of the 90's, and it's still going strong, as this show of photographs suggests.

The historical material by August Sander, Disfarmer and Diane Arbus is familiar stuff, though Arbus's scary 1962 ''Teen-Ager with a Baseball Bat, N.Y.C'' feels right up to the road-rage minute. But the older images set the stage for the contemporary artists who make up the bulk of the show.

They include the Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra, whose color portraits of youths in bathing suits on beaches in the United States and Europe (four are included here) have the face-forward formality of studio shots but catch their subjects in poses that seem at once self-conscious and unguarded.

These attitudes also play out in two 1977 Ellen Brooks pictures of nude teen-agers, one of a girl with a knowing, sidelong smile, the other of a stunned-looking boy; and in Eve Fowler's recent head shots of young male hustlers with troubled complexions and over-pitched expressions (eager smiles, serious snarls).
