New enterprises, in addition to the inns, include a shop that commissions local crafts for sale called the Wild Turkey, after the local name for the bald ibis, another rare bird of the region. At the the Wild Turkey, one of several small stores occupying the restored buildings in the old town square, we bought a spiral-bound guidebook -- ''Wakkerstroom Bird and Nature Guide,'' by Warwick and Michele Tarboton -- that describes the plants, animals and geology of a number of walks and drives in the area.

A half-day's drive to the southeast from Wakkerstroom, most of the way through groves of eucalyptus, are the sites of bloody conflicts between European settlers and the Zulu Kingdom in the 19th century. We arrived at the Babanango Valley Lodge, perched high in an unspoiled valley too dry to have been disfigured by tree farms, in the cool of the evening.

The lodge is a few miles in from the paved highway near the tiny, rural town of Babanango, but easily accessible by car. Handsomely redecorated in the style of a wealthy planter's ranch house, Babanango Lodge is more elegant than the Weaver's Nest, with luxurious rooms and a dinner table lighted by candles where we enjoyed fresh produce from the lodge's own farm, and excellent South African wines.

A mysterious hooting we heard outside our room at dawn turned out to come from ground hornbills, turkey-size black birds with huge bills and bright red facial wattles, that we later saw catching beetles in a field not far from the house.

In a couple of pre-breakfast walks around the lodge's flower gardens and adjacent rugged terrain, we found two dozen species of birds, ranging from several kinds of brilliantly colored sunbirds and barbets to majestic, soaring jackal buzzards. It was not primarily for the birding that we had come, however, but to visit the battlefields.

JOHN TURNER, proprietor of the Babanango with his wife, Meryn, leads a mesmerizing Land Rover tour of the Isandhlwana Battlefield. Stationing the visitor at one vantage point after another in these spectacular dry hills, Mr. Turner explains how the Zulus managed to surprise and slaughter 1,357 better-armed British and black colonial soldiers on Jan. 22, 1879, and how a handful of troops at the nearby British depot at Rorke's Drift staved off a Zulu assault the next day.

The little museum at Rorke's Drift, with its old-fashioned life-size dioramas, makes an effort to respect the dead on both sides. A richly illustrated book on sale there, ''Isandhlwana,'' by John Laband and Jeff Mathew, comes in a Zulu language version and gives as much attention to the Zulu commanders and their tactics as to the British.
