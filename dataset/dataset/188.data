To the Editor:

As an Army veteran, I have gone to the V.A. Medical Center in Washington, D.C., for over 16 years. During that time I have had treatment for prostate cancer, a new heart valve, a new hip, eye problems, skin problems and hearing.

I have been treated with respect, expertise, timely care and medical professionalism. Many other veterans would surely agree. I am tired of reading about all the problems with the V.A., often espoused by those who do not want to see government-sponsored medical care succeed, as it has in most industrialized countries.

It is time for our nation to face up to the challenge of providing accessible and affordable health care for all our citizens, as “single payer” would do, instead of bashing a great health facility in our country, and its leadership, for the purpose of proving that government-sponsored health care cannot work.

To the Editor:

David J. Shulkin wants the world to believe that he was fired because of a grand conspiracy within the Trump administration to privatize veterans’ health care. This is simply not true. There is no serious effort to privatize or dismantle the V.A.’s health care system. Even individuals like me who have been harshly critical of the V.A. at times recognize that its health care system plays an important role in providing care for our nation’s veterans.

But many inside and outside the department urgently want to reform the V.A. so it effectively meets the needs of all its patients — a task it is still failing at. Recent inspector general reports showed that our nation’s heroes continue to wait too long for care, even for routine needs, and the department still fails to accurately report wait times.
