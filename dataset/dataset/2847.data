The government's economic report on Thursday showing a surge in business investment in computers and software came as no surprise to the team at Reel FX Creative Studios, a producer of special effects for television commercials and movie studios.

This year, it has purchased 80 new machines that render the computer-generated images that are the company's products -- ranging from the brightly colored droplets of sweat trickling off athletes in Gatorade ads to the fires, explosions and dust storms in ''Saving Jessica Lynch,'' a docudrama scheduled for broadcast on NBC tomorrow night.

This new low-cost hardware and software has helped Reel FX, based in Dallas, save money and take on new work, too, encouraging its decision makers to add another 80 computers by year-end. ''It all adds up to dollars and new opportunities,'' explained Chuck Peil, executive director of business development for Reel FX.

Business investment in technology is finally picking up across much of the American economy. Consumer spending, lifted by tax cuts and a home mortgage refinancing boom, was the primary reason the economy grew at its fastest rate since 1984 during the three months ended in September. Yet business spending on information technology -- computer hardware, software and services -- increased at an annual rate of more than 15 percent. This, in fact, was the second consecutive quarter of encouraging growth for information technology investment, which also rose more than 15 percent in the three months ended in June.
