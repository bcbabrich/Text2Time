As they were coming off the field after the game, the two coaches hugged and Mike Gottfried of Pitt said to Dick MacPherson of Syracuse, ''Go win the national championship.''

That possibility, remote in September, grew on the last day of October as Syracuse won its eighth straight game, a not-so-easy 24-10 victory over Pittsburgh.

Don McPherson, the Orange quarterback, made a series of spectacular plays in the first half as Syracuse sped to a 24-3 lead while the Panthers did next to nothing.

Then Pitt switched quarterbacks, playing a freshman, Darnell Dickerson, who had never been in a varsity game before. In the next half the defense stiffened, Dickerson became a passer to be feared and Craig Heyward continued to pound the Orange while the Panthers scored one touchdown and threatened twice more.
