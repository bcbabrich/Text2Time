AS long as Tommie Frazier has been at Ne braska four years, right on target for graduation -- he has been asked why a man from Florida would choose to winter in the Upper Midwest.

"I had to go out of state to be the kind of quarterback I wanted to be," he said.

As it turns out, the Florida quarterback has Nebraska roots. Danny Wuerffel lived in the state only one year, but it was the 1983 season when Tom Osborne went for 2 points in the Orange Bowl.

They are quite different, the two quarterbacks who will compete in the Fiesta Bowl tomorrow night for the 1995 national title.

Frazier runs. He ran from Bradenton, Fla., to Lincoln, Neb., to live up to his potential.

Wuerffel passes. He has passed through a lot of towns because his father, Lieut. Col. Jon Wuerffel, is a chaplain in the Air Force.
