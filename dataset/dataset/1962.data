Paris’s labyrinthine underground Les Halles marketplace is about to get a new destination that even American visitors will be able to ask for by name. Cinema Street (known locally as “Rue de Cinema”) will be dedicated on Friday by Mayor Bertrand Delanoë, Agence France-Presse reported, to celebrate the completion of renovations on the marketplace’s historic Forum des Images movie theater. The street offers visitors a modern 16-screen multiplex cinema and a library named for the director François Truffaut, with a collection of 17,000 books and 10,000 DVDs; the renovated Forum will also have a vault of 5,500 films, all newly transferred to digital format. “This is the first time that a city has said to itself that its memory does not only exist in books but also in images,” Laurence Herszberg, the director of the Forum, told Agence France-Presse.
