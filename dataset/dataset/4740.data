"A show for thinking adults, very artistic, very theatrical but very athletic," she said. "The image of professional skaters is that after they turn pro, they cut down on the sport and only have to look beautiful.

"Usually, ice shows are all floofy and fluffy. I don't have anything against it; it's important to have those. But that's not something I worked so hard for, for 20 years, you know, clowns, poodles and snow falling from the ceiling. That's not real skating. I want people to be entertained, but I want them to leave the show and talk about it. Our show is provocative."

The show is scheduled to conclude its North American run in early March, but that hardly means another Caribbean vacation right away. As the principal asset of her own company in Frankfurt and the principal client of a marketing firm in Charlotte, N.C., she is finding her commercial options expanding.

This week, she was in New York to discuss a forthcoming line of skating attire from Danskin that she is helping design. What fun, and what a departure from the old days in East Germany, when the authorities gave her a say in the costumes she would wear in competition but little more.

"This is totally different," she said. "This is leotards, tights, leggings, everything. I know what I like to have, the kind of cut, the prints. It's a dream to be able to do what I want and wonderful to be in it from the beginning." Fascinated by Fascination

Other opportunities are under consideration, including a series of competitions for professional skaters that she and Boitano plan to organize. But she declined to discuss them with any specificity until plans were complete or contracts signed.

Meanwhile, she has become intrigued by the growing fascination the rest of the world is developing for her. This is the kind of stuff that sort of embarrasses her in conversation, but she let it slip there was this one time not long ago, in Dallas, where she was performing at a rink in a fancy shopping mall. Scads of men, about four deep, stood mesmerized by her. And she loved it.
