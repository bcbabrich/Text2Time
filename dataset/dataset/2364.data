Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. List what they know and wish to know about Albert Einstein in a K-W-L chart.

2. Learn about Einstein’s iconic status and future scientists on his level by reading and discussing the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome.”

3. Create, in pairs, trading cards about Einstein and another notable scientist.

4. Develop a job description that seeks out “the next Einstein.”

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-index cards (two per pair)

-trading cards (baseball cards and/or other collectible cards; optional)

-copies of the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050301tuesday.html (one per student)

-resources about Albert Einstein and other famous scientists (computers with Internet access, almanacs, library resources, encyclopedias, etc.)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Before class, create a KWL chart on the board to complete as a class. (Create three columns: the left – K – column should be titled “What Do We Know?”; the middle – W – column should be titled “What Do We Want to Know”?”; the right – L – column should be titled “What Did We Learn?” The K and W columns will be completed at this point in the lesson; the L column may be filled out after the completion of the research in Activity 3 below.) Upon entering class, students respond to the following prompt in their journals (also written on the board prior to class): “Copy the following table into your journal, and write at least two statements in the K and W columns about Albert Einstein.” After a few minutes, allow students to share their responses and copy them onto the chart on the board.

Discuss, as a class, what students know or believe about Albert Einstein, including his achievements, background, fame, legacy, etc. Students may write their opinions in the W column as statements they would like to determine as true or false about the scientist.

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050301tuesday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. Why was Albert Einstein, in his adolescence, not likely, in many eyes, to amount to scientific greatness?

b. What are some examples of Einstein’s stunning success in science and society?

c. Why does Einstein’s development as a scientist both “comfort” and “haunt” people, according to the article?

d. How does Dr. Michael Turner describe Einstein’s appeal, and why is this description an important quality for scientists?

e. Why might it be “distracting, daunting and ultimately demoralizing” for a younger scientist to be called “the new Einstein”?

f. To what does Dr. Stephen Hawking attribute the constant comparisons of new scientists to Einstein?

g. What does it mean to articulate “the role of the individual in modern science,” according to the article?

h. What combination of qualities did Einstein possess that helped him achieve his iconic status?

i. Why is the field of physics “vast and sprawling”?

j. What does Dr. Edward Witten consider to be Einstein’s notable reason for success?

k. How does Dr. Michael Turner measure a scientist’s impact, and using this measurement, how does Einstein compare with other scientists?

l. What are the different conceptions and images of “Einstein,” according to the article?

m. What was the social/political background during Einstein’s heyday?

n. According to the article, what were some other descriptors for Einstein, besides “the Elvis of science”?

o. What, according to the article, are some distinctive attributes of Einstein as described by other physicists?

p. What is generally considered Einstein’s greatest achievement?

q. Why is general relativity described as “the result of pure thought”?

r. How did Einstein’s personal and political life alter his love of science, if at all?

s. What is meant by Einstein’s “perceived irreverence”?

t. How does science represent a field by which someone without a “privileged background” can succeed?

u. How did Einstein typically start off his papers?

v. Why have philosophy and physics become distant, according to the article?

w. In what ways has modern science entered into the popular consciousness?

x. How does Einstein compare with Watson and Crick, or Dr. Stephen J. Hawking?

y. Where is the place for new ideas in physics?

z. What are the two conceptions of reality, in terms of general relativity and quantum mechanics?

aa. What attempts to bridge these two differing conceptions?

bb. According to the article, what are possible “Einsteinian opportunities”?

At this point, students may draw facts from the New York Times article for the L column from the Warm-Up activity about what they have just learned about Einstein.

3. Explain that students, in pairs, will be researching, using available sources, enough information to create two scientist trading cards (using index cards): one on Albert Einstein and one on another scientist of note. (If available, teachers may distribute baseball or other collectible cards as examples of trading cards before proceeding with the activity.) Possible suggestions are some of the scientists mentioned in the New York Times article like Dr. Stephen Hawking or famous scientists of the past such as Marie Curie, Rachel Carson, Charles Darwin, etc. Encourage students to engage their own creativity and originality in creating the trading cards. At minimum, cards must have:

-a picture of the scientist

-basic biographical information such as date and place of birth (and, if applicable, death)

-a list of achievements, discoveries, awards, etc.

-memorable quotes

-other interesting facts or trivia about the scientist

Once students have completed their trading cards, they should join together into groups of two pairs (four students). Students should first compare and contrast their Albert Einstein trading cards. As pairs share, students should also add to the L column from the Warm-Up activity the new facts they learn about Albert Einstein. Then students should show their second card and describe the scientist they have selected to profile. Students may discuss which of the profiled scientists might have, or have had, the potential to reach iconic status like Einstein and why.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students complete the following task (written on the board for students to copy down before leaving class): “Recall the headline of the New York Times article: “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome.” Look at want ads and other resources on the Internet or in a newspaper and come up with a list of information generally found in a job posting for a scientist, such as organizational description, academic or work experience, compensation, etc. Then write a job description for a scientist that you feel would engage applicants with the potential to be the ‘next Einstein.'” In a future class, have students share their job descriptions.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-What is the most influential scientific discovery of your generation? Of your parents’ generation?

-What are some examples of philosophical quandaries?

-Do you think Einstein is “overrated”? Why or why not?

-Do you have to understand science to fully appreciate Einstein’s achievements? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, thoughtful participation in class discussions, cooperation in small groups, creation of trading cards about famous scientists, and job descriptions seeking the “next Einstein.”

Extension Activities:

1. Choose one of Einstein’s scientific accomplishments and create a children’s book describing the discovery in both easy-to-understand text and visuals.

2. Make a list of the heroes or icons in current popular culture. Think about both fictional and real-life heroes. Compare and contrast the characteristics of a fictional and a real-life hero. What makes each one a hero in the public’s eyes? Is it something he or she did in the past, or something done over time? What sets him or her apart from other characters or people? Do heroes tend to have certain interests or occupations?

3. Search the Internet for images of Einstein. Why was he so photogenic? What personality attributes are captured by these images? Imagine you are the curator of a photo gallery exhibit on Einstein. What text descriptions would you give of each photo?

4. Einstein’s discoveries are often difficult for young students to understand initially. Explore the Web Site devoted to Einstein at the American Museum of Natural History online (//www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/). Describe at least five strategies used by the Web site to make the science more accessible to a younger audience.

5. Einstein was considered a genius. What does that word mean? Browse the following Web sites: //www.cse.emory.edu/sciencenet/mismeasure/genius/research04.html and //hem.bredband.net/b153434/Index.htm#Introduction about the “intelligence quotient,” or IQ. Research the controversy surrounding IQ tests. First, learn about IQ tests, what they test, how they test it and what different score levels are supposed to represent. Then look for critiques of IQ tests. Describe the main criticisms and alternative intelligence assessments that have been created. Write an opinion essay about whether you think IQ tests are a legitimate test of a person’s intelligence, and why. Does Einstein’s high IQ make you view him in an even more iconic manner?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Global Studies – Create a timeline reviewing Einstein’s role in the movement against global nuclear proliferation. Why was he called “humanity’s atomic conscience”?

Media Studies – The New York Times article notes that Dr. Stephen Hawking says that constant comparisons of him to Einstein have less to do with his own accomplishments and more to do with “the media’s need for heroes.” What does he mean by this sentiment, and do you agree? Write an essay in which you cite examples of, or lack of, this “need.”

Teaching with The Times – Keep a scrapbook of newspaper articles that paint someone as “heroic” or worthy of iconic status. Are there patterns to the types of “hero” stories that are reported in The New York Times? Write an analysis in which you cite your clippings and describe differing definitions of hero or icon.
