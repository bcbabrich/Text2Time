DESPITE the ultramodern aura of devices that play compressed digital music files, from the Apple iPod player to the Rio Karma, they all share one anachronistic trait: they only have two audio channels. The basic stereo format used on vinyl records since the 1950's and carried over to CD's in the 1980's still defines most recorded music.

By contrast, DVD movies come with Dolby Digital 5.1-channel soundtracks that can parcel the audio among five speakers (and a subwoofer for extra-low tones) to provide the illusion that you are inside the action, surrounded by sound.

Such surround-sound or multichannel audio is making its way into recorded music through high-end entertainment systems that play Super Audio CD's or DVD Audio discs. But surround sound may soon come to the Internet and hand-held music players as well.

The Fraunhofer Institute, the German research center that led the effort to create the MP3 digital music format, recently announced a new version called MP3 Surround that adds the extra audio channels needed for 5.1 sound without appreciably increasing file size. According to JÃ¼rgen Herre of the institute, MP3 Surround files can also play in conventional stereo mode on two-channel devices.
