General John W. Vessey Jr. closed out 46 years of military service today by turning to an honor guard and saying, with a gentle wave of his hand, ''Thanks, troops, thanks.''

In the ceremony marking his retirement, General Vessey sat on the reviewing stand in a cavernous hangar with President Reagan, Vice President Bush and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger to hear himself lauded after three years on duty as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top military officer.

Seated in stands behind them were senior civilian officials, the chiefs of staff of the services, most of the 28 other four-star generals and admirals, and hundreds of other officers, senior noncommissioned officers and their families.

But in the end, it was to the soldiers, marines, sailors, airmen and coast guardsmen, the color guard with banners and battle streamers fluttering in the soft breeze, the Army Band and the red-coated fife and drum corps to whom General Vessey turned to say goodbye.
