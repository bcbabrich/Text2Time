Today is the 16th anniversary of one of those fun days in baseball history, when Rickey Henderson broke the career stolen-base record in the afternoon and Nolan Ryan fired his seventh no-hitter at night.

They have a cool statue of Ryan here at Rangers Ballpark, way beyond center field in a gathering area for fans. The inscription says something like, “He came here a star, he left here a legend.” That pretty much sums it up.

I remember those five years Ryan pitched for the Rangers, and every few weeks, it seemed he was doing something incredible. He got his 300th win, 5,000th strikeout, and his last two no-hitters while pitching for Texas. He didn’t stop pitching until he tore his elbow at the Seattle Kingdome at age 46. The last pitch he ever threw was hit for a grand slam by Dann Howitt.

Anyway, I asked Sean Henn, the Yankees’ 26-year-old lefty, what he remembered about going to Rangers games as a kid growing up about 30 minutes away. He said he distinctly remembered a game at the old Arlington Stadium, Rangers vs. Yankees, with Wade Boggs playing for the Yanks and Ryan pitching for the Rangers.

“You could hear him grunting on every pitch,” Henn said.

Meanwhile, Phil Hughes just froze Mark Teixeira on a nifty changeup to end the first inning. Just 5,708 more strikeouts until Hughes catches Ryan.
