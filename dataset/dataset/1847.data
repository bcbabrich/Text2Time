Updated, 12:26 p.m. | At first blush, the statement almost read like an April Fool’s Day joke. The New York State Commission on Investigation issued a press release this morning saying that it was “investigating the investigations” surrounding former Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s efforts to use State Police records to try to tarnish the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. But it turns out that the commission is quite serious.



After all, in a state that has been known for political scandal lately, there are an awful lot of investigations going on. Alfred D. Lerner, the chairman of the commission since 2005, said in a statement:

In August 2007, the State of New York Commission of Investigation issued a statement noting the various investigations into the so-called Troopergate matter by the attorney general, the inspector general, the Public Integrity (formerly Ethics) Commission, the Albany County district attorney, and the Senate Investigations Committee. We said then that we were closely following these inquiries and had initiated our own preliminary review. We also said in our August statement that “in order to avoid the danger of conflicting investigations, with the inherent possibility of impeding one or all of them, we are postponing any further investigation until the district attorney has had a reasonable opportunity to review this matter or other factors require commission action.” While as a matter of policy, the commission generally refrains from commenting publicly on pending investigations, we believe this matter is so crucial to the confidence New Yorkers have in their government that the commission feels it is important to announce that it has renewed its investigation into this whole matter. Let me be clear. The commission is not investigating the events concerning Troopergate; more than enough investigations of the issues surrounding those events have taken or are taking place. Rather, the commission is investigating the investigations. We are seeking to determine the efficacy of the various investigatory efforts, including those of the Albany County district attorney, the state inspector general and the State Commission on Public Integrity. Our goal is to report to the people of New York and its government leaders on the effectiveness of those investigations and to propose recommendations for how investigations of high-ranking state officials should take place going forward to ensure that New Yorkers can continue to have confidence in their government and government leaders.

In a phone interview, Mr. Lerner, who was previously a presiding judge on the appellate division of State Supreme Court, said his commission decided to wait until the release of a report last week by P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney.

“We had had a preliminary inquiry under way for some time,” Mr. Lerner said.

Mr. Lerner made it clear that the multiple, overlapping investigations were, at the least, confusing even to political insiders — not to mention ordinary New Yorkers.

“Many people in the state have felt that the various investigations have been dysfunctional, that they haven’t proceeded in an orderly fashion, to say the least,” he said. “We’re not intending here to be critical of any one particular person or any one particular body, but we are concerned with the systemic problem that exists. Perhaps when we conclude our inquiry, we’ll be able to offer some suggestions to the governor and the Legislature with respect to some systemic prospects.”

The commission was established in 1958 but has its origins in a statewide crime commission established by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey in 1951. “We have a very broad authority to investigate anything of public concern,” Mr. Lerner said.
