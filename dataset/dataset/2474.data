To the Editor:

Re "Search and Rescue," by Tim O'Reilly (Op-Ed, Sept. 28):

The Authors Guild's objections to Google's plan to offer a searchable database of the collections of five libraries is analogous to the Recording Industry Association of America's imposition of limitations on digital radio (including "terrestrial" stations with Internet simulcasts) through its lobbying of Congress during creation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.

The goal was to stop the spread of music file-sharing, but restricting the number of songs noncommercial radio can play by an artist in a given time period reduces the positive effect exposure can have on establishing the artist.

With 38 years in "terrestrial" radio in New York, I know that the more songs I can play in a concentrated time, the greater the listener excitement and the more apt that excited listener is to buy the album.

If authors want their work to survive, it had better be in digital libraries. If record companies want to establish new artists, they should support outlets that offer exposure. Why tie the very hands that are trying help these artists achieve their goals?
