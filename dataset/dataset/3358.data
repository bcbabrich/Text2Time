One by one, the options kept fading for Lauren Jackson. Worn down on the inside, barely able to get free on the perimeter, Jackson, the young star of the Australian team, resorted to the only move she had left against the Americans, a move straight out of a heated schoolyard:

She pulled someone's hair.

With four minutes left in the gold medal game tonight, and while jostling under the basket, the frustrated 19-year-old Jackson plucked Lisa Leslie's ponytail, sending the hairpiece into a row of photographers. Leslie was embarrassed, but not enough to hold her tongue on the way up the floor.

''I told her she could have the hair; I'll take the gold,'' said Leslie, the United States center.

And the Americans spoiled the teenager's party by routing Australia, 76-54, to win their second straight Olympic basketball gold medal in front of 15,000 people who had wanted to see them put in their places.

Leslie and her teammates dedicated the game to Teresa Edwards, the 36-year-old, five-time Olympian who is retiring.

The United States women turned in a virtuoso big-game performance. Leslie was a force underneath, scoring 15 points and gathering 9 rebounds, using her sinewy frame and footwork to make Jackson work inside. Edwards and Dawn Staley moved the ball on offense and pressured the Australians on defense. Sheryl Swoopes (14 points) ran the floor, Natalie Williams (15 points, 9 rebounds) and Yolanda Griffith (13 points, 12 rebounds) muscled inside, and everyone but the injured Chamique Holdsclaw got off the bench to celebrate in the final minutes.
