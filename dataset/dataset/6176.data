The astonishing thing about his book its omnivorous credulity. Here was a man who, in his 20's, skillfully manipulated the news media and a sizable part of the body politic—apparently without picking up single shred of intellectual sophistication. His descriptions of his various therapies are masterpieces of oversimplification when they are not downright comic or pathetic.

A man who helped to teach a whole generation to be skeptical of their elected representatives in government seems to be willing to accept almost anything that calls itself therapy. He tells us of discovering, during his period of Fischer‐Hoffman Psychic Therapy, his “spiritual guide,” in the form of a buxom but incorporeal woman who gave her name as Lorraine. “Hello, Jerry,” she said, “I'm your guide who has come from another plane of reality to help you.” When Lorraine had “nurtured” Jerry as far as she could along the path to psychic wholeness, she disappeared and was replaced by the muscular and equally impalpable Tony, who represented “discipline.”

In sex therapy, the author learned that “sex is sex, and nothing more … whenever sex gets troublesome, it's not worth it.” He began to hunger for a child, even imagining himself taking care of it, but discovered—there's always a “but” in his book—that he was not willing to trade in the adventure of the self for the satisfactions of commitment. He seems never to have conceived of the two as reconcilable. After all, look what happened to his dearest friend Abbie Hoffman. He was living “in ecstasy” with his wife, Anita, his daughter, America, his dog, Butterscotch, and his vegetable garden, when the New York police “framed” him on a charge of selling cocaine. Since there was no question in his mind that he would not be railroaded to jail, Mr. Hoffman was forced to “go underground.”

Dries Nostalgic Tears

One of the chapters of “Growing (Up) at 37” is a long, homiletic letter to Abbie Hoffman, in which the author dries a few nostalgic, self‐congratulatory tears. At the end of the book, one feels that the author's personality has not so much “mellowed” as decayed. Doing was his talent, and, on the evidence, being is not his thing. He reminds one of Wallace Stevens's poem “The Revolutionist Stops for Orangeade.” In Jerry's case, it was carrot juice, which he drank in such quantities that turned his legs orange.

On the last page of the book, Mr. Rubin gives us his nostrum for political health “The consciousness movement and the political movement have a lot to learn from one another. A fusion of the two will create the healthy balance, politicising the growth movement and providing a spiritual and psychological base politics.” Wow, it's enough to blow your mind.
