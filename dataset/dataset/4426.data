The Talking Band has a long history of treating topical subjects in imaginatively oblique ways. And "The Blue Sky Is a Curse," a trilogy of surreal music-theater pieces whose title was inspired by a Magritte painting, is typical of the whimsical approach taken by the venerable experimental ensemble.

Its three related vignettes, all set in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, evoke personal alienation against a canvas of violent social upheaval. In Paul Zimet's three-character play "Baron Bones," an agoraphobic poet (Tom Nelis) and his Eastern European girlfriend (Terry McCarthy) exchange opposite views of Los Angeles. When she leaves, he is visited by a potion-peddling black shaman (William Badgett), who takes him on a mental journey into the heart of the riots.

"Brown Dog Is Dead," which was written and composed by Ellen Maddow, portrays elderly immigrants, Nino and Pearl (Mr. Zimet and Tina Shepard) who bicker, reminisce, and fret about what to do because a Social Security computer has registered Pearl as deceased. As Nino drifts into surrealistic reveries and mysterious leaks appear in the house, the play produces a dizzying sense of a tiny world crumbling to bits inside of a larger one that is going up in flames.

The two vignettes are linked by the musicalized sounds of the plumbers working in the building where the characters live. And the final piece, Ms. Maddow's one-act opera, "The Plumber's Helper," focuses on the plumbers (Mr. Badgett, Ms. Maddow, Ms. McCarthy) who bemoan their frustrating love lives. Their confessions suggest a modern-day variation on Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," in the language of contemporary sexual politics.
