New proof of the links between mental problems and overall health has been mustered in a large study of 29,915 Federal employees and their families who filed claims for mental-health treatment with Aetnafrom 1980 to 1983. The average of their claims for health problems of all kinds - not just psychological problems - was $158.82 a month, more than 70 percent higher than health insurance claims of 16,468 other Federal employee families with the same coverage but no mental problems. On an encouraging note, after mental-health treatment, the group's use of both mental and general health care declined, to $137 a month, according to James O. Blose, an analyst with the Human Ecology Institute in Chapel Hill, N.C.

Despite the downward trend, however, the average claim for people with psychological problems remained higher after three years of mental-health treatment than the average - $108 a month - three years before treatment was started.

Mr. Blose and Harold D. Holder, director of the Prevention Research Center in Berkeley, Calif., published these findings in the October issue of Hospital and Community Psychiatry.

Dr. Kessler, of American Psychmanagement, said large employers had recently been paying more attention to their mental-health costs, which often are rising 25 percent. Not soon enough, however, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health-care analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. ''Very few employers intelligently manage their mental-health benefits,'' he said. ''Corporate America has got to rethink its whole atttitude toward mental-health benefits, and I don't see them doing that until they get totally taken to the cleaners.'' Jeff Goldsmith, head of Health Futures, a Chicago management consultant firm, is equally vehement. ''One of the hottest areas for cost containment over the next two or three years will be in-patient psychiatric services, because of widespread abuse,'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''So much of what they are doing could be moved to an out-patient basis.''

One method for minimizing hospitalization is a process known as case management. Service companies like Dr. Kessler's keep track of each mental-health claim. The case managers, who usually are psychiatric social workers or nurse clinical specialists, advise physicians about alternatives to hospitalization, which may cost $4,000 per patient.
