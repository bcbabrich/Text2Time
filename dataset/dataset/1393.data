They call them “cowboys of the sky.” This Sunday’s New York Times Magazine features a series of images by Damon Winter, who spent five days in July with the ironworkers who are rebuilding the Manhattan skyline atop 1 World Trade Center. On Thursday, the magazine published Mr. Winter’s photographs online in a slide show and an accompanying video, which also appears at the end of this post. They also wrote about the project on their blog, The 6th Floor.



James Estrin asked Mr. Winter to tell him about the assignment. Kerri MacDonald edited and condensed their conversation.

Q.

So tell me, most importantly: Are you scared of heights?

A.

No, I’m not scared of heights at all, fortunately.

Q.

How did they let you up there? How did this come about?

A.

Apparently it was a pretty long process getting the access. This is the derrick floor of the construction, which is the uppermost floor they’re working on at any given time. They haven’t let a lot of people up there. The magazine has worked on getting permission for months. Once they finally did, we locked in five days in the months leading up to the 10-year anniversary on Sept. 11. In order to be able to go up there, I had to do three days of safety training, which included one day of fall protection, where I learned how to use a harness.

Q.

You were in a harness?

A.

Yeah. I was never out walking on beams or anything. They draw the line at that. But to get on some of the walkways and the platforms, which would be 30, 40 feet above the derrick floor. I would have to tie in to my harness and tie off on a beam or something sturdy.

Q.

How many hours were you up there?

A.

I’d usually leave the house at 5 a.m., and I’d get home at 6 p.m. So I’d be up there from about 7 until 4, 4:30.

Q.

Did it rain any day?

A.

No. It was almost better if it was completely clear or completely overcast. The scattered clouds make it really difficult. On the first days, it was better for me to be up high, shooting down on them. I could take advantage of the views. As the cocoon came up, I went down, to shoot up. To shoot some of the more graphic stuff.

I love graphic images. It’s nice to be able to take your time, to really try to refine an image. I probably shot the same image over and over and over again.

Q.

Well, that’s how you make it right. What was it like being up there?

A.

It was amazing. I think the first day I was up there I just thought to myself, “This assignment is perfectly suited for me.” It’s an amazing view and the construction is fascinating. To see what these guys are doing is fascinating. It was very visual. The setting was amazing. It was perfect.

Q.

What does it feel like to be up that high, open? Without walls around you?

A.

It’s not scary at all. The only time that you’re actually exposed to the drop is when you’re going up, and there’s one staircase that’s attached to the outside of the building. You can look directly below and look down 70 stories, straight down to the ground. It’s like being in a glass-bottomed boat — it’s a view you don’t ever get. But they generally restrict us to the interior of the construction. Occasionally, they’ll let us get close to the edge, but they’re pretty tight. There’s a lot of activity on the floor and the floor boss is a really tough cookie. He runs a a tight ship.

Q.

What are the people who work up there like?

A.

Well, these are all the ironworkers. They have people responsible for the plumbing of the steel, which is basically the alignment; the leveling. They have people that are doing all the bolting, doing the welding. The connectors are actually at the top of the food chain for the ironworkers. The ironworkers themselves are sort of at the top of the construction food chain. This is the leading edge of the construction. It’s very important work that they’re doing. There are lots of Irish guys and, surprisingly, a lot of Mohawk Indians. There’s a history of Mohawk Native Americans working in ironwork.

Q.

They used to say they had better balance. They used to work without a harness.

A.

Right. I mean a lot of these guys have been working for generations. There are people there whose ancestors worked on the Brooklyn Bridge construction, and on Golden Gate construction. This is sort of an interesting site, too. For a lot of these guys, this is the first site that they’ve had that is completely protected. It has a cocoon around the outside so that every time they jump up a new set of floors, this netting comes up. There’s a very short window where they’re not protected.

Q.

Q.

And what did they make of you?

A.

It was funny. Up there, I felt like: “I’m on an embed. I’m totally on an embed.” After working on “A Year at War,” I found so many similarities. I’m wearing this really uncomfortable gear; I’m wearing this harness. I have 40 pounds of extra gear on me. And a hard hat. The guys are really tough, and they’re not used to having outsiders with them. So at first they’re really leery of you and they don’t want to talk to you. But just as in an embed, you stay there for a little while and you hang out and you show them that you’re not such a bad guy and you’re not there to write a horrible exposé about them, and they open up and they’re the nicest guys in the world.

But it’s run with that same kind of military precision.

Q.

Did any of these guys work on the original World Trade Center?

A.

The guys that do the plumbing of the steel, a lot of them had actually worked starting on the 12th of September doing cleanup. They’d been hauled in to help sort out some of the debris and figure out how to excavate these massive chunks of molten steel and iron.

Q.

How did they feel toward this building?

A.

So much time has elapsed. I myself was not really allowed to talk to them most of the time. The deal was that you have to be a fly on the wall, and you cannot talk to them at all. But we got to talk a little bit. One guy was telling me the story about the day after. He wasn’t terribly emotional about it, but I think he felt like it was important that his experience was sort of coming full circle.

Q.

What was the most surprising thing to you?

A.

I don’t think I knew exactly what to expect. It was more visual than I expected, actually. I went up there on a scouting trip a couple weeks ahead of actually shooting time, and I just felt, “This is so different from what the editors expect.” They had been showing me these old pictures of guys hanging out on the high beams, having their lunch out of metal lunch pails and sort of freewheeling, tiptoeing across beams. It’s not like that anymore. They have years and years of safety regulations that they’ve implemented. It just doesn’t look as sexy as it once did, when it was a lot more dangerous.

But when I got up there, there were pictures everywhere. It was a really fascinating scene. It’s really graphic to watch this lattice of steel go up as if it were a spider web or something. Each one of these beams weighs thousands and thousands of pounds. To see these guys handle them is amazing.

Q.

So, why did you shoot black and white?

A.

We discussed it from the beginning. Ninety-five percent of the time, I think it was absolutely the correct decision. Part of it is like what I said before. They want to reference these old iconic pictures of the steelworkers that we remember hanging over New York City’s cityscapes. And for purely logistical reasons, when you’re shooting throughout the course of a eight- or nine-hour day on top of a building, it’s really harsh light. It’s a lot easier to make really graphic images. The color muddies things up.

Q.

You were comparing this to an embed. But interestingly enough, you ended up in Afghanistan because of what happened on that spot. Did that cross your mind? You don’t connect the two events?

A.

Not really. The working situation felt remarkably like an embed. They’re a very specialized group of workers. They’re not really used to having a lot of attention.

Q.

Do you remember how you felt when you got up there the first time?

A.

It was like the ultimate fly-on-the-wall assignment. I was sort of prohibited from talking to the guys. And they knew it. They’d always try to talk to me. But I really got to see them work. I got to stand by and there was sort of no pretense about it. I really got to see what was happening. To me it was incredibly amazing work.

Being a guy who puts together Ikea furniture on occasion, to see them put together this Lego set on a massive, massive scale was really incredible.They’re putting together all these pieces that will eventually become one of the tallest structures in the city, and one that has real historic significance. It felt pretty amazing to witness that from the inside.

Q.

Now if only your 4-year-old self could have been there.

A.

Right, right. But I was seriously thinking about that because they’re putting together these beams that are 30 feet long, 40 feet long. There is no room for error in these things. It’s floor by floor by floor by floor. Everything has to be perfect. That’s just incredible to me. Sometimes I can’t even get the doors to line up on a cabinet.

Q.

One last question. Did you think of Margaret Bourke-White and all those photos that we grew up on looking at, all those amazing construction photos?

A.

I definitely had that pressure bearing down on me. But I knew that that sort of time had passed and that these were going to be something different. I try not to go into assignments with too many expectations about what I’m going to come out with. Inevitably, you will be disappointed. So I think I went in with low expectations, and came out sort of pleasantly surprised that it was really a sort of wonderful situation. There was a lot for me to pay attention to, and to sort through over the course of the day.
