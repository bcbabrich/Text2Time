TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — I thought this one was wheelie interesting. I’m sorry, I’ll try again: I never once grew tired of doing Ethan Cooper’s puzzle. Darn it, it’s only the first paragraph and already I’m stealing all of your puns. I’m not worried, though; I know you’ll come up with at least a few of your own.

Mr. Cooper’s puzzle does not have a punny theme, but it SPOKE to me (sorry, it’s hard to stop once you get started.) All three of the theme entries plus the payoff at 48 Across make their debuts today, giving a sense of freshness to a “parts of these phrases are components of the payoff” theme that we’ve all seen before.

I hinted in Sunday’s post that I have had a somewhat mercurial relationship with my car, and at least some of that is because of the spontaneous flat tires that it tends to have. My personal opinion on this automotive quirk is that the car is telling me that it likes the particular destination we’ve arrived at and doesn’t want to leave. This is why I am obsessive about keeping up my AAA membership. It is no fun trying to drive home on one’s RIMSKY-KORSAKOVs.

In nontheme news, I liked the entries SUCKED UP, CREW CUTS and HOT MIKES. Just one question: UNRIP? I don’t see that as “Tear open” as much as “quickly reseal something you’ve already torn open,” but maybe that’s just me.

Feeling puzzle weary this early in the solving week? Surely you JEST. But don’t call me Shirley.

Your thoughts?
