A person close to Drexel said the plan, as it now stands, calls for high-paid employees to receive 15 percent of their total compensation in the form of the convertible preferred stock. The dividends on the securities are paid in kind; rather than being given cash, the holder receives more shares of the convertible preferred.

This person said that high-paid employees who have already received more than 85 percent of their 1989 compensation will be asked to return cash to Drexel in exchange for the preferred stock. If they do not, their 1990 pay will consist of the securities until the 15 percent sum is reached.

People on Wall Street said this may be the first time a firm is demanding that some employees pay it at Christmastime rather than the other way around.

Steven Anreder, the Drexel spokesman, said: ''We've been highly pleased by the reaction we've gotten to date. The impression I'm getting from most people is this is something that makes sense and in this environment is understandable.''

Mr. Anreder also said Drexel had decided to make this a continuing part of compensation. He said there were ample precedents for the plan. ''This is not different than the old partnerships down on Wall Street where people kept most of their capital in,'' he said.

Other Wall Street firms have disclosed similar plans or are said to be considering them, with one crucial difference: their plans are optional.

Goldman, Sachs & Company, for example, recently introduced a voluntary ''profit participation'' plan in which certain professionals below the level of partner can designate up to 30 percent of their compensation to be invested in Goldman.

Bankers and traders on Wall Street said they would be distressed if their firms required them to invest their bonuses in the business, especially if the business is, like Drexel, privately owned.
