A commander of the rebels seeking the overthrow of the Nicaraguan Government has deserted his forces and flown to Mexico in hopes of returning to Nicaragua, according to Mexican, Honduran and rebel officials.

The commander, Jose Efren Mondragon, is believed to be the most senior rebel official to desert the guerrillas and seek to return to Nicaragua.

After delaying for six weeks, Honduras granted safe passage to Mr. Mondragon, who had taken refuge in the Mexican Embassy here.

Mr. Mondragon flew to Mexico this morning. He has said he wants to accept an amnesty offered to rebels by the Nicaraguan Government, according to a Mexican Foreign Ministry spokesman, Agustin Gutierrez Canet. The Mexican Embassy here refused to allow a reporter to meet Mr. Mondragon.
