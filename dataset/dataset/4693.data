THE 64 players in the Mikhail Tal Memorial Tournament in Moscow in early September had their work cut out for them: how to properly honor the late world champion, the Wizard of Riga, who left a legacy of such brilliant, imaginative games?

They did their best and seemed to have been inspired to produce a greater number of incisive attacks than usual.

In this nine-round Swiss-system competition loaded with grandmasters, three of them tied for first place, Sergei Makarichev, Nukhim Rashkovsky and Mikhail Krasenkov, all of Russia. Each got a $6,160 share of the prize fund.

Krasenkov blasted Evgeny Sveshnikov in a pretty good imitation of Tal-style brevity, winning in 23 moves.
