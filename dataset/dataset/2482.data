But by making Mr. Humeston's testimony an issue, Ms. Sullivan has taken some of the jury's attention off internal Merck e-mail messages and documents that show that company scientists were concerned about Vioxx's heart risks before sales began. And jurors appeared to be paying close attention to Ms. Sullivan's argument that Mr. Humeston's testimony about his Vioxx use was implausible.

Mr. Humeston had chronic pain in his left knee because of an injury he suffered in the Vietnam War, and he took many different pain medications. In May 2001, almost four months before his heart attack, he filled a 30-pill prescription for Vioxx; in July, he filled a 20-pill prescription and received 6 sample pills from his doctor's office. Mr. Humeston had his heart attack on Sept. 18, 2001, well after he would have run out of Vioxx if he had used his prescriptions as soon as he filled them.

In his testimony, Mr. Humeston told jurors that he had indeed taken Vioxx in the days leading up to his heart attack. He said he took only two Vioxx doses in May before deciding that the drug did not work and saving the other pills. He then used both the May and July prescriptions after filling the July prescription, he said.

Ms. Sullivan said she found that explanation implausible. "Why do you get a new prescription of something you know doesn't work for you?" she said to the jury.

She also noted that an investigator for the post office had secretly videotaped Mr. Humeston in July 2001 to find out whether his knee injury had disabled him as much as he contended. On Sept. 17, 2001, a day before Mr. Humeston's heart attack, the inspector told Mr. Humeston's doctor that he believed Mr. Humeston could do additional work at the post office.

"Mr. Humeston's stress added up to a heart attack," Ms. Sullivan asserted.

After a break for lunch, Ms. Sullivan closed her argument by discussing several animal and clinical trials of Vioxx, which she said proved that Merck had not tried to hide the drug's heart risks. She ended on a more informal note, asking the jury not to punish Merck because it works to improve health and cure disease.

That drew a rebuke from Judge Higbee, who has clashed with Ms. Sullivan throughout the trial. After dismissing the jury, Judge Higbee told Ms. Sullivan that her appeal was inappropriate.

"For some reason," the judge said, "you just don't see where the line is."
