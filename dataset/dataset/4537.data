Almost as quickly as a teakettle boils, the Celestial Seasonings herbal tea account has moved again.

Celestial Seasonings Inc. unexpectedly disclosed on Friday that the account, with billings of $6 million, had been shifted to Grey Advertising Inc. in New York from Tatham Euro RSCG in Chicago, where it had been for less than two months.

Renee Tilton, a spokeswoman for Celestial Seasonings in Boulder, Colo., declined to discuss why the company and Tatham had parted ways so suddenly or whether Tatham had been dismissed.

Grey and Tatham were among eight agencies that participated in a five-week review of the account, which was awarded to Tatham in early September. The other participants included Ally & Gargano in New York, which had handled the account for almost two years; Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago, and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore.
