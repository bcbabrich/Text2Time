To the Editor:

Re "Invite In the Rich? PEN Is Pondering" (Arts pages, Jan. 24): The measures being considered are more to attract expertise than money. Like many not-for-profits, we face a tightening budget. We retain foundation support and long-term support from the publishing industry.

Our concern is to strengthen our programs promoting freedom of the written word, literacy and literature. Hence the proposals to introduce nonmembers onto our board; they would bring breadth of experience, both financial and professional, and would be a resource for expanding our financial base.

You portray a board deeply divided. A preliminary poll on the proposed changes indicated that 80 percent of board members favor them. We are confident we have the imagination and experience to surmount our fiscal difficulties and to bring our work forward.
