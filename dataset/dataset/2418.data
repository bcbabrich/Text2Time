Several investors said yesterday that, despite some sharp ups and downs in performance, they were generally pleased with the returns.

"You have to keep in mind what they do and expect some volatility," said Mel Robertson, the chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees' Retirement System, which has $1.7 billion in assets and has been an investor with Amerindo since 1991. Mr. Robertson said he had not decided whether to withdraw Seattle's $23 million with Amerindo.

The city of Stamford had an average return of 11 percent on its investment with Amerindo since the end of 1994, a spokesman for the city said. Stamford made an initial investment of $5.5 million with Amerindo, "the majority of which has been cashed out," the spokesman said. The mayor is seeking "expert advice" to determine what to do with the assets that remain with Amerindo, he said.

Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar, which tracks investments, said investors in Amerindo's mutual fund may want to cut their losses rather than await a resolution of the case against Mr. Vilar and Mr. Tanaka.

The Amerindo Technology Fund has seen its assets dwindle to $98 million as of the end of April, from a peak of $598 million in 1999, a year when the fund returned almost 249 percent, according to Morningstar.

The technology fund's return fell 64.8 percent in 2000, and declined another 50.8 percent and 31.0 percent in 2001 and 2002. The fund rebounded the next two years, returning 85.1 percent and 23.8 percent in 2003 and 2004, but is down 22.4 percent through April of this year, according to Morningstar.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the independent directors of the mutual fund said they had "rescinded any authority" from Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Vilar "to give any instruction with respect to the fund or its assets," and had named Dana E. Smith, the fund's chief compliance officer, as the acting president of the fund.
