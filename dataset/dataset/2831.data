To the Editor:

I must respectfully disagree with David Brooks's Sept. 30 column. My dislike of President Bush has nothing to do with his person: it's his policies that I hate. I don't need firsthand knowledge of him to feel that his administration is taking the country in the wrong direction. And this feeling is not ''delicious,'' it's dreadful.
