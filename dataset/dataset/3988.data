There were reports out of Milan yesterday that Roberto Donadoni might play for Italy in the European Championship in June, but the MetroStars said the star midfielder would join the team for its game at Giants Stadium Saturday night against Tampa Bay.

The selection of the Italian team for the European Championship, which will be staged in England June 8-30, will be made May 12, after the completion of Italian League play. AC Milan, Donadoni's team, clinched the Italian title last Sunday and released Donadoni for MetroStars action.

Charlie Stillitano, the vice president and general manager of the MetroStars, said yesterday that his team would not stand in Donadoni's way if he were selected by Coach Arrigo Sacchi to play for the Italian national team.

"In the meantime, we're excited about this week end," he said. "We expect Roberto to energize our lineup."
