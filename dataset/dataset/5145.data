The National Labor Relations Board has ordered its regional offices to provide new training to employees who handle inquiries about workers' rights, a move stemming from a study by an anti-union group that said the board often provided inaccurate information.

William G. Stack, the board's acting associate general counsel, ordered the training in a memorandum earlier this month to the agency's field directors.

Mr. Stack also told the regional offices to determine whether board officers quoted in a recent report by the National Right to Work Committee had, in fact, provided the information attributed to them in the group's report.

Mr. Stack declined comment when asked whether the labor board agreed that some of its information officers had provided inaccurate information. But when asked why he had ordered new training, he said, ''Any time I find out that there is a need for training, the correct thing to do is see that the training is conducted.''
