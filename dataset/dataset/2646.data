This almost startlingly beautiful mini-survey of 40 paintings may be your best chance to be won over by On Kawara's austere, seemingly relentlessly repetitive notion of art.

On Jan. 6, 1966, he made a painting whose image was simply the date of its making -- spelled out in meticulous hard-edge sans serif letters on a monochrome ground; he tucked the front page of that day's New York Times into the back of its stretcher. Since then Mr. Kawara has repeated this ritual regularly and with very little variation. His canvases come in five sizes. The fields can be black, gray, red or blue. The language of the date and the newspaper front page vary according to the country in which he makes the painting.

This exhibition clarifies Mr. Kawara's unusual balance between the minimal and the conceptual, between matter and mind. His canvases sit on the wall as implacable as Donald Judd boxes; they are specific objects. But they also record equally specific points in time as it unfolds, one day after another, opening the mind to the unavoidable fact of existence that is not space. ROBERTA SMITH
