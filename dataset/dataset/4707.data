What is it with Presidents these days?

The first to fall to whatever afflicts them was George Bush. He seemed, at first, an unexceptional man in his habits of relaxation. He liked to fish a little, or play horseshoes or golf, or jog, or go out for Chinese food, or mess around in his boat.

Soon, though, it became clear that the President was a bit unusual. He liked to do all these things at the same time. It was said, wonderingly, that he was the most frenetic President the nation had ever seen.

But Bill Clinton may end up making George Bush look like a shut-in. A Relaxation a Minute

This week, the President-elect came here to rest and relax after grueling year of 16-hour workdays.

Here is what he did:

Day 1. Flew to Los Angeles. Stopped to shake hands at the airport. Visited Ronald Reagan for an hour. Posed for photographs. Stopped to talk to reporters. Spent two hours shaking hands, signing autographs and otherwise working through a crowd of 30,000 in a suburban shopping mall. Did a little shopping and tossed a football around in the mall. Drove to Summerland, next to Santa Barbara, to stay with his friends Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason at an oceanside estate.
