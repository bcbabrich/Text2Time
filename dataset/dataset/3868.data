Because of such moments, Valentine does not win much maneuvering room for himself, let alone many benefits of the doubt. The eyebrows stay an issue. The body language continues to be mulled like a human Rorschach test.

And as a result, the tiniest flaps with players, the kinds of flaps ignored in other clubhouses, will continue to set off alarms for the Mets as long as there is that Valentine ''thing.''

''That's not going to be my choice, and it's not going to be Bobby's choice,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager said, ''but anyone that has something in their past that had some confrontation attached -- it always comes into play whenever there is an issue that comes up. That's the easy thing to do with Bobby Valentine.''

It is also the always thing to do.

''He is aware of that and he has to be cognizant of that,'' the Mets owner Fred Wilpon said yesterday when asked about Valentine's thin margin for error.

This is the Mets' reality, theoretically through the year 2000. It is a lot of baggage, and it has already landed on the club twice in less than two weeks.

And though the Hundley and Harnisch episodes have not caused one Mets official to publicly second-guess Valentine's extended contract, the ease with which this baggage interrupts the norm cannot be denied.

For instance, the announcement of Valentine's contract extension on Wednesday was not allowed to stand on its own, but rather was questioned by reporters for its timing, because of the residue of the Hundley dispute.
