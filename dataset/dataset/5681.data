The entire work force of a Union Carbide petrochemical plant in Louisiana was evacuated yesterday after ethyl acetate, a liquid solvent, overheated in a storage tank, a company spokesman said.

According to the spokesman, there were no injuries and no toxic chemicals were released into the environment.

The evacuation of 400 workers at Union Carbide's plant at Taft, La., 20 miles southwest of New Orleans. was ''precautionary,'' said Freda Jeffries, the spokesman.

The accident followed an explosion and fire Tuesday in a different facility, the ethylene purification unit, of the same plant. There were no injuries in the Tuesday accident.
