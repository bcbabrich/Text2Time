A 19-year-old Norwegian turned in an impressive performance at the 17th European Team Championships in Serbia, which ended on Saturday. A Norwegian teenager had been expected to do well at the tournament, but the surprise was that he turned out to be Jon Ludvig Hammer and not Magnus Carlsen, who does not turn 19 until the end of November.

Carlsen, a prodigy who will be No. 2 in the world on the next list, was supposed to play for Norway, but he withdrew to spend more time preparing for the Tal Memorial tournament in Moscow, which begins on Nov. 5. Carlsen’s father, Henrik, explained that his son wanted to play in the team event, but after talking it over with his coach, Garry Kasparov, the former world champion, they decided it would be “too hectic.”

In the wake of Carlsen’s decision, Hammer, who is No. 240 among active players, became the leader of Norway’s team. He not only filled the void, he rose to the occasion.

After seven rounds, Hammer had four wins, three draws and no losses, and he had turned in the top performance at the tournament, which included nine of the world’s top 20 players.
