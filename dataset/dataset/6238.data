Mayor Lindsay yesterday announced a record capital budget of $2.448‐billion in which he stressed and interlocked public safety and the growing role of neighborhoods as his prime concerns.

The proposed capital budget, which is $630‐million more than the current one, contains for the first time a neighborhood section in which the Mayor got down to the smallest component of city life — the block. He urged that $5‐million be allocated to block associations and tenant groups to finance projects they might propose to fight crime in their communities.

“There can be no higher priority,” the Mayor said in the customary budget preface for the City Council and Board of Estimate, “than the safety of the city's citizens do their homes and on the streets of their neighborhoods.”

The emphasis on neighborhoods in the capital budget reflected the increasing attention the Mayor has been paying in recent months to communities, with frequent day‐long trips to neighborhoods in boroughs outside Manhattan.
