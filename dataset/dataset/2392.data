Paris If French women don't get fat, then why did Karl Lagerfeld publish a diet book? After 53 years in Paris, the German designer had racked up too many sausage-and-Gruyère breakfasts at Café de Flore to be able to wear Hedi Slimane's skinny suits. With the help of the chic diet doctor Jean-Claude Houdret, he shed more than 80 pounds in just over a year. The fashion world -- make that the world-world -- was so taken with the Kaiser's reedy new physique that he got a book deal and was talking to the sponsorship people at Pepsi Max (in France, sugar-free) before the lipo rumors could begin circulating.

This month the book is available in the States, from powerHouse. While the English translation is seamless, "The Karl Lagerfeld Diet" remains rooted in France, where cheese is good and gyms remain a novelty. Houdret allows up to two glasses of wine a day. ("But only red!" he told me. "It has natural chemical products that are good for the brain and circulation.") He also advocates fromage blanc and lobster, provides recipes for quail flambé and advises dieters to skip the gym, cautioning, "Exercise runs the risk of making you hungry." (Though, he writes, you can burn 130 calories an hour sewing, 280 playing piano and, vive la France, 260 shopping.)

But do the French really need it? Houdret says yes. "Until 1990, French women were still in the 19th century: they had a balanced diet, cooked at home, didn't eat fast food; le snacking didn't exist," says Houdret, a general practitioner who specializes in nutrition, aesthetics (read: advocate for plastic surgery) and homeopathy. "The modern socialization of women meant that they smoked, they drank. In short, they lived like the Americans. And so they gained weight like the Americans." But the French aren't as diet-crazed, explains Houdret, who sees American fad diets as "une catastrophe!"

Houdret's regime, known as the Spoonlight program, eliminates sugar, white flour, red meat and processed foods from a low-calorie but well-balanced diet: South Beach meets the Left Bank. Only a few foods are verboten, as listed on the colorful poster provided with the book (a photo of a stern Karl in one corner, Houdret with his "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" twirly mustache in another). Potatoes, Camembert, duck -- even horse meat -- are O.K., and you're allowed carte blanche when it comes to portion size.
