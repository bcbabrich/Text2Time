Four Americans who returned from Hanoi Sunday night with hundreds of letters from American prisoners of war described yesterday as overwhelming the destruction they had seen in the city as a result of United States bombing raids.

“Of course, we did not go originally to observe bombing; we went to take Christmas mail to prisoners of war and to bring back mail from them,” said Telford Taylor, professor of law at Columbia University, who was chief United States counsel for the prosecution at the Nuremberg war crimes trials. He said that the group had expected that peace would be announced during their visit to Hanoi.

The other members of the group, which was detained in Hanoi for more than a, week by the bombing, are Joan Baez, the folk singer; Michael Allen, associate dean of the Yale University Divinity School, and Barry Romo, a Vietnam veteran and national coordinator of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. They spoke at a news conference here in the office of the Committee of Liaison with Families of Servicemen Detained in North Vietnam, which sponsored the visit.

“The most horrible scene I've ever seen in my life was when we visited the residential area of Khan Thien and as far as could see, everything was destroyed,” Dean Allen said.
