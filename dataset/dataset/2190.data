New York Times to Launch ‘DealBook,’ New Financial News Report on the Web

NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–March 6, 2006–The New York Times announced today the launch of DealBook, a new online financial news report on NYTimes.com featuring up-to-the-minute news and exclusives about Wall Street and corporate America. The continually updated report edited by Andrew Ross Sorkin, the Times’s chief mergers and acquisitions reporter, with contributions from Times business reporters, is an extension of the daily e-mail newsletter of the same name that reaches more than 160,000 subscribers and includes among its readers many of the nation’s most influential executives and leaders.

DealBook now includes three separate entities: the DealBook online report, the DealBook e-mail newsletter and the DealBook Sunday column in the newspaper. The new online report will be published weekdays at NYTimes.com/dealbook and will contain in-depth coverage that is updated throughout the market day, Monday through Friday. The existing DealBook e-mail newsletter is an executive summary of the prior day’s news and sent before the opening bell each weekday morning. Mr. Sorkin’s DealBook column in the Sunday paper is a point-of-view piece on a specific topic or trend in the financial news industry.

In addition to breaking news and providing timely analysis of market-moving events, the DealBook online report will offer links to the most relevant financial news from around the Web. The report will feature dispatches from other Times business reporters including Peter Edmonston and Liza Klaussmann and will be overseen by a group of editors that includes Jeffrey Cane and is led by Business editor Lawrence Ingrassia.

“Like most folks on Wall Street and in corporate America, I spend an inordinate amount of time chasing down leads and trying to keep up with the constant onslaught of financial news,” Mr. Sorkin said. “DealBook brings together all of the most important and relevant news in one place, with the sensibility of a busy executive in mind.”

NYTimes.com/dealbook will cover vital subjects that are reshaping the corporate landscape today: mergers and acquisitions, private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, I.P.O.’s, investment banking and the legal and regulatory issues that permeate every facet of business. Users will be able to search the site by news topics and by specific industries.

“The DealBook newsletter, which started in 2001, has gained a loyal and growing readership. This new service takes it to the next level,” said Leonard M. Apcar, editor in chief of NYTimes.com. “This is a dynamic new way for Wall Street power players to get the news they need to compete in today’s tough marketplace.”

The NYTimes.com/dealbook service and the newsletter are available to readers free of charge when they sign up online.

Mr. Sorkin, who founded DealBook, has covered mergers and acquisitions for The New York Times since 1999. He has broken news of major mergers and acquisitions in the pages of The Times and on NYTimes.com. He has also spearheaded The Times’s coverage of Vodafone’s $183 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann, resulting in the world’s largest takeover. With a group of his colleagues he won a Gerald Loeb award last year for breaking the news of I.B.M.’s historic sale of its PC business to Lenovo. He was also a Loeb finalist last year in the commentary category for the DealBook column.

The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT), a leading media company with 2005 revenues of $3.4 billion, includes The New York Times, the International Herald Tribune, The Boston Globe, 15 other daily newspapers, nine network-affiliated television stations, two New York City radio stations and 35 Web sites, including NYTimes.com, Boston.com and About.com.
