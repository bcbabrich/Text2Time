To the Editor:

Re ''Hell Hath No Fury Like a Conservative Who Is Victorious,'' by Adam Cohen (Editorial Observer, Nov. 24), about the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala:

The reason these people are so mad is that they haven't won, and they know it. The right wing lost the culture wars sometime back in the 1990's. This is their real goal, and winning a couple of elections isn't going to change matters. The truth has slowly sunk in: we aren't going back to the 1950's after all.
