Mr. Clinton said that the food stamp cuts and the restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants had ''nothing to do with welfare reform'' and were simply intended to help balance the Federal budget. Republicans said that these provisions accounted for 75 percent of the $55 billion in savings projected under the bill in the next six years.

Mr. Clinton's likely opponent in this year's Presidential race, Bob Dole, commended Mr. Clinton for ''finally climbing on board the Dole welfare reform proposal,'' but said the President had ''stymied every attempt to pass meaningful welfare reform'' until now. Mr. Dole has repeatedly denounced Mr. Clinton's earlier vetoes, saying they showed that he had abandoned his 1992 campaign promise to ''end welfare as we know it.''

Welfare has been a major issue in this year's Presidential campaign, and Republicans were ready to pounce on the President if he vetoed the new welfare bill.

Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said today, ''Welfare reform would never have happened without the Republican Congress.'' Mr. Barbour asserted that the President had been forced to sign the bill ''rather than risk his re-election.''

Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who has studied welfare policy for decades and led opposition to the bill, said: ''The President has made his decision. Let us hope that it is for the best.'' In an interview just before the President spoke, Mr. Moynihan said: ''The Cabinet is against the bill. The pollsters are for it. This is a defining event in his Presidency.''

Among the Democrats dismayed by Mr. Clinton's decision was Representative John Lewis of Georgia. Just before the House approved the bill, Mr. Lewis addressed the chamber in anguished tones. ''Where is the compassion?'' he asked. ''Where is the sense of decency? Where is the heart of this Congress? This bill is mean. It is base. It is downright lowdown. What does it profit a great nation to conquer the world, only to lose its soul?''

But Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, summarized the case for the bill this way: ''People are not entitled to anything but opportunity. You can't be on welfare for generations.''
