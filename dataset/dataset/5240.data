Bo Schembechler, the Michigan football coach, yesterday rejected an offer to become the school's athletic director, electing to remain in the job he has held since 1969. Michigan is trying to replacem Don Canham, who has announced plans to retire.

''I'm a football coach first,'' said Schembechler. ''Since the job did not include football after the 1988 season, I have decided to turn down the athletic director's position.''
