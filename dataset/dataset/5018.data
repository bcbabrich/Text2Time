WHEN she was in law school, Kimberly K. Wheeler drew up a business plan for a children's art gallery. After graduating,Ms. Wheeler was interviewed by 19 investment banks but decided to start her fantasy business instead.

Eleven months ago she opened the Kimberly Gallery in the SoHo section of Manhattan, which she says is New York's only art gallery for children. "I specialize in alternative art forms for children, as well as in children's book illustrations," she said.

The gallery carries two lines of children's furniture. Each piece of Tracey Belfatto's multi-functional furniture incorporates a blackboard and an abacus. Rob Johnson's line is high-tech: all glass and black steel. "It's very much for the SoHo baby," Ms. Wheeler said.

There are some wonderful small items, including, at near right, an early 1900's illustration by Arthur Rackham ($140), and, at far right, a hand-painted giraffe ($130) and a rabbit clock ($120).
