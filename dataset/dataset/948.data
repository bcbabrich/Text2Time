Dick Cavett on his career in show business, and more.

Well, here we are again. Oscar has come and gone.

Words to gladden the heart. E’en so, fair warning. This will be about Oscar. I won’t be hurt if you decide to read something else.

My problem with Oscar always begins with the first utterance of those dread words, “I’d like to thank….” My hands involuntarily reach for the Bayer bottle and a Tum.

When they come to their senses and make me commissar of the Oscar show, I promise you this: anyone uttering those brain-numbing words and attempting to thank more than three people will be instantly dropped through a trapdoor.

It will be well-padded down below. No one wants anyone to get hurt.



There’ll be coffee down there, and magazines. But there will be no egress from the nice and comfortable subterranean chamber until the show has faded from the screen. No reclaiming the stage, clutching what looks like a toilet-paper roll of “thank-you’s.”

Why was this fungus allowed to creep all over what used to be a lot of fun to watch?

Get ready to Google or iPad or whatever, young folks, but there was a time before Oscar became the Festival of Thanks, when a man who went by the name Bob Hope delivered such gems as, “Well, here we are again at Oscar Night. Or as it’s known at my house, Passover.”

I’m not sure I’ve recovered fully from the night the divine Julia Roberts seemed to thank all but four people in the Los Angeles phone book. They got halfway through Beethoven’s Fifth, trying to play her off.

The same question arises about Oscar that I ask myself every year about the Bowl that is allegedly Super. Why do I watch it? (O.K., this year’s game was good.)

I really need to know why we inflict such self-punishment on ourselves.

Can I say nothing nice about old Osky? I can. They do, in one area at least, seem to have given me less and less reason to mutter aloud, “Will they never learn?” I’m talking about those dreadful, invariably bombing two-person “comedy” bits that, over the years, they’ve saddled the presenters with. They are blessedly fewer, but still.

You know the ones I mean.

“Hi, Jan. Say, that’s some dress you’re wearing.” (Delivered while staring straight out front by a guy who seems to be wearing a tux for the first time. And welded to the prompter, which always seems to be a yard too far away. The dialogue is of pure wood.)

Jan: “Oh, thanks, Tom. I’m so glad you care for my dress, as I made it myself at my home.”

Tom: Wow. (Delivered without emphasis or energy.) Well, I sure hope you make it home still in it. (Strangled mercy-laugh.)

I’m sorry. My made-up example is far, far too funny to be typical of the genre, but you know what I mean.

And I’m sorry to say that some very good actors, when dipping a first-time toe into comedy, need to be given, as foreign actors do, “line readings.” In order, that is, to prevent the “That was no lady, that was MY wife” problem.

How old an oldie must you have to be to remember that there was a time before innocent awards viewers, just looking for a little fun, were subjected to these paralyzing paroxysms of imaginary gratitude?

Imaginary, I say, because what is it all really saying?

It’s saying. “I really don’t deserve this award. No, no. It’s not for me at all. Not at all. It really belongs to a lot of people…”

Like hell. You gave the performance, they didn’t. The false modesty is thick and of high viscosity.

Here’s the kind of thing you endure. Effusions of thanks and salivating affection for such household names as:

Henny Goldfarb. And Janey Dillman … and Clyde Whale. … and Sneed Hearn … and Tomm, my best buddy… and the incredible Eldridge Endrubber … and, of course, Alvira Winkle … and dear, dear Conchita for, well, just about everything … and the girls in the Huppman office, and darling “Chummy…” you know who you are. Oh, and Andre, my masseur [oddly, pronounced “massooss”] … oh, and at the Morris Agency, Schmul Yamazaki … and Cheech Bolander, my neighbor who never fails to, like, water my plants, oh, and Floyd for, well, just for being Floyd … and for undying affection when I need it most, dearest Pootie and Tootie, my two Shih Tzus … and of course a very special Mom.. and Dearest Dad, who I know is looking down on us right now [from where, up in the flies?] and, oh, don’t play me off, I’ve got one more list somewhere here. Ah, yes, and … [a shot rings out] …

A fantasy? An exaggeration? Just ask yourself.

A radical idea I know, but couldn’t Sneed and Eldridge and that whole lot be thanked off-camera, with a nice note and maybe a modest gift or two? A caringly wrapped case of Tootsie Rolls and some nice hollyhocks?

Here is a typical Oscar “thank you” from the good old days, an artifact from a far-off, happier time before it occurred to anyone to bore us to idiocy with a list of unheard of strangers. Somewhere on the Net I found an acceptance speech by the great David Niven. It went:

“And the winner is … DAVID NIVEN!” (Affectionate ovation.)

Niven: “Thank you. I’m so weighed down with good luck amulets and charms from friends that I was barely able to struggle my way up here onto the stage. I’m very grateful.” (EXITS)

Where are the Nivens of yesteryear?

A shame, in a way, that he didn’t say more, because I recall Niven as a scintillating guest on an early show of mine. His talk simply sparkled and was compared favorably — presumably by some rather elderly people — to that of Oscar Wilde.

Nobody that year read a gratitude laundry list. Though a helpful friend reminds me that Greer Garson, in 1943, established the all-time record for speech length. When she got home, two of her children had grown up during it.

I confess I still retain some affection for Oscar. I know the reviews weren’t very good this year and I know it’s easy to kick Oscar when he’s down.

But then when is he up?
