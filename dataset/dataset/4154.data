Not since Erik Bruhn in the 1960's has the role of Albrecht been refined to such a noble essence. Anyone who saw had seen the Bolshoi-trained Mr. Malakhov in 1988 when he appeared with the Moscow Classical Ballet in Boston might have wondered how he would apply his flamboyant virtuosity to "Giselle." His debut with Ballet Theater in "Les Sylphides" last week showed his lyrical side, and any fears that his youthful mannerisms might not be under control were dispelled by his stunning and artistically mature performance in "Giselle."

Matched superbly with Ms. McKerrow, who danced flawlessly and omitted no step, he stayed within the production's guidelines and yet imposed his own style upon his role. Mr. Malakhov's long line and classical placement give off a princely image; his commanding presence was sensed from the start and he ordered Hilarion, his rival, out with a glance.

As a dancer, his perfect lines are not always matched with clean finishes in his air turns. But his extraordinary soft landings and high leaps were combined with some heart-stopping moments: the way he spiraled to the ground when Albrecht was exhausted, and kept his hand to his heart while he flew across the stage in a series of leg beats.

Ms. McKerrow has still to deepen her mad scene in Act I, but her dancing has a vividness and classical style that provides a great deal of depth. Less exotic than Mr. Malakhov, who seemed in his own world, she nonetheless met him on his elevated ground.

It was a fine cast. Steven Hyde's Hilarion effectively sketched out a portrait of a good man turned cynic. Keith Roberts and Sandra Brown, typed often as contemporary dancers, actually offered the best peasant pas de deux of the weekend. Mr. Roberts was always precise and Ms. Brown was full of verve. Christine Dunham's Myrta had a beauty of elongated line.
