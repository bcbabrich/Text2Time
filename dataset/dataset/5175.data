A 70-year-old man suffered a fatal heart attack last night at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center during a performance of Verdi's ''La Traviata,'' officials said. The man, Samuel Weiss, of 351 East 84th Street, collapsed in his seat at 9:22 P.M. Mr. Weiss regained a pulse after several physicians in the audience administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation for about 20 minutes, officials said, but was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to Roosevelt Hospital.
