Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ramon Vazquez had two homers and seven runs batted in apiece for the Rangers. Amazingly, they were the team’s Nos. 8 and 9 hitters and finished the season with only 11 and eight homers.

“Tonight there were some balls thrown across the plate and we put them in play,” Manager Ron Washington told The Associated Press in the understatement of the century.

As for the Rangers’ bullpen, Wes Littleton came in for the final three innings, and earned … a save? Yes, in the rare cases when a pitcher finishes a game throwing three or more innings, he is eligible for a save, no matter what the game’s margin. Even Jose Reyes could probably have earned that one.

Horrifyingly, the O’s had to come back and play a second game of a doubleheader just after. They lost that one too, 9-7.
