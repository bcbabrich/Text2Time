SOMETIMES, desperation leads to inspiration. And the best response to a challenge is to throw food at it. Since the earliest days of the LP, a number of record companies keen to diversify have chipped away at the strangest market niche of them all: music to eat by.

Three years ago at Sony Classical records, a group of executives sat around a table and glumly contemplated the shrinking market for classical music. In the Ice-T age, what would it take to create some sizzle around Schubert?

The solution was Masterworks Dinner Classics, a series of compact disks and tapes matched to national cuisines and to specific eating scenarios, with suggested recipes as part of the package.

The marketing plan was simple. Style the art to suggest a food and entertaining magazine. Sign on Martha Stewart for the recipes. Place the disks and tapes in bookstores, right next to the cookbooks, and in specialty food stores and cookware stores.
