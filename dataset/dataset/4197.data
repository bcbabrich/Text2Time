The main thing is to do no harm. Angel Cordero has been warned by doctors that he could kill himself with one more fall if he comes out of retirement, but his athlete's grandiosity will not let him rest.

In tennis, the money is still there, as long as you can play a round or two in the Grand Slams. Bjorn Borg was in outer space and Ivan Lendl had back pain when they retired young. Pam Shriver keeps playing because she likes it. Garrison Jackson wasn't sure. She announced a few months ago that she and her husband, Willard Jackson, were going to start a family. She was going to work on her charities and sponsoring inner-city players in Houston.

The Open would be her last Grand Slam, she announced. She had been the player to dispatch Chris Evert into potential motherhood in 1989 at Flushing Meadows, and Evert had consoled her, rather than the other way around. Soon somebody would be giving Garrison Jackson a farewell hug. But then she began to second-guess herself with a vengeance.

"The biggest thing I did emotionally, I was just kind of wavering within myself about it, if I really wanted to give it up," Garrison Jackson said. "I think reality hit when people started calling and wanted to come down and do interviews in Houston before the Open, and I started getting very, very depressed because it is something I have been doing since I was 10 and I thought I could just give it up and walk away from it, and I still love the game."

Stuck with her announced retirement, Garrison Jackson found herself in locked rooms, "crying and crying and crying. Then the phone rings and it is Billie."

King, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals at both 38 and 39, told Garrison Jackson: "Zina, you have to make the decision. You can't go with what other people want you to do. You can't worry about the media. You can't worry about your husband, your family. You have to make that decision."

Garrison Jackson decided to come back next year. With her mind safely changed, she won her first match before a friendly crowd out on Court 173 the other night. The powers at the Open remembered that Garrison Jackson was a noble contender for more than a decade -- one of the most generous players on the tour -- and they put her in the stadium yesterday.
