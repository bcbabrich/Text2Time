The suffering of the Iraqi people cries out for compassion. Shortages of food, medicine, clean water and electricity now threaten to cause more death and disease than the Persian Gulf war. Indeed, the worsening plight of Iraq's vulnerable children and powerless adults virtually demands some easing of the economic sanctions. Why make the Iraqi people suffer for the crimes of Saddam Hussein?

But the sanctions remain one of the few levers by which the allied coalition hopes to disarm Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities. As Iraq disdainfully evades international inspectors, the allies know they need every bit of pressure they can muster.

There may be a way out of this dilemma: Permit Iraq to resume oil exports, but impound the earnings and apply some of them to humanitarian assistance.

Satellite photos and defectors' reports make clear that Iraq continues to violate the terms of the United Nations cease-fire. Iraq supplied misleading accounts of its nuclear arms program and still tries to conceal arms-making equipment and facilities from international inspectors. As if to underscore reports that Washington is weighing military options, President Bush says "all means necessary" may be used to enforce the cease-fire resolution. But bombing during the war did not succeed in eliminating Saddam Hussein's nuclear capacity.
