After getting off to a typically rocky start in the non-conference portion of their schedule, the Siena Saints are now once again steamrolling through the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, winning all 12 league games to date by an average margin of 13.3 points.

As the wins pile up, it becomes more and more evident that Siena’s Class of 2010 will go down in the record books as the college’s most productive group.

The seniors Ronald Moore, Edwin Ubiles and Alex Franklin have been at the heart of Siena’s back-to-back M.A.A.C. regular-season and tournament titles, a feat never before accomplished in the program’s history. And they seem to be on target to make it three straight. With 6 more points by Moore, all will be 1,000-point scorers, and Moore is also on pace to become Siena’s career assists leader. Over four seasons, the class has won a program record-tying 89 games, including the last 32 in a row at home. (Franklin missed two of the wins as a sophomore and Ubiles has missed three this year due to injuries.)



Dubbed The Maestro and known best for his N.C.A.A. tournament heroics against Ohio State last March, Moore is the point guard who makes Siena’s offense sing.

“He is the best I’ve ever had at engineering victory,” Coach Fran McCaffery said after a recent game. “We’ve got a shot at 100 wins with him bringing it down. He just has an uncanny ability to know what we need to win.”

Ubiles is a silky smooth swingman who can make scoring look effortless.

“A pleasure to coach,” McCaffery said. “Great attitude. Great feel for the game. Plays multiple positions and just makes plays. The thing that he’s developed since he’s come here is the ability to play defense. Now he’s a lock-down defender on top of being a great offensive talent.”

Franklin is a versatile forward who McCaffery referred to as a ‘tweener.

“He’s a matchup nightmare, because he can dribble the ball and break the press,” he said. “He can shot-fake drive. He does have a mid-range jump shot. And then he’s an absolute beast on the glass and in the post area offensively. But he also has a great demeanor on the floor. He’s a phenomenal competitor without ever losing control of his emotions. I’ve never seen him come unglued.

“Same holds true for the other two as well. They just never come apart with their emotions. I think together they blend well if you look at their skill sets, but I think their personalities also blend well together.”

BUILDING A CLASS

The construction on the Class of 2010 began at a time when there was very little buzz surrounding Siena’s basketball program. McCaffery was hired in 2005 after the team had gone 6-24 the previous season. Players were in the process of transferring out or were pondering it. One thing McCaffery could offer recruits was playing time.

Ubiles, a Poughkeepsie native, was the first to commit, as Siena had actually targeted him prior to McCaffery’s arrival.

“Coach Mac came in and told me that he’s gonna turn the program around,” said Ubiles, noting that he had also been considering Seton Hall and Rhode Island. “After I came on my Siena visit, I didn’t even bother taking any other visits. I committed right after my visit and it was all because what he told me and he believed in me. I trusted him and he told me I was going to play right away. That’s all I really wanted to be able to do — go to a school where I was gonna be able to play and not have to play behind somebody or wait for somebody to leave.”

McCaffery was thrilled to get such a heavily recruited player.

“We felt like when we signed him, O.K., now we may have turned the corner with a player who has a chance to be special,” he said.

Next came Franklin, a Pennsylvania native and the cousin of the former N.B.A. player Donyell Marshall.

“Coach told me that I was going to come in and contribute right away, and that was big,” said Franklin, who also had interest from La Salle and Virginia Commonwealth, among others. “He let me know that he was turning the program around and I’d be a major impact in doing that.”

Moore, another Pennsylvania product whose brother Chuck played at Seton Hall and Vanderbilt, was the last to commit.

“I decided to make my decision in late December, and it was mainly I just heard so much stuff about Fran,” said Moore, who had drawn interest primarily from smaller programs. “I could come in right away and play.”

What’s ironic is that while many now consider Moore the most indispensable of the three, he was the easiest to land.

“His recruiting story was interesting because he didn’t have a lot of interest,” from other schools, McCaffery recalled.

He originally had not planned to recruit a point guard in the class, before he got an e-mail message from Moore’s high school coach.

“I told his coach I’d be coming down to take a peek at him and then I did,” he said. “We offered him; he visited a week later and he committed. So he was one of the easier recruits we’ve ever had.”

The Siena radio analyst and former player Tom Huerter thinks the Class of 2009 star Kenny Hasbrouck should also be mentioned as a key to building the Class of 2010.

“He was the first to believe in Fran and then the other guys fell into place,” Huerter said. “If Fran doesn’t have Kenny — Edwin, Alex and Ronald — all three of them don’t come. Definitely not Edwin and Alex. Ronald may because he was a late recruit and he wasn’t as highly recruited, but Edwin and Alex don’t come unless you have a player like Kenny Hasbrouck.”

THE BEST EVER?

At least three recruiting classes previous to 2010 might be mentioned in any debate about Siena’s best ever, although only two of them merit serious consideration.

The most recent is the Class of 2002. Prior to last March, that was the lone class to play in two N.C.A.A. tournaments. However, the team that made the second trip had a losing record, and the only player of any real note in the class was Dwayne Archbold. No one could strongly argue it stacks up with the Class of 2010.

Huerter is well acquainted with Siena’s recruiting classes since the late 1980s and agreed to make class comparisons.

“Dwayne was a great player,” Huerter said. “Tough kid from the city; loved him. He was a gamer and I think from that class to this senior class, he was the toughest kid in the bunch, but with Edwin being equally as skilled, putting up bigger numbers and having more wins in his career, the difference maker to me is that you throw in Ronald Moore and Alex Franklin. I would say this class, 2010, is better than that class, 2002.”

A more formidable challenger would be the Class of 2000, the only previous class with three 1,000-point scorers in Marcus Faison, Jim Cantamessa and Corey Osinski. In tandem with the Class of 2002, they too won back-to-back M.A.A.C. regular-season crowns, but in the second of those years did not cap it off with a tournament title, and had to settle for an appearance in the N.I.T. Nor did they ever win a game in the N.C.A.A. tournament — let alone the two won so far by the Class of 2010. One thing 2000’s class does have in its favor is the program’s only player to lead the nation in a major statistical category. Cantamessa sported the country’s best 3-point shooting percentage in 1997-98. But with Moore currently leading the nation in assists per game, that advantage may soon disappear.

“I think athletically, this class is far better,” Huerter said in referring to the Class of 2010 relative to the Class of 2000. “I think that class played in the right system under Paul Hewitt. They were in great shape and they would just keep shooting until their arms fell off. I don’t think they were considered a strong defensive team because of the points per game they gave up, but they were strong enough in that they outscored you. But again, I would give the nod to this team because of the wins. You just have to look at the victories.”

From that perspective, the toughest challenger would have to be the Class of 1991. This group included the point guard deluxe Marc Brown, Siena’s career leader in points, assists and victories, who is almost universally regarded as the best player in Saints history. Brown led Siena to three regular-season league titles, the college’s first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament appearance and win in 1989, and its first N.I.T. victories in 1991. The class also featured a couple of solid role players in Steve Downey and Huerter himself, and won its first 26 home games — a record before it was surpassed this season, thanks largely to the Class of 2010.

So who’s better?

“From a potential standpoint, Class of ’91,” Huerter said. “Steve Downey had more potential than any player in Siena history, and I will say that going back to the ‘50s, ‘60s, even though I didn’t see a lot of those guys. And then you add in Marc Brown who was our career leading scorer.

“That was also a different time period. When we were beating teams, we were beating teams with senior All-Americans. We were competing against a La Salle program that had three N.B.A. players on their team. You didn’t have kids jumping out of high school to go to the N.B.A. You didn’t have underclassmen leaving after one or two years. You had developed 22-, 23-year-old men that we were playing against.

“It’s a good argument. I will be biased and be honest and say I think the Class of ’91 was better, but I would say that this class would be just a half step behind. But at the end of the season, if this team goes to the N.C.A.A. tournament again, I may give them the nod because it still comes down to winning and they’ve been able to do that on the biggest stage.”

How about a second opinion, hypothetically pitting the players from each class against each other head to head?

“It’s a different era. You never know,” said Brown, who is now the head coach at New Jersey City University. “Tom would have a little trouble guarding Ubiles because he’s creative with the ball, but Tom’s toughest, and Ubiles would have definitely had to go outside and defend Tom’s jump shot. Steve Downey — Franklin couldn’t guard Steve Downey, he’s a 7-footer. He’s a tough kid, but he’s too undersized. And Moore would be in trouble. That’s all I have to say.”

That’s all? Nothing more on Moore?

“He’s a good player,” Brown said. “I love the way he pushes the ball, and he really controls the game.”

FEBRUARY AND MARCH

There’s still a lot more the Class of 2010 can accomplish in its final two months.

With Siena currently on a national-best 13-game winning streak, a triumph Friday against Iona would tie the program’s Division I record for most consecutive wins, set during the 1988-89 season. Whenever the next victory comes, the college’s modern record for most wins over a four-year period will be broken, at 90. Reaching the 100 wins McCaffery mentioned will be difficult, but it’s not out of the question.

Later this month, the Saints will play in the marquee BracketBusters matchup at Butler, where a win could potentially do wonders for the team’s N.C.A.A. tournament seeding and perhaps even assure an at-large bid, should one be needed.

Individually, Moore is a virtual lock to break Brown’s career assist record, and top his own single-season mark set last year in the process. Ubiles could join Brown and Doremus Bennerman as Siena’s third 2,000-point scorer, although that has become less likely with Ubiles missing games due to injury.

In March, the Saints will try to parlay their home dominance into a third straight M.A.A.C. tournament championship in Albany, where it will not return for at least five years.

Should that effort prove successful, Siena could then take aim at its first ever N.C.A.A. Round of 16 appearance — an achievement that would justify the preseason hype.

Stay tuned.

The bonus: Haven’t had enough class comparisons? No problem. Two more from the “coulda been” category coming right up.

From a sheer talent standpoint, the Class of 2008 ranked with the Class of 2010, but Siena got little return on it due to a rash of transfers. Al Fisher and Jack McClinton played one year at Siena before leaving when the former coach Rob Lanier was fired. Fisher went on to become Mid-American Conference player of the year in his junior season at Kent State, while McClinton became a two-time first-team all-A.C.C. player at Miami. Kojo Mensah played two years with the Saints before departing under bizarre circumstances. He resurfaced at Duquesne, where he was a victim in a shooting incident and declared for the N.B.A. draft after his junior season. The only player from the class to finish his career at Siena was the 3-point specialist Tay Fisher, who was a star in the 2008 M.A.A.C. tournament championship game and now plays with the Harlem Globetrotters.

“It was a very talented class,” Huerter said of the four guards, “but I think they would have bumped into each other too much to ever really reach the full potential of a team. I think Kojo and Jack had to have the ball in their hands all the time to be successful. They were not guys who could play off the ball as well. Al Fisher was the same way. They all made plays with the ball. It would have been very difficult to find enough basketballs in that lineup. That class would definitely be a big step below. I think, talent-wise, individually they were very good, but collectively they would never have the success.”

The Class of 1989 was another highly-skilled group that suffered significant losses. Dwight Walton played just one season before he was lost due to eligibility issues, and the high-scoring guard Rick Williams was dismissed from the team after three seasons. Even so, Siena’s career blocks leader, Monty Henderson, and the 1,000-point scorer and rebounder extraordinaire Steve McCoy did play four full years, capping them off with the 1989 N.C.A.A. tournament appearance.

“Those players had great potential,” said Huerter, who played with all but Walton. “They had some combinations. They didn’t bump into each other as much at the same position. All four of those guys could have played at the same time — add a Marc Brown as a point guard — that team wins a lot of games and would rival the victories that this senior class has and my senior class had. It’s just unfortunately Rick’s career was cut short and Dwight’s career was cut short.”

Because of an editing era, an earlier version referred to Siena as a university instead of a college.
