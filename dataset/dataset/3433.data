The Japanese Parliament passed a law in 1997 permitting doctors to remove organs from brain-dead patients, provided that consent is obtained beforehand, and compromised on the definition of death, saying that brain-dead patients would be considered dead only if they had specified that they wanted to donate their organs. But the law had not been applied until today's heart transplant, which is only the second in Japan's history.

Dr. Juro Wada performed the first 31 years ago in an ambiguous legal environment, and, when the recipient died, he was accused of murder. The furor deterred other doctors from attempting similar operations any transplants until the current law permitting transplants went into effect in October 1997.

In the years since, thousands of people have flown overseas to get transplants, or have simply died. Many others simply died because they could not afford surgical procedures abroad or could not get organs overseas in time.

Despite the new law, many people still wait in vain for transplants, because many Japanese remain reluctant to donate their organs. At least seven patients have died while on official waiting lists. In a survey released by the office of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, one-third of those asked said they would like to donate their organs. But only 2.6 percent of them had official donor cards.

In the first stage of today's operation, doctors at the Kochi Red Cross Hospital in western Japan removed the heart, liver and kidneys from the brain-dead patient, the nation's first legal organ donor, who was in a coma after suffering a stroke and a brain hemorrhage. Details about the donor, even sex and age, are being kept confidential until after the funeral at the request of the family.
