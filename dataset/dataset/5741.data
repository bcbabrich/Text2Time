Willis Reed driving to the basket, John Havlicek and Dave DeBusschere shooting jumpers, Wilt Chamberlain waiting to pass and Bob Cousy and Bob Pettit dribbling.

These are some of the images encased in 4-by-10 foot plexiglass panels at the new pro basketball Hall of Fame. But one panel had no picture, the one belonging to Dolph Schayes, the former Syracuse National star.

Today, at the dedication of the three-story, $11.5 million museum off Interstate 91, Danny Schayes, the Denver Nugget center, stood before that panel and read a plaque extolling the highlights of his father's career with the Nationals. He was approached by Paul Dietrich, the hall's architect.

''Maybe you can help me,'' said Deitrich. ''We're trying to find poses that depict what each Hall of Famer was best known for. I have about 20 photos of your dad, but none of him shooting his two-handed set shot.''
