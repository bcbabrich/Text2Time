After the hearing, prosecutors released a list of the items found in Mr. Duran's truck that provided insights into the world of a man known to his neighbors as Frank, a quiet, unobtrusive father of a 5-year-old boy. Some officials said they had begun to suspect that Mr. Duran might have been drawn to the ultraconservative, citizen militia movements that have sprung up in several Western states.

In a search of the truck early Sunday at the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, agents found eight compact disks, 31 cassette tapes, a dozen books, 4 newspapers and 9 magazines. None of the individual items were identified, but officials described the material as mix of New Age music tapes, occult literature and several pornographic magazines.

They also found camping gear, including extra clothing, two pairs of shoes, two sleeping bags, a black tarpaulin, compressed fuel packets, rope, tools, a fishing rod, a pair of medic's shears, a machete, a knife sharpener and a stuffed animal.

Agents also discovered weapons-related equipment, including a shotgun, a gun magazine, a gun bag, shotgun shells and 20-round boxes of ammunition for the rifle they said was used to shoot at the White House. They also recovered a shoulder holster, a gun-cleaning kit and four used targets. The agents also found 22 Atropine injectors, syringes filled with premeasured doses of medication used by soldiers as antidote to poison gas. They also found two units of what appeared to be a drug, and they were still trying to determine what it might be used for and whether Mr. Duran had taken it.

At the Pentagon today, officials released more details about Mr. Duran's troubled military career. He enlisted in the Army in February 1988 and was trained as a medic. For more than two years, he served as a battalion medic in the 25th Infantry Division based at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.

On Aug. 9, 1990, after a night of drinking at a bowling alley on post, Mr. Duran and a group of other soldiers began arguing with several civilians. When Mr. Duran got in his automobile to leave, the records show, he drove straight at the group of civilians, struck one woman and roared off. Later, he was stopped by military police, who charged him with drunken driving, aggravated assault, drunken and disorderly conduct and leaving the scene of accident.

It was for this incident that Mr. Duran was dishonorably discharged at court-martial and sentenced to five years at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. He served two and one-half years of his sentence, which was later suspended, and he was released on Sept. 3, 1993.
