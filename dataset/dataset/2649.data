Mount St. Helens in Washington has a 70 percent chance of a small eruption within the next month, geologists at the United States Geological Survey said. A swarm of small earthquakes, three to four a minute, continued to intensify, with some reaching magnitude of 3.3, indicating that magma is moving upward, but geologists do not foresee anything like the violent 1980 eruption that killed 57 people.
