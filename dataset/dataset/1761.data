Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Sara Krulwich/The New York Times The Broadway cast of “Billy Elliot the Musical” is about to lose another cast member who plays the title character — only this time it’s someone who has reached the age of majority. Stephen Hanna, the former New York City Ballet dancer who portrays the role of Billy’s older self in that musical, will rejoin the company of City Ballet as a guest artist for its coming 2009-2010 winter season. In a news release, City Ballet said on Thursday that Mr. Hanna, who departed for the Broadway show last year, will assume his former rank as principal dancer when he returns to the company. Mr. Hanna joined the corps of City Ballet in 1997; he was promoted to soloist in 2004 and made a principal dancer in 2005. A press representative for City Ballet said that Mr. Hanna would depart “Billy Elliot” at the end of October. A representative for the Broadway musical confirmed Mr. Hanna’s departure and said that a replacement for him had not yet been determined.
