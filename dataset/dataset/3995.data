Burstein's Latest Battle

During her unsuccessful race for state attorney general two years ago, Karen S. Burstein was celebrated and supported by virtually every Democratic official in Manhattan. But in the race she is now waging, for surrogate in Manhattan, she is challenging an incumbent who is not only popular with Democratic officials, but who also has been recommended by an independent judicial screening panel.

Hurry, Hurry, Step Right Up

Two sideshows will open across the street from each other at the corner of West 12th Street and Surf Avenue on Coney Island, the legendary peninsula where 300 midgets were once exhibited in a Lilliputian village and Edison electrocuted an elephant. One is Coney Island U.S.A., a full-fledged sideshow that has just moved to a new site after being evicted from the Boardwalk. The other is the International Circus Museum. Fire-eaters, anyone? [21.]

Continuing his campaign against the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Mayor Giuliani proposed breaking up the authority, calling on New York State to take over some of its functions and to create a new agency to operate the city's two airports, now run by the authority. The Mayor, however, has no authority to carry out the plan, and its prospects of winning approval in Albany, let alone among New Jersey's political leadership, are dim at best. [23.]

In China, on the Outside

Capt. George Duke arrived in China with four fellow New York City police officers on a pioneering mission: to team up with local Chinese police to fight the burgeoning criminal networks that operate between New York City and Fujian Province. Yet it turned out to be more of a lesson in how unwilling China's public security forces are to work with outsiders than anything else. [23.]
