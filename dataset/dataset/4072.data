But open warfare has not yet been declared, because prosecutors, as well as defense lawyers, must depend on judges, in the peculiar, at times pernicious symbiosis that is the criminal justice system. Justice Leavitt is now presiding over one of the District Attorney's high-profile cases, the prosecution of Richard D. DiGuglielmo, a white off-duty police officer who shot a black man who parked in front of the officer's father's delicatessen in what has been described as a bias incident.

And if Mr. Rukaj is indicted and the case goes to trial, prosecutors may well have to call Justice Leavitt to testify. ''I imagine the trial attorneys will question me differently than they would an ordinary witness,'' the judge said.

Ms. Pirro would give no corner. ''My trial attorneys are very savvy and well seasoned and are not intimidated by any witness, whether they are in a robe, a uniform, or prison garb,'' she said stiffly.

Westchester County defense lawyers characterize the judge, who was elected to the bench as a Republican in 1993, as independent minded, and not one they necessarily consider to be generous at sentencing. ''He can be harsher on drunk-driving cases than other judges because of his ambulance experience,'' said Rebecca Schenk, a Legal Aid lawyer.

Justice Leavitt does not disagree; he has recused himself from drunken-driving cases when he was in the ambulance at the scene. He concurs that his experiences off the bench do influence the perspective he brings to some crimes. ''You watch a child clutching a favorite blanket while their house is burning and you hear an arson case differently,'' he said.

''I often ask prosecutors: have you notified the victims that they can speak at sentencing?'' he said. ''I'd like to bring every prosecutor to the E.R. and say, 'This is a victim, this is what they look like -- you can't understand what they've suffered unless you see them.' ''

Justice Leavitt, who was born in Brooklyn, began his legal career as a prosecutor, first in Brooklyn and later in Westchester. When he decided to go into private practice, he was advised that one way to become known in Chappaqua, where he had moved with his wife and daughters, was to start volunteering.
