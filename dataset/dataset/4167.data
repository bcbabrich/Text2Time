To publicize their prime-time programming for the 1995-96 season, the CBS and NBC television networks are sponsoring large promotional partnerships.

CBS has teamed up with Sears, Roebuck & Company for an integrated promotion meant to create awareness of the new CBS fall schedule and attract customers to Sears stores for an annual anniversary sale. The network declined to discuss the budget.

The promotion, called "Where It's At," begins in September with print and broadcast advertising; on-line promotions on Prodigy, owned by Sears and I.B.M., and on the World Wide Web of the Internet, and a "CBS Fall Viewing Guide" booklet. A sweepstakes will offer consumers a grand prize to "Be a TV Hotshot" -- the chance to "get an inside look at life as a network executive." CBS previously sponsored promotions with the Kmart Corporation.

NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company; Nintendo of America and Blockbuster Video, which is owned by Viacom Inc., have joined for a $5 million promotion touting the NBC fall lineup and Virtual Boy, a new Nintendo 3-D video game that will be available to rent at Blockbuster. The promotion begins on Aug. 14 in 3,000 Blockbuster stores, with a sweepstakes offering prizes like trips to the tapings of NBC shows.
