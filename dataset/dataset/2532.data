WHEN the jurors for the World Trade Center memorial competition announced that they would consider designs from anyone who wanted to submit one, they were acting on principle. But for many of the people who responded to that invitation, the matter was deeply personal. Working on their own initiative and against lousy odds, determined to express themselves and to keep memory alive, they spent countless thousands of hours conceiving, drafting, revising and explaining their visions.

All told, 5,201 designs were submitted, from 63 countries and 49 states, from individuals of all ages, many without any design experience.

An unscientific survey revealed everything from scaled-down twin towers to classical references to sources at which observers can only guess. Here is a sampling of 10, culled from Web sites, blind submissions to The New York Times and word-of-mouth recommendations. In the coming weeks, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation will launch a Web site showing all the entries; they are also considering whether to display them in New York. JULIE V. IOVINE

AFFIRMATION OF LIFE

Macrae-Gibson Architects

ASKED why he not only submitted a scheme for the memorial competition but, unbidden, designed a master plan for the entire site as well, Gavin Macrae-Gibson, 48, a New York architect, said simply, ''Because my work, my city was under attack.'' Mr. Macrae-Gibson, who developed his proposal with the help of his entire staff of eight, wanted his design ''to celebrate the simple joys of city life'' at the same time as it commemorated the loss of so many lives. Concerned with the sunken portion of the site dictated by Daniel Libeskind's master plan, Mr. Macrae-Gibson strove to make sure there would be ''no feeling of going down into a pit.'' And so he divided the site into stone and grass, with the southern portion becoming a paved slope leading gently down while the north section would be a lawn sweeping up to street level.
