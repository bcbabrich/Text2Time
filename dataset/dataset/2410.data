THE stalls at local farmers' markets are filling out like cornfields in July. Each week there are more choices, even more farmers. As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens, you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. For each, the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different. Exact market locations and times are at www.cenyc.org, www.nyfarmersmarket.com and www.communitymarkets.biz.

Greens, Yes, But Especially August Corn

Sue and Henry Smith planned to be teachers. But Mr. Smith told his father, a truck farmer in Rockland County, in New York, that he would farm, too. He never left the land, and he and his wife now own Sycamore Farms, in Middletown, N.Y. They grow strawberries, peas and hothouse tomatoes, but pride themselves most on their corn. It is picked the evening before they go to the Greenmarket and arrives in time for the market's opening. On Saturdays, they bring a second batch at 10:30 a.m. They sell it earlier than most -- by the Fourth of July -- because they start some under plastic, a sort of hothouse. Their season continues until the end of October, or the first frost.

AVAILABLE -- Mr. Smith said the corn after Aug. 1 has better flavor because it takes longer to mature. "For early corn you sacrifice eating quality for availability," he said.

SELECTING -- Let them choose the ears for you, but if you do it, don't strip the leaves to inspect the kernels; it hastens the aging of the rejects. "Make sure there are no holes in the husk," Mrs. Smith said. "Then, if you run your hand tightly down the outside, you just want to feel a uniform cob, with no indentations and skips." Drying on leaves or at the cut end mean the corn is not fresh.
