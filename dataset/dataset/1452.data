It is a long-standing tradition that presidents send letters of condolence to the families of troops killed at war, whether by enemy fire, accident or illness. But since the Clinton administration at least, one group has not received those hand-signed notes: families of troops who committed suicide, even those who killed themselves while deployed to a war front.

It turns out, though, that on at least one occasion a president has made an exception to the no-letter protocol.

In 2005, 20-year-old Pfc. Jason Scheuerman killed himself while in Iraq with the 3rd Infantry Division. His father, Chris Scheuerman, a retired Army master sergeant, said his son had been struggling with depression and doubts about the war, and had sought counseling in the weeks before he died. But an Army psychologist who had not yet received his license to practice declared that Private Scheuerman might be feigning problems.

His commanding officers decided he was a “malingerer,” records obtained by Mr. Scheuerman showed, and sent him back to his unit. He was given back his weapon, but denied access to the Internet and telephone. About three weeks later he shot himself after tacking a note to his closet door that read, “I know you think I’m a coward for this but in the face of existing as I am now, I have no other choice.”

After learning about his son’s death, Mr. Scheuerman assumed that he would receive a letter from the president. When none arrived, he inquired with the White House and was subsequently told of the no-letter policy for suicides.

That policy, government officials have said, is based on concerns among senior military leaders that presidential letters of condolence might appear to condone or even encourage suicide.

Mr. Scheuerman wrote back arguing that the protocol was wrongheaded, particularly at a time when the Defense Department was trying to slow a rising tide of suicides. Last year, there were more than 300 suicides by active-duty military personnel members, the most since the Pentagon started keeping track in 1980. While most suicides occur on military bases in the United States, more than 184 troops have killed themselves while deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001.

“The fact that we continue the policy, we continue to stigmatize soldiers who suffer from mental illness,” Mr. Scheuerman said in a recent interview. “And we continue to punish the families of soldiers who succumb to the trauma of mental illness that nine years of war has cumulatively heaped upon them.”

The White House did not respond to Mr. Scheuerman’s second letter. But in late 2005, the son of the Indianapolis Colts’ coach Tony Dungy committed suicide, and President George W. Bush sent him a letter of condolence.

“I pray for you,” the president wrote in a letter that was read at James Dungy’s funeral. “May God keep you. May his light shine upon you.”

Mr. Scheuerman fired off a hand-written note to the White House asking why the son of a military family should be treated differently from the son of a professional football coach. (In addition to Mr. Scheuerman and his son Jason, Mr. Scheuerman’s wife, oldest son and other members of his extended family have served in the military.)

“Not taking away from the tragedy the Dungy family had experienced, I felt we had given a whole lot more and sacrificed a great much more for our nation’s safety than a football coach,” Mr. Scheuerman said in an interview.

A few weeks later, in March 2006, a letter from the White House arrived at the Scheuerman home in Sanford, N.C., near Fort Bragg, where Mr. Scheuerman worked at the time.

“Laura and I are saddened by the loss of your son, Jason,” the letter, signed by President Bush, said. “We know this has been a difficult time for you, and we send our heartfelt sympathy.”

Mr. Bush’s letter to Mr. Scheuerman surfaced only recently after he shared it with an Indianapolis man, Gregg Keesling, whose son committed suicide in Iraq last year. In an e-mail message, Mr. Keesling said he hoped that Mr. Bush’s letter would show that presidents have the flexibility to send letters based on a service member’s record, not on how the service member died.

“My son, and probably the vast majority who die by suicide, had honorable service,” he wrote.

At Mr. Keesling’s behest, two congressmen from Indiana have urged the Obama administration to modify the no-letter policy. White House aides say it is under review.
