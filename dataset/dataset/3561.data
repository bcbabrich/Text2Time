The resulting portrayal is of Washington as the ambitious yet reluctant leader. He turns away from power at nearly every critical moment in his career, starting from the end of his military service. He did not want to be Virginia's delegate to the Constitutional Convention, nor the nation's first president, and he did not want to serve a second term. He was melancholy and, from today's perspective, unduly pessimistic about how the experiment that was the United States would turn out.

''Our Affairs, generally, seem really, to be approaching to some awful crisis,'' he wrote Knox from the Constitutional Convention in 1787. ''God only knows what the result will be. It shall be my part to hope for the best; as to see this Country happy whilst I am gliding down the stream of life in tranquil retirement is so much the wish of my Soul.''

There are letters in which Washington agonizes over his ownership of slaves, including correspondence in which he considers leasing Mount Vernon to, as he obliquely put it, ''liberate a certain species of property which I possess, very repugnantly to my own feelings.'' The slaves were not freed until the execution of Washington's will, which can also be viewed as a published pamphlet at the Morgan. At times Washington's sentiments seemed conflicted: in another letter he advises a friend on ways to trick an escaped slave back into service.

Washington's correspondence here is unfailingly fascinating. A letter from the battlefield finds Washington the general begging for gunpowder to arm his troops. Later he turns to a neighbor for a loan to pay for the trip to his Inauguration. ''Never 'till within these last two yrs I have experienced the want of money,'' he wrote. ''Under this statement I am inclined to do what I have never expected to be reduced to the necessity of doing -- that is, to borrow money upon interest.'' Washington found himself in these straits partly because he declined a salary while commanding the Continental Army, though he did file an expense account. He claimed $64,335.30 over eight and half years, including reimbursement for his laundry.

Often it is the medium itself -- the written letter -- that is the most stirring aspect of this exhibition, starting with those written by Washington, but also including some of his contemporaries. Martha Washington wrote from her camp outside Boston in the winter of 1775, ''Some days we have a number of Cannon and shells from Boston and Bunkers Hill, but it does not seem to surprise anyone but me; I confess I shudder every time I hear the sound of a gun.''

And John Adams, an aging man writing in a cramped hand, offers a rather prickly judgment of Washington after his death. In words that resonate today Adams describes the first president as one of the ''great masters of the theatrical exhibitions of politics.'' He added, ''Washington understood this art very well, and we may say of him if he was not the greatest President, he was the best actor of Presidency we have ever had.''
