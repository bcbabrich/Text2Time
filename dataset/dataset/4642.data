Acting just minutes after a 12:01 A.M. deadline today, the New York City Council approved bills that prevent a substantial increase in property taxes for owners of condominiums, cooperatives and rental apartment buildings. The action came less than an hour after the State Senate paved the way for the Council's action.

Property taxes for a typical condominium or cooperative apartment will increase by about $49 over the next year, or less than 4 percent, as a result of the bills, according to calculations by the City Council staff. The bill for a typical owner of a one- , two- or three-family house will decrease by about $14.

The Senate and the Council acted to block significantly higher increases for the owners of apartments that would have resulted from a decision three weeks ago by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment. The state board ruled that owners of apartments and apartment buildings should pay a larger share of the city's property taxes.

The board's decision could have caused the tax bill for a typical apartment owner to go up by as much as $123 a year, according to the city's Finance Department, and it could have caused the typical single-family home owner's bill to decrease by $76.
