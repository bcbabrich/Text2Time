The first thing you notice is how happy he is. Walking into a suite that until recently was Dick Cheney’s turf, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is smiling — big time.

“All the years you covered me, I never, quite frankly, thought about the vice presidency,” Mr. Biden, a former Delaware senator, said in an interview last week in what was once the secretary of war’s office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. “And when President Obama asked me to join him, I wasn’t at all sure whether there was a right place for me,” he said, adding, “But it’s working out.”

For a loquacious 66-year-old whose career has seen family tragedy, a health crisis and two failed presidential runs, that is a rare understatement. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said, “It’s an adjustment for Joe — every day is like Christmas.”



Mr. Biden will need good humor for his first new job since Richard M. Nixon’s presidency. And now his skills face unexpectedly early tests — in the administration’s effort to prevent its economic stimulus package from becoming a partisan exercise, and in trying to salvage Tom Daschle’s nomination for health and human services secretary despite controversy over previously unpaid taxes.

The vice president has not surrendered his edgy, sometimes impolitic sense of humor. After publicly tweaking Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. during their first days in high office for bungling Mr. Obama’s inaugural oath (the president appeared unamused), Mr. Biden elbowed their predecessors last week by greeting labor union officials with a tart “Welcome back to the White House.”

Nor has he shed his propensity to rattle press aides. In the interview, his comments on the financial industry bailout and on union-organizing legislation left administration staff members scrambling to make clear that he was not articulating new policy or diverging from Mr. Obama’s position.

Yet Mr. Obama chose Mr. Biden not for his verbal facility, but for his experience and what David Axelrod, the president’s strategist, calls “profound common sense.” Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. grew up understanding economic misfortune through the financial setbacks suffered by Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.

“He has never forgotten his roots,” Mr. Obama said last week in naming the vice president to head a task force on the economic prospects of middle-class families.

More relevant this week are the instincts Mr. Biden honed in six terms in the Senate. Two political dramas there are challenging the administration’s script for its first month in office.



One concerns the stimulus package, which despite the president’s desire for bipartisan backing did not win a single Republican vote in the House. From the telephone to the Senate gym, Mr. Biden has been plying former colleagues for Republican support in the Senate, with little obvious payoff so far.

“This bill is a stinker,” Mr. Graham said, predicting that significant Republican cooperation would come only with fundamental changes in the package. White House officials show no sign of acceding.

The other immediate problem is the nomination of Mr. Daschle, the former Senate majority leader who informed Obama officials only after his cabinet nomination that he was liable for $128,000 in back taxes. The morning of the interview, before the tax controversy flared up publicly, Mr. Biden ate breakfast alone with Mr. Daschle. He is working to salvage the nomination, which even Daschle allies agree is in doubt.

Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a Democratic colleague for nearly three decades, calls these situations precisely where Mr. Biden’s relationships and his feel for “the rhythms of the Senate” can help Mr. Obama assess his options. While Mr. Biden casually sounds out former colleagues, Mr. Dodd explained, “He can say, ‘Off the record — the president’s not going to know your name — what do you think?’ ”

Mr. Biden credits his much younger boss with a similarly unceremonious leadership style, evoking former President Bill Clinton’s White House but with a greater level of discipline.

“There’s never been an elected official I’ve worked with — a president or in my iteration as a senator for 36 years — who is as incisive and disciplined about what he focuses on,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Obama. “He’s clear, he’s disciplined, there’s a precision in his thinking that has surprised everyone.”

“And it goes along with a genuine informality,” he continued. “That informality breeds you being prepared to say, ‘Well, Mr. President, I don’t think that works … . As opposed to walking in and saying, ‘Sir … .’ ”
