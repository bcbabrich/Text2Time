The choice of the Narragansett Hotel, a home to many college students during the school year, was not the Cheikh's; his followers in New York picked it for him.

"We were looking for two weeks," said Mouhamadou Lamime Diagne, a trade analyst who picked up the Cheikh at the airport. The Narragansett, a mostly single-room occupancy hotel near 93d Street, "was the one we found so he will be near the community," Mr. Diagne said. Most Senegalese in New York live in Harlem.

Cheikh Mbacke's visit, lately an annual event, has become a spectacle. When he emerges from the hotel each morning, he is surrounded by a security team. They have to contend with some of the Cheikh's followers waiting outside who rush toward him, hoping to touch his clothing. "We keep telling him he should move to Central Park West," said one security officer with walkie-talkie in hand. "It's impossible to protect people here."

The 74-year-old Cheikh then climbs into a limousine and goes off in a motorcade that takes him around the city.

Inside the hotel, hundreds of visitors arrive in the course of a day -- some in bright robes, some in gaudy T-shirts, some in business suits. Many pack the elevator to see the Cheikh, who is on the eighth floor with his retinue of about 15 people, most of them older men. When visitors arrive, he retreats behind a veiled doorway to greet them.
