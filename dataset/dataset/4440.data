"After that fight, I had an itch on my back and I couldn't scratch it," McGirt said, smiling. "Now I can scratch it. I can go. I'll go till my shoulder falls off."

Buddy McGirt is a trendy throwback. He arrived at Bufano's in a black homburg and a long fur coat. But after he walked up the rickety stairs into the second-floor shadows, he was transformed into a fighter out of a 1940's black-and-white movie. Sitting alone on a wooden bench in front of dusty gray-metal lockers behind two battered pool tables littered with newspapers, he changed into boxing gear not much different from that of other gladiators who trained here in other years: Chuck Wepner, Frankie De Paula, Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, even Sonny Liston once.

In his work clothes now, McGirt moved into the big bright room that the ring all but filled, the early afternoon light flowing through five bare windows. He sat on a chair as Certo wrapped the hands that have produced a 59-2-1 record with 44 knockouts.

Other than Chavez, not many boxers have that many fights anymore. Not the good ones anyway. With million-dollar paydays, the good ones stop boxing sooner now. Or will stop sooner. Whitaker has a 31-1 record with 15 knockouts. But will he endure until he's had 60 fights? Unlikely. Other than Chavez, how many of today's fighters have had 60 fights?

"Wimpy Halstead," McGirt said. "Buck Smith."

Halstead is an Oklahoma heavyweight with some 90 fights, Smith an Arkansas middleweight with more than 100 fights. But if the tendinitis in his left shoulder continues to bother him, how many more punches are there in 29-year-old Buddy McGirt's hands?

How many more moves are there in McGirt's brain, which absorbed lessons from the old-timers who visited Al Certo's custom tailor store in nearby Secaucus.

"I'd listen to them talking among themselves -- Willie Pep, Jersey Joe Walcott, Joey Giardello," he said. "I remember hearing that boxing is a lot of obstacles, that you got to be strong to put up with the obstacles: the training, the fights that don't come off."
