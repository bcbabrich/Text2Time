He also wrote and illustrated a series of children’s books starring Sally, a Labrador retriever. Among them is “Sally Goes to the Beach” (Abrams, 2000), which appeared briefly on the New York Times children’s best-seller list.

He was the subject of a book, “The Art of Stephen Huneck” (Abrams, 2004), by Laura Beach.

Mr. Huneck’s masterwork was the Dog Chapel, which he began building in 1997. It sits on Dog Mountain, a vast park-like space he and his wife owned near St. Johnsbury. Dog Mountain, which is open to the public at no charge, includes a gallery, hiking trails and an agility course for dogs.

Small, modest and white, the chapel resembles a 19th-century New England church from the outside, apart from the steeple topped by a winged Labrador. A sign proclaims: “Welcome: All Creeds, All Breeds. No Dogmas Allowed.”

Inside, the four pews, handmade by Mr. Huneck, are supported by carved wooden dogs. Stained-glass windows depict dogs in various poses. The walls are almost entirely covered with handwritten notes to departed pets, placed there by grieving visitors.

“I’ve learned so much more about love from my dogs than I ever did from my parents or the church,” Mr. Huneck told The Chicago Tribune in 1997. “They’re really great teachers. They love you with their whole heart.”

Stephen Huneck was born on Oct. 8, 1948, in Columbus, Ohio, and reared in Sudbury, Mass. (The family name is pronounced HYOO-neck.) Severely dyslexic and unhappy in a home he described afterward as turbulent, he left at 17 “with 33 cents in his pocket,” his wife said.

Mr. Huneck later studied at the Massachusetts College of Art, before becoming an antiques dealer. Through repairing wooden pieces, he taught himself how to carve. In 1984, one of his original carvings caught the eye of a New York dealer, and he was soon making art full time.

In addition to his wife, the former Gwendolyn Ide, Mr. Huneck is survived by his parents, five sisters and a brother.

Two books written and illustrated by Mr. Huneck, “Sally’s Great Balloon Adventure” and “Even Bad Dogs Go to Heaven,” are scheduled to be published by Abrams this year.

Of Mr. Huneck’s network of galleries, only the one on Dog Mountain remains. The fate of Dog Mountain, the chapel and the gallery is uncertain, Ms. Huneck said. But with the renewed demand for her husband’s work that his death has engendered, she said, she was able to hire back most of the employees let go last month.
