It is a theme that his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, struck in a little-noted speech on Dec. 20 in which he described the "common ground" that has emerged on training Iraqi forces and building a cohesive government there.

"We've listened to our critics and are already pursuing many of their proposals," he insisted, though he drew the line, as Mr. Bush has, at pulling out troops prematurely. Mr. Bush is expected to hit the same themes.

After his days of silence here, Mr. Bush on Saturday began to give the country a taste of the tone he has in mind. In his New Year's radio address he argued that in Iraq, American forces were "overcoming earlier setbacks" -- another reference to errors in Iraq since the invasion that he was long loath to acknowledge. But he began to do so last month, a decision that White House officials now boast was the key to reversing the worst slide in his approval ratings since the beginning of his presidency. Mr. Bush also said that after the Dec. 15 Iraqi election, whose results are still in flux, the country was on its way to "an inclusive, unified and lasting democracy."

On the economic front he insisted that, even with tax cuts, his government was "staying on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009," but he made no mention of the fact that his Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, asked Congress on Thursday to raise the debt limit again, the fourth time in Mr. Bush's presidency, so that the government can borrow more money, largely for increases in military and entitlement programs.

But the deficit may be only one of the gathering clouds in his dealings with a Republican Congress that has been uncommonly unruly in recent months. Though Mr. Bush avoided the subject in his radio address, some of his advisers and national security officials say the White House has decided in the past two weeks to take a hard line with Congressional inquiries into Mr. Bush's secret authorization of wiretaps without warrants on suspects within the United States.

The White House's effort to deflect a Congressional investigation into a secret executive order he issued in 2002 authorizing domestic spying follows a strategy Mr. Bush tried -- and ultimately retreated from -- in the controversies over why he claimed Saddam Hussein was seeking uranium in Africa and what kind of warnings the White House received about Al Qaeda's ambitions before the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Bush's aides and intelligence officials say they plan to refuse to offer more details in public on why they believe the technology of the program made it necessary to bypass the secret court designed to authorize wiretapping efforts inside the United States. They are preparing to dispute vigorously and quite publicly the broader legal critique, offered by some Democrats, the American Civil Liberties Union and some Republicans, that the president acted beyond his authority as commander in chief.

"We're not going to shy away from this debate," Mr. Bush's counselor, Dan Bartlett, said on Friday from Washington.

In interviews over the past week, Mr. Bush's aides said they were convinced that Mr. Bush's decision to admit that he authorized the program -- and then to say little about its details -- would be enough to keep an increasingly fractious Republican majority in line.

But they are clearly worried about the minor revolt among Republicans in both the House and the Senate that forced Mr. Bush to accept an amendment authored by Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, setting in law a commitment that American interrogators would not employ "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment" of detainees anywhere in the world. The administration had vigorously opposed the amendment, which Mr. Bush signed into law on Friday. He said he was satisfied by additional language assuring that interrogators could not be sued by terror suspects.

Some of Mr. Bush's advisers say they believe that revolt was partly the result of weak leadership in the House, where Representative Tom DeLay has stepped down from his leadership position while under indictment, and in the Senate, where Mr. Bush was abandoned by leaders of his own party on the McCain amendment.

But they see in Judge Alito's confirmation battle and the USA Patriot Act a chance to rally both their base and queasy senators. A senior administration official, speaking on the condition that he not be named because he was describing a strategy still in motion, said that advisers believed that while the fight over Judge Alito would be much fiercer than the battle to confirm Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., "we're now convinced we'll prevail, probably pretty quickly."

Winning passage of the Patriot Act, however, will be trickier, especially at a moment that the president is accused of circumventing existing law that places checks on the administration's power to trace and monitor calls inside American borders. Two officials said that discussions were under way about beefing up some form of Congressional oversight of investigations conducted under the Patriot Act, in hopes that that will bring enough moderate Republicans on board to win passage. Mr. Bush reluctantly agreed to a five-week extension of the existing law, which he signed this week.

"At this point, one of the keys for the president's strategy, I suspect, is to look for an early success, and build on that," said Fred Greenstein, a Princeton professor who has written extensively on Mr. Bush's strategy.

But there is also considerable risk for a president who only a month ago found his approval ratings hovering around 35 percent. They have bounced back up after his series of Iraq speeches and, as White House officials note, the rapid decline in gasoline prices. A New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted Dec. 2-6 put his approval rating at 40 percent, up from 35 percent a month before, while an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted Dec. 15-18 showed an increase to 47 percent, up from 39 percent in early November.

Nonetheless, his options are limited by Iraq, where there is still concern that some Republicans may join the call for a pullout as midterm elections approach, and the fact that the moment appears to have passed for big initiatives that were a cornerstone of his re-election campaign, including an overhaul of the Social Security system.

William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, who helped lead the Republican revolt that forced Mr. Bush to withdraw Harriet E. Miers as a nominee for the Supreme Court in the fall, said that in most years January was a month for planning the State of the Union speech and laying out the year's agenda. But this January, he said, is different.

"The notion that Bush could or should unveil a new domestic agenda at the State of the Union speech is really ridiculous," Mr. Kristol said. "He has to play the cards he has been dealt and play a winning hand with those cards," on issues including the war in Iraq, the linked debate over the Patriot Act and wiretapping at home, and the Alito nomination.

Mr. Kristol argued that the president had already come back substantially from October, when he was mired by the slow response to Hurricane Katrina, then by the Miers nomination, and then the indictment of White House aide I. Lewis Libby.

"It looked like he was really reeling, but I think he has righted the boat," Mr. Kristol said.

And he contended that by equating withdrawal with defeat, Mr. Bush had for now beaten back the movement that crested a few weeks ago when Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania, called for some form of a pullout from Iraq.

Others agree. "I think that the Democrats made a huge miscalculation with the Murtha speech. It moved the debate from 'Did the president lie?' to 'What do we do now?' " said Charles Cook, who publishes an independent political newsletter. "And that moved the spotlight from a horrible place for the president to not a bad place at all." But depending on events Mr. Bush cannot control, he said, that change may be "only for a while."

White House Memo Correction: January 7, 2006, Saturday A White House Memo article on Sunday about President Bush's vacation and plans for 2006 included erroneous information from a White House news briefing about visitors to the Bush ranch during the holidays. After entertaining Laura Bush's mother, Jenna Welch, the Bushes later invited six longtime friends from Texas for New Year's Eve, according to information released by the White House after the Bushes returned to Washington. Mrs. Welch was not the only holiday visitor.
