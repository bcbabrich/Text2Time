“North Holland and Friesland Bike and Sail Adventure,” departing in 2016, introduces a new destination and mode of transportation from VBT Bicycling and Walking Vacations. Highlights of the seven-night trip include nearly daily cycling through Dutch polders (land reclaimed from the sea), exploring traditional fishing villages, walking along some of Europe’s widest beaches on the island of Terschelling and an introduction to the Frisian language, similar to but separate from Dutch.

Home base will be the Mare Fan Fryslan, a former freight ship that was transformed into a three-masted schooner. Onboard facilities include a wheelhouse bar and top-deck Jacuzzi.

The tour makes six departures from May through September, starting at $3,145.
