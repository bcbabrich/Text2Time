The only weak part of the season’s new qualifying system is – as has often been pointed out – the first 12 minutes or so of the third and last 20-minute part when the final 10 cars go around in circles doing nothing at all but burn fuel.

At Indianapolis today, though, that for me was the highest moment of the weekend so far, for its significance against the backdrop of last year’s U.S. Grand Prix fiasco. There they were, today, a year later, in front of a burgeoning crowd (as opposed to a big one) and nine of the 10 cars in the final session went out together, waiting in the pit lane for the light to turn from red to green before they engaged in a race to burn fuel.

The big word is “race.” It was really like a grid line-up as the cars waited and then off the start Fernando Alonso got the better of Michael Schumacher and refused to let him pass. There could be no other reason than to show who is boss. Once they were really into it, though, when it was clear the Spaniard was slower, Alonso let Schumacher pass, and the German acknowledged it with a friendly wave.

Even so, there they were, 9 cars going around as if racing against each other – instead of six cars during last year’s race – and these were the fastest cars of the day – unlike last year’s situation – and they were soon to be joined by the tenth. Four more than last year on the Sunday, and more of a race.

But it looks as if Michelin has been a little more conservative with their compounds – as the two Ferraris were fastest, and Ralf Schumacher was right up there too on his Bridgestones, in eighth position. Which is great for a guy who does not want to race on the Indianapolis track where he had an accident each of the last two years.

The story of the fiasco is now fading into the past. The possibility of a thunderstorm tomorrow could create a different kind of fiasco for the drivers, of course. But will the public think about how when it rains on the Indianapolis 500 there is no race – whereas in Formula One … Donington 1993, Spain 1996, Nurburgring 1999….
