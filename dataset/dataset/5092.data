Corrugated sheet metals have been a staple in manufacturing and construction for years, because a serpentine shape increases stiffness and strength without requiring extra thickness.

But despite its simple virtues, corrugation has generally been impossible for wood, which tends to break when bent. Ethan S. Ernest, a former architecture student in Manhattan, has offered a solution. He has designed a wood press consisting of two surfaces, each with a corrugated mold.

Instead of pressing the boards together with a uniform pressure, which would crush them, the machine works more like a zipper. It begins pressing boards at one end and then slowly closes, one section at a time. The method reduces the strain, Mr. Ernest said, and results in a uniform wave.

The wood should be useful in prefabricated housing, Mr. Ernest said, as well as for furniture.
