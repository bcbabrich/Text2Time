A woman who won $5 million in a Canadian lottery in 1984 has had her house seized for back taxes and has been arrested and accused of plotting to kill her daughter-in-law.

On Saturday Mary Ellen Futch, 64 years old, ''negotiated a contract with our undercover detective for $5,000'' to kill the wife of her youngest son, a spokesman for the Hillsborough County Sheriff, Jack Espinosa, said.

Mrs. Futch was held without bond and charged with soliciting for the first-degree murder of Peggy Futch, 23. If convicted, she faces a prison term of up to 30 years.

Her son, Henry Futch, said money troubles had left his mother distraught, but he and his wife said they were still shocked.
