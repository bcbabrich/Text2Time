Kentucky should be happier to have him. He is gracious, he is gentlemanly and he is the man you want coaching your son. He has actually coached both of his sons, G. G. at Georgia and Saul at Kentucky, and Cameron Mills was one of several players who called him a father figure. Anyone call Rupp that and mean it? Even some of Pitino's former players conceded he cared about little besides their basketball skills.

Tubby Smith has always been his own man.

''Ever since he was first hired, there was all that hype about him being the first black coach at Kentucky,'' Mills said. ''There was all the pressure he endured for himself and the fans after the losses when people said he wasn't Rick Pitino. Well, he's not Rick Pitino. He's Tubby Smith. And they both have a national title.''

Jeff Sheppard, the closest player to a star that Smith had in a program that has lost five first-round draft picks in the last two seasons, said, ''He does a really good job of teaching us basketball, but even a better job of teaching us how to be men.''

One of the more irritating aspects of college basketball is that the coaches often receive too much attention. Not to add to that, but Smith deserved a bundle of praise for helping the Wildcats erase a 10-point deficit, the largest overcome during a title game, to enable Kentucky to win the school's seventh national championship. The comeback might have satisfied even the fan who talked about the Wildcats, then 21-3, on a Feb. 11 radio show by saying, ''I haven't given up on them yet.''

That sounded ludicrous then, and more so now. Under Smith, this team obliterated a 17-point deficit in the final nine minutes against Duke in the South Regional and rallied from 10 points back to beat Stanford in the national semifinals. In the title game, Smith made three clever adjustments and substituted like a savant after Utah's man-to-man steered it to a 41-31 lead at the half.
