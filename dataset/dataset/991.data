SOLLAR--Siema, left us peacefully on the morning of Thursday, May 30th, with her husband by her side. She was most certainly a woman of valor, and an adoring wife, mother, grandmother, and sister-in-law. Siema was a woman of great intelligence and insight, with a strong will and indomitable spirit. She used her considerable gifts throughout her adult life to champion the cause of care for the developmentally disabled and to help individuals with developmental disabilities lead lives of dignity and meaning. In this regard, Siema always had a special place in her heart for The Maplebrook School in Amenia, NY, and New England Village in Pembroke, MA, where her beloved son David currently resides. Siema's passion and creativity were the moving force behind the creation of New England Village's Sollar Wellness Center, an innovative facility designed to enrich the lives of those with developmental challenges. She was also deeply involved in numerous other charitable causes, and she touched the lives of many people over the course of her lifetime. Siema is survived by her husband Arnold Sollar, daughter Marilyn Sollar McCormack, son David Sollar, son-in-law John McCormack, granddaughter Phoebe McCormack, and sister and brother-in-law Elaine and Edwin Eisen. Funeral services will be held at 12:45pm on Monday, June 3rd at Riverside Memorial Chapel, located on Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street in Manhattan. Donations in Siema's memory may be made to New England Village, 664 School Street, Pembroke, MA 02359.
