To the Editor:

John Russell's tribute to Tom Armstrong's tenure as director of the Whitney Museum of American Art is well founded [''Adding Up the Costs of Changes at the Top,'' March 18] . Nevertheless, he should not have been shocked by Mr. Armstrong's recent dismissal. It's an occupational hazard.

A museum with contemporary focus - like the Whitney - whose trustees are committed largely to patronage of living artists cannot be expected to demonstrate policy based in tradition and stability. These contemporary patron-trustees tend to make decisions in a businessman's vacuum, unlike the ''collecteur-amateurs'' of earlier times.

A practical truth may be that a museum director's job security varies directly with the average age of the works collected or exhibited by the museum. Although disturbing news for contemporary-museum officers, this equation should give comfort to those working at institutions solidly bound to the art of previous centuries.
