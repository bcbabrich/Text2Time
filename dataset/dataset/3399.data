To the Editor:

Much as children must at some time realize that their parents are not infallible entities, so the American people must abandon their inappropriate illusion that statesmen and stateswomen, indeed any public figure, should serve as role models (letters, Dec. 30). These individuals have jobs to do, not illusions to fulfill. Parents' expectation that public figures should act as role models is only further shirking their own role.

Our President committed a lamentable personal mistake. We do not have the right to feel personally betrayed. That is the private domain of Mr. Clinton's family.
