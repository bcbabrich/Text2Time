Criticism of portfolio insurance does not stop there. Some financial experts also argue that as a product, portfolio insurance is not all it should be. To gain protection against declines, investors must sacrifice potential gains in a rising market. The greater the protection, the greater the sacrifice. That cost of lost potential, opponents say, is the real cost, or ''premium,'' that the funds pay, not the customary fee of three one-hundredths of the portfolio's value. FOR their part, pension fund managers increasingly welcome portfolio insurance as a tool that enables them to invest more aggressively. After adopting an insurance program for its pension assets in 1985, the Manville Corporation ''became much more equity oriented, which allowed us to make a lot more money in this bull market,'' says Charles F. Lemons, director for Trusteed Benefit Funds. ''We increased the equity portion to 70 percent, from about 50 percent,enabling us to lock up market gains as they have occurred.'' Moreover, he adds, ''the additional return form the heavy equity investment should offset the insurance cost.''

Despite the accusations that the portfolio insurers are roiling the stock market, Mr. Leland, still a professor finance and applied economics at the University of California at Berkeley, says portfolio insurance is a very conservative business. ''We are not in the business of trying to predict or beat the market,'' he said. ''That distinguishes us from a large proportion of investment managers. Our job is to build a hedge to engineer returns as close as possible to customers' objectives.'' And in this performance-oriented market, the business has continued to build, even in the face of the prolonged rally. Recently, the Aetna Insurance Company began to issue actual insurance against losses on ''insured'' portfolios. Aetna itself offers regular portfolio insurance and acts as agent for programs offered by Leland O'Brien.

Does this portend further explosive growth in portfolio insurance? Probably not, says Ralph S. Tate a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty Company. Mr. Tate expects that its share of the total market ''will have a more mature growth rate.''

Nevertheless, Mr. Tate acknowledges that unexpectedly strong growth could present problems for the markets. ''If the business exploded, going from $50 billion to $500 billion, then we'd have to worry,'' he said. SOLVING A PORTFOLIO DILEMMA

''Help,'' cried the manager of a $500 million pension fund who had all of his assets invested in stock. ''What do I do if the market plunges?'' The manager knew it was possible to follow a more conservative strategy, by moving out of stocks, into bonds. But the question then was, ''Where will I be if the market rises?''

These questions are what money management is all about, but today's money managers have strategies and techniques not available a decade ago.

To resolve the dilemma, the fund manager sought the advice of a portfolio insurance expert, Roger Sayler, managing director in charge of futures and options at J. P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., a subsidiary of J. P. Morgan & Company. The goal: A two-year plan that would allow the fund to earn as much as possible, but protect it from losing more than 5 percent of the original $500 million. (This example is based on a real Morgan client, but the details are camouflaged to cover the client's identity.) First, Mr. Sayler applied a mathematical model to determine the portion of the fund's assets that should be invested in stocks and the amount that should be in the equivalent of risk-free government securities. Based on interest rates, stock yields and other market condition, he concluded that the fund should put 75 percent of its assets into stocks.
