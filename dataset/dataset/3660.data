The warnings that the bubble is about to burst have been sounded each quarter for the last few years, but investors in the stock market continue to ignore them. And so far, despite a series of blows lately that were widely expected to take the air out of the balloon, they have been right.

Sure, the Asian economic crisis poses a threat to already slowing corporate profit growth at home. And yes, the recent rise in wages could eventually mean a revival of serious inflation. Yet all indications are that the American economy is remarkably sound, seemingly indestructible, and therefore, investors surmise, so is Wall Street.

That's why, midway through 1998, share prices are once again hovering near their all-time highs. The investing public, for all the complaints of the professionals, remains sanguine about the unheard-of riches being delivered by one of the greatest bull markets in history.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- a widely followed proxy for the larger stock market and millions of index-fund investors -- is up nearly 17 percent this year. The Dow Jones industrial average, the best-known market barometer, is up 13 percent in a year that many Wall Street pros had forecast full-year gains of less than 8 percent.
