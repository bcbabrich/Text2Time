Can New York City's Board of Education do anything right? It has a dismal record on counting dropouts. It stands by while hundreds of homeless children also go school-less. It has allowed the search for a chancellor to drag on for months. The board badly needs a victory, and a prime opportunity now presents itself: contract negotiations with school custodians.

Over the years, school officials have ceded control of the 1,000 school buildings to custodians who operate both as city employees and independent contractors. They receive an allocation from which they pay other workers and purchase supplies. That might make sense if the custodians were held accountable for the condition of schools. But the supervisors who oversee and rate them for promotions now belong to the same union. Custodians are required to clean schools only every other day. Frustrated principals complain that custodians refuse minor maintenance like changing light bulbs or fixing broken toilets.

More, they are allowed to charge ''opening fees'' to outside groups for use of classrooms, gymnasiums and other school facilities during non-class hours, a privilege that helps bring their average annual salary to $50,000.

City Council President Andrew Stein rightly denounces this astonishing arrangement as ''legalized extortion.'' Robert Wagner Jr., president of the Board of Education, says he is determined to ''reclaim control of the schools.'' Doing so will require dramatic and fundamental change. At a minimum, district and borough managers need to be removed from the custodians' union and made directly accountable to the board, and principals need the authority to order maintenance work directly from their schools' custodians. Reducing, or eliminating, opening fees is essential to after-hours and weekend programs that benefit whole neighborhoods.
