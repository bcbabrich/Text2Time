Slide 1 of 17,

Lorenzo Serafini, the romantic-spirited creative director of Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini, has a host of secret places he loves to visit throughout Milan — many of them within walking distance of his home in this early-19th-century apartment building east of the Duomo, set on what used to be one of the city’s many canals.

Correction: An earlier caption for picture No. 1 in the accompanying slide show misstated the relationship between the brand Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini and Alberta Ferretti. The brand is owned by the Aeffe Group, not by Ferretti herself.
