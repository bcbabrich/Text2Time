Prosecutors said yesterday that the complainant in a Queens assault and robbery case had been threatened in order to ''dissuade'' him from testifying against the defendants, who are John Gotti, the reputed head of the Gambino crime family, and another man.

The Queens District Attorney's office also said the brakes of the complainant's car had been tampered with on one occasion.

The statements were made in a prosecutor's affidavit disclosed in State Supreme Court in Queens as part of a request by the office of the District Attorney, John J. Santucci, for an anonymous jury in the case. Under such a procedure, the jurors' identities would not be disclosed to the prosecution, the defense or the public.

Attorneys for Mr. Gotti and the second defendant, Frank Colletta, told Justice Ann B. Dufficy that they had ''never heard'' of the reported brake-tampering or threats against the complainant, Romual Piecyk.
