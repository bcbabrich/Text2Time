The Jets hardly had the most challenging schedule this season, but they did beat the Patriots at New England, where they’ll return Sunday for a playoff game.

It was the Jets’ most impressive victory of the season. A seemingly gleeful Ron Borges of The Boston Globe described it this way.

(Borges has been a fierce critic of Bill Belichick, not easy to do when a guy wins three Super Bowl titles in four years.)

After the game, the Patriots’ Richard Seymour, with no points for originality, said, “We got outplayed and we got outcoached.” There is an accompanying video link in which Belichick engages in his least favorite activity: talking to reporters after a loss.

Also from The Globe, by Jim McBride today:

Five things Patriots fans should know about the Jets:

1. Chad Pennington is smart: The Jets quarterback won’t bowl you over with a great arm or great mobility. Instead, he wins games by making good decisions. Pennington is a true field general who takes what the defense gives him and rarely gambles. He reads defenses quickly and is at his best when he’s picking you apart with short and intermediate throws. He’ll never be confused with a gunslinger such as Peyton Manning, but he can be lethal just the same.

2. They have excellent receivers: Laveranues Coles and Jerricho Cotchery complement each other well. Coles is the speed burner. The 5-11, 193-pounder is stronger than he looks and has a ton of moves after the catch. Cotchery lacks speed but knows how to get open. He works hard to gain separation and won’t shy away when things get physical. Neither Coles nor Cotchery are particularly effective blockers.

3. Jonathan Vilma’s a monster: One of the game’s great inside linebackers, the 6-1, 230-pound beast will be all over your television screen come Sunday. Vilma uses his exceptional hands to not only shed blockers quickly but to inflict punishment on ball carriers. Vilma excels at reading and reacting and forces teams to run outside, where wingmen Eric Barton and Victor Hobson clean up any leftovers.

4. They have fresh legs: In the absence of a true horse in the backfield, the Jets go with “tailback by committee.” Rookie Leon Washington is the most consistent of the bunch. The 5-8, 202-pound sparkplug runs with great balance and decent speed. Injury-prone Kevan Barlow is a between-the-tackles slasher who shows flashes but too often disappears for long stretches. Cedric Houston has been battling a calf injury but can be sneaky fast.

5. You’re going to be sick of this storyline: By the time Sunday rolls around, fans will be fed up with the Bill Belichick-Eric Mangini hype. Yes, Mangini learned a lot from Belichick and yes, there appears to be tension between the former friends/co-workers. Both coaches are very familiar with their opponent but it’s the players who have to execute the game plans. It all should make for another interesting midfield meeting when the final gun sounds.
