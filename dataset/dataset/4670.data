When sweet corn plants are attacked by a caterpillar, they release chemicals to call wasps to rescue them in a defensive response from all over the plant, not just the part under attack, researchers say.

The new twist in the repertoire of plant defense mechanisms is described today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Dr. Ted Turlings and Dr. James Tumlinson of the Department of Agriculture.

Chemical counterattacks are common among plants, but most responses are direct defenses that are either aimed at the digestive system of the offending herbivore or mire the intruder in sticky ooze.

Triggered by some substance in the caterpillar's saliva, volatile chemicals called terpenoids are released into every leaf of the corn plant only hours after an encroaching insect starts biting. From the leaves the chemicals become airborne and entice wasps to follow the chemical trail to the damaged leaf. The wasps are able to find and attack the herbivores, which would otherwise be too tiny to find.
