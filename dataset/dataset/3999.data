John Huston was walking toward history at the Memorial Tournament today, following his perfect tee shot down the 17th fairway at Muirfield Village. Behind him was the flaming wreckage of the golf course that he had already torched for 10 birdies and an eagle. In front of him, if he could add just one more birdie in the final two holes, was the all-time PGA Tour scoring record of 59.

He was laughing, joking with his caddie, just as a man with a large belly and a bigger voice yelled, "Somebody go get Jack Nicklaus out here, 'cause this course is just too easy."

Huston smiled. He was thinking about the record now, and it was funny, because the way he was playing golf, Muirfield Village did seem easy. He had only to hit a 9-iron from 142 yards somewhere in the vicinity of the flag and make the putt. Then, if he parred 18, he would join Al Geiberger and Chip Beck, the only players to break the 60 barrier. Geiberger shot a 59 in 1977 in the Memphis Classic; Beck did it in the Las Vegas Invitational in 1991.

That was probably the moment the spell was broken. You don't talk about no-hitters and you don't think about 59's. The 9-iron shot drifted and bounced into the deep right bunker. Huston hit an exquisite bunker shot, deftly killing the speed of the ball in the fringe and allowing it to trickle two and a half feet from the hole.
