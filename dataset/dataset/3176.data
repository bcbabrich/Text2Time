We've endured the tragedy. Now we have to endure the farce.

Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, enjoying an unprecedented outpouring of adulation, from standing ovations in cavernous major league ballparks to spontaneous chants of ''Ru-dy! Ru-dy!'' in ordinary neighborhoods around the city, can't bring himself to exit gracefully.

Never before has a mayor of New York known such glory. News anchors genuflect before him. He is worshiped by network icons, from David Letterman to Barbara Walters to Larry King. Over the weekend he was a special guest on ''Saturday Night Live.'' And today he will address the U.N. General Assembly.

The script -- otherwise known as the lawfully constituted democratic process -- calls for Mr. Giuliani and his supporting cast to leave on Jan. 1. But with the audience crying ''Encore! Encore!'' hizzoner has got it into his alarmingly expanding head that the democratic process and more than two centuries of precedent should not be allowed to stand in the way of the city getting even more of the grandeur of himself.

In short, the mayor wants to stay. The odds were always against that. But -- in a revealing backstage moment that belied his newly formed sensitive public persona -- he approached the Democratic and Republican candidates for mayor with a club in his hand in an effort to get them to see things his way.
