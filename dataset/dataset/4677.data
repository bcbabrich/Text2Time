KITCHEN faucets receive hard use and can need repair as often as every few years. The good news is that, generally, little skill and few tools are needed to make these repairs, and replacement parts for most faucets are inexpensive and available at hardware stores.

Probably the most popular style of kitchen faucet has a single handle that controls both hot and cold water. Of these there of two common types, a ball faucet and a cartridge faucet. A ball faucet handle has a dome-shaped base; a cartridge faucet has a cylindrical top that fits over the handle.

If water flows only from one side of a faucet or pressure seems low, unscrew the aerator from the end of the spout and clean the screen inside. (Use pliers to remove the aerator and for other jobs described below; wrap the pliers' jaws with electrician's tape to prevent scratching soft metal surfaces.)

Other problems -- including leakage, difficulty adjusting water temperature, lack of extremely hot or extremely cold water, and hot water entering cold water outlets elsewhere in the plumbing, like toilet supply lines -- require disassembling the faucet and replacing some parts.
