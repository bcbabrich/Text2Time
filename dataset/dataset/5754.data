Thirty-seven Mozambicans were reported killed and 62 wounded today when rebels attacked a convoy of buses under military escort south of here. It was the third attack of its kind in two weeks in a war that will not go away.

The conflict, diplomats and other analysts said, is paralyzing a nation torn by successive conflicts for more than two decades, where sovereignty is so eroded so that the Government controls little more than cities and outlying outposts.

It is a war, one Western diplomat said, that seems stalemated, the rebels unable to penetrate the cities and Government forces unable to extend their writ into the countryside of this nation lying along the Indian Ocean in southern Africa.

Mozambican officials said the latest attack took place close to Manhica, 70 miles south of this crumbling whistle stop and only 30 miles north of the capital, Maputo.
