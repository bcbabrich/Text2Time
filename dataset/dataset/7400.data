A midtown travel agency was ordered yesterday by a Federal judge to produce books and records for a Civil Aeronautics Board investigation into cutrate trans‐Atlantic airline fares.

Judge David N. Edelstein ordered the agency, Treisser Tours of 10 West 47th Street, to comply with the order by Feb. 7.

Robert M. Morgenthau, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, sought the order to enforce a subpoena issued by the C A. B. Mr. Morgenthau said the agency's owner, Herman Treisser, had failed to produce the records as required.

Assistant United States Attorney Philip H. Schaeffer noted that the C. A. B. was looking into charges of rate‐cutting through rebates or concessions in violation of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.
