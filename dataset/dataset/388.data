Good morning. How you doing? Got your resolutions all ready for deployment today? Live healthier, be kinder, quit smoking or e-solitaire, learn Spanish, go to the museum more than twice a year? Eat at home more? Order takeout less? We wish you all best luck for this coming year, whatever your plans for improvement, though all we can really help with is your cooking, with Cooking.

So, shall we get started? If you don’t have plans already for a New Year’s Day feast — many in our circle are thinking of Kim Severson’s new recipe for peas and mustard greens in a smoky potlikker — you might consider making this recipe for rigatoni with white Bolognese sauce (above), which Amanda Hesser brought to The Times way back in 2002, after a trip to Rome. It’s incredible.

Other things we’d like to cook today or this weekend that we believe may interest you: Nigella Lawson’s recipe for roast pork loin with caraway, lemon and garlic; a sour-cream coffee cake for breakfast; these awesome bruschetta with creamed mushrooms and caramelized onions for a lunchtime feast; and, for dinner, Melissa Clark’s recipe for lentil salad with roasted vegetables.
