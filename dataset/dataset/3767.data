A Test for Christ the King

For the last seven seasons, Christ the King's nationally ranked girls' basketball team left little doubt that St. John Vianney, an elite team from New Jersey, was not on the same level.

Christ the King, ranked 16th in the nation by USA Today, has won all 11 meetings since they began playing in 1990.

''Christ the King has such a great program that very few teams can match up with them,'' Bill Bulman, a St. John Vianney assistant coach, said. ''They have always held a great advantage over us in the size and strength department.''

However, when St. John Vianney (11-0), the six-time defending state champion from Holmdel, N.J., travels across state lines today to take on Christ the King (12-2) in Middle Village, Queens, at 7:30 P.M., those advantages are expected to be no greater than the distance between a thumb and a bent index finger.
