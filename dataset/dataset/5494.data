I'M an election inspector.

Election inspectors, two from each major party, hang up the flag and unseal the voting machines at 6 o'clock in the morning on Election Day. At 9 o'clock in the evening we take down the flag, close the polls, count the vote, and reseal the machines. In the interim, we are charged with seeing that the election proceeds in a legal and orderly manner: No one may vote more than once. Anyone who is registered and still a resident may vote. No one may campaign in the voting area. No one should be trapped in the machine because they can't figure out how to open the curtain.

It isn't a complex job nor is it a dangerous one in our country today. It is a unique opportunity to observe American democracy operating at the very bottom of its grass roots.

Last Election Day, I witnessed the 15 hours of the general election in one election district in Westchester County. I'd like to report:

The election was legal and orderly. A substantial percentage of the registered voters in the district, people of all ages and parties and interests, came out to vote. Some of them were particularly notable.

More parents than ever before brought their young children to the polls. They brought them in order to take them into the voting booth and show them how to vote. Often there were four or six or even eight feet visible below the closed curtain . . . one pair of size 9's and a variety of much smaller ones. The children learned by explanation and by example how democracy works in our town and our country.
