So powerful has television become in the West that it has supplanted poster art as the major tool of mass persuasion. True, many European political parties still produce marvelous posters, and American groups that can't afford television spots still rely on posters. But nowadays, works such as the 1968 peace dove that Ben Shahn did for the Eugene McCarthy Presidential campaign seem designed less to win mass support than to warm the hearts of the already faithful.

Those with fond memories of such posters will have a chance to see some fine examples this weekend when the New York Poster, Postcard and Photograph show at the New York Sheraton features an exhibition of propaganda art.

Moving Tales of the War

Two of the most moving posters in the display, put together by the Chisholm Prats Gallery, are creations of Mr. Shahn. One depicts a hooded man against a brick wall about to be shot. The headline reads, ''This is Nazi Brutality,'' and superimposed on the picture is type from a Western Union wire reporting the slaughter of an entire village by the Nazis. A second shows a group of French workers, their arms over their heads, reading a Vichy decree requiring everyone to work for the war effort. The faces are a frightening mixture of impassivity and fear. The message on top - ''We French workers warn you ... defeat means slavery, starvation and death'' - is almost unnecessary. But you get the point.

The choice of the Chisholm Prats gallery to put together the show is fortunate, since Lucas Prats, one of the partners in the Greenwich Village concern, has assembled an extraordinary collection of Spanish Civil War posters. As George Orwell noted, Republican-controlled Spain was always awash in posters. They were the major medium of communication between the leftist-led Government, its often violently competitive factions and their following of poor and often illiterate workers and peasants.
