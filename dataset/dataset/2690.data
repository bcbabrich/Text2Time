Traditional terra cotta tagines have no glazing on the underside of the lid, to allow evaporating steam to be absorbed by the clay and concentrate the sauce. Now, new ones from Tangiers, Morocco, are completely glazed, but accomplish the same purpose with a tiny air vent for the escaping steam. They are also sturdier and have ridges in the dish to prevent food from sticking. The drawback is that the evaporation can happen too rapidly. ''Moroccan cooks put a sprig of thyme in the hole to reduce it,'' said Kim Koenig-Ouassil, above, with her husband, Rachid Ouassil. The couple sell the tagines at their Moroccan store, Sheherazade. They are $35, $45 and $55. The small size holds food for four. Sheherazade, which also sells decorative tagines used only for serving, is at 121 Orchard Street (Delancey Street) on the Lower East Side.
