The Dim Side of Love, With Just a Touch of Trash Congo Norvell Brownies

Congo Norvell, a band from Los Angeles that performed on Tuesday night, stalks the border zone between torch-song intimacy and lounge-band kitsch. From her bleached-blond hair to her heavily shadowed eyes to her sheer glittery blouse to her slowly swiveling hips, Sally Norvell had the right trash-goddess look; more important, she had the voice, smoky and aching but with a country belter's reserves of lung power. "Just when I think everything is fine, that's when you take everything of mine," she moaned in "Golden Gates," one of Congo Norvell's many self-immolating love songs.

Congo Norvell is led by Ms. Norvell and by Kid Congo Powers, who has played guitar for the Cramps, Nick Cave, the Gun Club and the Bad Seeds, all groups fascinated by the bleakest Americana, and all of them succumbing too often to cheesiness or pomposity.

Congo Norvell has more aplomb; since 1992, when it released its first EP, the band has refined its pose. Its songs stay slow and somber, with their stately vamps pierced by Mr. Powers's sustained, distorted guitar notes; Ms. Norvell paces herself, saving her most melodramatic outbursts for just a few moments in any song. "I'm glad we don't have any more intact illusions in this room," she said on Tuesday night, and the set wasn't over yet. JON PARELES
