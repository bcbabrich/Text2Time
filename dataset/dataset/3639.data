There was the inevitable klatch of celebrities, though the organizers' choices were a bit puzzling. Think about the extraordinary breadth of Jewish accomplishment in America. Then consider the headliners yesterday, who were mostly on the order of Joan Rivers and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. It made you wonder if you were supposed to sing ''Hatikvah,'' Israel's haunting national anthem, or ask for a taxi receipt.

BUT show biz was the surface gloss. It was really a day for reflection, on how far American Jews and Israel have come and on whether they can continue to give one another sustenance as they enter their sixth decade together.

If it is tensions you want, you don't have to look far.

Reform and Conservative Jews, who form a large majority of American Jews, feel they have been relegated to second-class status by the Orthodox rabbinate that controls Israeli religious life. Many Jews here fear that Israel's young Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is not truly interested in peace with the Arabs, no matter what he says. Fully half the American Jews surveyed by the New York-based Israel Policy Forum describe Israel as being ''on the wrong track.''

But differences over religion have plagued the marriage from the start. As for peace issues, you can safely bet that had Shimon Peres defeated Mr. Netanyahu in the 1996 Israeli election, there would have been at least as many unhappy American Jews, this time yelling that Israel was giving the store away to the Palestinians.

Friction is how each partner in the marriage lets the other know he is alive. In a crisis, they almost always come together in nothing flat. If there is a danger, many here and in Israel say, it is not so much that the partners bicker but that, increasingly, they seem not to have much to say to each other.
