For a penny, you could buy The New York Times on June 2, 1908, and read these stories on the front page:

The Mauretania beat the record of the Lusitania for fastest ocean crossing. Wilbur Wright got an offer of $100,000 for his flying machine. Teddy Roosevelt was jousting with Panama over the canal. A young, beautiful ''gray-garbed'' ghost was haunting the governor's mansion in Georgia. And big news from Philadelphia: ''Mrs. Frank Gould has lost several expensive gowns which she brought to this city to attend the Horse Show.''

My mother, Margaret Meenehan, was born on that distant day, before cellophane, airplane fatalities, rap and the Gap. I asked her to sum up 100 years in 500 words:

1900-1909: ''I learned to eat solid food.''

1910-1920: ''Washington was a small Southern village with horses and carriages. My father managed my uncle's bar, Meenehan's. There was a side entrance that said 'Ladies Only.' But women never really drank until Prohibition. We got one of the earliest automobiles in Washington, a black, seven-passenger Reo touring car. You had to crank it. We were also one of the first to have a telephone. My friend Betty didn't have a phone. So I would call her friends down the street who did, and they would run up to her house.

''During World War I, we would go out every Sunday for a drive around Arlington Cemetery and look at the thousands of crosses. The Germans used mustard gas. It blistered our boys' lungs. Pat McGuinn, a suitor of your Aunt Greta, was gassed.''

1920-1930. ''In January 1922, the roof of the Knickerbocker movie theater collapsed under the snow. There were snowbanks taller than I was. Ninety-eight people died watching a George M. Cohan comedy. A girl in my class, the brightest one, was killed. We prayed for her the next morning at Mass.
