The budget‐cutting action, already Postponed once as the board bargained for a reprieve from a city mandate to cut the money, included several measures that the Mayor's office considered to be “one‐shot” steps that failed to meet the requirements of the three‐year plan for the financial reorganization of the university system.

Alfred A. Giardino, the board chairman, opened and closed the brief special meeting with a statement noting that all members of the board had been “fully prepared to vote on this resolution on budget retrench. ment to cut $55 million this year.”

But he added that “after a series of meetings and at the request of representatives o the Mayor's office, and as re cently as late this afternoon the action has been deferred pending conversations between representatives of the city and the board.”
