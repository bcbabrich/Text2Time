A member of the United States Government's Holocaust Memorial Council announced today that he and more than a hundred other survivors of German death camps, here for a meeting of former inmates and resistance fighters, would cut short their attendance and fly to Germany to seek to bar Mr. Reagan's entry into Bergen-Belsen.

''If President Reagan changes his mind, we will be happy to accompany him to Bergen-Belsen,'' said Kalman Sultanik, an American who is also a vice president of the World Jewish Congress, in an interview. ''But if he doesn't, he will be able to go there only with the help of the German police.''

In discussing the withdrawal from Lebanon, which is to be completed in early June, Mr. Peres warned Syria against taking military advantage of Israel's pullout from the Bekaa region of eastern Lebanon, where for three years Syrian and Israeli troops have faced each other. He also said that Israel would not sit still if Syria tried to incite anti-Israeli forces in Lebanon to threaten his country's northern border.

'He'll Be in Trouble'

''If Assad gets us into trouble, he'll be in trouble,'' the Prime Minister said of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. He said that Israel had not sent such a warning to Syria, using the United States as intermediary, as is believed here. ''We don't feel the need to send a message,'' Mr. Peres said. ''They know.''

The Prime Minister said that future Israeli action toward Lebanon depended on Lebanese actions. He said Israel was ready to live in peace with all Lebanese - Shiite and Sunni Moslems as well as Christians and Druse.

He said he could not address his appeal for peaceful relations to the Lebanese national Government. ''All Lebanon is made up of local forces,'' he said. ''There is no national force.'' The Prime Minister said Israeli hope for border peace was based not, as it was before the invasion, on the creation of an irregular Lebanese force under Israeli control, but on a recognition by the various border communities that their interest was best served by resisting attempts to use their territory for anti-Israeli actions.

''Israel will defend herself in any way that is necessary,'' Mr. Peres said. ''The option to keep Lebanon completely free from our intervention is vested in their behavior.''
