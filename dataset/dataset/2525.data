While lobbying for the state to recognize cost and tax differences, the Long Island superintendent's position paper stresses an even-handed approach to school aid reform. ''Long Island superintendents are not interested in engaging in regional competition for dollars,'' the report states. ''While others in the state are promoting an atmosphere of divisiveness through flashy public relations campaigns, we believe that the needs of all children in New York State, no matter where they live, should be met through a fair state aid formula.''

The divisiveness referred specifically to a glossy poster put out by the Midstate School Finance Consortium, a group of upstate school districts. In bold letters, the poster states, ''Unfortunately, Some Kids Just Don't Get it,'' while each corner of the poster features a picture of a fifth-grade child and the cost of an education in his or her district. The costs and districts selected include: $9,851 in Nyack, on the Hudson; $4,973 in Sherburne-Earlville, a rural district south of Utica; $7,291 in Niagara Falls and $16,668 in Port Jefferson. Gary D. Bixhorn, the superintendent of Eastern Suffolk Boces and the chairman of the committee that drafted the Long Island report, said, ''Quite a few people were upset about the implications of that poster.'' The report states that while the average per-pupil expenditure on Long Island is $13,842, when that figure is adjusted by a cost-of-living index, the figure drops to $9,136, which is below the state median for regionally adjusted pupil expenditures.

But long before serious debate begins over where new education spending will come from and how it will be disbursed among the state's many school districts, state and local officials must first resolve budget questions for the 2004-05 fiscal year.

Long Island school officials said they were hopeful that negotiations on this year's budget and on a new state aid formula would go smoothly. Unlike in past years when Mr. Pataki has proposed major cuts to school aid, forcing state legislators to fight to restore funding, the governor this year has proposed a 1 percent increase -- an additional $147 million -- in education dollars.

Long Island educators said, though, that with salary, pension and insurance payments going up by as much as 8 percent, many school districts will be forced to raise property taxes again unless state legislators can extract more money out of the state budget for schools.

''We're certainly in a better position this year than we were a year ago, when we faced very heavy, drastic cuts,'' said Mark Schissler, superintendent of the Central Islip schools. ''But from our perspective a flat budget from the state is really a negative one because of increases that are out of our control. And if we don't see it from the state, then it gets borne by the individual homeowner.''

Superintendents also said that the governor's proposal to use revenue from video lottery terminals, which will start appearing next month at racetracks across the state, to pay for new school aid also provided a promising start to discussions on a new state aid formula. For one thing, they said, it makes clear that the governor intends to find new revenue to increase school spending in high-need districts.
