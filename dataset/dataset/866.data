Haruki Murakami’s next book, “The Strange Library,” sounds surreal and experimental even for an author whose work features talking cats, giant frogs and malicious miniature people.

“The Strange Library,” which will be published in the United States by Knopf this December, is narrated by a boy who visits a library on his way home from school. An old man takes the boy hostage and forces him to memorize a large number of books. The boy eventually realizes that the man plans to absorb the information he’s memorized by eating his brain. With the help of a strange girl and a man dressed as a sheep, the captive devises an escape plan. (Men dressed as sheep have cropped up in Mr. Murakami’s work before.)

In a news release announcing the acquisition on Tuesday, Knopf’s chairman and editor in chief, Sonny Mehta, called Mr. Murakami’s 96-page book “as scary and surprising as anything he has ever written.”

“The Strange Library” will arrive just three and a half months after Mr. Murakami’s latest novel, “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage,” which came out in the United States in August. It sold more than a million copies in Japan and is currently No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list for hardcover fiction.

“The Strange Library” may feel slight to some Murakami fans, especially those coming off his latest 400-plus page novel and his massive, 925-page novel “1Q84,” which was published in English in 2011. Knopf is fleshing out “The Strange Library” with full-color art throughout in a lavish volume designed by Chip Kidd, Knopf’s associate art director. Mr. Kidd said he drew on his own collection of vintage Japanese graphics as inspiration for the design.
