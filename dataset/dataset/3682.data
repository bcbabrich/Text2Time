To the Editor:

Kenneth W. Starr's choices in granting immunity reveal his true aim: to embarrass the President (front page, July 29).

Monica S. Lewinsky has been granted immunity from prosecution for a possible charge of lying under oath in order to trap the President on just such a charge. I can't see the logic in granting immunity to one person in order to prosecute another for the same crime. However, if Mr. Starr's motives are not to see that justice is done, but rather to skewer President Clinton, then the logic is clear.
