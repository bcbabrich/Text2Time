Orders to the nation's factories edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent in November, the weakest showing in three months, the Commerce Department said today.

The report prompted some concern about a possible slowdown in manufacturing in the aftermath of the October stock market collapse.

The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and nondurable goods rose to $209.66 billion in November after increases of 1.3 percent in October and 1.8 percent in September. A Decline in August

The November gain was the poorest performance since orders fell 1.4 percent in August.

Some economists said they were particularly concerned about an 18.5 percent plunge in orders for computers and other office equipment, suggesting that businesses might be showing increased caution about spending.
