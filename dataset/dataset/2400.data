Attention, theatrical birdwatchers. A couple of rare species will be on view this summer at the Stratford Festival in Canada. "The Lark," Jean Anouilh's rarely seen meditation on the life of Joan of Arc, will land on the festival stage at the end of July. Starring in the production will be another elusive creature, Amanda Plummer, whose infrequent stage appearances are always worth noting. (Ms. Plummer was last seen in New York in Tracy Letts's "Killer Joe" back in 1998; she withdrew from his play "Bug," an Off Broadway hit from last year, shortly before it opened.) Although Ms. Plummer will be making her Stratford Festival debut, her arrival is a homecoming of sorts. Now the whole family will have played Stratford. Her parents -- Christopher Plummer and Tammy Grimes -- are both alums. Her father's triumphant performance in "King Lear" was a highlight of recent Stratford seasons, and theater buffs may also recall that Mr. Plummer appeared in the original Broadway production of "The Lark" in 1955, playing the Earl of Warwick opposite Julie Harris's Joan of Arc. The Stratford production, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, will use the same Lillian Hellman adaptation, but this time, Joan's trial will unfold against the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. "The Lark," which runs from July 31 to Oct. 29, opens at the Festival Theater on Aug. 11. (800) 567 1600, www.stratfordfestival.ca CHARLES ISHERWOOD
