''Whatever is said about this project in the years to come, certainly no one can say that the city acted rashly or without due deliberation.''

-- Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, in 1972, at a groundbreaking ceremony for the Second Avenue subway, first proposed in 1920 and still unfinished today.

As you read this, $4.5 billion in federal money circles high above New York City in a holding pattern. Anxiously awaiting its landing are public officials and business leaders who have effectively already spent this money three times over, at least in their minds, as they begin anxiously ''re-imagining'' the transportation landscape in Lower Manhattan.

Arranged in no particular order of likelihood, there are plans to build a downtown station like Grand Central Terminal, to create a subterranean concourse with stores and cafes and moving sidewalks, to rebuild the South Street Ferry station, to connect the two Rector Street subway stations, to rebuild the Fulton Street complex, to submerge West Street into a traffic tunnel, to build new ferry terminals, and, if they can find the room, to bring the Long Island Rail Road and maybe even Metro-North into Lower Manhattan.

With these plans in mind, and with the unmistakable background music of knives being sharpened, the Tunnel Vision column thought it might be a good time to take a brief tour of the metropolitan region with the Ghost of Transit Plans Past.
