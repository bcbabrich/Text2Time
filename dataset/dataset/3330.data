Mr. Black has sent mixed signals about newspapers. In April, he said he wanted to sell his Canadian weeklies and smaller dailies. But with today's announcement, he is selling newspapers that dominate some of Canada's most important markets, including The Ottawa Citizen, The Gazette of Montreal, The Calgary Herald, The Edmonton Sun and The Vancouver Province.

If the sale goes through as expected in late September, Mr. Black, 55, will have tailored his press fief to ownership of newspapers in prestige cities that he cares about: The Daily Telegraph in London, The Jerusalem Post and The Chicago Sun-Times. As for his pet Canadian project, The National Post, a Toronto-based newspaper that in less than two years of existence has added a muscular conservative voice to Canada's intellectual debate, Mr. Black is to become the newspaper's chairman for five years and Hollinger is to retain management control. CanWest will own 50 percent of this newspaper.

Mr. Black was on vacation in Europe and did not return telephone calls left at his Toronto and New York offices. But in his press statement, he seemed to expect criticism.

''There continues to be an audible body of opinion that holds that the newspaper industry has entered a period of stagnation or even decline,'' said Mr. Black, who is Hollinger's chairman. ''We strenuously disagree with this and look forward to demonstrating both the fallacy of this view and the enduring vitality of quality newspaper assets intelligently managed and imaginatively linked with other media.''

Don Babick, The Post publisher, declined in an interview to predict how the marriage of electronic and print media would happen, saying only, ''We are blending ourselves with a first-class national telecaster.''

The deal would strengthen the news-gathering capacity of CanWest, making it ''far and away the leading Canadian media operation,'' said Mr. Dornan, a former television journalist. ''These guys are going to have the most robust news rooms in every single market in the country.''

CanWest estimated that the combined strengths of the merged operations could save the company up to $100 million a year.
