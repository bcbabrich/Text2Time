Dr. Susan G. Nayfield, program director for the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., said, "In women who take tamoxifen following surgery for breast cancer, we have observed a drop in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or bad cholesterol, that begins within about two weeks of initiating the drug."

"What this study does," she said, "is tell us that in women taking tamoxifen, there are fewer hospitalizations due to heart disease, which essentially means less suffering from heart disease. And it makes us confident that the cardiovascular benefits are more than just a laboratory finding, that they translate into real experiences of real women."

Women in the study group were followed for up to 13 years, with a median follow-up period of six years. Those who received tamoxifen for two years had almost one-third fewer hospital admissions for heart disease than those in a comparison group. Those who took the drug for five years had almost two-thirds fewer admissions than those who took tamoxifen for only two years.

More than one million women worldwide are believed to be taking tamoxifen to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence, and some women have taken the drug for more than 10 years. Nevertheless, researchers want to determine the long-term effects of tamoxifen use. Several previous studies have hinted at increased risk of uterine, liver and other cancers.

Dr. Bernard Fisher, chairman of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project and a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has begun recruiting women for the national Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. The five-year study will examine the preventive benefits of tamoxifen in 16,000 women over the age of 35 who are considered at high risk of developing breast cancer. So far 9,000 women have been recruited.
