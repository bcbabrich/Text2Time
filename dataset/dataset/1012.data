GUMPORT--Margot Loebl, a high school science teacher at the Dalton school for over 50 years and widow of Dr. Stephen L. Gumport, died peacefully at home following a brief illness aged 89 on June 28 with her children at her side. Mrs. Gumport attended the Dalton school (Class of 1941), Bennington College (Class of 1945), and did graduate work in biochemistry at Columbia University. From 1947 to 1948 she worked as an assistant in biochemistry at Memorial Hospital and for the next decade she did biochemical research at Cornell Medical School. She returned to Dalton in 1959 as a teacher. During her Dalton career she taught chemistry, biology, physics, and French and served for many years as the chair of the science department and dean of the high school. Mrs. Gumport retired from teaching at Dalton in January of this year. In addition to teaching, Mrs. Gumport was formerly president of National New York Packing and Shipping Company, a shipping and expediting company founded by her father, Andrew W. Loebl. Her mother, the former Florence Weinberg, was an artist. The family is particularly grateful for the loving care provided throughout Margot's last days by her helper of many years, Angela Mariussi. She was predeceased by her youngest son, Daniel, and survived by sons Leonard, Michael, and Jonathan, nine grandchildren, and her god-daughter Liza Kronenberger Wanklyn. In lieu of flowers, her family suggests donations be made to The Dalton School. A memorial service is being planned for September.
