Bert Houle and Sophie Wibaux write that ''Mime is the art of touch, not intellectual or physical, but emotional touch.'' Mr. Berky, a clown-mime, unabashedly is ''interested as a performer in the transformation of audience from passive observers to active participants.'' Mr. Pitt's invitation to respond to the undefined is a variant of the same concern.

Although mime today draws from various techniques and sources and may look less dance-like, it resembles dance more than before in conceptual framework. Like ballet, and thanks largely to Mr. Decroux, mime has a codified vocabulary that can be a base of technique. Like modern-dance, mime now feels free to reject an academic base and to invent new forms.

The wave-length between modern-dance and mime experimentalists is similar. Mimes must choreograph their own works, like modern-dancers. Although some of these mimes present set pieces by Mr. Decroux as an homage, they are usually involved in new work.

The main issue on which the new mimes differ is whether emotion or intellect should predominate. Here they might refer to the dual tradition represented by Deburau - adored by French intellectuals and masses alike. Descended from the fairground (he was a tightrope walker) he is the ancestor of avant-garde clowns like Mr. Irwin and Mr. Berky.

The chief break with mime of the past may have been overlooked by the new practitioners. This is the shift from the pictorial to the animate. The mimes of Greek and Roman drama focused on the idea of arrested motion. As the dance historian, Marian Hannah Winter has noted, this base prevailed even in the mime dramas of the famed choreographer Salvatore Vigano in the early 19th century. Until Deburau, mime was ''dominated by canons of painting and sculpture since the days of Greek masks'' and stock gestures expressed the same emotions repeatedly. Actors in plays and dancers in Vigano's productions used the same stance and gestures.

This was, in effect, silent acting. I would submit that when mime became more dance-like and used the whole body, it re-found its essence. Perhaps this is the key to the definition of mime that no one seems willing to secure permanently. Asked to define the difference between mime and dance, Mr. Decroux once told Mr. Leabhart:

''Rhythm in mime is the exception, while in dance it is the rule. Rhythm might be imposed on a work of mime in order to unify it but the work itself is based on surprise, dramatic hesitation - the mime must be born and grow slowly. We see dance living onstage but we never know how it is born or how it dies. To dance is to not show us the birth of dance . . . The traditional figure of the dancer is free and soaring; the typical figure of the mime is struggling and earthbound.''

What Mr. Decroux did not take into account were the premises of modern-dance, as opposed to ballet. Familiar with modern-dance, the young American mimes have borrowed many of its ideas - rejecting the aerial in ballet when they wish and, like other experimentalists, showing a concern with process. Too often, they say, mimes have imposed constraints on their own art. Hence the need, Mr. Pitt argues, for breaking down boundaries. This has already happened with what he calls hyphenated art forms such as ''Mime-Dance, Clown-Mime, Jazz-Ballet and Dance-Theater.'' Mime will still be practiced as before but, he predicts, ''the most exciting work will be done by those who take the risk of stepping to the edge of their art form . . . This means that as mime opens up at the seams, it will lose some of its identifiable earmarks.'' Too narrow in the past, the art form thus stands to be enriched. Mr. Pitts poses a paradox worth pondering.
