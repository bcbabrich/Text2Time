The potential for comparison is not lost on Mr. Pataki, who has been reading Edmund Morris's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt." "I did chuckle and see a possible historic parallel," he said recently, referring to Mr. Morris's anecdote about Roosevelt and Platt. "But there are a lot of changes that have occurred in the past 90 years and I have no intention of submitting lists of appointees to anyone."

Mr. Pataki said he first fell under Roosevelt's spell as an undergraduate at Yale, where he took an American history course from John Morton Blum, the editor of Roosevelt's voluminous letters and the author of several books about the 33d Governor and the 26th President. Mr. Pataki said he remembered that Mr. Blum drew contrasts between three competing philosophies of American government in the early 20th century.

"There were the anti-government Republicans, who were the Charles Sumner social Darwinists, and that has been always something that I find appalling, that a person's worth is based on their success and financial reward," Mr. Pataki said. "There was the big government Wilsonian Democrats, that you create an agency to regulate something. And then there was Roosevelt, who rejected both of those and had the concept that I think was correct, which is an activist government that looks not to regulate markets or people's lives in an ongoing way, but looks to make sure that the system functions fairly and in the interest of all of the people.

"I just really thought then that that concept, where you don't just sit back passively and let events take their course, but on the other hand you allow private sector choices and individual responsibility to maximize opportunity, was what Roosevelt stood for."

In tribute to Roosevelt, Mr. Pataki named his eldest son Theodore, and both his house in Garrison and his State Senate office have stern-looking portraits of Roosevelt. Some lobbyists seeking insight into their new Governor have started to read Roosevelt biographies, although Albany bookstores do not report a surge in interest in those titles. But Peter Scanlan, an Albany dealer of political memorabilia, said a prospective officeholder recently browsed through his store looking for a Roosevelt collectible to give Mr. Pataki as a gift.
