President Reagan began 1983 with a plea that the nation get its drunken drivers ''off our roads and get them off now.''

''If we insist long enough and loudly enough, we can save lives, so I thought it appropriate to start the ball rolling on this, the first day of the new year,'' the President said today in his weekly radio address.

The New Year's Day speech was recorded for broadcast today, hours after New Year's Eve celebrations.

25,000 Die Each Year

The President said that approximately 25,000 lives are lost each year in alcohol-related accidents and 650,000 more people are seriously injured in such crashes. He said alcohol was a factor in 55 percent of fatal automobile accidents.
