The British Petroleum Company, Ltd., realized a 74 per cent increase in third‐quarter earnings on a sales gain of 26.7 per cent, the report from London headquarters disclosed yesterday. The results for the nine months ended with September showed earnings up 108.5 per cent and sales 30.3 per cent ahead of last year's figures.

Third‐quarter net income of $87‐million, equalled 24 cents a share and compared with $50million or 14 cents a share for the similar three months last year. Net sales were $1.23‐billion, up from $973‐million.

Primarily due to the recession of industrial activity in Europe, product sales fell below expectation towards the end of the third quarter and are continuing at a reduced level during the fourth quarter, the company said. This fall in demand has caused product prices to be affected in some areas, it explained.

Net income for the nine months to Sept. 30 rose to $294‐million or 81 cents a share, more than double the $141‐million or 39 cents a share earned in the first nine months of 1970. Net sales were $3.74billion compared with $2.87billion last year.
