Just before Thursday’s vice-presidential debate, four independent groups have been trying to seed public opinion by running advertisements that are critical of Gov. Sarah Palin and Senator John McCain.

Campaign Money Watch, a watchdog group, produced a spot focusing on Mr. McCain’s involvement in the Keating Five scandal, in which Mr. McCain, of Arizona, was accused of improperly exerting influence on regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, the high-flying financier and campaign contributor whose savings and loan collapse cost taxpayers $2 billion.

The spot is fairly tame, but dredges up a scandal that Mr. McCain would rather forget, particularly as Americans are struggling to accept, the government’s proposed $700 billion bailout of financial institutions.

The Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund is behind a graphic 60-second advertisement attacking Ms. Palin’s stance on the aerial hunting of wolves.

“As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,” a narrator says.

The spot then follows with what appears to be video from a wolf hunt, showing grainy images of two men in a small plane who shoot a wolf from the air. The wolf then barrels into the ground, writhing in pain on the snow.

The advertisement concludes with a picture of a dead wolf hanging from the wing of a plane, beneath the text, “Do we really want a Vice President who champions such savagery?”

Planned Parenthood has produced a 30-second spot focusing on Ms. Palin’s tenure as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska.

It begins with a shot of a young, dark-haired woman named Gretchen who identifies herself as a rape victim.

The narrator begins, “Under Mayor Sarah Palin, women like Gretchen were forced to pay up to $1,200 for the emergency exams used to prosecute their attackers.”

Independent fact-checkers have examined the controversy over rape kits. PolitiFact, the fact-checking arm of The St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly, found that while the policy was in place while Ms. Palin was mayor, there is no evidence that she directly endorsed the policy, nor that she ever commented on the policy.

Perhaps the harshest of the advertisements is a 30-second spot produced by the 85,000-member California Nurses Association and running in closely contested states. It is a full-fledged swipe at Mr. McCain’s age and health, and a direct attack on Ms. Palin’s readiness to take over as president if necessary.

At one point, the spot shows Mr. McCain before a black background and a pulsing signal from a heart-rate monitor that turns into a flat line.

“One heartbeat, one heartbeat, one heartbeat away,” a chorus cheerfully sings.

Even opponents of Mr. McCain are likely to find such a graphic reference to his health offensive, undermining the message of the advertisement.
