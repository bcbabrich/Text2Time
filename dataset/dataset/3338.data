In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, the clearinghouses for the two markets introduced a plan today that would cut settlement costs by 90 percent for certain trades.

Brokers have expressed concern about the potential for escalating costs should the London and Frankfurt exchanges combine to form a pan-European bourse called iX. Winning the support of brokers is crucial for the London Stock Exchange in its attempts to ward off a hostile bid from OM Gruppen A.B., the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm stock exchange.

''It's a good workable blueprint,'' said Brian Mairs, a spokesman for the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.

While today's proposal went a long way toward addressing shareholder concerns, questions about how the savings would be achieved and who would benefit the most underscore the difficulty that European stock exchanges were facing as they tried folding dissimilar technologies and regulations into one entity. A certain amount of overlap in terms of how trades are settled has led some shareholders of the London Stock Exchange to call the proposal a political Band-Aid, rather than the most economically viable solution.
