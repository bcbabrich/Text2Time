Panama's decision to break off earlier talks through the Inter‐American Peace Committee and take her charge to the Council has deeply disturbed Latin‐American Governments. As a result new high‐level attempts to find a solution to the dispute are expected.

In what was regarded as the most violent attack by a LatinAmerican government on the United States since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba, Mr. Moreno said: “We shall live under the constant threat of an armed North American attack.”

He contended that as long as the “justice” of Panama's demands for a revision of the 1903 Canal Zone treaty were not met, “the aggression remains latent along the border that separates the zone of the canal from the rest of the republic.”

“The armed forces of the United States are there in a state of alert to halt the people of Panama in the exercise of its rights,” Dr. Moreno said, and then asked:

“Can the sister countries of America leave Panama abandoned to her own fate, at the mercy of the will of a power filled with its own strength and that has demonstrated that it is disposed not to recognize the rights of the Panamanian nation and, what is worse, to force it to submit to injustice through force?”

Specifically, Mr. Moreno asked the Council to constitute itself a ministerial‐level “organ of consultation,” order an investigation of the Canal Zone riots and condemn the United States for “aggression.”
