Today’s puzzle title refers to four groups formed at famous institutions of higher learning between 98 and 170 years ago. That’s a long time to wait to make it into a Times crossword, but if you’re a member of any of them, it’s a good day to celebrate. Reach into the back corner of your closet. I’m sure your toga is still there.

Someone with more knowledge of fraternal social organizations than I possess will have to explain why these four in particular are honored.

In the early 19th century, she held the controversial belief that education and employment opportunities should be available to both sexes.

This is a smooth puzzle; just what we’ve come to expect from Patrick Berry.

Now that you’ve finished the puzzle, why not ride the wild surf with Jan and Dean?
