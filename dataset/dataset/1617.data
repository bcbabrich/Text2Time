The Public Theater, which has struggled to raise money to mount its critically successful revival of the counterculture musical “Hair” on Broadway, announced on Thursday that Jeffrey Richards and Jerry Frankel, the producing team behind the Tony Award-winning musical “Spring Awakening,” had agreed to serve together as the lead producers. Elizabeth I. McCann, who had been the show’s lead producer since the Public began working to move the production to Broadway, will continue with the project, but in a reduced role that was not spelled out by Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater. Mr. Eustis also announced that Eden Espinosa would join the Broadway cast in the leading role of Sheila. To accommodate Mr. Richards and Mr. Frankel, opening night, which had been set for March 5, has been moved back to March 31, at the Al Hirschfeld Theater on West 45th Street.
