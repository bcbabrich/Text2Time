Brad Daugherty, a senior guard, scored 19 points and North Carolina posted a record fourth straight 100-point game to beat Florida State, 109-64, in college basketball tonight.

The Tar Heels (13-0) grabbed a 52-25 halftime lead and never looked back as they reached the 100-point mark for the seventh time this season.

It was the first time in the school's 74-year basketball history that the Tar Heels had four consecutive 100-point games.

North Carolina, which led by as many as 47 points in the second half, took the lead for good at 12-10 on a layup by Jeff Lebo with 14 minutes 6 seconds left in the first half. The Tar Heels hit 60 percent from the field and the Seminoles connected on only 37.9 percent.
