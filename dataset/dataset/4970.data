So-called instant concrete products are about twice as costly, but they harden much faster - in as little as five minutes - and allow fencing to be attached in about an hour.

For fence posts made of 4x4-inch lumber (or posts whose ends can be trimmed to that size), an alternative installation method is to use post supports, which are available from fence suppliers. These are steel sockets that taper to a point; they can be driven into the ground with a sledge hammer or embedded in concrete. Afterward, the fence post is driven into the socket. To repair a wobbly but undecayed post set in soil, saw a four-foot length of 2x4 lumber into four two-foot-long wedges, each measuring about one and a half inches square at the thick end. Soak these for 24 hours in copper naphthenate wood preservative, which is available at home centers.

Drive the wedges into the ground along each side of the post, and then bind the wedges and post together by twisting metal wire tightly around them.

If a post set in soil wobbles because it has decayed below ground, dig a hole alongside it. Add stones and install a short length of new post (preservative-treated and angled across the top) beside the rotten one. The new post should rise about a foot above ground level. Next, drill two to four holes at least three-eighths of an inch in diameter through both posts. Fasten the posts together with galvanized carriage bolts.

Fill the new post hole with soil, stones or concrete, then saw through the decayed post below the bolts to slow further decay.

To strengthen posts set in concrete, cast an above-ground extension of the base. If the post is decayed inside the old concrete, first drill several three-quarter-inch holes slanting from the lowest areas of sound wood downward toward the center of the post.

Fill the holes with copper naphthenate preservative to halt advancing decay.

Wash the top of the existing concrete with detergent, scrub it with a stiff brush and then rinse. Drive about six 2-inch masonry nails part way into the concrete, and also several into the sides of the post three to five inches above ground, to provide a grip for the new concrete. A note of caution: Wear goggles when hammering. Using plywood or boards, build a four-sided bottomless box about eight inches high around the post as a form for the new concrete. The inside of the form should be at least two inches from the post on all sides.
