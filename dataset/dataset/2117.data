Talk has abounded in political circles recently about the relationship between Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general. That relationship is said to be strained after Mr. Cuomo’s investigation this summer of efforts by Mr. Spitzer’s aides to generate negative news stories on the travels on state aircraft by the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno.

So many people at today’s state Democratic Party meeting in Garden City were watching closely as Mr. Spitzer, finishing his speech, came down from the stage — just 10 feet away from Mr. Cuomo, who was sitting in a front-row seat and was next to speak. Mr. Spitzer strode away through a side door without nary a handshake shared with his fellow Democrat. Routine behavior or meaningful gesture? We’ll let the Albany Kremlinologists among you decide what just happened on Long Island.

Mr. Spitzer got away from the conference center without taking questions from reporters. For his part, Mr. Cuomo praised Mr. Spitzer in his speech, and played down talk of a rift when speaking with reporters afterward.

“One speaker finishes and leave; the next speaker starts,” Mr. Cuomo said. Pressed by a reporter, he said: “I didn’t think people read into a rivalry. I don’t think there is a rivalry. So I don’t think you’d have to compensate for one because I don’t think it exists in the first place.”

Also playing down suggestions of discomfort between the two men was the state party chairwoman, June O’Neill.

“There’s a great Abe Lincoln quote: How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg?” she said. “The answer is four. Calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg.”
