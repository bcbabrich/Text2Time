Facing another looming budget gap, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday ordered New York City's agencies to prepare to cut spending by 7.5 percent for the fiscal year that begins next July. The Mayor's order would eliminate 4,500 jobs through attrition and raise the specter of more reductions in services used by millions of New Yorkers.

The proposed cut would fall hardest on the Board of Education, the city's largest agency, which under yesterday's order must cut about $180 million in the city's share of its budget, which is roughly half of the school system's total budget of $7.3 billion. But the proposed reductions could also affect agencies from the Department of Parks and Recreation, which faces a cut of about $10 million, to the Department of Sanitation, with a proposed cut of $40 million.

The budget-balancing plan announced yesterday will almost certainly be modified before the next budget is enacted. But if past experience is a guide, the budget gap is more likely to grow in the coming months than to shrink.

In a letter outlining his initial plans to balance the budget for the next fiscal year, the Mayor also signaled his intent to press Gov. George E. Pataki to make still deeper cuts in state and city spending on welfare and health care for the city's poorest residents. That would save the city $675 million.
