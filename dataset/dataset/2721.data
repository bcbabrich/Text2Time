Amy Sue Rosen and Peggy Peloquin

Dance Theater Workshop

The metaphor of the body as a house or landscape is a peculiarly rich one for dance. Two choreographers explored it in different ways in works by Amy Sue Rosen and Peggy Peloquin that runs through tomorrow at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea.

Notes for Ms. Peloquin's new ''Strategies Stabilizing,'' which opened the program on Feb. 21, included the poem ''Question,'' by May Swenson. What will she do, Swenson writes, when ''Body my house my horse my hound'' is fallen? The dance does not provide an answer. Instead, it juxtaposes a loping, sinking, meditative woman (Ms. Peloquin) with two other women (Kelly Eudailey and Daniella Hoff), whose bodies complement each other like puzzle pieces, limbs conversing precisely under hanging gauze carcasses designed by Matt Gagnon.

''Strategies Stabilizing'' is set to music by C. Hyams-Hart. The handsome video is by Peter Richards, with lighting by Phil Sandstr√∂m and costumes by Liz Prince.

''Break/Broke,'' choreographed by Ms. Rosen with visual designs by Derek Bernstein, a painter and longtime collaborator, does address Swenson's question. There is nothing to be done, this profoundly simple piece suggests, about the familiar constants of sickness and death.
