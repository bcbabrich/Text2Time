Re "The Fed's Latest Mistake" by Sam Nakagama (Op-Ed, May 19):

We must hope Mr. Nakagama is wrong in his belief that the Federal Reserve Board erred in raising short-term interest rates half a percentage point May 17. I believe he is.

Granted that the economy is not growing as fast as some estimates of its performance would have us believe, but it is expanding at a pretty high rate. Judged by the coincident indicators, which are more sensitive and timely than the gross domestic product figures, it looks to be growing at around 3.5 percent a year, even a bit faster.

That is, of course, a catch-up rate, and needs, one way or another, to be moderated to a speed that can be continued for an extended period without exceeding the practical limits of capacity and becoming seriously inflationary.

It is pretty obvious that the Fed was trying to slow growth to a sustainable pace, without counterproductive increases in borrowing costs, perhaps even without having the mythical "wealth effect" of which Mr. Nakagama speaks. And the Fed may well have done it. Is it not interesting and relevant in this connection that, after what the Fed did, long-term borrowing costs dropped and the stock market went up?
