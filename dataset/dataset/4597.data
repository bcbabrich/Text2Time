One cannot count on strong players' sticking to strategies they have used before. In studying their games, one must, of course, master the ones for which they are best known, but the work cannot stop there.

Nor can one adopt a defense just because the opponent has relied on a line of play that one feels safe in facing. Strong players are self-critical, and those that convince themselves that their previous performances against a specific defense have left something to be desired will alter course without warning. So schooling oneself in one-tenth of a defense is not good enough; one must digest it all.

Every once in a while, even a very experienced player forgets that point.

In the 10th round of the Hoogoven "B" Tournament from Jan. 9 to 25 in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, David Bronstein of Russia, who had played a tie match for the world championship in 1951 and should know all about such things, readied one splinter of a defense to play against Patrick Wolff. When Wolff, a 24-year-old grandmaster from Belmont, Mass., changed his attack, Bronstein revealed his omission by taking an hour and 20 minutes for his first 18 moves.

And they weren't good ones, either, as Wolff forcefully showed.

Against the Lasker-Pelikan variation of the Sicilian Defense with 5 . . . e5, Wolff had earlier in the tourney played 9 Nd5 Be7 10 Ne7 Ne7 11 Bd3 and had not achieved anything for Black to worry about. Bronstein was wrongly expecting a repetition of that, but when Wolff switched to the main line, 9 Bf6 gf (9 . . . Qf6?! 10 Nd5 Qd8 11 c4 is positionally potent for White because 11 . . . b4? 12 Qa4 Bd7 13 Nb5! ab 14 Qa8 Qa8 15 Nc7 Kd8 16 Na8 Nd4 17 Rc1 gains a rook for a knight) 10 Nd5, Bronstein had to struggle to recall it.
