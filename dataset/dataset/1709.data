As expected, Michael Jackson had several of the best-selling albums in the country last week as fans rushed to stores and download services in the days after his death last Thursday.

Three titles by Mr. Jackson each had more than 100,000 sales in the United States in the week that ended Sunday: “Number Ones” sold 108,000, “The Essential Michael Jackson” sold 102,000 and “Thriller” — which was reissued last year in multiple commemorative versions — sold 101,000, according to preliminary sales data from Nielsen SoundScan that was reported by Billboard. (Mr. Jackson’s music is released by divisions of Sony Music Entertainment.) By contrast, the top-selling new album was the Black Eyed Peas‘ “The E.N.D.” (Interscope), with 88,000 copies.

But because of Billboard’s rules, Mr. Jackson’s albums do not qualify for the Billboard 200, its standard albums chart, because they were all released more than 18 months ago. Instead, the Black Eyed Peas album is at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and Mr. Jackson occupies the top nine slots on the Billboard catalog chart, as either a solo artist or member of the Jackson 5, a record for that chart.

In total, Mr. Jackson sold 415,000 albums in the United States last week, according to the preliminary numbers; final numbers are expected on Wednesday. The week before, he sold only 10,000, and last week’s total is 40 percent more than Mr. Jackson’s entire catalog had sold for the year up to June 21, Billboard reported Tuesday night.

A remarkable 2.6 million songs by Mr. Jackson as a solo act or with the Jackson 5 were downloaded digitally through last Sunday, the standard end of the sales week of the SoundScan tracking service, upon whose numbers Billboard bases its charts. (Downloads for the week before were 48,000.) A total of 58 percent of the sales last week were downloads, and Mr. Jackson has become the first artist to sell more than a million song downloads in a single week.

Many retailers reportedly ran out of available stock of CD’s, and for days after Mr. Jackson’s death his albums occupied most of the top slots on the running music sales charts for iTunes and Amazon.com.
