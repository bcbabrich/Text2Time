Mr. Schumer said the ''chronic lack of communication between federal and local authorities undermines efforts to protect the homeland.'' He said the lack of cooperation was '' nothing new,'' but had become unacceptable after Sept. 11. He and Senator Leahy cited Attorney General John Ashcroft's warning on Monday of an impending terrorist attack, issued without telling local law enforcement what to watch for.

Senator Clinton said: ''We need to cut through the bureaucratic and turf battles that sometimes prevent good, solid communications. We need to cut through the fog of war here at home by ensuring that local police authorities have the information that they need.''

The recently enacted terrorism legislation allowed federal authorities to share information from grand juries, wiretaps, foreign intelligence operations, and confidential banking and educational records with other federal agents who could use it to prevent crimes. The Schumer-Clinton bill would permit, but not require, federal authorities to share such information with state and local police and governors.

Mr. Schumer conceded that the legislation would not immediately erase the F.B.I.'s traditional reluctance to share information. But he said, ''By eliminating the legal barriers, we eliminate an excuse.''

Mr. Leahy said that once the measure became law, he would use oversight hearings to make sure that federal authorities understood its importance. ''Nothing focuses the attention of a regional director,'' he said, more than knowing ''they have to come down here and testify about how it is working.'' He also said he would travel to New York on Friday to discuss the issue with the head of the F.B.I.'s office in the city.
