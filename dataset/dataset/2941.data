Pressed by Congressional Democrats, the White House has begun disgorging new information about the administration's extensive contacts with Enron executives. Alberto Gonzales, counsel to President Bush, asserted recently that the evidence showed that officials had responded in ''appropriate and responsible'' ways whenever they were in touch with the giant energy company, which collapsed last winter. But Mr. Gonzales's comment reflects precisely what is wrong with this picture. In Washington it is considered perfectly ''appropriate'' for officials to grant access to a company that used vast campaign donations to influence policy.

The administration says there is no evidence that Enron appealed to White House officials during its financial crisis. Last fall the administration said that Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans had rebuffed Enron's requests for help. Quite properly, however, investigators are seeking evidence that Enron sought to influence policy in less explicit ways that would have helped its balance sheet. The administration's penchant for secrecy, including Vice President Dick Cheney's refusal to provide records of contacts with his energy task force, has not banished suspicions in this regard. Enron and its employees gave more than $1 million to Mr. Bush's campaign, the Republican Party and the Bush inaugural. The company jet was used by Bush aides in the campaign and the post-election dispute in Florida.

The most generous Enron donor was Kenneth Lay. The latest information shows that while Mr. Lay was Enron's C.E.O. he was practically a fixture at the White House, attending the inaugural, the Easter egg rolling, T-ball games and other events large and small. The Senate Government Affairs Committee, headed by Joseph Lieberman, would like to know more about Mr. Lay's role in lobbying for policy and personnel changes at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The commission was crucial to Enron's hopes to reduce or eliminate regulation in energy markets in California and elsewhere. The T.V.A. had fought with Enron over electricity contracts. Also, the administration supported Enron's position in opposing energy price caps during the California power crisis.

The administration needs to be more forthcoming on the evolution of its energy policies as well, many of which mirrored Enron recommendations. The White House likes to point to the number of instances when it did not take Enron's view on energy. That's fair, but the public is entitled to all the information so that cases of undue influence can be identified and examined. The phenomenon of a wealthy company using its riches to influence government policy and protect itself from financial ruin needs to be understood in all its dimensions.
