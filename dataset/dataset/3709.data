First, let's clean up some language. There was no bailout because the Fed turned over no taxpayer money to the fund.

Long-Term Capital is a hedge fund, a type of investment fund that caters only to investors who are rich and sophisticated. The investors raised a few billion dollars of their own and borrowed tens of billions more from banks and securities firms like Merrill Lynch. For three years its investment strategy worked brilliantly, but its investments soured this year. Because the firm had borrowed to the hilt, losses turned to disaster when creditors demanded their money.

That, says Prof. George Benston of Emory University, ''sets up a classic free-rider problem.'' Each creditor grabs for its money while there is still money to grab. But if all the creditors grab at once, the fund will be forced to sell assets hastily, guaranteeing stupendous losses. A fire sale of securities would put the fund in about the same position as a family forced to sell its suburban mansion in 24 hours.

''What Mr. McDonough appears to have done,'' Mr. Benston suggests, ''is to use the credibility of the Fed to bring the creditors together for their mutual benefit.'' Working together, they can keep the fund alive at least long enough to sell off its assets in an orderly, patient and perhaps even profitable manner.

A bailout for the rich? For all the prattle, the fact is that the partners come away nearly empty-handed. The creditors, a consortium of banks and securities firms, have pledged to put up $3.6 billion in exchange for 90 percent ownership. Moral hazard? The deal nearly wipes out the misbehaving speculators and forces inattentive creditors to fork over money and take over the wreckage they indirectly sponsored. This deal hardly offers comfort for repeat offenders.
