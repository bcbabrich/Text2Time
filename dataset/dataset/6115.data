William Kaiser, chief engineer of the superliner United States from her maiden voyage in 1952 to his retirement in 1967, died of cancer on Sunday in St. Rose's Home. He was 75 years old and lived at 511 East 20th Street.

Mr. Kaiser, who was a captain in the Naval Reserve, was a native of Phoebus, Va., and worked at the nearby Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company yards until he went to sea in 1923 as an oiler on the Leviathan, then the flagship of United States Lines. In 1941 he had risen to chief engineer of the liner Manhattan, a post he kept during Navy duty in World War II, when the ship was the transport Wakefield. Returning to United States Lines in 1946, he became chief engineer of the liner America in 1948.

Surviving is his wife, the former Eleanor Breytohl.
