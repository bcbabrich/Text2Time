WEINBERG--James L.,The Jewish Museum deeply mourns the passing of James L. Weinberg, Life Trustee. Jim joined the Board in 1977 and served as Chairman from 1979-1987, overseeing extraordinary institutional growth. Under his leadership, the Museum expanded its educational outreach and presented many critically acclaimed exhibitions. He received the Mayer Sulzberger Award in 1986 and was appointed a Life Trustee in 1991. Jim's legacy at The Jewish Museum continues with the recent establishment of the James L. Weinberg Distinguished Lecture endowed by his brother Marshall M. Weinberg. His devotion to The Jewish Museum and wise counsel will be deeply missed. Our heartfelt condolences go to his brother Marshall, his children Adam and Lorraine, Jed, Nina and Bruce, and grandchildren Daniel, Zoe and Kira.
