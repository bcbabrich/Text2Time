A major witness testified yesterday that he played a part in creating a ''commission'' of Mafia leaders in Sicily after learning about a similar ruling group in the United States.

Testifying in the ''pizza connection'' narcotics trial in Manhattan, the witness, Tommaso Buscetta, said he learned about the American ''commission'' from Salvatore (Lucky) Luciano and Joseph Bonanno, who were top Mafia leaders from New York.

Mr. Buscetta, a Sicilian Mafia member who provided many colorful details about the organization, testified that he met Mr. Luciano, who was living in exile in Italy in the early 1950's. He said Mr. Luciano told him that the Mafia was the same in Sicily and America.

'Always the Same'

''The structure of the two Mafias was always the same,'' Mr. Buscetta testified in Federal District Court. ''The only change was in terms of very minor details.''
