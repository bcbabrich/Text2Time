Fred Lebow, director of the New York City Marathon, said yesterday that the field for the annual event, scheduled for Oct. 23, would be increased by 1,000, to 17,000 contestants. ''With the cooperation we have received from the City Government, the Police Department, the corporate sponsors and the people of New York City, I'm sure we'll have no problem handling the additional 1,000 runners,'' said Lebow. Last year, 60,000 entries were received.
