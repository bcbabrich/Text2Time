The Dallas Cowboys hope their new head coach, Wade Phillips, can take them further than Bill Parcells did. Although Parcells never won a playoff game in three seasons with the Cowboys, Phillips has never won a playoff game as a head coach — period.

Optimists in Dallas say that wide receiver Terrell Owens will be happy and productive while playing for the laid-back Phillips and that quarterback Tony Romo will continue to develop. Skeptics wonder if Romo is the real deal, after he followed his sizzling start with a December slump. And does Owens, who is credited with ruining the team chemistry in San Francisco and Philadelphia, ever stay happy for long?

With talented skill position players like Owens, Terry Glenn, Julius Jones and Jason Witten, the Cowboys should give Romo enough help to win consistently. Phillips is an excellent defensive coach, so that unit should be fine. The Cowboys should challenge for the division title and at least make the playoffs as a wild card.

Having won the division in five of the past six seasons, the Philadelphia Eagles look formidable again. Their season largely hinges on the play of quarterback Donovan McNabb, who is coming off major knee surgery. With a healthy McNabb, the Eagles have a shot to make the Super Bowl.

Philadelphia’s offense is balanced and explosive. Brian Westbrook, an elusive runner and reliable pass-catching threat, is almost as important to the offense as McNabb. The Eagles are developing a solid corps of young wide receivers, featuring Reggie Brown, Hank Baskett and Jason Avant. Tight end L. J. Smith remains one of McNabb’s favorite targets, and the veteran wide receiver Kevin Curtis joined the team as a free agent from St. Louis.

The defense is solid and should be bolstered by the addition of linebacker Takeo Spikes, acquired in a trade with Buffalo, and the return from injury of defensive end Jevon Kearse.

The Eagles expect to make the playoffs, and they will win the division if the Cowboys do not.

Giants Coach Tom Coughlin and quarterback Eli Manning enter the season on the hot seat.

The retirement of Tiki Barber leaves a huge void, one that the offense will try to fill collectively. Manning still has three reliable veteran pass catchers — wide receivers Plaxico Burress and Amani Toomer, and tight end Jeremy Shockey. But all three need to stay healthy for the unit to click. Brandon Jacobs and Reuben Droughns are powerful running backs, but they do not possess Barber’s big-play ability.

Even before Michael Strahan’s training camp holdout, the defense faced serious questions. Mathias Kiwanuka is making the transition to linebacker from the defensive line. Osi Umenyiora is an elite defensive end, but the Giants did not force enough turnovers and allowed too many long drives last season. The new defensive coordinator, Steve Spagnuolo, a former member of the Eagles’ staff, will probably use an aggressive approach that features more blitzing.

But unless Manning takes a major step forward, the Giants will struggle to make the playoffs.

With the young Jason Campbell starting at quarterback, the Washington Redskins are in transition. Instead of once again signing big-name free agents, the Redskins are attempting to improve from within. That will not be easy.

Washington has two offensive stars: running back Clinton Portis and wide receiver Santana Moss. But the offensive line is a concern, and Campbell’s development will be more difficult if he is under duress. This could be another long season for the Redskins.

West

At least three teams could win the division. The San Francisco 49ers could be this season’s surprise team. They have a developing young quarterback in Alex Smith, one of the league’s best running backs in Frank Gore and a young defense that should continue to improve.

Signing Nate Clements as a free agent will pay immediate dividends for the 49ers, giving them a shutdown cornerback to shadow the league’s best receivers. Brandon Moore is an emerging playmaker at linebacker, and he is one reason why San Francisco’s defense is no longer a pushover.

Offensively, the 49ers have developed chemistry. People wondered, after Smith’s rookie season, if he was worthy of being the No. 1 pick, but his steady sophomore season answered many questions. The only question about Gore is his durability, but he is capable of running inside and outside. Vernon Davis is a versatile tight end, and the 49ers hope that Darrell Jackson will be as good a receiver for them as he was with Seattle.

This is Mike Nolan’s third year as head coach, and he has the franchise headed in the right direction. It may be a year too soon for San Francisco to win the division. But if the top players stay healthy, the 49ers should reach the playoffs.

The Seattle Seahawks have won the division three consecutive times, and they still have enough talent to repeat. Running back Shaun Alexander and quarterback Matt Hasselbeck are coming off injury-plagued seasons. When they are healthy, the Seahawks are difficult to stop. Seattle will have Deion Branch for a full season, and he anchors a formidable receiving corps, which includes Bobby Engram and D. J. Hackett. Walter Jones leads an offensive line that provides superb protection.

Seattle’s linebacking threesome — Lofa Tatupu, Leroy Hill and Julian Peterson — may be the best anywhere. But the secondary could use more speed, and the pass rush has lost some of its ferociousness.

Coach Mike Holmgren is a strong game planner who has established a consistent winner in Seattle. This team is still a threat to win the division and the conference, but if the Seahawks are to reach another Super Bowl, they must do it quickly before Alexander gets much older.

The St. Louis Rams could win the division, or they could finish with a losing record. Steven Jackson has proven that he can be a productive workhorse back. Jackson opens up the passing game for quarterback Marc Bulger and his quality receiving corps of Torry Holt, Isaac Bruce and Drew Bennett.

Cornerback Tye Hill may be the best player on a suspect defense, and defensive end Leonard Little makes opposing quarterbacks nervous. But this defense does not scare opponents. Last season, the Rams had a five-game stretch during which they surrendered at least 30 points four times.

Last fall, many predicted that the Arizona Cardinals would finally enjoy a winning season. It did not happen, and it probably will not happen this year. The new coach, Ken Whisenhunt, brings his creative offensive mind from Pittsburgh, and he has talent to work with: superb wide receivers in Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald, a proven running back in Edgerrin James and a talented young quarterback in Matt Leinart. But the offensive line must prove that it can protect Leinart. Safety Adrian Wilson is one of the few bright spots on defense.

The state of Arizona will play host to the next Super Bowl, but do not look for the Cardinals to be playing in it.

North

Five of the past six Super Bowl losers have missed the playoffs the next season, but the Chicago Bears are positioned to avoid that trap.

The Bears won the National Football Conference title on the strength of defense and special teams. They hope to make a return trip to the Super Bowl with an improved offense.

The dangerous kick-return specialist Devin Hester has been converted to a wide receiver, and the rookie tight end Greg Olsen was impressive during training camp before injuring his left knee in the final preseason game. Quarterback Rex Grossman can be inconsistent — prone to turnovers one week, then hot the next. Cedric Benson, takes over as the starting running back, replacing Thomas Jones, who was traded to the Jets.

Chicago’s defense is fast and aggressive, led by middle linebacker Brian Urlacher and outside linebacker Lance Briggs. Although he is upset about his contract, Briggs will be motivated to have a big season. Defensive tackle Tommie Harris, who is returning from a serious hamstring injury, will be counted on to help against the run.

Coach Lovie Smith is a defensive guru who has the respect of his players, and his Bears are the clear favorites in the division.

Brett Favre is always the center of attention in Green Bay, and he has returned healthy and motivated. Unfortunately for Favre, his supporting cast has not been upgraded. Favre wanted the Packers to trade for wide receiver Randy Moss, but Moss landed in New England.

The defense improved as last season progressed, and it will once again be the team’s strength. A. J. Hawk anchors a strong linebacker corps that also features Nick Barnett. Defensive end Aaron Kampman is an excellent pass rusher. The Packers are likely to finish around .500 and fall short of making the playoffs.

With inexperience at quarterback, the Minnesota Vikings are looking at another rebuilding season. Tarvaris Jackson is being billed as the quarterback of the future, but if Jackson struggles, the Vikings don’t have strong alternatives.

Adrian Peterson, who was a force at the University of Oklahoma, has all the tools to be a star running back. But because the Vikings lack a veteran quarterback and a big-play wide receiver, opposing defenses will be able to focus on stopping the running game, which also includes Chester Taylor, who rushed for 1,216 yards last season.

Minnesota has a strong run defense, led by tackles Pat Williams and Kevin Williams. But the Vikings will probably miss the defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin, who left to become the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Detroit Lions’ record the past six seasons is 24-72, and it is a mystery how General Manager Matt Millen has kept his job. The second-year head coach, Rod Marinelli, has instilled more discipline and accountability.

Wide receiver Calvin Johnson, Detroit’s first-round pick, was widely regarded as the best player in the draft. Johnson and Roy Williams should give the Lions a formidable receiving combo, making quarterback Jon Kitna’s job easier. Running back Tatum Bell has looked good during training camp, but the offensive line has been a trouble spot in recent years. Kitna was under constant pressure last season, throwing 22 interceptions and fumbling 11 times.

Linebacker Ernie Sims is a budding star, but the defense has plenty of holes. Name a category, and the Lions need to improve in it. Even on days when the offense clicks, the Lions may not win because their defense will struggle to get off the field. You have probably heard this before: It looks like another long season in Detroit.

South

The New Orleans Saints are Super Bowl contenders? Believe it. As strange as it sounds, for a franchise with such a difficult history, the Saints may be the best team in the conference.

They have a versatile offense, featuring a talented Drew Brees at quarterback, a breakaway runner in Reggie Bush, a power runner in Deuce McAllister and a reliable receiver in Marques Colston.

Bush will probably be more consistent with a season under his belt. His ability to catch passes, to line up as a wide receiver and to return punts makes him difficult to defend. Coach Sean Payton plans to give Bush at least 20 touches a game, figuring at least one of those will break for a big play. Brees is an accurate passer who quickly recognizes soft spots in the defense. The Saints had the league’s top-ranked offense last season, and they should pick up where they left off.

Defense will determine if New Orleans reaches its first Super Bowl. The Saints have a solid pass rush, but they have not been adept at forcing turnovers or stopping the run. Last season, they gave up 35 points against Baltimore, 38 against Pittsburgh, 31 against Cincinnati, 31 points against Carolina and 39 in the conference championship game against the Bears.

The Carolina Panthers flopped last season and finished 8-8. This is an aging team with a stagnant roster. Steve Smith is Carolina’s top offensive threat, but the Panthers’ reliance on him has taken a toll on his body.

A lot of people are feeling the heat, particularly Coach John Fox and quarterback Jake Delhomme. The new offensive coordinator, Jeff Davidson, wants more emphasis on the running game, featuring DeShaun Foster, DeAngelo Williams and Nick Goings. But the Panthers cannot return to being an elite team unless Delhomme recaptures his form of 2003, when the Panthers were N.F.C. champs. David Carr, much-maligned in Houston, is now Delhomme’s backup.

Julius Peppers is a top pass rusher, but the entire defensive line is not what it used to be, and the secondary surrendered big plays late last season. Although Fox is regarded as one of the league’s shrewdest coaches, he may find himself coaching elsewhere if the Panthers endure another disappointing season.

That familiar scowl on Jon Gruden’s face will be seen often unless the Tampa Bay Buccaneers return to playoff form. Gruden is another coach trying to save his job, and he is counting on a new quarterback, Jeff Garcia, to contribute the same magic he had in Philadelphia. Garcia is smart and mobile, but he is also 37 and does not have the strongest arm. He will need protection, a consistent running game led by Carnell Williams and help from receiver Joey Galloway.

On defense, Derrick Brooks and Ronde Barber have aged, and the younger players have not picked up the slack.

Even with Michael Vick, the Atlanta Falcons were facing a rebuilding phase. Without Vick, their weaknesses become more obvious.

The team’s new coach, Bobby Petrino, has installed the offensive system that he ran successfully at Louisville. But Petrino needs more talent to make it work in Atlanta. Joey Harrington inherits the starting quarterback job.

Warrick Dunn is a quality running back, but he has logged a lot of miles. Alge Crumpler is a reliable target at tight end.

Defensive end John Abraham is an impact player, although he is injury prone. DeAngelo Hall is one of the league’s best cornerbacks, but there are plenty of areas where the Falcons’ defense can be attacked.
