Anyone, male or female, who has ever gone through pregnancy and childbirth will find familiar material in ''A Rooster in the Henhouse,''

The one-man 90-minute show, written by and starring John O'Hern, tells the ostensibly autobiographical story of how this actor became a stay-at-home father.

Playing through Oct. 25 at the Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, this comedy of recognition serves best as a showcase for the appealing versatility of Mr. O'Hern, who plays, among other characters, a little girl, his wife, an eccentric Irish barfly full of sex advice, a birthing coach, women in labor, a cool obstetrician, an Indian anesthesiologist, a Jamaican nurse, squeamish fathers-to-be and an infant in the process of being born.

Mr. O'Hern the actor, directed by Mark S. Graham, outdoes Mr. O'Hern the writer. The show is good-natured, with a fair share of laughs and humorous if unsurprising observations about men and women, but on its way to its high point, in the hospital during labor, it leaves the impression that the telling may take nine months. Leading up to impregnation and a natural childbirth class, audiences may learn more than they care to about the sex lives of Mr. O'Hern and the organizational genius who is his wife, Lisa. And occasionally, Mr. O'Hern's justifiable pride in his accomplishments as a father slips just across the line separating it from smug self-satisfaction.
