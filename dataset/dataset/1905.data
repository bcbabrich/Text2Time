An Ad (Underground) for a Hair Dye (Down There)

“I consider this to be in much better taste than that odious concept of turning an entire subway car into an ad by covering every possible surface, à la that ‘Mad Men’ campaign.”

Police Investigate Officer in Critical Mass Video

“All the bike paths in the world won’t do a whole lot of good if the N.Y.P.D. can’t accept the fact that pedestrians and cyclists are as important (plenty would argue MORE important) than motorists.”

Problems in MetroCard Machines Persist

“An implantable chip is the answer to all our problems. Use it to gain entry to the subway, to your office, to your apartment building. Nod your head to pay for your groceries or whatever strikes your fancy at that moment. Hooker, candybar, no problem.

Make sure you get the kind though, which is wired to create an increasingly uncomfortable sensation in your stomach as you approach the limits of your account. Is that vomit or credit?”

Restaurants Take the Tap Water Pledge

“After a weekend of restaurant dining with out-of-town guests, I was struck by how the norm is now to ask “what kind of water” we’d like. Um, the cold, wet, free kind?! I know what they’re trying to do, but it is appalling to me that it’s done with such frequency in New York, which has some of the best-tasting tap water I’ve ever had. It would be amusing to asked for tap water, but to demand ice cubes made from bottled water. (Since I’ve never been asked ‘what kind of ice cube’ I want with my water, I assume all ice is made from tap water.) Although I’m sure the amusement wouldn’t last long once an enterprising management quickly recognized this as yet another revenue stream.”

Richard Nixon’s Search for a New York Home

“Like everyone else, I’m fascinated by the story about politics, real estate and NY. But I’m surprised that no one has commented on the prices! $300K for the wonderful places in New York City in the 1970s — what a dream!”

Foreign Tourists Adore New York

“I visited New York four years ago, and was blown away by the city, and its citizens. I hope to return soon for a visit. However, I did not realise that there was a sense of ill-will towards tourists, which makes me think twice about visiting again. You have a truly great city. Be proud of it, and thank you for giving this one tourist, at least, such great pleasure. I love the place.”

Have Camera, Will Trespass, on Brooklyn Waterfront

“What sad, beautiful photographs. I applaud Nathan Kensinger as a digital historian and appreciate his bringing attention to the sad plight of our forgotten architectural heritage. It is unfortunate that these sites have so little value in our society. All their stories will soon be lost forever.”

House Tables Resolution to Censure Rangel

“My guess is that, at the end of the day, Rangel’s apartment arrangement is legal, but completely contrary to the intent behind the law. And it will probably be used as evidence that we should scrap the whole rent stabilization system – completely contrary to the interests of the people Rangel represents. Way to go, Charlie. Mostly, though, I find it ironic that Alcee Hastings was the person moving to table to censure resoluton, since he was a former federal judge removed from the bench for corruption. ”

Are Economic Woes Pushing Up Library Circulation?

“It’s been years since I’ve been able to afford even a paperback. If I ever did have enough money to do more than just get by, believe me, the library would be one of the first I’d donate to.” — Posted by Emerson
