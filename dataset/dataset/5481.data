The panel met criticism from Assemblyman Roger L. Green, Democrat of Brooklyn. Mr. Green, a leading black legislator, said he was satisfied with the racial composition of the panel, two blacks, two Hispanic people, one Asian and three whites.

But he said the panel should also reflect ''new voices,'' specifically parents of public school children.

''I would have to say I am disappointed and concerned that the panel is not reflective of the major constituencies that have a vested interest in the school system,'' said Mr. Green, who is chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. ''By that I mean all parents and black and Hispanic children.'' Black and Hispanic children make up a majority of the school population in the city.

The delay in forming the panel and Mr. Green's outspokeness seemed to be a harbinger of the politically delicate nature of the task the board faces as it gets down to the business of studying the qualifications of candidates for Chancellor. #2 Announced Candidates Mr. Wagner, who was in Baltimore yesterday, said during the last month that he had trouble finding people to serve on the panel. Two, Dr. Harold E. Howe, senior lecturer in education at Harvard, and Franklin A. Thomas, president of the Ford Foundation, initially agreed to be on the panel but then declined. Mr. Wagner said Dr. Howe had cited the press of other obligations. Mr. Wagner said Mr. Thomas needed the permission of the foundation board to go ahead.

The Board of Education is faced with two announced candidates, both of whom are black and neither of whom engender broad enthusiasm among board members. Dr. Bernard E. Gifford, dean of the Graduate School of Education at the University of California at Berkeley and a former deputy schools chancellor in New York, met, at his request, with two board members during a recent visit to the city.
