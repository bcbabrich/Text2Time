IN the 20th century, scientists at Bell Laboratories invented modern marvels like the transistor and the laser, but that is ancient history to the engineers working there today for Lucent Technologies Inc. In fact, they do not really have much use for the present.

In a windowless office at Bell Labs' headquarters in Murray Hill, N.J., Gerald Butters, chief of Lucent's optical networking group, gestures dismissively at his magazine-thin laptop computer and the network cord dangling beside it.

''Look,'' he says, ''to get onto the network today, I've got a skinny wire here and I'm limited by the speed of the modem and I'm limited by the network to something surely less than the processor speed in this computing unit.''

In the Bell Labs vision, that wire will soon disappear. For that matter, the laptop computer may disappear as well. In their place will emerge a world in which the ability to connect -- with wires or without -- to a global network at lightning speeds will become almost ubiquitous. For when you think about it, which is what Bell Labs spends billions doing, the communications revolution so far has been limited to a mere handful of devices -- the phone, the fax, the modem, the television.
