T??e high cost of housin?? res??lts from many factors. Among them are rapidly i?? creasing land values in and near the nation's cities, zoom ing labor costs owing to large wage increases won by organized workers in the construction trades, inability of producers and developers to employ modern tech no??ogy effectively, and op position by local authorities to method??hat would in crease the use of scarce land for housing.

But, in the words of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, George Romney, “as important as all these factors are, the high co??t of home financing is pushing up the cost of hous ing as much or more than anything else.”

The cost of housing, taking everything into considera tion, is rising by 8 to 10 per cent a year on the average.

“It isn't going to ??hange, because basic economic for ces at work won't let it,” said Cornelius C. Rose Jr., chair man of North American Mortgage Investors, one of the new real estate invest ment trusts that have sought in the last couple of years to channel money from in vestors into housing.

“For one thing the reces sion this year has deferred a lot of demand for housing. The money that we've seen coming into the market lately will be sopped up in no time.”

Mr. Rose was one of the more than 4,000 mortgage bankers, lenders and Govern ment officials who spent last week assessing the state of home finance across the country. Investment trusts such as his have already poured $1.6‐billion into con struction loans—most of it money that would not other wise have found its way into housing production. The trusts enable small investors, who cannot buy mortgages because of their high denom ??ations, to own shares in an entity that in turn provides mortgage money.

Life insurance companies, once a vital source of resi dential mortgage money, have largely abandoned the field for two principal rea sons. Most insurance compa nies have suffered a cash outflow in the period of ris ing interest rates of the last few years as policy holders have exercised their right to borrow at 5 per cent and 5½ per cent interest on their policies, reinvesting the bor rowed funds at higher pre vailing interest rates.
