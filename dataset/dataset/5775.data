Off scree this red-blooded American hero seems no larger than life -5-foot-10-inches and 167 pounds. But, oh, is he in shape. He said he spends three hours every morning working out with his stunt men in a gymnasium in his home in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., ''to maintain a certain youthful appearance.'' The workouts have not been in vain, judging from the impressive figure he cuts in tight blue jeans and a red plaid cowboy shirt. He has longish blond hair with a fringe of bangs flopping over his forehead, a blond mustache and a blond beard. Underneath all the hair he bears a somewhat craggy resemblance to Robert Redford.

Why does he think he's become so popular with audiences? ''Well, my films do deal with certain positive things,'' he said. ''The endings are always positive. I think a lot of people are tired of depressing, boring films. I think they like to feel good at the end of a film. One of the biggest thrills of my life came when I went to a theater to see 'Missing in Action,' and all the people stood up and applauded at the end. That's when my character brings some P.O.W.'s he's just rescued to a conference in Saigon, where the politicians are saying there aren't any more prisoners of war.''

Talk like that brings forth memories of John Wayne anbd Charles Bronson, as well as Sylvester Stallone as Rambo. Asked if he's as patriotic as the characters he has played, Mr. Norris crosses his left foot, shod in a gray ostrich-skin cowboy boot, over his right knee and replies: ''I am a conservative, a real flag waver, a big Ronald Reagan fan. I'm not so much a Republican or Democrat; I go more for the man himself. Ronald Reagan says what he thinks, he's not afraid to speak his mind, even if he may be unpopular. I want a strong leader and he is a strong leader. And ever since he has been in office there has been a more positive, patriotic feeling in this country.''

Mr. Norris said he thought there was a big difference between ''Missing in Action'' and Mr. Stallone's recent ''Rambo: First Blood Part II,'' in which Rambo also rescues some prisoners of war. ''I'm not quite as anti-Government as Rambo is,'' he said. ''When the helicopter comes to rescue Rambo and the American M.I.A., and then leaves them stranded, I found that unrealistic. There is not an American pilot alive who would leave them there. They'd have to shoot me to stop me from picking them up, because I'd be dead inside if I didn't.''

He added that he had made ''Missing in Action'' and its sequel, ''Missing in Action 2: The Beginning,'' as a tribute to his younger brother, Wieland, who died in Vietnam in 1970 while leading a squad of soldiers on patrol in the jungle. ''Vietnam was a tragic mistake,'' he said. ''If you don't want to win the battle, don't get involved.''

Mr. Norris, born Carlos Ray Norris, said he grew up under the influence of the movies of John Wayne, whom he regarded as his ''substitute father'' after his own Cherokee father, an alcoholic, left the family's home in Ryan, Okla., when he was 10. His Irish-English mother later moved the family of three boys to Torrance, Calif.
