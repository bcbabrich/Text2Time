Prices of Treasury securities moved higher for the second straight session yesterday, as bargain-hunters bought securities that had been battered over the last six weeks. Gains of as much as a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, were recorded.

Buying was helped by speculation that President Bush would announce additional cuts in American military personnel in Europe - which he did in his State of the Union address last night - and by economic reports during the day that were weaker than anticipated.

Yesterday afternoon the Treasury also announced the size of next week's refunding auctions. It said it would sell a total of $30 billion worth of securities, with auctions of $10 billion each of new 3-year notes on Tuesday, new 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday.

Signs of Weak Conditions

Some market participants said yesterday that reports that sales of new homes fell by more than 9 percent in December and a survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago area showed that economic conditions remain weak. A weak economy, they reasoned, would discourage the Federal Reserve from tightening credit by raising interest rates. It might even lower rates to spur the economy, thus making current rates relatively attractive.
