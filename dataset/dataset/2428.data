A three-year-old federal law that provided a backstop to insurance companies in the event of a terrorist attack should not be extended in its current form, Bush administration officials said yesterday.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was approved in the wake of the attacks of 2001, when many insurers stopped providing terrorism coverage or made it extremely costly. Scheduled to expire at the end of this year, it requires the federal government to cover 90 percent of combined damages in excess of $15 billion and up to $100 billion.

In a letter delivered yesterday to Congressional leaders, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said the law had achieved its "temporary objectives" of stabilizing the private insurance market during a period of economic uncertainty. Now that the economy has improved, Mr. Snow said, the administration will not support a backstop unless the insurance industry is willing to shoulder more of the risk.

In an assessment of the law, also released yesterday, the Treasury acknowledged that eliminating the backstop was likely to result in "less terrorism insurance written by insurers, higher prices and lower policyholder take-up." But in time, it said, the industry could increase its capacity to insure terrorism risk.
