With an eye toward the convergence of the Internet and next-generation digital cellular networks, Motorola plans to announce a new chip design on Monday that is meant to support a wide range of cellular telephone standards while offering more computer-like features.

The new chip family is part of Motorola's effort to move its chip production beyond supplying the company's own cell-phone business and toward competing directly in the cellular market with chip makers like Texas Instruments, Royal Philips Electronics and Qualcomm.

''We've been extremely quiet; now we want people to know we're open for business,'' said Mario Rivas, the general manager of Motorola's wireless subscriber systems group.

This year, 225 million cellular telephones will be sold worldwide, accounting for the sale of $10.7 billion worth of semiconductors, according to researchers at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif.
