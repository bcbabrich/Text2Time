Stocks seesawed yesterday in quiet trading amid new signs that a recession could be on the way.

By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 5.69, to 2,442.33.

Many investors turned to utilities as a recessionary hedge as bond prices rose sharply and interest rates dropped, and the Dow utilities index climbed 2.33, or more than 1 percent, to 213.28.

With bargain hunters still active, the Dow industrial average had climbed 14 points early in the day, but before noon it began dropping in the wake of discouraging economic news.

The Chicago Purchasing Management index, used as a business barometer of the Middle West, tumbled to 46.8 percent in October from a strong 50.3 percent the previous month.
