Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential primary campaign said today that it had raised $26 million during the first quarter, more than three times as much as the previous record for this stage of a Democratic primary.

The announcement, made in a conference call with reporters this afternoon just 14 hours after the end of the first quarter, is the latest indication that spending on this year’s presidential race is on track to far surpass any previous election, with the leading candidates raising as much as $100 million each before January 1 of the election year.

For the first time since the advent of the presidential public campaign financing system after Watergate, the top candidates are expected to turn down public money in favor of raising as much as they can from private donors without any limit.

The Clinton campaign statement is also the opening of a complicated poker game in which the campaigns will strategize about when and how to disclose details of their fundraising efforts in order to publicize their strengths and downplay their weaknesses. First quarter campaign fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission are not due until April 15, so any information provided before then is voluntary.

Some other Democratic primary campaigns said they had brought in much less in contributions. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson raised more than $6 million in the first quarter, according to his campaign. Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, another Democratic primary candidate, said in an interview on Fox News Sunday that he expected to raise about $3 million in the first quarter. Bill Burton, a spokesman for Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton’s principal rival said he would not disclose any numbers.

In an example of the art of disclosing fundraising figures, Senator Clinton’s campaign declined to disclose how much of the $26 million had been raised for the Democratic primary campaign account and how much for ithe general election, a detail which could reveal how dependent her campaign is on a relatively small number of big donors.

Under campaign finance laws, a donor can contribute up to $2300 to a primary campaign and, if they chose, up to an additional $2300 for the general election. Since campaigns can roll leftover money from their primary campaign account to the general election account, campaigns only direct contributions exceeding $2300 into their general election coffers.

Thus, disclosing how much Mrs. Clinton’s campaign had raised for the general election would indicate how much of her money was raised from donors who contributions had exceeded $2300.

Senator John Edwards was expected to release his results early this evening. Mr. Edwards holds the previous record for fundraising in the first quarter of a Democratic primary by a candidate outside the White House, having raised $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 before in his previous bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Former Vice President Al Gore raised $9 million in the first quarter of 1999.

The disclosures this afternoon illustrated what is likely to be a wide gulf between the top candidates and dark horses in the early fundraising. It remains to be seen how decisive that may be in an election without spending limits in either the primary or general election.

Among Republicans, a spokesman for Senator John McCain of Arizona said his campaign was not yet willing to disclose its fundraising totals. Spokesmen for former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York had not yet responded to calls by this afternoon.

Among the potential dark horse candidates, the campaign of Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado has said it raised about $1.3 million.

In the logic of campaign publicity, campaigns are likely to consider it advantageous to announce numbers at the same time as Senator Clinton if they want their relatively low numbers to be overshadowed in the news coverage. Conversely, waiting suggest they may want to attract attention to unexpectedly strong results.
