There were exasperating moments when the whip-quick Michael Dickerson left Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy slinging his fist into the scorer's table.

As each arching jumper by the Grizzlies' phenom splashed into the net, the threat of embarrassment for the Knicks increased and the potential for a road-trip collapse loomed greater. But these were the Grizzlies. They created their own undoing tonight. After Dickerson helped the Grizzlies pull within 1 point with two minutes left, a turnover and a technical foul opened the way for Patrick Ewing to end the tension.

He was not a factor for most of the night, but Ewing hit two free throws and a runner in the closing 1 minute 3 seconds to put the Knicks in position for an 89-83 sigh of relief at General Motors Place. Instead of having their trip ruined, the Knicks improved to 3-1 on their West Coast swing, ensuring them of a winning trip with the Lakers left to play. Instead of having their spirits crushed, the Knicks (45-27) are within a half-game of the Miami Heat at the top of the Atlantic Division.

The Knicks were led by Latrell Sprewell's 23 points and 24 from Allan Houston. Marcus Camby added 18 off the bench, and Ewing finished with 11 points. With the Knicks' frontcourt struggling, the Grizzlies had a chance. Dickerson, who scored 28 points, gave them that chance. The Knicks led by 9 points early in the fourth quarter, but a 13-point binge by Dickerson pulled the game tighter. Dickerson sent the Grizzlies on an 8-2 run to cut the Knicks' lead to 73-70 with 6:59 left in the game.
