PARIS — On Wednesday, Virgil Abloh, the rising street wear designer and creative director for Kanye West, staged the first presentation for his Off-White line in a gallery in the Marais. It was an extended meditation on the white T-shirt and jeans — jeans made both in his Italian factories and by collaboration with Levi’s, white T-shirts split and reworked, inserted with shoulder pads, pleated and Frankensteined together. Mr. Abloh, a gregarious and enthusiastic designer, was in a chatty mood backstage. Here, five things to know about his collection, in his own words.

He is here to revitalize the jaded.

“The whole show was based around this premise, this writing on the wall: ‘Why are you here?’ It’s my synopsis of fashion week. After the first show, you go out to dinner and say, ‘What did you see?’ Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, nothing.’ ‘What’s really great?’ ‘Oh, nothing.’ That’s why I started designing. It’s up to us to design something that’s good for people to look at. We can’t just complain.”

But he’s not doing it on his own.

“Everyone’s always like, ‘Don’t do a show when you start.’ Shows are boring. I feel like doing it small, repeating it, trying to make it a different type of experience — it’s more like performance art. I flew out my friends from New York, and we just sat at dinner and thought of it, over wine. I feel like I’m just representing a group of kids rather than being a designer who’s totalitarian. It feels rewarding. I feel like I’m just a vessel for the young fashion kid, getting into culture.”
