There will be many more than 500 winners in Tuesday’s midterm elections, but in nearly every race, there will be one significant loser: Wall Street.

There is almost no outcome in the voting booths that will help banks or the economy get out of their morass. The only meaningful result will be the inauguration of months more of uncertainty as major business issues remain unresolved including taxes, health care, regulatory reform and interest rates.

H. Hiter Harris III, the co-founder of Harris Williams & Company, an investment bank that advises midsize companies on mergers, says it’s difficult for Wall Street banks to know what they’re doing right now.

“The rules can be favorable or unfavorable; if unfavorable, it just means [the banks] have to adapt and change their state of play for the new rules,” Mr. Harris said. “When they don’t have the visibility and there’s uncertainty, they can’t do it. It’s hard for them to invest when they don’t even know what the rules are.”

This curse of uncertainty could be called a reckoning visited upon Wall Street for its inability to figure out how Washington works. Despite feisty rhetoric about Washington’s anti-business stance — let’s come out and call it smack talk — from big-name bankers like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Wall Street has largely withdrawn, thrown up its hands and given up on political engagement in the run-up to the midterm elections.

There are Wall Street mavens who were attracted to President Obama for his intelligence and charisma who say they now feel stung by the president’s use of terms like “fat cats” and his frequent rhetorical pairings of business with greed.

Since the Dodd-Frank Act passed to overhaul the regulation of Wall Street, the biggest financial players have been sulking by cutting down on donations or withdrawing from the political game altogether. Three Wall Street giants – JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley – all announced in recent months that they would not make direct campaign contributions to politicians. (Individual bankers at those firms are free to donate.)

Indeed, Wall Street has taken a surprisingly haughty, cloistered approach to Washington, a town that thrives on a good face-to-face schmooze. While banks are usually generous financial contributors, the impression they give is that they’re giving money while holding their noses.

Tony Fratto, a former Treasury official in the Bush administration and currently managing director of the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington, says Wall Street bankers have no one to blame but themselves. “They have disdain for politics, they have disdain for this town,” Mr. Fratto said. “I understand that, but this town isn’t going away, and you can decide to either play or not play. And they mostly decide to not play and then complain about it.”

There’s little personal contact between the two camps; Wall Street generally throws a lot of money into politics, but it does so impersonally, through industry groups or political action committees.

Few bankers – even the most important ones – bother to spend quality time with politicians to explain issues. Instead, the Street prefers to work through lobbyists.

If a big-name bank C.E.O. visits Washington these days, he’s more likely than not to be testifying in front of a hostile panel about the financial crisis. When the president called Wall Street executives down to Washington last year, several begged off.

There are those, however, who would call just desserts for Wall Street for getting the political process wrong. Giant banks that do business in dozens of countries all over the world, and have staff coast to coast, are surprisingly provincial in their political habits.Wall Street doesn’t analyze Congressional districts as it does companies.

Finance donations are more likely to go where they have the most impact: the heads of major financial committees and New York’s senators and members of the House. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, recently excited some controversy when The Boston Herald reported that he had received about $40,000 toward his re-election campaign from banks, finance-industry groups and other beneficiaries of the TARP loan program.

According to OpenSecrets.org, Mr. Frank’s ability to raise money has increased 118 percent since 2004, before he was tapped to join the financial services committee. His coffers grew by 37 percent the year he was tapped to become chairman of the committee.

Even so, despite populist rage, Wall Street money has never been as rich a source of money for politicians as it would appear. Mr. Frank, for instance, just put in $200,000 of his own money into his campaign – a considerable investment considering that his recorded net worth is around $500,000.

Morgan Stanley, one of the top contributors, has given only $20 million to politicians since 1989 – an average of just over $1 million a year, a pittance compared with the firm’s revenue of $6.8 billion in the most recent quarter.

If Wall Street has retreated in disgust from the political arena, it may be because it’s time to regroup.

“These elections won’t be a palace coup.,” Mr. Fratto said. “The best Wall Street can hope for is that the treadmill just stops. They don’t have much hope that there will be reverses in financial regulatory reform. They just don’t want anything new coming at them.”
