''I'm not a nurse,'' I respond automatically, pointing out to him a group of nurses.

As he went in search of his wife's nurse, I reflected not for the first time that male medical students (and interns) never get mistaken for nurses, never get asked for bedpans, or dinner trays, or baths. In fact, male nurses sometimes get mistaken for doctors. But a woman in a white coat with a stethoscope around her neck is frequently taken for a nurse.

This can at times be very irritating to those who are insecure about their own status, and as a medical student I was certainly a bit insecure about mine. After all, the medical student's role in the hospital is a little unclear, especially from the patient's point of view. Doctors often introduce medical students as ''student doctors,'' or just as ''doctors'' - this is contrary to all rules of proper behavior, but is done all the time, on the pretext that patients feel more comfortable if they think they are being examined by doctors, no matter how obviously inexperienced. So medical students may feel like frauds.

From their position at the bottom of the pyramid they are keenly aware of their own lack of knowledge, afraid of having their ignorance shown up. So being mistaken for a nurse threatens some pretty shaky egos. The female medical student may even convince herself that by vehemently correcting this mistake, she is striking a blow for women in medicine, and of course in some sense she is: Why, when you see a woman in white, do you assume she's a nurse?

Still, nurse or not, why didn't I just get up and get the patient a bedpan if that's what she needed? On the one hand, of course, I was tired - but it wouldn't have taken much time or effort. I suppose it was something that had happened to me during my time in the hospital. At the very beginning of the clerkship, I would have been only too happy to be asked to do something within my capabilities. But now, after a couple of months in the hospital, in some rather mysterious way I had absorbed the various rules and regulations that prescribe what is and what is not doctor's work.

I thought back to a story my friend told me early in the rotation. She had helped a patient with his urinal (hospital term for a plastic bottle used by bed-bound male patients) and had been told by two of our (male) fellow students that they would never do such a thing. ''I would tell the patient to ring for the nurse.''
