To the Editor:

Re "The Making of a Tragedy" by Thomas Fleming (Op-Ed, July 19): The Allies had many good reasons for not paying much attention to the German military's tardy resistance to Hitler, but the underlying reason showed that the lessons of history can sometimes be properly applied.

In 1918 the German generals were allowed to deal for peace, the Kaiser was put on a train to the Netherlands in his pajamas, and the Fatherland was left physically untouched. The resulting "stab in the back" myth and the glorification of the invincible German "front soldier" laid the foundations of World War II.

The Allies were determined not to create a similar situation in 1944, insisting instead on total, unconditional surrender. The message was to be unmistakable: You Germans are not invincible and have no one to blame for your destruction but your own leaders. Mr. Fleming writes that "unconditional surrender was a propaganda windfall for the Nazis."

On the contrary, this strategy won the peace. The West Germans became a nation of pacifists and did not look back fondly to those "fighting" days in occupied Poland. What they saw was simply too horrible. The Holocaust? Until 30 years after the war, the murder of the Jews was hardly an issue in Germany.
