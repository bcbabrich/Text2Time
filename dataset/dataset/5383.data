Even before ABC's mini-series ''Amerika'' had begun production, powerful foes were trying to keep it off the air. In 1985, the Kremlin warned ABC's Moscow bureau of possible reprisals if the show ran.

Earlier this year, United Nations officials criticized the seven-part series, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 15, for portraying corrupt international peacekeeping forces joining the K.G.B. in a takeover of the United States. A number of religious and disarmament organizations have also opposed the series, while Reed Irvine of the conservative group Accuracy in Media complained it made the Soviet occupiers seem too nice.

Perhaps the biggest blow came last week when the Chrysler Corporation decided that its commercials, keyed to the theme ''The Pride is Back - Born in America,'' were inappropriate for a series about Soviet conquest. After viewing six hours of it, Chrysler's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, decided to cancel about $7 million worth of commercials.

Chrysler was the largest sponsor, but ABC officials vowed that the show would go on. Meanwhile, the Soviets, who have denounced ''Amerika'' as ''psychological warfare,'' are offering to buy it for Soviet television, apparently as an example of American propaganda.
