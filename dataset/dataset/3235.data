Earnings at Banco Bradesco S.A., a large Brazilian bank, rose 5.5 percent, to 365 million reais, or $202 million, in the fourth quarter, and were up 9 percent for the year, to 1.1 billion reais, or $625 million. Still, the results were far below the 22 percent gain in 1998, reflecting Brazil's sharp currency devaluation last year. Simon Romero
