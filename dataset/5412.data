This danger is intensified by the overhang of billions of dollars of debt owed by third world countries to Western banks, and the fear that there is no ''lender of last resort'' capable of rescuing the debtors from default, if their ability to export and service their debts were to be wrecked by a steep slump in the industrial world.

Nevertheless, the world economy and financial system has been kept afloat by the willingness of the United States to play the role of what George Soros, president of the Quantum Fund, calls the ''borrower of last resort.'' By running both a huge budget and trade deficit, the United States has provided a haven for both foreign goods and foreign capital. This has been sustained by what Mr. Soros, in a forthcoming book called ''The Alchemy of Finance,'' refers to as President Reagan's ''Imperial Circle,'' with the budget deficit, tax cuts and rising military expenditures driving the economy, and an overvalued dollar, high interest rates and the trade deficit sucking in the foreign capital needed to finance American public and private debts, which now exceed $9 trillion.

The question is how long this can go on and whether recent events foreshadow its approaching end. Mr. Soros draws up two scenarios. The first, relatively optimistic, is that the dollar declines gradually, bringing relief to American exports and import-competitive industries. Inflation picks up a little, but the economy recovers, and the lower dollar makes a safe landing. The prospects of this happening, Mr. Soros says, are better than at any time since the inception of Mr. Reagan's Imperial Circle because the authorities in the major industrial countries have recognized the need to bring the imbalances under control. It is conceivable, he finds, that currencies may settle down into a more stable rate pattern as the world monetary system passes from free floating or dirty floating to managed floating.

The alternative is what Mr. Soros calls a ''disaster scenario.''

The tradeable goods sector remains under pressure in the United States and elsewhere. The weakness spreads to other sectors. The Federal Reserve, to prevent recession and a blow to the banking system, pumps out money, but much of the stimulation leaks out in the form of imports. Eventually, foreigners are loath to hold dollars, long-term interest rates climb, the dollar falls precipitously and inflation worsens, even as the economy slides into a full-fledged recession. * * *

Which scenario is more likely? The shocks of the past few days suggest that the disaster scenario is all too credible. But the response of governments in avoiding a showdown on protectionism and in providing cushions for the falling dollar suggest that the more hopeful scenario is still possible.
