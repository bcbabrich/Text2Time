o the Editor:

''Guns in the House'' (editorial, May 27) suggests that Congress mandate ''smart gun'' technology to deter teen-agers from obtaining firearms. But if Congress wants to get serious about keeping guns away from teen-agers and criminals, it must pass comprehensive legislation that would supervise the manufacture, distribution and sale of guns.

What works for cars can work for guns. Without registration and licensing of cars and drivers, authorized dealerships, manufacturing and design specifications, and owner's liability insurance, door locks alone would not deter under-age or criminal use of automobiles. One-car-a-month isn't an issue for most Americans because of the costs involved with owning a car. Congress must regulate the gun industry to keep children or criminals away from guns.
