To the Editor:

I found ''My Life, My Hummer'' (Escapes, Sept. 26) fascinating and terrifying. Karin Strickland wonders, seemingly without guile, why pesky do-gooders might resent her passion for driving an H2. How about this: this beast, as she lovingly calls it, not only pollutes the air and wastes fuel (fostering our dependence on foreign oil), but also turns the old-fashioned highway fender-bender into a deadly catastrophe.

She says, ''If I don't have the freedom to decide what's good for me, then maybe we have the wrong country right now.'' I say that with rights come responsibilities. Has she no notion of the concept of doing no harm to her fellow Americans?

I pray that she isn't fond of talking on a cellphone while driving her beast on cross-country pleasure trips.
