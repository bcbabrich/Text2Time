Bonds called for redemption January prior to maturity declined to a nine‐month low of $71,788,000, a survey by The New York Times disclosed yesterday.

This compares witn bond redemptions valued at $203,442,000 in December, nearly a threefold decline.

In January, 203 bond issues were called for redemption against 198 calls in December.

No comparisons with the corresponding month of 1963 were available due to the 114‐day newspaper strike then in progress.

The 131 state and municipal bond issues called for redemption in January totaled $27,211,000, down from 122 bond issues worth $99,001,000 in the preceding month,
