With the Chicago area deprived of baseball, golf was the only wheel in town today, and a record crowd of 26,200 turned out for the first round of the 78th Western Open at the Butler National Golf Club.

Don Pooley, winner of one tournament in his six years on the tour, led the opening round by a stroke with a 68, four under par. Bill Rogers, Jim Simons, Greg Powers and Joe Inman shared second place on 69's.

The course is one of the more difficult venues of the tournament circuit, and a light wind made conditions tougher. Rogers and Powers were not boasting, but expressing the consensus, when they said that any subpar round here was a good one.

Lee Trevino scored 71, where he was tied with seven others. Hale Irwin, a former winner of this event, was in a group including George Burns and Tom Kite, tied at 72.
