Aside from financial considerations (budget talk is in the neighborhood of $350,000), London was chosen because Mr. Pinter is there, Mr. Brown said. The plan is to play Brighton and Bath before moving to London. Then, ''if all goes well, New York.'' O'Toole for New York

Back to the present: Mr. Redington is the producer of ''Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell,'' the sleeper-hit of the London season. The Keith Waterhouse comedy-drama is based on the life of a British journalist who, when he isn't drunk (''unwell''), writes the ''Low Life'' column for The Spectator, and it stars Peter O'Toole. The play, directed by Ned Sherrin, begins with Mr. O'Toole unwinding himself from under a table in a London pub where he has been accidentally locked in for the night. While awaiting rescue or morning, he drinks, chain-smokes and reviews his life.

The production opened in mid-October and soon scores of eager theatergoers were lined up before each performance, hoping for returned or unclaimed tickets. Mr. O'Toole has commited himself to a 26-week run and after that there's a possibility of a short season in Australia. Then, at some point, depending on a number of things, not the least of which is the star's timetable, ''we'd love it to happen in New York,'' Mr. Redington said. Small 'Othello'

There's no chance of New Yorkers seeing what proved to be another of the most in-demand shows in London this fall. But there is hope that the televised version, which is being filmed, will make it over here in the not-too-distant future. It's the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Othello,'' which was directed by Trevor Nunn and which starred Ian McKellen and Willard White. The 6-week Stratford run and the 11-week London run (at the Young Vic) brought to fruition Mr. Nunn's dream of returning to a small-scale production similar to the 1979 ''Macbeth'' that starred Mr. McKellen and Judi Dench.

''It was an opportunity to examine the show on a different scale,'' said a Shakespeare Company spokesman. Lahti Did It Her Way
