In the end, the burdens were more than the Buffalo Bills could bear.

There was the weight of failure in the previous two Super Bowls and the weight of expectations for Super Bowl XXVII yesterday. And if that wasn't enough, the Dallas Cowboys quickly brought their own pressure to bear, forcing nine Buffalo turnovers as they humiliated the Bills, 52-17.

The Bills, whose turnovers set a Super Bowl record, were left to make history as the first team to lose three consecutive Super Bowls.

Jim Kelly, the Buffalo quarterback, had two passes intercepted before he was forced out of the game in the second quarter. That brought on Frank Reich, architect of the greatest comeback in college football history and, recently, pro football's greatest -- a playoff victory over Houston in which the Bills rallied from 32 points down.

But yesterday in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., it was not to be. Troy Aikman's four touchdown passes revived the glory of the Dallas Cowboys, a team that had not been to the Super Bowl in 14 years. Presiding over it all was Jimmy Johnson, who in his fourth year as the Cowboys' coach became the only man to lead a college team, the University of Miami, to a national championship and a pro football team to a Super Bowl victory.
