Over the last couple of days, two N.H.L. figures — Krys Barch, an active journeyman, and Wayne Gretzky, the best player of all time — have made what at first blush seem like disturbing references to guns, but on deeper inspection turn out to be fascinating glimpses into how long the players can hold out in the current lockout.

And the odd thing is, it is Barch who makes the more vivid case.

On Monday, Gretzky, after speaking at a Toronto seminar on personal investment, told The National Post he would have “shot myself” during his playing career if he had to miss a year because of a lockout. Alarming, perhaps for a moment, but it comes into perspective when he explains further.

“There’s no way I could have taken a year off because there is no way I would have known what to do in the middle of my career taking a year off,” Gretzky said. “That was my life.”



Gretzky lived through one brief players’ strike and one owners’ lockout that cost half a season, so he knows of what he speaks. (And he still has the common touch, as Dave Bidini shows in an account of meeting the Great One in New York last month.)

But while he merely said it would have been difficult to sit out a year, former players who experienced the 2004-5 full-season lockout, like Mike Modano, Bill Guerin and Dave Andreychuk, have said missing a year simply was not worth it.

“It’s money you feel you never get back,” Modano told ESPN last month. “Everybody thought: ‘Let’s not let each other down. Let’s do it for the future of the game. Blah, blah, blah.’ You’re only in the game so long.”

Not exactly a to-the-barricades pro-union view. The same for Guerin, who said last year of the 2004-5 lockout that “burning a year was ridiculous” and that the N.B.A. players, like the N.H.L. players, are in an owners’ league “and you are going to play when they want.”

Andreychuk advised the locked-out N.B.A. players last year to settle quickly because “if players think it’s better to sit out the season, let me tell them, it’s not – it’s just not.”

On Saturday night, Barch, a fourth-line enforcer who signed last summer with the Devils, put out on his Twitter account what amounted to a soul-baring 625-word cri de coeur about the lockout in which he confessed to have been drinking eight Old Vienna beers and a bottle of port while listening to Neil Young.

“Sometimes wondering if I should have existed when a word and a gun solidified and solved all problems,” he wrote.

But the rest of Barch’s essay (ably translated into regular paragraphs by USA Today) makes a deeper point. He speaks as a five-and-a-half-year N.H.L. veteran on a $700,000 salary who makes his living “through sweating, bleeding, cut Achilles’, broken hands, concussions, broken orbital bones, eight teeth knocked out, etc.” He’s got two kids and a third on the way, wondering what he’s going to do “to get our family ahead.”

It sounds as if he is going to explain why he wants his union to accept a quick settlement, but no.

“I wonder if the owners of Boston, New York, Washington, etc. etc. have endured any of the injuries that I or any other player in the N.H.L. have endured,” Barch wrote. “Still they probably sit there smoking the same brand of cigar, sipping the same cognac, and going on vacation to one of the five houses they own while we sit here knowing they want to take 20 percent of our paychecks.”

Then Barch tackles the revenue-sharing proposal rejected by the league:

“If the N.H.L. wants to keep teams in the South in struggling markets, then the players, along with the financially well-to-do teams, need to start working together. Or they need to start to move teams to the North where they will make money.”

Finally, Barch sums up with as eloquent an old-fashioned call for union solidarity as anyone could muster.

“The system allows the owners to continually take money from the players, contract after contract, where eventually over 40-some years, the owners will have 80 percent of the revenue,” he wrote. “The only way to stop the work stoppages long into the future is to fix the root cause of the problems. … Let the league and the players come together to fix the mistakes that have been made and make sure none are made in the future.”

Perhaps when this lockout is over, Barch will be as bitter about his experience with trade unionism as Modano, Guerin and Andreychuk are now. Or perhaps he will have Gretzky’s take, that sitting around idle would make him stir-crazy.

But right now at least, Barch is the pro-union bard of the 2012 N.H.L. lockout.
