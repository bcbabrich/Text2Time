Dr. Gary Allan Polis, a zoologist, an ecologist and one of the world's foremost experts on the dreaded scorpion, drowned on Monday in a boat accident off Mexico in the Sea of Cortez. He was 53 and lived in Davis, Calif.

Dr. Polis was one of four researchers who died when their 22-foot boat sank. His body was recovered on Thursday. Four other people on the boat swam to safety on a nearby island, and one remained missing as of yesterday.

The group, led by Dr. Polis, was on a routine expedition financed by the Earthwatch Institute to study lizards, spiders and other predators on the sea's islands. Earthwatch described the area as an ecologist's ''heaven here on earth'' for the diversity and abundance of species there.

At his death, Dr. Polis was a professor of ecology at the University of California at Davis and the chairman of the department of environmental science and policy. His research took him to the Sea of Cortez at least twice a year, the university said.
