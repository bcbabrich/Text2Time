Apologize — if it makes you feel better. But it’s not necessary.

That’s the gist of Representative Charles B. Rangel’s advice to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for her vote in 2002 to authorize an invasion of Iraq.

Mr. Rangel, who supports Senator Clinton’s bid for president, made the remarks in a taped interview for “The New York Times Close Up” program on NY1 News.

Asked by Sam Roberts of The Times if the senator should simply apologize for her vote (he referred to this article in the magazine), as former Senator John Edwards did, Mr. Rangel replied: “Why? ‘Why’ is the question I would ask and then, as soon as I answer, I say, ‘Why not?’ ” But he also said it was “ridiculous” to expect someone to apologize for “a bad vote based on the wrong information.”

He added that he had voted against authorizing the war but he still lost sleep at the time, wondering, “Suppose Bush is right?”

Getting back to the original question, Mr. Rangel concluded: “If it was me, if it makes you feel better, then apologize, but I don’t see where the apology was necessary. It was bad information and I made a bad vote based on that bad information. … For political reasons I wish she’d apologize and get on with it.”

(The interview, taped on Thursday, will be shown on NY1 at 10 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. Sunday.)

In an interview the same day on CNN, Mr. Rangel was a bit more forceful, telling Wolf Blitzer: “I can’t see for the life of me, if we had the opportunity to elect a qualified superior candidate, assuming people felt that way, what the devil would an apology have to do with anything? I don’t see how an apology can help us to get out any sooner.”

Mrs. Clinton’s advisers said today that an apology was not under consideration, and that the issue has not come up anew within the campaign.
