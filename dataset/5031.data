Buchanan led all scorers with 18 points in the 80th meeting between the two schools.

"It's an old rivalry, so maybe they came out a little bit nervous," Buchanan said. "Our defensive pressure may have forced them into some things, but I think it was mostly they were just missing their shots."

The Purple Eagles (1-2) quickly shot themselves out of the game.

Sure, the Redmen used two of their eight first-half steals to set up their first two baskets. And yes, they were able to work the transition game to add a few more layups off the break, taking a 12-2 lead six minutes in.

But the real problem was poor shooting by Niagara, which didn't hit a shot from further than 12 feet in the first half. After a frosty 5-for-28 performance from the field in the first half, Niagara trailed by 34-14 at halftime. S. Carolina 76, N. Carolina 74

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Glover scored on a layup with eight seconds left and South Carolina celebrated the one-night renewal of an old rivalry with an upset of North Carolina in the Tournament of Champions.

George Lynch's follow shot with 1:54 left gave the Tar Heels a 72-68 lead. Joe Rhett then hit the front end of a two-shot foul with 1:07 left, but when he missed the second, the Gamecocks (3-1) got the rebound and Barry Manning hit a 3-pointer with 49 seconds left to tie the score, 72-72.
