To the Editor:

I must quarrel with your March 19 report on Slovak separatism as inadequate to explain the hostility to be found in Slovak Bratislava toward Czech Prague. Although you cite a plethora of ethnographic figures to demonstrate the complicated admixture of the populations, you entirely neglect the central fact of the Slovak separatist movement.

You fail to mention the brief period of independent statehood presided over by the Rev. Josef Tiso under the domination of Hitler, following his post-Munich invasion of Czechoslovakia on March 14, 1939. You ignore Slovakia's wartime collaboration with Hitler. After liberation by the Red Army, wartime collaborators were tried and executed.

Under the tenure of Gustav Husak, a Slovak Communist, as Prime Minister at Prague from 1968, the province received an influx of developmental capital, creating polluting works for making steel, aluminum and chemicals, which, along with a gigantic munitions works, became unprofitable at the end of the cold war. Slovak unemployment rose in the lagging economy, and the separatists blamed the central government.

Last July, the separatists memorialized Father Tiso, placing a plaque in a church of a small mining town, which was blessed by the Roman Catholic bishop of Nitra. The outcry caused the Federal Parliament to set up an investigating commission to examine the history of the separatists, after which the town council ordered the plaque destroyed. Recently, President Vaclav Havel encountered hostility and derision in Bratislava on his investigative trip.
