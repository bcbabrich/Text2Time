Mitsubishi

Introduced on Thursday: 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport

What is it? Measuring 15 inches shorter than the Outlander S.U.V., the Outlander Sport is an appeal to members of Generation Y who dream of racing, but need a more practical vehicle. Mitsubishi calls it an entry-level compact crossover.

Is it real? Mitsubishi is betting on it. Shinichi Kurihara, the company’s president and chief executive, said Mitsubishi was counting on the Sport to “become our volume leader” and “outpace sales of all Outlanders combined.”

What they said: “It’s a content rich” vehicle, said Mr. Kurihara, whose “goal is to raise consumer opinion and consideration of our brand.” Rated for 31 miles per gallon on the highway, the Outlander Sport is also an attempt to pull in green-conscious drivers. The car uses regenerative braking, something usually reserved for hybrids to keep the battery charged. Mitsubishi said the regenerative system gives the alternator a break, which in turn helps improve the engine’s fuel efficiency. The company also repeatedly mentioned the vehicle’s 0.33 drag coefficient compared with the competition (better than the Hyundai Tuscon’s 0.37 and Subaru Forester’s 0.38, for example) and its relatively low curb weight (just over 3,000 pounds). In the United States, two trims will be offered. The basic ES will come with a standard 5-speed manual transmission. The premium SE model will boast a 6-speed continuously variable transmission (with six fixed ratios) with magnesium-alloy paddle shifters and an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive option.

What they didn’t say: It’s probably not going to appeal to the “reduce, reuse, recycle” crowd. There’s not enough green to go around here, and the company didn’t say how much the regenerative braking improves efficiency, for example. The company declined to discuss plans for a hybrid version, although Mitsubishi’s product strategy manager, Bryan Arnett, said the company continued to study hybrids. And Mr. Kurihara mentioned that the sport was the first of three new vehicle introductions planned for the next three years. Could one of those be a hybrid? In the meantime, the company is tricking it out for the Mitsubishi Lancer and Evolution crowd. To wit: a premium package option includes a glass roof with LED mood lighting and deafening nine-speaker, 710-watt Rockford Fosgate sound system.

What makes it tick? A 148-horsepower, 4-cylinder, 2-liter engine (compared with the 1.8-liter model for Europe). The SE version comes with the 6-speed paddle shifters, which is what most Mitsubishi buyers will want.

How much? How soon? Pricing was never mentioned. “Very affordable” was all Mr. Arnett would say, although he said cars should arrive in North American showrooms in November.

How’s it look? Decked out in a shade the company calls Laguna blue, the Sport looks as if all Mitsubishi did was put the full Outlander in a shrinking machine. The edgy headlights are there with the open-mouthed grille and the optional mood lighting should keep fans happy.
