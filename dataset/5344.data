The Houston Astros' general manager, Bill Wood, said yesterday that five candidates are being considered to replace Hal Lanier, who was dismissed as manager at the end of the season, and the latest prospect appears to be a former Yankee coach. ''For all practical purposes, I've completed the interviewing process,'' Wood said. Lou Piniella, the Yankees' former manager; Art Howe, the Texas Rangers' batting instructor; Matt Galante, the Astros' first-base coach, and Bill Robinson, the Mets' hitting instructor, are believed to be among the finalists. The fifth primary candidate apparently is Jeff Torborg, a former Yankees coach, who said that he was interviewed Sunday by Wood. . . . The Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to terms on a one-year contract with Fernando Valenzuela. Financial terms were not disclosed. The accord leaves the World Series champions with seven players eligible for free agency. One of them, Alfredo Griffin, the shortstop, filed yesterday.(AP)
