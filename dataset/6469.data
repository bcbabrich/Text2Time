WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 â€” The House Rules Committee dealt a serious and possibly fatal blow today to legislation to establish an independent consumer protection agency in the executive branch.

Proponents failed by one vote to muster a majority of the committee to clear a bill for House consideration. The tally was 7 to 7.

The Senate passed a similar bill yesterday, 74 to 4.

In the Rules Committee to day the absence of one mem ber, Representative Richard Bolling, Democrat of Missouri, who had been counted as supporter of the measure, was crucial.

According to the bill's chief sponsor, Representative Benja min S. Rosenthal, Democrat of Queens, Mr. Bolling was in the French West Indies . and declined to return although transportation by a private jet plane had been arranged.
