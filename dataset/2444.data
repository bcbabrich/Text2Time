At Auburn in 2003, he shared backfield time with Ronnie Brown and Carnell Williams, who were selected second and fifth over all in the draft in April. Jacobs then transferred to Southern Illinois, where he rushed for 922 yards and 19 touchdowns last season.

Along the way, coaches have broached the topic of changing his position. At Auburn, he tried tight end and linebacker when he realized he was not the top running back.

"None of it worked," he said. "None of it was me. I tried, but I had to do what was best for me."

He parlayed that into a chance with the Giants, a team with an annual vacancy for a backup running back.

Barber said he thought Cloud would fill the role admirably this year and that Jacobs and Derrick Ward, a second-year player, represented the future. In recent seasons, it has been far too easy for Giants coaches to leave Barber on the field for nearly every play. He has been increasingly productive; he rushed for a career-high and franchise-record 1,518 yards last season, despite playing behind a leaky offensive line. He is the franchise leader in rushing yards (6,927) and receptions (474 catches).

Despite his age, 30, and his high-mileage body, Barber says he believes he has several seasons of success ahead.

"I think it's a myth that's being disproved as the years go on by, guys like myself and Curtis Martin and Corey Dillon who's 30 as well," Barber said. "It's all a function of how much work you put in, how you take care of your body, how you keep yourself healthy.

"I've been able to do that the last few years. As long as you still have the desire, you can play this game as long as you want. Eventually you'll slow down."
