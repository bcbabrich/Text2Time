SAN DIEGO, Nov. 2 (AP)—A former auditor for C. Arnholt Smith was arrested today on a complaint charging him with, the attempted extortion of between $10‐million and $20‐million from Mr. Smith, a financier and a friend of President Nixon.

Pliny A. Daggett, 50 years old, identified as the auditor, until 1971 for 10 corporations controlled by Mr. Smith, was arrested along with his brother, Robert P. Daggett, 49, by Federal and state agents.

At a news conference, District Attorney Ed Miller said the brothers would be arraigned on state charges of solicitation to commit perjury, attempted extortion, conspiracy to bribe and delivery of a threat to extort.

The two men were later to appear before a United States magistrate on a Federal complaint charging them with conspiracy to commit perjury and conspiracy to obstruct justice, Mr. Miller said.
