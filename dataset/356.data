“Jezebels” is the name of the brothel Offred and Fred find themselves at. (The men of Gilead obviously don’t believe in subtlety.) “It’s like walking into the past, don’t you think?” Fred says. It’s more like a warped image of the past. The women are in various states of undress, their bodies covered in glitter, makeup, leather and sequins. The one thing they all share is a hollow look in their eyes that communicates the precarious situation they’re forced into. Some of them are former prostitutes, but several of them were also professors, journalists, lawyers and acclaimed chefs. What unites them all is an understanding of their own worth and autonomy. It isn’t any surprise that Gilead would shuttle the most intelligent and successful women to a fate such as this. When Offred catches sight of Moira across the room, the episode becomes electrifying. The most moving scene is when they finally get to talk after Offred slips out of Fred’s hotel room.

Unfortunately, we receive no flashback to Moira’s time from right after she parted ways with Offred at the train station. Instead we get a few minutes in which Moira is able to recount what happened. Apparently, she was able to make her way to a Quaker family that had a safe house. She made her way through the underground that provides refuge for handmaids trying to escape. But for Moira, escape became impossible when her associates were killed. She was given a choice: the colonies or Jezebels.

Moira tries to soften the story with jokes and nonchalance. But what happens at Jezebels is a form of ritualized rape that’s just as harrowing as what the handmaids experience. This has all the makings of a gripping story, so it’s a shame that Moira hasn’t gotten an episode that explores her perspective as a black lesbian. Why would Luke get an entire episode to himself rather than Moira? Why is Nick given flashbacks but not her? Samira Wiley is utterly captivating, but her performance is not enough to distract me from a troubling issue: For a show so concerned with the fates of women oppressed by a sexist, fascist dystopia, “The Handmaid’s Tale” spends far too much time exploring the perspectives of its male characters.

“We’re alone, June,” Moira warns. “Just take care of yourself.” But Offred has other plans. She’s been radicalized by her time in Gilead. In her closet, she adds a companion message to the Latin inscription carved by the previous Offred: “You are not alone.” In doing so, Offred refutes the cynicism that Moira is using to survive. It’s one of the many inspiring moments that “The Handmaid’s Tale” loves to end on. But it’s not a moment that feels earned.
