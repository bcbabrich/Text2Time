In its glory, the Bronx Democratic machine was the domain of bosses named Flynn and Buckley, whose voices reverberated from the Grand Concourse to Pennsylvania Avenue. And in its shame, the weakened machine of the 1980's was scandalized by the jailing of politicians named Simon and Friedman.

Now, with the machine age of politics dead and the Bronx reborn by new waves of immigrants, the leadership of the once fabled and feared Democratic Party organization has passed to a man named Ramirez.

The election of Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez last week as the first Hispanic county political chairman in the state is a sign of ever-molting city politics, with one ethnic group shedding power and others moving to the fore. In this case, the change is a victory for Hispanic politicians, most notably for Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, who is widely considered a likely challenger to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997.

But it is an indication of the feeble health of once-powerful political organizations in the city that when Mr. Ramirez ran for the citywide post of public advocate last year, the Bronx party apparatus couldn't even turn out enough votes for him to carry the borough.
