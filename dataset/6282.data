SAIGON, South Vietnam, Dec. 1 — American intelligence sources say that North Vietnam has shifted almost all its antiaircraft defenses to its southern sector, in what they interpret as an indication that Hanoi does not expect to provoke the United States into resumption of the bombing farther north.

The sources also said that, since the halt in mid‐October of bombing north of the 20th Parallel, the North Vietnamese have repaired the two main rail lines from Hanoi and the port of Haiphong to China and have run shuttle trains between major obstacles such as bridges destroyed by the bombing, which began last April.

“They are working on the bigger projects like rebuilding the bridges,” a senior official said, “and it is clear they do not contemplate doing anything now that would provoke a resumption of the bombing up there.”

In the view of the intelligence officials, the planning for a cease‐fire is as inexorable and irrevocable in Hanoi as in Washington.
