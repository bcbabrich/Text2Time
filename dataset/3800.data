Once it became clear that no catastrophe was on the way, the guidelines were relaxed and the whole field fell under routine supervision by regulatory agencies. True, some critics still complain that genetic engineering is booming ahead without adequate public discussion or vigorous oversight. But now the more frequent complaint is that progress is too slow, the benefits long in coming. The genetically engineered tomatoes are hard and flavorless, the genetically engineered bovine growth hormone to boost milk production is meeting resistance, and most biotech companies have yet to show a profit.

Fears that gene splicing might be misapplied to humans have also proved unfounded. Gene therapy to cure disease has progressed much slower than hoped and has thus far been applied to cases almost everyone would find ethical -- replacing a defective gene with a good one in an effort to cure an inherited disease, for example. A consensus has developed, reinforced by government guidelines, that gene therapy will be tried only on somatic cells that affect an individual patient, not on the reproductive, or germ, cells that will affect future generations. So far as is known, no one is trying germ line experiments and no one is trying to produce a more perfect human being in a new wave of eugenics.

Now the cloning breakthrough is upon us. Scientists have finally cloned an adult animal, a big step beyond the past cloning of embryos and fetuses. This is a striking technical achievement, for it shows that mature cells can be reprogrammed to start anew and produce a younger twin of an adult with known characteristics. The immediate goals are in animal husbandry. Some scientists hope to take a cow that produces a lot of high-quality milk -- perhaps one that has first been genetically modified to do so -- and then clone its cells to produce multiple copies. Genetic alteration is notoriously hit-or-miss and it would be highly useful, once a ''supercow' is produced, to be able to multiply its numbers more easily. But whether the new techniques will work efficiently must still be demonstrated.

Meanwhile, there is not likely to be any great rush to clone humans. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how such cloning could even be tested, given the high likelihood of producing malformed babies or fetuses in the process.

None of this is to deny that cloning raises tough ethical questions, such as potential loss of individuality when one's genetic identify is deliberately copied, or possible abuses in the hands of a dictator or megalomaniac multimillionaire. The apprehension over cloning will be useful if it triggers a deeper debate on the dangers. But if recent history is any guide, Nature will prove far more intractable than expected, and the cloners far less diabolical than feared. PHILIP M. BOFFEY
