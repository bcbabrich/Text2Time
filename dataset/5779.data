HEAT AND HUMIDITY grip Miami every day of a long summer that stretches past September to the last weeks of October. In July and August, the discomfort index is as high as the new downtown skyline. The heat is even more oppressive in the northern reaches of the city, in a decaying suburb-turned-ghetto called Opa-Locka, a forgotten 1920's oasis of ersatz Moorish architecture and littered streets with whimsical names like Ali Baba Boulevard. In this setting, the Miami Dolphins, the 1984 American Football Conference champions, prepare for another season on the athletic fields of St. Thomas University, a Roman Catholic campus of low, concrete-block buildings and scrub pine.

Heat shimmers and billows from the ground as squads of players, each wearing about 25 pounds of equipment, push themselves through two punishing, 90-minute drills a day. During morning practice, the field is airless and bathed in full sunshine, a combination that makes even the casual stroller break out in a sweat. Players who Jon Nordheimer is The Times's bureau chief in Miami. are free agents hoping to make the team and those from the draft who want to break into the starting lineup quickly discover in the six-week training camp whether their bodies and minds are tough enough to withstand the punishment dished out by the broiling south Florida climate . . . and by Don Shula, head coach of the Dolphins.

''I like to think that I'm intense and driven,'' Shula says, with a crooked smile in the direction of those who suggest that the point of all those stories - many of them unflattering - is essentially true: that he is the National Football League's toughest taskmaster since Vince Lombardi of Wisconsin's Green Bay Packers. But unlike Lombardi, Shula has demonstrated an impressive flexibility in offensive strategy. He was capable of employing a grind'em-out running offense for his 1970's teams, and in the last two years he has developed one of the most successful passing games in the history of the N.F.L. (For Shula's comments on three of his finest quarterbacks, see box, page 19.) At the age of 55, Shula, head coach of the Dolphins since 1970 and for seven previous seasons with the Baltimore Colts, has the best career winning average (.716) among active coaches with 10 or more years in the N.F.L. (Lombardi's average was .740.) He is arguably the most widely admired coach in professional football in addition to being one of the best paid in all professional sports, with a three-year contract that reportedly pays him at least $800,000 a year -more than his star players (although the quarterback Dan Marino is demanding a contract from club owner Joe Robbie that would pay over $1 million yearly). Shula, Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys and Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers have between them sent 15 teams to the Super Bowl since 1969, a figure representing almost half of the total number of teams represented in play at Super Bowls over that period.

Renowned for his insistence on rigorous physical and mental preparation, as well as his bursts of abusive language and iron-glove discipline, Shula is no longer the explosive, hot-tempered coach who cowed players, referees, assistants and members of the press with the manic intensity of one who placed winning above everything. But the new, mellow Shula is no less demanding than in the old days, and anyone who confuses the crooked smile with an easing of discipline learns in summer camp that it is as much a mirage as the wavy bands of heat rising from the sun-blasted playing field.
