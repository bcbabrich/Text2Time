To the Editor:

Re ''Treating Shareholders Like Workers'' (editorial, May 29): Regarding California's Proposition 226, I do not understand how you can equate a shareholder in a corporation with a worker who as a condition of employment must pay union dues. A shareholder can sell his stake in a company that supports political entities he finds offensive.

The question has been settled by the Supreme Court, which affirmed union members' right to a refund of the portion of their dues not used for collective bargaining. Since the National Labor Relations Board refuses to enforce the decision, frustrated workers need Proposition 226.
