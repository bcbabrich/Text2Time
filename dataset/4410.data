The autobiographical strain continues in the tentlike "Singer House." Its thin frame structure is made of yardsticks hung with pairs of scissors, its sides of sewing patterns; ribbons and dress trimmings stream from its roof. At its center, raised on a big, heart-shaped pincushion of red velvet, sits a 1940's Singer sewing machine encrusted with pearls. A wall text says that the work is dedicated to Mr. Martorell's mother, who supported her family as a seamstress, and by extension to all the women who have earned their livelihood through sewing in the Caribbean or in Manhattan sweatshops, like those in SoHo that have only recently been displaced by art galleries.

The immigrant experience itself is one of the show's recurring motifs. Just as most of the installations in "A House for Us All" were created in Puerto Rico and are very likely to return there at the end of this exhibition's run, one of the defining features of the "Nuyorican" experience is the frequent shuttling from the island to the mainland and back. Mr. Martorell's work suggests that this commute has produced not only a vital hybrid culture, but also an odd sense of psychological suspension between the Caribbean home and the northern city that holds the possibility of economic survival.

Interestingly, this state of perpetual transience is most directly addressed by the show's only site-specific work, commissioned by El Museo del Barrio. Titled "House in Mid-Air," it simulates the tunnel-like interior of a small commercial shuttle plane, although here the seats are a collection of fabulously embroidered lawn chairs and rockers, the windows are mirrors framed with pom-pon tassels, the walls are covered with the text of a provocative story by the Puerto Rican writer Luis Rafael Sanchez, and a small plastic radio plays salsa throughout the trip. "House in Mid-Air" is a physically dense piece, although, like everything else here, it has a sense of improvisational deftness, as if it had been created in a single work-intensive session.

Other pieces in the show are more spare, even severe. Some of them are obviously political in meaning. The decorative window grilles that form "The Green House," for example, are used as security devices in Puerto Rican homes, but here they are ornamented with rows of pennies. And at least one installation is literally poetic. The paper "Rilke's House" takes the form of a huge air-mail envelope, with woodcut portraits of the German writer Rainer Maria Rilke stamped on the outside and passages from his "Letters to a Young Poet" written in flowing script on the interior. "Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance," reads one of its lines.

In fact, it is exactly a sense of having been conceived and executed out of love and affirmation that makes this show so moving and puts it in an odd position in the present art climate. Although museums and academic art departments are paying lip service to exploring the contemporary art of all world cultures, there appears to be a firm institutional line drawn between the often didactic, ironic, theory-driven work that has dominated New York in the last decade and the emotionally open, intensely metaphorical art represented by "A House for Us All."
