The Oklahoma Industries Authority is selling $75.96 million in tax-exempt hospital revenue bonds tentatively priced to yield a maximum of about 7.17 percent for an issue due in 2014 through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. For shorter maturities, the issuer is offering yields ranging from 6.20 percent in 1993 to 6.40 percent in 1995, 6.75 percent in 2000 and 6.90 percent in 2002. All of the bonds in this issue are insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, the underwriters said. And for that reason, the securities are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Proceeds from the sale will be used for the Baptist Medical Center of Oklahoma.
