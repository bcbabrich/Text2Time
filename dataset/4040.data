THE first mutual fund to invest in gay-friendly companies tries not only to identify those that already have progressive policies but also to persuade other companies to meet its criteria.

''We like to think of ourselves as socially proactive,'' said Shelly J. Meyers, a 37-year-old lesbian who manages the new Meyers Sheppard Pride fund in Beverly Hills, Calif.

The fund has pressed two companies to adopt an explicit policy of not discriminating against gay people in its hiring and promotion practices, Ms. Meyers said. And it has invested in one of those companies, a small software outfit that Ms. Meyers declined to name. The fund also plans to encourage companies to become even more gay-friendly, by taking measures like allowing domestic partners of same-sex couples to receive health insurance benefits.

''It was important that Disney did not give an inch when it was criticized for its health benefits'' to domestic partners of same-sex couples, Ms. Meyers said. ''I think it's very, very important for Disney to take a stand.''
