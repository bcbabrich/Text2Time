WHEN Joan Fleming received the Crime Writers Association's top award last year for “When I Grow Rich,” I was delighted not only by this prize for one of my own favorite suspense novels, but by the overdue recognition of the author herself, a consistently admirable and versatile maker whose entire corpus of novels is a distinguished one. As I have often remarked, she never writes the same book twice, but even she reaches a new extent of versatility in THE CHILL AND THE KiLL (Washburn, $3.95), which should be eagerly claimed by the science‐fiction enthusiasts as well as by the suspense buffs,

For this is about a genuine case of extrasensory perception, particularly precognition. A hitherto unexceptional adolescent girl develops, after the shock of a minor accident, a wild talent for foretelling the future: marriages, arrivals, deaths and a murder. But such startling aperçus are often imperfect; and when the foreseen murder happens, even the young prophetess does not know whodunit. This is an adroit plot for combining mystery and s.f. (though Miss Fleming and Dr. J. B. Rhine might argue that E.S.P. should by now be classed as recognized fact), and the treatment is excellent—a fine depiction of an English village rich in complex and unstereo typed characters, including the sensitively drawn E.S.P.er herself.

One of fiction's best private detectives, solidly and humanly in the Hammett (rather than the Spillane) tradition, is the Chicago eye whose only name is Mac. In Thomas B. Dewey's DON'T CRY FOR LONG (Simon & Schuster, $3.50), he becomes accidentally (and without pay) involved in the affairs of a controversial Congressman with a sexy and treacherous daughter. Strong suspense, hard action, firm characterizations.

Lighter variants of the private eye: Shell Scott encounters, on an Arizona dude ranch, a gaggle of gangsters and the all‐female cast of a nude Western film in Richard S. Prather's THE COCKEYED CORPSE (Gold Medal, 40 cents). The action is as briskly entertaining as the title is irrelevant. . . . Rick Holman, in Carter Brown's MURDER IS A PACKAGE DEAL (Signet, 40 cents), undertakes to free a fading filmstar from blackmail and walks into two murders. Conventonal but fast, with a few nice macabre touches, . . . Mavis Seidlitz, in order to protect a threatened stripper, turns stripper herself in Carter Brown's TIHE BUMP AND GRINND lMURDERS (Signet, 40 cents). Some of Mavis's Gracie ‐ Allen ‐ plus sex humor is as strained as her bra‐straps; but the plot culminates in a fine sequence of double and triple crosses.
