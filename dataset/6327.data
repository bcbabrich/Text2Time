The new law received wide support, even from church groups, because of a wide spread feeling that previous rules had harmful effects, par ticularly on children. Lengthy court fights often left a residue of hostility between parents that placed a tremendous bur den on their offspring.

“The important thing is to salvage the relationship between parents and their children,” said Edward M. Raskin, chair man of the family law commit tee for the California Bar Asso ciation.

“If the husband and wife are bitter toward each other, the bitterness shouldn't filter down to the children.”

Petitions for divorce can still be contested, but the grounds for such contests are now con siderably weaker. As Mr. Ras kin said:

“If a woman says she can't stand living with a man be cause he snores, that is an ir reconcilable difference regard less of the fact that he can't help himself. Previously, snor ing would not have been con sidered cruelty. But if a wom an just can't stand living with a man, or vice versa, that Wouli, be enough.”

Some have complained that a person whose spouse is clear ly at fault should be entitled to a larger share of the com munity property, particularly if the innocent party is a woman.

But the new law provides that a woman — even if she were responsible for the break up—can now collect alimony if she cannot support herself. Previously, the person consid' ered at fault had no right to alimony.

The new statute reduces the residency requirement for a di. vorce from one year to six months. The period between which a temporary decree is entered and the final divorce is granted was also reduced from a year to six months.
