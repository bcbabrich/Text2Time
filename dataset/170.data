Then comes an amazing coincidence. (Hannah likes these.) A war buddy of Ernt’s has left him a cabin and some land in Alaska. The Allbrights pile in their Volkswagen bus and go off seeking a new adventure. In her acknowledgments, Hannah writes that her own family, with an apparently much happier father, piled into its own VW bus for similarly searching travels in 1968.

This is the kind of book in which the Alaskan cabin is a horrible mess until, practically overnight, it’s fresh and clean — not easy without running water. That’s because the tiny outpost near Homer, where the Allbrights homestead (in real life, Hannah’s family runs a travel lodge in the same general area) has citizens who help one another and show up to share the work. This setup suits Ernt for about five minutes. Then he starts bonding with Mad Earl (“folks call me Mad Earl”), the biggest paranoid white supremacist survivalist nut around, whom Ernt will soon best when it comes to crazy. Ernt also starts hating Tom Walker, the local rich person, who has no discernible bad qualities and does his best to help the Allbrights. Walker’s big crime is that Cora finds him attractive.

Now to the main event: Ernt goes from intimidating his wife and daughter to seriously beating Cora. And in a one-room log cabin, Leni can’t not see what’s going on. Hannah presents a sickeningly codependent marriage in which Mama makes excuses for Dad’s violence and refuses to tell anyone what’s happening to her, no matter how bad it gets. Cora is covering for Ernt for emotional, not practical, reasons. Still, she wouldn’t get anywhere by going to the police; as the book points out, 1974 was a time when a woman with a job couldn’t get a credit card without a man’s permission.

Hannah manages to keep all this from getting too repetitive by steadily raising the stakes. By the middle of the book, Leni is 17, and there is a boy — Tom Walker’s son, of course. (In this backwater, there’s only one boy around anyway.) But Dad would prefer that Leni jump out of bed in the middle of the night and clean her gun than socialize with anybody, ever. So she begins to face the major questions of if or how she will ever have a life of her own.

“The Great Alone” is packed with rapturous descriptions of Alaskan scenery, which are the most reliably alluring part of it. Hannah remembers and summons an undeveloped wilderness, describing a gloriously pristine region in the days before cruise ships discovered it. One of the fighting points in the book is whether the little enclave the Allbrights call home should be opened up to tourists. Hannah presumably has mixed feelings about this, what with her family’s travel lodge. But she keeps it simple in the book, making Ernt the purist and Tom Walker the guy who sees tourism as inevitable. Tom shuts Ernt down by saying, “I got boots that have covered more ground in Alaska than you have.”
