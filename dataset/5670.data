Nightmarish scenarios about the sequence of events that might plausibly lead to a superpower nuclear exchange are all too familiar by now. Much less common - indeed, virtually unheard of - are scenarios that could plausibly lead to nuclear disarmament.

Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko may take a step toward peace when they meet in Geneva on Jan. 7 and 8, but neither side has any illusions that the path will be an easy one. If President Reagan is, as he says, genuinely committed to ''arms reductions,'' he will have to persevere along this path despite endless twists and turns and temporary setbacks. Let us imagine one such route - and the possible reward waiting at the end. Granted, it sounds pretty unlikely, but it could happen if we're determined enough. Early January 1985. During the Geneva talks, the United States and Russia signal their willingness to slow the arms race. The psychological tensions of the competition and the strains on each side's economies have produced a parallel national consensus for disarmament.

Late January 1985. In his State of the Union Message, President Reagan startles friends and critics alike by announcing a 180-day ''moratorium'' on nuclear testing and production. In a symbolic act, he orders the destruction of a dozen thermonuclear warheads (out of 25,000), challenging the Russians to ''match this act of faith as a first step toward a nuclear- free future for the children of this beautiful planet.''

February 1985. Tass denounces the President's Sadat-like gesture as ''Hollywood arms control,'' saying, ''The Americans began the arms race, and it will take more than gestures to end it.''
