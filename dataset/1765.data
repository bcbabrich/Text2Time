Violinists, bassoonists and timpanists in Cuba? Fine. A bevy of rich Americans? Sorry.

The New York Philharmonic scratched its trip to Cuba at the end of October because the United States Treasury Department said it would deny permission for a group of patrons to go along. Without them and their donations, the orchestra said on Thursday, it cannot afford to go.

About 150 board members and other donors had promised to pay $10,000 each to spend Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Havana, where the orchestra was to play two concerts, said Zarin Mehta, its president. The money was to have covered the cost of the proposed trip, which came at the Cuban government’s invitation.

Supporters, both individuals and executives of donor companies, usually tag along with major orchestras when they travel around the world. The travel amounts to high-class tourism along with a chance to make business connections in foreign capitals.

“The patrons were excited about giving us the money with the opportunity of going to see Havana and be a witness and support their orchestra,” said Zarin Mehta, the Philharmonic’s president. “This is what’s important to them.” Mr. Mehta said he would not consider taking the patrons’ money while leaving them behind.

“I wouldn’t want to insult them,” he said. “I think it’s most likely they would say, ‘Go another time.’” That’s what the orchestra will try to do, Mr. Mehta said. He said he had hoped that pressure applied by New York elected officials, including Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representatives Steve Israel and Charles B. Rangel — who have supported the trip — would help to have the decision overturned.

“They haven’t been successful,” he said. “They’re befuddled.”

The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control issues licenses to visit Cuba because of the longstanding economic sanctions aimed at the government of Fidel Castro. The office told the orchestra that the players and staff members would be allowed to go, but not the patrons. It has already issued two licenses for orchestra officials who went on logistical missions.

Mr. Mehta said the orchestra had been told that the patrons would be excluded because they were not performers.

A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, Marti Adams, said that the department would not comment on license applications for Cuba. The office said it issued 21 licenses last year under the performing-arts category.

The orchestra has delivered a legal brief to the licensing office making its case that the nonperforming donors should be allowed to go.

When the orchestra made headlines with a trip to Pyongyang, North Korea, nearly two years ago, a group of patrons needed no permission to go along. The orchestra leaves on Sunday for an Asian tour that will include another Communist nation, Vietnam.

Mr. Mehta said the next opening for a Cuba trip would probably come in June or July. The orchestra will try to come up with other concerts quickly to play at its Avery Fisher home at Lincoln Center when it would have been in Havana.

As for programming on those dates, Mr. Mehta said, Latin-American music is a distinct possibility. “The thought has crossed our minds,” he said.
