IN the first five months of this year, companies with speculative credit ratings issued a huge amount of debt. But lately it has become harder to find enthusiastic buyers of their junk bonds.

Through May, the volume of new high-yield, or junk, bonds was up 53 percent compared with the corresponding period of 2002, according to Thomson Financial. And May has been one of the busiest months ever, with $17.8 billion of such bonds sold.

Seeking yields higher than the meager rates offered on safer bonds, investors piled into junk-bond mutual funds. But recent data suggests that redemptions from such funds are rising.

Bruce H. Monrad, the chairman of Northeast Investors Trust in Boston, with $1.8 billion under management, most of it in high-yield bonds, talked last week about the junk-bond market. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. According to Moody's Investors Service, the default rate on corporate bonds stood at 5.8 percent for the 12 months ended April 30. That's down from 11.5 percent for the year ended Jan. 1, 2002. Are fundamental conditions positive for high-yield bonds?
