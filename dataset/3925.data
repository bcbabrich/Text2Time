A meeting that could determine the Nets' immediate future will take place tomorrow when General Manager Willis Reed and the team president, Michael Rowe, meet with Kenny Anderson's lawyer, David Falk, to discuss whether the point guard would reconsider and accept a six-year, $40 million offer to remain with the club.

But the way things have been going for the Nets these days, Anderson's muddled contract situation is the least of their concerns. A 120-110 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Saturday night at Byrne Meadowlands Arena exposed the Nets as a team approaching desperate trouble.

The Warriors are the kind of team the Nets have to beat at home if they are going to contend for a playoff spot this season. Even though they are one of the league's highest-scoring teams, the Warriors entered the game 11-17 over all and just 4-11 on the road.

Furthermore, the Nets (10-17) were beginning a stretch in which 8 of their next 10 games, including Saturday night, would be at home, presenting a chance to climb back to .500 again. But the Warriors outhustled and outshot the lethargic Nets, who lost for the eighth time in nine games.
