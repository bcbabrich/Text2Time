''We got interested in the family because a number of the factors in it showed enormous promise in terms of clinical applications,'' Dr. Lee said.

The family is known as transforming growth factor-beta genes. Members that Dr. Lee cited as examples included bone morphogenetic proteins, which are being tested in people as an aid to fracture healing, and a substance known as a neurotrophic factor that may prove to have a role in treating Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease.

Dr. Lee said the most immediate application of the myostatin findings might be to agriculture. Chickens, cows and pigs all have the gene, and he said that if it works in them as it does in mice, knockouts might produce twice as much meat with no more fat.

Humans also have the gene, and Dr. Lee said he hoped the research might ultimately lead to new treatments for diseases like muscular dystrophy and for the severe muscle wasting that causes disability and premature death in some people with cancer and AIDS.

''But that's a long way off,'' he added, ''years away.''

One concern is that turning off the myostatin gene might cause cancer. Other genes in its family are tumor suppressors, and when they are removed or blocked, the animals die of cancer. The new mice are being watched for this, Dr. Lee said.

So far, with some of the animals over a year old -- about half the life span of a mouse -- no tumors have been found. Except for their big muscles, the mice appear physically normal, the researchers said.

But they do behave differently from ordinary mice. Ms. McPherron, who was bitten by one of the animals at the news conference announcing their debut, nonetheless described them as gentler than normal mice, and ''a little sluggish.''
