NAGANO TO MONTREAL? -- Kent Nagano, left, is set to succeed Charles Dutoit as music director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, a report in Le Devoir, a Montreal newspaper, said. The appointment of Mr. Nagano, the artistic director and principal conductor of the Deutsches Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin, principal conductor of the Los Angeles Opera, music director of the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra in California since 1978 and designated successor in 2006 to Zubin Mehta as music director of the Bavarian State Opera, would begin with the 2006-7 season. The Montreal Symphony would not comment on the report but said it would announce a successor to Mr. Dutoit this month. The post of music director of the Montreal Symphony has been vacant since spring 2002, when Mr. Dutoit, who had held the position for 25 years, resigned abruptly after the Quebec Musicians Guild issued an open letter likening the musicians under him to battered spouses who ''have quietly endured years of verbal and psychological abuse and now want it to stop.''

KNIGHTHOOD FOR PERAHIA -- The American pianist Murray Perahia is to be made an honorary knight commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony in London next Monday. Because Mr. Perahia is not a British citizen, the knighthood, for his service to music, is honorary, The Associated Press reported. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw cited Mr. Perahia's work with the Aldeburgh Festival in eastern England, which led to a collaboration with the composer Benjamin Britten and the singer Peter Pears and Mr. Perahia's appearances as principal guest conductor of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.

ARTS AND LETTERS HONORS -- The artists Lee Bontecou and Lester Johnson; the writers Jamaica Kincaid, left, Isabel Allende, Paula Fox, James Tate and Lanford Wilson, and the composers Robert Beaser and Bernard Rands have been elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters. They will be inducted by its secretary, the poet Robert Pinsky, at the academy's annual ceremonial in May.
