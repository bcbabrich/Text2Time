President Clinton reflected somberly today on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, after a car accident in Paris.

''We liked her very much,'' the President said, speaking for himself and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''We admired her work for children, for people with AIDS, for the cause of ending the scourge of land mines in the world, and for her love for her children, William and Harry.''

White House officials said that they were waiting for word on what the funeral arrangements would be before deciding who would go, but that it was possible Mr. Clinton would attend.

Mr. Clinton sent letters of condolence to Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, Prime Minister Tony Blair and Earl Spencer, Diana's brother.
