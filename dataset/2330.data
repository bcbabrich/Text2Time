Lately I’ve apologized to Marguerite H. for suggesting that she was insensitive to genocide in Darfur, and today let me express profound contrition to a wronged breed of dog. In my Tuesday column I made a passing reference to “the White House and its Dobermans,” referring to Paul Wolfowitz, Don Rumsfeld and assorted hacks in the news media.

Deborah wrote from San Diego to take offense: “As the proud owners of 3 Doberman Pinschers for the last 25 years, we take umbrage at your attempt to compare this honest, trustworthy, loyal, courageous, loving, and devoted breed with the current occupants of the White House. No Doberman Pinscher would ever cravenly run away from a fight ala Bush, Cheney, and Wolfowitz and then, 30 years later, set loose the dogs of war while cynically accusing those objecting of cowardice and treason. You owe Dobermans everywhere an apology.”

So here it is. I’m sorry, Dobermans!
