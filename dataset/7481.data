The nation's largest wholesale drug distributor announced yesterday that it would manufacture and sell tetracycline at about one‐third the price at which it is sold by other manufacturers in the United States.

Tetracycline is a broad‐spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a variety of bacterial infections. Yearly sales in the country total about $100 million, or about a third of the total sale of antibiotics.

The announcement was made by McKesson & Robbins, which said that it would offer pills for about 6 cents each wholesale, or about $6 for 100 250‐miligram tablets. A spokesman for the company said that other drug concerns that manufacture tetracycline in the United States sell it for “slightly more than $17 a hundred tablets wholesale.”

Chas. Pfizer & Co., one of the discoverers of tetracycline, immediately announced that it would file suit against McKesson. & Robbins for patent infringement.
