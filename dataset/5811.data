As a Japanese, I am deeply skeptical of the current movement in Japan, led by Prime Minister Nakasone, to ''totally reevaluate'' postwar institutions, especially education (''How Japan Teaches Its Own History,'' by James Reston Jr., Oct. 27). At best, it can be characterized as extraordinarily naive.

At worst, it is a disingenuous attempt to smother an uncomfortable past and to throw away hard-learned historical lessons.

As Mr. Reston says, the Japanese are still very reluctant to implicate the Emperor - or any other living person - for the events that led up to the Pacific war, and this, I believe, is the main factor inhibiting scholars from doing serious research into the pre-World War II era. Such a reluctance to make a villain out of a living person is deeply rooted in our culture and, although from a Western point of view it may seem cowardly or even hypocritical, it cannot be altogether rejected. However, it does mean that we are culturally and psychologically still far from being able to claim that the ''postwar era'' is over, as Mr. Nakasone tries to do. MISTUHIRO KAWASE Princeton, N.J.
