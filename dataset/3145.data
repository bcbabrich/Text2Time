Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, explore first-hand accounts and pictures of refugees, focusing initially on child refugees in Chechnya. They then create collages that describe, through words and images, the experience of refugees in countries at war.



Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Imagine what it might be like to be a refugee from a country at war; explore words that convey the feelings they might have from such an experience.

2. Learn how Chechen children are finding refuge in Russia by attending special summer camps by reading and discussing “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War.”

3. Explore the experiences of refugees in various countries; create collages for a museum exhibit entitled “The Refugee Experience.”

4. Individually reflect on the experience of refugees in one country; develop a short creative work that expresses the thoughts and feelings of refugees from that country.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-classroom board

-copies of “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War” (one per student)

-resources about refugee experiences around the world (global history textbooks, encyclopedias, periodicals, computers with Internet access)

-poster board (one per small group)

-markers, colored pencils, tape or glue sticks (enough for each small group)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: Students respond to the following scenario in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “Imagine that you have lived your entire life in a country at war. Many of your relatives have been in the war. Some have died. Others have fled. You and your immediate family are now forced to flee. Write five words that describe how you might feel.” Ask students to share their responses, record their words on the board. Group related concepts. Then, as a class, discuss the following questions: Can we know what such an experience would be like without experiencing it ourselves? Can poetry or works of art communicate this experience? What are some images or phrases that come to mind that might better convey what these individual words are meant to evoke?

2. As a class, read and discuss “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Who are the guests in a Russian village near Nizhy Novgorod, and why are they there?

b. What will these guests do in this village?

c. Why is it unusual for Russians to show “such kindness” to Chechens? d. What human rights groups have helped make this experience possible for Chechen children?

e. What does Dr. Maria Tarakanova mean when she says, “But Russians can be the same”?

f. According to the article, who are some of the other children of the war in Chechnya?

g. Why would were some of the soldiers described by Maryam Kurkayeva ashamed to accept the food she offered?

h. How many Chechen children might spend time at Russian camps this year, according to Russian officials cited in the article? Why are there so many?

i. According to the article, how many residents of Nizhny Novgorod opposed the camps? What reasons does the article give for why sentiments have changed?

j. What background into the war in Chechnya is offered in this article? What information do you still want to learn about it?

3. Divide the class into pairs or small groups of four, and assign each group a country with a large population of refugees. Suggested countries include (but are not limited to) Bosnia, Cambodia, Chechnya, Kosovo, Sudan, Tibet, and Vietnam. Explain to students that each group will be acting as co-curators in a museum exhibit entitled “The Refugee Experience.” Each group will use a collection of words and images to create a collage poster that describe the experience of refugees in their assigned country. Using all available classroom resources, one or two students in each group will be responsible for finding images that depict the refugee experience in this country [you may want to direct students to the New York Times photo section (//www.nytimes.com/photos). The other one or two students will be responsible for finding personal stories from voice recordings and written accounts from refugees from their assigned country [you may want to refer students to the Refugee Voices archive at the U.S. Committee for Refugees (//www.refugees.org/field/listen_archive.htm)]. Then, using the images and texts gathered, each group creates a collage poster. If necessary, the collages may be finished for homework or in future class periods.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Prior to the end of class, hand each student a copy of the following excerpt from “Aman, the Story of a Somali Girl,” or write the excerpt on the board for them to copy (“Aman, the Story of a Somali Girl,” Virginia Lee Barnes and Janice Boddy, Toronto and New York: Vintage, 1995]:

“My mama and grandmama had been traveling for a couple of days, walking miles and miles with their animals, searching for water. Mama was nine months pregnant. When you live out in the bush with animals … you’ve got to find water and grass for them. Some people go where water has fallen – you have to follow the rain.”

Ask students to write a short piece in a similar style that describes the experience of a child refugee from the country they investigated in class. In a future class, display the collage posters and writings to create your “The Refugee Experience” exhibit. Invite other classes to view the exhibit.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Who are the groups fighting in Chechnya? Who are the rebels, and what do they want?

–What is an oral history? How do oral histories differ from other historical accounts? What role does subjective experience play in an account of history?

–Do you agree with Dr. Maria Tarakanova when she says “children, whether they are Armenian, Chechen or Russian, are all the same”? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class discussions, participation in group research, thoughtful completion of group collages, and thoughtfully written first-person depictions of the experiences of refugee children.

Vocabulary:

respite, sanitariums, liturgies, refugee, anthem, conscripts, chaperone, demobilized, muster, offspring, militia, impoverished, tolerant, sentiment

Extension Activities:

1. Using historic periodicals, Web sites, and other resources, explore in greater depth the country assigned to your group in class. Create an illustrated timeline of the conflict that sent the refugees in that country into exile. What groups were fighting each other? When did the conflict first arise? What subsequent conflicts arose through time? What events caused refugees to leave that country? How many refugees fled and where did they resettle?

2. Using cardboard, paper, clay, and other materials, create a topographical map of Chechnya. What countries surround Chechnya? How have the topographical features of Chechnya influenced political boundaries in that region? How have these features influenced the war there?

3. Research the organizations that help refugees. What type of aid is available for war refugees? What goods and services are needed by refugees? How can individuals who want to help refugees become involved? Organize a drive for clothing, toys, or other goods that will aid refugees from a country you studied in class.

4. Find a pen-pal network and set up correspondence with a refugee student from the country you studied in class.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics- Research refugee situations around the world at the site of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (//www.unhcr.ch/welcome.htm), and write an article titled “Who Is a Refugee?” Can soldiers be refugees? Can criminals? What rights do refugees have, according to the United Nations?

Fine Arts- Listen to the song “Imagine” by John Lennon. What was the artist trying to convey in this song? Does the information you gathered in class relate in any way to this song? Write your own song that conveys how people should live in the world. What lyrical images might convey what you learned about the refugees studied in class?

Health- According to the article, “many of the Chechen children bear the psychological or physical scars of war.” Research the health problems of refugees who resettle in a new country. What health effects do traumatizing experiences cause? What treatments are available? Find the programs in your community that help refugees to cope with these problems, and write a guidebook of programs for helping refugees in your community. If possible, visit the organizations sponsoring these programs and find out how you can help.

Journalism- Interview someone who has experienced war first-hand, and write an article describing what you learn. What war did this person experience? What was his or her “participation” in this war? Did he or she support the war? Why or why not? How did the experience change this person? Would the person be willing to participate in the same way again? Why or why not?
