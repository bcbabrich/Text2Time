A month ago, Mr. Jordan, now an executive with the Washington Wizards N.B.A. team, told a reporter that after his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contracts expired in the next few years, he would shift toward managing his own businesses.

That lesson has not been lost on the N.B.A., which has been moving aggressively to find new ways to profit from the league.

N.B.A. Entertainment, a unit created in 1982, produces television and movie programming centered on the N.B.A. There is also a theme restaurant, N.B.A. City in Orlando, a series of popular N.B.A. home videos and even a sitcom in the works. And this week, the N.B.A. was host to a celebrity fashion show featuring N.B.A. players alongside the actress Carmen Electra, as a way to increase sales of its merchandise and promote the idea that the league is a trendsetter in the fashion world.

''The line between sports and entertainment has become nearly nonexistent,'' Mr. Brew at Addison said. ''It's now an organization that is entertainment-based rather than sports-based.''

Indeed, ''Michael Jordan to the Max,'' could not come at a better time for the N.B.A. The playoffs are just under way, and the league is suffering from television ratings that are down sharply since Mr. Jordan retired in 1998. But Mr. Jordan's star has not yet dimmed.

''There's no question he has staying power; he hasn't disappeared from the map at all,'' said Gregory K. Leonard, an economist who in 1997 released a study showing that in the early 1990's, Mr. Jordan bolstered league revenues by about $53 million a year. ''But it's unclear how long this will last because there haven't been that many precedents.''

The IMAX film will allow the N.B.A. to ride the coattails of the most celebrated person to ever play the game. And if the film does gross $100 million in the first year, the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan can thank Don and Steve Kempf, who produced and directed the IMAX project with James D. Stern, a theater and film producer from Chicago.
