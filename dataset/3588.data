The popularity of cruises to Alaska shows no sign of abating; this season Holland America and Princess, bitter rivals, will offer 120 and 101 sailings respectively, while Celebrity's Mercury, delivered last fall, will join its sister ship, the Galaxy, in Alaska for a total of 38 Alaska sailings.

But the most heavily traveled cruise lanes remain those of the Caribbean, which attracted more than half of the almost 4.7 million people who cruised last year. Nevertheless, Norwegian Cruise Line's decision to keep the Norway in the Caribbean only six months instead of 12 (it is being deployed to Europe and the Mediterranean, in pursuit of higher per diems) led to talk that the Caribbean was finally losing its appeal.

That could happen, of course, but other cruise lines are betting against it -- to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, the $450 million, 2,600-passenger Grand Princess, scheduled for delivery in May, will become the second cruise ship (after the Carnival Destiny) deliberately built too wide -- 43 feet too wide -- to cross the Panama Canal, because it is destined for the Caribbean. And all three of Royal Caribbean's 3,100-passenger ''eagle class'' ships, due in 1999, 2000 and 2001, will be too wide for the Panama Canal.

Meanwhile, Carnival is offering 579 Caribbean cruises on 11 ships -- including the 2,040-passenger Paradise, its second new ship set for this year, and the first cruise ship to ban smoking for passengers and crew.

(Almost all cruise ships prohibit smoking in restaurants and theaters, and most permit cigar and pipe smoking only on deck. Most also allow smoking in cabins. But there are a number of variations. Windstar, for example, allows cigarettes in designated sections of restaurants and lounges, while Princess allows it in sections of its bars. Celebrity allows smoking on the port side of the deck only. Radisson's Paul Gauguin has a Connoisseur's Club where aficionados can buy and smoke cigars in a specially ventilated area. Carnival allows cigars and pipes in designated areas, except on the Paradise.)

Almost all the other cruise lines will also sail the Caribbean this year, including Royal Caribbean with 350 cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line with 239, Holland America with 152 and Celebrity with 122.

Elsewhere, Royal Caribbean's 2,000-passenger Vision of the Seas, set to enter service this May, is designed to sail the Mediterranean in summer, the Canada-New England coast in the fall and the Panama Canal in winter. Carnival's 2,040-passenger Elation, due in April, will sail year-round seven-day cruises to Mexico from its home port in Los Angeles -- the first new ship ever to be based on the West Coast. Princess's 1,950-passenger Sea Princess, set for November, is destined for Alaska and the Caribbean. But most of the excitement so far revolves around the Grand Princess, which at least for this year will lay claim to being the most expensive cruise ship ever built, as well as the biggest (28 feet taller than Niagara Falls).
