American crews competing at the 151st Henley Royal Regatta continued their winning ways yesterday at Henley-on-Thames, England.

The Yale and Columbia varsity lightweights dispatched their opposition in heats of the Temple Challenge Cup, setting up a final meeting of the season today. Winning margins of less than a second separated the two crews as they traded championships in the United States, and today they will race in the quarterfinals.

In the other half of the draw, Brown's junior varsity heavyweights continue undefeated in 2000. The Rutgers lightweight varsity was the only American team to lose a Temple Cup race, to England's Oxford Brookes University.

Brown's men's varsity heavyweights scored the most impressive victory of yesterday's semifinals, in the Ladies' Challenge Plate, winning in 6 minutes 18 seconds. The Bruins will next face California, which defeated them a month ago for the United States collegiate title. Cal (6:22) advanced yesterday but struggled to a 6-foot decision over South Africa's Trident Rowing Club.
