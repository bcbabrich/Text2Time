''My final comment on these cases is that each player I met maintains he is not currently using any drugs,'' Ueberroth said yesterday. ''I have no reason to doubt this. It is, however, an established fact that the recovery rate for drug abusers is low.

''For this reason, career testing is imperative. Even with testing, recurrence is possible, but testing is simply the best device we have to deter further use or detect a new problem.''

The players, their agents and their association may well try some legal action against the sentence. But Ueberroth cut one major objection off at the pass by putting testing in the hands of a confidential agency hired by the commissioner's office. No longer can the players raise the specter of an owner rampaging through the clubhouse, handing out bottles after a tough loss.

Mandatory universal testing? That's another issue. The Pittsburgh 11 and their 10 colleagues had no leeway. Various testimony, including their own, linked them to drug usage - and facilitating others, in the case of seven - and none of them convinced Ueberroth in private interviews that it must have been some other guy. The fact is, these 21 players may have been on the road to becoming the next Micheal Ray Richardson, banned from basketball earlier this week after flunking his third chance. Drug addiction is much worse than illegal; it is life-threatening.

The players knew they would not get away without a penalty. One of the Pittsburgh 11 said this winter that he knew he would be fined and tested; he never mentioned community service, which is the sleeper in Ueberroth's decision.
