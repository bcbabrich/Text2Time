The news keeps getting worse for Anthony D. Weiner.

Mr. Weiner, the disgraced former congressman whose lewd text message exchanges with a teenager spurred new federal scrutiny of Hillary Clinton’s emails in the final days of the presidential campaign, was fined $65,000 on Thursday by New York City’s Campaign Finance Board for violations during his failed bid for mayor in 2013.

Mr. Weiner’s campaign, which raised and spent millions stretching back to the 2009 race when he first made a run for mayor, is also required to return its remaining balance of $195,000, which the board said was unspent public matching funds.

Among the violations committed by Mr. Weiner’s campaign, according to the board: using campaign funds to pay for two cellphones, including the personal phone used by Mr. Weiner from May to September 2013, the height of his Democratic primary campaign.

It was during that period that new revelations of sexually explicit text messages and photographs, sent to women after he had left Congress, came to light and derailed Mr. Weiner’s bid for mayor, which had been gaining momentum — partially based on the notion that he had moved beyond his lewd messaging.
