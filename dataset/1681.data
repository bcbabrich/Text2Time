Before Chrysler can start building cars that more Americans want to buy, it will have to overcome considerable challenges, The New York Times’s David E. Sanger writes.

The biggest may be persuading its three principal new owners — the retiree benefit fund for the labor union that President Obama himself has identified as a contributor to the company’s decline; a government that insists it will keep its hands off day-to-day decisions; and a foreign car company, Fiat — to innovate in ways the carmaker has resisted for three decades.

There is reason for skepticism. For all the optimism expressed by the administration about a downsized, leaner Chrysler, the structure of the new Chrysler sets the stage for a conflict between current workers and retirees.

Chrysler’s workers, of course, are desperate to preserve their job security, their wages and their generous health care benefits, built up over years of negotiations. But it is Chrysler’s retirees who will hold a seat on the new company’s board, representing the interests of a dwindling — and expensive — retirement health plan.

“There’s a potential conflict there, absolutely,” one of Mr. Obama’s aides conceded Thursday, The Times said.

The innovative element of the new company is supposed to come from Fiat, the Italian automaker that managed a remarkable turnaround in the last five years. Fiat turns out fuel-efficient engines and sporty, economical small cars — exactly the image of the future American car industry that Mr. Obama talks glowingly about.

But when Chrysler was controlled by Daimler-Benz, one of Europe’s most successful luxury carmakers, everyone hailed the potential of great crossborder synergies. They simply never materialized.

Members of the team that negotiated the deal insisted on Thursday that they had explored all those risks as they revamped Chrysler and faced down a group of recalcitrant lenders who, on Wednesday night, balked at taking a deal that would give them about 28 cents for every dollar they had lent the company over the years, The Times said.

The United Automobile Workers will not be managing the company the way unions tried, and failed, to manage United Airlines, they said. Moreover, Fiat is not Daimler — it is geared toward small, midmarket cars, not fine driving machines with wood-burl dashboards, they added.

Mr. Obama is trying to portray the government’s role as more venture capitalist than manager.

“I’m not an auto engineer,” the president declared Wednesday evening during the news conference marking his 100th day in office. “But I know that if the Japanese can design an affordable, well-designed hybrid, then doggone it, the American people should be able to do the same.”

In fact, in Chrysler’s case, he is relying on Italian technology — Fiat technology — to do what Chrysler has been unable to do itself. And while the White House doesn’t want to advertise that fact as Chrysler embarks on its latest last chance, the plan is for Chrysler to ultimately be a subsidiary of Fiat, in a turnabout of fortune like those in the early days of the auto industry, when giants were consumed by faster-moving competitors.

The plan announced Thursday creates incentives for Fiat to obtain a majority share of its troubled American partner, step by step. Fiat’s stake is supposed to rise in 5 percent increments, if it satisfies each of three milestones: It must expand Chrysler’s market beyond North America by putting Chrysler’s popular Jeeps on car lots in places like Brazil and Italy; it must begin to produce high-performance engines in old Chrysler factories; and it must produce a car that can get 40 miles to the gallon.

The entire venture will be overseen by a new board, including four directors appointed by the president — some of whom, it appears, have already been approached about the job.

Mr. Obama insists that beyond appointing those directors — mostly “experienced C.E.O.’s,” one administration official told The Times — Washington will keep its hands off. But he cautioned that “every dime of new taxpayer money will be repaid before Fiat can take a majority ownership stake.”

That “new money” amounts to about $8 billion in loans, including the cash to pay off Chrysler’s lenders. The federal government has already extended about $4 billion to keep the company afloat in recent months.

The plan faces another potential hitch: that 40-mile-a-gallon car, according to administration officials, probably will not be for sale in the United States until 2012. If the Secret Service can be persuaded, Mr. Obama could tool around in it as he campaigns for re-election.

That means the government, the unions and Fiat must find a way to keep Chrysler afloat for two and a half years, in the worst car market in memory and with offerings that Mr. Obama himself described Thursday at the White House as “less popular, less reliable and less fuel-efficient than foreign competitors’.” Presumably, they will keep that ringing endorsement out of the company’s advertisements.

At General Motors, the events about to unfold are even more complex. While the United States government will hold only about 7 percent of Chrysler’s shares, it will very likely end up with 55 percent of G.M., once the world’s largest carmaker.

And while Mr. Obama says he neither wants to dictate car models nor run the companies, their success or failure will be viewed, rightly or wrongly, as his success or failure as the auto executive he says he never wanted to be.
