North Korea is again threatening to restart its weapons-oriented nuclear program if progress is not made in talks aimed at modernizing its nuclear reactors.

In talks today in New York with officials from the United States, South Korea, Japan and other representatives of an international consortium, North Korea demanded more than $500 million in extras, including building roads, housing and power lines, in addition to the two $2 billion light-water reactors that the consortium has agreed to provide.

We're trying to negotiate an agreement which defines the terms of supplying the light-water reactors and the scope of supply," said Stephen Bosworth, executive director of the consortium, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization.

In an apparent effort to step up the pressure on the United States and other consortium members to meet its demands, a North Korean Foreign Ministry official said on Thursday, "It is self-evident that we cannot continue to unilaterally fulfill our obligation -- a nuclear freeze -- if the U.S. side does not fulfill its obligation concerning the provision of light-water reactors."
