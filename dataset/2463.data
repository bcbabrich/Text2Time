Much of the cellphone system relies on electric power, too. When electricity is interrupted, many switching stations and cellular base stations switch automatically to alternate power sources, either batteries or generators that run on diesel fuel. BellSouth, for instance, has 180 switching stations running on generators.

But most of these sources can supply only 24 to 48 hours of alternate power, which means many stations could shut down soon.

While the worst disruptions are in and around New Orleans, where the most equipment is submerged, coverage is only slowly improving elsewhere in the region. In the hard-hit towns along the Mississippi coast, phone company workers -- not to mention ordinary cellphone users -- are having to trek five miles or more inland to get a signal on their phones.

Cellular companies have been trying to fix this problem by moving "cell sites on wheels" into the area. Verizon, for instance, has 20 of these three-axle trucks, some working in Baton Rouge, La., and some sitting on elevated roadways in New Orleans waiting for a place to go.

As with stationary cellular base stations, though, these "COW's" have to connect to a wider network to complete calls. Some will connect directly to telephone switching equipment. Others will connect using microwave antennas that beam signals to other dishes that are connected to networks.

Many of the New Orleans residents with a 504 area code have been unable to receive calls on their cellphones, even if they have left the region. All cellphones have a home switching office, which keeps billing and service data. When people call a 504 number, the disabled switching stations in New Orleans are unable to route the call.

While voice coverage in New Orleans and other areas hit by the hurricane is sporadic, some cellphone customers have been sending and receiving text messages. These messages get through because, unlike voice calls, they do not need to immediately connect to a user on the other side. Rather, the data packets that form a message are small and will wait until a network is free.
