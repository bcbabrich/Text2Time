"It's going to happen," Fire Commissioner Howard Safir said. "Believe me, it is."

But critics have assailed the Fire Department's plan to take over the city's ambulance service as a flawed, dangerous document. The head of the union for E.M.S. workers calls the plan "a brochure for a billion-dollar budget for the Fire Department," and he says he believes that the City Council does not have the legal right to approve the merger. Several members of the City Council have already raised concerns about aspects of the plan.

For example, they argue that the proposal to buy or lease 60 buildings for neighborhood ambulance stations is impractical. The costs of such acquisitions and construction would far exceed the administration's estimate of roughly $12 million, critics contend, and they say ambulance crews, who answered 1.4 million calls last year, are far too busy to make use of the stations.

"I have questions as to whether the ostensible advantages could be achieved without a merger," said Sheldon S. Leffler, Democrat of Queens, who is chairman of the Public Safety Committee. "I question whether this merger is a vehicle, without saying so, for keeping the Fire Department at its historic work force and budget while other agencies are being cut or eliminated."

The Council hearings on the merger come after months of experimental programs and comparative studies, political positioning and escalating arguments. The administration plan has already produced fighting among unions and lawsuit threats. According to State Health Department officials, the city has not yet filed a formal application to transfer the license to operate ambulances from E.M.S. to the Fire Department.

"The administration has not fully proven their case, that is for sure," said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat who is a Public Safety Committee member.
