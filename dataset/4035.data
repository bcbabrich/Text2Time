TEA BAGS were what drew my attention to Jim Toia used tea bags laid on a shelf at eye level. It was a gag, but one well composed and a lot prettier than anything Duchamp thought up. The time was a few years ago; the scene, a show tried by a jury of one at Montclair State College, now a university.

In the nine years since he emerged a bachelor of fine arts from Bard College, Mr. Toia has had seven exhibitions and participated in numerous group shows. But the Morris Museum here is the first to accord him a solo -- in its recently revived New Jersey Artists Series. For the most part, the work is deployed outside the building, appropriately, for the sculptor's principal medium is dead wood. That is, he uses roots, vines, trunks, branches -- detritus that normally winds up as compost or fuel -- to make art that is easily changed by the elements and will eventually succumb to them.

But the artist is no sentimentalist deferring to nature's every whim. He may admire its creations, but he nonetheless monkeys around with them every chance he gets. The most obvious result of his tampering, and perhaps the most successful, lies in the field beside the museum. What used to be a pine tree 30 feet tall now lies on the grass, a circle of logs tapering from thick to thin. Connected by hinges, they could be arranged in various ways. n their present formation, and with branches reduced to mere prickles, the logs have a certain magic (the kind that comes from Celtic fairies, not a U.F.O. crew).

An occupational hazard for sculptors working with found materials is the temptation to anthropomorphize, and although Mr. Toia resists it, his art abounds in human references. Take ''The Brothers Olaf and Their Siamese Twin Sisters,'' a two-part work reposing on the balcony of the museum's greenhouselike extension. The brothers are represented by a birch sapling with branches at both ends, the twins by a stubby trunk with opposing sets of roots. As Mr. Toia explained in a recent conversation, they are freaks, not found but imperceptibly engineered by him.
