The Rangers are offering CRAIG MacTAVISH a hefty raise to stay with the Stanley Cup champions and pass up a chance to coach in the National Hockey League.

MacTavish, 35, has been offered the coaching job with the Edmonton Oilers, for whom he played before being traded to the Rangers in March. GLEN SATHER would reportedly give up his coaching duties in Edmonton to concentrate on being general manager.

There have been quite a few rumors about him," BRUCE MacGREGOR, executive vice president and assistant general manager of the Oilers, said yesterday about Sather. "There was a rumor here in the paper that NEIL SMITH offered him a two-year deal for $800,000 a year. How many of these rumors are true, I don't know. Craig had a conversation with Glen about being coach. But if he was offered that kind of money, it's doubtful he'll be a coach. I think Glen has an interest.

"At one time in their conversation, Craig indicated that coaching is something he would be interested in when he's done playing. As far as a contract, I don't think they got that far into it."
