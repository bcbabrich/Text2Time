Cameron Hooker, a former mill worker, was convicted today of abducting a young hitchhiker at knifepoint and holding her in bondage for seven years.

Mr. Hooker, 31 years old, could be sentenced for up to 75 years in prison on charges of kidnapping, rape and other sex-related crimes. Judge Clarence Knight set sentencing for Nov. 22.

''Praise the Lord, I'm glad we got justice,'' the 28-year-old victim said when she learned of the verdict. Mr. Hooker's lawyer said his client would appeal the verdict.
