So much reality television; so little that’s real. Phony camaraderie, trumped-up tensions, on-demand tears or shock or jubilation: aren’t there any reality-show everymen or women who can convince us that they’re not merely performing for the cameras? Can’t someone shake us out of our jaded nonbelief?

Yes, someone can: those Alaska gear-grinders, the Ice Road Truckers. Because in the premiere of “IRT: Deadliest Roads,” a spinoff from the “Ice Road Truckers” series, the three veterans of the show who are transported to the hellacious roads of India look downright, positively, not-faking-it scared.

The new series, which makes its debut on Sunday night on History, takes three drivers from the original series — Alex Debogorski, Rick Yemm and Lisa Kelly — to India and has them drive loads of various supplies to places that no human being ought to try to go but apparently quite a few do.

The three drivers are given the local version of a big rig, which is nothing at all like the monster trucks they’re used to driving. For one thing, these trucks have wood frames, which means that any serious collision will reduce them to splinters and leave the driver unprotected. Also, the driver’s seat is on the right.

These coffins on wheels are loaded with cement, which the truckers are supposed to take from Delhi to a dam project in the Himalayas. But it’s a challenge just getting out of Delhi, which, as the narration tells us, is “a city overflowing with 19 million people, just as many animals and every kind of vehicle imaginable.” And, apparently, no traffic regulations.

Traffic lanes? Forget about it. It’s pure bumper cars.

So the truckers are unnerved before they even get to the “deadliest roads” of the title: the ones that go up into the mountains. Their wimpy trucks don’t do well on the steep grades — “This has got five more horsepower than my snowmobile,” Mr. Yemm says at one point — and impatient motorists are speeding past them constantly, usually on blind corners with a killer drop-off on one side.

The truckers look genuinely rattled; Mr. Yemm can’t spew curse words fast enough as he tries to convey his displeasure at the recklessness around him. And the gonzo camera work makes the viewer feel every jamming on of brakes and scrape of fender.

Future episodes will involve more trips up and down these ancient, absurdly narrow roads. It’s invigorating stuff. There’s only so much excitement to be wrung out of driving trucks along the empty roads of Alaska. In this series the Ice Road Truckers learn dramatically that snow, ice and other natural hazards are nothing, compared with the biggest safety hazard of all: too many humans in a hurry to get someplace.
