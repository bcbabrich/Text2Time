Beginning with this post, I’ll occasionally ask chefs in this city — and perhaps, in time, outside this city — the following questions, some serious, some less so. It’s my hope that the answers provide insights into the chefs’ sensibilities and maybe even yield a cooking tip or an idea for a meal.

The first chef to go through the paces: Rebecca Charles of Pearl Oyster Bar in Greenwich Village. Next week: Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park. After that point, the Diner’s Journal Q & A will run about twice a month.

Ms. Charles, 52, opened Pearl in 1997. She had worked before then at the restaurant Arcadia, which closed in 1998. She lives in the West Village just a few blocks from Pearl, which is at 18 Cornelia Street; (212) 691-8211.

Who in your life has influenced your cooking the most?

My mom, and by extension, my grandmother. Anne Rosenzweig influenced me professionally; she helped me to understand the value of personal experience in shaping a chef’s repertoire.

Which book has had the biggest impact?

My mother’s dog-eared copy of “The Gourmet Cookbook,” Volume II, published in 1957.

Which foreign country (or region) do you most enjoy eating in?

You assume I travel frequently. Sadly, I’ve had my head down in a kitchen for 30 years and I’m still in the kitchen at Pearl six days a week. But every couple of months I take a busman’s holiday to Maine to eat lobster.

Which restaurant meal from the past lives most vividly in your memory?

There were two, oddly both in foreign countries.

In 1971, I was in England for the summer. My mom and I were driving around the Lake District one night in teeming rain. We were looking for a place to stay when we stumbled into an information trailer where a kindly gentleman recommended an inn in Ambleside. The place was magical: very English with knick-knacks everywhere, bear rugs and fireplaces roaring in every room. Dinner was already in progress when we sat down and the menu was filled with things I had never seen before. I chose venison stew. It was pretty exotic to a 17 year-old American kid. The food was wheeled in on carts in shining silver hotel service. It was my first foray into eating very different foods and I remember feeling so excited and so grown up.

I think every chef has a memory of some very simple food they ate that at the time seemed like the best thing in the world. For me, it was a roast chicken, in Brussels. While my mother was off looking for a lace shop, I treated myself to lunch alone on the square — roast chicken, frites and a glass of white wine. As I sat in the sun, eating that perfectly cooked chicken with its browned, crisp, salty skin and moist meat, it seemed the single most perfect food I had ever eaten. And the frites!

Which three cooking tools or gadgets are your favorites?

I’m not a big fan of gadgetry in the kitchen.

1.) Tongs. They’re like a prosthesis for the chef. The consummate line cook has them in hand almost continuously. I never understood that French business of turning food over with those fancy thin spatulas and forks. Really busy cooks don’t have the time for such affectations. And they’re also useful for pulling things down from high shelves.

2.) The micro-plane: not just for carpenters anymore.

3.) Food processors — what did we ever do without them?

What’s your favorite music to play in the kitchen?

When I go into work I flip on the iPod, which is filled with an eclectic selection from Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman to Bette Midler, Bill Evans, the Beatles, Jeff Beck, The Band. I don’t listen to music when I cook at home. I watch old movies on TCM. I have a large mirror positioned so that I can see the TV when I work in my kitchen! If I can be watching, for instance, “To Have and Have Not” or “The African Queen,” I am most happy.

Which are the most overrated — and underrated — seasonings?

Overrated: Every year, there’s always some overworked, trendy ingredient or seasoning that chefs catch on to in overwhelming numbers and suddenly it seems it’s on every menu. I avoid these like the plague.

Underrated: salt and pepper. I bore myself silly talking to young cooks about the importance of salt and pepper. I tell them that if you can’t make food taste good using just salt and pepper, don’t even bother graduating to other seasonings.

Is there a guilty secret — something canned, something hokey — in your arsenal of ingredients?

Guilty? Not really. And hardly a secret. It’s pretty widely known that for nine years now I’ve made my bones as a chef in this town on the backs of such great American mass-produced foods as Pepperidge Farm hot dog buns, Hellmann’s mayonnaise, and Thomas’s English muffins.

Is there a rule of conduct or etiquette in your kitchen that you enforce above all others?

A busy kitchen can be like a war zone. Leave your attitude and emotions at the front door.

What’s the most embarrassing thing you’ve ever done in a restaurant kitchen?

I was cooking at the Whistling Oyster in Ogunquit, Maine, circa 1981. One particular Sunday I thought it would be a nice gesture to set up the kitchen for brunch before everyone else got there. We had been out drinking the night before, and I knew everyone would be hung over. We often were in those days. The hot line consisted of 10 burners and a big flat top, which had a huge round stone that needed to be moved aside in order to light this enormous gas jet underneath. I turned the gas on and then went looking for a match but it took longer than I expected. The gas had accumulated under the shelf above the unit, and when I threw the lit match in, there was a blinding flash.

The next thing I knew, I was crawling on my hands and knees to the exit, feeling my way along from one piece of the equipment to another — I couldn’t see. When my friend Mark (now a well-known chef and the owner of Arrows in Ogunquit) came into work, he found me sitting on the back step shaking, saying over and over, “I’m blind! I’m blind!” My vision came back in about 15 minutes, but I had burned all the hair off my eyelashes, eyebrows and the front of my head. For months afterward, everyone called me “burn-head.”

Which item in your home refrigerator would you least like to cop to?

It’s a toss-up between Marie’s Blue Cheese dressing (faux, fast, shamefully easy blue cheese fix) and a box of flax seed some health nut talked me into buying to lower my cholesterol. Try it once and you’ll never go near it again.

Is there a food you can’t bring yourself to like?

I just say no to sea urchin.

What’s the best New York City restaurant that no one talks that much about? (We’ll trust you not to plug a friend.)

With the advent of the Internet there are no secrets anymore. Everybody talks about everything. But Craft and Babbo are my favorite restaurants.

You did something awful and are sentenced to die. Dead Chef Walking! What’s your final meal — and we’re not talking five or six courses, though you can have dessert — before you go?

First course, Beluga on toast. Then a standing prime rib of roast beef, cooked rare to medium rare, with a crispy cap of salted fat and a big slice of Yorkshire pudding swimming in jus. For dessert, warm brandied peaches with vanilla bean ice cream and a piece of my grandmother’s shortbread.
