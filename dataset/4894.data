The National Bank of Poland is devaluing the Polish zloty by 32 percent, Polish media reported today.

The move appeared to be another step aimed at making the currency convertible and improving trade prospects. Until now, the zloty could not be used for international transactions because it is not convertible to other currencies.

Polish radio said Sunday that the new official exchange rate set by the bank will be 9,500 zlotys to $1 as of Monday. On Saturday, the zloty hovered at about 9,000 to $1.

It was the largest devaluation since Parliament approved the non-Communist Government in September. The zloty has been devalued 12 times since then.
