Fred Anderson, a television and radio newsman in Los Angeles for many years, died on June 23 at Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center, where he had undergone triple bypass surgery two days earlier. He had apparently suffered a heart attack the previous weekend, according to KABC-TV. He was 59.

Mr. Anderson had been with KABC-TV since 1969. He specialized in human-interest features in a series titled "Good News," which was broadcast during the 1980's. His work at KABC-TV included a series in which he tried out more than 500 occupations, from teacher and blimp pilot to deckhand and actor.

Mr. Anderson was born in Worcester, Mass. He studied music, but decided on a career in journalism. He worked for United Press International in Roanoke, Va., where he also worked as a radio reporter and news director. He was a radio news director at WJBW in New Orleans before moving to Los Angeles. His awards included an Emmy for a documentary on battered children.

He is survived by his parents, Fred and Edna, of Tampa, Fla.; a sister, Elaine Moore of Raleigh, N.C.; a brother, Calvin, of Massachusetts, and three daughters.
