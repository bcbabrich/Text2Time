As they move from the traditions of totalitarianism to open government, politicians in Russia and the other republics might take note of two essential elements of late 20th-century American bureaucracy: the doctrine of plausible deniability and its indispensable accessory, the shredder. Both were conspicuously absent in the failed Soviet coup.

Soviet officials who might have come to Mr. Gorbachev's aid but didn't fell back on the ridiculous "coup flu" excuse. They produced no backdated memos, claimed no memory loss and found not a single subordinate to blame.

The Kremlin plotters, meanwhile, devoted even less thought to covering their tracks. Instead, they held a press conference to declare their treason and left a paper trail of signed decrees so blatantly criminal that any self-respecting Washington secretary would deep-six them without a second thought.

And that raises the second point. Apparently, the K.G.B. relies not on document shredders but ancient, subterranean furnaces. This system has major flaws. It leads to releases of smoke that contribute unacceptably to urban smog, and it tends to alert the public that an obstruction of justice is under way.
