PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 28 - The problem with Jos√© Reyes is usually that he cannot run enough. The problem on Monday was that he tried to run too much.

During the first intrasquad game of spring training, Reyes was picked off twice at Tradition Field. That left the Mets to wonder if Reyes, their starting shortstop and projected leadoff hitter, is almost feeling too healthy.

"He was like a young colt getting out of the stable," Manager Willie Randolph said. "He was anxious, jumpy. I got a chuckle out of it. I looked over at one point and said, 'Where are you going?"'

Reyes was understandably giddy, considering that he has sustained seven leg injuries in the past two years, missed the first two and a half months of last season with a recurring hamstring pull, then fractured his left fibula in August. After a pain-free winter, he was eager to show the newfound spring in his legs.
