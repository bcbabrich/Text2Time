On Super Tuesday, as in New Hampshire a few weeks ago, Donald Trump basically has the devil’s luck.

In the days before Tuesday’s slew of primaries, there were signs that Trump might be pulling away, expanding his support beyond the rough one-third of the party that’s backed him since last summer. One poll had him at 49 percent nationally, another at 40 percent in Virginia, another close to Ted Cruz in Texas. There was the Chris Christie endorsement, the Jeff Sessions endorsement — and yes, the K.K.K. business, but the “Trump Is Inevitable” drumbeat on cable news and Twitter sometimes seemed to drown that controversy out.

But in the end, Trump’s numbers were impressive but not at all a race ender. The states in play were mostly up and down what you might call the Trump Belt — the swath of America, extending from the Deep South up through Appalachia and into New England, where his unusual coalition is strongest. Yet he won less than half the night’s delegates, with vote totals still in the 35 percent range — peaking in Massachusetts and Alabama (an amazing combination), but falling into the 20s outside the Trump Belt (in Oklahoma, Texas, Minnesota) and holding in the 30s elsewhere.

For a candidate who is not only opposed but feared as a race-baiting demagogue by almost the entire party establishment, who looks less electable than any of his rivals in the fall, who has prominent conservatives (including, this week, a sitting United States senator) lining up to swear they’ll never vote for him, who is basically in undeclared war with the last Republican president and the last two party nominees — for such a candidate, 35 percent of the vote still does not seem like it should be enough to win through to the nomination.

Yet the Super Tuesday results did nothing, nothing, to clarify who exactly might win it instead. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are locked in a bizarre standoff, where each one has an entirely plausible claim to be the not-Trump candidate, and neither has a clear reason to depart the race.
