The woman, who said the initials C. J. are not her own, said she felt no remorse. "I blame it on men, period," she said, adding, "I'm doing it to all the men because it was a man that gave it to me."

During the interview, Mr. Johnson repeatedly urged the woman to seek counseling. She continues to call him, he said Thursday. Once she told him she contracted the AIDS virus from a white bisexual man, he said. He said he arranged for her to talk with a minister, but "I don't think we have made a lot of headway with her."

Some people who call Mr. Johnson argue that C. J.'s story is a hoax.

Charles O'Neal, publisher of The Dallas Examiner, a weekly newspaper whose readership is largely black, said that though no one can be sure whether it is a hoax he believes that the story has stirred intense public discussion among blacks about heterosexual AIDS transmission. "I am certain there is some communitywide consternation that C. J. is one of a number of people who are out there wreaking havoc with this disease," he said.

Health officials said the number of heterosexual men seeking information about AIDS has greatly increased in recent weeks in Dallas County.

"In the past, people seemed to be a lot more judgmental about people who get this disease," said Phillip Mathews, director of minority services at the AIDS Interfaith Network. "Now they are showing serious concern because it could hit very close to home. C. J. could be a blessing, in a sad sort of way."

At R. J.'s on the Lake, a fashionable disco on Dallas's northwest side, the manager, Jerry Sanders, said business was as brisk as ever but "people's attitudes about high-risk behavior have changed enormously, thanks to C. J." Drop in Promiscuity

Many of those at the bar agreed. "If what this woman says is true, we are talking about a form of genocide," said Levi Peterson 3d, a 32-year-old accountant. "It is serial killing. But true or not, promiscuity has de-elevated, believe me."
