Members of the Board of Es timate charged yesterday that Mayor Lindsay had “deceived” and “fooled” them in urging the razing of a Corona, Queens, neighborhood for a high school three weeks ago and then sud denly reversing the plan to as sume the role of a “hero.”

Sanford D. Garelik, President of the City Council and a board member, said that a delay had been requested Nov. 13 by some board members to look into al ternatives before taking up the final formality in the four‐year long controversy, closing off two streets. Mr. Garelik said administration officials had in sisted that no alternative plans could be considered and that the cost of previous delays had reached $9‐million.

But late Tuesday, Mr. Lind say announced a compromise proposal in which the school would be built with a smaller athletic field that would permit 31 Corona homes to be spared and 28 others to be moved to new foundations only a block away.

Mr. Garelik and other board members who gathered in thel City Hall rotunda with news men yesterday said they were outraged because they had voted for the closing with great reluctance on the basis of the administration's recommenda tion.
