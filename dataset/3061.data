EXACTLY 125 years ago next month, Alexander Graham Bell said into the very first telephone, ''Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.'' Nobody remembers what the inventor of the first cordless phone said, but it was probably, ''Hey, has anyone seen the handset?''

There's no disputing that cordless phones offer a degree of freedom lacking in curly-cord phones; for one thing, a cordless phone ends the noisy humiliation of dragging your telephone off the desk while reaching for a pencil. Unfortunately, when a cordless conversation ends, so does the freedom -- sooner or later you must return the phone to its base station, which is tethered to a phone jack. As a result, typical cordless phones are really only slightly less tied down than corded ones.

But a new era of phone freedom has dawned, thanks to a new breed of phone: the multihandset cordless. These systems let you park the base station anywhere in your home or small office, even someplace inaccessible. Then you can strategically position as many cordless handsets as you need -- up to eight or nine -- all over the premises. The tiny recharging stand that comes with each handset requires a power outlet but no phone line, freeing you to stash phones into oddball corners that aren't anywhere near phone jacks.

That freedom of placement, however, is only the first joy of multihandset phones; another huge advantage is their corporate-style communications features. For example, you can make intercom-style calls from handset to handset without tying up the phone line. You can transfer a call you've just answered to the base or to another handset without having to cover the mouthpiece and yell, ''It's for you!'' And most let you check for messages on the base station's answering machine from any handset in the house, conserving precious muscle energy.
