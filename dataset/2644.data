Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students brainstorm questions they would like the presidential candidates to answer during the debates and consider questions created by experts. They then review portions of debate transcripts and analyze the candidates’ responses to particular questions, and then write reaction papers about the candidates’ performances and the debate’s role in the campaign.

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Brainstorm questions they would like to see the candidates answer during a presidential debate.

2. Consider dream questions from writers, scholars and politicians by reading and discussing “What to Ask John Kerry and George Bush.”

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “What to Ask John Kerry and George Bush” //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041001friday.html (one per student)

-copies of transcripts from the 2004 presidential election, found online at //www.nytimes.com/2004/10/01/politics/campaign/01dtext.html (isolating each question and corresponding answers; one per student pair)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class: “What questions would you like to see presidential candidates John Kerry and George W. Bush answer during the political debates leading up to the 2004 election?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers and make a list of their questions on the blackboard. Ask students to consider not only the content of the questions, but also their form. What makes a good question? What types of words or phrasing should be used? What words or phrases should be avoided?

2. As a class, read and discuss “What to Ask John Kerry and George Bush” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041001friday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. Who is William Kristol?

b. According to Mr. Kristol, how long does John Kerry realistically think it will take to get all American troops home from Iraq?

c. Where is the “second African genocide” taking place?

d. Who is Ruth Wedgwood?

e. What concern does Ms. Wedgwood have regarding Mr. Kerry’s statements regarding the International Criminal Court?

f. What was bombed in 1998?

g. What obstacle prevented Saddam Hussein from instating a long-range missile project?

h. Who is Victor Davis Hanson?

i. What Middle Eastern countries is Mr. Hanson asking Mr. Kerry about?

j. What did President Bush do to Yasir Arafat?

k. Who is Madeleine K. Albright?

l. What concern does Ms. Albright voice by pointing out troubles the United States is facing in Iraq?

m. What obstacles do the Iraqi people face regarding their January elections?

n. Why is the Korean Peninsula, particularly North Korea, considered a threat to the United States and the world?

o. Who is Richard A. Clarke?

p. After the U.S. presidential election, what plan does Mr. Bush have to regain control in Iraq?

q. How might Iran be a threat to the United States and world peace?

r. What happened in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, 2004?

s. Who is Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.?

t. What point is Mr. Schlesinger trying to make about religion and war in his question to Mr. Bush about Christian values?

3. Divide students into pairs. Explain to students that they will be examining parts of the transcript from the first presidential debate between John Kerry and George W. Bush to discover how well they answered the actual questions they were asked. Assign each pair a question and its complete answer from the transcripts. (Note: The debate format consisted of a question being posed by moderator Jim Lehrer to one or the other candidate, followed by a two-minute response and then a 90-second rebuttal, as well as an optional extension.) Provide them with a copy of the text they have been assigned. (Complete transcripts of the debate can be found at //www.nytimes.com/2004/10/01/politics/campaign/01dtext.html.) Students will be writing reaction papers examining the performance of the two candidates on a single question-analyzing how each one answered the same question and comparing their performances–and the impact the debate may have on the outcome of the election.

To analyze their assigned question and answer, instruct each pair to work together to complete the following sentence starters (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):

“INSTRUCTIONS

After reading a question and both candidates’ answers, complete the following sentences:

-The question is …

-On a scale of one to 10, one being the least direct and 10 being the most direct, the candidate answered the question …

-What the candidate said about the topic is …

-What the candidate said that was not about the topic is …

-The candidate used rhetorical strategies (repetition, analogy, pauses in speech, etc.) such as …

-The candidate did not mention …(which was pertinent to answering the question)

-What I don’t understand about the candidate’s answer is …

-The questions I still have for this candidate about this topic are …

-What I would have liked the candidate to have talked about is …”

Once pairs have completed their analysis, they share their questions and analysis of the answers with the class to compare their opinions.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students write a reaction paper based on their in-depth analysis of the transcripts. What do you think of the way Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry answered their questions? What was the purpose of the debate? Was this purpose met? Is this the type of event people should watch and use to make their voting decisions? Why or why not? Did this activity affect your own views about the candidates and the election? If so, how?

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Should political debates be highly regulated and orchestrated? Why or why not?

-Why are political debates viewed as important events in an election?

-Does watching presidential debates help undecided voters make up their minds?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions, thoughtful analysis of the assigned portion of the presidential debate transcripts, and thoughtfully written reaction papers.

Extension Activities:

1. Read the entire transcript of the debate or watch a videotape of the debate. Then write a letter to one of the candidates critiquing his performance. What recommendations can you make to this candidate for the next debate to make his rhetoric more effective?

2. Read the book “No Debate: How the Two Major Parties Secretly Ruin the Presidential Debates” by George Farah, and write a book review focusing on the question “How democratic is the political debate process?”

3. Create a poster examining the role public debate–in all forms–plays in a democracy.

4. Stage a debate on a topic important to your peers, school or community.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History – Create a timeline on the history of the presidential debates. When did they begin? Under what circumstances? What organizations were involved with planning and facilitating them? Mark moments that have been considered to be notable and decisive throughout presidential debate history.

Global History – Write a paper examining one of the countries or historical events mentioned in the questions asked in “What to Ask John Kerry and George Bush.” Countries include Germany, Lebanon, Syria, North Korea, Libya, the Sudan, and others. Events include African genocide (Rwanda or Sudan), bombings of American embassies in East Africa, missile strikes against Osama Bin Laden’s training camps, foreign policy with Libya, etc. How did this event affect world affairs?

Media Studies – The first televised presidential debate was held on September 26, 1960, between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy. Create an oral report examining the role of television in the debate process.

Science – Create a “How It Works” poster illustrating the physical phenomenon of speech. What organs, muscles and nerves are used? How do we speak? What role does the brain play?

Teaching with The Times – Compile articles analyzing the debates conducted for the 2004 presidential election (three debates between the presidential candidates and one between the vice-presidential candidates). Keep a running list of critiques about each candidate made by journalists and by citizens quotes in various articles, and how the critiques change or remain steady over the course of the debates. Write a brief reaction explaining your findings.
