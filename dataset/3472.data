At last Thursday's performance of the Missa Solemnis at Avery Fisher Hall, Kurt Masur had all the virtuosity he needed. The New York Philharmonic gleamed; the New York Choral Artists and the American Boychoir knocked down one scary passage after another. It was very impressive and almost too easy. This is not easy music.

Why did Beethoven make things so hard for the rest of us? Mozart and Liszt wrote music that likes to be played, though both are difficult in their separate ways. One explanation says that Beethoven was mad (which he must have been). Another is that he didn't care (he said as much, famously, to a complaining violinist about another piece): Beethoven wanted an effect, and it was up to the performer to realize it.

Another answer is that deafness had so isolated him from the tactile and practical world of performing that the concerns of the musician became remote from his thoughts. Composers in fact often hear their music faster than performers do, probably because for them the connection of thought to sound is direct, without the middlemen that the listener requires: no violins to scrape, pianos to pound or high notes to attack. A machine on the drawing board runs unimpeded. In motion, friction comes into play. It slows things down.

This might be why the metronome speeds that Beethoven later attached to his pieces seem fast to us, so fast that the composer's metronome has been accused of malfunction. Or are these tempos what he really wanted? The better we get at playing the string quartets, for example, the more quartet players argue for the latter, but we won't ever really know.

The more paranoid among us say that Beethoven knew precisely what he was doing and that fear and physical strain were calculated parts of the musical message. It happens elsewhere in his later music, one example being the finale of the ''Hammerklavier'' Piano Sonata, written five years earlier than the Missa Solemnis. So great is the effort to negotiate this monster of a movement that palpable effort, even among well-developed piano virtuosos, becomes part of the musical experience.
