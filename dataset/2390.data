An appeals court extended the prison sentence of André Tarallo, one of the main defendants in the 2003 embezzlement trial of executives at the oil group Elf Aquitaine to seven years, from four. Prosecutors had appealed the original sentence for Mr. Tarallo, 77, as too lenient. There were two other main defendants: Elf's former chairman, Loïk Le Floch-Prigent, is free after serving part of a five-year term, and his No.2, Alfred Sirven, died in February. John Tagliabue (NYT)
