Dr. Stuart M. Berger, an author of best-selling diet and health books, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40.

A spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner's office, Ellen Borakove, said that an autopsy had been performed but that the cause of death had not yet been determined.

Dr. Berger, a health advice columnist for The New York Post since 1984, wrote several books in which he advocated healing and dieting techniques based on nutrition and improving the strength of the body's immune system. He also contended that his programs would result in increased longevity and promised a long life to patients who followed his advice.

"Dr. Berger's Immune Power Diet" (NAL Books, 1985), a No. 1 best-seller in the advice category, described how Dr. Berger, who was 6 feet 7 1/2 inches tall, reduced his weight to 210 pounds from 420.
