For military families around the nation, the worst fears of months of waiting came true today with the first reports of casualties in the ground war in the Persian Gulf.

Wives and mothers, children and parents who had been searching the television news for the faces of their relatives now waited at home, hoping they would not hear that their men were among the 11 marines killed in fighting near Khafji, Saudi Arabia.

Wherever they came from, all the marines reported killed were local boys here in Oceanside, home to 18,000 marines at Camp Pendleton, the huge Marine base that dominates this San Diego suburb of 128,000 people -- a city decorated with yellow ribbons, flags and placards supporting the troops.

"Unfortunately," said Linda Seymour, whose husband is a Marine sergeant and who founded a support group for military families here, "the best the wives can do now is just kind of wait for that telephone not to ring or for that military car not to appear in front of their homes."
