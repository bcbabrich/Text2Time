A medical team's fight to save the life of a Vietnamese-American student dying of leukemia in California has become mired in Vietnamese bureaucracy, a New York physician said here today.

The story of the 20-year-old immigrant, whose name has not been made public by his father, illustrates the kind of problem Vietnamese officials themselves say they have with layers of decision making that must be streamlined if the country is to develop.

The young man in California is in urgent need of a bone marrow transplant, according to Dr. Arnold Schecter, a professor of preventive medicine at the State University of New York at Binghamton.

Dr. Schecter, who has been conducting joint research on dioxins with Vietnamese scientists, was asked to help Dr. Ann von Gehr of the Permanente Medical Group in San Jose, Calif., find the student's mother and five sisters in Vietnam and collect a blood sample for compatibility testing. The leukemia victim's father and one brother are with him in the United States, but have not proved to be suitable donors.
