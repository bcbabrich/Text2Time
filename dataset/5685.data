''THE LIVING PLANET: A Portrait of the Earth,'' the much acclaimed series from Britain, arrives on public television Sunday night. In it, David Attenborough looks at the world, and finds it inviting. In the first of 12 episodes, he shows us how the earth was formed, how continents moved, and how flora and fauna proliferated. We have seen this on television before, of course, but Mr. Attenborough's series is special. For one thing, it looks spectacular; for another, there is Mr. Attenborough, blessed with a quirky charm. The first episode, ''The Building of the Earth,'' will be seen on Channel 13 at 7 P.M.

Thus we begin in the Himalayas, in the ''deepest valley in the world.'' Mr. Attenborough is our guide, a job he takes seriously. We may not smell the rhododendrons in the valley, but certainly we know they're there. Mr. Attenborough, trudging through the valley, is interested in everything: flowers, monkeys, trees, pheasants with ''the burnished metallic iridescence of tropical butterflies,'' Sherpas plowing with yaks.

At the same time, it's the big picture he's after. How did these wonders come about? Mr. Attenborough stands on a hilltop, panting heavily. The thin air and the hike have gotten to him. We're concerned that he's all done in. Not to worry, however; soon he is showing us a fossilized shell. He says it is a sign that the Himalayas were once under the sea.

Cut then to a great wall of flame. ''I'm in Iceland now,'' Mr. Attenborough says. He is standing in front of a volcano, and wind is ruffling his hair. Much of ''The Living Planet'' is full of transitions like that. We are on one continent and then another. Sometimes Mr. Attenborough follows; other times we just hear his voice. From Iceland, we go to Ireland, and then to the Hebrides. We hear Mr. Attenborough all the while, although we don't see him again until Krakatoa.
