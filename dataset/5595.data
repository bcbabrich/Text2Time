Conflicts between American Indians and the Federal Government are nothing new, but the contest that once raged on Western battlefields has now moved to the bingo parlor and, most recently, to Congress as well.

Encouraged by the Reagan Administration, Indian tribes in several states have established high-stakes bingo parlors, which, because they are on land held in trust for the Indian nations by the Government, are exempt from many state regulations.

According to Carl F. Shaw, a spokesman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Administration has supported the bingo operations because they fit in with President Reagan's desire to see Indian tribes become more self-sufficient as Federal money becomes less plentiful. Objections by the States

But many states say the bingo parlors are driving rival fund-raising operations run by church groups and veterans' organizations out of business by offering higher stakes than state regulations would allow. Others complain that those stakes, which can exceed $100,000, will draw organized crime into the tribes' affairs. And some say they fear that the tribes will eventually get into casinos, horse racing, lotteries and other such high-stakes gambling operations.
