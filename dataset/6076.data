There is still a mystery about the killer's motivation, Chief Keenan said. But from the latest incident, “What may be significant are the articles of clothing,” the detective commander added, appealing for descriptions to be widely publicized.

So far the gunman has apparently fired not more than four bullets in any incident from his five‐round Charter Arms Bulldog .44 caliber revolver. Experts said he could be keeping a last .bullet, but more likely was leaving empty the chamber under the firing pin—a safety measure to prevent the gun's going off accidentally from any sudden jar or forward push while being carried.

He has been pictured as firing twohanded from a crouch—a technique taught to the police and some other lawenforcement agents. This is to aid accuracy, but al so to cope with a heavy recoil from the .44 caliber weapon, which has a large bullet with slow velocity that tends to keep it within a victim's body.

The so‐called “Son of Sam” appears to be a skilled marksman, hitting his victims at night when it is difficult to use the revolver's sights.

In tracking the 28,000 Bulldog revolvers manufactured by the Charter Arms Corporation of Bridgeport, Conn., Deputy Police Commissioner Francis J. McLoughlin said “three or four dozen” members of the Police Department and suburban forces had been found to own them. But investigators have cleared those of any involvement, he said.

The police task force has also cleared a dozen people who had seemed to be the most likely suspects, Chief Keenan said. They were kept under surveillance over the weekend. Asked at his news conference yesterday whether this was a setback for the task force, Chief Keenan said:

“No, that is a help to us. We no longer have to worry about them.”

Both Miss Moskowitz and Mr. Violante were shot in the head. Neurosurgeons worked for eight hours trying to save Miss Moskowitz's life Sunday morning and afternoon, removing part of her brain, and renewed surgery during the night in efforts to reduce swelling of the brain.

“Everything known to neurosurgeons has been done in an attempt to save her,” Ira C. Clark, executive director of Kings County Hospital Center, said yesterday morning. At 4:15 P.M., Dr. Shuchart told newsmen “the only thing that is working is her heart, and that has stopped a number of times, at least half a dozen times.”
