BOGOT√Å, Colombia, July 31 - When a new law governing the demobilization of Colombia's main paramilitary coalition was approved in June, victims' rights organizations and some American congressmen strongly objected, saying the legislation would be too soft on the group, which is blacklisted by the State Department as a terrorist organization.

Now, a new study by the advocacy group Human Rights Watch magnifies those concerns. Basing research on interviews with disarmed fighters and high Colombian authorities, the report details what it calls serious flaws in the demobilization process, which is now governed by the Justice and Peace law.

Most glaring, the report says, is that members of the paramilitary coalition, the United Self-Defense Forces, representing 15,000 fighters, are not being asked for specific information as they disarm, further cloaking the atrocities attributable to their groups or the finances and other inner workings of the organizations.

The rights group also says that those who disarm are not closely monitored to ensure they are not still committing crimes.
