Jay Leno returned to “The Tonight Show” on Monday with a throwback to “The Wizard of Oz” — and maybe also to “Dallas.”

In what is known as a “cold opening” — a scene before the show runs its opening credits — Mr. Leno was shown waking up in bed à la Dorothy, surrounded by his friends on the show — Kevin Eubanks, Ross the Intern and John Melendez (who has lost his job as announcer).

The idea was that Jay had been away in a place where some things were wonderful and some were “not so nice,” as he put it.

Of course, Mr. Leno was coming back to reoccupy the “Tonight” host chair recently vacated by Conan O’Brien, following NBC‘s retreat from its original plan for late night this season in which Mr. Leno shifted to prime time. When that didn’t work, the network decided to give Mr. Leno the 11:35 p.m. time slot back and part ways with Mr. O’Brien. Mr. Leno did not mention Mr. O’Brien in his dream sequence opening.

Later he opened his monologue with the line, “It’s good to be home,” before adding, “I’m Jay Leno, your host … at least for a while.”

Referencing the Super Bowl commercial in which he appeared with his rival David Letterman (and Oprah Winfrey), Mr. Leno said, “I’ve got to admit I’m a little nervous. Not because it’s my first night back. Because I know that Dave and Oprah are watching.”

Mr. Letterman, on CBS, delivered only a couple of lines on Mr. Leno’s return:

“Thank you very much, welcome to the ‘Late Show,’ my name is Dave Letterman — same time, same host.” “I want to tell you something, tonight is a rough night for my mom. She doesn’t know who to watch — Jimmy Kimmel or Jay.”

Mr. Letterman also joked about Gov. David A. Paterson‘s problems, saying that Mr. Paterson had announced he would not run for election, but that “Jay had nothing to do with it.”

Mr. Leno’s studio looked much the same as it had been on his prime time show, though he followed his monologue with a segment in which he searched for a desk. He had not sat behind a desk in prime time, which was widely noticed and criticized.
