"Halloween is not really remembered for religious associations, and that makes it available for wider celebration," said Leigh Eric Schmidt, a professor of religion at Princeton University and author of a recent book, "Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays."

In addition, Mr. Schmidt said: "There's this attempt to create an American calendar out of a hodgepodge of traditions. There's this desire to create national traditions -- this hope and vision of unity. It's a deep national impulse."

In the case of Halloween, it has bred some unwanted consequences. School administrators in New York City said that many junior high and high school students treat the day as a de facto holiday, in some cases because they fear the pranks of peers and in others because they plan pranks of their own, and that attendance dips discernibly each Halloween.

School officials said they do not have precise statistics from past years and do not know how many children stayed out of school yesterday. But in a sign of concern, Francine Goldstein, the director of the Board of Education's Division of Student Support Services, sent letters to principals last week reminding them that Halloween is not a school holiday.

But in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, groups of high school students gathered in Marine Park yesterday during school hours to dig large trenches in which they hoarded crates of eggs to throw at passing cars. In one group, the boys were dressed in elaborate coveralls of rain gear, hockey masks and asbestos-removal uniforms as a defense from others throwing eggs at them.

Some schools around the country, particularly in the South, have abandoned Halloween decorations and discussions in deference to conservative Christian parents, who have voiced concern that the holiday promotes satanism.

But some experts said that the whiff of controversy is much more a sign that Halloween has truly arrived than a signal that Halloween is on the way out.
