The boom in the high-yield debt markets has bought time and breathing space for companies needing extra financial flexibility. But that has come at a cost, according to the latest annual report by Moody’s Investors Service: more than $700 billion will come due between 2012 and 2014.

Thanks to both the earlier buyout boom, born of an unprecedented wave of cheap credit, and the recent reopening of the financial markets, companies with speculative-grade paper will find themselves in need of refinancing or repayment in a few years. Whether the improvement in the economy and the rediscovered appetite for risk will head off another disaster remains to be seen, Moody’s analysts caution.

“If everything behaves normally and you have an efficient market, things should be OK,” Kevin Cassidy, a senior credit officer at Moody’s, told DealBook on Monday. “But that’s a big if.”

With the onset of the credit crunch in 2008, restructuring professionals — the bankers, lawyers and consultants who shepherd clients through reorganizations or bankruptcy filings — found themselves busier than they had been in years. While the number of filings declined later last year, these advisers cautioned that a wall of coming maturities could make increase their workloads yet again.

According to Moody’s, roughly 995 of 1,300 issuers have debt that matures between this year and 2014. The coming crush of maturities won’t materialize this year, with Moody’s calculating about $21 billion in high-yield debt maturing this year. But in 2014, that number swells to $338 billion in loans and bonds coming due.

The story of the explosion in cheap lending during the credit boom is well known at this point, and that bubble’s popping has already led to big bankruptcy filings and bracing debt reorganizations. Of the top ten issuers with debt maturities coming due between 2010 and 2014, several are tied to boom-era buyouts, including a subsidiary of the utility player TXU (now known as Energy Future Holdings); the hospital operator HCA; the data services provider First Data; and the chip maker Frescale Semiconductor.

But 2009 also saw a wave of high-yield debt offerings as well, some $145 billion in new junk bond issuances. Over all, speculative-grade companies raised about $200 billion in new debt for the year.

What’s especially notable is that about 78 percent of that debt was for refinancing existing obligations, Moody’s points out. While those loans and, increasingly, bonds has postponed the day of reckoning for companies, it does nothing to relieve their overall debt loads.

“Despite significant spread-tightening in the credit markets, there remain only limited options for rolling over this debt,” Peter Fitzsimmons, the North America president for the consulting firm AlixPartners, said in a press release last week. “Therefore, the potential for a very serious cash crunch could be knocking on the door of Corporate America.”

The Moody’s report also raises another concern. With so much of the recent issuances taken up by refinancings, it’s not clear how much appetite the high-yield market may have for debt meant for other purposes, notably mergers and acquisitions. Deal-makers have predicted that their business will pick up again as the financing markets again become receptive to new offerings.

If the overall market for debt grows, that won’t be much of a problem. But with banks still largely filled to near-capacity for lending and the hunger among bond investors unknown at this point, it’s not clear whether M.&A. will rise to the hoped-for frothier levels anytime soon.
