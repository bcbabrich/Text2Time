TUESDAY PUZZLE — Look! Up in the SKY! It’s a FLOCK OF BIRDS! It’s a PLANE! It’s Paul MOLITOR, whom I did not know before today’s puzzle by Peter A. Collins. But apparently, Mr. MOLITOR can fly, because he’s up there above the HORIZON.

Today we have a crossword with a visual element, which is the HORIZON stretching across the middle of our grid, and the “blue expanse” SKY and the “blue expanse” SEA above and below. Some of the contents of the SKY and the SEA can be seen in their appropriate places in the grid. (We won’t talk about the placement of Amelia EARHART at 41 Down. Mr. Collins explains that in his notes below.)

Two theme entries that are relatively common phrases — FLOCK OF BIRDS and SCHOOL OF FISH — make their New York Times debuts today, a fact that surprised me. Wouldn’t you think they would have appeared at least once in this crossword? When I first solved the puzzle, I felt like I had seen this theme before, but Mr. Collins’s take on it seems to be unique.

Mr. Collins talks about the nontheme fill in his notes below, and I agree with him that there seems to have been quite a few three-letter words in addition to less desirable fill and abbreviation. Still, I appreciated the CHEX Mix offering and the fact that it was above the HORIZON, because who likes soggy snacks?

Let’s hear from our constructor:

Constructor’s Notes:

Into which category does the theme of this one fall? There is no wordplay in the usual crossword sense – it’s the location of the themed entries that gives them relevance. Is there a name for this kind of puzzle? The theme has quite a lot of three-letter answers (25), which was necessitated, to a large extent, by HORIZON and its neighboring black squares in the center of the grid (forming a visual “horizon,” I hope). Will and Joel asked me to rework the grid to try to lower the three-letter word count, which I did. However, in the end they thought the fill in this original version was significantly superior — enough to counterbalance the short-answer overload. When first constructing the puzzle, I tried to include additional themed material — CLOUD and SHARK in the top and bottom rows where BRAWL and RATTY are — but that’s when the fill really started to groan. I’m happy to introduce NO CUTS today. I don’t know about you, but the phrase always immediately transports me back to waiting in the lunch line at my junior high. Ahh, I can practically feel the wedgies and the noogies … And, honestly, I didn’t intend for poor Amelia EARHART to end up nose-down in the SEA. In fact, it didn’t dawn on me until well after I’d finished constructing the puzzle. Yikes! But I decided to leave her there. What? Too soon? At least she took a HIPSTER down with her.

One of the things I love about the Internet — there’s a lot to feel ambivalent about — is the fact that we can experience things outside our own backyards and before our time. Let’s move on to our Wednesday puzzle with some Edith Piaf, in a live performance from 1954:
