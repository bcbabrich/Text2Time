To the Editor:

What Paul Krugman says is true: the Social Security system is a pay-as-you-go system and therefore will never offer workers returns as good as they could get outside the system (column, May 31). And George W. Bush's proposal is short on many salient details.

But what Mr. Krugman misses is that the current system is fundamentally (and fatally) flawed in that citizens own nothing. Mr. Bush's plan is a politically palatable first step toward citizens' actually owning something and therefore controlling their own destinies, rather than an all-powerful government's controlling everything. It truly represents a shifting of power to the people.
