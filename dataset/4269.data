Yet with half the season remaining, the Knicks have the same record as Houston and they are just one game behind Seattle. And the SuperSonics have a lot to think about after being manhandled on their home floor Saturday by the Knicks, 106-92.

Last season, the Knicks were only 26-15 through 41 games, before rolling to a 34-7 record in the second half of the season. One of New York's goals this season is to finish with the National Basketball Association's best record. The Knicks face the most difficult part of their schedule during the next five weeks, but by winning 10 of their last 12 games, they appear poised for a strong second half.

"Yes, I'm pleased with where we are," said Coach Pat Riley. "At one time this season, we only had six players healthy enough to practice. We've managed to keep our heads above water. There's every reason to believe that our best basketball is ahead of us." Harper Fitting In

Several signs indicate that Riley may be correct. Anthony Mason, plagued by nagging injuries all season, finished the West Coast trip with two strong games. Smith has been more assertive since returning six games ago. Not only has Smith attacked the basket aggressively, but he has added a 3-point jumper to his arsenal. His offensive ability and 6-foot-10-inch size force most teams to double-team him, which creates openings for other players.

Derek Harper has begun to feel comfortable in the Knicks' offense. He went through the same process that most players who are traded go through. He hesitated to shoot and he was tentative because he was not familiar with the offense. But on Sunday, Harper played his best game since being traded to the Knicks by the Mavericks on Jan. 6. Harper scored 22 points on 7-for-10 shooting, giving New York a new outside threat at the point-guard position. Riley said he hoped to create more options in the offense for Harper as the coach became more familiar with Harper's game.
