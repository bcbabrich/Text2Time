Challenging Orthodoxies

In an Evening of Beethoven

Orchestra of St. Luke

Carnegie Hall

It takes a combination of conviction and fortitude to offer an all-Beethoven concert at a time when programs devoted wholly to standard repertory are increasingly criticized as unimaginative. Andre Previn tilted at that windmill on Wednesday when he led the Orchestra of St. Luke's in a Beethoven evening. He also challenged another orthodoxy, the belief that a composer's instrumentation and sense of scale are sacrosanct. His centerpiece was a string orchestra expansion of the String Quartet No. 14, with basses doubling the cello line and with dynamics and tempos that reflected the ensemble's heft.

Tradeoffs were inevitable. A composer writing for a string quartet expects a nimbleness and clarity that it would not be reasonable to expect from an orchestra, not only because the move from single to multiple strings courts ensemble problems, but also because of the different ways a quartet and an orchestra interact with an acoustic space. The Orchestra of St. Luke's played with extroardinary unity, yet there were times, particularly in the Presto, when a listener craved the sharper focus a quartet affords.

Still, it was not lost on Mr. Previn that Beethoven's slow movements magnify well, and in the Adagio and Andante movements, he drew from his players a Stokowskian lushness and grandeur. Earlier, Mr. Previn was more circumspect. Except for its punctuating chordal bursts, his account of the ''Coriolan'' Overture subordinated drama and electricity to surface sheen. In the Fourth Piano Concerto, Mr. Previn and his soloist, Horacio Gutierrez, presented a refined, patrician reading that worked magnificently in the slow movement, but elsewhere lacked the provocative edge that makes Beethoven Beethoven.
