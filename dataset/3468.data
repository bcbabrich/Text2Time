In one bold stroke, Tennessee converted its Medicaid health benefits to managed care five years ago and used the savings to cover hundreds of thousands of people who could not afford health insurance of their own or were too sick to qualify. With three million people enrolled, the program, called Tenncare, became the most ambitious and generous government health plan in the nation.

But with Tenncare's costs rising and Tennessee facing a budget deficit, the program is under fire and facing probable retrenchment under pressure from Gov. Don Sundquist. And the people most at risk are those who benefit most from the state's effort at providing nearly universal health insurance: those with chronic or even terminal diseases who have been rejected by private insurance.

To arrest a projected 12 percent increase in Tenncare spending for the year beginning in July, Governor Sundquist, a Republican elected to a second four-year term in November, has proposed a moratorium on new enrollments of those regarded as uninsurable, for six months or a year, while the state explores cutting benefits, raising premiums and tightening eligibility.

Meanwhile, the Tenncare director, Brian Lapps Sr., is suggesting that some beneficiaries of the program are exploiting it. The poorest recipients, Mr. Lapps says, could help pay for their care if they would only curb their use of cell phones and cigarettes.
