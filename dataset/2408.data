Three independent furniture dealers have joined forces to open Phurniture Inc., a 3,500-square-foot shop in NoLIta. The three, who travel in shifts to find new pieces, are Paul Johnson, top center, on a 1989 anodized aluminum chair by Forrest Myers ($15,000); Shaun Cooper, top left, on a decorative brass chair from the 1950's ($3,400 for a pair); and Oliver Miller, on a 1970's patchwork-metal cube by Paul Evans ($2,800). A white stucco-covered garage, (bottom right), here dominated by a black leather sofa by Tobia Scarpa for Cassina ($4,800), serves as the entrance to the space. "It's not supposed to be intimidating," said Mr. Cooper. "From the outside, it looks like a Greek restaurant in the suburbs." The collection, with pieces from the 1940's to the present, features designers that the team believes will supplant some of the current household names. "Before, everyone wanted Eames chairs. Now they want this,"said Mr. Johnson, indicating a pink velvet chaise by Vladimir Kagan. The chaise notwithstanding, most of the furniture has a masculine edge, with dark bent woods, brass and leather predominating. Phurniture Inc. is at 8 Bond Street (Broadway), (212) 575-2925 or phurniture.com. STEPHEN TREFFINGER
