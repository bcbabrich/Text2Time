A bill that would require written permission from drivers before the state could sell or otherwise release information on their licenses has been approved by the Assembly. But the bill cannot be considered by the Senate until it reconvenes in late July.

In a last-minute effort to include the bill in the state budget signed Friday by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the measure was pushed through two budget committees on Thursday and was passed in the Assembly the same day. But the Senate adjourned before acting on the bill. The Governor had proposed selling information on drivers' licenses to generate $11 million for the state, but ran into roadblocks from legislators who said it could endanger the public and infringe on privacy rights.
