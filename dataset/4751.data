Drazen Petrovic brought a shooter's mentality to the National Basketball Association two years ago from Yugoslavia. But it wasn't until the Nets freed him from the Portland Trail Blazers' bench on Jan. 23 that he got a chance to demonstrate it on a regular basis.

Tonight he scored 22 points, including four 3-pointers, in 22 minutes in paving the way for the Nets' 98-93 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.

Petrovic made two appearances in the game, the first in the second period when the Nets needed to overcome an 18-6 Bucks' start. Decisive Spree

His second appearance came with 6 minutes 9 seconds remaining and the Nets trailing, 82-78. A little more than 2 minutes later, Petrovic went on a spree that led the Nets to their second victory in three nights.
