PERPIGNAN, France — Photographers working on personal projects that focus on social issues received $10,000 each on Thursday from the 2016 Getty Images Grants for Editorial Photography. The awards were announced here at the Visa pour l’Image festival.

The winners included Jonathan Torgovnik for “The ‘Hijacked’ Life of African Migrants in Johannesburg”; Sergey Ponomarev for “Exodus,” a project on the migrants and refugees of the Middle East and Africa; Katie Orlinsky for “Chasing Winter,” on climate change in Alaska; and Mary Frances Calvert for “Prisoners of War: Male-on-Male Rape in America’s Military.”

Kirsten Luce received the David Laidler Memorial Award for her project “Border Insecurity,” which examines human trafficking and the drug trade between Texas and Mexico.

This was Mr. Torgovnik’s second Getty grant. In 2007 he received funding for his seminal work on women who were raped during the Rwandan genocide and later gave birth.

His current proposal focuses on African migrant workers from Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya and Nigeria, among other countries, who are living in derelict buildings in Johannesburg.

“At a time when the world’s attention is directed towards the thousands of African migrants trying to make their way north, to reach the shores of Europe, little attention is given to the fact that thousands of African migrants are looking south, and arriving in Johannesburg, one of Africa’s most affluent cities,” Mr. Togovnik wrote in an email exchange.

Ms. Calvert’s work is part of a searing, continuing project on military sexual trauma. Her work on the sexual assault on women by their male colleagues in the United States Armed Forces won first prize in World Press Photo’s Long-Term Projects category this year. Chapters of the series have been published on Lens including most recently on female veterans who became homeless after surviving military sexual trauma. In 2013 she received the Canon Female Photojournalist Award at the Visa pour l’Image photography festival to work on earlier chapters of this project.

In Ms. Luce’s grant proposal, she wrote that the Rio Grande Valley is “the busiest corridor for drug and human smuggling in the United States. Unauthorized migrants passing here must hire savvy smugglers and evade law enforcement every step of the way.”

Ms. Orlinsky’s project on climate change in Alaska focuses on the effects on the way of life — and the very existence — of indigenous communities. A dozen native villages are in danger of eroding away and must be relocated, she wrote in her grant proposal.

Mr. Ponomarev was part of a team of photographers for The New York Times that won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography for coverage of Europe’s refugee crisis. He intends to continue pursuing the story by photographing the settlement of the refugees and how Europeans and the new arrivals “find new ways to live together,” he said.
