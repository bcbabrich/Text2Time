To the Editor:

Now that the Garden State Arts Center has been renamed for a bank and the Brendan Byrne Arena for an airline, how soon can the entire state be peddled off, henceforth to be known as the Ocean Spray State or the Campbell Soup State?

California and New York, take note; the possibilities are unlimited.
