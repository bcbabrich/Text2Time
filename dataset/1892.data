Representatives from Consolidated Edison and the union that covers nearly 9,000 workers at the utility returned to the bargaining table on Tuesday morning after a three-day cooling-off period. Instead of digging into the latest counterproposal from Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America, the two sides first debated the size of the negotiation table and who should have a seat, according to a union spokesman, Joe Flaherty, who likened the fracas to the Paris peace talks in the 1970s when North Vietnam, the United States and other parties argued about the table.

Talks finally got under way around 10 a.m., an hour late, Mr. Flaherty said. The new deadline for talks is tonight at 11:59 p.m.

There was a notable addition to the table this morning: Barbara C. Deinhardt, the chairwoman of the New York State Employment Relations Board. She is in effect serving as a proxy for Gov. David A. Paterson, who called for the cooling off period late Saturday night after it became clear that the two sides were not going to reach an agreement before the Sunday morning deadline.

Ms. Deinhardt joined Hezekiah Brown, the private mediator chosen by both sides last week, but who was unable to bring the sides together before.

Mr. Brown is the retired former head of State Employment Relations Board under former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.

The two sides have been arguing over proposals by Con Edison to raise wages by about 1.5 percent, to create 401(k)-style pensions for new workers and changes to the pension and health care plans, according to union representatives. Con Edison has declined to discuss the details of the talks or the tenor of the negotiations.

The union is represented by Harry Farrell, the president of Local 1-2, the national president and vice president of the UWUA, the general counsel for Local 1-2, Sidney Kalban, and the associate counsel for the union from the law firm of Levy Ratner.

Con Edison is represented by Claude Trahan, the vice president of human resources, and another dozen or so lawyers and budget experts for the company.

The two sides are meeting in TriBeCa, at 345 Hudson Street, where the state Employment Relations Board has offices.
