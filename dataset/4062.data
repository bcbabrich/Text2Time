This policy is also making for some testy competition between Americans and Kenyans in United States road racing, long the model for events worldwide. ''It is moving in that direction,'' said LeMay, 29, who works as a computer engineer because he cannot afford to run full time. ''The competition on the roads is overwhelming. At Falmouth, I was getting swamped. After a certain point, you just say to yourself, 'I hope I can be the first American.' ''

Certainly, the United States is not quite the land of opportunity it once was for Kenyan runners, who for years have flocked to road races here. When based here, Kamau, 25, lives with five other Kenyan runners in Norristown, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. Kamau is married with two children and owns a modest farm in the central Kenyan village of Muranga, but running is his ticket to prosperity, as it is for other Kenyans.

''The problem is that at some races the money only goes to Americans,'' Kamau said. ''These races have lost their fame. A big race is when the competition is stiff and everyone has an equal chance to fight for the prize.''

The largess for Americans is distributed in several ways. At Falmouth, there were two prize structures, one for overall finish and one for Americans, enabling the 30th-place man, an American, to win the same $400 as the eighth-place man, a Kenyan. At the 13 races for men and 11 for women this year on the USA Running Circuit, most of the $250,000 prize money is for Americans only, effectively shutting out foreign opposition.

A third system will be used by the New York City Marathon, which offers bonuses to Americans but only if they finish high in the overall standings. If an American places third, he or she would pocket $20,000, as opposed to $10,000 for foreigners. First place is worth $30,000, but for Americans it is more than tripled to $100,000. Winners also receive an automobile.

''We're trying to encourage Americans to shoot for the grand prize,'' said the marathon director, Allan Steinfeld.

An American man has as much chance of winning this year's New York City Marathon as the Jets have of winning the Super Bowl. The New York field is led by the three-time Boston Marathon winner Cosmas Ndeti and this year's Boston winner, Moses Tanui, both from Kenya. The leading American male entered is the unheralded 33-year-old Alfredo Vigueras of San Antonio.
