HONDA ACCORD EX V6 Honda's bread-and-butter midsize car just keeps getting better. Like the boomers who've been buying it for more than 20 years, it has matured and expanded, trading youthful exuberance for staid middle age.

The latest, sixth-generation Accord, introduced last fall, is significant in many ways: It is longer, taller, significantly roomier and more powerful than the previous car. This Accord was designed specifically for American tastes and it is built only in Ohio, with 97 percent of its parts American-made. The coupe and the sedan share virtually no exterior parts except their headlights. And the number of components was reduced by 15 percent, keeping prices in check.

While the ultraconservative lines of the Accord sedan were drawn in Japan, the coupe's somewhat more liberal styling sprang from Honda's Ohio development center. The front end is generic Honda (which, these days, looks a lot like generic Toyota), and a flowing roof line tapers back toward the most daring feature, a high back end with a huge bumper and a fender-to-fender reflective panel that evokes the NSX from Acura, Honda's luxury division.

Engines have long been Honda's forte, and the company has outdone itself again. The four-cylinder power plant has been reworked and enlarged from 2.2 to 2.3 liters. Because of its variable valve timing -- a complex bit of magic with which the opening of the intake valves changes based on the engine speed, for optimal combustion -- it is peppy, superefficient and so clean that the car qualifies as a low-emission vehicle in all 50 states. Indeed, the EX model sold in California is the first gas-powered car to meet stricter, ultra-low-emission standards.

The four-cylinder ought to please most people, but the power-hungry have an alternative: a new 3-liter, 200-horsepower V6 that also has variable valve timing -- a first for a V6. It idles in silence and accelerates with silky, easy athleticism. But put your foot down and it revs freely to 6,000 r.p.m. and beyond. Alas, the four-speed automatic -- a good, smooth one, to be sure -- only flirts with the engine's capabilities, and a five-speed manual doesn't come with the V6.

Of course, Honda knows that sporty-car types will look instead to the Prelude and that style mavens will consider the Acura CL -- a car that shares much with the Accord coupe, including its engines. If this oh-so-mainstream coupe has a distinct lack of personality, it is partly by design.

No complaints, though, about the way it drives or rides. The handling was stable and predictable even in driving rain and severe winds, but the suspension would rather comfort your backside than hug the curves. And while the Accord rides rather well, there was enough wind hum -- granted, during a spell of nasty, windy weather -- that it seemed incongruous in the opulent cabin.
