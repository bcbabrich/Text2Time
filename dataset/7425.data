BOSTON, March 31—Francis Cardinal König, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vienna, defended Pope Pius XII today for “doing what he thought was best at the moment,” during Hitler's massacre of the Jews in World War II.

Cardinal König made his observations during a news conference at the Paulist Fathers Roman Catholic Information Center after he was asked to comment on Rolf Hochhuth's play, “The Deputy.”

The play accuses Pius of failing to speak out strongly against the mass murders.

Cardinal König said, “It is easier to talk about what should have been done 20 years later, when you have more information at hand.” He asserted that the play “grossly misrepresented” the role of the church during the World War II era.

The Austrian prelate arrived here last night as the guest of the Paulist Fathers and of Richard Cardinal Cushing of Boston. He will open a threeweek lecture tour tomorrow night.
