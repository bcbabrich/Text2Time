Since World War I, Fort Amador has been the jewel of the American military presence here, dominating the Pacific Ocean entrance of the Panama Canal. But on Tuesday, the 207-acre site, which includes the residence of the United States Army commander, is to be transferred to Panamanian control.

The change is the beginning of a marked acceleration in the pace of the American withdrawal from Panama. Over the next year, the United States is also scheduled to hand over Albrook Air Force Station, Gorgas Hospital and the Arraijan fuel depot and reduce its strength here from 6,800 to 4,400 soldiers.

In addition, by the time the Federal Government's 1997 fiscal year ends next Sept. 30, the headquarters of the United States Southern Command, here on Quarry Heights in one form or another since 1916, plans to have left for its new billet in Miami.

Among Panamanians, that prospect has awakened as much apprehension as pride.

With barely three years remaining before the final American departure, this country of 2.5 million people finds itself rummaging for ways to put these newly reverting areas to use and gradually realizing that maintenance costs will be huge, especially if private investment projects fail to materialize.
