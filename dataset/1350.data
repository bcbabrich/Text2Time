Now that Thomas Casarella is leaving the Treasury Department as its acting restructuring chief, he intends to catch up on some light reading. Only it doesn’t involve picking up the latest James Patterson novel.

Instead, Mr. Casarella told DealBook on Friday, his final day at the Treasury, his reading list includes such tomes as these:

A hefty paper that Thomas Russo, the former Lehman Brothers general counsel, wrote about the aftermath of the financial crisis.

A paper from the Harvard Law School professor Morgan Ricks on how to fix money market funds.

Memos to President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner about the commercial real estate markets.

“Things have been crazy around here, so I’ve accumulated a knee- to waist-high pile of stuff that I’ve wanted to read,” he said in an interview by phone.

That’s because for more than two years, Mr. Casarella, 33, has been one of the Treasury’s top restructuring officers, charged with supervising the government’s role in reorganizing the American International Group and Ally Financial.

He began at the Treasury in the spring of 2009, following stints at Lazard and Brookfield Asset Management, at the behest of his mentor, James E. Millstein. (Mr. Millstein, a former top executive of Lazard’s restructuring business, left Treasury in February.)

At the time, A.I.G. was still in the throes of the controversy over bonus payments to executives in its financial products arm, the unit that nearly sank the firm. “A.I.G. was a bad word around Washington and across the country,” Mr. Casarella said.

Since then, the government has helped recapitalize A.I.G. and subsequently sold a portion of its shares in the insurer. It also injected additional capital into Ally, helping to shore up the lender once known as GMAC Financial Services.

“A.I.G. has a really strong C.E.O. and a strong management team, guys that really know what they’re doing,” he said. “Ally’s had to keep a lot of balls in the air. There’s more stability and more consistency in the management team there then there has been in some time.”

The goal, Mr. Casarella said, was essentially to work himself and Mr. Millstein out of their jobs. Much of the work left for A.I.G. and Ally will be in the hands of Timothy G. Massad, the assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, and Matthew Pendo, who heads up the department’s investment office. It is essentially shifting Treasury’s duties from restructuring those companies to monetizing the government’s stakes in them.

When that happens is related to when the capital markets again become hospitable to big, risky stock offerings by financial institutions. A.I.G. shares fell shortly after the company’s share sale in May, though at Friday’s closing price of $29.98 they are back above the offer price of $29.

As for what’s next for Mr. Casarella, the future for now means a return home to San Francisco, as well as travel and training for a triathlon and a marathon. Beyond that, he said, is probably a return to the private sector.

But where exactly? “Your guess is as good as mine,” he said.
