With eight days to go before classes in New York City's public schools are scheduled to resume, officials said yesterday that they could not complete the emergency inspection program for asbestos in time to open all schools.

The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said that at best they would be able to declare only some of the city's 1,069 schools free of asbestos hazards and ready to open on the first day of school, Sept. 9.

The inability to complete the emergency inspection, ordered by Mayor David N. Dinkins on Aug. 6, now creates a major problem for city officials and the new Schools Chancellor, Raymond C. Cortines, whose appointment was approved by the Board of Education last night. [ Page B2. ]

Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, said that officials could not rule out having to postpone the first day of school for all the city's 1 million schoolchildren. Stopping short of saying the inspection effort would not be completed, he said a decision would be made today or tomorrow after officials reviewed the latest progress and results.
