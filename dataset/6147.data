ALGIERS, Jan. 1 (Agence France — Presse) — Algeria freed the terrorists group that seized oil ministers in Vienna last month in order to “respect the wishes of the governments involved in this affair,” the Algiers newspaper El Moudjahid declared today.

The decision to free the raiders headed by Carlos Martinez, also known as the Jackal, was therefore not the sole responsibility of Algeria, the newspaper stated. It noted that one of the conditions imposed by the group for releasing the ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was that the terrorists should then be freed.

As a result, Moudjahid said, the terrorists were set free “the day after total completion of the operation.” It described comment in the Western press on Algeria's action as “base denigrations.”

“Algeria's action was legally right and in accordance with the firm recommendations of the other countries of the organization” to protect the hostages, Moudjahid wrote.
