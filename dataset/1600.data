In the United States and in France, investors have swooped in and bought big stakes of companies without anyone knowing, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column this week. Given the importance of transparency in the markets, he asks, shouldn’t something be done about these legal, if aggressive, maneuvers?

Big Investors Appear Out of Thin Air

By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

About a week ago, Bernard Arnault’s fashion empire, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, surprised the French establishment by announcing that it had acquired a 17 percent stake in Hermès International. Two weeks earlier, Bill Ackman, the activist hedge fund investor, and Vornado Realty Trust, the real estate company, shocked Wall Street when they disclosed that they had acquired a nearly 27 percent stake in J.C. Penney, the mass-market retailer.

But hold on a minute: how is it possible that these corporate raiders were able to accumulate such large positions without anyone knowing?

In the United States — and in France — regulators require all investors to disclose anytime they accumulate more than a 5 percent ownership stake in a company. The rule in the United States, known as 13D, along with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires activist investors to disclose when they invest more than about $60 million, is meant to provide the markets with a sense of transparency so that certain investors cannot just sneak up out of nowhere.

And yet, that is exactly what seems to be happening.

Mr. Ackman took advantage of a rule giving investors 10 days to disclose their position after breaking the 5 percent ownership threshold. In his case, once he passed the threshold, he and Vornado sprinted to buy up tens of millions of shares before having to show their hand.

Mr. Arnault’s approach was perhaps more insidious: he used derivatives to build up a stealth position in Hermès starting in 2008 so that he would not have to declare ownership until he was ready to pounce.

It is all legal. But the real question is, Should it be?

“Unless and until lawmakers and securities regulators in the U.S. adopt disclosure requirements in accord with what is now the global consensus toward full and fair disclosure of equity derivatives and other synthetic and nonstandard ownership and control techniques, U.S. corporations are well advised to adopt such self-help measures as are available,” Adam O. Emmerich and William Savitt, partners at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, wrote in a note to clients.

Corporate boards have removed many of their defenses, like poison pills, in the last several years as part of efforts to be more open and democratic, under pressure from shareholders and powerful advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services.

But the 13D rule and others like it have not been updated in decades. Years ago, in an age before e-mail, a 10-day grace period for disclosure might have made sense; today, it makes less. In Britain, for example, the rules are much stricter: investors have just 48 hours to declare passing a 3 percent threshold, making it virtually impossible to build up a large stake without the markets having fair warning.

The use of derivatives to create stealth positions is even more worrisome. In 2008, I wrote about this topic when Jana Partners, a hedge fund, used a series of swaps to buy a 21 percent stake in CNet. Since then, other examples have emerged: A judge ruled that the Children’s Investment Fund had improperly used derivatives to influence the vote in a proxy contest involving CSX, the railroad company. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said the practice “permits a long party to ambush an issuer with a holding far greater than 5 percent.”

In the case of LVMH’s ambush of Hermès, Mr. Arnault explained in a filing that his company had acquired contracts on financial futures called equity swaps in 2008 “on the equivalent of 5 million and 4.8 million shares of Hermès, whose deadlines were set between January and May 2011.” Then, LVMH, through subsidiaries, “entered into amendments to these contracts so that they would receive physical delivery of underlying securities.”

It is a clever gambit. And it does not appear to have skirted any law.

A spokesman for LVMH, Jim Fingeroth of Kekst & Company, declined to comment. In a strange twist, Mr. Fingeroth also happens to represent J.C. Penney; he declined to comment on its behalf as well.

There is another side to this story. In speaking with a handful of investors’ activists who have employed some of these practices themselves — and refused to comment on the record for obvious reasons — it is clear that if the government reduced the 10-day period that investors had to disclose their positions after passing 5 percent, these investors would not seek to take such stakes because it would be too expensive.

Other investors rarely complain about stealth accumulation because it typically benefits them. During the 10-day period that Mr. Ackman and Vornado raced to buy up shares of J.C. Penney, the company’s shares rose 45 percent. If you believe in shareholder democracy and in what many of these activists do is press for changes on management and within boards, and they argue that placing higher barriers to ownership would make them less likely, not more, to pursue change.

“No one would be able to build a stake in anything,” one activist investor said. “We think we’re ultimately good for the capital markets.”

True. But given the ultimate push for more transparency in the markets, it seems like a conversation that regulators should consider having.
