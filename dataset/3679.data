One of the early successes of American diplomacy in the region was persuading Ukraine to give up its nuclear arsenal, which was the second-largest in the Soviet Union after Russia's.

Washington has sent about $250 million in aid a year to Ukraine in an effort to insure its independence and bolster its economy, an amount that has made Ukraine the third-largest recipient of American foreign aid.

The Clinton Administration has justified the assistance by asserting that it would be difficult for Russia to become an imperial power again without Ukraine falling back into its clutches.

But foreign investors, citing rampant corruption, have largely stayed away from Ukraine -- the country has attracted a paltry $2 billion in outside direct investment. Industry and agriculture remain almost entirely state-run.

But under President Kuchma, Washington says, Ukraine has followed through on two important counts.

First, Mr. Kuchma is ambivalent -- but unlike Russia not hostile -- to NATO expansion. And this spring he agreed, under pressure from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to cancel the sale of two turbines destined for a nuclear reactor in Iran. That made Ukraine's record on deterring the spread of nuclear arms much better than Russia's.

In canceling the sale of the turbines, Mr. Kuchma found an effective negotiating tactic with Washington.

Publicly, Mr. Kuchma has complained that his country was not compensated sufficiently for the loss of the $45 million order or for the loss of other commercial opportunities in Iran. Privately, Mr. Kuchma has told Washington that Ukraine should be rewarded for the cancellation in ''units of I.M.F. funding,'' a Clinton Administration official said.
