Let's hope we don't station troops in Sudan; if we do, the Pentagon may encourage Americans to observe local mores like owning slaves and mutilating female genitals.

We need bases in the gulf. But they'll be more useful to us -- and less likely to provoke unrest -- in Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.

Saudi Arabia was once seen as the center of the Arab world. But lower oil prices pushed per capita income down from $28,600 in current dollars in 1981 to $7,230 in 2000. The economic excitement in the region is in Dubai, and the political innovation in Bahrain. As a senior Kuwaiti official told me as I was about to leave for Riyadh, ''Set your watch back 100 years.''

Take the Saudi pettifoggery that forbids the practice of faiths other than Islam. Foreigners are not supposed to wear crosses, and Bibles are banned. (I smuggled in a Bible to see what the customs officials would say, but they didn't inspect my bags.)

One reason for optimism about Saudi Arabia is its hypocrisy: Saudi Arabians are more open-minded than their country. Nobody minds that foreigners discreetly attend religious services in embassies. And while alcohol is strictly forbidden, I attended a dinner party where everybody was gulping Scotch or vodka. (I had Scotch in hopes I would be caught and flogged, which would have made a great column!)

Unfortunately, since 1979, when Saudi Arabia was shaken by the seizure of Mecca's Grand Mosque by religious extremists, the royal family has tried to minimize the fundamentalist threat -- on some issues -- by meeting the extremists part way.

King Abdel Aziz, Abdullah's father and the founder of Saudi Arabia, was not so timid. When fundamentalists opposed cars, radio and the telegraph as non-Islamic, he fought back. He showed that the radio could be used to broadcast the Koran, that the telegraph could transmit it. He dared tug his country toward modernity.

There are hopeful signs that Prince Abdullah could have some of his father's mettle. He is revising school curriculums, condemning Islamic extremism and easing restrictions on the press. If Abdullah was only bold enough to take steps that reformers are urging, such as allowing women to drive, introducing elections for the National Advisory Council and promoting a tolerant and pluralist vision of Islam that would not be threatened by Bibles or by Anne Frank, then he could rescue the Saudi-American relationship -- and his own country as well.
