Opposition politicians grumbled about a deal in a smoke-filled room. One leading newspaper speculated that it had been sealed over glasses of port at Brooks, a luxurious Establishment club.

Not so, said Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, as he answered questions Friday about reforms the exchange plans to accept in return for an end to a long and expensive legal battle with the Government's Office of Fair Trading, which has accused it of about 150 restrictive practices. To start with, Sir Nicholas noted wryly, he does not smoke or drink port and he is not a member of Brooks.

The deal, worked out between Sir Nicholas and Cecil Parkinson, the new Trade Secretary, surprised the financial community and those who follow it because it contained so few concessions by the exchange.

Three Key Elements

The agreement has three key elements. The most important is the promise to phase out the exchange's minimum commissions on securities transactions by the end of 1986, a transition the New York Stock Exchange made in 1975 in just 18 months. The two others allow nonmembers to play a larger role in the affairs of member companies and the exchange itself, including the council that runs it.
