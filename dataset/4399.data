The voters in what was once the most rigidly Communist country of Europe have dealt a sharp rebuff to their President, to whom they handed a landslide victory in their first democratic elections in 1992.

As a result, Albanians and diplomats fear that the infant democracy has lapsed into a deadlock that puts at risk the political and economic gains achieved since Communism began to crumble in 1991 in Europe's poorest country.

Early in November, Albania's voters rejected by 54 percent to 42 percent a draft constitution that President Sali Berisha had placed before the electorate. Dr. Berisha circumvented the Parliament, where approval by two-thirds would have been required, and chose a referendum in the belief that he was sure to win a majority.

The defeat is seen here as the low point in a steady decline in affection for the once hugely popular leader of the Democratic Party, not for what he has done but for how he does it.
