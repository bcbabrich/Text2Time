The lawyer Melvin Belli has turned down a request for legal assistance from Richard Ramirez, who has been charged with 15 murders in a series of assaults in northern and southern California.

''I'm ashamed I had to tell him I couldn't take it because it's a case I certainly would like to take,'' the San Francisco lawyer said in an interview published today by The Daily News of Los Angeles.

''Economically and timewise, I just can't take the case,'' he said. ''I would be tied up for two years.''

Mr. Ramirez, a 25-year-old drifter from El Paso, faces 60 other felony counts, including rape and child molestation, in the attacks, known as the Night Stalker killings.
