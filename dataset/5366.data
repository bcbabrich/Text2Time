To the Editor:

Politicians of both parties these days say our nation cannot afford to have a paralyzed Presidency. But can it afford not to have one?

An inactive Presidency is surely better than a misdirected one. This Administration needs a good long pause for reflection and recommitment.

More to be feared than paralysis is some precipitate, dangerous act to divert attention from what needs correction. ERNEST DICKINSON Chappaqua, N.Y., Dec. 23, 1986
