A Napster fan who posted an anonymous note on an Internet message board yesterday afternoon may have best articulated the reaction of the music-swapping service's users to the news that they may no longer be able to use Napster to copy as much music as they want, free:

''This is the end, my only friend, the end,'' wrote the fan, ''No. 5446,'' quoting The Doors. ''It hurts to set you free, but you'll never follow me.''

''Sniff, sing it 5446, bwaaaaaaa,'' another user replied.

Napster, the Internet company that has attracted a staggering 38 million users in its 18 months of existence by wresting control of music distribution from the major record labels, said yesterday that it would join the media giant Bertelsmann to develop a fee-based service.

For Bertelsmann, the deal means direct access to the most passionate group of music lovers on the Internet. For Napster, it means a chance finally to make money on a service that has so far been as unprofitable as it has been enormously popular. Bertelsmann will lend Napster an undisclosed sum to help develop the tracking technology that would permit labels and artists to be compensated for the music traded using Napster's service.

Once the system is in place, the media conglomerate has said, it will drop its copyright infringement lawsuit against Napster and will take an equity stake in the company. But the ultimate success of the deal will depend on whether the Napster users at the heart of the alliance will remain loyal to a service that has abandoned its main principle -- free music, all the time.
