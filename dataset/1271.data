You might be wondering how Seattle fans are feeling about their Seahawks. It turns out that many are about as excited as most N.F.L. fans about the prospect of a losing team making the playoffs.

Danny O’Neil, The Seattle Times:

It’s fair for you to wonder whether an NFL team that has lost all nine games by 15 or more points has any business saying “postseason” let alone playing in it. So it’s understandable that most of you who responded to a poll on The Seattle Times’ website Sunday and Monday said you’d prefer Seattle lose the regular-season finale to St. Louis. But to hope for the team to lose? Really? You want the Seahawks’ division rival to come to Qwest Field and clinch that franchise’s first playoff berth in six years?

Seattle could lose 10 spots in the draft by winning, and some Seahawks fans would like to draft Jake Locker, the hugely popular quarterback from Washington.

In an earlier column, O’Neil wrote that reseeding and other playoff formulas would not necessarily make things better:

For better or worse, the NFL decided that divisions mean something. That’s why schedules are weighted, teams playing every team in their division twice. If the NFL doesn’t want to emphasize division champions in the playoff seeding, it shouldn’t emphasize division play in the schedule. So make your jokes about the NFC West. It’s a deservingly awful target. Just don’t fool yourself that there’s a simple fix for playoff formats.

Extra point: Maybe there is no simple fix. But surely there has to be a better way. The Giants, who crushed the Seahawks in Seattle earlier this season, could miss out on the playoffs with a 10-6 record. If the Seahawks beat the Rams on Sunday night, they will be in at 7-9.
