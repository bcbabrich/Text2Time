A CUSTOM RE-CREATED

Tucked away amid the many architectural gems of Greenwich Village is an 1832 brick town house that was owned for nearly a century by Seabury Tredwell, a prosperous merchant. The three-story house was restored in the 1970's and reopened in 1979 as the Old Merchants House, a museum of 19th-century American decorative arts. It will celebrate the new year with an elegant re-creation of the long-ago custom of ''social calling'' this afternoon from 1 to 6. The parlor's Victorian Christmas tree will be lighted, refreshments will be served, and the home's collection of silver, china, whale-oil lamps, chandeliers, and 19th-century furniture and clothing will be on view. The Old Merchants House is at 29 East Fourth Street. Admission is $5; $2 for students and the elderly. The number for more information is 777-1089. SOPHOCLES IN REVIVAL This may be the ultimate, dust-off-that-old-material theater revival. A 2,500-year-old comedy by Sophocles called ''The Searching Satyrs'' that the director says has not been performed by a professional acting company since 440 B.C. is being presented at the Nat Horne Theater, 440 West 42d Street, beginning tonight. This amalgam of dance, mime and theater is described as a farce about the invention of music, the young god Hermes and the pilfered sacred cattle of the sun. This work - like other so-called satyr plays - was written as a sort of light second feature to be performed after a Greek tragedy. Fragments of the play were discovered in 1907, and the current production was adapted and directed by Gary Beck. ''The Searching Satyrs'' is produced by Sidewalks Theater, a company that specializes in rarely performed theater works. Performances are Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 P.M., with matinees on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets are $15; $12 for students and the elderly. Information: 279-4200. ALONG THE HUDSON

Magnificent views of the Hudson River are the main attraction of a guided New Year's Day walk along the Haverstraw Bay and Croton Point shoreline in Westchester County. This free 2 P.M. hike will be led by Christopher Letts, a naturalist, and will end with a driftwood bonfire on the beach, where walkers can celebrate 1988 with a mug of hot cider and toasted marshmallows. Mr. Letts will lead another walk in search of winter birds, beginning at 10 A.M. on Sunday. The walks depart from the parking lot of Croton Point Park, which is on Croton Avenue in Croton-on-Hudson. A third free nature walk sponsored by the Westchester Parks Department and the Hudson River Foundation will focus on winter life on the Hudson estuary, and will include a visit to the 105-year-old Tarrytown Lighthouse. This walk, also led by Mr. Letts, will begin at 2 P.M. on Sunday at the parking lot of Kingsland Point Park, on Pierson Street in North Tarrytown. Both parks can be reached by Route 9.

CANDLELIGHT MANOR TOURS

The clock will be turned back 200 years this weekend at Van Cortlandt Manor, in Croton-on-Hudson, where the holiday traditions of the 18th century will be re-created during two evenings of candlelight tours. The grounds and rooms of this historic estate will be bathed in candlelight, as carolers sing and fiddlers fiddle; a holiday feast will be prepared and visitors will cross the manor's threshold beneath a ''kissing bell'' of mistletoe and fruits. Costumed guides will be on hand in each room, the dining room table will be filled with New Year's desserts, and cider and cookies will be served in the gift shop. The self-guided tours are Saturday and Sunday from 5 to 9 P.M., and admission is $5; $4.50 for the elderly, and $3 for students. Van Cortlandt Manor is part of Historic Hudson Valley, a series of 17th-to-20th-century estates along 80 miles of the Hudson River that were formerly known as Sleepy Hollow Restorations. The manor is near the Croton Point Avenue exit of Route 9. Information: (914) 631-8200. STAR SHOWS, OLD AND NEW

During the 65 years since Walther Bauersfeld came up with the idea of depicting stars and planets with a projection device, planetarium technology has come a long way. These advances are illustrated at the Andrus Planetarium of the Hudson River Museum, at 511 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers, where the newest Zeiss planetarium projector was introduced five weeks ago, and an exhibition about planetarium history is on view through April 24. The show includes photographs of ancient and medieval astronomical devices and modern planetariums, as well as a model of an early Zeiss star projector from the 1939 New York World's Fair. A sky show called ''Cosmic Journey,'' which explains quasars, black holes and other seeming astronomical mysteries, is shown Saturdays and Sundays at 1 and 3 P.M.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 4 P.M., and Thursdays at 7 P.M. Another show, ''The Seasonal Night Sky,'' simulates the current sky on a clear night, and is shown Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 4 P.M. The planetarium is open Wednesdays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. (Thursdays till 9 P.M.), and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $3; $1.50 for children and the elderly. (Museum admission is an additional $2; $1 for children and the elderly, except on Saturdays, when admission to both museum and planetarium is $3.75; $2 for children and the elderly.)
