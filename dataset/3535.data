With his uncommonly assured first two films, ''Spanking the Monkey'' and the pitch-perfect ''Flirting With Disaster,'' the writer and director David O. Russell didn't need much to make an indelible impression. His timing was fabulous, his ideas fresh and his taboo-busting imagination much to be admired. Now Mr. Russell moves onto a much bigger battlefield with ''Three Kings,'' an absurdist, gimlet-eyed ''Catch-22'' for the Persian Gulf war. It's ultimately a much more ambitious and impassioned work. But it isn't nearly as successful a showcase for this filmmaker's extraordinary talents.

Though Mr. Russell is most impressive for his writing and his immensely witty direction of actors, ''Three Kings'' begins by placing its emphasis firmly elsewhere: on the camera.

Against the huge, bleached panorama of a desert war, which is ending just as the film begins, he sets out to convey the amorality and chaos of the situation. American soldiers celebrate with frat-party abandon and without the faintest interest in what their victory actually means to the people of Iraq. All they know is that they want to go home.

The film captures some of this malaise through the wisecracking of its principals: Special Forces Capt. Archie Gates (George Clooney), a shrewd cowboy type; Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), a new father, and Staff Sgt. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), who is as devout and serious as some of the others are cavalier. These three may not sound like soldier of fortune material, but they wind up joining forces in a scheme to liberate (i.e., steal) a huge stash of confiscated gold.
