Aired Friday night on NBC: Happy Leap Year! This is February 29th. How about that? In fact, when President Bush heard that, he said, “Remember, turn your clocks ahead one year, everybody.”

In a press conference today, President Bushannounced America is not headed into a recession, especially if you own an oil company.

High gas prices leave a bad taste in people’s mouths. Have you noticed that? That’s mostly from the siphoning, but still, it’s a horror.

In fact, gas is so expensive in LA, now when you call 911, they ask you to meet the ambulance halfway.

Yesterday President Bush said that last year an intelligence gap opened up. Last year? Gee, didn’t that open up about 2001, right after the inauguration?

Just 48 hours after Homeland Security officials told Congress a 28-mile long virtual fence along the U.S.-Mexican border was working, they now say it will be delayed three years because they can’t get the video surveillance to work. Isn’t that amazing? Do you realize, Homeland Security has less video surveillance than the New England Patriots.

And in movie news, the movie “Panic Room 2″ is now in development. The whole thing’s going to be filmed at Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters.

And more problems with John McCain. The New York Times is now saying there is a question as to whether McCain is eligible to become president because he was born in Panama. See, his parents were in the military, so he was born in Panama. In fact, the reason they moved away from Panama, the building of the canal was keeping the young John McCain up.

Now, I don’t want to say McCain is old, but yesterday he accidentally got on the wrong bus, ended up taking a gambling junket to Atlantic City.

See, everyone is so concerned now, where all the candidates were born. You know, McCain was born on a military base in Panama, Hillary was born outside Chicago, and if you believe the media, Barack Obama was born in a manger.
