To the Sports Editor:

If the Masters organizing committee thinks that one more sponsor and 12 more minutes of commercials per hour is not the way to go, then rather than attacking the committee for not showing the front nine, Anderson should be praising its sense of maintaining the integrity of the telecast. The committee is right. There is nothing more exciting than the last nine holes of the Masters. DEMETRIOS G. XISTRIS Larchmont, N.Y.
