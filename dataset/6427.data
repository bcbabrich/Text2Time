YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — The crowds of vacationers are pouring into Yosemite again this summer, but here and elsewhere across the country there is a discernible difference from previous years: The visitors are spending less.

Some of the change traces to economic uncertainties and some to new tastes that have been created by new types of camping equipment.

Where once they happily rented tents, or cabins without plumbing, now they drive campers or pull trailers. As alternatives, they want the best accommodations, but they may delay making reservations while they watch the stock market sag.

If there is a shortage of facilities, it is at the top and bottom of the scale—shortages of luxury hotel rooms, or of grassy plots where a bed roll can be flopped out.
