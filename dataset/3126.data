The New York State Lottery named four finalists yesterday in a mandated review on its account, with billings estimated at $60 million.

The account has been at the New York office of Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, since 1998, when it was shifted there from the New York office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.

The finalists are Grey and DDB, along with Bates USA in New York, part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant Communications Group, and Wolf Group New York. A decision is expected in mid-June.
