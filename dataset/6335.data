On Dec. 18, Ha Van Lau said:

“If the United States declares the total and unconditional withdrawal from South Vietnam of its troops and those of the other foreign countries in the U.S. camp within a six‐month period, the parties will discuss the timetable of the withdrawal of these troops and the question of Insuring the safety for such troop withdrawal.”

In this same statement, he said that once the above re quirement is fulfilled, the vari ous forces for peace in Vietnam “will enter into talks to set up a provisional coalition govern ment. ...” Seemingly Hanoi expects the latter to happen; it does not have to be negotiated at Paris.

What might all this mean?

1. For the first time Hanoi has told us how to meet the “total and unconditional with drawal” requirement—by an nouncing it publicly.

2. The key to the announce ment is the certainty that by specified date all of our troops will be withdrawn.

3. While Hanoi says six months, this could be read as a bargaining gambit. Xuan Thuy said that the U.S. “must accept the principle of withdrawal, then put it into practice,” and that some U.S. forces could re main in South Vietnam even as late as the elections to be con ducted by the provisional coali tion government.

4. Hanoi's “total and uncon ditional” phrase remains, rais ing the question as to what we might get in return for our withdrawal announcement. Ha noi hacked away from this same phrase in October, 1968. When we stopped the bombing, Hanoi accepted the condition that the Government of South Vietnam be seated in Paris along with the National Liberation Front as part of a your‐side‐our‐side ar rangement. We also assumed and had reason to believe that Hanoi understood that it should “not take advantage” of our bombing cessation by shelling major cities and by abusing the DMZ. To a degree, Hanoi has lived up to our assumption of “no advantage.”

This past experience is sug gestive of what we could ask from Hanoi now. Politically, we might extract the condition that Hanoi and the N.L.F. agree to talk with the Government of Vietnam about political settle ment. Militarily, we could give Hanoi to understand that we expect its forces in the South to he reduced accordingly, the level of military activity to de cline, and require the return of all American POW's.
