In a 1996 survey called ''Secret Apartheid,'' coordinated by Ms. Doran, Acorn had accused the Board of Education of discriminating against blacks and Hispanics in its gifted programs. On Sept. 25, after an Acorn complaint, the Federal Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights began monitoring whether minority students have access to gifted programs. Ms. Doran said in her lawsuit that Dr. Crew was harassing her and Acorn for filing that complaint and maintained that her dismissal violated her constitutional right to free speech.

The Chancellor based his dismissal on a decision by the city's Conflict of Interest Board, which said that although Ms. Doran appeared to have a conflict between her job and her board position, the Board of Education could seek a waiver from the Conflicts Board allowing her to retain both.

William C. Thompson, the president of the Board of Education, said yesterday that he did not seek such a waiver because he did not want to appear to be favoring any school official or employee. He said that Ms. Doran could have retained both posts if she had agreed to excuse herself from any matters involving the central board, but that she had refused.

Ms. Doran, however, said that Mr. Thompson had never offered her such a compromise.

Mr. Thompson said the dismissal had nothing to do with Acorn's criticism. ''There is not a bad relationship with Acorn, nor is there a bad relationship with Helaine,'' he said.

But Mary Somoza, a member of the board of District 2, which covers Greenwich Village, Tribeca and the Upper East Side, said, ''I think it's retaliation because of the 'Secret Apartheid' report.''
