A Federal jury today began deliberating the Government's charges against Alcee L. Hastings, the first sitting Federal judge to be tried on criminal charges. After deliberating for just over an hour, the jury recessed for the night.

Judge Hastings is charged with conspiracy to solicit and accept a bribe and obstruction of justice. The case went to the jury after it heard Government prosecutors deny contentions by the 46-year-old defendant, Florida's first black Federal judge, that the case against him was racially and politically motivated.

''The charge that there is something sinister in the prosecution of Judge Hastings is supported by no evidence at all,'' the chief Federal prosecutor, Reid Weingarten, told the jury. ''The suggestion that there is something sinister is nothing but a red herring.''

Judge Hastings, who has been on the Federal bench for the District of South Florida since December 1979, was indicted in December 1981, along with William A. Borders, a longtime friend who is a lawyer from Washington, D.C., who was also charged with bribery conspiracy though not with obstruction of justice. The Government says Mr. Borders solicited a $150,000 bribe from a man he thought to be a defendant in a racketeering case before Judge Hastings in exchange for favorable rulings by the judge on sentencing and seizure of property.
