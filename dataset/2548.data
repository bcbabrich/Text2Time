Gant Gaither, a busy Broadway producer in the 1950's who later found his niche as an artist, his first calling, died on Feb. 16 at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 86.

His death was announced in New York by the Grace Kelly Foundation, of which he was a founder.

The foundation awards grants each year to young professionals in the performing arts. Mr. Gaither, a friend of the late Princess Grace of Monaco, a former actress, was a founding trustee in 1982 and remained a trustee and director till his death.

In his heyday, Mr. Gaither produced five plays -- none too successful -- and stayed in the public eye for years with the scripts, artists and productions he was contemplating.

He achieved his second-longest run in 1955 at the ANTA Theater with the musical version of ''Seventh Heaven,'' starring Gloria De Haven, Ricardo Montalban and Kurt Kasznar. It derived from a play of 1922, which in turn became a 1927 movie with Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. The musical closed after 44 performances and became Mr. Gaither's last Broadway production.
