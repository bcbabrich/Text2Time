While lawyers have always prided themselves on their ability to size up a potential juror, Lin Lilley, immediate past president of the American Society of Trial Consultants, said she and her colleagues were concerned about inflated claims by some consultants who advertise their service ''as more of a science than an art.''

''I'm not sure it deserves that elevation,'' she said.

Mr. Farmer, who says he believes jury consultants may be useful to widen the perspective of lawyers who have a limited circle of friends and limited contact with other socioeconomic segments of society, also advises caution in their use.

''If a person uses the word 'girls' to describe women it might indicate sexism, but that doesn't mean a jury consultant can positively predict how a juror may view a case, any more than a smile from a juror means that he likes the attorney and will vote in favor of the attorney's client,'' Mr. Farmer said. Cab Driver as 'Resource'

Philip Corboy, a leading personal injury lawyer in Chicago, said he does not allow trial consultants to make judgments about jurors and witnesses that he believes he should properly make by himself. ''Good lawyers know what to do,'' he said. ''Consultants are only 'another resource.' ''

One of Mr. Corboy's resources is Edward Mika, a full-time Chicago cab driver who occasionally earns $200 for a morning's work helping Mr. Corboy interview jurors. When the juror gives his or her address, Mr. Mika immediately tells Mr. Corboy what neighborhood the juror comes from, as well as the neighborhood's ethnic makeup and level of affluence.

James Rasicot, a Minneapolis-based trial consultant, is known in legal circles as ''the color guy'' for his interpretive approach to the color of potential jurors' clothing.

Mr. Rasicot, who holds academic degrees in psychology and sociology. counsels clients that bright-colored clothes generally are worn by people who crave attention and have a concern for other people; therefore, they tend to be more favorably disposed toward the plaintiff in a civil lawsuit. The color yellow, he says, is a tip-off to a ''more intellectual, fashion-conscious, free-thinker''; dark blue, on the other hand, is generally worn by a subtler, more introverted personality who does not care as much about other people, and thus might be a better juror for the defense.
