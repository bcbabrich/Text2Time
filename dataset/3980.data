Last weekend, Ms. Brotman sat with her 7-year-old daughter, Sylvannah, on a white leather sofa in her father's den and -- between phone calls and cigarettes -- tried to grapple with her losses and plan her return to Liberia, which she said was her only home.

Ms. Brotman left Bennington College in 1968 to take a secretarial position with the New York Blood Center's research laboratory on East 67th Street. But her desk job did not last long. Described as "a brilliant woman and superb manager" by her longtime supervisor, Dr. Alfred M. Prince, Ms. Brotman was dispatched to West Africa in 1971 to try to collect blood samples from wild chimpanzees, then to investigate whether hepatitis B was being transmitted by such blood-sucking insects as bed bugs.

For the insect study, she visited the rooms of prostitutes in the Ivory Coast, spraying pesticides to collect samples. With vermin exterminated, "the prostitutes were very appreciative," Ms. Brotman said.

In 1974, Ms. Brotman moved to Liberia to assemble a colony of chimpanzees for hepatitis studies and vaccine tests. Chimpanzees are well suited for such work because they can carry human hepatitis viruses, Ms. Brotman said, but unlike their human relations do not develop serious illness.

Liberia was ideal, said Dr. Prince, a senior researcher at the Blood Center, because it was part of the chimpanzee's home range. At the jungle compound, the chimps live in spacious outdoor cages, Ms. Brotman said, instead of cramped in small cages inside sealed buildings, as they are in primate centers here.

Ms. Brotman, who moved to Liberia with a daughter from a prior marriage, said she thrived on the "challenge of living in a difficult place." Soon after settling in, she adopted the first of four African girls. In 1986, Ms. Brotman married a British engineer, Brian Garnham, who went to work at the compound.

Scientists at the compound, 40 miles outside of Monrovia, made substantial progress in the fight against viral hepatitis. A vaccine for hepatitis B was developed and tested, and methods for eliminating viruses from blood also were refined there, Dr. Prince said. In addition, the work has helped unravel the puzzle of hepatitis C, which afflicts some four million Americans and millions more overseas, he said. The laboratory also worked on a possible vaccine against the parasite that causes river blindness, an ailment affecting some 17 million Africans.
