Anyone who has traveled to Europe in the summertime knows that a large chunk of the Continent seems to be on vacation on any given day. This is part of the problem facing the clutch of United States-based private equity firms who are hoping to stage an initial public offering overseas, according to a story from Reuters.

Buyout shops such as Texas Pacific Group and Blackstone hope to follow the lead of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which recently raised $5 billion — three times the amount it originally expected — through a listing on the Euronext exchange. But the slow season is coming, and no one is sure if investors will be so receptive to a private equity I.P.O. several months from now.

One lawyer sums the situation up this way:

“If anything, the market will determine the appetite for this type of product,” said Jeffrey Tabak, a lawyer for Weil, Gotshal & Manges who specializes in fund raising. “From a timing perspective, summer is a more difficult time to raise money, especially in Europe. Will the interest still be there after Labor Day?”
