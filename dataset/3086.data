Mr. Gram says novelizing a screenplay is comparable to adapting a book to film: ''You need to be like a chameleon, to be able to take on the tone of a piece and the personalities.'' But there's a huge gulf separating scriptwriters and novelizers, as practitioners of this minor literary genre are called. Screenwriters often feel they don't get enough recognition, but the ones who adapt novels for the screen do have an Academy Award category all to themselves. Those who do the reverse get so little respect even screenwriters scoff at their craft.

The Writers Guild, which represents screenwriters, requires that their members get first crack at the novelizations of movies they have written. But they rarely bother, because compared with screenwriting, novelizing doesn't pay very well. Writers usually earn between $5,000 and $15,000 for a novelization, and they don't normally receive royalties. There's not much chance for glory, either: novelizations are rarely reviewed.

Yet in spite of the low pay and agonizingly acute deadlines, these books are occasionally quite good. James W. Ellison, the author of seven novelizations as well as several novels, wrote a polished and compelling young adult book for ''Finding Forrester,'' which is finding its way into classrooms thanks to its selection by the Scholastic Book Club. When the playwright David Rabe novelized Sean Penn's 1995 film ''The Crossing Guard,'' in which Jack Nicholson played a man obsessed with avenging the drunk-driving death of his young daughter, the book turned out better than the movie. The highly readable ''Gladiator'' offers some historical background that the film glosses over.

Some novelizations have even become classics: the novelist William Kotzwinkle wrote a charming book for Steven Spielberg's ''E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,'' and fans of Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' tried to unravel some of the film's mysteries by reading Arthur C. Clarke's novelization of the screenplay that he wrote with Kubrick. Both books have gone on to long lives on the shelves of bookstores and libraries. In fact, the genres that sell best as novelizations are young adult books, horror and science fiction. Isaac Asimov's novelization of the 1966 film ''Fantastic Voyage'' is still in print, and all of the ''Star Wars'' novelizations have done quite well (then again, everything having to do with ''Star Wars'' is in a universe of its own).

The novelization comes out a few weeks before the film does, but, says Dan Slater, the editor who worked with Mr. Gram on his novelization of ''Gladiator,'' at least half of a novelization's sales are to people who have already seen the film. Of course, having seen the film, they already know the ending, not to mention the beginning and the middle, of the book. But that's part of the point, says Esther Margolis, the president of Newmarket Press, which has published the novelizations of ''Finding Forrester'' and ''Fly Away Home,'' among others. ''When people like a good story,'' she says, ''they'll want to stay with the characters longer.'' And when all goes as planned, the novelization turns a profit by riding the coattails of the film -- the books may be marketing tools for the studios, but the movies are also big commercials for the books.
