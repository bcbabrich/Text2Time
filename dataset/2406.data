On June 19, Jock Soto will celebrate his retirement from the New York City Ballet with a farewell performance at the New York State Theater. Mr. Soto, 40, who has danced with City Ballet since 1981 and has been a principal since 1985, has an astonishing sixth sense: he is a born partner, the finest that has graced the company since Peter Martins himself. There are no fussy moments in a Soto pas de deux. His talent lies in what you don't see happen: his partners don't fall off point or make unsightly wobbles in a pirouette, and knowing that he is in charge let's them jump higher, spin faster and take risks with musical phrasing. As Mr. Soto begins his final season -- which includes a role in a new Martins ballet, "Tala Gaisma," that has its premiere on Wednesday -- Gia Kourlas asked a few of Mr. Soto's favorite partners, past and present, to explain exactly how he made them look good. Of the five, three -- Darci Kistler, Wendy Whelan and Miranda Weese -- are current principals and will dance with Mr. Soto at his farewell performance. Lourdes Lopez and Heather Watts, both retired, are likely to be waiting for him in the wings.
