Stocks had their worst trading session in two months yesterday, as waves of profit taking swept through the market.

The declines were broad based, from computer and drug makers to banks and financial service companies and highly speculative Internet-related stocks.

And it occurred on a day when a sharp drop in commodity prices sent bond prices soaring and interest rates sharply lower. By late in the day, yields on the Government's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 5.07 percent.

By the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent, to 9,116.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 28.70 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,163.63. And the Nasdaq Composite index, which is loaded with computer-related shares, including a number of Internet companies, fell 66.90 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,949.54. Nearly twice as many stocks fell as rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
