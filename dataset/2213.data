HONOLULU, March 31 â€” Heavy rains and a giant sewage spill near Waikiki Beach left residents here beating back floodwaters on Friday and tourists playing board games and watching movies in their hotels.

Several hundred yards of beaches in Honolulu from Ala Moana Park to the military's Hale Koa Hotel in Waikiki were closed to swimmers for a second day because of high bacteria levels, and the rain refused to let up. Five of Oahu's six public golf courses, the Honolulu Zoo and a popular botanical garden were also closed because of flooding.

It has been more than 50 years since Hawaii has had a drenching like the current one. Friday was the 41st day of rain in the Hawaiian Islands and ended one of the wettest Marches on record. The rain began Feb. 19 and has brought with it flash floods, landslides, mudslides and a dam break on Kauai that killed seven people, four of whom are still missing.

"It's really kind of a once-in-a-lifetime situation," said Jim Weyman, a meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office in Honolulu, who attributed the rain to a deep upper-level trough of low pressure just west of the islands. "It makes the air over the Hawaiian Islands unstable."

A sewer line on the back side of Waikiki broke March 24, and the city had to divert the wastewater to the Ala Wai canal until Wednesday, some 48 million gallons over the five and a half days, instead of allowing it to back up into homes, hotels and businesses, said Bill Brennan, a spokesman for the City of Honolulu. The canal leads to the ocean near Waikiki Beach.

"If wastewater backed up into those areas, it would have been catastrophic and certainly devastating," Mayor Mufi Hannemann told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.
