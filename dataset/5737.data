Two great veteran players, Sam Stayman of Palm Beach, Fla., and Cliff Russell of Miami, led teams that survived hard semifinal battles in the Reisinger Knockout Team Championship Thursday night and faced each other in the final last night.

Stayman, with George Tornay, Saul Bronstein, Mike Engel and August Boehm, all of New York, and Richard Reisig of Lake Park, Fla., staged a remarkable semifinal recovery in play at the Beverly Club, 130 East 57th Street.

He trailed into the final 16 deals against the team led by Kathie Wei of New York by 34 points, but gained 38 points to win by just 4.

Aggressive Bidding

In the other semifinal, Russell, teamed with John Solodar of New York, Bobby Levin of Miami Beach and Larry Cohen of Los Angeles, pulled away in the last quarter to win by 27 points against the team led by Ron Gerard of White Plains.
