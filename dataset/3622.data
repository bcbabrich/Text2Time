A proposal to toughen drunken driving laws around the country was dealt a serious blow tonight after a House panel voted to squelch the measure by keeping it from a vote on the floor.

The decision by a voice vote of the Rules Committee was a hard-fought lobbying victory for beer distributors and restaurant chains. They had argued that the proposal, which would have forced states to adopt a stricter definition of drunken driving or risk losing Federal highway funds, would have cut into their sales of alcoholic beverages. The proposal, already approved in the Senate, would have lowered the legal limit for intoxication to a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent, as opposed to most states' standard of 0.10 percent.

The panel's decision tonight left millions of members of the group Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which has lobbied for the measure on Capitol Hill and in state legislatures for 14 years, wondering where they should turn next.

By keeping the proposal off the floor, Republicans sought to fend off an emotional debate on drunken driving and block a vote on an amendment that members may have found difficult to oppose. The Senate had approved an identical amendment to its highway bill on March 4 by a 62-to-32 vote, a margin typically large enough to encourage the House to act. But with the House panel's rejection of the amendment, its chances of survival through conference between the two houses appears dim.
