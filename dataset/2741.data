The conflict with Iraq is not only intended to topple the government of Saddam Hussein. It is also intended to establish a new military lesson. The paradigm being pushed by Mr. Rumsfeld is one that touts the striking force of American air power and the agility of special forces, but sees less of a role for the Army's heavy armored divisions.

A final assessment of the strategy will have to await the battle for Baghdad. Mr. Rumsfeld also has defenders who say he is determined to stimulate change and challenge long-entrenched patterns of military thinking, even at the risk of offending retired and active duty generals.

What nobody disputes, however, is that the American force that is fighting in Iraq is fundamentally different from the one used during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The doctrine applied in 1991 was one of overwhelming force. Then, the Pentagon sent Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf forces he did not even request. A premium was placed on holding risks to an absolute minimum.

When the war came, it began with a 39-day bombing campaign. Then a ground force of more than 500,000 swung into action. The idea was to build up combat power, vanquish the enemy and then quickly withdraw, a concept that came to be known as the Powell doctrine, after Gen. Colin L. Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and current secretary of state.

This time, however, the force is much smaller, some 180,000, more than half of which is currently operating inside Iraq. This time the land attack preceded the main air attack, a strategy reversal that commanders say was needed to maintain surprise and seize the Rumaila oil fields but which increased the risk to allied ground troops.
