The International Trade Commission today granted the Tandon Corporation's request for temporary relief against the Sony Corporation, the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Teac Corporation involving the importing of double-sided floppy disk drive products into the United States. Tandon lawyers said that the company expects the commission to order the Japanese companies to post bond for all domestic floppy disk-drive sales while a patent infringement case is pending.

Tandon filed the complaint in December. The commission could ultimately exclude Japanese floppy drive products, although analysts said that it was unlikely. A final decision in the case is expected by the end of the year. Tandon's patent applies to both 5 1/4-inch drives, the most popular in the market, and to 3 1/2-inch drives.

''This industry is being destroyed so quickly we had to ask for temporary relief,'' said Ranjit Sitlani, Tandon's vice president for corporate development.
