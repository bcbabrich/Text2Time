White House officials said today that aides to President Clinton had used the Presidential helicopter for their own purposes on a dozen occasions, but the announcement deemed legitimate all but one of the trips -- the outing to a golf course last week.

The list of 11 other flights disclosed by the White House today nevertheless raised new questions about the use of helicopters from the Presidential fleet. While most of the missions were described as training flights by White House military aides or officials from the White House military office, one was listed as a "classified" mission in which the passengers were Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Alice M. Rivlin, the deputy director of the Office and Management and Budget.

Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said the flight on April 14 was "in connection with their official duties," but she and other Administration officials refused otherwise to describe the purpose of the journey or say why the officials would be involved in a classified mission. New Procedures Adopted

In making public the new information, the White House said it had adopted new procedures to guard against further incidents of misuse like the golf outing last week that led to the forced resignation of David Watkins, the White House director of administration.
