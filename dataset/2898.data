It is one of the most arresting images ever made by a war photographer. A soldier is carried on a stretcher toward medical personnel who are calmly preparing to attend to his injuries. But the operating table, the gowned and masked nurses and surgeon, the stretcher carrier are all standing in water, and the operating room is enclosed in a mosquito-netting tent in the middle of a mangrove swamp. A nurse draws aside the flap of the tent, whose fluttery lines complement the delicate hanging tendrils and other vegetation. Natural light illuminates the table and hits the swirls of water around the approaching medic.

In haunting unreality and beauty, this picture surpasses Robert Capa's 1943 image of British surgeons working shirtless in a church in Sicily. Unlike Capa, who is internationally famous, Vo Anh Khanh is not much known even in his own country, Vietnam. He took the picture in 1970 in a Vietcong haven in the southern Mekong Delta, didn't think much of it and never printed it.

His image is one of more than 100 black-and-white photographs in ''Another Vietnam: Pictures of the War From the Other Side'' at the International Center of Photography. The exhibition, a collaboration with the National Geographic Society, offers a rare, comprehensive look at how Vietnamese photographers who found common cause with the Communists recorded the conflict.

Mr. Khanh, now in his early 60's, was one of 30 surviving war photographers whom Doug Niven, the show's curator, tracked down during more than 20 trips to Vietnam. An American news photographer, he began his search after he went to Cambodia in the early 1990's and saw handmade black-and-white postcards of the war.
