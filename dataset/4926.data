The birth of the modern triathlon seems to have taken place in 1974 when some members of the San Diego Track Club, trying to break the boring routine of training and racing, got together on Wednesday nights for a competition in which the contenders had to swim, bike and run. One of them, John Collins, took the idea to Hawaii, and the Ironman race was born.

It is a sport well suited to a fit, acquisitive, fashion-conscious era. ''There's no doubt that it's a narcissistic sport,'' says Mike Plant, the publisher of The Plant Report, a national triathlon newsletter. ''Runners always have that cadaverous look; you can run well and look like you're going to die any minute. A triathlete doesn't look like that. They look great; they get the upper body from swimming. Then there's the wild clothing that the sport has pioneered. It's sexy, and it's high tech.''

Triathlons can also be expensive. ''I've got a bike with three thousand bucks in it,'' says Shelley, ''and if something new comes along, I get it. I always carry two racing bikes and six sets of wheels for various road conditions. I've got four or five wet suits. I bought a big van just to carry my bikes around. I can repair a bike out of the back of my van. Every triathlete I know has one or more bike mechanics. Out of town, you've got hotel bills. Doctor bills too. Some people get ear problems. My E.N.T. guy told me to dry my ears with a hair blower to avoid ear canal infections.''

The sport also has its penny pinchers. ''I'm one of the cheapest triathletes you'll find,'' says Sally Taggart, a 24-year-old petroleum engineer with Chevron in Houston. ''My husband bought me a wet suit and some good wheels for my bike. I think I've spent about $1,000 on equipment, which is about as cheap as you can get.''

Such frugal ways have not hurt her performance. Last year at the national championships in Chicago, she was third among women in her age group and 10th overall among women amateurs. Taggart was talked into training for triathlons by her husband, Steve, himself a cyclist and water-polo enthusiast. Each week, during the winter, she swims almost five miles, cycles 60 miles and runs 40 miles. In the spring, when the race season resumes, she will increase her swimming and cycling distances.

''Being a triathlete has taught me discipline more than anything,'' she says. ''If you want to do that amount of training, you have to be really organized, use your time really effectively. Last summer, on top of the training, I was working 50 hours a week, and I have a 45-minute commute each way. The thing you realize is that everything you do has to be quality; it has to be that way with your job and your training. I run during the lunch hour at work. It's six miles, then a shower, then back in the office for a brown-bag sandwich at my desk.''

ACCORDING TO THE TRIATHLON Federation, 77 percent of those taking part in the sport last year were men, but the number of women participants is growing.
