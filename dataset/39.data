No one wants to be called a racist.

During Michael D. Cohen’s hearing before the House Oversight Committee this week, Representative Mark Meadows, a conservative Republican from North Carolina, was incensed when Rashida Tlaib, a freshman Democrat from Michigan, used the word “racist” to describe a bold move from Mr. Meadows during the hearing.

Mr. Meadows, who is white, summoned Lynne Patton, a black woman with ties to the Trump family, before the committee to defend the president’s character against charges of racism leveled by Mr. Cohen.

Ms. Patton, who is an official in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, stood silently and nodded while Mr. Meadows spoke on her behalf and presented her as proof of Mr. Trump’s good relationship with black people.
