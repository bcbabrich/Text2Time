This week’s guest blogger is Sarah — one name only, thanks — from the cooler-than-vous Paris store Colette. As the store’s creative director and buyer, Sarah is responsible for curating its pioneering mix of fashion, art, music and gadgetry, as well as for brokering the many collaborations that have made the Right Bank address an essential stop on the fashion map.

Yesterday was a typical day with many shows and appointments, but at the end of the day, there was nothing special to remember. Except, of course, Lapo Elkann receiving guests in his fabulous apartment on Invalides to present his new Italia Independent collection.

I’m very excited because today we get the new fluo Sever collection of sunglasses at Colette.

Then it was off to make our selection at Comme des Garçons. It’s funny because all the lip motifs remind me of the great girls T-shirt brand from NYC we work with, Married to the Mob.

I can’t resist giving you a little teaser of the sneaker we’re doing together, to be released in April. But, seriously, it’s amazing how lips are the new skulls: I see it everywhere! Think of the last Benjamin Cho collection, with a lipstick print by Dan Colen…

I also liked the new “perfecto-duvets” from Ganryu, the newest Comme protégé.

The finale at Sonia Rykiel was a riot of sequins. It’s so rare to see the models having fun on the catwalk.

We also checked out some cool accessories, including some cool accessories like these Christmas-ribbon brooches from Tatty Devine, disco ball keyrings from Ina Seifart, Hollywood Marylin Monroe earrings and necklaces from Atelier 11, and wallets from Paris House.

Last night, at Fendi, I don’t know what was scarier: the huge Bearbrick creature next to the editor Kappauf or the PETA protestors outside.

This week-end, I have more buying appointments, shows and plenty of parties. There is even a Yard Sale at Hotel Amour tomorrow afternoon.

if you’re in this neighborhood, don’t miss the carrot cake from Rose Bakery (46 rue des Martyrs).

On Sunday we’re installing displays for Supreme, Terry Richardson and a mysterious green frog window, as well as the new Acne gentleman’s jean made in collaboration with Fantastic Man magazine.

Thanks a lot to T and The New York Times for this week on The Moment. If you want to continue to follow my blog life, you can on Honeyee ) and Arkitip.
