UNITED STATES GYPSUM is back. Of course, its products were never gone, but the industrial company that made big profits in the mid-80's fell out of favor with many investors after 1988. That year, it borrowed $2.5 billion to pay the holder of each of its shares of stock a $42 dividend to ward off a takeover bid.

The debt, coupled with a steep drop in construction activity and lower demand for gypsum products, was too great a burden. In January 1991, USG, the holding company for United States Gypsum and other divisions that was created in a 1985 reorganization, defaulted on bond payments.

After taking two years or so to reorganize on a more solid financial footing, USG emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month minus $1.4 billion of debt. Interest charges were reduced to $170 million a year, from $320 million.

So far, the new company has not aroused much enthusiasm among investors. It began trading on May 21 at $11 a share on the New York Stock Exchange and closed Friday at $10. At that price, analysts say, the shares are a good value, even though the company is a long way from regaining its financial health of the early- and mid-80's.
