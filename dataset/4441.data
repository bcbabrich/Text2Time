IF reports of its death are greatly exaggerated, liberalism may be ailing in New York City because of shifts in a sensitive sociological index: the ratio between condos and condoms.

A larger proportion of New Yorkers now own their homes or apartments than at any time in the 20th century. And owners, rendered less mobile physically and less liquid fiscally by their stakes in real estate, tend to be more politically conservative than renters. Liberal leadership also has been diluted by divisions between black and Hispanic politicians and between white liberals and blacks and by the ascendancy of white liberals in the political establishment.

As the share of property owners has grown, the city has been riven by conflicts over what are loosely described as traditional social values -- values that have been put to the test as government usurped New Yorker's personal prerogatives by making condoms available to public school students, teaching tolerance and acceptance of gay and lesbian life styles, and ordering that a gay and lesbian group be allowed to march behind its own banner in the St. Patrick's Day parade.

That those decisions have provoked a vocal backlash could mean several things: the group that once proclaimed itself the silent majority has found its voice again; the group is not a majority at all but has just become louder for the time being than other minorities; New York's reputation for liberalism, like the reports of its demise, has been greatly exaggerated, a possibility raised by the conflicts that culminated in last month's 4-to-3 vote by the Board of Education to dismiss Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, or it could mean all of the above.
