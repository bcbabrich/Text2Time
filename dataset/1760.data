The Richard Prince exhibition “Spiritual America,” which was planned to open Thursday at the Tate Modern museum in London, was withdrawn Wednesday, following a warning from Scotland Yard that its inclusion of a nude photograph of Brooke Shields taken when she was 10 years could violate obscenity laws, The Guardian reported. The exhibition was to be shown as part of the gallery’s program Pop Life: Art in a Material World, but was closed off from display after newspaper reviews of the exhibition drew the attention of the Metropolitan police. The photograph, which was included in “Spiritual America” when it was shown at the Guggenheim Museum in 2007, was taken by Mr. Prince from another that photograph was made by Gary Gross in 1976 and authorized by Ms. Shields’s mother. Scotland Yard told The Guardian that the actions of its officers were “common sense.” A spokeswoman for the Tate Modern said that the display had been “temporarily closed down” and that the catalog for the exhibition had been withdrawn from sale.
