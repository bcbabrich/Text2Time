“WHEN a man buys a horse,” said Mike Ryba, “he takes mighty good care of him. The man knows he has an investment to protect and so he turns that horse over to trainer, groom, stablehands and exercise boys. But big league ball clubs are much too careless with their investments. They sink millions of dollars into bonus players, their stars of the future, and send them to the minors where one man, the manager, has to be everything to everybody.”

Mike is normally a placid individual but there was a faint trace of bitterness in his voice as he talked in St. Petersburg a week or so ago. He is nearing the end of a temporary scouting assignment with the St. Louis Cardinals and would love to latch on with some ball club in any capacity. He has matchless qualifications, too, because of his remarkable versatility.

A slugging first baseman for St. Francis College of Loretto, Pa., he was signed by the Cards in 1925 as a catcher. He finished his big league career in 1946 when he pitched for the Red Sox in the World Series. He has played every position on the diamond and is the only man in history who ever pitched and caught in both major leagues.

“Last year I managed Cedar Rapids for the Reds,” said Mike. “But the minors keep shrinking. Bill DeWitt told me he liked my work, but he was forced to cut down. I had 35 kids out there and I could only suit up 19. So the other 16 had to sit in the stands during games. I would have the 16 at the ball park every morning for practice. When we went on the road, I'd leave the 16 in charge of the oldest.
