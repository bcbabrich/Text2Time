Earlier this year, as Cory Booker was hustling around Newark, building support for his mayoral campaign, Ronald L. Rice could only twiddle his thumbs, waiting to see if Mayor Sharpe James would announce his decision not to run.

After Mayor James did, and Mr. Rice made his belated entry into the race in late March, it took another three weeks for him to win an endorsement, of sorts, from the mayor, who promised to work “very hard” for his ally and former deputy mayor.

But finally, tonight, a breakthrough: Mayor James will appear at a rally to endorse Mr. Rice and his slate of municipal council candidates. The candidates, running collectively as “The Home Team,” include four incumbents and the mayor’s son, John James, who is running for a seat in the South Ward.

Mr. Rice’s campaign office publicized the long-awaited joint appearance with all the gusto of a boxing promoter gearing up for a major fight, distributing flyers with an all-caps headline: “The Real Deal Wants The Rice.”

The event is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. today at the Tabu Lounge.
