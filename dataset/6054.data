ROME, June 2â€”Pope Paul VI today elevated his principal aide to cardinal, thus placing him among the candidates for the papacy.

The Pope appointed Archbishop Giovanni Benelli, known as the second most powerful official in the Vatican, the Archbishop of Florence. This post and his elevation to cardinal clearly put Monsignor Benelli among those mentioned as possible successors to the present Pontiff, who will be 80 years old in September.

Monsignor Benelli who is 56 years old, has served for 10 years as deputy secretary of state. This powerful post allowed him to screen appointments and papers for the Pope. This is the same job once held by Pope Paul under Pius XII.

Pope Paul was also moved from the job as deputy secretary of state to the post of Archbishop of Milan by Pope Pius. Such experience outside the Vatican is regarded as important for all papal candidates.
