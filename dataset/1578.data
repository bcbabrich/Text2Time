The Thread is an in-depth look at how major news and controversies are being debated across the online spectrum.

“It wasn’t fair, but it was necessary.” That comment about the Troubled Asset Relief Program, from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in April, seemed about the best that anyone would ever say of it. But with the program officially coming to an end on Sunday, some folks are pushing a different description: profitable.

“Even as voters rage and candidates put up ads against government bailouts, the reviled mother of them all — the $700 billion lifeline to banks, insurance and auto companies — will expire after Sunday at a fraction of that cost, and could conceivably earn taxpayers a profit,” reports The Times’s Jackie Calmes. “A final accounting of the government’s full range of interventions in the economy, including the bailouts of the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is years off and will most likely remain controversial and potentially costly. But the once-unthinkable possibility that the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program could end up costing far less, or even nothing, became more likely on Thursday with the news that the government had negotiated a plan with the American International Group to begin repaying taxpayers.”

So, was this weed actually an unloved flower? Well, it was certainly unloved. Even though it was enacted by President Bush and had bipartisan support, its passage helped end the careers of Republican politicians like Senator Robert F. Bennett. And while President Obama had no problem furthering the Bush agenda on this count, many liberals called it little more than a give-away to the banks. And it may go to the grave spurned despite the administration’s rosy new predictions.

Few political actions have been less popular than the bank bailout, but the White House wants voters to reconsider.

Here’s Chris in Paris at the liberal site Americablog: “Yes, it could have been much worse but doing a victory dance for the Bush-enacted program may be a bit much. The point that continues to escape Washington about the unpopular program is that people hate it because the bankers walked away with barely a scratch. Watching the architects of the crash stuff their pockets with obscene bonus money while everyone else either lost their job or worried about their future did not help.”



Steve Gilbert at the conservative site Sweetness & Light thinks the news could have been much better, especially if the program had followed the initial Bush administration vision: “TARP would have easily made a large profit if the Democrats and Mr. Obama had not insisted it include the GM and Chrysler bailout as well. And, besides bailing out Mr. Obama’s UAW constituents’ Cadillac pension plans, what good did it do?”

John R. Talbott of Huffington Post likewise shows no cheer:

Focusing solely on TARP and ignoring the other more costly portions of the government bailout of our biggest banks and corporations ignores the true cost of the government’s (both the Bush and Obama administrations, the Fed and Congress) inept response to this crisis. One of the reasons that TARP did not cost more was because of the government’s other more costly bailout policies, and to ignore them is to dramatically understate the true cost of the bailout.

Joe Weisenthal at Business Insider thinks those who applaud the new figures miss the bigger point:

With TARP winding down, there are plenty of folks in the media pointing out how the program “worked” and how the only money lost in the scheme was on the car companies (which really should never have been part of TARP) and not the banks. This is true, but remember, the financial industry rescue had two components: The TARP side and the monetary side — the aggressive reinflation of financial assets by the Fed. Unfortunately, this didn’t help the auto companies much. There’s no mark-to-myth for automakers, and the Fed can’t pump up the value of an automobile. If they could, we probably wouldn’t have lost much money on the car companies, either.

Such reactions frustrate Matt Yglesias to no end:

What other programs can you name that garned support from Nancy Pelosi and George W Bush, helped people millions of people, and had a negative cost to the government? And yet people think it’s horrible, in part because the public sphere has utterly failed to defend it … Hank Paulson devised a plan for asset purchases that almost certainly would have lost tons of money and possibly not stabilized the system. But in response to vigorous and well-informed criticism from a variety of quarters (with Paul Krugman playing a leading role I would say) he changed directions in favor of the equity injections that are giving us the negative-cost bank bailout we’re enjoying today. It became a lost opportunity for ideological instruction. Instead it’s become a moment of anti-instruction, which people think has demonstrated the lesson that the government consists of nothing but corrupt giveaways. It makes me sad.

Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal Constitution agrees about the “public sphere” part, arguing that the administration’s big mistake was failing to sell it politically:



President Obama made a crucial error in dealing with TARP, which he voted for as a U.S. Senator: He didn’t explain to the voters — constantly — why it was absolutely necessary to keep the financial system functioning. Without it, the banking system would have ground to a halt and the unemployment rate would have been much higher. Of course, Obama had no way to predict that Republicans would start to blame him for TARP or that voters would believe it.

However, it’s not just voters and Republicans who are blaming the current president for his dealings with his predecessor’s initiative. Simon Johnson, writing at The Times’s Economix blog, thinks there were three big mistakes:

First, there was no need to be so excessively generous to the financial executives (and their boards) at the institutions that had to be saved. In part this generosity was due to insufficient safeguards in the legislation (a point Ken Feinberg makes persuasively with regard to compensation), but mostly this was a choice insisted upon by key people in President Obama’s economic team … Second and closely related, the Obama administration missed the opportunity to change the structure and the incentives of Wall Street when it had the chance, at the very beginning of 2009. Third, by the time the administration put forward its financial reform ideas, the big banks were back on their feet – and ready to throw huge numbers of lobbyists and unlimited cash into the fight to preserve their right to take inordinate risk and to mismanage their way into disaster … In particular, there is nothing that ensures our biggest banks will be safe enough or small enough or simple enough so that in the future they cannot demand bailouts.

The end of TARP is also leading to contention over its role in the latest political upheaval. While some in the press insist that TARP has “has given rise to the Tea Party,” as the Atlantic’s Josh Green puts it, some from the right feel that’s revisionist history. Here’s Grim’s Hall:

Here’s their take: the engine of the Tea Partiers’ discontent was not the 2009 Stimulus Bill or GM bailout or ObamaCare. It was the 2008 TARP bill! But TARP was structured so that there was a good chance taxpayers would be paid back in full, and what do you know, that may actually be happening, in spite of all subsequent efforts to divert TARP paybacks to other social experiments … Alternate reality per my memory: conservatives were very queasy about TARP, but were just barely willing to tolerate it, because we were very afraid that an intense liquidity crunch would throw the financial system of the U.S. — if not the world — into chaos. We’d often wondered whether President Bush had genuinely conservative economic principles, but we at least believed he wouldn’t lie to us, and that he was advocating the best course according to his judgment and the judgment of his advisors. The bill was in fact structured so that taxpayers should be paid back, and there was a decent chance of that happening. So we held our nose and for the most part reluctantly supported our president. Then the new gang took over, and the worst part about TARP appeared to be not so much that it smelled like expensive crony capitalism, but that it opened the floodgates for massive new federal spending

Whether Grim is correct or not, it seems clear that support for TARP will remain a political liability. “One person who might especially wish he could change his vote on TARP is Sen. John Thune (R-SD).” adds Alex Seitz-Wald at Think Progress. “Thune is openly considering a White House bid in 2012, and will likely be the only GOP candidate to have voted for TARP — a serious liability when courting conservative primary voters. Recognizing this danger, Thune has tried to wriggle his way out of the vote. In an interview that will air Sunday on C-Span, Thune claims the Bush administration misled him, and accuses the Obama administration of turning the program into a ‘political slush fund.’ ”

It’s unclear if voters will buy Thune’s argument, but Seitz-Wald doesn’t:

Of course, Thune offers no evidence to support his claim that the program has become a “slush fund,” because there is none. His claim that Obama “expanded” the program is equally false. When Obama took office, the program was estimated to cost taxpayers $350 billion. That amount has steadily declined since, and is now projected to cost far less, if it ends up costing anything at all. And the philosophy behind the TARP hasn’t changed, so if it’s “wrong philosophically” today, why wasn’t it then?

Bloomberg’s Rebecca Christie worries that, at this point, anti-TARP politicians would only hurt the little guy:

Many candidates who won tough primaries are calling for TARP’s dissolution. House Republicans vow to cancel the program. Ending it now, however, would have little effect other than to deprive homeowners of getting help, now that TARP’s focus is shifting to managing the government’s investments, collecting repayments, and preventing home foreclosures. In reality, the program was pretty much shut down in July when Congress passed the financial regulation overhaul. That law bars new spending with TARP money and cuts the program to $475 billion, most of which has been committed.

And what about TARP’s swan song, the AIG deal. The aforementioned Josh Green is all for it:

The latest good news comes from one of the supervillains of the crisis, the giant insurer AIG, which required three separate bailouts totaling $182 billion … As the price of saving AIG, the government took it over. The Fed and the Treasury still have $130 billion in the company outstanding. But AIG is doing better. Its CEO predicts earnings of $6 billion to $8 billion this year. This week, Treasury will announce plans to begin the process of returning it to independence. At a plausible valuation of $60 billion (offered by an investment banker familiar with insurance companies) taxpayers could eventually recoup $55 billion. AIG will also soon divest itself of its US life-insurance unit, Alico, expected to fetch $25 billion or more in an initial public offering, and its Asian insurance operation, AIA, going to Prudential for $15.5 billion. Through the bailout, the government took on AIG’s toxic assets, which aroused a furor when counterparties like Goldman Sachs were paid off in full, even though they didn’t deserve to be. These assets, $21 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $24 billion of credit-default swaps, were placed in privately managed entities (essentially hedge funds) innocuously named Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III. Both have exceeded expectations: taxpayers should fully recoup their investment, along with a profit currently standing at $10 billion. It’s a good bet that the full sum doled out to AIG will eventually be returned.

To show how hard it’s going to be to sway the public that the AIG bailout was a good idea, consider this quote: “The rescue of AIG continues to have a poisonous effect on the marketplace. By providing a complete rescue that called for no shared sacrifice on the part of AIG and its creditors, the government fundamentally changed the rules of the game on Wall Street. As long as the biggest companies in America believe that you and I will bail them out, the worst effects of the AIG rescue will linger.”

Who said it? John Maggs of Politico has the answer: “The critic was not a Republican politician or some conservative think tank. It was Elizabeth Warren, President Barack Obama’s choice to set up the new agency that will protect consumers from financial system abuses, and her blunt assessment is shared to some extent by critics on the left and the right.”

And, as anyone who’s been following the reader comments on this this blog post can tell, if you’ve lost Elizabeth Warren, you’ve lost America.
