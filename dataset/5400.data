Several pounds of plaster molding dropped from a ceiling in Gov. William Donald Schaefer's office today, landing squarely on the chair where the Governor often works. Mr. Schaefer was in another office in the State House at the time. Mr. Schaefer's aides said the Governor could have been seriously injured if he had been at the desk. William Shipley, the building superintendent, said, ''We have a leak up there and it didn't help much.''
