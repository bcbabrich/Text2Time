“Pretty Woman,” a musical adaptation of the 1990 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts, will close in August after a year on Broadway, the show announced Wednesday.

With music and lyrics by the pop songwriters Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, the production was the latest effort to retool a hit movie for the stage. The show was capitalized for up to $17 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but after a strong start, the box office fell off considerably; the musical grossed $538,552 for the week ending June 30 — only 39 percent of its potentia l.

In a season that also included the adaptations of the movies “Beetlejuice” and “Tootsie,” “Pretty Woman,” which Jerry Mitchell directed, was harshly reviewed and didn’t pick up any Tony Award nominations. At the time of its Aug. 18 closing it will have played 27 previews and 421 regular performances.

From the start, the musical faced an especially knotty challenge: how to modernize the movie’s male-savior plot for a post-#MeToo audience. Could Vivian, the hooker with a heart of gold played by Ms. Roberts in the film, be the savior this time around? Despite the feminist gloss, the show still “hewed suffocatingly close to the film’s story, gags and dialogue,” Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The New York Times.
