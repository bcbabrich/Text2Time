Sergeant Stone, who received the reading material today, said he had only briefly ''caught sight'' of his fellow G.I.'s during his captivity.

Specialist Gonzales, who appeared more rested than the others, gave the most elaborate description of his condition. Responding to a question from Mr. Jackson, he said he was ''okay, considering the circumstances.'' He added that he is also feeling ''a little mentally drained.''

Mr. Jackson told him: ''You are a hero. People know you all over the world.''

In Washington, David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, reacted to the interview by praising Mr. Jackson, but then adding: ''We opposed his mission because we felt we couldn't protect his safety, and feared it would be misconstrued in Belgrade. It is positive that he was able to see the three soldiers, deliver messages from familes and verify their health. But there is no basis for their being taken and we continue to hold Mr. Milosevic responsible for their personal safety.''

A group of American Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders, some of whom had met with the soldiers' families, came from the United States with Mr. Jackson, but were barred by the Yugoslav authorities from meeting with them. They brought Bibles and small Eastern Orthodox icons for each man, as well as five packages of Chuckles candies for Sergeant Ramirez, a tape player and cassette tapes recorded by each of the men's families.

Mr. Jackson showed each of the soldiers the gifts, but the Yugoslav general, who would not identify himself, did not allow the soldiers to take the gifts, saying they had to pass military censors first.

To each of the servicemen, though, Mr. Jackson offered words of encouragement.

''So many view the jail experience as a time of reflection, a time to write, a time to think, a time to pray, a time to think about how they want to build their lives,'' he told Sergeant Stone, adding that his imprisonment could be an opportunity to strengthen his character and faith.

''Out of our scars,'' he said, ''come our stars.''

The men, members of the First Squadron, Fourth Cavalry of the First Infantry Division operating in Macedonia, were on patrol when they were captured at about 4 P.M. on March 31. The Government here has maintained that they were seized in Kosovo; American officials have accused the Serbs of abducting them.
