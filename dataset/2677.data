A federal appeals court has ruled that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which operates the transit system in Boston, violated the free speech rights of a group that advocates marijuana use by banning its advertisements four years ago. The court said the authority had engaged in "viewpoint discrimination" by rejecting three advertisements from the group, Change the Climate, as the agency did not have the right to reject advertisements because it disagreed with their content. The general manager of the authority, Michael H. Mulhern, said the agency did not allow the advertisements because it felt they were intended for children. Katie Zezima (NYT)
