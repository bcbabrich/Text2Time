Mr. Gellman's book will not convince everybody, but it is the solid, heavily documented sort of work that will have to be taken into account by serious people as the debate about Nixon continues.

It is a full-scale political biography of Nixon during his early career in politics. It is not a biography that adds a conspicuous store of new material to what has been presented by other writers over the years, from Garry Wills to Stephen E. Ambrose to Henry A. Kissinger. But in directing our attention to what he portrays as the anti-Nixon myth and its endurance, Mr. Gellman effectively joins the argument. At some point in almost every chapter he itemizes a few of the major allegations that have acquired the force of truth; then he tries to refute them.

The overall effect of this is persuasive enough to cause some reflection on the entrenchment of images in American political life, how a certain view of a figure, enhanced by an unquestioning acceptance of the putative facts of that figure's life, gains a kind of etched-in-stone validity. But some of Mr. Gellman's refutations are more persuasive than others. His detailed chapters on Nixon's defeat of the Democratic candidate, Jerry Voorhis, for Congress in 1946 addresses accusations that that Nixon was the handpicked choice of a cabal of monied conservative interests in Southern California, and that he underhandedly and falsely charged Voorhis with gaining endorsements from the political action committee of the Congress of Labor Organizations, which at that time was viewed as Communist-affiliated.

Mr. Gellman shows that the California committee that approached the young Nixon to run for election in the state's 12th Congressional District was not a bunch of professional dirty-tricksters but an ordinary, non-nefarious group of Republican activists. They were, in Mr. Gellman's description, doing nothing more than what many other groups of interested citizens, Democratic and Republican, have done for decades. As for the famous C.I.O.-political action committee connection, Mr. Gellman shows that Voorhis did receive such endorsements, endorsements that the candidate himself found troubling and had sought to keep quiet.

An impressive element of Mr. Gellman's thorough research is that he is able to pinpoint when certain anti-Nixon myths were born and how they have been repeated over the decades. In the Voorhis case, they began with a 1952 article in The New Republic by Ernest Brashear, an unsuccessful candidate for the California State Assembly. Among other things, Brashear wrote of legions of Nixon supporters' making anonymous phone calls to voters accusing Voorhis of being a Communist. Mr. Gellman finds no evidence that any such dirty trick took place.
