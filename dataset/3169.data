In an effort to increase public participation in policy decisions regarding the Internet's address system, two groups released reports this week with recommendations on how best to involve individuals in policy matters.

The first report, released on Monday, was drafted by a committee appointed by the organization that oversees the address system, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as Icann. The goal of the committee was to make recommendations to Icann on how to involve global Internet users in its activities, a task stipulated in its charter when Icann was created by the Commerce Department to take over management of the address system.

Since its inception, Icann has been criticized for a lack of public participation, particularly as the organization has moved into what is perceived as more of a policy-making role on issues like adding new extensions to the Internet's pool of addresses. Recently, criticism has centered on the introduction of the .biz and .info extensions to relieve crowding in .com.

To address these criticisms, the committee appointed to study the issue, known as the At-Large Study Committee, issued a proposal outlining how Icann should establish a group within the organization representing individual users, which would in turn elect six directors to Icann's board.
