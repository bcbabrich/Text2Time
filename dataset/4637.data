To the Editor:

"Sister Souljah Is No Willie Horton" (editorial, June 17) indicates that Sister Souljah was calling for violence against whites and praises Gov. Bill Clinton for condemning her statement in a speech to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.

In the same issue, "Rapper, Chided by Clinton, Calls Him a Hypocrite" (news article) indicates that Sister Souljah's statement was in response to a "question about the views of those who committed the violence":

"Did they think it was wise? Was that wise, reasoned action?"

While Sister Souljah's answer may not have been artful, it is clear that she was attempting to convey the thinking of those who committed the violence in Los Angeles, who thought nothing of killing blacks or whites.

I am fearful that you did what so many white Americans, including Mr. Clinton, do when it comes to remarks made by blacks in not examining the context of the statement and jumping to the conclusion that this is another black calling for violence against whites.

Your editorial also indicates that many black elected officials rallied to Mr. Clinton's support. However, note that Representative Charles Rangel of New York interpreted Mr. Clinton's action "as a way to court white voters." I am sure that the average black voter will agree.
