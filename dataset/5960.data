DETROIT (AP) - A single by Lynn Jones in the 12th inning scored Mick Kelleher with the winning run for Detroit.

The game-winning hit was the fourth for Jones in six at-bats.

Champ Summers led off the 12th with a pinch-hit single. Kelleher, running for Summers, went to second when Reggie Cleveland, the Milwaukee pitcher, threw a wild pitch. Kelleher moved to third on Lou Whitaker's sacrifice bunt and scored on Jones's single. Jones made the winning hit for the second day in a row.

Dave Rozema (3-4) the fourth Tiger pitcher, worked the last two innings to gain the victory. Cleveland (2-1) entered the game after the Milwaukee starter, Randy Lerch, went 10 innings.
