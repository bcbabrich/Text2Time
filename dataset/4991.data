The police are searching for a retired correction officer and college classmate of Vander L. Beatty in connection with the fatal shooting of the former State Senator in his campaign headquarters in Brooklyn on Thursday.

A blue Oldsmobile registered to Arthur E. Flourney, 51 years old, of 465 Brooklyn Avenue in the Flatbush section, fit the description of the vehicle the police said the gunman used after he left Mr. Beatty's office at 457 Sterling Place in the Prospect Heights section. The vehicle stalled and the police found it three blocks from the shooting. The police would only say they wanted to question Mr. Flourney and declined to call him a suspect.

On the advice of Mr. Beatty, Mr. Flourney had hired Harry R. Pollak as his lawyer because he wanted to decrease his alimony payments. Mr. Pollak, who was also Mr. Beatty's lawyer, said Mr. Flourney was upset Thursday when Judge Martin Schneier denied the motion in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn . Afterward, Mr. Pollak said, Mr. Flourney assaulted him at 12:40 P.M. The police said Mr. Beatty was shot about 45 minutes later.

''He seemed a strange person,'' Mr. Pollak said. ''Before yesterday's thing, I told him I was going to withdraw from the case.''
