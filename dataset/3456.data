''I just want to do the best I can to help this organization win and, more importantly, try to build character,'' Ward said. ''Leadership in the locker room, off the court. That type of thing. And that's what God has called us to do as a disciple.''

From the moment the former Heisman Trophy winner at Florida State University arrived in New York City, Ward made his religious convictions clear. He carried around a Bible and attended pre-game chapel services with teammates. Last season, he helped institute a team prayer at midcourt after games and began wearing a cloth bracelet that read ''W.W.J.D.'' -- for What Would Jesus Do? This season, he has been more upfront than ever about his greater intentions: he is not playing merely to win a championship.

Thoughtful about his beliefs, Ward stands firm about his convictions regarding life style and popular culture. If those convictions rise to a level of angering management and inviting more criticism, he is resigned to pressing on with his cause.

''That's why God placed me here,'' Ward said during an hourlong interview before the Bible study last week. ''I never imagined myself being in New York. It took me a while to understand what his sole purpose for me being here was. First and foremost, it was to get the message across through the way I live and my life style. And also to be challenged by everyone: the press, teammates, coaching staff, everyone.''

Team officials and teammates have always been guarded in talking publicly about Ward and the impact of his beliefs and advocacy. And those officials and players declined to be identified by name when asked to talk about Ward for this article. But a number of them expressed a concern that Ward's insistent outspokenness had become something of a distraction for him and the team.

In particular, they are uneasy with Ward's comments earlier this season regarding God favoring the Knicks because of their faith. Dave Checketts, president of Madison Square Garden, said he spoke to Ward about proselytizing in the locker room.

Van Gundy said he appreciated the religious notes Ward had given him. ''I think one's religion is a deeply personal issue and a private thing and I think that everyone has their beliefs, and they practice them accordingly,'' Van Gundy said. ''But I am convinced whichever God you worship, he takes no side at a sporting event. He doesn't favor any team.''
