The Brooklyn District Attorney's office announced yesterday that it was seeking to bring criminal charges against Nushawn J. Williams for any role he might have played in infecting girls or women in Brooklyn with the virus that causes AIDS. Investigators with the District Attorney's office have begun posting signs in Mr. Williams's old neighborhoods in an effort to get potential victims to come forward.

Mr. Williams, who turns 21 today, has been accused by state health officials of having unprotected sex with dozens of girls here and in western New York State, knowing all the while that he was carrying the potentially deadly virus. Officials believe that at least 10 people have been infected with H.I.V. through contact with Mr. Williams or one of his sexual partners, and they say that number could grow substantially.

''We are looking to build a criminal case against Nushawn Williams,'' said Dennis Hawkins, a deputy district attorney in Brooklyn. ''If victims make complaints, we could pursue charges from reckless endangerment to assault to attempted murder.''

The Bronx District Attorney's office is also investigating reports that Mr. Williams might have infected a high school student in that borough.
