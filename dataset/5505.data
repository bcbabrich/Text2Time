CRAFTS IN PHILADELPHIA

The 11th annual Philadelphia Craft Show will be held from Thursday through Sunday at the 103d Engineers' Armory on 33d Street just north of Market.

Exhibits are scheduled to include jewelry, ceramics, glass, wood, fiber, basketry, quilts, leather, metal and handmade paper.

A symposium, ''Jewelry as a Craft,'' will be held at 11 A.M., Thursday in the Stein Auditorium at Drexel University, directly opposite the Armory. Admission to the symposium, which includes admission to the craft show, is $15.
