Re the Senior Class column on Jan. 18, "Inside Prison, Too, a Population Is Aging":

Although Gary Hilton, assistant commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections, is quoted by Robert W. Stock as saying "old doesn't mean nice," I would say that a more accurate statement would be that old does not necessarily mean nice. I have met several older and younger inmates active in the horticultural program at the Graterford, Pa., state prison who are fine people that I would be proud to have as friends and neighbors.

While I personally think that lifers who have reformed their lives in prison should be eligible for commutation, care must be taken that the high cost of caring for elderly inmates is not used as an excuse to send them out when they are vulnerable and needy.

Today, when it appears that fewer and fewer Americans consider it important to be their brother's keeper, it could be argued that many aging lifers would be better off being kept in prison, assuming humane conditions, than released, if release is into poverty, with no job prospects. Being set free when frail and needy could ultimately be a punishment more cruel than life imprisonment.
