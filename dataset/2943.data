Political surveys suggest the issue has not become a major concern for most New Yorkers. Indeed, some drivers, like Dr. Jonathan Epstein, an emergency medical specialist in Manhattan, seem to be taking the price increases with a shrug. ''If it goes up,'' he said, ''there's very little I can do about it. I have to have a car and I have to have insurance.''

But Abby Scala, an account executive at Kay Insurance Associates, one of the biggest brokers for auto and home insurance in metropolitan New York, said lots of other customers are beginning to rebel.

''My phone hasn't been this busy in 25 years,'' she said. ''Almost everyone is calling when they get their renewal notices, asking us to shop around for better prices.''

Most customers, she said, do not see auto insurance as a political problem, however. ''They blame the insurance companies,'' she said. ''They don't even think about the Legislature or the governor.''

Just across the Hudson River, prices in New Jersey have been the highest in the country for several years and have been a big factor in recent gubernatorial elections. The latest data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an umbrella group of state regulators, put the average annual cost of insuring a car in New Jersey at $1,034 in 1999, $91 more than in New York and $351 more than the national average.

But Mr. Hartwig said that with prices declining in New Jersey as they are rising in New York, New York is likely soon to take the title of most expensive state. It may already have done so, he said; the statistics run two years behind the calendar, with the next report, for calendar year 2000, expected in mid- to late June.

Those figures will probably show New Jersey still in the lead because fraud costs were not significantly reflected in coverage prices in New York until 2001, Mr. Hartwig said. He estimated the average cost of insuring a car in New York in 2001 was $1,080, or $100 more than in New Jersey. But that is not official. And the headlines that come with becoming No. 1 may make a big difference politically.
