Alice Provensen, who illustrated and often wrote books for children for more than a half-century, helping young readers learn about animals and aviators, poems and presidents, Aesop’s fables and Chinese legends, died on April 23 in San Clemente, Calif. She was 99.

Her daughter, Karen Provensen Mitchell, with whom she had lived since 2008, confirmed the death.

For almost 40 years, Ms. Provensen formed half of an illustrating team that was famous in the world of children’s books. Her husband, Martin, was the other half. Together they illustrated dozens of books for young and very young readers, beginning in the 1940s, and as their careers advanced they wrote many as well.

After Mr. Provensen died in 1987, Ms. Provensen was hesitant to continue her career.

“When Martin died,” she told Publishers Weekly, “at first I didn’t think I would ever be able to work again.”

But her daughter and an editor friend encouraged her, and she continued to write and illustrate into this decade.
