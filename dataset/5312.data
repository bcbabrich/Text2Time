Mr. Jackson was also upset that a national voter registration program to which he thought Mr. Dukakis had agreed at the Atlanta convention was ''not in place'' and that Mr. Dukakis did not consult with him before his speech to a civil rights rally here Saturday.

''What was missing in the speech,'' Mr. Jackson said in an interview with The New York Times, ''was he didn't mention D.C. statehood or set-asides or registration.'' He expressed a similar complaint on the ABC program. A Delicate Relationship

All along, the Dukakis campaign has sought an arms-length relationship with Mr. Jackson, hoping his supporters will turn out for Mr. Dukakis but concerned that many white voters might be turned off if Mr. Jackson appears too close to the ticket. A certain amount of discord with Mr. Jackson has not been unwelcome in the Dukakis camp.

Members of Mr. Dukakis's staff said they had conducted polling of Mr. Jackson's standing among voters in various states. Among the states Mr. Jackson was asked to steer clear of were Alabama, Mississippi and Michigan, except for Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Jackson advisers said. Mr. Jackson was also asked not to campaign for Mr. Dukakis in New York, where Mr. Jackson has been stumping for the last three days, or in Texas, the advisers said.

Jack Corrigan, director of Mr. Dukakis's campaign operations, said a tentative schuedule for Mr. Jackson's fall campaigning on behalf of the ticket had been agreed to. In drafting it, he said, the priorities were picking places that ''make electoral sense'' and where there were large numbers of unregistered voters. ''Nobody ever said don't go someplace,'' Mr. Corrigan said.

''I'm serving as a rather faithful volunteer,'' Mr. Jackson said. Had he expected more of a policy role? ''At this point, the policy makers for the most part are operating out of Boston,'' he replied. ''I accept my role as a volunteer for the campaign. Some people want to be more connected than they are. But that's up to the campaign. That's the campaign's responsibility and its challenge.'' Strains Partly Personal

The strains between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Dukakis's campaign, Mr. Jackson's advisers said, are both personal and political. Politically, Mr. Jackson feels the Dukakis campaign is forsaking other constituencies through its intense focus on winning the support of moderate whites, many of them Democrats, who defected to Ronald Reagan in the past two elections. ''This obsession with retrieving Reagan Democrats,'' Mr. Jackson said, ''is leaving a bird in the hand unnurtured while pursuing birds in the Quayle.''
