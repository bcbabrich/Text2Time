When city inspectors started giving letter grades for cleanliness to restaurants a year ago, restaurant owners were not pleased.

The grades, which must be posted in a prominent location visible from the street, were accompanied by strict standards that resulted in greater fines for owners. And even the first restaurant in the city to receive an A, Spark’s Deli in Queens, was required to pay $800 for violations that included a cashier drinking coffee in an area where it was not permitted.

Many restaurant owners worried that any grade but an A would ruin their business — the two other passing grades are B and C.

But a year into the program, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday stood outside Spark’s, an unassuming sandwich place in Long Island City, Queens, and proclaimed the letter-grading system a success. “Our restaurant rating system is definitely making the grade with customers and with owners alike,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “It provides restaurantgoers with information that’s really important to them and that they really appreciate.”

Mr. Bloomberg also said that the system had been good for business. There are about 24,000 restaurants in New York City, 90 percent of which have been inspected so far. Of those, 69 percent have received A grades, according to a statement from the mayor’s office.

The high percentage of restaurants earning the highest grade was evidence that restaurants that had initially received a B or a C had improved on follow-up inspections or had successfully appealed lower grades, said Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the city’s health commissioner. “The point is that all these restaurants are improving and that’s exactly what we were trying to accomplish when we set up the system in the first place,” Dr. Farley said. “New York City is known for its world-class restaurants. With this new system, we’ll also be known as the city with the safest restaurants.”

For those restaurants that earned top marks, a good grade can translate into more business, Mr. Bloomberg said. He cited a recent study conducted for the city by Baruch College that found that a high percentage of diners surveyed considered grades when deciding where to eat.

Mr. Bloomberg also noted a change made to the system six months ago that eliminated fines for restaurants that earn A grades on a first inspection. That waiver saved 8,000 restaurants about $3 million in fines, he said.

“This is going to be an economic incentive, and encourage behavior,” Dr. Farley said of the waiver. “We saw we were getting an increase in fines, which wasn’t the goal of the program.”

But some restaurant owners and trade groups consider the inspection system discriminatory and expensive. Andrew Rigie, executive vice president of the New York City chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, said that the revised system of waiving fines for establishments with an initial A grade still burdens those restaurants that earn an A through the appeal process.

And restaurants with B’s and C’s are likely to lose customers who pay attention to the letter grades, even if they are still fit to eat in, Mr. Rigie said. With the combination of court fees and multiple inspections, the system is more expensive and onerous than ever, he added.

“The city needs to move away from a model of levying millions of dollars on small business owners and shaming local restaurant owners,” Mr. Rigie said.

At Manducatis, a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant in Long Island City and a Queens institution, the manager, Anthony Cerbone, said that an initial grade of B, for an espresso machine positioned too far from a sink, scared off some customers and made loyalists shrug and ask, “What’s with the B?”

The restaurant received an A in a follow-up inspection, but Mr. Cerbone said the inspections were expensive and disruptive, with inspectors staying for hours during lunchtime rushes.

Still, whatever the debate over the new letter-grade system, receiving an A appears to be worth it. The survey by Baruch College, which was conducted by telephone and was paid for with a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that 70 percent of New Yorkers surveyed reported noticing the grades in the windows. And of those, 88 percent considered them when deciding where to eat.

As she looked for a restaurant with a friend in Koreatown in Manhattan, Amie Kreisberg, 44, of the Upper West Side, said she took the grades into consideration. The B at a nearby barbecue place was “definitely a deterrent,” she said. “Even if we had a reservation, if we walked in and saw a bad grade, I wouldn’t go in.”

Instead, she scanned the menu of another nearby barbecue restaurant, Kum Gang San.

“What’s the letter?” she asked her friend.

“A.”

And in they went.
