To enter the competition, of which Ilona Copen is executive director and Igor Youskevitch is artistic director, dancers had to prepare a piece of choreography that was assigned to them. During the judging, they could also perform a solo of their own choice. Once in New York, they learned additional repertory - which had not been previously announced -and they rehearsed this repertory with special instructors appointed by the competition's directors. This format was devised to prevent the competition from becoming merely a display of dancers doing their favorite steps.

Like similar competitions in Europe, the New York competition focuses international attention on talented young dancers, and participants are often offered positions with ballet companies. Among the contestants in the 1984 competition was Alexandre Proia, now a well-regarded member of the New York City Ballet. Other dancers in that competition have joined such companies as the San Francisco Ballet, Boston Ballet, the Basel Ballet and the National Dance Company of Mexico.

However, there are things that competitions may not reveal. Because no contestants are seen in complete ballets, one cannot necessarily tell whether they can be convincing in a role from beginning to end. And because they present only solos and duets, one may not get a sense of how they would interact on stage with an ensemble.

Just as competitions cannot reveal everything about a dancer, so a gala concert may not indicate why certain dancers receive one kind of medal and others do not, for contestants are judged on overall excellence and not on their performances of a single work.

This program, in which both the medalists and other contestants participated, included items from the standard repertory and some of the solos the dancers performed during the judging sessions. Mr. Guerra was amazing for his leaps and bounding footwork in an excerpt from Pierre Lacotte's version of ''La Sylphide.'' And he was dignified partnering Miss Cassano in the ''Nutcracker'' pas de deux.
