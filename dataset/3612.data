Dr. George H. Hitchings, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988 for pharmaceutical research that led to the creation of drugs to treat leukemia, gout, malaria and disorders of the human immunity system and that eventually made organ transplants possible, died on Friday morning at his home. He was 92 and lived in Chapel Hill, N.C.

He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Thomas E. Hitchings.

For more than 33 years, Dr. Hitchings was the chief researcher and biochemist with the Burroughs Wellcome Company in Research Triangle Park, N.C. (now Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C.). For most of his career he worked closely with Dr. Gertrude Elion, and their work led to the development of important drugs such as AZT, used to treat AIDS.

The two joined forces in 1944. At the time, drug research was done on a trial-and-error basis. But Dr. Hitchings and Dr. Elion developed compounds for specific diseases, testing them in vitro and in animals, then watching for unexpected results. They perfected one new compound after another, shedding light on a variety of diseases afflicting humanity.

Their work was monumental, but because they were industry scientists, they were often overlooked by the Nobel Committee. Considered by many scientists to be the founders of the field of chemotherapeutics, they were eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine, nearly 30 years after most of their discoveries.
