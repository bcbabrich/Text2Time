Forget waxed mustaches, plaid thermoses and suspenders. The new men’s-wear label Jon Ashe is bringing back a sleeker and more understated version of heritage chic. “You have to strike a balance between being innovative and tribal,” says Jonas Hegewisch, who designs the fledgling collection. His idea of “tribal” doesn’t include far-flung ethnic influences. He’s talking about belonging to a social “tribe,” as in Williamsburg hipsters or corporate America. “The aesthetic that appeals to me has a certain rustic quality,” explains Hegewisch, who is originally from Germany. (Before starting Jon Ashe, he collaborated with his wife Ursula on Wearkstatt, a fashion-forward bridal business; he also owned Trailer Park, one of Berlin’s coolest biergartens.) “But I try to bring different elements together.”

Those elements include formal suiting and vintage worker‘s uniforms. Meticulously tailored but stripped of all padding, the Jon Ashe look is perhaps best described as falling somewhere between dandy and 1930s construction worker. All of the garments are produced in New York City; the high-end fabrics are sourced from small mills in Britain (tweed), Italy (cashmere) and Japan (cotton). Horn buttons come from Austria and custom-made leather belts are from Ohio.

But the real strength of the collection lies in the precise but easy-to-wear silhouettes. “Being comfortabIe puts you in a better mood,” Hegewisch says. “I spend a lot of time looking at people to see what makes them look happy. Happy people are more attractive.” It only makes sense then that Jon Ashe, a bohemian who doubles as the designer’s alter ego (the name is derived from the first letters of Hegewisch’s own), is the happiest man of all. The imaginary muse is a Vespa-riding Brooklyner whose enviable life consists of cruising around the New York harbor in his small yacht, sipping artisanal cocktails and playing drums in a “frock band” (a style yet to be defined). “It’s the life I hope to have one day if my collection takes off,” Hegewisch says. “So he’s a motivation as well as an inspiration.”

At the end of September Mr. Ashe will get his very own headquarters. Hegewisch is currently putting the finishing touches on a flagship store on the corner of Grand and Crosby Streets. The store — a chic man-cave with felt-upholstered walls and broken-in furniture — will feature the full Jon Ashe line as well as luggage, shoes, vintage hiking canes and meticulously stirred cocktails. “It will be like my living room,” Hegewisch promises, “only better.”
