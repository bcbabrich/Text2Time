West Virginia's plan to decline a New Year's Day Cotton Bowl invitation and accept a bid from the more lucrative Sugar Bowl may yet encounter some resistance. Troy Mathieu, executive director of the Sugar Bowl, said yesterday that his game would consider selecting once-beaten Notre Dame over the undefeated Mountaineers if the final regular-season polls next Sunday give his game a choice before the Cotton Bowl gets to select.

That possibility is remote because Florida would have to defeat Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game on Saturday by a margin wide enough -- and convincing enough to voters -- to overcome a three-place, 373-point deficit to Texas A&M in the combined polls used in the bowl selection process.

Texas A&M, the Southwest Conference champion and host team in the Cotton Bowl, is in seventh place with 2,385 points in the combined total of the Associated Press media poll and the CNN/USA Today poll of coaches. Florida is 10th with 2,012 points. In the likely event that A&M remains ahead of Florida in the combined polls next Sunday, the Cotton Bowl would have the second choice, after the Orange Bowl invites second-ranked Florida State to meet No. 1 Nebraska.

"If we have the opportunity, I don't think it's any secret that the Cotton Bowl this year would like to invite the highest-rated team to play Texas A&M," said Rick Baker, the game's executive director. Based on the combined poll this week, that team should be third-place West Virginia.
