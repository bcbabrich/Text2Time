THE VOTERS

MANY STAYED AT HOME -- The front-loading last spring of the presidential primaries combined with the long-term trend of increased voter apathy to drive down voter turnout to near historic lows. A new analysis by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonpartisan group, shows that only 17.7 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in states where both the Republican and Democratic parties held presidential primaries. That was the second-lowest turnout in primaries in 40 years, and a mere 0.8 percentage points above the 16.9 percent of voters who took part in the 1996 primaries. Steven A. Holmes (NYT)

THE REPUBLICANS

A TEST FOR CHENEY -- Pop quizzes, more often than not, spell troubles for politicians. So the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, looked vaguely concerned when he got one yesterday morning as he walked into a classroom full of 6-year-olds in an elementary school in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. His task, explained the teacher, Rosalyn Robinson, was to guess which solution an egg would float in: corn starch, food coloring or salt. was to guess which solution an egg would float in: corn starch, food coloring or salt. Mr. Cheney chose salt, and as he dropped eggs into cups filled with each solution, he was borne out. ''Just don't ask me to spell potato,'' he said, referring to another quiz met with less success by Dan Quayle, another Republican vice-presidential candidate. Michael Cooper (NYT)

NATURAL LAW PARTY

2 NOMINATIONS, 1 CANDIDATE -- John Hagelin, already the presidential nominee of a rump faction of the Reform Party, was chosen yesterday to also be the nominee of another small, independent political group, the Natural Law Party. Mr. Hagelin, an Iowa physicist and founder of the Natural Law Party, said in accepting the second nomination that he would run under both party banners. He was named the nominee of the Reform Party faction last month when that party split, with its hard-right members nominating Patrick J. Buchanan. The Natural Law Party's nominating convention was held in Alexandria, Va., attended by 400 people. The Natural Law Party hews to the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the transcendental meditation leader, and promotes preventive health care, increased use of renewable energy sources and peaceful remedies for international conflicts.

THE AD CAMPAIGN

WITHDRAWN AD RUNS -- Last week, the Republican National Committee announced that it would not go through with plans to run a television advertisement that challenged the veracity of Vice President Al Gore. It conceded the advertisement could be considered misleading and notified stations that had received advanced copies of it not to broadcast it. But on Wednesday, the ad began running anyway in New Orleans after a technician at the local CBS affiliate pushed the wrong button. The advertisement included an excerpt from a 1994 television interview in which Mr. Gore said he could not think of a single lie told by President Clinton. It did not mention that the interview took place before Mr. Clinton met Monica Lewinsky. Officials at the New Orleans station, WWL-TV, said the advertisement was pulled after several viewers complained. But Gore campaign officials are not complaining; several had said last week they hoped it would run, to create a backlash against Gov. George W. Bush.
