Sufficiently healthy to resume his career, Tim Raines is returning to the Yankees.

The Yankees, with whom Raines played three seasons, made no announcement yesterday, but a friend of Raines said the team had invited the outfielder to spring training with the prospect of winning a job and gaining a $400,000 salary.

Raines's 19th major league season, his first with Oakland, was cut short last year after he went on the disabled list July 19 with a kidney inflammation. He was subsequently found to have lupus, an autoimmune disease that affects joints and can affect internal organs. Despite the ailment, Raines was eager to continue his career.

Raines waited, his friend said, to make sure his medical reports were good, and when he found they were, his agent, Adam Katz, proceeded to work out a deal with the Yankees.

If Raines wins a backup outfield or designated hitter position with the Yankees, he will play at the age of 40. He has often said he would like to play on a team with his son, Tim Jr., who is in the Baltimore organization. The younger Raines played for the Delmarva (Md.) Shorebirds in the Class A South Atlantic League last season, his second as a professional, batting .248 and leading the organization in stolen bases with 49.
