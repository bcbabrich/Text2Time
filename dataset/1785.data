Thomas Jefferson was homeless for 12 years on the streets of Philadelphia after returning as a combat veteran from the battlefields of Iraq. “When I came home, I was messed up,” he said. Mr. Jefferson struggled with substance abuse and had a stroke, ending up in a wheelchair. Now 45, he lives less than a mile from where the man who became the third president drafted the Declaration of Independence. The modern-day Jefferson is pictured in the Assembly Room of Independence Hall, where the document was adopted on July 4, 1776.

The Times is presenting portraits of those who share presidential names. We’re also looking for young Barack Obamas. If you know of one in the New York area, please contact Patrick Witty.

George Washington: Our first president. And a man from the Lower East Side, burdened with that name, who rejoiced in last year’s election. “I never thought that a black man could become president. Watching him brought tears to my eyes.”

John Quincy Adams: Our sixth president did not leave behind much of a popular impression; certainly not on the 87-year-old pastor in Bedford-Stuyvesant who shares the name and believes his own life has been equally fruitful.

Ulysses Grant: Our 18th president was a man of great perseverance. Having a name that could easily be rendered “Useless” or “Grunt” by taunting friends also calls for perseverance. And some anger management classes.

Calvin Coolidge: Our 30th president and his very distant relation in upstate New York obviously share a passion for rural life, but Calvin Coolidge was famously pictured with a horse, while Calvin Coolidge favors alpacas. In fact, he raises them.

John F. Kennedy: Our 35th president was known for the charm he could exert. However, the Long Island accountant said: “I didn’t really have a lot of luck with the girls because of the name. And you’d figure with Irish girls it would be easy.”

Richard Nixon: Our 37th president was tormented. The retired Atlantic City firefighter found that the name made him the subject of many jokes over 30 years in the firehouse. But the humor never got too vicious or mean spirited.

Ronald Reagan: Ronald Reagan of Syracuse was presumably named after the 40th president, but about a decade before that other Reagan entered the political arena. Mr. Reagan says he doesn’t mind the name. His son, Ronald, feels differently.
