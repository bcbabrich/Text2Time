Last October, anticipating a new round of military base closings, Air Force analysts used a computer to estimate how much the Defense Department would save if it closed its high-tech military laboratory in Rome, N.Y., and merged it with a lab elsewhere.

Their October cost-benefit analysis found that moving the lab would be so expensive -- $133.8 million -- that it would far outweigh the $1.5 million in annual savings from closing it. Indeed, the computer determined it would take more than 100 years to recoup the price of the move. So the Air Force ranked the Rome laboratory among the last installations it would consider closing.

But four months later, as politicians across the country lobbied feverishly to save their local bases, the Air Force issued a whole new cost-benefit analysis. It said the relocation would cost less than half as much -- $52.8 million -- with big annual savings of $11.5 million.

Suddenly the cost of closing Rome Lab could be recouped in just four years. Suddenly the Air Force had the numbers to justify shutting Rome. On Feb. 28, a week after the second computer run, the Pentagon made public the list of 119 installations it hoped to close or consolidate this year, including, for the first time, Rome Lab, which develops sophisticated electronic equipment for commanders to use to communicate with their forces.
