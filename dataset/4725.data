Microelectronic circuits embedded on pieces of silicon are the building blocks of modern electrical devices, from computers and communication equipment to consumer electronics goods. They are also critical components of weaponry, automobile-engine control systems to improve fuel efficiency and factory automation systems.

The performance of these vital components will continue to improve over the next decade, rippling through the economy. The number of transistors that can be put on a chip will increase from about one million to close to 100 million. As that happens, more and more of the value of a computer will be contained in the chip. Complex chips, specialized for particular tasks, hold out the best hope of achieving long-sought goals like computers that can understand speech or interpret scenes.

The United States still leads in designs of clever circuitry but lags in the ability to manufacture chips. Sematech, the consortium financed by the Government and the semiconductor industry, is seeking to redress that balance. It is also trying to keep alive the endangered American manufacturers of chip-making equipment.

But Sematech alone, even if it is successful, will not be enough, experts say. A big problem for the United States is not technology but capital. Most American companies can no longer afford to build advanced manufacturing plants, which cost several hundred million dollars now and promise to keep getting more expensive.
