The president of the carpenters' union, Douglas J. McCarron, President Bush's closest friend in organized labor, has agreed to return more than $200,000 in profits he made in a stock deal that is under federal investigation.

On Tuesday, Mr. McCarron informed the Union Labor Life Insurance Company, a labor-owned carrier known as Ullico, that he would pay back the money, which he earned when he sold Ullico shares in what is being investigated for the possibility of insider trading.

The Labor Department and a federal grand jury in Washington are investigating whether the deal, in which Ullico repurchased shares from Mr. McCarron and several other union presidents on its board, enabled them to enrich themselves improperly at the expense of the unions that own the insurer. Those unions include Mr. McCarron's, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.

Subsequent Ullico proxy statements indicated that the board members profited by more than $6 million all told, with Mr. McCarron earning $276,000. In his letter this week to Ullico's chairman, Robert A. Georgine, he said he would return his profits, minus taxes owed. His decision was first reported on Wednesday by the Bureau of National Affairs, a publisher of legal and regulatory news.
