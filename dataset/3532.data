Despite a veto threat from President Clinton, the House of Representatives today passed a bill that would grant a measure of legal protection to the human fetus by establishing new criminal penalties for anyone who injures or harms the fetus while committing another Federal offense.

Supporters of the bill, mainly Republicans, said it would protect ''unborn children'' against assaults and other acts of violence. Opponents said it would undermine abortion rights by granting legal status to the fetus at all stages of development.

The bill was approved, 254 to 172, with support from 198 Republicans and 56 Democrats. The measure was opposed by 150 Democrats, 21 Republicans and 1 independent.

Under the bill passed tonight, a person who injures or kills a fetus in the course of committing any of 68 enumerated Federal crimes could be convicted of a separate offense against the fetus.
