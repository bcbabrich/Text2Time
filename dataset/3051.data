''Not at all,'' he said. ''If anything, the last three made it harder. We go into Baltimore, we really played well. Who gets 540 yards in the pro game? If not for a few errant plays, we'd be playing this weekend and I'd still be coaching the Jets. A couple of people, when I told them about the offer, said, 'You need to consider this; it's a great fit for you.' When that is combined with the annual offer of the duration they've made, seven years guaranteed, those numbers started to add up.''

Groh had a four-year contract with the Jets.

Now the Jets must begin the process of hiring a head coach, their fourth in a span of one year. It was almost exactly one year ago, on Jan. 3, 2000, when Parcells stepped down to go to the front office and set off a series of events that, even by the bizarre standards of Jets' coaching history, were mind-bending.

Parcells is expected to meet with the team owner Woody Johnson tomorrow. Johnson will undoubtedly try to persuade Parcells to become the head coach. Parcells, the director of football operations, may be in line to acquire even more power as the president of the team, but Johnson knows that the players are clamoring for stability and would love to see Parcells back on the sideline.

Minutes after he learned about Groh's departure, cornerback Ray Mickens said he and players that he had spoken to were concerned about the uncertainty the team faces. Groh said he has not talked to players since he left. ''Having been around these situations before, when you leave, nobody wants to hear from you,'' he said.

But for players, even seemingly mundane matters hang in the balance when a coach departs. What will the off-season workout program be like? When will the players be expected to report for minicamps? Will their assistant coaches, with whom players have intense contact, be the next to go? Groh said he would take only his son Mike, a former Virginia player, with him from the Jets staff. Mickens said Parcells was the best coach he had ever played for and he would love to have him back.

But Parcells has insisted that he is done with coaching, even though there are constant murmurs from others to the contrary. Parcells could feel a sense of obligation to help the Jets. His two hand-picked successors -- Bill Belichick and Groh -- have blown up spectacularly in the Jets' faces. Parcells could agree to come back simply to steady the ship for one year.

One person who does not seem concerned is the offensive line coach Bill Muir. With the exception of the receivers coach Todd Haley, the rest of the assistants have another year remaining on their contracts, according to Muir. Unless the Jets go outside the organization for a coach who wants to clean house, much of the franchise will look the same.
