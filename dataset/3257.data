The proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner drew skeptical questioning today from the Senate Judiciary Committee, as lawmakers challenged a new pledge by the companies to open Time Warner's cable television system to other Internet service providers once the deal is completed.

The pledge, announced just hours before the panel's hearing, was not binding, but it provided a framework for how the two companies would ensure that consumers have access over Time Warner Cable to service providers other than AOL.

Central to the framework is a provision that allows consumers to choose Internet providers not affiliated with America Online Time Warner and still get high-speed, or broadband, services over cable modems.

Industry analysts said the memorandum tried to ease the concerns of regulators, online rivals and other open-access advocates that the proposed $165 billion merger could limit competition in the hotly contested Internet field.
