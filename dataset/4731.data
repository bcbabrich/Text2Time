"There's plenty of cash on the sidelines," he added, "and it will be supporting the market on any pullback."

Commenting on program trading, where market professionals make a profit on small price differentials between, say, futures contracts on the S.&P. 500 index and on the stocks themselves, Mr. Birinyi maintained that the practice had "a markedly negative impact and accelerated some of the downtrends considerably more than it helped on the up side."

The market in 1990, he said, was up 52 percent of the time. "The obvious reason we ended with a down year," he added, "was that the bad days had greater declines than the good days" had gains. He said that program trading averaged about 20 percent of the volume during 1990 -- "well over an hour a day on average." Downtrend Was Accelerated

"During this period," he added, "the market fell more than 800 points. But that's not to suggest that program trading was the primary cause. But in many cases program trading accelerated the downtrend without causing it. There's a very definite strong relationship, but there are too many facets to the stock market to blame or credit just one."

Figures supplied by S.&P. on the best and worst performing stock groups through Thursday, show that health-care stocks rose 58.3 percent, soft drinks 22.1 percent and tobacco 20.8 percent. Diversified health-care stocks rose 17.2 percent, household products 15 percent, medical products 14.7 percent, cosmetics 13.1 percent and drugs 11.2 percent.

Hotel stocks fell 62.7 percent, leisure stocks 45.8 percent, machine tools 42.1 percent and long-distance telecommunications 38.1 percent. Worst Since 1981

Both the Dow and the S.&P. 500 turned in their worst performance since 1981, when the blue-chip average slid 9.2 percent, and the 500 lost 9.7 percent. The S.&P. has advanced every year since then, but the Dow fell 3.8 percent in 1984, the last time it was in negative territory for a year.
