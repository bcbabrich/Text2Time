However, the Western move ran into resistance from Africans who objected mainly because it called for only a sixmonth ban, subject to renewal, rather than an open‐ended embargo and that it also made no mention of revoking licenses that could enable South Africa, to produce armaments as sophisticated as fighter planes.

After the Africans brushed aside the Western arms embargo proposal, forcing a vote and bringing on the subsequent vetoes, West Germany and Canada tonight revived and formally introduced a modified resolution in the name of the five Western members that met at least some of the African demands, such as dropping the six‐month time limit. It was uncertain whether the Africans would agree or try instead to press for further changes. Andrew Young, the United States delegate, appealed for speedy action, saying, “I don't think that anybody is as happy about this delay as John Vorster is,” alluding to the South African Prime Minister.

The present text would oblige members and call on nonmember nations to cease providing arms, ammunition, military vehicles and equipment and spare parts. Mr. Young, the United States delegate, speaking in support of the Western members' initiative that was begun last Thursday, sought to underscore the wilingness of thsi group to impose for the first time any form of sanctions against a United Nations member.

In a speech in which he disavowed any wish to isolate South Africa, he emphasized that the intention was to induce the Pretoria Government to end its racially discriminatory policies.

Mr. Young emphasized that the Carter Administration was reviewing its relations with South Africa “in all areas,” including nuclear cooperation.

Referring to denials by Prime Minister John Vorster of recent reports that the South African Government was planning a nuclear test, Mr. Young said: “We take these assurances seriously and would respond promptly and vigorously in concert with others should it appear that South Africa does not intend to honor them.”

Initially some African members in the Council had complained that the Western proposal for ban on arms sales was inadequate because it did not prohibit nuclear cooperation. This was an element in one of the vetoed resolutions, and Mr. Young's intention clearly was to allay the expressed concern of the Africans on this point.
