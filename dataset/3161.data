For the third time, the White House has delayed the release of thousands of documents from the Reagan presidency, including papers from senior advisers who serve in the current administration, officials said today.

The White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, notified the national archivist today that the White House would require ''a few more weeks'' to determine the best means for making the records public.

The papers were scheduled to be released in January, but Mr. Gonzales twice informed the archivist, John Carlin, of the need for extensions. In obtaining another delay, Mr. Gonzales said he was concerned about establishing a proper precedent for complying with the Presidential Records Act of 1978.

The law provides that documents dealing with White House aides' advice to a president must be released 12 years after the end of the administration. Ronald Reagan's papers are the first to fall under its purview.
