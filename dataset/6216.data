The American Stock Exchange and the over‐the‐counter market closed lower yesterday in somewhat heavier trading.

Brokers attributed some of the weakness to investors' uncertainty over the economic outlook because of the report late last week of a second straight decline in the monthly leading economic indicators.

The Amex market value index fell 0.47 to 85.35 as the price of an average share fell 5 cents. Turnover rose to 1.7 million shares from 1.27 million shares on Friday. Nine blocks of 10,000 shares or more changed hands compared with seven on Friday.

In the counter market, the NASDAQ industrial index declined 0.19 to 82.47 while the composite index eased 0.14 and 78.66. There were 455 issues declining while 331 rose. Volume expanded to 4.91 million shares from 3.49 million on Friday.
