TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — I can predict some of the reaction to today’s puzzle. “I didn’t see the theme until I was finished solving.” This will be uttered with a dismissive wave, as if that’s the measure of the puzzle. On the other side will be admirers. Where you end up probably depends on your skill and experience.

First of all, if you regularly solve Monday and Tuesday puzzles in under 4 or 5 minutes, then you’re not the primary target audience for Monday and Tuesday puzzles. You’re probably using them as a warm-up to a coming competition and your goal is to break your own personal records. Nothing wrong with that. Many people get tons of enjoyment out of just that. But think back to when early-week themes were not just amusing or clever on their own — they were solving aids, a third clue dimension to help you suss out tough corners. Remember when EGAD was unfamiliar, when STOAS were unknown, when EDDAS were obviously typos. It’s puzzles like today’s that bring a new generation of solvers into the fold. Many of them are going to get hooked. One or two might just jump past you at the A.C.P.T. in a few years! You never know.

Thank goodness for William Shakespeare and the Bible. Between them, there are an infinite number of words including every possible letter combination. When you absolutely need a no-no like ON ON, rely on the Bard. Who can complain? It’s culture, right? Initials help too, of course. The St. Louis Blues is the perfect team to represent the N.H.L. in a puzzle. Not only does the phrase stand on its own, but who but a fan would ever guess there would be a hockey team in Missouri? In case you live in a “blue” state, I’ll also explain that N.H.R.A. is the National Hot Rod Association.

“A Grimm beginning” is nice. The “First unelected president” was #10, John TYLER. William Henry Harrison (#9) died and without Alexander Haig around to help out, it took a whole month to sort out the succession.

“Miracle ___” appears for the second day in a row. What is Will trying to tell us? I have the answer. Miracle GRO is an anagram of MORE GARLIC, which is essential for warding off vampires. It’s a health tip.
