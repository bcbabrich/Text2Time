They are calling it "The Return of Holy Bull." It is the main event in New York racing for the Fourth of July weekend and it will unfold on Sunday in the Dwyer Stakes, with only three or four other horses daring to match strides with the 3-year-old speed demon.

But a strong supporting cast for the weekend took shape yesterday when nine accomplished turf horses were entered in the Bowling Green Handicap at Belmont Park tomorrow. They were led by Sea Hero, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Travers last year; Solar Splendor, one of the war horses of grass racing, and Fraise, who has won $2.5 million racing on grass. They will run a mile and a half for a purse of $150,000.

Sea Hero, the colt who went a mile and a quarter on the dirt to win the Derby and the Travers, is switching back to the turf for an even longer race, one mile and three-eighths, only two weeks after he ran third on the dirt behind Devil His Due and Wallenda in the Brooklyn Handicap. His trainer, MacKenzie Miller, asks: Why not?

"I was testing him in that race to see how he would do," Miller said yesterday at his Belmont barn. "And he did run well. He hasn't run this far on the turf, but he's won classic races on the dirt and he's run up to a mile and a half on the dirt."
