The German troop transport that collided head on with an Air Force cargo jet off the coast of Africa last September, killing 33, was cruising at the wrong altitude, the Pentagon said today.

The German plane, a Soviet-made Tupolev 154, was flying at 35,000 feet, but should have been flying at least 2,000 feet lower or 2,000 feet higher as it headed southeasterly over the Atlantic toward Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, for a refueling stop, said Col. William H. C. Schell Jr., who headed the Air Force investigation of the crash.

At impact, the Air Force jet, a C-141, was flying northwesterly from Windhoek, on the first leg of its journey back to its home base here, after delivering Army equipment and troops to Namibia to aid the search for land mines buried during its war of independence from South Africa. The two planes hit almost nose to nose.

The C-141's nine crew members were killed. Last December, divers recovered the remains of two crew members, Capt. Peter C. Vallejo and Capt. Jason S. Ramsey. Other skeletal remains were found on the ocean bottom, but could not be identified, the report said.
