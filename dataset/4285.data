The Jets are playing a waiting game with the contract offers they have extended to quarterback Steve DeBerg, an unrestricted free agent from Miami, and kick returner Brian Mitchell, an unrestricted free agent from the Redskins. The Jets would not divulge the terms of the offers they have made to DeBerg and Mitchell.

DeBerg, who started last season with Tampa Bay and finished with Miami, is also negotiating with the Dolphins. Jets General Manager Dick Steinberg said that the DeBerg deal, if it is done, will not be a "heavy deal" that will adversely affect the team's salary-cap situation.

"I would say that both teams are close to what he's looking for in terms of a team," said Jack Childers, DeBerg's agent, referring to the Jets and the Dolphins. "He feels that both teams have an equal possibility of making the playoffs. And as far as winning games, both teams are the same. He has high regard for both Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason." An Offer to Nagle

If the Jets sign DeBerg, Browning Nagle, the backup to Esiason last year, will have little leverage to negotiate a new deal. The Jets have already made Nagle, a restricted free agent, a qualifying offer of $825,000 in order to retain his rights. If they sign him it will be for considerably less money. Or they might even cut him. The Jets have been looking to trade Nagle, but they have not received any offers.
