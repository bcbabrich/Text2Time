Introduced on: There was no official New York coming-out party.

Is it real? Sure is. Assembly lines in Trollhättan, Sweden, are once again cranking out cars after a dramatic ninth-inning save by Spyker Cars. Sculpted under the authority of General Motors, the Saab 9-5 emerged surprisingly Scandinavian with its stalwart, sinuous physique at the Frankfurt auto show in September.

What they said: Saab says the second-generation 9-5 was mostly developed in the company’s Trollhättan headquarters, where it will also be built. While it may take some time for the dust to settle from the bruised automaker’s shakeup, the 9-5 offers a kernel of substance for the company’s new owners.

What they didn’t say: Whether or not Spyker will ultimately be rewarded with a happy ending for its plucky resolve to keep Saab afloat. To compete, the Saab 9-5 must woo buyers in a heavy-hitter league that includes the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the BMW 5 Series and the Audi A6. Success rides on how much Spyker is willing to invest in the long-term game to regain consumer trust and dedication to the discerning high-end Swedish aesthetic.

What makes it tick? Feisty turbo power, nimble all-wheel drive and smartly placed aeronautic references like the Pilot Head-Up display. The initial 2.8-liter V-6 engine offering spouts 300 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The turbocharged BioPower 4-cylinder E85 engine will follow. All transmissions will be 6-speeds.

How soon? How much? The 9-5 is due in dealerships this summer with estimated prices upward of $40,000.

How does it look? Like a Saab, which is a compliment for a company that has traditionally been on the fringes with athletic, functional forms. The 9-5 is the thinking person’s sports sedan with sweeping spatial proportions extracted from the concept Aero X.
