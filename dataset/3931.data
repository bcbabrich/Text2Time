The death in New York City of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, allegedly at the hands of her mother, has focused national attention on an issue that, too often, is pushed to the sidelines. Congress, in particular, should be mindful of Elisa's fate as it moves to weaken programs that are designed to protect the nation's most vulnerable children -- victims of abuse and neglect.

Child abuse is hardly a new phenomenon. It burst onto the national consciousness in the late 1960's and early 1970's when a number of books and studies about battered children appeared. These were not tales of occasional maltreatment, but prolonged patterns of physical and sexual abuse. Studies also made it clear that child abuse and other forms of family violence were linked to alcohol, drug abuse and economic devastation.

Doctors, teachers and neighbors have been enlisted in the effort to look for and report abuse cases. But it falls mainly to the child welfare system, a patchwork of programs usually run by states and counties, to protect abused and neglected children and offer services to troubled families where children are at risk. The system also helps families who take responsibility for neglected and abandoned children through foster care or adoption.

In 1994, there were 3.1 million reports of child abuse and neglect, of which 1 million were substantiated. That year, 1,300 child abuse victims died.
