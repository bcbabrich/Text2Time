Just six weeks after making its initial public stock offering, the Computervision Corporation watched Wall Street hammer that stock yesterday, after the company announced that results for its third fiscal quarter would be "substantially below" expectations.

Computervision's shares lost more than 30 percent of their value yesterday, falling $3 each to close at $6.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

The company, formerly known as Prime Computer Inc., had already been predicting an unspecified loss for the quarter. It gave no details yesterday as to how much worse the final numbers might be.

"The decline was more than we expected," Harvey Wagner, Computervision's chief executive officer, said, adding that the company could not be more specific until it finished sifting through its data.
