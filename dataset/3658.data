Innovative jazz and mainstream popular music grew further and further apart in the 1940's and 50's. Jazz singers still had their pop hits, but you certainly couldn't say that singers like Anita O'Day, Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan or Mel Torme were at the center of the culture's consciousness; they were on its vigorous borders or in its vanguard. Of the mainstream performers who made their names in the war and postwar years, Sinatra, Ms. Lee and Cole (despite the trash he sometimes had to record) were the hit makers who kept the jazz-pop links center stage. (Doris Day was a very good singer, but she concentrated on movies, not recordings.)

Sinatra's other great gift, of course, was his sexual charisma. Whatever he sang, it was there. The jaunty manliness was sexy; so was the melancholy introspection; so was the edgy rebelliousness one saw most clearly in his best film performances. He was a star, and he had what real stars have: the ability to take their gifts, their limitations and their influences and mold them into a unified whole called My Personality. The force of that personality is what makes Sinatra unforgettable.

But why claim, as some do, that Sinatra was the first popular singer to think of himself as an artist? Surely we don't still believe, given the evidence of the work they put in (the practicing, the jam sessions, the attention paid to opera singers, actors, horn players and their own own peers), that the masters of the preceding generation didn't know they were artists. Holiday, Armstrong and Mabel Mercer -- the English song-actress nonpareil whom Sinatra called a major influence along with Holiday and Tommy Dorsey -- all wore an armor of modesty in public, but that shouldn't fool us anymore. They knew their worth.

It has been very unpleasant reading these eulogies to see how segregated, racially and sexually, views of popular music remain. And wearying to have to note that nearly all of the pre-Sinatra innovators who are left out of this musical hagiography are blacks and women. In my generation this is called the Elvis Presley syndrome. The setting: A fertile but largely unformed musical world. The action: He arrives.

It makes one remember that preferential treatment based on race and gender has always been the norm in American life; it is only the beneficiaries who have changed in the last few decades. For all of his talent and drive, Sinatra benefited greatly from the preferential treatment given his race and gender, as if by natural right in those days. (So, for all of his greatness as a dancer, did Fred Astaire.) Not only did Sinatra have unparalleled power in the music industry, he got to act out a lavish drama of masculinity that thrilled the entire culture.

What black man could have gotten away with such cocky brashness and become a star of that magnitude? (Witness the unusually passive public demeanor of Cole.) What woman of either race could have? They simply could not have seized the imagination and approval of a mass audience with such open displays of power and nose-thumbing.

Sinatra was a great performer because he joined kinetic musical force to what looked and sounded like pure naturalism. It was also his great good fortune to come of age in a time when the world still considered whiteness and maleness the best and most natural of states.
