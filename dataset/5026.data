Georgia Tech from 1904 to 1966 featured a coaching clan of John Heisman (yes, the Heisman for whom the trophy is named), William Alexander and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Yellow Jackets' stadium is named. Each of those coaches won at least 102 games. From 1939 through 1966, Georgia Tech nearly always finished ranked among the nation's top 15 teams. It is one of only four teams along with Alabama, Georgia and Notre Dame to win each of the major bowls (the '29 Rose, the '55 Cotton, the '40, '48, and '52 Orange and '44, '53, '54 and '56 Sugar).

Attempting to recapture that stature, Ross hired a veteran staff of assistants and mixed them with promising young coaches. He credits his staff for taking the lead and beyond in the recruiting wars, leaving few stones unturned.

One of his most remarkable accomplishments was not only garnering talented players but speedy ones, too. Virginia's offense ranks first nationally, averaging 544.9 yards and 48.1 points a game. But the Yellow Jackets on both sides of the football possess the speed to keep track.

"Speed is a difficult thing to identify, but our coaches had a feel," Ross said. "I put emphasis on it. I told them I didn't care how big the recruits were, they just better be able to run." Special Satisfaction

Georgia Tech's recruiting class of 1988 mirrors Ross's philosophy. The quarterback Shawn Jones, the safety Ken Swilling and the receiver Bobby Rodriguez were part of a prize group signed that year.

Rodriguez, from from Wagner High School in New York City, mirrors the thinking of Ross's recruits.

"When you go to a team that has struggled and you see the accomplishment, it means so much more," said Rodriguez, who opted for Georgia Tech over Syracuse and Michigan State. "All the guys that I came in with are excited that much of the change here coincided with when we came.

"With Coach Ross, we have a very honest and caring coach, and those are his two attributes that stand out most. He is a very intelligent coach. He runs a pro-style offense and that suited me perfectly. And, with Atlanta being a major city, guys from big cities like New York and Los Angeles love it here. It socially gives you a slower pace, but not too slow." New Hero Emerges
