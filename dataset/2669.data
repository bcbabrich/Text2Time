The 19th International Festival of Ballet of Havana, which brings together artists from 23 countries, opened Thursday night to sold-out audiences at the grimy, cherub-studded Gran Teatro de la Habana in the heart of the old city. The festival, which runs through Nov. 6, is laden with performances of "Carmen," "Swan Lake" and other war horses of the classical repertory. There are also tributes to George Balanchine and Antonio Gades, and eight world premieres, including three choreographed by Alicia Alonso, the blind director of the Ballet Nacional de Cuba.
