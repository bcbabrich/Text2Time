The search is one of the largest joint law-enforcement operations undertaken by the two countries. Its intensity and scope suggested that officials believe that they have firm leads to help them begin to resolve the mystery surrounding the scores of people who have disappeared in the last several years.

But so far, authorities said, they have not found a body.

The joint operation was confirmed today by the Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, and the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh.

Jose Larrieta Carrasco, director of Mexico's organized crime unit, said at a news conference in El Paso that some remains had been found that may be human. They are being analyzed, he said, and he expressed confidence that the search could bear results.

''We have very concrete information as to these sites,'' he added.

David Alba, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s office in El Paso, who appeared with Mr. Larrieta, said 65 agents were taking part in the search at the four sites. The bureau has set up a command post in El Paso where it will bring any remains for analysis.

Mexican officials have developed extensive files on at least 100 people who have disappeared in and around Juarez. The Association of Relatives and Friends of Disappeared Persons, based in El Paso, has compiled a list of 196 people who have disappeared, most from Juarez, and the Juarez newspaper Norte has a list of 120. The missing include 22 Americans, officials from both nations said.
