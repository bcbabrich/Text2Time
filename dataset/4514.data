Chandler Brossard, a writer, an editor and an educator, died on Sunday at Calvary Hospice in the Bronx. He was 71 and lived in Manhattan.

The cause was cancer, his family said.

Mr. Brossard, who was self-educated, wrote or edited 17 books of fiction and nonfiction. He was the author of four plays, all of which were produced in St. Louis in the early 1960's.

Over the years, he taught or was writer in residence at the State University College at Old Westbury, L.I., the University of Birmingham in England, the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, Schiller College in Paris, the University of California at Riverside, and the University of San Diego.

He was born in Idaho Falls and was brought up in Washington. At 11, he decided that school offered him little. He quit and immersed himself in the literary classics with his older brother Vincent as his guide. Newspapers and Magazines
