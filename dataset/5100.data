Galavision, a Spanish-language cable network, is eroding the lead of the two largest Spanish-language broadcasting networks in the United States.

Galavision and cable operators that carry it assert that they have begun to gain a substantial slice of the national Hispanic advertising budget of more than $400 million, most of which has historically gone to the Univision and Telemundo networks.

Galavision, based in Los Angeles, is closely connected with the Mexican communications conglomerate Televisa. After two years on cable, the 24-hour network is now seen in two million Hispanic households through 300 cable systems in 12 states and the District of Columbia.

Galavision's 18 hours of news and entertainment and 6 hours of variety shows are supplied at low cost by Televisa. The programming appears to be aimed primarily at Mexican-Americans. According to the Census Bureau, people of Mexican origin accounted for 64 percent of the country's Hispanic population of 18.8 million in 1987.
