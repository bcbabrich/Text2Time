New Jersey's share of the Harbor Festival will be held at Port Newark, the big container port of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and at Liberty State Park, which looks out at the Statue of Liberty from the Jersey City shoreline.

Today and tomorrow from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., Port Newark's Shed 291 will be transformed from an 800-foot cargo warehouse into a long walkway of dozens of flags and booths featuring a wide variety of foods, arts and crafts. Docked just outside and open for touring will be the Portuguese destroyer Almirante Magalhaes Correa from the NATO fleet, visiting the harbor; the folk singer Pete Seeger's sloop, the Clearwater, and the month-old driftwood collector Gelberman of the Army Corps of Engineers. Inside the hall will be wandering minstrels, a storytelling corner for children and demonstrations of ceramics and weaving. Admission is free. To reach Port Newark, take Exit 14 from the New Jersey Turnpike and follow signs to Shed 291.

A cannon salute at noon tomorrow at Liberty State Park will open a day of music and the performings arts, featuring a concert by the New Jersey Pops, a bluegrass program, a three-hour Scandinavian festival, with a 40-piece band from Sweden, folk-dance troupes and a choir, and a performance by the New Jersey Band. The park is a good vantage point for Macy's fireworks display, which begins at 9:15 P.M. There is no admission to the park. Take Exit 14B from the New Jersey Turnpike and follow the signs.

Since 1975, a restored 18th-century Colonial village called East Jersey Old Town has been growing in Johnson Park on the banks of the Raritan River in Piscataway. On the Fourth, a reproduction of a Revolutionary-era blacksmith shop will be officially dedicated as the little village's 17th building. Others already in the 12-acre plot include a church, tavern, troop barracks, jail, slave sanctuary, Dutch Colonial home, farmhouse and a headquarters used by Gen. Henry Knox, Washington's artillery officer in the Revolution. Thirty blacksmiths will demonstrate their craft during the dedication from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. Farm animals will be displayed for children and old-fashioned rug braiding and glassblowing will also be shown. Everything's free. From Exit 9 on the New Jersey Turnpike, take Route 18 into New Brunswick, cross the Raritan, and look for Johnson Park near Hoes Lane.
