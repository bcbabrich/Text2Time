HELSEL--Randi. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation and its Co-Founders, Vicki and Fred Modell, mourn the passing of our precious sister Randi. She shared a committed love for her husband Harvey, for nearly 60 years. She took great pride in her children and grandchildren. Randi was high spirited, energetic, and taught all of us how to savor every moment of every day. She brightened our lives with unbridled joy, enthusiasm and a sense of humor encouraging each of us to reach up and do the best we could. Randi left an indelible imprint on this world gracing us with dignity and class, embracing us with compassion and understanding. Our lives will forever be enriched because of you, Randi. How we will miss you. Rest in Peace. With all our love, Vicki and Fred
