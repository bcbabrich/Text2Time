The new attention to turnout also reflects the emerging influence of the Internet, which, through e-mail directed at registered Democrats and Republicans, could supplant the door knock and the evening telephone call as the easiest and most effective way of reaching sure-fire supporters.

This changing environment is one force that has made the presidential campaign of Howard Dean, who has assembled an extraordinarily motivated base of supporters, so unpredictable, and it is why some Democrats are not as quick as Republicans to discount Dr. Dean's chances of defeating Mr. Bush, should he become his party's nominee.

Voter turnout campaigns are typically more influential in primaries, because fewer people vote, making the outcome easier to affect. At the very least, several Democrats said, Dr. Dean's ability to use new techniques to identify and turn out a base of supporters makes him a formidable figure in early primary states.

But Dr. Dean, in remarks at a pig roast here in central New Hampshire this afternoon, noted that a shift of just a few percentage points in states like New Hampshire would have delivered the White House to Al Gore in 2000. And he urged supporters who showed up at his events to register their e-mail addresses with his campaign, so they can be contacted as Election Day approaches. Dr. Dean's aides are creating a database that merges e-mail addresses with voter registration rolls and the history of voting behavior.

This is the latest chapter of a shift that became particularly vivid after the 2000 presidential election, which White House officials believe Mr. Bush nearly lost because the Democrats mounted the kind of highly effective voter turnout effort that had long been identified with the party. Thus, in the 2002 midterm elections, Republicans put in place a plan known as the 72-Hour Task Force to identify Republican voters and get them to the polls. The Republicans beat the Democrats at their own game, winning control of the Senate while widening their margin in the House.

David B. Magleby, the dean of social sciences at Brigham Young University, who conducted a study of spending in the 2002 Congressional election, reported evidence of a sharp change in emphasis away from television advertisements and toward get-out-the-vote efforts. He is planning a study of the 2004 race and said he expected each party to significantly increase the resources devoted to getting out the vote.

Republicans are almost certain to enjoy an advantage in their operations because of a huge fund-raising advantage. Officials from each party declined to say how much they were planning to spend on setting up turnout operations, but the parties have already begun registering voters, setting up computer programs and training party officials in ways to identify and turn out supporters.
