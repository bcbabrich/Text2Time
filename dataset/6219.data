Most of the programs that the commission recommended had been proposed before, at least in basic form. Thus the creation of a merged “Superior Court” was suggested by another state group in the midnineteen‐sixties. And the idea of a centralized court administration to replace the present Administrative Board has been suggested numerous times.

The suggestion that the state pay all costs of the courts has been made by Mayor Lindsay and by Chief Judge Stanley H. Fuld and others.

Though no state has yet done away with the bail system, different aspects of reform have been broached by various groups here. According to the commission, a judge should either release a defendant on his own recognizance or release him subject to certain conditions and supervision—the supervision to be provided by an expanded Probation Department. And if a defendant has previously failed to meet court date, or where the charge is a felony, the judge should be allowed to detain the defendant if it thinks that detention is needed to ensure the defendant's appearance for trial. He would have to give his reasons, in writing, for thinking this.

The commission's plan for judicial discipline—the creation of a full‐time staffed commission to investigate complaints about judges—has also been suggested before and, in fact, is modeled after the California system.

But the commission proposal adds some refinements that. according to Mr. Jerry would make New York's system the “strictest in the land.” The commission could censure judges. If it wanted a judge retired or removed it would refer the case to the Court on the Judiciary which, under the commission plan, would be made a permanent court. The court now is convened by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals only after documented complaints have been lodged.

Nearly all of the commission's proposals require constitutional amendments and some also require subsequent legislation.

In an effort to help get its proposals passed —in a year when many others, including the Governor and Mayor Lindsay, are also planning courtreform packages to the Legislature—the commission included in its report a full volume of proposed constitutional and statutory amendments.
