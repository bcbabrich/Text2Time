Gerald J. Ford, chairman of the Ford Bank Group, has been known to study a newly acquired bank's existing management for up to six months before making any changes.

Mr. Ford, as head of the Ford Bank Group, oversees 14 subsidiary banks throughout New Mexico, and 11 banks in Texas. Many of the banks were on the verge of insolvency at the time of acquisition. His latest complex deal calls for the Ford Bank Group to take over BankTexas Group Inc. in Dallas.

But when, or if, Mr. Ford takes over the long-beleaguered BancTexas Dallas, the lead bank of BankTexas Group, unlike his other deals, he does not plan to wait long before making changes.

Moving in slowly and observing the present organization, he said, is not what the situation dictates.
