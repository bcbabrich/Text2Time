To the Editor:

Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, correctly recognized President Clinton's proposal to ''save Social Security'' by investing a portion of it in the stock market as politicizing the monetary policy apparatus that took a century to de-politicize. Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, Jan. 26) seems to imply that it would be better to have Congress establish interest rates by a process of open public debate than to let such decisions be made behind closed doors by the Fed. Can anyone think of a better way to legislate economic catastrophe than to have Congress set interest rates?

We have now learned that the threat of deposing the President has less effect on the financial markets than the subtle implications of Mr. Greenspan's comments on interest rates. We seem finally to have a monetary system that works. It would be better not to fix it.
