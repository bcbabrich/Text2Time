I AM quite possibly a fusspot about my mirages, and so my own mirage list has always been exceedingly short. I'd had two favorites. Now, since this last trip, I have a triumvirate. And since, as always with travel, the perception of a place seems to depend as much upon the baggage we bring to the scene as upon the scene itself, here are my three and my baggage:

VENICE I never used to believe anything anybody told me or showed me about Venice. I had been seeing those picture books, postcards, paintings all my life, as have we all. The requisite view of the Doges' Palace across the curve of the Grand Canal, a dream floating on shimmering waters. The powerful A-frame forms of gondoliers silhouetted against shimmering waters. Shimmering waters lapping sweetly (garbage unseen) at the piers (decay unseen) of magnificent private palaces. All that shimmer, and I would think, Ah, come on, you are putting nothing over on me. It is not really a city that lives on water. Maybe a canal here and there, but the postcard is just a chamber of commerce trick, a cunningly chosen locale, designed to convince us prospective tourists that the whole town really looks like this.

But it did. So much so that I could not grasp it, couldn't accept that the glorious illusion was real, even as I followed those side streets (streams?) looking for where the fantasy might end and earthbound reality take over, as in ''The Truman Show.'' But no. Water everywhere, just as I had fervently hoped but not for a moment believed. That's a mirage.

THE GRAND CANYON It was in the late 60's when my late husband, Hal, the swell surprise artist, who had been there often, arranged this particular surprise: Drove me there on the night of a full moon, parked the car, blindfolded me, led me some distance, then stopped and removed the blindfold. No one else around. Moon like a klieg light. And in the brilliance of that night, and in the profoundest silence I'd ever heard, I took one disbelieving look and shrieked -- simply yowled out my astonishment, and the howl went echoing across those bottomless convolutions that could not possibly exist outside of dreams.

PETRA Home of the Biblical Nabateans, who in 600 B.C. came north from what is now Yemen into what is now Jordan, south of the Dead Sea, and there, amid wildly sculptured sandstone peaks, built a fortress city from which they controlled the trade route between the Egyptian and Greek and Roman cultures for 700 years.

That's the history. But how to describe the mirage?

Much of what makes the sight so remarkable is the tension between sight and setting, as is often the case with mirages. You approach (on foot, the only means allowed, except to disabled visitors) through a great rock gorge that looks as brutal as rock gets. It is a half-mile long, never wider than a two-car garage, mostly much less, and dim, because the rock walls, rising 100 feet on either side, close inward as they rise, leaving at the top a mere sliver of sky and leaving you a bit claustrophobic.

Suddenly you see light at the end of this tunnel. And then, dead ahead, in this primordial nowhere, in a clearing framed by these jagged rock walls, appears the sublime facade of a Greco-Roman-Egyptian-style edifice, five stories tall and celestially pink, carved out of the side of a pink-sandstone mountain. Corinthian columns, broken pediments, griffins and urns, the works.

This vision is called The Treasury. Scores of temples, tombs and theaters lead ever upward, an arduous hour's hike in the heat, to a final vision called The Monastery, near the top. As I stood there, trying to grasp what I had seen, I heard music. A flute. A simple, insistent tune, wafting downward. I looked up and saw him, a speck at the very top, and began climbing. I was panting and drenched in sweat, but this was my vision and my Pied Piper, and how could I not follow?
