THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — I don’t remember the last time I saw a quip theme in a New York Times puzzle, mostly because Will Shortz generally doesn’t run them. Today, however, he makes an exception for Stu Ockman, who is also making his debut. I asked Mr. Shortz why quip themes run so rarely, and he responded:

“Generally speaking, quip themes are not as interesting as more traditional themes because they give the solver only one “Aha!” (usually at the end), whereas a traditional theme provides a little punch with each entry. Therefore, for a quip or quote theme to be worth devoting an entire puzzle to, the “Aha!” needs to be really big, such as by being very funny or very interesting. Most quips and quotes just don’t have that big a punch. Also, it’s really hard to get quips and quotes that appeal to a broad range of solvers. A quip that’s funny to one solver probably won’t be funny to someone else. I think quip and quote themes are worth running once in a while, as with [Mr. Ockman’s] puzzle, for variety’s sake — just not too often.”

Mr. Ockman quotes the philosopher Confucius in his grid, and I personally couldn’t agree more with the quote. We learn many things in life — especially from crossword puzzles, am I right? — but the older we get, it seems, the more we realize how little we actually know. Don’t even get me started on trying to remember where I put my car keys.

I was surprised to see that the nice, long Down 15s — IN ALL LIKELIHOOD and BEETHOVEN’S NINTH — were not first-timers, and I wasn’t partial to the partial A LET at 61 Across. I’m not even sure what a let really is in tennis, and I sure didn’t like it as a partial fill-in-the-blank.

All in all, however, this was a nice debut.

Some parents in China are embracing the return of Confucian philosophy as a means of educating their children:

But you knew I’d have to include this as well, even though Confucius was thoughtlessly left out:

Let’s meet Mr. Ockman:

Constructor’s Notes

If I don’t succeed in embarrassing myself with my first puzzle (be gentle, Rex), I’ll surely succeed with these constructor notes. I’m a civil engineer in real life, and I’ve always found constructing things to be an enjoyable challenge. I started solving crossword puzzles in sixth grade, and New York Times crosswords a year later. So when Adam Perl, a longtime friend and college classmate, mentioned that his crossword would be in The New York Times on Thursday (at the very end of a long phone call), I started to research crossword construction on the Web. Soon, armed with a trial version of Crossword Compiler, I submitted my first puzzle to Will on Christmas Day, 2010. And, the rest is history! In case you’re still reading, that particular puzzle has never appeared in The New York Times. But, I’ve learned a lot from Will’s suggestions, and Adam is the best crossword mentor in upstate New York (it was Adam’s 16th New York Times crossword). Thanks Will, and especially, thanks Adam! I couldn’t have done it without you two. In my first dozen puzzles, I tried three with what I thought were great quotes. “They have miscalculated me as a leader”, a George W. Bush malapropism, sadly (depending on your political point of view), did not make the cut. “I made a killing on Wall Street a few years ago. shot my broker”, by Groucho Marx, was rejected with a note that The New York Times almost never runs quip-themed puzzles. Finally, scouring the Internet for suitable material, I stumbled on the Confucius quote featured in tomorrow’s puzzle. Hope you enjoy it.
