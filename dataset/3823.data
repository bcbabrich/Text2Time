''Her I don't like at all,'' Ms. Furnback, 41, said. ''She tells us she's going to do so much, then she doesn't do anything. I have a friend whose taxes dropped $30 a year after her tax cut, but then his property taxes went up $500. Where's the good in that?''

Ms. Furnback voted for Mrs. Whitman in 1993. So did 43 percent of the voters here, a startling number given the strong Democratic presence in town. Several of the self-described party faithful here said they had rebelled four years ago and voted for Mrs. Whitman. They were annoyed at Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, they said, and excited by the prospect of a female governor. But the novelty has worn off, they said. In particular, many blamed Mrs. Whitman for their high car insurance rates.

''I'm not crazy on politics, but I want to get rid of Christie Todd Whitman,'' said Neil Suydam, 25, a salesman who said he paid $2,500 a year to insure his 1985 Cadillac. ''All of the sudden my car insurance went through the roof this year, and I don't see her doing anything about it.''

Chris Quinn, a school crossing guard who has three children, said she supported Mrs. Whitman in 1993 even though she was a registered Democrat. But while Mrs. Quinn, 48, said she appreciated Mrs. Whitman's tax cuts, she said she resented the Governor's mostly paying for those cuts by reducing state pension contributions by more than $3 billion.

Mrs. Quinn and her husband, also a public employee, oppose the Governor's plan to borrow $2.75 billion to help close a deficit in the state pension system.

''She's not from my level of economics,'' Mrs. Quinn said, standing on the corner in her orange crossing-guard vest. ''She doesn't know what it's like to be in our shoes. She's born of a higher class than we are, and she doesn't know what it's like to struggle.''

While most people interviewed here said they had no idea whether Mr. Andrews and Mr. Murphy empathized with the working class, several believed Mr. McGreevey did. He grew up in Carteret, a hardscrabble city with almost as many oil refineries as Linden. And as the Mayor of Woodbridge, they said, he might understand the plight of cities like Linden, whose tax base has shrunk as factories have closed.
