All this talk of human intervention sounds very different from the hype of the dot-com boom, when startup companies spun visions of computer programs that could help people discover their yet-to-be-revealed tastes in books and music. Imaginative online software was more coveted than gold, and recommendation systems looked like a step toward the creation of artificial intelligence. It was hard not to be intrigued by the idea that with the right data and the right mathematical formula, a computer might be able to grasp a person's preferences better than friends and family, suggesting books or movies that the consumer would not have discovered otherwise.

''There is a sense that with people you are perceived stereotypically, but that the system might give you a totally different chance,'' said Rashmi Sinha, the founder of Uzanto Consulting, a company that focuses on end-user experiences with technology. She is also a cognitive psychologist who has conducted studies of how people respond to recommender systems.

In the mid-1990's, much attention was drawn to collaborative filtering, a technique that matches a user to a group of others who have purchased or praised similar products, then analyzes the group's data to predict what else the user might like. Patti Maes, an expert in the field and a professor at the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called it ''automating word-of-mouth.'' Firefly, a company she helped start, became the symbol of the technology's promise. The New York Times Magazine ran a 4,200-word article in 1997 about Firefly, which was then valued at $100 million, Microsoft bought the company the following year.

It turned out that Microsoft hadn't bought Firefly for its collaborative filter. It wanted the software that kept track of user profiles, which Firefly had called ''passport,'' for what became Microsoft's own Passport software for the quick transfer of personal data. ''They weren't so much interested in the recommendation engine,'' Dr. Maes said in an interview last month. ''It wasn't because they didn't believe in it, but it wasn't as good a match for their strategy.''

Collaborative filtering is only a piece of today's recommendation technology. ''There was this great expectation that it was going to be this killer app, and it didn't meet people's expectations,'' said Jack Aaronson, who helped to design the technology for a recommendation company called Open Sesame and who now runs the Aaronson Group, a consulting practice.

Some of the problems with collaborative filtering are common enough that they have earned nicknames, like the cold start problem and the popularity effect.

To make interesting matches, a company needs a large number of people who have rated or purchased a large number of products. The cold start phenomenon arises when a Web site opens but neither of those criteria has been met. Joe Smith might buy the same book as Jane Doe, but without more data, it would be a stretch to predict that the next book Joe buys is one that Jane might want.
