Then, on Aug. 28, 1952, when the Yankees sent a package to Cincinnati for buggywhip-armed Ewell Blackwell, Yogi Berra and the bullpen catchers formed a cabal, saying they were not going to handle any newcomer this late in the season.

And who will ever forget Sept. 5, 1964, when the Yankees shipped the popular Ralph Terry and Bud Daley to Cleveland for Pedro Ramos? Why, Mickey Mantle did not speak to Ramos as long as he was a Yankee -- even though Ramos's relief pitching got them to the World Series, which they promptly lost because Ramos had arrived too late to be eligible.

If you believe any of these mutiny scenarios, then you are more gullible than I thought. The truth is, the old Yankees were personified by Hank Bauer or Bill Skowron turning to Tony Kubek or Bobby Richardson on opening day and grumbling, ''Hey, Rookie, don't mess with my World Series check.''

The old, old, old Yankees would have accepted Beelzebub himself if he could have smacked a curveball into the corner. Pragmatism should still be in vogue. Nobody likes politics or personalities to interfere with a winning product, but the Yankees have not exactly been cutting a swath through the American League.

Nobody should expect Wade Boggs to like hearing he might sit occasionally against left-handed pitching, but the equation is not Charlie Hayes's career against Wade Boggs's career. The equation is a few extra power swings from a right-handed hitter in September 1996.
