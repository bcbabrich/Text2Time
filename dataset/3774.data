After two years of criticism from Federal environmental officials, Gov. George E. Pataki has announced plans to strengthen New York State's enforcement of environmental laws, particularly those limiting air pollution from large sources like factories and power plants.

The biggest shift would be an increase in inspections for pollution problems and a new emphasis on pursuing the worst violators. Those two factors were identified by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency as particularly weak in New York State last year.

Senior E.P.A. officials said Mr. Pataki's planned changes could end a long decline in environmental enforcement in New York that began late in the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and worsened under Mr. Pataki. Some private environmental groups and political opponents were less optimistic.

A low point was reached last year, according to the E.P.A.'s continuing analysis of the state's programs. The Federal analysis concluded that fines were consistently too low, inspections were far too few, and the pursuit of big companies discharging hundreds of tons of pollutants into the air was ''minimal.''
