The New York Post reported today that Gov. David A. Paterson has asked the state attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, to investigate reports that the State Police had improperly collected information on public officials for political ends. Mr. Cuomo, confirming the report in The Post, issued the following statement this afternoon:

I am in receipt of a letter from Governor Paterson requesting that I conduct an investigation of the State Police. I accept the governor’s direction. I applaud Governor Paterson for his leadership and commitment to integrity in government and in the State Police specifically. Combining politics and police work is a toxic brew. Any questions about political interference within the State Police are a serious concern. Our investigation will determine whether or not this has occurred within the State Police, and if so to what extent. We will be purposeful and thorough in undertaking this inquiry. I will assemble a team dedicated to this effort and will update the governor on our progress periodically. We will follow the facts wherever they lead and we will get to the truth of the matter.
