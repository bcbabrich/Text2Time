Loyal readers of the Lede may have noticed that the blog hasnâ€™t been its normally robust self in recent days. Since the departure of Tom Zeller Jr., the editors have been plotting a new path; but the process has taken a bit longer than we had hoped.

Stay tuned, though.

Like the Terminator, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and the next 007 installment, the Lede blog will return.
