At a time when some rivals believe his best shots are behind him, Ilie Nastase is on a treadmill trying to fulfill his professional tennis commitments.

Since last Wednesday, Nastase has been in Los Angeles, Seattle and Phoenix for World Team Tennis matches and Las Vegas, Nev., for one round of a $250,000 tournament. Tonight, the 31-year-old Rumanian will be in Madison Square Garden with Chris Evert and members of the Los Angeles Strings for a team match against the New York Apples.

Until last Friday, Nastas ewas uncertain whether he would play here. He qualified and is committed contractually to play in the World Championship Tennis doubles finals this week in Kansas City and also has reached the W.C.T. singles finals next week in Dallas.

Under terms of his team‚Äêtennis contract, Nastase is not required to play any =itches until the W.C.T. season is compfeted. However, the anti ipation of a record league crowd for tonight's match with the Apples prompted league officials to lean on Nastase for support, and he was able to delay his first doubles match in Kansas City until Thursday.
