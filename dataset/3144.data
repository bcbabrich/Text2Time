To the Editor:

Daniel Zalewski's excellent review of Haruki Murakami's ''Underground'' (June 10) states that the book's methodology was borrowed from Studs Terkel. While Murakami has often written of the influence of writers like Raymond Carver on his own work, ''Underground'' most nearly resembles an earlier Japanese book about another horror, Masuji Ibuse's ''Black Rain,'' a ''documentary novel'' patched together from actual diaries of and interviews with survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
