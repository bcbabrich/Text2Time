Fruit of the Loom Inc., a unit of Farley Industries in Bowling Green, Ky., has named Warwick Baker O'Neill in New York to handle its North American apparel account, with billings estimated at $25 million. The account had been handled for four years by the Chicago and Toronto offices of the Leo Burnett Company until that agency resigned in October rather than take part in a review.

The review had been narrowed to Warwick Baker and two other finalists: Lois/EJL in Chicago, part of Lois/U.S.A., and Mezzina/Brown in New York. Warwick Baker handles the BVD apparel brand sold by Fruit of the Loom for the last 10 years.
