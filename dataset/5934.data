In his 20-year career at Aetna Life and Casualty in Hartford, Hoyt J. Goodrich figures he has invested about $4 billion of the insurance company's money. Now Mr. Goodrich has joined Donald P. Remey in a new company called Bridge Capital Advisors Inc. to do some investing on their own.

Mr. Goodrich, 46, said Bridge Capital would invest in private placement financings for small and medium-sized companies. ''We have an idea to help them out,'' he said.

The idea is a fixed rate loan at below market rates in exchange for which Bridge has the right to buy equity or to have a convertible feature. It is called debt with an equity play.

''We're not trying to be as risky as venture capital firms but we're on the aggressive side of what insurance companies have traditionally been doing,'' he said.
