A paralyzing transit strike was narrowly averted early yesterday morning at a cost that ,city officials feared they could not match for other public employees within the limits of the city's already shaky, financial plan.

Mayor Beame, who had been closeted with his advisers during a night of emotional discussions on what to do, appeared before the glare of television lights shortly before 5 A.M. and took pains to put distance between himself and the settlement.

The two‐year accord calls for no wage increase for the 34,000 transit workers. Instead, there is a cost‐of‐living adjustment tied in principle to unspecified productivity savings.

David L. Yunich, chairman of the Transit Authority, promised that “this contract will not trigger a fare increase in the foreseeable future,” and Mr. Beanie reiterated yesterday afternoon that Mr. Yunich had guaranteed that there would be no fare increase this year.
