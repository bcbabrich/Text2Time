IntercontinentalExchange, an online commodities trading company based in Atlanta, has offered to buy the International Petroleum Exchange in London, the world's second-largest oil futures market, in a bid to computerize it, the companies said today.

Under the deal, I.P.E. shareholders would receive stock valued at $75 million to $131 million in the privately held IntercontinentalExchange, a firm backed by several financial and oil companies, including Goldman Sachs and a BP Amoco unit.

The I.P.E., whose shares are traded through a private broker in London, was last valued at $43 million before trading of the shares was halted April 9 in anticipation of an offer.

The deal calls for the I.P.E. to switch to an online system within a year, leaving the London Metal Exchange as the last major European market to rely on floor traders to shout orders in a pit.
