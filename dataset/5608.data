Following are excerpts from a transcript of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington yesterday on the nomination of Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States, as recorded by The New York Times:

SENATOR HOWARD M. METZENBAUM, Democrat of Ohio: Mr. Justice: as this hearing develops I think it's on a double track. One part of the track - maybe a triple track - has to do with your ability to lead the Court, to be that individual who can weld the Court together. The second part relates to whether indeed you are an extremist and relates to some of your opinions. But there's a third part that probably disturbs me as much or maybe more than any of the first two portions. That has to do, and I want to use the most sensitive language I can, with your credibility, with the honesty of your representations to this body in 1971 and at the present time as well.

On the voter-challenge issue we have the matter of your making a specific representation to the committee at that time, and then we have the total disavowal yesterday with respect - as pertains to the facts, and that's an issue that is still left unanswered because the witnesses won't be here until tomorrow but it has to do not with whether you did or didn't do something but whether you did or did not represent the facts correctly to this body.

Then the second part of that whole credibility question relates to your answers to Senator Leahy yesterday that you didn't know of the typed-in restrictive covenant. This was a boilerplate form, had a typed-in restrictive covenant with reference to selling or leasing your property to any member of the Hebrew race.

Well, just as a - on its face sometimes typed in - a good lawyer, excellent scholar - certainly would have been normal to expect you would have noted that. And I guess as, as one of the most knowledgeable people that probably graduated Stamford - high honors - everybody agrees you're extremely intelligent, you don't have to be a - this whole thing almost stands out - Hebrew race. No such thing as a Hebrew race. It's a Hebrew religion. I mean that would obviously, a point that almost would stand out, and so when you say you didn't know about it, that concerns me. It's bad enough that it's in the deed. It's worse if it was in the deed and if you knew about it in your representation to the committee.
