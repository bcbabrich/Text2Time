''He was doing very well in treatment,'' Papy said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''His urine specimens had been negative. He had been participating in the treatment sessions. His disappearance surprised us.''

Strawberry was last seen about 10:45 p.m. Thursday after a drug-treatment session at the center. He was to walk to his apartment nearby, but instead he walked away, officials said. A probation officer waited for him until 2 a.m. Friday, then notified state and county authorities. A fugitive warrant was later issued by a Tampa judge, and a search was started.

''I don't even know what to say,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said of his former teammate. ''It's unfortunate. You hope that he's all right. But to be honest with you, I don't even know what to say.''

There had been talk of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, giving Strawberry some role in the organization -- a job in player development, perhaps, talking to young players about the perils of drugs, using his life as an example.

''I know George was going to give him an opportunity to work,'' Torre said. ''But unfortunately, I don't know what this does to that.''

Torre, who noted that he had not seen Strawberry since giving him his 1999 World Series ring last summer, said he had given him his cell phone number in case he ever wanted to talk. ''I want to be available to him,'' Torre added.

Rick Cerrone, the Yankees' spokesman, said he last saw Strawberry at the drug rehabilitation center on Feb. 17 and had found him upbeat. ''He seemed good,'' Cerrone said. ''I walked away very encouraged. His family was there.''
