UPDATE: The two men arrested for decorating Boston with cryptic electronic advertisements for the Cartoon Network’s popular animated show “Aqua Teen Hunger Force” were charged with disorderly conduct and, invoking a new state law in Massachusetts, according to Boston’s WCBV TV, with placing, transferring or possessing a hoax device that “results in panic.”

Streets and bridges in Boston were closed yesterday, and law enforcement mobilized, in a terror scare that lasted several hours, before authorities figured out that the devices were part of a guerrilla marketing campaign.

Sean Stevens, 28, and Peter Berdovsky, 27, pleaded not guilty and were released on $2,500 bond.

Meanwhile, the video of their exploits, which was originally on Mr. Berdovsky’s Web site, has now migrated to YouTube:

The larger story, according to Reuters — including the role of Turner Broadcasting, which apparently hired a New York marketing company to create the devices, which in turn hired the two men to place them around Boston — was still being investigated.

Mr. Stevens and Mr. Berdovsky were met outside the courthouse by fans of the Aqua Teen character that appeared on the devices — dubbed “Mooninites.” They reportedly held signs reading “Free Peter” and “1-31-07: Never Forget.”

But the two had little to say to reporters (perhaps on the advice of their attorney), according to Reuters, “insisting on talking about hairstyles from the 1970’s rather than addressing questions about the incident”:

“We are only taking questions on hair,” Mr. Berdovsky said.
