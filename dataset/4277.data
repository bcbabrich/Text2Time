To the Editor:

Frank Rich misses an important point in "The Radio Funnies" (column, Feb. 17), his criticism of the hiring of Curtis Sliwa by WNYC. Perhaps conservative views not only "have a right to be represented on WNYC," but are also necessary for the New York City station's survival.

I consider myself a conservative, yet I listen to WNYC more than to any other station because of the quality of its reporting. Yet no open-minded person will argue that WNYC does not give a slanted liberal viewpoint in its news and features.

Thomas Morgan, WNYC's president, must recognize this. Radio stations financed by this city cannot continue to ask for public money by catering only to its liberal constituents. Hence, Mr. Sliwa's hiring.

I am infuriated by many WNYC features and do not contribute when the station holds fund drives. However, I would consider doing so if it balanced its reporting with more conservative views. Maybe Mr. Morgan and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani understand this. PAUL M. SOLENICK White Plains, Feb. 21, 1994
