The tipoff came when the Bush people said the speech would be a "defining moment." That was what they had called the gulf war this time last year -- a "defining moment" -- and now they were recycling it to ballyhoo a speech.

They didn't even have any new phrases, for Pete's sake. How could they possibly have a new idea? Applying "defining moment" to that perennial brain-glazer, the State of the Union speech, should have told us how things stood: to wit, that this outfit is so sure it's home safe for another four years that it doesn't even feel the need for fresh bluster, much less a fresh thought.

As if to flaunt his contentment with last year's crowd-grabbers, the President addressed the economic recession with the same chilling words he used after Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait: "This will not stand."

What does this mean? That the recession is going to get Schwarzkopfed unless it comes to its senses and clears out of America pronto? Of course not. It means, "Prosperity is just around the corner."
