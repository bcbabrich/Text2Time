WISE--Cynthia, 69, died suddenly on Friday, September 26 in New York City, with her sister Barbara and niece Francesca at her side. After earning a B.A. at Connecticut College for Women and a M.A. at Northwestern University, Cynthia began her distinguished career at the African-American Institute, where she directed student and high-level educational programs for French-speaking African countries. She then lived in the Ivory Coast and Mauritania, where she directed various economic development programs. She later had a second career as a legal assistant and worked for many years at Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolfe & Cohen, P.C. where she was employed at the time of her death. Beloved for her quick humor, keen intelligence and kindness, Cynthia had a deep curiosity for other cultures and customs coupled with a love of travel and adventure. An avid lover of the arts, she was an officer of the Snarks Amateur Theater Company and thoroughly took full advantage of the cultural and culinary riches of New York. She will be deeply missed by her sister Barbara Wise, brother-in-law Robert Wilson, her daughter Helena Cullinan, granddaughters Olive and Minnie, her nieces Cristina Ciarrocchi and Francesca Ciarrocchi, and her many friends. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, October 7th at 3pm, at the Marble Collegiate Church, 29th Street and Fifth Avenue, Manhattan. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research or Bide-a-Wee Pet Welfare Organization.
