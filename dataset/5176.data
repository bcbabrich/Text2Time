The other statistics pointed down, led by a decrease in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods. That was followed by a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders, fewer orders for plants and equipment, fewer building permits and higher initial unemployment claims. Two other negative factors were faster vendor performance, meaning declining demand, and lower prices for sensitive materials, which indicated weakening demand. Index at 145% of Base

The various changes left the index at 145 percent of its 1982 base of 100. So far this year, the index has fallen at an annual rate of one-tenth of a percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent for the first nine months of 1988.

The economy has been slowing since the Federal Reserve Board acted last year stem inflation. But while inflation appears to be abating, the analysts said they were concerned that the Fed's grip could spur a recession.

Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch and other economists pointed to excessive inventories and slackening orders for durable goods, including less demand for new automobiles, as primary threats to the economy because both could lead to growing unemployment and stagnant growth. Trade Deficit Concerns

The economists are also concerned about the nation's trade deficit, which increased in August after falling for two straight months, and declining corporate profits, which could affect stock market prices.

Mr. Steinberg and Lawrence Chimerine, the senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group Inc., an economic forecasting group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., noted that the consumer confidence category was the primary positive indicator in the September index.

Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, accounted for much of this year's growth so far.
