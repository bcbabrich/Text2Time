WHILE the new CBS series ''Tour of Duty'' continues tonight to exploit the Vietnam story with standard war games and buddy stories, a made-for-TV movie on ABC at 9 P.M. makes a more oblique yet considerably more powerful attack on the same subject. ''Proud Men'' is set not in Vietnam but in the American Northwest. Charlton Heston plays Charley McLeod, a weathered, tradition-steeped cattle rancher who is told he is dying. His wife, Laura (Nan Martin), phones their son, an increasingly successful photographer in France, to come home. Charley Jr., portrayed by Peter Strauss, went AWOL 15 years earlier in Vietnam.

Written by Jeff Andrus, the script is uncomplicated. And the Von Zerneck-Samuels Production, directed by William Graham, is as attractively lean as an old-style western. But instead of trying to paper over a grueling experience with uplifting stories of battlefield heroics, ''Proud Men'' confronts painful realities that linger in the national psyche. The older Charley still disapproves of what his son did. He is still ashamed that his son, as he puts it, ''cut and run.'' And Charley Jr. is just as convinced that ''the thing was absurd - I swore an oath to my country, not to what was going on over there.'' Father and son are very much alike, two proud men, each convinced that he alone is right. Mr. Heston and Mr. Strauss bring them to life with strong and sensitive performances.

''Proud Men'' is strewn with cliches. When, for instance, Charley reveals that he might cut his son out of his will, Mom cries: ''This land has been in the McLeod family for three generations.'' But for the most part, the more predictable moments are handled well. Upon his return, Charley Jr. discovers that a good many people in the small town are not about to forget. There is much muttering about ''traitor'' and ''yellow-belly.'' But then there is the sweet old girlfriend, already divorced, who is willing to believe that Charley Jr. acted honorably, although she was never in favor of those war protesters who seemed to be ''cheering for the other side.''

When the older Charley takes a turn for the worse, Charley Jr. sends to Paris for his French wife and young son. Needless to say, the presence of his grandson, a cowboy fan, softens the old man considerably, even if the youngster can't speak English. Taking the boy out on horseback, Charley gives him a hot dog, assuring him that ''you take a bite out of that and you'll start talking American.'' In the end, the town toughs, the ones making a big issue about Charley Jr.'s ''cowardice,'' turn out to be nasty bigots against all ''outsiders.''
