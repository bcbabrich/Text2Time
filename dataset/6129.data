Donald J. Thorman; publisher of The National Catholic Reporter, a weekly newspaper published in Kansas City, Mo., And a principal spur to reform of the Roman Catholic Church in this country after the Ecumenical Council Vatican died of hepatitis yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City. He was 52 years old.

Since its founding by laymen in 1965, The Reporter has acquired a reputation as a paper uncowed by the church's sometimes conservative hierarchy and has published many articles, pro and con, on such controversial matters as birth control, priestly celibacy, the virginity of Mary and the morality of the Vietnam war.

In 1971, the newspaper weathered a crisis when its militantly reformist editor was discharged and its aggressively liberal policy was somewhat muted.

At the time, Mr. Thorman said that the paper's new “direction” was not a ‘'repudiation of the past.”
