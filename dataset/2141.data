When the Rangers were struggling to score earlier this season, losing mind-boggling games by scores of 1-0 or 2-1, their opponents were all too happy to pounce on their weakness.

Now, the Rangers are in the middle of a friendlier stretch, pouncing on other teams when they are down. On Thursday, they played an Islanders team whose goalie, Rick DiPietro, clearly needs a break. They knocked four goals by him while he was consistently — and uncharacteristically — out of position. Then on Saturday, they met an Ottawa team that can barely get out of its own way in a six-game losing streak and won 5-2.

Coming on Monday is a date with Carolina, which prepared for its trip to Madison Square Garden by getting waxed, 8-1, by Buffalo Saturday night.



Predictably, the Rangers are not gloating about any of this. They were particularly kind in their assessment of Ottawa, the once-and-probably-future power team in the Eastern Conference.

“Ottawa, I think, it having a bit of a tough stretch right now as everybody does,” said Rangers Coach Tom Renney. “And we respect that as much as anybody because we’ve been through that. That’s hockey. So if there’s a gap that’s been closed, it’s a combination of we played better and they’re having a bit of a tough time right now.”

Clearly, though, the Rangers are figuring some things out. Jaromir Jagr has scored in three straight games. Brendan Shanahan scored twice against Ottawa to give himself nine goals for the season. The power play has stopped looking like a Three Stooges routine and has scored four goals in two games.

So instead of showering pity on the Senators Saturday, they decided to feel good about themselves.

“It’s good for us, knowing we can come up here and play a very solid game,” said goalie Henrik Lundqvist. “We haven’t won that many times up here. I’m very happy the way we played, not just for the two points. The way we played in the first period I think was the best so far this year.”
