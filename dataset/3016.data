The quilts that represented Rosie Lee Tompkins in the Whitney Biennial last spring did not do her work full justice. But its greatness shines forth undiluted in her New York gallery debut, which shows 11 quilts dating from 1986 to 2002. Unerring and intuitive in their sense of color, shape and scale, Ms. Tompkins's quilts are formidably joyful visual events that ignore the usual boundaries between cultures, histories and mediums.

They belong to the history of European modernism and African-American quilting, 20th-century textiles and 20th-century painting. They connect to African textiles, especially the bark cloth paintings of the Kuba and the Ituri of Central Africa, and also to music. Their improvisational finesse has been rightly compared to jazz, but Bach's spiritual architectonics are also pertinent.

Their animated compositions have been likened to the paintings of Hans Hofmann, Alfred Jensen and Howard Hodgkin; but Josef Albers, Stuart Davis, Klee and late Mondrian also come to mind. So do the trippy mutating arrangements of computer artists like John R. Simon, the textiles of Anni Albers and the little-known appliqu√© paintings of Eve Peri.

Ms. Tompkins was born in 1936, lives in the Bay Area and uses a pseudonym to protect her privacy. She learned her craft as a child in eastern Arkansas helping her mother piece quilts, and says that God guides her work. Although known to specialists in African and African-American art since the early 1990's, her achievement was brought to wider art world attention by Lawrence Rinder, who organized a show of her work at the art museum at the University of California at Berkeley in 1997 and then put it in the 2002 Whitney Biennial.
