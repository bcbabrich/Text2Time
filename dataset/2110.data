Alan Weisman’s book “The World Without Us” is a 324-page thought experiment: What would happen to the Earth if humans ceased to exist? The work, published in June, is not a science-fiction novel, but rather a thoroughly researched, scientifically grounded account of how the environment — natural and built — would change if people were no longer around.

One chapter in the book, “The City Without Us,” is particularly relevant — if depressing — for New Yorkers. It portrays a city robbed of its eight million people, submerged by water from below, then ravaged by devastating fires, and finally overgrown with vegetation. The Web site for the book has a fascinating slide show depicting New York City’s fate, from two days to 15,000 years after the disappearance of humans.



In a phone interview with Mr. Weisman, a journalist who has written extensively about science, he told us why he chose Manhattan as his case study of a city without humans:

Manhattan Island kind of epitomizes urbanity. The thought of all this concrete and steel reverting to forest is unthinkable, and yet it turns out there was a forest there before. My question when I went to New York – and it’s a question I posed to civil engineers, architects, climatologists, botanists and biologists — was: Could the city ever revert to a forest again? And the unanimous conclusion was: Absolutely. Not only would it, but it will.

The book’s chapter on New York begins with Eric W. Sanderson, a landscape ecologist who directs the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Mannahatta Project, an attempt to recreate, through computer simulations, what Manhattan Island looked like when Henry Hudson first saw it in 1609. (Bottom line, the island was much more watery then.)

What follows in the chapter is an explanation of how that landscape, fairly untouched until the arrival of Europeans, would quickly reestablish itself if humans were gone. For starters, subway tunnels — which are kept dry because of a system of pumps that remove 13 million gallons of water each day — would flood. (This already happens when heavy rains drench the city, as occurred on Aug. 8.) Without the pumps, water would fill the subway system in a couple of days; clogged sewers would overflow, flooding the street surface. “Within 20 years, the water-soaked steel columns that support the street above the East Side’s 4, 5, and 6 trains corrode and buckle,” Mr. Weisman writes. “As Lexington Avenue caves in, it becomes a river.”

Even now, the freeze-thaw cycle creates cracks in the city sidewalk that weeds quickly fill. Without maintenance workers to pull up those weeks, the roots of the powerful and hardy ailanthus tree would heave up sidewalks and wreak havoc on sewers.

“Starting with the mulch collecting in gutters, a layer of soil will start forming atop New York’s sterile hard shell, and seedlings will sprout,” Mr. Weisman writes.

Skeptical? Look no farther than the High Line, the abandoned segment of elevated railroad track in Manhattan. Trains stopped running there in 1980, and ailanthus trees quickly emerged — joined by onion grass, lamb’s ear, goldenrod, crocuses, irises, evening primrose, asters and Queen Anne’s lace. This “untended, flowering green ribbon,” Mr. Weisman notes, is now scheduled to become a park.

Without heating and air-conditioning, Manhattan’s skyscrapers would expand and contract with the cold and hot weather. Joints between walls and roof lines would separate, rain would enter, bots would rust, facades would pop off and insulation would be exposed. Dry lightning would ignite dead branches and leaves. Gas lines would catch fire.

Within 200 years of humans’ disappearance, Mr. Weisman writes, “colonizing trees will have substantially replaced pioneer weeds.”

Buildings would collapse, their crushed concrete raising the pH levels of the soil beneath, good news for trees that need less acidic environments. With stronger and more frequent hurricanes buffering the Atlantic coast, unsteady structures would be toppled by the wind. Without constant painting and maintenance, bridges would corrode and buckle.

“Gradually, the asphalt jungle will give way to a real one,” Mr. Weisman writes.

(Curious detail: Contrary to the conventional wisdom, he writes, without our heated buildings and garbage, the cockroaches and rats would quickly freeze and starve to death.)

Some of the most intriguing observations in the chapter concern the durability and permanence of modern glass and steel buildings. Such buildings would not survive long without constant human maintenance, according to Mr. Weisman. In contrast, older stone buildings like Grand Central Terminal and St. Paul’s Chapel (“built in 1766 from Manhattan’s own hard schist”) would be among New York’s most enduring monuments. So would bank vaults, which are built for strength.

Mr. Weisman said he did not expect, when he set out on his research, to discover that the soaring edifices of Manhattan are in fact quite fragile. “It was a surprise to me, when I started talking to people, to find out that cities can and will collapse, particularly cities that are not made out of big, immense chunks of stone,” he said in the interview. “Our construction just isn’t that durable.”

If you think that climate change is the greatest environmental threat to humanity, you might find this observation from the book sobering: “Three times in the past 100,000 years, glaciers have scraped New York clean. Unless humankind’s Faustian affair with carbon fuels ends up tipping the atmosphere past the point of no return, and runaway global warming transfigures Earth into Venus, at some unknown date glaciers will do so again.”

“The World Without Us” paints a fairly grim portrait. (Reviewing the work in The Times, Janet Maslin called it “punishingly bleak,” while Jennifer Schuessler, writing in The Times Book Review, described it as “morbidly fascinating.”)

A core trait of “The World Without Us” is that it is neither preachy nor sentimental. The closest Mr. Weisman comes to a policy prescription is toward the end of the book, where he discusses, but does not endorse, the idea that human population growth should be curbed to save the planet — a point of view espoused, in its most radical form, by the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.

Mr. Weisman said he did not agree with the aims of the movement (whose motto is “Live long and die out”). “We are a species that does deserve to be here,” he said in the interview. “The whole idea of the human race being some cancer or acne on the planet — I don’t buy that.” If anything, he said, the book affirms the necessity of people he interviewed, like hydraulics workers and bridge engineers, whose daily work literally keeps New York City standing.

Mr. Weisman has done several public readings. Surprisingly, he said, many readers have said they found the book “oddly comforting and hopeful,” in that it argues that humans’ (often destructive) influence on the environment can be reversed, with enough time, and that life is resilient.

“Even if it has to be without us, many people — frankly, me included — find a measure of peace in the notion that life will go on,” Mr. Weisman said.

And some readers, he added, have even found a dark humor in the apocalyptic portrayal.

Said Mr. Weisman: “You’d be surprised at the number of New Yorkers who’ve said, ‘God, I love it when you let nature trash Manhattan.'”
