Artillery shelling and automatic gunfire shook this south Lebanon port city today as Christian forces battled Moslem militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas for a third day.

At least 51 people have been killed and more than 140 wounded in the weekend of violence, according to police reports.

The heaviest toll was in Sidon, but in the hills around Beirut, artillery exchanges between the Lebanese Army garrison at Suk al Gharb and Druse gunners killed five people and wounded eight Saturday night and early today, according to police reports.

The Lebanese police said four people were killed and six wounded today in battles pitting Lebanese Army troops, Moslem militiamen and Palestinians against Christians of the Lebanese Forces militia in the hills east of Sidon.
