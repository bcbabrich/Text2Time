THE term Plain Jane does not exactly describe Jane Krakowski before she transforms herself into the kittenish Carla in the musical ''Nine.'' She has plenty of material to work with: soft green eyes, a mouth that easily warms to a pout or a pucker, and the sort of luminous skin that looks as if she bathes in milk.

Still, to become Carla, Ms. Krakowski, a Tony nominee for best featured actress in a musical, must put on a 1960's face -- specifically, the 1960's of iron lashes, opulent eye shadow and brows arching toward a bubble of teased hair. Think of Monica Vitti, or Ursula Andress around the time she made ''What's New, Pussycat?'' It is a distinctly European kind of glamour, heavy with worldly sin and sophistication, and strikingly different from the teenage innocence of Broadway's other big 60's show this season, ''Hairspray.''

Speaking to my reflection in her dressing room mirror at the Eugene O'Neill Theater about an hour before curtain one evening, Ms. Krakowski begins to put on her face. Before her, on the vanity, are makeup brushes, jars of powder and four eye shadows, two of them coal black. She works so calmly, concentrating on her right eye as she talks, that when she stops, puts down her brush and turns toward me, I am momentarily stunned. Her right eye is now a smoldering pool of black -- Carla -- while her left eye, the one I saw in the mirror, is still sweetly and unmistakably Jane.

Ms. Krakowski calls her makeup ''a shadowing of a mask'' that, combined with her nearly nude costume, gives her license to play Carla without inhibition. ''I feel more empowered when I have it all on,'' she says, pointing out that, under the stage lights, her blackened eyes have the extra kick of making her skin appear whiter and her dress, if it's possible, even more nude.
