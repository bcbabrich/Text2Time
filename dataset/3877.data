To the Editor:

''Looking Back in Central Europe'' (editorial, Aug. 26) correctly points out the inherent dangers of reliance upon Communist secret police files. Without an adequate filter in place to monitor the admissibility of evidence, the judicial systems of Central Europe risk a reversion to the very practices of injustice that they fought so hard to shed in 1989.

Although derided by some as over-protective of criminals' rights, the Federal Rules of Evidence in the United States has evolved into a formidable legal device for keeping tainted evidence out of the courtroom.

If Central Europe is ever to escape its haunted past, it must abandon its dependence upon a Kafkaesque legal system. Instead of looking back, these countries need to look forward, toward the rule of law and due process, and they need to begin doing that today.
