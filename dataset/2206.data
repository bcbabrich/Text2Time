CALIFORNIA: $15 MILLION TO FIGHT GANG VIOLENCE Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales announced a $15 million plan to fight gang violence in several cities. Mr. Gonzales announced the program in Los Angeles at a mayoral meeting. "To have enduring success against gangs, we must address the personal, family and community factors that cause young people to choose gangs over better, more productive alternatives," he said. "This new program brings together three essential strategies in the fight against gangs, prevention, prosecution and prisoner re-entry." The cities, Cleveland, Dallas, Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Tampa, Fla., will each be given $2.5 million. (AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE)

COLORADO: MINT TO PAY $9 MILLION IN SEX BIAS CASE The government has agreed to pay $9 million to female employees of the Denver Mint to settle complaints of sex discrimination, harassment and retaliation, officials said. The accord, which requires approval by a judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, calls for the appointment of an independent monitor at the Mint for three years, said Becky Bailey, a spokeswoman. The complaint was filed in 2003 by 32 women who said that pornography was openly displayed at the plant and that women were subjected to unwanted advances and sexual discrimination. The Mint denied liability but wanted to avoid the expense and delay of hearings and other proceedings, Ms. Bailey said. (AP)
