Official confirmation of a 24‐hour New Year's Day bombing halt throughout all of Vietnam was expected from the United States command in Saigon. Spokesmen for the command were refusing to confirm the pause during the day, apparently following a pattern established when the command announced a 36‐hour Christmas pause after it had passed. The pause was in observance of a New Year's Day cease‐fire proclaimed by both the Communists and the Saigon Government. [Page 1, Column 8.]

There were clear signs in Washington that President Nixon's halt in the bombing of North Vietnam above the 20th Parallel had brought him little, if any, respite from Congressional criticism of his Vietnam policies.
