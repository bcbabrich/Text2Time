Nanette Rainone, who as a reporter and programmer at the New York radio station WBAI in the late 1960s and early ’70s created some of the first programs dedicated to feminism and women’s issues, died on May 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.

The cause was complications of breast cancer, her son, Bruno Blumenfeld, said.

Ms. Rainone (pronounced ray-KNOWN) was a volunteer at the station in 1969 when she developed the idea for “Womankind,” a feminist news and information radio show that included interviews.

At the time, feminism was struggling to earn a place in left-wing politics, where radical ideas still coexisted with sexist attitudes. Ms. Rainone hoped to overcome this paradox, taking a point of view shaped by her membership in groups like the Feminists and New York Radical Feminists.

She soon added “Electra Rewired,” a program produced entirely by women for women. It was broadcast live at night and ran until dawn, with listeners calling in to discuss the topics addressed by the host, Liza Cowan, and her guests.
