With Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who is from Nassau County and is seeking his second term in Congress, Mr. O'Rourke heads a ticket that includes a veteran who was the last link to the Rockefeller era, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who lives in Katonah, Westchester County, and two newcomers to state politics, Nassau County Comptroller Peter T. King, the candidate for attorney general, and District Attorney E.

Pirro, an assistant district attorney there, had not dropped out of the race after two days, as suddenly as she dropped in.
