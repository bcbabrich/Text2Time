The Soviet press has not given general currency to the persistent speculation abroad that the assassination of President Kennedy was the result of a plot.

It has never publicly acknowledged that Oswald spent some time in the Soviet Union.

After the immediate flush of excitement that followed the murder of the President, there has been no concerted effort of the part of newspapers here to represent the assassination as the result of a dark conspiracy instigated by rightwingers because of Mr. Kennedy's efforts to improve the international climate between East and West.

Communist party propagandists are apparently reconciled to the prevalent view that Oswald carried out the assassination without any accomplice and that the killing of Oswald was the work of one man, Ruby, and not, as Soviet papers hinted at first, staged with the connivance of the Dallas police.

This general press policy, however, has not prevented the occasional reprinting of Western speculation in Soviet newspapers.
