John McMullen said yesterday he feels confident that Puck Holdings, an affiliate of the Yankee-Nets, will complete its $175 million acquisition of his Devils by Aug. 31.

''They'll lose $30 million if they don't do it,'' he said, referring to the ''breakup fee'' due him from Puck if the deal collapses.

He called Aug. 31 ''the dor-or-die date.''

During a news conference at ''21'' where the Devils' Stanley Cup made a tour stop, McMullen said the buyers ''are making every effort.'' But he said it would be easy to take over the team if the acquisition falls apart.

''By that time, the season will be ready to start, we have our roster stablilized and the team will be ready to go,'' he said, adding that if Puck Falters, he would not seek another buyer. ''Then it's over,'' he said.
