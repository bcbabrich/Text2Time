Moreover, there is something about the Sumerians' having been the first people to have written about love and death, fear and jealousy, science and technology, the stars, weather, marriage, war and countless other human interests that seems to have lent this ancient people great charm as well as historical importance.

To a Sumerologist, the fact that few scholars can actually read Sumerian (only 750 copies of the first volume of the dictionary have been printed, at $40 each) is the world's bad luck rather than a sign of the limited appeal of their field.

Superficially, said Prof. Samuel Noah Kramer, the 87-year-old dean of Sumerian literary studies and a consultant to the dictionary staff, a project like the Sumerian dictionary, which has five other editors besides Dr. Sjoberg and which has been given grants of more than $1 million since it began in 1976, is an elitist enterprise.

But Dr. Kramer said, ''In the long run, it will be something that is of significance for everyone.'' Knowledge of Sumerian literature, he suggested, could be useful to a most anti-elitist view of human history. ''You can look up all this stuff about slavery, about the poor, about the oppressed, about oligarchies.''

Prof. Erle Leichty, an Assyriaologist, is the dictionary's co-editor. The other editors are Hermann Behrens, Barry L. Eichler, Margaret W. Green and Darlene M. Loding.

The University of Pennsylvania has been a center of ancient Mesopotamian studies for a century. The first American archeological expedition to the area was organized in 1887. That expedition led to the first excavations of the holy Sumerian city of Nippur, in 1888, and in the decades that followed archeologists from the university museum brought home some 30,000 clay tablets that are still being studied.

More recently, a succession of Iraqi governments has sometimes made it difficult for American scholars to pursue their Mesopotamian researches on the scene. But several scholars today expressed cautious optimism that it may be easier to visit Iraq now that the United States and Iraq have resumed diplomatic relations, which were severed in 1967.
