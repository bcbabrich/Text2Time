A New Jersey police officer here for a law enforcement conference was arrested yesterday after a six-mile chase and charged with robbing a bank, The Associated Press reported.

The suspect, Christopher J. Kerins, 39, a 13-year veteran of the Trenton police, was charged with one count each of robbery, fleeing and eluding, and felonious assault on a police officer, said Col. Dan Wolfangel of the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office.

Officer Kerins, a resident of Yardville, N.J., was being held without bond.

Colonel Wolfangel said that about 1:55 P.M., a man entered the Kenwood Savings Bank in suburban Sycamore Township and asked tellers for directions. He pushed a bag under the tellers' glass, showed a handgun and demanded they fill the bag with money. He then fled in a car with New Jersey license plates, the colonel said.

After a chase in which an officer shot out a tire, the suspect pointed a gun at an officer before being arrested, the colonel said.
