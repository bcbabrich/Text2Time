Salavat Yulaev Ufa, the top team in Russia and, until this week, the World Club Top 10, did not exactly cover itself in glory over the holiday break. The Bashkir club lost twice to a team of European-based Canadians at the Spengler Cup tournament in Davos, Switzerland, including a defeat in the championship game. Even though both losses were by a single goal, Salavatâ€™s performance can only be counted as an embarrassment to what had been considered the strongest side on the continent.

As it happens, Detroit Red Wings surged past Salavat to No. 1 in the Top 10. These are the rankings, through Dec. 31, 2007.
