Wallace Groves, whose Wall Street career ended in the 1930's when he was convicted for mail fraud and who then went on to develop the city of Freeport in the Bahamas into a major resort and gambling area, died Saturday at Doctors Hospital in Miami, six days after suffering a stroke. He was 86 years old.

Mr. Groves essentially had two business lives. First, as a young, flashy, and successful investor, he was involved in several businesses and had controlling interests in several others, including the United Cigar Store and the Whelan Drug Store chain. Spent 2 Years in Prison

But he was indicted in 1938 and convicted in 1941 of using the mails to defraud stockholders in the General Investment Corporation, which he controlled. He had been accused of using the mails in a scheme to sell securities to General Investment at an inflated price. Mr. Groves spent two years in Federal prison.

Late in the 1940's, Mr. Groves became interested in Grand Bahama Island, the long, narrow strip at the northwest edge of the island group. He bought 114,000 acres at $2.80 an acre.
