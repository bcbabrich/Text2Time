I always knew I was special. And now research from San Diego State University proves that I am just as unique as everybody else: I and my collegiate peers are 30 percent more narcissistic than the fluffy-haired and spandex-clad college students of 1982.

I’m not sure how something like this is measured, but apparently our inflated self-confidence follows us into the workplace. In an article entitled “The Most-Praised Generation Goes to Work” [$], Jeffrey Zaslow of The Wall Street Journal explores this “culture of praise,” noting an increase in the need for approval among workers in their 20s and the hiring of corporate “celebration assistants,” who help teach managers to compliment young employees with encouraging e-mail, prizes and “public displays of appreciation.”

Now, I enjoy a compliment on a job well done; no one likes to go unnoticed. But I don’t know that I require more praise than older people in order to perform the same level of work.

It may be true that our parents tended to over- rather than under-praise us. But I suspect that it is simply feedback, rather than praise, that my age group craves. I can’t speak for more than a handful of my friends and myself, but I know that I feel anxious when I have no inkling of how I’m doing. Growing up with the Internet embedded in my daily life, I’m used to hearing from people constantly. When I hear nothing, my hyper-connected self assumes that I’m performing at a mediocre level, if not doing something wrong.

Online, everything is instantaneously judged. Anyone who has access to a computer has a voice, and everyone’s opinion can be recorded. Being able to post amateur photographs or writing and receive comments from anonymous readers in Japan and Kansas contributes to an inflated ego.

Yet a touch of cynicism taints the complimentary experience. In a world where people can become famous by videotaping themselves stuffing a record number of marshmallows into their mouths, it’s hard to take praise seriously. Public attention and affection seems to be shifting away from the accomplished and toward the abnormal.

The striking downside to an institutionalized celebration assistant is that workers may no longer feel unique or singled out for their work. If it’s someone’s job to tell you that you’re fabulous, and if your cubicle-mates are also regularly showered with confetti, the praise rings hollow. Specific, content-driven feedback is what we need, not praise for simply showing up to work or performing a basic job requirement.

Do employers truly consider us thinner-skinned than previous generations? I think we’re merely more high-strung. With colleges graduating more and better-educated students than in years past, the competition for even entry-level positions can be fierce. It’s become increasingly difficult to turn down any opportunities that fall in front of us. So we’re taking on responsibilities earlier in our lives than our elders did.

A good friend who had an internship the summer leading up to his senior year received a job offer starting in the fall, when he was still busy completing his last semester of schoolwork. As he thumbed through his Blackberry after – and frequently during – class, his furrowed brow and frazzled demeanor belied his image as a calm professional. In fact, he felt trapped by his opportunity; he couldn’t turn it down, regardless of the toll it took on his personal life.

The weight of responsibilities like these adds up, as each one is precariously balanced. While we’re building our platforms to become the Professional American 2.0, taking on the jobs that society offers, maybe we need reassuring feedback in order to cope.

Is a little bit of ego-stroking too much to ask?
