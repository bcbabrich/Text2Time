Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students examine promotional products for movies and brainstorm the ways that these items affect their purchasing behavior. Students then consider the profiles of specific consumer demographics and create posters explaining why a specific age group is a viable audience for specific advertisers. Finally, students will prove or disprove the profiles they developed by finding and analyzing real advertisements targeted to their assigned consumer demographic.

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Examine movie product tie-in samples and consider how they affect personal opinions about the products involved in these particular advertising campaigns.

2. Consider the trend of promoting movies through popular consumer products by reading and discussing the article “Summer Movie Tie-Ins Arriving Early.”

3. Develop profiles for specific age groups and determine which products and companies will profit the most from advertising to each particular demographic; create persuasive posters.

4. Compare the profiles and advertising concepts developed in their groups with real television and print advertisements geared to the target audience.

Resources / Materials:

-samples of movie product tie-ins, such as figurines, cups, posters, clothing, party decorations, etc. (minimum of five; preferably different types of products)

-pens/pencils

-paper

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “Summer Movie Tie-Ins Arriving Early” (one per student)

-construction paper (one piece per student)

-markers or colored pencils (enough for students to share)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, arrange desks in to as many groups as there are samples of movie product tie-ins available, and place one item in the center of each grouping. Upon entering class, students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “What is a ‘tie-in’? What type of tie-in product does your group have? What age group does this item interest, and why? What is the consumer ‘getting’ by having this product? Does this product make you want to see the related movie more? Why or why not? Does it make you want to buy more of this particular product? Why or why not?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers within their small groups and then with the class. As a class, discuss: Why might movie companies promote their movies through tie-ins such as those seen in class? What other types of companies typically use tie-ins to promote their goods or services? What other tie-in samples do the students in the classroom have with them, and why did they purchase these items rather than similar items that are not promotional?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Summer Movie Tie-Ins Arriving Early,” focusing on the following questions:

a. How many movies will be released during the 2003 summer movie season?

b. With what does Susan Nunziata compare the movie promotions discussed in the article?

c. What are the three negative results saturating the market, according to the article?

d. How many cross-marketing campaigns has Tanqueray gin done prior to the 2003 summer movie season?

e. With what values does Tanqueray associate itself?

f. According to Russell Weiner, how are movie brands and product brands joined together? What is an example of this joining?

g. According to Jeff Bell, how do BBDO and the Arnell Group decide which brands should be packaged with Jeep products?

h. According to Mr. Bell, what is the ideal scenario for a marketing campaign?

i. What connection do marketers make between buying behavior and weather?

3. Divide students into six groups. Explain that each group is going to act as an advertising agency representing a specific age group. Each agency will be responsible for creating a profile of this age group and then for designing posters that inform other agencies why this age group is a perfect target audience for particular consumer products of their choice. Assign each group to a particular age demographic, such as elementary school children, teenagers, college students, young professionals, middle aged adults and the elderly.

First, allow each group approximately 10 minutes to develop a profile of their assigned demographic group by answering the following questions (written on the board for easier student access):

–What is the approximate age range for people in this demographic group?

–What are the typical characteristics of people in this age group?

–What are the interests of this age group?

–What is their source of income?

–What might be their greatest social and economic concerns?

–What issues regarding products might be important to them?

–Where would they do the majority of shopping? (online, mega-stores, boutiques, etc.)

–What types of products do you think are targeted to this audience?

After the group completes their profile, each group member will imagine that he or she is a part of an advertising team hailed as experts for the group’s assigned demographic. Individually, each student will choose a different company or product that would likely benefit from advertising to the group’s assigned age group. Each student should begin by choosing a company or product, such as a soda company, fast food chain, etc. He or she then will have ten to fifteen minutes to create a poster on a piece of construction paper “selling” this demographic group to this particular company. On the poster, students should be sure to include aspects of the demographic profile created by the whole group to express natural connections between audience and product, as well as important spokespeople or types of advertising (print media, commercials, instant messages, etc.) that can help to make this company’s or product’s advertising more meaningful. It is acceptable to target companies that already market to this particular demographic, but whenever possible, students should expand their ideas to include products and companies that are not familiar to the demographic, as well as advertising strategies and mediums that may not currently be used.

After posters are completed, students will present them to their assigned groups. During these brief presentations, group members should consider the value of this company or product to their assigned age group and take notes on how effective each idea could be. After all students have presented, the group will vote on the two or three (depending on group size) strongest products or companies that deserve the business of their assigned demographic.

The class should then reconvene, and students should reflect on their group work, focusing on the following questions: How are ties between a particular demographic and a particular company or product formed? What might affect this relationship? What is the most effective way to reach each demographic? Why?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students should watch television or look through newspapers and magazines to find advertisements that are obviously targeted to their assigned demographic. Then, each student should write an analysis comparing the profile created during class the actual ads found in the consumer marketplace. In a future class, students should display their posters and discuss their homework findings and analyses.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is the “law of diminishing returns”?

–Why are summer movies more popular for large marketing campaigns than movies released at other times during the year?

–Why is New York’s advertising industry called “Madison Avenue”?

–How do particular products get placed in movies and on television?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on thoughtful journal entries, participation in class and group discussions, meaningful posters illustrating which companies or products best fit their assigned demographics, clear presentations to their group and the class, and thorough analysis of advertisements geared to their assigned age demographics.

Vocabulary:

lucrative, barrage, cineplexes, frenetic, indicative, blitz, transcend, graver, cacophonous, dovetail, inundated

Extension Activities:

1. Interview a representative from an advertising agency mentioned in the article read in class or from a local agency. How does a concept go from being just an idea to an actual print or television commercial? Write a newspaper article explaining your findings.

2. Create a jingle for a company that was chosen by your assigned demographics group. Make sure to include qualities that would appeal to the profile of your age group. Present jingles in a future class and evaluate their potential effectiveness.

3. Design an ad campaign for a popular product and a movie that is coming out for the 2003 summer movie season. What are the connections between the two? Who is the target audience, and why? What other promotional items might this movie consider?

4. Write a research paper exploring the history of name-brand products that appear in movies or on television. When did name brands like Coca-Cola replace generic cans of soda? Why? When did movies begin to take advantage of product placement? How do product placements impact your viewing of a movie or television show as an audience member?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Create an exhibit about a famous American advertising campaign, such as Uncle Sam or Rosie the Riveter. Historically, what was happening in the United States during the time of this campaign? Why was this campaign so memorable? Who was targeted by this campaign? What was being “sold” by this campaign?

Civics- Write a research paper examining copyright laws as they relate to consumer products and major motion pictures. What does the law require when a name brand is bundled for marketing campaigns? Why can’t a product be used in a film without permission? How must this product be used?

Economics- Choose a popular consumer item, such as McDonald’s fast food, Nike sneakers, Jeep cars or Coca-Cola products. Create a pie chart illustrating how marketing dollars were spent on this product over the past year, and evaluate your findings.

Fine Arts- Create a print advertisement that illustrates weak product bundling, such as a Rugrats movie with Tanqueray gin or denture cream to teenagers.
