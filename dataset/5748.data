The subsidiary honors that come to the holder of high Federal office sometimes seem endless. When he was in Birmingham, Ala., last month for a speech, Francis S. M. Hodsoll, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, was made a member of the Possum Growers and Breeders Association of America and, in turn, pledged himself to ''educate the general public as to the value of the Didelphis virginiana as a source of highly nutritious and palatable food and quality fur.'' In what might seem a contradictory mission to some, the association is also dedicated to promoting the opossum as a pet.
