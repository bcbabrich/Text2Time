WILLY is a thief and a scoundrel, and if he were to be dealt a little Smith & Wesson justice, the world woud be richer by the absence of one skulking blue jay.

The trouble is, he doesn’t know he's a bully, an ornithological tyrant and a stickybilled robber. What's worse, he thinks that all the bird seed I set out in various bird feeders are for his delectation alone. This is not so.

I cannot remember when he wasn’t around, so he's been free‐loading off me for quite awhile. In the warm months, he isn’t so apparent; he's off doing whatever it is these raucous‐voiced creatures do when the air is balmy. But it must be something illegal.

Recently, I noticed a beautiful cardinal perched in a spruce tree in my front yard, looking forlorn and hungry, and I realized it was time to start feeding birds.
