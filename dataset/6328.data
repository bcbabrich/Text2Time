SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Jan. 2 — Dinner had been scheduled for 6:30 in the Ban quet Room of the Santa Bar bara Inn, where the Kansas City Chiefs have been lodged this week. When the steaks were slow in arriving last night, most of the Chiefs were con tent to watch the Orange Bowl game on the color TV set perched atop a table.

But two players, willine Lanier and Jerry Mays, refused to wait. Lanier disappeared quietly, Mays in a storm of annoyance.

“I just didn't want to sit around,” Lanier, the middle linebacker, said later in the lobby. “It just bugged me.”

“It made me mad,” Mays, defensive end, said as he strode quickly through a hallway. “I'm going out to have dinner.”
