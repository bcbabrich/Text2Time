David Van Vactor, a flutist, conductor and composer, died on March 24 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 87.

The probable cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Virginia.

Mr. Van Vactor was born in Plymouth, Ind., and received a bachelor of music degree from Northwestern University, where he later taught. He also studied flute in Vienna and composition in Paris with Paul Dukas. Upon his return from Europe, he joined the Civic Orchestra of Chicago and then the Chicago Symphony. In 1947 he was appointed conductor of the Knoxville Symphony in Tennesee, a post he held for 25 years. He also founded the fine arts department at the University of Tennessee, where he was later a professor emeritus of composition.

Mr. Van Vactor wrote symphonies, concertos, vocal music and chamber works, many of which have been performed by the National Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony and other orchestras. His Symphony in D was given its premiere by the New York Philharmonic in 1939 after winning first prize in a contest sponsored by the orchestra.

In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, David Landreth Van Vactor, and a stepson, Eric Goodheart, both of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Raven Harwood, and a stepdaughter, Jessica Goodheart, both of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
