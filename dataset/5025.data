The United States Postal Service will appeal to the sentiments of viewers of the NBC program "L.A. Law" tonight when it screens its new network campaign for the first time.

The spot, which uses the old adage about sleet and rain, intercuts images of loyal postal workers battleing bad weather with pictures of the main Post Office branch in New York City. The idea is to focus on the side of the building, where the famous postal poem is carved. It is questionable, however, whether the carved words are legible enough for the spot's intent.

The ad, created by Young & Rubicam, New York, also emphasizes the postal service's technology, and calls on people to help enhance service by using a complete address.

"The objective is to communicate that the postal service is doing everything it can to improve itself," said Rich Kahn, senior vice president and group director at Young & Rubicam.
