As part of our Cowboys-Giants lollapalooza weekend, we’ll post some snippets and links of coverage from around the nation. This entry focuses on the dreaded players-only meeting — a close cousin of the dreaded vote of confidence.

Headline: New York is on the brink — a loss would push it over

Excerpt:

Their 6-5 record and butt ugly three-game losing streak aside, you knew the Giants had reached the desperation stage this week when the news came that they had called the dreaded “players only” team meeting, always the last resort of a club whose season has been pushed to the brink. It’s the football equivalent of whipping out the defibrillator paddles and administering a quick electric shock to the heart of a locker room. If it works, you can bring a season back to life and save the day. But if it doesn’t, it’s just another empty and futile gesture along the road to ruin. “If they lose, could it come unraveled for the Giants as quickly as everyone has said it could?” said Randy Cross, the former 49ers offensive lineman and veteran NFL game analyst for CBS. “Yeah. If you’re a pessimist, right now you could say Eli [Manning] has fish eyes, Tiki [Barber] is already a journalist, [Michael] Strahan hasn’t even played in a month, and Plaxico [Burress] is just being Plax. But all of that is from the outside. “Because if the Giants win this game against Dallas, 99.9 percent of all this stuff goes away and gets on the charter back to Dallas with the Cowboys. If they’re tied, but the Giants are 4-0 in the division and have swept Dallas this season, with the Cowboys being 1-4 in the division, who’s got the hammer now?”

I’m not sure if Jean-Jacques Taylor of The Dallas Morning News realizes this, but he might have written himself off Tom Coughlin’s Christmas card list:

Headline: Never have the Giants Been So Vulnerable

Excerpt:

The players might rally around each other – they did have a players-only team meeting this week – and play for themselves in Sunday’s winner-take-all battle for the NFC East title, but they’re not going to storm the field and play as hard as they can to win one for Tom. Can you blame them? Absolutely, positively not. Coughlin is potty-mouthed micromanager with the people skills of a 2-year-old. He’s a former Parcells assistant who seemingly took all of Parcells’ annoying traits and none of the good ones. The players-only meeting was simply one more indication Coughlin has lost the team. They know he can’t inspire them, so they’ve turned to each other.

Taylor ends his column: “Dallas will end the Giants’ misery Sunday.”
