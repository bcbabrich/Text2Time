LAZAR--Eliot. We at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and beloved colleague Dr. Eliot Lazar. Words cannot fully express our sense of loss and our profound sorrow. Eliot began his brilliant career with us in 2000 as Vice President for Medical Affairs, and at the time of his passing was Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for Quality. His formidable skills shaped our quality and patient safety initiatives and allowed NewYork-Presbyterian to be recognized as a national leader in quality. He leaves a legacy that ensures each patient receives the highest-quality, most compassionate care in the safest environment. An extraordinary leader, clinician, educator, administrator, husband and father, he set an example of integrity, humility, and commitment to excellence. We will always remember him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Becky, his children, and his entire family. Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Chairman of the Board Steven J. Corwin, MD, CEO Robert E. Kelly, MD, President NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
