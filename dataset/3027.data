Soon after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the United States and Qatar quietly signed a defense cooperation agreement that provided Washington with what one official called a ''big green light'' to set up operations here. In recent years, Qatar has emerged as vital real estate for United States military strategy in the Persian Gulf.

One crucial base is As Sayliyah, a 262-acre installation completed in August 2000 at a cost of more than $100 million. The base has more than 20 climate-controlled warehouses, storing hundreds of M1 tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and other armored vehicles. It is capable of housing enough armored equipment for a heavy Army brigade. It includes a community center and living quarters for the approximately 300 American troops who have been permanently based there.

Qatar's willingness to allow the United States to build and operate the base is a breakthrough for the Pentagon, and it represents a level of cooperation that far outstrips what the Saudis have been prepared to offer. After the gulf war, when Vice President Dick Cheney was the defense secretary, he went to Saudi Arabia to discuss storing a division's worth of Army equipment there, but the Saudis turned him down.

Armored vehicles and other weapons from As Sayliyah have been quietly shipped to Kuwait, a transfer that the Pentagon initially cast as an exercise but that is seen as a preparation for war. Soldiers from the Third Infantry Division, which is expected to play a key role if there is an invasion of Iraq, rumble around Kuwait on well-maintained, modern armored vehicles that still bear the shipping labels from the Qatar installation.

After the United States began shipping armored equipment out of As Sayliyah, the military started to install communications equipment there for the command center that General Franks and his staff will use to conduct the exercise. Western officials say the Qataris have long suggested that Central Command establish a headquarters here, and the exercise may be the first step.

It is what the military calls a command post exercise, meaning that the top American commanders will carry out a war game that will simulate a campaign against an enemy in the region, but will not involve the deployment of troops. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf conducted such an exercise in July 1990 in Tampa, Fla., that used the scenario of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia.

American commanders have not disclosed the classified scenario that they plan to use for the war game. But it is clear that the exercise will enable the military to test the command and control procedures it would use if there is a war with Iraq.
