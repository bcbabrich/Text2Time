The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has warned the operators of 34 nuclear reactors around the country that the instruments they use to measure the level of water in the reactors could give a false reading during routine shutdowns and fail to detect important leaks.

The warning was issued Friday. The problem was first brought to light by an engineer at Northeast Utilities in Connecticut, who said later that he had been harassed for raising safety questions. Earlier this month, the commission agreed with him and said it would fine the utility; Northeast is appealing the ruling.

The instrument in question is used in boiling-water reactors designed by the General Electric Company. When pressure drops in the reactor vessel containing the water, the pipes used in the water-level measurement system are prone to being blocked by gas bubbles. That can make the system fail to detect a fall in the level of water, which must cover the nuclear fuel to avoid melting.

The commission had warned the operators last year that the instrument might mislead them during an accident and that such false information could turn a small mishap into a far more damaging incident. It said Friday that during a routine shutdown in January at the Washington Public Power Supply System No. 2 plant near Richland, Wash., the instrument had failed to detect a water-level drop.
