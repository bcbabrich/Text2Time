This week it was a stolen Toyota Cressida. Last week it was a stolen Nissan Maxima. Each became a weapon in the increasingly violent clash between police officers and a tough new breed of young car thief.

In a rivalry that has become more costly and more dangerous in the last few years, the police here and in surrounding communities in Essex and Union Counties find themselves outmaneuvered by swarms of brazen combatants, some of whom deliberately ram police cruisers with stolen cars, either to provoke a chase or to disable a potential pursuer.

Every town in the area acknowledges an increase in serious damage to its fleet of police cars, but Newark's problem is perhaps the worst, with nearly 20 percent of its cars damaged beyond repair after encounters with car thieves. Out of 87 cars cruising the city last year, 21 were involved in accidents, directly or indirectly caused by car thieves, and 16 were destroyed.

"They especially try to ram you from the front and activate your airbag," said Bernard DeLucia, the police chief in Irvington, a city of 61,000 next to Newark. The goal is to incapacitate a police cruiser just long enough to make a getaway.
