MOTU TAUTAU, FRENCH POLYNESIA, AUG. 19, 2005 Francesco Sogaro, 37, manager of a private equity fund in Milan, with his wife, Grazia. "Here we were in Le Taha'a, a private island resort not far from Bora Bora. It's a place where you have nothing to do except to relax yourself and take sun and not think at all about your work, about your problems. To read a good book, to be with your wife. The ideal way to leave is if you succeed in switching off your mind for the two or three weeks in which you are there. If you succeed, the benefits can last a long time. I can tell you, for two or three months minimum you are dreaming about the place." As told to Seth Kugel
