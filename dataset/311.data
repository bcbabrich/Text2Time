Openings and Events

Get set for spring — or at least springlike temperatures — with two made-to-measure suiting events. Bergdorf Goodman will waive all fees starting Thursday, so you can customize a cashmere Kiton jacket ($7,595) — choose from shawl, peak or notch collar, say, and add monogramming — for its off-the-rack price. At Goodman’s Men’s Store, 754 Fifth Avenue.

And Freemans Sporting Club is offering a 20 percent discount on all made-to-measure suits (starting at $1,084, originally $1,355) and sportcoats (starting at $800, originally $1,000). At 8 Rivington Street.

Pick your queue at either the Adidas Originals or Alexander Wang stores, where the second delivery of Mr. Wang’s capsule collection featuring a crop top ($150) and track pants ($220) with an inverted trefoil lands Saturday. At 115 Spring Street and 103 Grand Street.
