Just before midnight yesterday, housing police officers in the Melrose section of the Bronx fastened a plastic plate high on the wall behind the station desk bearing the shield of the New York City Police Department. For the officers there, the act symbolized a merger that would forever change the structure of law enforcement in New York City.

The consolidation of New York City's three police departments, something sought unsuccessfully by two Mayors and for years the focus of intense debate, became final yesterday with the incorporation of the housing police into the New York City Police Department. The merger followed by about a month the incorporation of the transit police into the larger city force.

In some neighborhoods, housing officers wore black bands on their shields. "We're mourning the death of housing," one said. But while city officials said the merger would actually increase the police presence in the projects, it would have little immediate impact, except for new patches on the officers' uniforms, and some bureaucratic changes, like different overtime forms.

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani commemorated the merger by visiting officers in what was until yesterday a housing police service area in the Bronx, the equivalent of a police precinct. He sought to assure them that they would be valued members of a larger police force that would now number more than 38,000 people.
