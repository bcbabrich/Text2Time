Maybe it's a first, but no matter. An 87-page book of photographs called "The Seasons Observed" (Harry N. Abrams, $24.95) is to go on sale at cosmetics counters later this month, as well as in bookstores. An exhibition of the photographs will open on Sept. 14 at the Holly Solomon Gallery in SoHo. The gallery will also sell the pictures.

The photographs are the work of EVELYN H. LAUDER, so there's no need to explain the cosmetics connection, or the whys and wherefores. Mrs. Lauder, the senior corporate vice president of Estee Lauder, is donating her royalties to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and many department stores are following suit with from half to all of their profits.

An originator of the pink-ribbon campaign to increase awareness of breast cancer, Mrs. Lauder has already raised $18 million for a breast cancer center for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and for research into the disease.

Not so incidentally, Mrs. Lauder said, the family company will soon introduce a new cosmetics color -- you guessed it -- "Pink Ribbon." ENID NEMY
