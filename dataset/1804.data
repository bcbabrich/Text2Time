Ron Paul supporters, already infamous for their avid online presence, are absolutely enraged that their candidate is being left out of the Fox News G.O.P. candidate debate on Sunday, and there’s a chance Mr. Paul could be left out of Saturday’s ABC forum, too.

Scores of reputable blogs have linked to an Associated Press story that tries to explain Fox’s reasoning, but that article is only infuriating Paulites and further encouraging them to mobilize their forces to reserve Mr. Paul a seat at the debate.

The roster of participants for ABC’s back-to-back, prime-time Republican and Democratic debates Saturday in New Hampshire will be determined after results of Thursday’s Iowa caucus become clear. Fox, meanwhile, has invited five G.O.P. candidates to a forum with Chris Wallace scheduled for its mobile studio in New Hampshire on Sunday. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee received invites, leaving Paul of Texas and Representative Duncan Hunter of California on the sidelines. The network said it had limited space in its studio — a souped-up bus — and that it invited candidates who had received double-digit support in recent polls. In a nationwide poll conducted Dec. 14-20 by The Associated Press and Yahoo, Thompson had the support of 11 percent of G.O.P. voters and Paul was at 3 percent. Paul’s support is at 6 percent in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted in early December.

Some bloggers assuredly will be pleased to see fewer candidates at the debates, but they’d be happier if the process of determining which were eliminated was fairer. Ed Morrissey at Captain’s Quarters writes that invitee Fred Thompson himself might not qualify for the debate, depending on which polls you study.

Most of us have made no secret of our wish to see the number of candidates narrowed for these debates, and for good reason. The current roster of seven or eight on a stage makes for nothing but the exchange of substance-less soundbites, and provide no insight into the true character and nature of the candidates. Given the game-show, gotcha quality of these gladiatorial events, one has to question why any of the contenders would want to participate. However, since we’ve muddled through this long, it makes little sense to start excluding candidates just before the first meaningful vote gets taken. Raising $19 million in a quarter shows at least some level of significant support, even if limited to the fringes of the GOP and Libertarian parties. Also, if Fox wants to rely on polling, Paul does at least as well as Thompson in Iowa and perhaps better at the moment in New Hampshire. Why not just wait for the results from Iowa to make that determination for both parties, as ABC plans to do? I’d much prefer a smaller field for the debate, but at this point, an exclusion gives nothing more than another excuse for conspiracy-mongering among Paul’s supporters. It’s hard to imagine a better one, given the fund-raising success Paul has had in the last few weeks. If Fox and the rest of the broadcasters give it a few more days, they’ll likely have all the data they need to whittle the debates down to three candidates each.

Allah Pundit at Hot Air argues that Mr. Paul’s $19.5 million fund-raising haul uniquely qualifies him for the debate.

I get the logic: Thompson’s outpolling Paul nationally by 10 points, but (a) this is, ostensibly, keyed to the New Hampshire primary, which Fred gave up on long ago and where Paul actually leads him in most polls, and (b) if Fred flames out in Iowa he may be out of the race by Sunday, in which case they’ll end up giving his seat to Paul anyway.

Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo also disagrees with Fox’s decision, calling it biased. “Paul’s out because he’s not a Fox News Bush-clone,” he said under a post with the headline “Yep, it’s an outrage.” “Say whatever you want about the guy, Fox News shouldn’t be able to silence him because they don’t like his views.”

As we get deeper into the campaign, I do not have a problem with excluding candidates who are not generating any substantial public support. Gravel, I think, was an example of that in the Democratic debates. But I think the Paulbots have a pretty good case for outrage with Ron Paul’s exclusion from the upcoming Republican debate in New Hampshire. Paul’s supporters lay most of their claim to a place in the debate on his mammoth fundraising numbers. To me, the bigger issue is that Paul is consistently outpolling Fred Thompson, who is being allowed into the debate.

Finally, James Joyner over at Outside the Beltway says:

While I don’t think he can win, it’s hard to justify keeping him out of the debates at this early stage of the campaign. At some point, though, the networks are justified in narrowing the field to only the most viable candidates. Whatever value protest candidates might have in bringing light to fringe issues and viewpoints, the point of these “debates” is to help voters chose among the available choices.

On the Democratic side, the Politico’s Ben Smith has taken a closer look at the wording of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s assessment of the political situation in Pakistan after the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. (Read the transcripts from her recent appearances on CNN’s “The Situation Room” and ABC’s “This Week.”)

The story’s spurred a lot of comments on Tuesday as it appeared that Mrs. Clinton stated that Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was up for reelection this month – inaccurate because the upcoming elections are for the Pakistani parliament, not president.

Mr. Smith writes:

“He will NOT be on the ballot,” said a Pakistan scholar at Columbia University, Philip Oldenburg, in an e-mail. “These are parliamentary elections, where the contests are for a seat in the national assembly. The prime ministerial candidate typically fights for victory in a local constituency, as well as lead[ing] the party in a national campaign.” A spokesman for Clinton, Howard Wolfson, said Clinton was referring to Musharraf’s party, not the president himself. And Oldenburg said that “how well the PML-Q, the so-called ‘King’s Party,’ does would in effect be a referendum on Musharraf.”

But Clinton’s words appear unambiguously to describe Musharraf himself as a candidate. “If President Musharraf wishes to stand for election, then he should abide by the same rules that every other candidate will have to follow,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Dec. 28. “He could be the only person on the ballot. I don’t think that’s a real election,” she told ABC’s George Stephanopolous December 30.

Bryan, a writer at the blog Hot Air, says that Mrs. Clinton “gets nearly everything about the Pakistani political situation and upcoming elections wrong. And by wrong, I am not saying that she’s a little wrong. She’s totally wrong. She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.”

What may be even more telling than how wrong Hillary got Pakistan is the fact that none of her Democrat rivals have called her out on it. She made her remarks in a high profile interview on the last Sunday morning before the Iowa caucus. It’s now Tuesday. Where are the Edwards and Obama camps to criticize her for getting everything on a vital story completely wrong? It’s reasonable to assume that none of the experts in either camp are even aware that Hillary is so disastrously wrong about the hottest foreign policy story of the moment.

He also has the video of Mrs. Clinton’s Dec. 30 appearance on “This Week.”

Kim Priestap at Wizbang wondered why the media didn’t pick up the story until now, and if it’ll gain any stream – although she thinks it should.

Senator Clinton is looking quite foolish after setting up her foreign policy experience like this because she has set an expectation that she didn’t fulfill. Not knowing that Pervez Musharraf is the president of Pakistan who won reelection in October and that the elections on January 8th, which will probably be postponed after Bhutto’s assassination, are for Parliament is really unacceptable, especially since Pakistan is such an important hot spot in the War on Terror.

As The Caucus tuned into CNN’s day-long campaign coverage today (billed as the Ballot Bowl ’08, naturally), we saw live coverage of Democratic contender Joe Biden jumping into the fray. Touting his own experience, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told a crowd in Indianola, Iowa, of Musharraf – “he’s already elected” – and “ladies and gentlemen, this is about electing the parliament.”
