Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students examine the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly as an historic step in the peace process in Northern Ireland. Students work in four small groups, each exploring the history and objectives of one of the parties represented in the new assembly, and then investigate the backgrounds and views of cabinet members from their parties. Students present cabinet member information in the form of press statements to be shared at a ‘press conference.’

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Understand basic information about the history of Northern Ireland, the new Northern Ireland Assembly, and the relationships among the parties represented in it.

2. Explore, in small groups, the history, objectives, and individual cabinet member views of the four parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly; present information from the perspectives of party members.

3. Examine the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly as an historic step in the peace process in Northern Ireland by reading and discussing “Both Sides Join to Pick New Cabinet For Ulster.”

4. Investigate, in smaller groups, the backgrounds and views of cabinet members from their parties and write press statements sharing this information to be presented at a “press conference” in a later class.

Resources / Materials:

-paper

-pens/pencils

-teacher-created flags of the four parties involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly (can be obtained from their Web sites; URLs given in the lesson plan), one flag per party drawn on a large piece of paper titled with the party’s name

-computers with Internet access (minimum of four)

-copies of “Both Sides Join to Pick New Cabinet For Ulster” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to students’ arrival in class, arrange desks in four groups in different corners of the room, and post the flag of a party represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly over each group. Upon entering class, divide students equally into these groups and explain that they are going to be exploring the objectives of their party. Give students some basic background about the history of Northern Ireland and these parties’ relationships with one another. Then, ask students to brainstorm what they think they need to know about their party, and jot ideas on the board.

2. Each group researches their assigned party using Internet resources, answering the following questions and any others from the initial brainstorm that the class feels are important in understanding their parties (written on the board for easier student reference):

–When was this party created?

–What are this party’s objectives?

–Who are the cabinet members in the Northern Ireland Assembly from this party, and what are the key positions of each on the other parties, the future of Northern Ireland, and other critical topics?

Provide the official Web site addresses of these parties to each group as a starting point for research:

Ulster Unionists (//www.uup.org/)

Democratic Unionists (//www.dup.org.uk/)

Social Democratic and Labor Party (//www.sdlp.ie/)

Sinn Fein (//www.sinnfein.ie/)

3. Each group briefly presents the information found through their research from the perspectives of members of their party (in other words, in the first person.)

4. Now equipped with a better understanding of the Northern Ireland peace process and the parties involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly, read and discuss “Both Sides Join to Pick New Cabinet For Ulster,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What is the historic significance of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the newly selected cabinet members?

b. Why would the inclusion of Sinn Fein members in the cabinet be controversial?

c. What is the importance of representing both Protestant and Catholic parties in this assembly?

d. What tensions already exist between some of the members of the cabinet? Discuss your response.

e. What views of a united Ireland are expressed by cabinet members quoted in the article? Why would this assembly want to include people who aim to fight against a united Ireland? (Ask groups to briefly re-present the views of their cabinet members mentioned in the article.)

f. What previous attempts at creating this assembly have been thwarted, and how were they mended?

g. What occurrences happened at this meeting, and how do they reflect the current political climate of Northern Ireland?

h. What is the IRA, and what about it was discussed by the assembly?

i. What is the historic significance of “the British parliament (passing) home rule authority from London to Belfast”?

j. After researching the parties and reading this article, speculate on the future of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Divide students’ groups into as many pairs or smaller groups as there are cabinet members in the Northern Ireland Assembly from their party (Ulster Unionists- 4, Democratic Unionists- 2, Social Democratic and Labor Party- 4, Sinn Fein- 2). Each of these smaller groups then selects a cabinet member from their party as the focus of some deeper research on his or her background and views. Each group then writes a press statement sharing this information to be presented at a “press conference” in a later class. At the press conference, members of the press (the classmates in the audience) should jot down questions about this person’s statement on index cards and submit them for answers either immediately or in a later “Northern Ireland Assembly conference” (round-table discussion).

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Along what lines is Northern Ireland divided? How do these compare to divisions that exist between people and political parties in your country?

–What efforts for peace in Northern Ireland have been made in the past, and how have they been effective or ineffective?

–What are the goals of the Northern Ireland Assembly? What additional goals do you think they should have, and why?

–What do you think the cabinet members in the Northern Ireland Assembly should try to do with regard to unifying the country? Why do some of the cabinet members not want this as the final result of the assembly?

–What other examples, historic and current, exist with regard to countries being divided on the basis of religious differences? What actions have people on the different sides often taken in these situations? What resolution do you think there could be to bring together people of different religions?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions, group research and presentation of a party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and a research-based press statement from the perspective of one of the assembly’s cabinet members about his or her background and views.

Vocabulary:

parliament, negotiators, deadlock, guerrilla, disarmament, ministers, hallmark, enormity, converting, cohabiting, deputy, thwart, republicans, nationalists, collective, adjournment, stalemate, rescind, combative, presiding, reconvene, paramilitary

Extension Activities:

1. Organize a meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly (members played by students), in which key issues in Ireland today are discussed and debated from the perspectives of the cabinet members researched in class. Try to host one of these meetings prior to an actual meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and compare your meeting’s results to the real results.

2. Follow news coverage of the Northern Ireland Assembly cabinet member researched for homework. How does this member contribute to the Northern Ireland Assembly? How does the public view him or her? What stances does he or she take with regard to political, social and economic matters in Northern Ireland?

3. Compare New York Times coverage of this historic development in the Irish peace process to its coverage in Irish newspapers. Visit Ecola Newsstand (//www.ecola.com) to access English-language newspapers and magazines from Ireland and around the world, and explore how the Web sites of the four political parties involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly present current events related to the cabinet’s decisions.

4. Design a flag that might appropriately represent the Northern Ireland Assembly and the attempt to unify the four historically divided parties involved.

5. Explore grassroots efforts at peace in Northern Ireland, including the works of Nobel Peace Prize winners John Hume and David Trimble (1998) and Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan (1976).

6. Learn about how the Northern Ireland Assembly will work. How the Assembly Will Work (//news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_307000/307585.stm) is a sketch from the BBC of how a Northern Ireland Assembly could work. Compare this sketch to what actually evolves as the way in which this new body functions.

7. Create a timeline of the history of the Irish Republican Army, including its impending disarmament in May 2000.

8. Analyze the Good Friday Agreement and its role in the Irish peace process.

9. Working in groups, research major events and cultural changes in Irish history: The Early Period (circa 400- circa 1100), The Anglo-Norman Period (circa 1100- circa 1400), The Period of English Supremacy (circa 1400- circa 1650), The Revolutionary Period (circa 1650- circa 1800), and Modern Ireland (circa 1800-today).

10. Research other historic and current situations in which countries are divided along religious lines. What are the issues on both sides of the situation? What actions have people on the different sides taken against their “enemies”? What past attempts at unifying this country have occurred, and in what ways have they been successful or unsuccessful? What resolution do you think there could be to bring together people of different religions in this country?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research the influx of Irish immigrants to the United States beginning in the 19th century. What brought Irish immigrants to the United States? What challenges did they face in their new land?

Fine Arts- Create a gallery of Irish art (visual art, dance, music and writing) in your classroom or school. For each “item” in your gallery, include a brief description on an index card indicating the name and creator of the piece of art, the time period in which it was created, and the significance of this piece of art to understanding Irish culture, political climate or national identity. Invite other classes to tour your gallery.

Geography- Create an illustrated guidebook of symbols common to Irish folklore, such as leprechauns, shamrocks and Gaelic knots, as well as the origins of Irish holidays. You may also want to include Irish folklore and traditions in your book.

Language Arts- Read works by Irish authors and poets, and examine how their works reflect political struggles and a sense of national identity in Ireland.

Media Studies- Examine how Irish characters are presented in movies and on television. How do actors depicting Irish people act, look, and interact? Would you consider any of these presentations of characters to be stereotypes, and why?
