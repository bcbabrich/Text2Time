A lawyer for the city said that although the city had agreed to send out the directives, the city maintains that no new policy of selective-enforcement has ever been instituted, and that the increase in arrests merely reflects a sharp increase in the number of contacts between officers and homeless people.

''There were more arrests because there was more activity,'' the lawyer, Gail Donoghue, special assistant to the corporation counsel, said. She described the directives as ''a confirmation of our existing policy and practice.''

''The policy was and is, as part of Police Department training and procedures, that people are treated the same,'' Ms. Donoghue said. ''But we didn't have these things written out.''

''It is our policy,'' she added. ''We have no reason not to write it down.''

A police spokesman had no additional comment.

The lawsuit charged that after reports in the news media last fall about a significant increase in the number of homeless people on the streets, top police officials directed the Homeless Outreach Unit to change its mission, from one of offering services to arrest. The suit said that officers had also been told that they were not to enforce the law in a similar manner against people who were not homeless.

The new directives have been read aloud at 10 consecutive roll calls of the Homeless Outreach Unit and the Transit Bureau, and distributed to individual officers, the documents show.

They also offer guidance to members of the Homeless Outreach Unit when carrying out their duties. For example, if an officer finds a person stretched out on a subway seat or a park bench, the officer must first ''take appropriate corrective action.''
