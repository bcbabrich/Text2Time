Gerry Adams and John Hume, the two most influential Roman Catholic political leaders in Northern Ireland, said today that they had met with Irish Republican Army officials on Wednesday and had come away with the impression that the group would restore the cease-fire it ended on Feb. 9.

Mr. Adams, the president of the I.R.A.'s political wing, Sein Fein, and Mr. Hume, the head of the mainstream Social Democratic and Labor Party, said they did not press for a firm commitment and got no such guarantee. But Mr. Hume said they had made it clear that they wanted "the restoration of the peace process and a cessation of violence."

On Irish television tonight, Mr. Adams said of the cease-fire: "The I.R.A. may decide in its wisdom to reinstate it. I would be inclined to think they have a willingness to enhance the peace process."

But on BBC, he said, "If you're saying to me, do I think that'll happen tonight or tomorrow night or the next night, I think it's most unlikely."
