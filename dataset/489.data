Since the Nixon administration, the federal government has stopped building subsidized housing. Once, public housing was a proud symbol of postwar American democracy. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers got good homes and a leg up. Now Washington offers tax incentives, some $7 billion a year, to private developers so they will take over the job. The public has gone from builder to beggar.

For comparison’s sake, Washington each year gives up more than $100 billion nationally in mortgage interest deductions, which principally benefit the upper-middle class.

This year’s presidential candidates — even Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton — have so far said next to nothing about affordable housing. Amazingly, neither of those Democrats had evidently visited a public-housing project before the New York primary in April. The Democrats have since strengthened the party’s platform; but the issue didn’t seriously come up at either convention, so it is hard to believe much help is forthcoming.

City Hall knows this and plans to steer billions of capital dollars toward housing, allocating more money to subsidize affordable homes than the next 50 United States cities combined. Even so, absent greater federal money, it will remain nearly impossible to reach the levels of affordability that low-income New Yorkers actually need.

Of course, housing isn’t the only issue that matters to city residents. Zoning should grow out of holistic planning based on participatory governance. Communities have been complaining loudly that the de Blasio administration is a stalking horse for large developers, hellbent on securing as much housing development as it can wrangle out of rezoning negotiations with neighborhoods, conceding only what’s necessary — not collaborating with locals from the start.

In East New York, the first neighborhood the mayor rezoned, the city has paved the way for subsidized apartments and neighborhood improvements. But speculators have also bought property, driven up land prices and threatened some of the very residents the rezoning is intended to protect, fueling fears among poor New Yorkers that Mr. de Blasio’s plan will make neighborhoods even less affordable. In some cases, the relatively high price of affordable apartments may actually drive up housing costs.
