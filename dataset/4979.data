Bridge and other intellectual games are excluded from the Olympics, but the organizers of the Goodwill Games in Seattle have proved more flexible. Twenty-five Soviet players are there, and will compete today and tomorrow against players from the Seattle area.

The visitors are more relaxed than they were a week ago. Their sports committee had provided them with tickets to Seattle but return tickets only from New York to Moscow. A lot of goodwill from T.W.A. and the bridge community solved most of the problem, and the Goodwill players will not have to walk across North America. Some hospitality is needed for their visit to New York City next week. For information, call Henry Bethe, president of the Greater New York Bridge Association, (212) 552-6262.

One visitor, Vasily Levenko of Tallinn, Estonia, came to the Summer Nationals in Boston last week. Playing with Val Mashkin, a Soviet emigre living in Stratford, Conn., he did well in the Red Ribbon Pairs. On the diagramed deal from an earlier event they defended a tricky three no-trump contract.

South would have had an easy task after a club or a heart lead, but West chose a spade. South won in dummy, went to the diamond queen and led a club to the jack. East won and shifted to the heart nine, covered with the ten and won with the queen. Another low spade lead was won with the king, and South was at the crossroads.
