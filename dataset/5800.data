About 150 relatives of missing people took over the Metropolitan Cathedral here today, locked themselves inside and vowed to stay until the Government accounted for the missing.

Nineth de Garcia, founder of Mutual Support, an organization for the relatives of the missing, was in the group. The men, women and children entered the Roman Catholic cathedral, asked the few other people inside to leave, then locked the large wooden doors.

A three-man committee agreed to mediate between the protesters and the Government. The members are Vinicio Cerezo, the Christian Democratic Party presidential candidate; Msgr. Oriano Quilici, the papal nuncio, and Eduardo Meyer Maldonado, university rector.
