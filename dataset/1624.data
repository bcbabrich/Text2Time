MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — There’s a vibrant throng of University of Cincinnati fans behind the west end zone of Dolphin Stadium for the Orange Bowl here. In the same spot on the opposite side of the stadium there are a lot of empty seats in the Virginia Tech section. Why? Well, because Tech fans are smart.

This is Cincinnati’s first B.C.S. game and the fans bought about 14,000 of the university’s allotment of 17,500 tickets. This isn’t Tech’s first B.C.S. rodeo, and its fans bought just 4,000 of its allotment.

That’s because Tech fans went online and realized that the Orange Bowl ticket market looked a lot like stock market in the last six months — way, way down. With tickets auctions starting at 99 cents on eBay, and hordes of tickets available in the $10 range, Tech fans happily gobbled up the cheap ducats.

The lesson here? The bowl that’s paired with the double-hosting model every year is clearly going to be a hard sell. So if your team gets shuttled off to that game, don’t buy tickets through your school.

It may mean not sitting with your fans, but it could save you a lot of cash. Just ask the Virginia Tech fans.
