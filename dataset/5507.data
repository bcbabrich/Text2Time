The new American approach would set equal limits on the number of tanks and artillery pieces. The limit would be set at current NATO levels. Some Administration officials said the United States might agree to a proposal that set limits at slightly below NATO levels, as West German officials have said to have suggested.

If a limit is set at current NATO levels, the Warsaw Pact would be required to reduce its force of tanks from about 48,000 to about 20,000. On artillery pieces, the Warsaw Pact would have to reduce the number of its weapons from about 36,000 to about 15,000.

Some Administration officials said the American approach might be expanded in light of the ongoing consultations to include an additional limit on the number of weapons in the central part of Europe. This could be done by setting a limit on non-indigenous forces stationed on the territory of European nations, such as Soviet tanks in East Germany and American tanks in West Germany. No Limits on Aircraft

No limits would be sought on tactical aircraft, an area where NATO has a technological advantage over the Warsaw Pact.

Administration officials argued that limits on aircraft are unacceptable because aircraft are ''dual capable'' systems that can carry nuclear-tipped missiles and bombs. NATO has steadfastly refused to include the tactical nuclear weapons in the the talks on conventional arms. The officials also asserted that limits on aircraft would be very hard to verify.

But the Soviet Union is expected to seek limits on aircraft and has talked publicly about the need to include tactical nuclear weapons in the new talks.

American officials said that there were some differences within the alliance over how to proceed in the talks. West German officials are said to have expressed a concern that a new agreement lead to some reductions on the Western side because West Germany has a declining birth rate and may have to reduce the size of its forces anyway.
