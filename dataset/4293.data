To shouts of "We won! We won!" tens of thousands of students marched through Paris and other French cities today to celebrate their victory over the conservative Government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in a dispute over the minimum wage for young people.

Repeating scenes that have become familiar here this month, however, after the Paris march ended in the Place Denfert-Rochereau this afternoon, a few dozen vandals began a rampage, breaking some shop and restaurant windows, setting fire to several parked cars and damaging dozens of others.

When the police intervened with tear gas to clear the plaza, the youths, many of them wearing handkerchiefs over their faces to hide their identity, responded with stones and bricks and then headed into nearby streets. Two television cameramen were also attacked and injured. Decree Is Revoked

But most of the demonstrators in Paris, Lyons, Rennes, Nantes and other cities were content to bang drums, blow horns and chant slogans to mark the Government's decision on Wednesday to revoke a decree allowing those under 25 to be paid between 30 and 80 percent of the $1,000 monthly minimum wage.
