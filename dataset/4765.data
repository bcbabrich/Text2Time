TWO years ago the prices of older exotic European cars like Ferrari, Aston Martin and Jaguar were skyrocketing, often doubling in a few months. Then early last year, the bottom dropped out of the market. Cars went unsold at auctions or were bid on only by owners trying to prop up the market.

"The Ferrari market is shattered," said Ed Jurist, owner of the Vintage Car Store in Nyack, N.Y., and a longtime trader of old, rare cars. "A 1972 Daytona that sold for $400,000 at the peak is only worth about $200,000 to $225,000 now. A 1986 512 Boxer that went for $340,000 is under $200,000 now."

Mr. Jurist said the rapid inflation in the value of some exotics had not been fueled by genuine collectors. "The market was pushed to artificial heights by speculators who were selling to each other," he said. "Then one decided he did not want to play and it all collapsed."

"People borrowed $500,000 to buy a Ferrari, expecting to sell it in a year for $1 million," said Dean Tezos, a New York collector. "The interest on that comes to $65,000 to $70,000 a year. That is not much if you are expecting to sell for $1 million, but it is not viable when the market is down."
