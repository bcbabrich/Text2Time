To the Editor:

The analysis of Supreme Court voting patterns showing that the members vote more like five independent justices rather than nine seems to be based upon the flawed idea that ideally their votes should be completely independent (''A Mathematician Crunches the Supreme Court's Numbers,'' June 24).

But since they are judging, rather than casting independent or random ballots, their votes should generally tend to be consistent.

Nine people judging a skating competition are all likely to award high marks to the best competitor and low marks to the worst competitor because each is exercising judgment as to how well a skater meets various established criteria.

Similarly, Supreme Court justices are trying to determine how well or at least whether or not a given factual situation is consistent with generally agreed-upon legal principles and methods of analysis. Therefore agreement, rather than disagreement, should be the norm, and in fact it is.
