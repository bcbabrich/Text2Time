In week nine of the trial of three former police officers accused in the beating death of a man last November, defense lawyers attacked the medical examiner's autopsy of the victim for failing to address the role that cocaine might have played in his death.

Three medical experts testified for the defense that the autopsy had been seriously flawed because although the victim, Malice Green, 35, had suffered more than a dozen blows to the head, they alone were not enough to kill him.

Defense lawyers also sought to show that testimony of witnesses to the encounter between Mr. Green and police officers last Nov. 5 differed greatly as to who did what to Mr. Green.

The week's most compelling testimony came when one defendant, Robert Lessnau, took the stand and strongly disputed witnesses who said they saw him punch and kick Mr. Green as he lay bloody and handcuffed in a Detroit street.
