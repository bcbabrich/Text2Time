AMERICAN TABLOID By James Ellroy 576 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.

"I'm saying it's so big and audacious that we'll most likely never be suspected," says a character in James Ellroy's densely malevolent new novel, "American Tabloid," as he proposes a plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. "I'm saying that even if we are, the powers that be will realize that it can never be conclusively proven. I'm saying that a consensus of denial will build off of it. I'm saying that people will want to remember the man as something he wasn't. I'm saying that we'll present them with an explanation and the powers that be will prefer it to the truth, even though they know better."

Mr. Ellroy, a skilled purveyor of brutally tough prose, assumes the same sort of gullibility on his readers' part. Tapping into an enduringly popular vein of paranoid fantasy, he extrapolates from President Kennedy's assassination to create a scheme that's as intricate as it is irresponsible. Oliver Stone's "J. F. K." looks like the Disney version beside Mr. Ellroy's web of triple-dealing operatives, hapless thugs and public figures -- including Howard Hughes, J. Edgar Hoover and Jimmy Hoffa -- whose private activities are freely imagined and embroidered here.

Mr. Ellroy's prologue offers a defiant justification of such tactics. "It's time to demythologize an era and build a new myth from the gutter to the stars," he maintains. He also notes: "Mass-market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed. Hagiography sanctifies shuck-and-jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight. Our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight. Only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight."

This becomes the shaky foundation for Mr. Ellroy's skyscraper of cards, a brazen, violent, sometimes caustically funny assemblage of assassination-linked facts and rumors. What command attention are the sheer intricacy of the author's plotting, the depth of his bottomless cynicism and the staccato energy of his prose, which neither minces nor wastes words. "Nobody talked -- Jimmy Hoffa sulking killed chitchat" is a typically crystalline observation.
