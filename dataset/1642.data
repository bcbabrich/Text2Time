The wild swings in momentum between the Steelers and Cardinals resulted in some dramatic changes in the betting markets. At Betfair, the London-based betting exchange, gamblers placed bets based on the game’s fluctuations, in real time, and those bets resulted in a market — just like a stock exchange — for a team’s chances of winning.

The Steelers entered the game as a roughly 70 percent favorite to win. Once the game started, they maintained their position as strong favorites. They seemed destined for victory, at least in the bettors’ opinion, by the beginning of the fourth quarter, when they held a 20-7 lead. The Steelers’ win probability soared as high as the mid-90s.

But bettors quickly soured on them when the Cardinals took the lead on Larry Fitzgerald’s two touchdown catches in the fourth quarter, and Arizona swung to a more than 70 percent favorite. That would not last long, though, when Santonio Holmes’s touchdown catch put the Steelers back at 75 percent. As the Cardinals’ final drive faltered, that percentage rapidly rose to the final number, 100 percent.
