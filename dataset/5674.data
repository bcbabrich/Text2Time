Stores were empty and Madison

Avenue was virtually deserted yesterday afternoon. But for last- minute Champagne buyers, it was a frenzied moment.

At Sherry-Lehmann, the Madison Avenue wine merchant, a battered number machine, just like a deli's, stood at the entrance to the crowded store.

''I'm a regular Champagne drinker, but I do take the bottle out of the mouth,'' said Richard D. De Veaux, a teacher from the Wharton School of Business Administration in Philadelphia. He bought three different bottles, one of pink Champagne. ''I'm testing them out tonight for my wedding next summer,'' he explained.

At Garnet Wine & Liquors, on Lexington Avenue at 68th Street, two dozen people queued patiently. ''I'm going to share it,'' said William R. De Sena, a Manhattan investment banker, cradling his bottle of Roederer Cristal 1979, which cost $45.95.
