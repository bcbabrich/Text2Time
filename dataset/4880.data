"We're starting to be able to pick up the defensive momentum the way we were able to under Coach Pitino," said Mark Jackson, who watched from the bench as rookie Greg Anthony used his quick feet to defend against Isiah Thomas for all but the final seconds of the fourth quarter. "The defense is different because we don't go full-court. But we're starting to be able to pick it up a notch in the half-court, and at important times in the game."

Before anyone gets carried away, it would be wise to consider who the competition was. The fading Pistons (7-9), two-time National Basketball Association champions, still bring an admirable ethic to work, but appear to have fallen a couple of crucial notches in their levels of chemistry and execution.

Even what Knicks Coach Pat Riley described as their "tactics" didn't help them yesterday. Early in the second quarter, with Ewing posting up in the lane against Bill Laimbeer, Laimbeer fell backward and to the floor, in small part from minimal contact and in large part from one of his notorious flops. Laimbeer got the call, and Ewing a techical foul, but John Salley fell over Laimbeer and injured his left knee. The 7-foot front courtman, Detroit's most active shot-blocking presence, was suspected to have suffered damage to his anterior cruciate ligament.

It also didn't help the Pistons, nor hurt the Knicks' growing defensive egos, that small forward Mark Aguirre, after piling up 18 first-half points, injured his right elbow and played only the first few minutes of the third quarter. That left Detroit's offense in the hands of Thomas, who scored 17 points, and his slumping backcourt partner, Joe Dumars, who had 15. Of Us and Them

Behind Gerald Wilkins's 8 points to close the second quarter, the Knicks reduced Detroit's lead to a workable 56-48. Then the Pistons committed a rash of early third-quarter fouls, worked their way into the penalty at the 9:19 mark and paid for it. As the Knicks took their 60-56 lead, 8 of their 12 points came at the line.
