THERE are house tours and show houses, but rarely has a historic church offered its space to a decorator's showcase.

''It's not a show house in a traditional sense,'' said John Franzen, an architect, president of the Southport Conservancy and creator of a vignette for ''Rooms With a View'' at the Southport Congregational Church. ''It's a sound bite version of a designer show house. You have to get an idea across in a small amount of space. Like any small space it's sometimes more challenging because you have to be more resourceful.''

Opening for its fourth year Friday through next Sunday, ''Rooms With a View'' will feature 12 designer vignettes, a marketplace of crafts, antiques and decorative accessories, traditional and contemporary art galleries and a series of events. A preview party takes place on Thursday from 6:30 to 9 P.M.

The event replaces an antiques show that, it was decided, had run its course after 25 years.

''The church needed a fund raiser to support its outreach programs,'' said Havilande Bayard Whitcomb, a space planner with Beinfield Wagner Architects in South Norwalk and a member of the event's design committee.
