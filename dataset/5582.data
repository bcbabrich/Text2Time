Divulge and Equalize scored similarly styled victories an hour apart in the divided Red Smith Handicap at Belmont Park yesterday, but raced over drastically different surfaces. Divulge just missed a course record while smoking along through the sunshine on a rock-hard inner turf course, then Equalize raced through the rain after a downpour had turned the footing slow and soggy.

Both winners ran second most of the way before collaring an early leader in the stretch and drawing off by comfortable margins. In the first division, Divulge caught favored Island Sun at the quarter-pole and then motored off to score by four lengths over Tri for Size, with Island Sun holding on for third. In the second division, Equalize caught Entitled To at the same spot and drew off by 1 3/4 lengths over Palace Panther with Entitled To lasting for third.

Divulge paid $9.60 after running the mile and a quarter in 1:59 under Jean Cruguet, just one-fifth off Hunza Dancer's 1977 course record. Equalize, who paid $7.40 and was ridden by Walter Guerra, needed 2:02 1/5 to complete the same distance after an hour of rain softened up the course.

The Red Smith was run as the Edgemere Handicap until 1982, when it was renamed in memory of the distinguished sports columnist who wrote for The New York Times at the time of his death. The race begins a summer series of grass racing at Belmont Park that continues with the one and three-eighths-mile Bowling Green Handicap June 15 and the one and one-half-mile Sword Dancer July 26.
