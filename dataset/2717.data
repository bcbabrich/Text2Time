South Korea's new president, Roh Moo Hyun, has named an economic team to confront the challenge of staving off an economic downturn.

Kim Jin Pyo, a finance ministry official for nearly 30 years, was named head of the economic team as deputy prime minister and finance minister.

Mr. Kim, 55, had served as vice chairman of the transition team, which was often roiled by quarrels between moderates and leftists who saw Mr. Roh's presidency as a chance for sweeping change in an economy dominated by family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol.

''He's kind of an old-generation minister,'' said Kwon Jae Jung, a research fellow at the Korea Institute of Finance. ''He is a quite reasonable person. He will control the speed of reform.''
