Premium cigars are not the only ones with rising demand, said Mr. Jean, whose firm helped take 800-JR Cigar public last June. Sales of mass-market cigars, which cost less than $1 each, are also growing, he said, and industry analysts say the same is true for middle-market smokes ($1 to $3).

With such strong demand, Mr. Jean and many of his peers are convinced that cigar smoking won't just be a fad like Pet Rocks or bell-bottom pants. Also, he said, there is the fast growth of the prime market for cigar smoking -- men in their 40's and 50's. This age group will increase by 3.7 million people in the next three years alone.

Mr. Lurito also points to the past as proof that cigar smoke will not dissipate fast. ''Every time there's been an uptick in cigars over the past 30 to 40 years, it's tended to last 7 to 10 years,'' he said. ''I've looked at the numbers and they look credible.''

Also, the recent price declines in cigar stocks may have made them bargains.

The four largest companies are trading at 9.5 to 13.8 times their estimated 1998 earnings per share. Yet, with demand surging, the earnings of all these enterprises are expected to grow at an attractive 25 to 30 percent a year for the next three to five years. These are mouth-watering disparities: A stock is often considered attractive if its price-earnings ratio is moderately less than expected earnings growth.

Which cigar stocks look best?

For investors interested in the flagship part of the market -- premium smokes -- General Cigar is a logical bet. It gets about 60 percent of its revenues from its Macanudos, Partagas and other premium cigars, which are presumably less vulnerable to price competition than middle- and mass-market varieties. And its brands are strong: Macanudos, for instance, is the country's biggest premium seller.

The fortunes of Swisher International are more price-sensitive -- only 10 percent of its revenues come from premium cigars -- but the company offers diversity. It sells cigars in all price ranges, as well as ''little'' cigars and smokeless tobacco. Combined with strong brand names, like King Edward and Optimo, its product range can mean a more balanced revenue stream -- a plus in an industry where the future is hazy.

Mr. Lurito's fund has been buying more shares of Consolidated Cigar, the industry's largest company with $299 million in 1997 sales. Consolidated has a strong presence in the premium market, which supplies 45 percent of its revenues, and it owns famous brands like Don Diego, Dutch Masters and El Producto.
