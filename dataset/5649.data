Hopes exist that junk bond prices could quickly improve if the Union Carbide Corporation were to proceed with its plans to repurchase $2.5 billion of outstanding bonds. Anticipation of that refinancing caused junk bond prices to rise early in November, but a delay was caused by a legal challenge from the Indian Government, which is pressing claims related to the 1984 gas leak that killed more than 2,000 people near Carbide's Bhopal, India, plant. Yesterday, the way was cleared in India for Carbide to proceed.

''I'm not sure all the disruption is past, but I am sure the high-yield market is here to stay,'' said Brian Wruble, chief executive officer at Equitable Capital Management. From the corporate treasurers' point of view, he noted that junk bonds offer a known long-term interest rate rather than the floating rate on a shorter term bank loan.

For investors, Mr. Wruble noted that yields, which are five percentage points greater than on Treasury issues, offer a comfortable cushion of interest payments, even after setting aside two percentage points in a reserve fund. ''After a few years without defaults, you have earned enough that you can tolerate some sizable defaults and still be as well off as if you were in Treasuries,'' he said. Favored by Dealers

Junk bonds are also a favorite of securities dealers who earn underwriting spreads that are up to five times larger than for high-quality bonds.

Data from IDD Information Services show that junk bond financings have raised $29.4 billion so far this year, with Drexel Burnham serving as lead underwriter for $13.3 billion of that amount. In 1985, the previous record year for junk bond financings, there were $14.8 billion of new issues, with $8.3 billion through Drexel. As recently as 1980, only $1.4 billion of junk bonds were sold, with Drexel accounting for $415 million.

Besides waiting for the next wave of junk bond financings, investors and corporate finance officers have also been wondering whether Drexel's capacity to arrange new financings would somehow be curbed. A proposed $200 million financing for Kiewit Continental has not come to market as expected, but Drexel officials said the issue was ''on hold since September, for reasons completely unrelated to market conditions.''

''I think the next few weeks will be the real test for Drexel and the junk bond market,'' said David Breazzano, executive vice president at the High Yield Bond Fund of T. Rowe Price Associates.

For corporate treasurers and investment bankers, the challenge to the junk bond market came at an inauspicious time. The supply of prospective new issues is unusually heavy, and some corporations were relying on the high-yield bonds to help finance various moves before changes in the tax laws take effect at the first of the year.
