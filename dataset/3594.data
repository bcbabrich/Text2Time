Even as the winning streak was growing to seven games and the city was beginning to notice St. John's again, Fran Fraschilla remembered the fable, as told by a sage named Carnesecca, of the peacock and the feather duster. In simpler days, today's preener was warned that it could become tomorrow's cleaning utensil. But that was before this impossible-to-figure Big East basketball season, and a St. John's team hat finds itself somewhere in between.

When Notre Dame's late burst sent the Fighting Irish to a 73-65 victory at Madison Square Garden yesterday, the Red Storm learned that it was no longer as attractive as a team with seven consecutive victories, but nowhere as limited as the team that faced a crisis in late December. St. John's frustration came from the way it lost, especially when there was so much to be gained.

''Was this a lost opportunity?'' Ron Artest, the freshman forward, was asked.

He looked down and nodded. The Red Storm was playing before a noisy crowd of 12,390, its largest at home this season. A victory would have created the potential for a first national ranking in five years. It could have given the Red Storm the school's longest conference winning streak since the 1985 Final Four team won 14 straight, and should have carried St. John's one step closer to a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament bid.

After a few decisive moments, those possibilities were delayed, or gone. The Irish (11-7, 5-5) have won 4 of their last 6 games. Artest listened to someone say that even when St. John's was ahead, the Red Storm did not appear secure. Artest took the opposite view. ''We shouldn't be feeling secure,'' he said. ''That's what happened -- we got secure. That was the turning point.''
