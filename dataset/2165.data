WILD birds have completed their seasonal migration, and it appears that the United States has dodged the avian flu threat for now. The pattern of the semiannual migration itself provides some protection.

On the three main flyways of the Western Hemisphere, migratory birds travel roughly north-south, with only relatively small areas in the Arctic and far northern regions where birds fly east-west, to and from Asia and Europe. In the Eastern Hemisphere, however, where five main flyways interconnect, the virus can spread much more easily. The route over East Asia, where the deadly H5N1 virus has killed millions of birds and at least 74 humans, overlaps with the Central Asian flyway, which overlaps with those to Africa and Europe.

These long migrations increase the possibility that the flu viruses the birds carry will infect domestic fowl. This raises the odds that the virus will one day evolve or mutate to spread from human to human.

The United States, Canada and Europe try to keep track of migratory waterfowl. If wild or domesticated birds are discovered to be infected with H5N1, they and those nearby can be destroyed, and uninfected birds vaccinated.

But surveillance is not universal. In Asia, people who raise chickens for food are hesitant to report sick birds, unless they know they will be compensated. In addition, some nations were initially reluctant to declare that a flu problem existed at all.
