When Honduras defeated the United States, 2-1, today to win the regional Olympic qualifying tournament in soccer, ecstatic fans held blue-and-white Honduran flags in two hands and waved them as a matador waves a cape. They serenaded the team with loud horns at Hersheypark Stadium, while the players carried Coach Ramon Enrique Maradiaga on their shoulders for a victory lap.

Ten days earlier, when players temporarily boycotted the tournament over nonpayment of bonuses, there had been a different reaction toward the team in Honduras.

''They wanted to stone us,'' Maradiaga said.

Today's match, played before 12,129 fans, was not particularly meaningful in terms of the Olympics, as both teams had qualified Friday for the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia.

Yet the conclusion represented a stunningly improbable resurrection for a Honduran team that arrived as a national shame the day the tournament began, lost, 3-0, to the United States and then recovered to win the North American, Central American and Caribbean regional tournament, defeating the heavily favored Americans and Mexicans in three days.
