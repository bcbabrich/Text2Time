40 Across: Period described by the clues and answers to 1- and 72-Across (which are the start and end of a word ladder formed by the answers to the 10 asterisked clues)

TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — We have another very long clue today. You could figure out the puzzle without it but it’s reproduced above in case you need it.

Many solvers are fond of word ladders. Often, when you get the first answer, you can climb quickly up and down the rest of the starred clues filling in the rest, but the point is not to be difficult. This is only Tuesday, after all. These ladders often go from an extreme to its opposite and today’s manages the feat in a particularly elegant and timely way.

LUCA Brasi at 57 Across was the character in the opening reel who told the Godfather, “I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child.” By the end of the film, he’s sleeping with the fishes. James CAAN at 59 Down played Sonny in the same film.

I love seeing the matching “Gift of the Magi” clues. I learned from that story never to give anyone a comb for Christmas. “Going places” is a joke that has probably been overused by now. The “Greek gathering spot” or STOA and the “Looped handle, in archaeology” or ANSA are words you just have to learn. You’ll see them again.

There were several outstanding clues today. “Mint green” is the U.S. DOLLAR. “Grace period” is the button at the end of the prayer. Best of all, “Gala night duds” has nothing to do with failure.

A few months ago, Patrick Merrell began the popular feature “Ask Will,” where Will Shortz answered two questions a week from readers. In order to preserve what turned out to be an in-depth conversation between editor and solvers, an Ask Will Archive Page is now available. It’s worth reading all the way through.

And finally, a few readers have asked if I intend to continue the Jim Horne Book Club. We’ll see how it goes but I will mention that I just finished reading “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” (review) about the HeLa cell line that’s still used for research, and the fascinating story behind it. Highly recommended. HELA would make a great crossword entry some day.
