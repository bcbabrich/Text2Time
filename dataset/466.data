​Waiting for High Tide

Written and illustrated by Nikki McClure

It’s six hours from low tide to high tide, and the narrator of the latest paper-cut marvel from McClure (“Mama, Is It Summer Yet?”) is impatient. Her family is building a raft. She roams the beach collecting cool stuff and checking out barnacles. The raft gets done, but there’s more waiting before they can push off. Finally, they float away and jump in the water “again and again and again.” Heaven! There’s also info on checking the tides in Washington State, and a funny bit about safely using a hatchet.
