In the acrimonious conclusion of a trial that exposed underlying racial tensions between two Brooklyn neighborhoods, three Carroll Gardens teen-agers were sentenced yesterday to the maximum prison term of three and a half to seven years for the September assault of a 27-year-old black man from Red Hook.

Dozens of relatives and friends of the three youths, who are white, cursed prosecutors, punched doors and wept after the sentence was announced. More than a dozen court officers were on hand to control the crowd, and several of the defendants' supporters said the youths were being unfairly labeled as racists.

Before announcing the sentences, Justice Alan D. Marrus of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn lectured the three defendants -- Anthony Mascuzzio, 18, Alfonse Russo, 18, and his cousin Andrew Russo, 19 -- about taking the law into their own hands. And Kevin Teague, a United Parcel Service employee who was the victim of the attack, asked the judge to give the defendants the maximum.

Prosecutors said Mr. Teague was attacked by the three youths on Sept. 20 after they argued with two black youths at a McDonald's restaurant on Hamilton Avenue. They said Mr. Teague was then attacked in a case of mistaken identity.
