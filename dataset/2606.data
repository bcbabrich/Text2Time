A dead cow that had a positive preliminary test for mad cow disease on Friday tested negative on a confirmatory test, the Agriculture Department said yesterday.

The second test, done at the department's National Veterinary Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, is considered definitive, said Dr. John T. Clifford, the deputy administrator for animal and plant health inspection. The animal is considered not to have the disease, he said, and no other laboratory, including the British one that confirmed the United States' first case of mad cow disease last December, will be asked to confirm it.

Dr. Clifford would not give any information about the cow's age, breed, sex or place of slaughter. The carcass was held after the preliminary test and did not enter the human food chain, he said.

A second cow tested positive on a preliminary test on Wednesday, and the department is still waiting for the results of its second test, called an immunohistochemistry test.
