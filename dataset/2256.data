Hopes at NASA for good weather were high throughout the morning, which dawned bright and relatively clear. Dozens of government officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, came to the space center for the launching.

All morning, the issue causing more concern than the weather was a heater for one of the shuttle's six small thrusters that was not operating properly. But mission officials decided to work around that problem and launch anyway, since shuttle pilots are trained to work without all six thrusters.

Storms are another matter, however, and NASA does not launch when anvil-shaped clouds are near because of the potential for lightning.

A single anvil cloud began to dissipate before 3 p.m., but others began massing behind it. At 3:15, half an hour before the scheduled liftoff at 3:49, Bruce Buckingham, a NASA spokesman, announced, "We are still no go for weather."

The clouds near the launching site began to dissipate, but clouds massed over the landing strip â€” another condition that prohibits liftoff because good visibility there is needed in case the flight is aborted soon after liftoff and the shuttle has to be brought back to the Kennedy landing site. Two minutes before the countdown was to resume, Michael Leinbach, the launching director, decided to delay resuming it to see if the weather would clear before the day's window closed. Though the seven astronauts had been strapped into their seats in the shuttle, with the hatch shut at 2 p.m., the mission managers gave the order to cancel liftoff at 3:42.

Mr. Leinbach apologized to the commander, Col. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force. "Sorry to break your string," he said, "but we're not going to launch today." Mr. Leinbach added, "We're going to try again tomorrow."

Colonel Lindsey agreed. "We'll launch when we're ready," he said. "Hopefully, tomorrow will look better."

In a brief interview on NASA television, Mr. Leinbach said, "We played it till the end," but ran out of time.

"We can't control the weather, and we have very strict rules," he said. "It was very disappointing for the entire launch team."

But he added, "We're not going to launch the vehicle unless it's safe."

Normally, NASA waits a day after two unsuccessful launching attempts to give the astronauts, ground crew and mission controllers the rest that allows them to remain sharp; two more consecutive days of launch attempts would follow. If the shuttle cannot be launched before July 19, the next window opens in August.

Mr. Cheney, who was at Cape Canaveral with his wife and three granddaughters, said he was disappointed, according to Reuters.

"I was really looking forward to today, especially looking forward to having my grandkids here," he said. "But it was not to be today. Maybe it will work tomorrow."
