Exhibits in the other Tuscan towns are smaller and less demanding except to the most passionate student of Etruscology. An hour and a half or so seems to be the maximum amount of attention necessary for each, and the Cortona exhibit, charming though it is, is really worth no more than 30 minutes unless you are extraordinarily curious about the intellectual life of small Italian cities in the 18th century. Thus, having spent a good half-day at the main Florence exhibit, the visitor with a little more time to spare might want to combine two or three of the smaller exhibits with a tour through the Tuscan countryside.

One could, for instance, set out from Florence in the early morning for Volterra, 48 miles to the southwest. Volterra, an important late Etruscan city, is a strangely haunted place, at least in part because of a series of landslides that have carried away the western edge of the town, together with the Etruscan remains therein. The Etruscan Project exhibit, in the Guarnacci Etruscan Museum in the center of town, called Artigianato Artistico, or Artistic Craftsmanship, is devoted not only to the development of artistic styles, but also to the role of the artisan in Etruscan society, the structure of workshops and the circulation of ideas and styles throughout Etruria.

From Volterra, it is an easy drive south and east to Siena, past San Gimignano (of the many towers) and Colle di Val d'Elsa. A number of small agricultural settlements, dependents of Volterra, lined the heights above the Elsa River valley. W ith a little time to spare, a turn south at Colle di Val d'Elsa onto Route 541 will take you through the river valley, where there is little to see in terms of ruins but a good sense of the importance the valley had for the Etruscans. At the end of Route 541, take Route 73 northeast to Siena.

While the Siennese like to claim Etruscan origins, even going so far as to assert that their barebacked horse races are direct descendants of Etruscan games, there is little in or around the town to indicate anything more than a minor agricultural settlement, like those in the Elsa River valley, before a Roman colony was established in the middle of the first century B.C. Such types of settlement, however, are the focus of the exhibit called Case e Palazzi (Houses and Palaces) at the Spedale Santa Maria della Scala, in the Piazza del Duomo across from the cathedral. These little communities, which formed around individual families or clans, were gradually abandoned in the late seventh and sixth centuries as the cities gained greater influence. This is an exhibit that could not have been mounted 30 years ago, so much has our knowledge of Etruscan domestic architecture and settlement increased.

For a closer look at one of these settlements, take the Via Cassia (Route 2) south from Siena to the town of Lucignano d'Arbia. There a road to the right leads to Vescovadoand Murlo, where on a hill called Poggio Civitate, a little feudal barony or estate dominated the Arbia valley in the sixth century B.C. Except for the foundation walls, there is little to see from this important excavation. (The nearly lifesize terra-cotta figures, as well as other elements from the site, are displayed in the Siena exhibit.) What you do get, however, is a wonderful sense of the position of these little settlements, and the way they related to the surrounding countryside.

This is a splendid site for a picnic. Or, if you are interested in wine, you could take the gravel road back to Buonconvento and continue on the Via Cassia just a few kilometers to a right turn that will take you up to Montalcino, home of Brunello, one of Italy's greatest red wines. Il Giglio (closed Monday), in the center of town, is a fine place to sample the local cuisine as well as the wines. Just outside of town is the Fattoria dei Barbi, where wine from this well-known vineyard accompanies rather simple local dishes. (Closed Wednesday.) There are other interesting sites in the region around Siena, including the rock-cut graves of the Hepni family, prosperous Etruscan farmers, in Asciano, east of Lucignano d'Arbia, and the large burial mound at Montecalvario in Castellina in Chianti (reached by the old Strada Chiantigiana, Route 222, north of Siena). The site, which contains four chamber tombs, can be visited after getting permission at the town hall in Castellina. (Likewise the Hepni graves, at Poggio Pinci, may be visited on request at the Asciano town hall.) Continuing east from Castellina, on Route 429 past Radda, in the heart of the Chianti Classico region, leads to the Badia, a Coltibuono vineyard where the superb local Chianti is served in a restaurant connected to the vineyard, along with unpretentious but delicious local food. (Closed Monday and early September.) An Etruscan village site has been discovered on the grounds of this ancient estate and partially excavated by a team from Florida State University, but the site is not open to the public.

East of Siena lies the Chiana Valley, a rich agricultural terrain where farmers cultivate tobacco, corn and sunflowers. In ancient times this broad valley formed a vital link between the Tiber to the south and the Arno to the north, and even today the main north-south highway and rail lines follow the same route. On the steep eastern slopes above the valley, Chiusi, Cortona and Arezzo lie in a line from south to north. Cortona, the most interesting of the three towns today, was of lesser importance in antiquity - though a major center for the birth of Etruscology in the 18th century, as the Etruscan Project exhibit, L'Accademia Etrusca (The Etruscan Academy), demonstrates. Chiusi and Arezzo, on the other hand, were major Etruscan cities, particularly because of their positions as guardians of this important highway.
