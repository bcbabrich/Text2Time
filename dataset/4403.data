In a Perry Mason-like twist, a man named Dino finally appeared at a Rockland County carjacking and murder trial where the very existence of such a person had become the case's most tantalizing mystery.

But rather than a cut-throat drug dealer, he turned out to be a courtly barber, who, though he has a criminal record, now does volunteer work at an old-age home. He even spelled his name differently from the way Mr. Summers's lawyers had spelled it.

The witness made his surprise appearance at the trial of Edward L. Summers, a premedical student from the Bronx who has been charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery in the carjacking of a Jeep at the Nanuet Mall last Jan. 3 that ended in the fatal shooting of one of the two teen-age occupants.

Mr. Summers, 23, has attributed the crime to a flamboyant and fearsome neighborhood drug lord whom he knew only as Dino. In more than a week of testimony, Mr. Summers said that Dino terrorized him into driving to Nanuet to steal a Jeep, and that when Mr. Summers lost his nerve, Dino took over, commandeered the Jeep and shot its occupants. All he did, Mr. Summers said, was drive the stolen Jeep back toward the Bronx; he was arrested Bronxville, in Westchester County.
