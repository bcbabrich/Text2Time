To some mixed emotions, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History opens an exhibit today celebrating the United States Constitution. Six years ago it decided to commemorate the signing of the Constitution with a $1 million study and exhibition that documents the experience of 120,000 United States citizens and residents of Japanese dissent who were interned in isolation camps in World War II and of the 30,000 Japanese-Americans who fought with United States forces in the war. The exhibit is meant to be a reminder of the ''imperfection of our efforts to produce perfect fairness,'' said the museum's director, Roger Kennedy.

Although a 1980 Congressional commission labeled the internment program a breech of constitutional rights and a result of wartime hysteria and racial prejudice, Mr. Kennedy encountered no small opposition to his project.

Three times a request for appropriated funds for the exhibit was turned down by the Office of Managment and Budget. But the most overt disapproval has come from the public, in the form of several hundred hostile letters.

''For some people who were very deeply scarred by the Second World War, it is hard to distinguish between our fellow citizens of Japanese ancestry and those who inflicted the scars 45 years ago,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
