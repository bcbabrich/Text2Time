Those differing perceptions of flood control help explain why Donald E. Powell, federal coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding, announced on Thursday that the levees in the New Orleans region that were being rebuilt would not meet the insurance standard of protecting against a 100-year flood, the category that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.

The announcement was in many ways a candid admission that the old ways of building flood protection no longer applied.

Mr. Powell insisted that the $3.4 billion in work currently under way would make the levee system stronger than ever and prevent catastrophic failure in another storm of Hurricane Katrina's strength.

But he said work to bring the levees up to the standard required by the insurance agency would require as much as $6 billion in additional spending to raise levee heights, replace suspect floodwalls and take other corrective action.

If FEMA cannot certify the flood-stopping power of the levees, the agency's maps will have to treat them as if they are not there. In other words, as if the land behind them is unprotected.

That will have a significant effect on how neighborhoods will be rebuilt, how high off the ground homes will have to be constructed and the cost of insurance.

In the old days, before Hurricane Katrina and before global warming, experts assumed that New Orleans was protected by the levees that the corps had built. Since then, however, the emerging science of weather and climate change has led to an understanding that the world is entering a cycle of stronger and more frequent storms, with higher surges and waves.

Scientists have also discovered that the land under the New Orleans metropolitan area has subsided and that the levees are now lower than their original design height. Problems with the original design have also been found.

Fundamentally, the notion of what constitutes a powerful storm has been altered.

"We now have a new storm of record," Mr. Hitchings said. "Katrina."

The data drawn from the experience of last August changes the equation of risk, he said.

For all the new data, however, the levee system that the corps has been building is largely based on a model of a hurricane derived from data first collected in 1959. By the 70's, the National Weather Service had conducted new research that suggested that definition was too weak, but the corps did not alter its plans to accommodate the new data.

"The corps, once it's locked on a track, will not take input from outside groups," said Ivor van Heerden, a leader of the task force investigating the levee breaches for Louisiana and a professor with the hurricane center at Louisiana State University.

In a recent interview, Col. Lewis F. Setliff, the head of the team rebuilding levees, said the corps was not like the man on the street who is free to do what he pleases and change his mind at will. "We have to have a law in Congress that tells us to do something," Colonel Setliff said.

Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said the problem with that lack of flexibility was that "the data is not stable." Even the repairs, Professor Bea said, are problematic.

"They're building new walls, but they're building them to the old standard," he said. "But we already know the old standard is inadequate."

The corps has undertaken a two-year project at the request of Congress to propose substantial upgrades for hurricane protection in southern Louisiana. A preliminary report from that project is due in June, with a final report in December 2007.

If the study comes up with proposals for what the people of Louisiana say they truly want, protection against the strongest Category 5 storms, the cost would make the additional $6 billion look like a bargain. But it would more than exceed the insurance needs, Mr. Hitchings said, adding, "Obviously, if it was Category 5, it would be much bigger than 100-year protection."

D. J. Nordquist, a spokeswoman for Mr. Powell, said that "there's obviously a bigger question" facing New Orleans, which will always have the threat of storms.

"What level of protection are people comfortable with, and what are they willing to spend?" Ms. Nordquist asked. "What's even feasible?"
