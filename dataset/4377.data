In their announcement today, the six countries -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- said that they would support an initiative in the Arab League to consider ending the boycott entirely. The announcement, read by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia after a meeting with Mr. Christopher, said that the six gulf countries recognized "the importance of a review of the provisions of the Arab boycott of Israel so as to take into consideration progress achieved and substantive future requirements of the peace process."

At its meeting of foreign ministers in Cairo in August, the Arab League refused to even put the boycott issue on the agenda. Ending the Arab boycott is "linked to assurances of progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks" and in "ending Israeli occupation of Arab lands occupied in 1967," said Esmat Abdel Meguid, the Egyptian who currently heads the Arab League.

The United States protested strongly, and in the aftermath went back to the six gulf countries and urged them to use their annual meeting with Mr. Christopher at the United Nations to take a bold step.

Administration officials credit the intense lobbying of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, for bringing about today's decision. "Bandar was the key in unlocking it," one official said.

The Arabs have boycotted Israel since its creation in 1948 as a way to isolate the country and strangle its economy. The Arab League, which now has 21 members, imposed "secondary" and "tertiary" boycotts in 1951 on companies that did business in Israel and on companies that dealt with those on the blacklist.

The boycott has stood as a relic of history since the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement last year. But both Syria and Lebanon want to preserve it as a means to win concessions from Israel in their own peace negotiations.

Acknowledging its irrelevance, a senior Arab gulf official told reporters today, "It is very hard to reconcile Palestinians signing economic agreements with Israel while we are also boycotting American companies or British or Japanese companies." He added, "You can't be more royalist than the king."
