WASHINGTON, March 31— The American Jewish Commit tee said today that Roman Catholic and Protestant opinion, as reflected in major periodicals published throughout the coun try, has recently shown increas ing understanding of Israel's security needs and increasing support of Israel's sovreignty.

Details of a study of the American Christian press were reported at the opening session of a two‐day meeting of the committee's policy ‐ making Board of Governors. Rabbi Mare H. Tanenbaum, national inter religious affairs director, said in an interview that Roman Catho lic and conservative Protestant opinion “has shown an in creased commitment to Israel's needs.”

Rabbi Tanenbaum said that much liberal Protestant opinion had shifted from a previously “critical position toward Israel to a more sympathetic and even‐handed understanding.”

The report says that “what has emerged in early 1970 is a clear recogntion by Christian editors that Israel is no myth and really exists.” It quotes the Rev. John Sheerin, editor of the Paulist publication The Catholic World as saying that Israel's “existence is every bit as valid as that of numerous other states whose legality is never questioned.”
