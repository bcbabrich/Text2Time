After meeting with Charles Oakley and his representatives on Thursday, Dave Checketts, the Knicks' president, remains hopeful that Oakley will report to training camp starting Friday.

Checketts plans to meet with Oakley's representatives again before camp. Oakley, unhappy that he is locked into a contract with four years remaining that will pay him $2.2 million this season, has threatened not to report. Oakley is seeking an extension at the end of his current deal, a one-year balloon payment in the neighborhood of $10 million. The Knicks reportedly offered the forward a one-year, $4 million extension months ago that Oakley rejected. But while the two sides have not come to terms, Checketts said his meeting with Oakley was a positive step.

I think I understand where Charles is coming from," Checketts said. "I'm concerned about his situation, just like I'm concerned about anything that comes up. Charles has been respectful, and no one has told me yet that he's definitely not coming to camp."

Asked how upsetting it would be if Oakley, a co-captain, did not report, Checketts said: "I'm not going to speculate on that at this point. Obviously, Charles Oakley is a very, very important part of our team."
