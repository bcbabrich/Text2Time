''I do think it's true that future generations are going to find themselves making decisions about the allocation of long-term assets that were once made by state or corporate pension schemes,'' said Michael Morley, a Merrill Lynch private client specialist.

The American invasion has added to the competitive pressures on Britain's own fractured investment fraternity, which is heavily concentrated in London, and which has traditionally carved up the market between high-ticket stockbrokers, independent financial advisers selling pensions and insurance and a range of fund managers. In recent years, some of Britain's best-known private client stockbrokers have been forced into mergers and that trend may well continue. ''We expect a lot more change, a lot more consolidation,'' said Mr. Taylor at Merrill Lynch.

There is plenty at stake. More than 4 million Britons have financial assets -- pension funds, bank deposits and investments -- worth more than $80,000 and, of those, 1.4 million have assets of between $160,000 and $800,000, making Britain the world's fifth biggest personal financial services market, according to a Merrill Lynch study released last year and based on 1997 figures. By the end of 1997, this report said, Britain's private investors controlled assets -- including offshore investments -- of more than $1 trillion.

The Edward Jones approach, of course, is distinctive in Britain, stressing a Main Street presence and local contacts made from a one-person office, where advice is free and revenues come from commission fees and transaction charges.

Steve Jones, an American pioneer who opened an Edward Jones outlet in Sevenoaks last year, came from a similar operation in Wake Forest, N.C., and established himself in Britain, he said, by ''walking up and down the street'', seeking out the nameplates of accountants and solicitors for his client list.

Mr. Benarroch's own operation on Finchley Road in Golders Green is sandwiched between Diva's Italian restaurant and Co Co's Fitness Center. But while Co Co's offers ''rapid inch loss'' and ''the ultimate relaxing experience,'' Mr. Benarroch is hooked up by satellite and computer to the markets and is set to offer ''buy-and-hold'' investments, primarily in British equities, for the long haul. ''Some people come in wanting to make a quick fortune and we say they are not the people for us,'' Mr. Benarroch said.

If Britons resent the American approach, they are not saying so. ''As a woman, yes, it appeals to me because I feel comfortable coming into a place like this,'' said Susan Mindel, who runs a mail-order business in photographic supplies. Mr. Benarroch even won the endorsement of one representative of the British establishment, Lord Jeffrey Archer, who traveled to Golders Green to inaugurate the office and, thereby, press his campaign for London's mayoral elections next year. Pointedly, he noted that the American company said it was no fly-by-night. ''Those are the ones we like,'' he said.
