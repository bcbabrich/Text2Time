IT is not often that a Metropolitan Opera cast falls apart at a late hour with enormously satisfying results, but that happened with the season's first performance last night of ''Don Carlo.'' Aprile Millo, who sounds more and more like the young Verdi soprano we have been waiting for, stepped in as Elizabeth of Valois and gave the performance the firm cornerstone of vocal respectability that evenings at the Met have so frequently lacked of late. Mara Zampieri, who was to have made her debut in the role, was summarily dropped from the cast - kidney ailment being the official reason - at the dress rehearsal. Luckily, Miss Millo, scheduled to sing Elizabeth in the opera's last four performances, will now appear in all eight.

A single impressive contribution, however, would not add up to much in this gargantuan work, which in the Met's conscientiously uncut version inches close to the five-hour mark. Luckily, again, the company's long-range casting of Princess Eboli had broken down, which provided Shirley Verrett the opportunity to give what must rank as one of the season's most stirring performances. Whether in the Flamenco-tinged deep song of the ''Canzone del Velo'' or the dramatic and lyric fluctuations of ''O don fatale,'' Miss Verrett made a powerful impact. Many Metropolitan regulars must have spent the night wondering where in the world she has been keeping herself while the company has been giving mediocrities the run of the place. Yes, ''O don fatale'' should bring down the house, but Miss Verrett's did, and that is news these days on the west end of Lincoln Center's plaza.

If the two women were most worth singing about on this night, the male contingent held up its end respectably under the capable baton of David Stivender, who was leading his first ''Don Carlo'' here. Mr. Stivender, the company's chorus master, was another late addition to the cast, replacing Bruno Bartoletti for unstated reasons. Leo Nucci, perhaps not the stuff of legend as Rodrigo, was invariably sonorous. His ''O Carlo ascolta,'' directed in the old-fashioned style to the Family Circle instead of to his jailed comrade, stirred a lively response. It can be said of Giuliano Ciannella, the Carlo, that he looked handsome and sounded all right so long as the music stayed in his middle range. Even moderately high notes, however, were squeezed and effortful.

''Don Carlo,'' in no matter which of its several editions or versions, is an opera of confrontations. Certainly the most gripping is, or should be, the scene in which the Grand Inquisitor and King Philip II engage in a classic struggle between church and state. James Morris, as the Spanish ruler, and Dimitri Kavrakos as the blind old defender of the faith, produced suitably profound tones. Mr. Morris, though never quite suggesting the tortured, brooding presence of a Christoff or Siepi, two of his well-remembered predecessors as Philip, certainly has the vocal equipment and the stage sense to grow into this psychologically complex role. Right now, his interpretation is quite promising though without much dramatic resonance, perhaps in part because John Dexter's staging confines him to the standard operatic basso's glowering, stalking and cape-twirling.
