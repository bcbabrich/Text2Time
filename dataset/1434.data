Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.

In addition to the domestic challenge it presented, the fledgling Confederacy posed a foreign policy dilemma for Abraham Lincoln’s administration. The Confederacy hoped to use its position as a crucial source of cotton to secure recognition from foreign powers and boost its legitimacy, and it sent commissioners abroad to sway other countries into supporting its cause.

In response, Secretary of State William Seward threatened war against European countries who interfered in America’s domestic conflict. But the administration wasn’t the only branch to enter the foreign-policy fray: In July 1861 Representative Samuel Sullivan Cox, a Democrat from Ohio, submitted a resolution calling on Lincoln to share with the House “all correspondence with the English, French, Spanish, and other Governments with reference to the right of blockade, privateering, and the recognition of the so-called confederate States.” It passed with bipartisan ease, as did two more similar resolutions submitted during the following weeks.

Lincoln hardly welcomed such extensive oversight; on July 25, the same day that Representative Timothy Howe, a Republican from Wisconsin, submitted the third of the resolutions, the president sent word to the House that the “correspondence called for” would not be forthcoming at that time. The reason for the delay is unclear: of the three resolutions, Cox’s mentioned that the correspondence could be submitted “at the beginning of the next session of Congress,” and the administration appears to have taken that as an opportunity to wait as long as feasible to release the documents.

Eventually, however, Lincoln complied. In doing so, he not only provided his contemporaries and future Americans with an almost real-time, detailed look into the daily operations of the country’s foreign policy apparatus in crisis, but he set a precedent for State Department transparency that is still followed today.

Because the resolutions passed with little or no discussion, we have little direct evidence for what Congress was thinking at the time. But we can infer a few things from the broader context. For one, such requests were hardly unprecedented: throughout the early republic the legislature had asked for (and the executive branch had supplied) diplomatic instructions and dispatches related to treaties, boundary disputes and other foreign affairs. And of course, the war made foreign policy an especially touchy subject; by examining the correspondence, Congress surely hoped to see that Seward was instructing ministers to appropriately defend American interests, and that the ministers were faithfully carrying out the instructions.

After months of delay, Lincoln finally complied with the resolutions. On Dec. 3, 1861, as the second session of the 37th Congress got underway, Lincoln sent a message to both houses of Congress. The “message” portion of this communication was quite brief, but attached to it was correspondence between the United States and its ministers abroad, bound together in one volume (you can read the volume here).





Lincoln’s missive opened with a short discussion of foreign relations before turning to other domestic matters. He characterized the Confederate effort to gain recognition from foreign governments as sputtering and unsuccessful, noting “the disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country, in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected.” After dismissing Confederate diplomatic efforts, Lincoln announced that he had submitted the requested correspondence, and he hoped that those who read it would see that his administration had “practiced prudence, and liberality towards foreign powers, averting causes of irritation; and, with firmness, maintaining our own rights and honor.”

There followed 425 pages of correspondence between the government and its diplomatic ministers abroad (the United States would not have proper “ambassadors” until 1893). After printing a series of general circulars, the volume reproduced material regarding 24 countries: not only the major European powers, but most of Latin America and even Egypt, the Hawaiian Islands and Japan.

The material wasn’t for Congress alone; the White House released it to the public as well. For those who could not get their hands on the volume itself, copies of its contents traveled quickly up and down the coast, published in newspapers.

By perusing the documents, Americans could see how the Union defended its interests in countries large and small, near and far. Obviously, staving off Confederate agents was a key task for America’s ministers. Seward wrote to Carl Schurz, the minister to Spain, that preventing the Confederacy from gaining recognition was “your chief duty, and no more important one was ever devolved by the United States upon any representative whom they have sent abroad.”

Even in countries of lesser importance, ministers were urged to be on the watch. Although Seward did not believe that the Confederates would attempt to gain recognition immediately from Denmark, he wrote to his representative there that “political action even of the more commanding or more active States is influenced by a general opinion that is formed imperceptibly in all parts of the Eastern continent. Every representative of the United States in Europe has, therefore, a responsibility to see that no effort on his part is wanting to make that opinion just, so far as the true position of affairs is in his own country is concerned.”

Representatives abroad had an important public relations role to play, particularly when news traveled slowly across the Atlantic Ocean and rumors were rife. Seward’s instructions encouraged ministers to not let discouraging news from America cloud foreigners’ perceptions of the war effort. After the First Battle of Bull Run, in a letter marked “confidential,” he wrote to Charles Francis Adams, the minister in London, that “you will hear of a reverse of our arms in Virginia,” and encouraged him to think little of it. “The vigor of the government will be increased, and the ultimate result will be a triumph of the Constitution,” Seward wrote. “Do not be misled by panic reports of danger apprehended for the capital.” Seward likewise wrote to William Lewis Dayton in France that “treason was emboldened by its partial success at Manassas, but the Union now grows manifestly stronger every day.” Foreigners could get their news from any number of sources, and ministers had to stand ready to put a positive spin on events.

The volume also exposed domestic readers to the administration’s frustration with the willingness of the British to treat the Confederates as belligerents. This step granted the Confederates some credibility, even if it fell short of the full recognition they desired. In these documents, Northern readers could see unbiased proof that this action did not go without protest. Adams proclaimed to the British that the Americans were “irritated” by the British treatment of Confederates as belligerents.

Slavery is mentioned throughout the volume, although at this point in the war the rhetoric was more about the dangers of the political power of Southern slaveholders than the virtues of emancipation. Slavery certainly got credit for causing the war. Seward wrote to Dayton in France that “the attempted revolution is simply causeless. It is, indeed, equally without a reason and without an object, unless it be one arising out of the subject of slavery.” Seward instructed the representative in Russia that although slavery had existed in all the states at the time of the American Revolution, “it was expected that under the operation of moral, social, and political influences then existing the practice of slavery would soon cease.” The “cause” of the rebellion was the fact that the slave states, having suffered defeat at the polls in 1860, “took an appeal from the verdict of the people, rendered through the ballot-box, to the sword, and organized a revolution with civil war.”

The decision to release the material won glowing reviews. The Baltimore Sun reported on Dec. 9 that the correspondence was “receiving that close attention from persons skilled in diplomacy and public law which belongs to its distinguished source and the magnitude of the subject in question.” The Keene New Hampshire Sentinel reported that “in the whole of this correspondence, the Secretary of State exhibits marked ability as a statesman and diplomatist.”

By January 1862, the correspondence had reached the West Coast; the San Francisco Bulletin reported that the diplomatic correspondence was “quite voluminous” and “highly interesting.” Seward again came in for praise; his “high-toned” and “courteous” messages were “as nearly perfect models of diplomatic correspondence as are to be found on the pages of modern history.” The correspondence with Adams and Dayton “have swept to the winds all the aspersions of those who have accused him of favoring a timid and wavering policy in dealing with the rebels.” The volume attracted attention from abroad as well; shortly after its release, Lord Richard Lyons, British minister to the United States, sent a copy to Lord John Russell, the British foreign minister.

What can we learn from this volume of foreign affairs documentation released as the first year of the war drew to a close? First, it represents what the Lincoln administration wanted the American public to know about foreign affairs (as distinct from telling us in the modern day everything we might like to know about diplomacy during the Civil War). Judging by the newspaper response, Americans were pleased with how the federal government was acting. Publishing the documentation also exposed British and French actions toward the Confederates, which helped Americans direct their ire toward those two countries.

Second, the publication of the volume demonstrates the balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches during the mid-19th century: although the executive branch bore responsibility for foreign policy, the legislative branch could wield significant power by demanding to see copies of the documentation.

Perhaps most importantly, the volume illustrates an early attempt at government openness — and, given the exigencies of wartime, a surprisingly forthright one. The summer resolutions requesting the documents made an allowance for Lincoln’s assessment of the “public interest” in determining which documents not to submit to Congress, and we have no way of knowing what type of selection policy was in place. At the same time, the resolutions make clear that Congress expected to receive something. Indeed, diplomatic correspondence was released to Congress on an ad hoc basis throughout the early republic; but that it was still done in a moment of clear crisis demonstrates that Lincoln’s administration saw the value in getting the correspondence in the public’s hands.

There is a final consequence which no one in 1861 could likely have foretold: The State Department continues to publish edited collections of foreign affairs documentation, 150 years later. Although the Foreign Relations of the United States series does not release documents as rapidly as Lincoln did, and so has become a historical look at American foreign relations rather than a contemporary publication of documents, the release of the volume in 1861 set a landmark democratic precedent: that the American government must, on a regular basis, keep the public informed about its foreign policy operations.
