France said today that it would lift the visa requirement for United States citizens by the end of this year.

Most foreigners, except citizens of the European Community and Switzerland, are required to have visas as a security precaution. The requirement was imposed in September 1986, after a wave of terrorist bombings killed 11 people and wounded hundreds.

The Tourism Minister, Olivier Stirn, said today that the requirement was no longer necessary for Americans.

The visa requirement prompted protests by several countries.
