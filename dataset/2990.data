Travelers must now pay more to obtain or renew passports for overseas travel, particularly if they are getting one for a child.

Two weeks ago the cost of an adult passport rose more than 40 percent, to $85 from $60, while the renewal fee increased to $55 from $40. For children under 16, the fee increased by 75 percent, to $70 from $40. The cost of expedited service (guaranteed three-day processing) rose to $60 from $35.

Edward Dickens, spokesman for the State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs, said the increases were based on a long-standing federal law mandating that consular fees cover the cost of providing services. ''As costs go up, the fees have to change,'' he said.

Passport fees were last adjusted in 1998. SUSAN STELLIN
