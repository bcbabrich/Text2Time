For the first time since the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction began in 1991, the way to an unlovely peace appears to be opening, but several extremely difficult issues remain.

The door to negotiation was opened over a fifth summer of war by several crucial developments: a new balance of power, inimical to the Serbs, rooted in the growing strength of the Croatian Army; a new wave of expulsions -- of Serbs from Croatia and Muslims from Serbian-held eastern Bosnia -- that virtually completed the slicing up of the former Yugoslavia into ethnically homogeneous zones; and the political victory, consummated this week after more than a year of maneuvering, of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia over a much weakened Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic.

These internal developments were complemented by equally important changes in Western capitals and in the United Nations command in Bosnia that have made a resolution of the war more likely.

In Sarajevo, Lieut. Gen. Rupert Smith replaced Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose as commander of the United Nations forces in Bosnia and brought a complete change of style. General Smith pointed relentlessly to the fundamental contradiction of Western policy: The presence of United Nations peacekeepers in territory exposed to any NATO air strikes.
