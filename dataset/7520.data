The Ladies of Charity will hold their annual luncheon and bridge party to benefit the McMahon Memorial Temporary Shelter for Children on Thurs­day on the Starlight Roof of the Waldorf Astoria. The event is under the chairmanship of Mrs. John S. Burke. Mrs. Amadeo Giordana is president of the sponsoring organization.

The shelter, at 128 East 112th Street, provides a home in an emergency for babies under 2 years of age whose own homes are troubled or disrupted. The home is open for 24‐hour care provided by the Franciscan Mis­sionaries of Mary; 65 children can be accommodated. The Bu­reau of Child Welfare, courts, police, hospitals and other agencies refer the children to the shelter.

Mrs. Peter McDonnell is chairman of the advisory board, which is assisting with plans for the benefit. Other members of the board are Mrs. Allen D. MacLean, Mrs. J. Paul Carey, Mrs. John V. Mara, Mrs. John P. Carey, Mrs. William J. Mc­Cormack, Mrs. Matthew J. Car­ney, Mrs. James F. McDonnell, Mrs. Ashley T. Cole. Mrs. John P. McGrath and Mrs. Paul A. Corroon.
