The van, stuffed with blockers and the slight running back with the misleadingly vulnerable appearance, set out from a hotel on Canal Street and pointed west toward Baton Rouge and the home of Willie Wheeler. Warrick Dunn's grandmother was ready. There was crayfish etouffee, her grandson's favorite, and gumbo, and ribs, and macaroni and cheese, more than enough for everyone.

As Dunn approached the final days of his four years at Florida State University, a career that started with a painful departure from home was ending with a memorable return. For the offensive linemen that will lead him throughout the Sugar Bowl Thursday night against Florida, and for Pooh Bear Williams, the fullback whose son is Dunn's godson, here was a chance to go home with him.

''To me it's just a way of saying thank you,'' Dunn said. ''For the four years, and definitely this year, for the criticism those guys have been through. This is a big thank you. Thank you for keeping me healthy. Thank you for opening holes.''

There was also a message from his grandmother, whose football knowledge is said to be as extensive as her cooking expertise. ''I thought she'd threaten them that they better block,'' Dunn said.
