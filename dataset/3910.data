AS climate experts firm up their view that human activity is seriously altering the atmosphere, one voice stands out in clarion dissent. It is that of Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a shoemaker's son from the Bronx who has risen through the academic hierarchy as a leading expert on the physical processes of the atmosphere.

Is there truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate?

Dr. Lindzen does not equivocate. ''We don't have any evidence that this is a serious problem,'' he says flatly, with precise diction, in a friendly voice that resonates strongly in his 17th-floor office overlooking Boston across the Charles River. A clutter of folders and papers, coupled with Dr. Lindzen's untrimmed black beard and hornrim glasses, suggest the academic theorist he is.

His opinions attacking the formal consensus about climate change have made the 56-year-old Dr. Lindzen a bete noir to environmentalists who trumpet the dangers of global warming and a champion to political conservatives and industrial interests who minimize the threat. Admirers see him as a force for intellectual honesty in a highly politicized debate. Critics fault him for professing unwarranted sureness in a field of research rife with uncertainty. Many say he is simply wrong.
