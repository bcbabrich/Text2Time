To the Editor:

Re “They Help the Pregnant. No One Helped Them” (front page, Dec. 21), about accusations that Planned Parenthood mistreats pregnant employees:

Your investigation reminds us that all workplaces, including those in the progressive movement, must engage in critical self-examination to ensure that we challenge ourselves to meet the highest standards of equity and fairness.

The shocking truth is that in America there is no national program that ensures paid family leave to all working people — regardless of the size or financial resources of their employer. Our country also lacks a national legal standard that requires all employers to make reasonable accommodations when pregnant workers need them.

The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would change that. In holding institutions accountable, we must also demand that Congress deliver fairness for pregnant and parenting workers.

Employers, however, cannot wait for Congress to get it together. This moment calls for urgent actions by all institutions to ensure that equity, inclusion and safety are core values fully integrated into organizational practices. In the era of #MeToo, more workplaces are learning that it is not just a matter of fairness, but essential to achieving their very mission.
