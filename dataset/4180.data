O'Connor was impressed, as were others, with the spectacular wartime success of the killed-virus vaccine for influenza. He became convinced that its analogue might offer the short cut to the elimination of polio. On the advice of Thomas Francis, at the University of Michigan, who had headed the wartime flu-vaccine effort, O'Connor recruited young Jonas Salk to spearhead the effort to develop a killed-virus vaccine for polio.

O'Connor, with foundation funds, established Jonas Salk in his professorship at the University of Pittsburgh. Salk's applications for funding of his research and development had to pass muster, however, with the foundation's scientific advisory committee, made up of the most distinguished pediatric virologists.

They twice rejected Salk's applications. Upon his third try, the committee delegated one of its members (Frank Horsfall, then at the Rockefeller Institute, later president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and my informant in this aspect of the story) to assure O'Connor that they would not stand in the way of the grant.

The Salk-O'Connor campaign succeeded in getting the killed-virus vaccine through clinical trials in 1954 and made possible the national immunization campaign that all but eliminated polio from the population by 1960, before the live-virus effort had a safe vaccine ready for general use.

Outraged by the determination of the profession thereafter to supplant the killed-virus with the live-virus vaccine -- and the implication that the Salk vaccine had somehow failed -- O'Connor determined that the Salk achievement should have an appropriate monument.
