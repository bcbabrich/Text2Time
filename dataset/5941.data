The Standard Oil Company of California said its directors met yesterday with President Suharto of Indonesia in Jakarta to try to break a deadlock in talks over renewal of a contract for production of Indonesian crude oil by P.T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia, a joint venture of Socal and Texaco Inc. Caltex hopes to extend its contract until the year 2001, and has a deadline of November 1983 to complete negotiations. The Indonesian Government now receives 85 percent of the crude oil Caltex produces, and at issue in the negotiations is its request to receive more.
