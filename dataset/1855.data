Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed a bill this afternoon requiring manufacturers of computers, monitors, televisions and other electronic equipment to accept their products for recycling when returned by any person in the city, and to dispose of the equipment properly. The legislation was passed by the City Council last Wednesday, despite reservations by the mayor over its guidelines.

To ensure its passage, the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, had withdrawn the original bill and reintroduced it as two pieces of legislation, one that begins to establish the program and that Mr. Bloomberg agreed to sign into law, and one that sets collection standards that he is expected to veto.

Under the legislation that passed, electronics manufacturers will devise and run programs that could include curbside pickups, neighborhood collections and returns by mail and in stores. Consumers would be required to participate, and by 2010 would face a $100 fine for throwing old computers, televisions and other gadgets into the trash. Manufacturers who fail to recycle returned merchandise could be fined $1,000 for each violation. The programs would require Department of Sanitation approval.

Still uncertain are the collection standards, which would require manufacturers to take back a stated tonnage of equipment or face fines, an element that has angered suppliers, who say it would be hard to track sales in the city.

Twelve states have already adopted electronic waste laws. New York City is the first municipality to do so, the mayor said.

The mayor also signed bills requiring timely pruning of trees or vegetation that cover traffic signals or signs; requiring the cityâ€™s Department of Transportation to improve conditions at 20 locations with the highest number of traffic accidents; and extending the deadline for submission of the executive budget, for the fiscal year that starts July 1, to May 2 from April 26.
