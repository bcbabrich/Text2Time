ZAGREB, Croatia, March 31 - The Bosnian Serb authorities said Thursday that they were investigating nearly 900 officials of their own government to determine whether they had a role in the killings of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys from the town of Srebrenica in 1995 during the war in Bosnia.

A commission of inquiry has given Bosnian state prosecutors the names of 892 people accused of some responsibility in the killings, considered the worst mass killing in Europe since the end of World War II.

The list was drawn up at the request of Lord Ashdown, the British envoy who is the international administrator in Bosnia, after a report on the killings published by the Bosnian Serb government in December.

Until last year, the Bosnian Serb authorities had denied the extent of the killings, which were committed by Bosnian Serb security forces in a final push to create an exclusively Serbian state within Bosnia.
