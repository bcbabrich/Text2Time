Ending a conflict over the fate of a forest rich in both wood and wildlife, loggers, biologists and the government of Gabon have agreed to keep bulldozers and chain saws out of a 1,900-square-mile reserve with the highest density of large mammals ever recorded in a tropical rain forest.

The deal includes a slight redrawing of the boundaries of Gabon's Lope Reserve, subtracting 400 square miles of land on the southeastern flank that holds the richest stands of valuable okoume trees, and adding about 200 square miles of previously unprotected terrain that includes remote upland forests that have only rarely, if ever, felt the footfall of a human.

Several biologists working in the region say the net loss of land is worth it. The area opened to logging had been farmed less than 200 years ago and so is relatively recent growth. In contrast, they say, the newly protected area, which was to have been cut by Malaysian and French companies, is a priceless reservoir of biological riches that is thought to have been essentially undisturbed for the last 10,000 years.

More important, they say, the agreement -- signed last month by the country's major logging companies, the government, and a variety of private environmental groups -- finally brings meaning to the word reserve, with the government and loggers committing for the first time never to violate the new boundaries.
