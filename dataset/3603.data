IN the age of the indie, the independent-film-making movement, a Yonkers native and film maker, Joe Lovero, has joined the ranks of young writer-directors who use familiar surroundings to convey their stories without the financial resources of major film studios.

Mr. Lovero, whose company is called It Came With a Frame Productions, recently began filming ''Puppet, Love and Mertz,'' a comedy short about three creative people who will beg, borrow or steal to support their artistry. The film features Ian Lithgow of NBC's ''Third Rock From the Sun,'' Elisabeth Rohm, who is seen on ABC's ''One Life to Live,'' and Francis Jue of the Broadway play ''M. Butterfly.'' Mr. Lovero is directing and producing the film with JoAnn Gardner, a unit producer for NBC's megahit, ''Seinfeld.''

''We received 3,500 head shots and auditioned approximately 600 actors for the full script, which features 47 speaking roles,'' Mr. Lovero said during a location shoot in January at the Royal Regency Hotel in Yonkers. ''And we're certain that our film features some of tomorrow's talent today.''

Born, raised and educated in Yonkers, Joe Lovero, whose office is in the TriBeCa Film Center in Manhattan, has derived significant interest in his screenplay from some of the world's leading film studios. Because of this attention he was able to raise the money needed to shoot a 20-minute film adaptation based on what he envisions as the full feature of ''Puppet, Love and Mertz.'' Top technical staff and crew members from the film industry joined him, many as volunteers.
