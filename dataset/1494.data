A few months ago, Public Strategies, a Washington-based consulting firm, quietly polled the American public about its highest-profile client, Goldman Sachs.

Like those used in political campaigns, the poll was meant to offer Goldman empirical evidence — the numbers bankers love to work with — about the challenge it faces in battling widespread public resentment (and regulatory scrutiny) over the bailout of Wall Street and subsequent huge profits.

The results were not promising: 49 percent of respondents had a negative view of the firm, according to a person briefed on the report.

“If Goldman was a political candidate, it would be out of the race,” said one person involved in the process.

Warren Buffett, himself a fan of and investor in Goldman, summed up the public’s feeling about the world’s most profitable investment bank in an interview on CNBC: “I mean, they’re going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs offering the apple, I mean, pretty soon.”

With Wall Street — and Goldman in particular — still in the public’s cross hairs, the entire financial industry is grappling with how to remake itself. JPMorgan Chase has kicked off a marketing campaign called “The Way Forward.” Citigroup has started a blog for its top executives and just hired a deputy of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York to handle its communications. Morgan Stanley has pared back risk, and its chairman, John J. Mack, has been unusually vocal about the need for more regulation: “We cannot control ourselves. You have to step in and control the Street.”

And Goldman, which an online commentator compared unfavorably last week to the Catholic Church and Toyota, has begun aggressively countering negative press reports on its Web site and even in The Huffington Post.

The efforts of the big banks to make over their images is a big shift from a year ago. After Washington’s huge bailout of their industry, many financial services firms were unaware, or in some cases, unconcerned, about the growing public disapproval.

A Goldman spokesman, Lucas van Praag, confirmed that Public Strategies (a longtime consultant to the firm) had conducted the poll, as it has on previous occasions, though he would not disclose the results. A recent Bloomberg National Poll found that 57 percent of the public had a “mostly unfavorable or very unfavorable view of Wall Street.” (Corporate executives fared even worse, with 65 percent of respondents viewing them unfavorably.)

But the real question is whether Wall Street faces a public relations crisis — or something much deeper. And is all this bad press really hurting its business? The answer ultimately lies less in what the Average Joe thinks of Wall Street than in how his view affects those of clients, and perhaps more importantly, regulators.

And the public outrage so far doesn’t seem to have dented business, except around the edges. But it soon may.

Several private equity and hedge fund units within firms like Goldman and JPMorgan have slowed efforts to raise capital until more clarity emerges about proposed regulations like the so-called Volcker Rule, which would forcibly separate those businesses from their firms. Bank of America, trying to score some points with customers, announced a plan to eliminate overdraft fees, a move that will likely cost the firm tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue.

Arianna Huffington of The Huffington Post recently helped start a campaign called “Move Your Money” to persuade the public and businesses to transfer their money from big banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan to community banks. So far, it seems to be working, at least in small numbers: the City Council of Los Angeles recently approved a bill that requires banks to reinvest in the community.

There’s also the issue of attracting talent. Boutique investment banks, which wouldn’t be subject to many of the proposed rules, are poaching stars from their bigger rivals. And anecdotal reports from business schools suggest that Wall Street isn’t as popular as it once was.

Then there is the zeitgeist. A raucous debate emerged at Brown University when some students and alumni realized that Brown’s president, Ruth Simmons, was a Goldman director. She has said she will not run for re-election for Goldman’s board, though she denied that her decision was a result of campuswide pressure.

All of that may not be hitting the bottom line too badly right now, as regulation might. And on that score, the emerging consensus is that Wall Street is doing better in Washington than in the news media.

Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management of M.I.T., the author of a new book, “13 Bankers,” and a consistent Wall Street gadfly, recently wrote on his blog that the banks had successfully won over lawmakers.

“The public relations machines of today’s bankers may be even more effective than those of Morgan and Rockefeller, although the campaign contributions and control of the Senate exercised by those titans was immense,” he wrote.

“If the banks win this round, as seems likely, they will become even larger — and more dangerous. At current scale, our megabanks bring no social benefits and great social risks.”

Next week, Wall Street is likely to get another dose of bad press when the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission convenes another hearing in Washington. This session will include Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup’s former chief executive, and Robert Rubin, the former chairman of the Citigroup board’s executive committee.

At the height of the bubble, Mr. Prince famously said, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.”

Let’s hope he’s taking dancing lessons.
