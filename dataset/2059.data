CHARLESTON, S.C. – Between the 120 events of the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. here over 17 days and the 700 of the concurrent, city-sponsored Piccolo Spoleto Festival, who has time for anything more? Everyone, it seems, has time to party. Although the Spoleto Festival prides itself on not spending its own money on parties, its sponsors, models of Southern hospitality, pick up the slack with pre- or postconcert events in their homes — and how.

Last night’s main event took place in the luxurious garden of a grand home a block or so from the Dock Street Theater, where a kicky production of Gluck’s “Ile de Merlin” had just played. The fare consisted of hors d’oeuvres enough to form a lavish meal and drinks, including wine and, inevitably, planter’s punch, a deceptively potent mix of rum and fruit juices.

In fact, this was undoubtedly just one of several such gatherings last night. Nigel Redden, the festival’s general director, reports that he once attended 45 parties here in 17 days. “I’m sacrificing my liver for the arts,” he said.

One of the guests last night was Judith Vane, who calls herself the party lady. She served the festival for its first 26 years as hospitality chairwoman, presenting parties herself and cajoling others to do so. She said she was once told, “It must take a lot of nerve to ask someone to give a party for 150 people.” She replied, “I can ask anyone to do anything, as long as it’s not for myself.”

No fewer than 35 party hosts are listed in this year’s program, for an average of more than two a day. And if the purpose is boosterism, these partygoers party hard.

Before Spoleto, Ms. Vane said, chamber music meant “three little old ladies playing in the lobby of the Sumner Hotel.” The festival changed all that, she added, and at the same time changed the face of the city.

Nearby, Loren Ziff, a board member but a relative newcomer to Charleston (a Northerner with only 17 years here), agreed. Spoleto draws “countless people from around the country and the world to enjoy the city and the festival,” he said, “and neither would be the same without the other.”
