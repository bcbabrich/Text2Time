The Senate has approved a $252 billion military spending bill that includes an amendment barring the Pentagon from conducting training missions with foreign soldiers who have committed human rights abuses.

The United States military conducted training exercises with 102 foreign armies last year, according to Pentagon records. Some of those armies -- for example, the Indonesian military -- have a record of abusing their own citizens.

The amendment, proposed by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, would bar the Pentagon from holding joint exercises with human rights abusers unless the Secretary of Defense finds an extraordinary need to waive the law. The Pentagon did not oppose the measure.

The spending bill, passed by a 97-to-2 vote late Thursday, includes $1.9 billion for the open-ended United States military mission in Bosnia. The House version of the military spending bill provides no money for military operations in Bosnia.
