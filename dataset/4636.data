What? No Index?

For all the Washington insiders who were hoping to find their names in the index and so turned gingerly to the back of "What It Takes: The Way to the White House" (Random House), Richard Ben Cramer's much publicized 1,047-page look at the 1988 Presidential campaign and the reasons people run for President, the author had a surprise: no index.

The sputtering and the muttering could be heard in bookshops from Capitol Hill to Foggy Bottom to Georgetown. What do you mean, no index? Surely there must be some breakdown of who did what to whom, and on what page?

"I insisted that there was going to be no index," Mr. Cramer said in a telephone interview. "For years I watched all these Washington jerks, all these Capitol Hill, executive-branch, agency wise guys and reporters go into, say, Trover bookstore, take a political book off the shelf, look up their names, glance at the page and put the book back. Washington reads by index, and I wanted those people to read the damn thing."

Mr. Cramer said that, in fact, one of his most searing impressions of Washington after "imbibing the subculture of the floating political crap game" while he researched the book was that in Washington, "everyone will talk as if they have read a book, but nobody will actually have read it."
