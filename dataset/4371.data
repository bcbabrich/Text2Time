Moving to rescue the nation's capital from financial paralysis, the Senate today approved a $660 million appropriation for the city, just after Washington's Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, finished describing at a news conference how she planned to halt much of the government.

Without the appropriation, which the House had already approved, the District of Columbia would have suspended operations at midnight, except the functions essential to protect life and property. President Clinton this evening signed the measure, the last of the 13 appropriation bills for the new fiscal year, which starts Saturday.

But while city officials scrambled to complete their emergency plans, senators kept them on pins and needles as they spent hours debating whether to intervene in the major league baseball strike, waxing nostalgic about youthful trips to the ball park or praising idle home teams.

Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, called his high school graduation gift, a trip to the 1955 World Series in New York, "one of the jewels of my life."
