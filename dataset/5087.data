A message first seen last year on T-shirts worn by friends and colleagues of Michael Milken appeared yesterday as the headline of a full-page advertisement signed by dozens of prominent business executives: ''Mike Milken, We Believe in You.''

The advertisement's two-paragraph statement praised Mr. Milken, the former executive of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who pioneered the widespread use of ''junk bonds.'' Signers of the advertisement include prominent lawyers, financial executives and the chief executives of dozens of companies, like Mattel Inc., Kindercare Inc., Chock Full o' Nuts and the Western Union Corporation.

The ad appeared two days after Mr. Milken was indicted by a Federal grand jury on various securities law violations. The Government, which had sought Tuesday's indictment for almost three years, has charged him with 98 felony counts of fraud, racketeering and insider trading, and it is seeking unprecedented penalties of $1.8 billion against him and two other defendants.

The advertisement is the strongest, most public support yet offered to Mr. Milken by members of the business community, many of whom have been personally enriched by his financial dealings, and who say that the entire American business world has been greatly strengthened by his achievements.
