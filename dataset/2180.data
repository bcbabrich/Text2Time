BubbleMeter found a very funny quote in the online press release of Appraisers of Las Vegas.com. It is worth repeating here:

But, this is not a collapse, it’s just Las Vegas growing pains. To those who bought homes at the tippy top of the market, I’m sorry. Those homes have dropped a little because they were overpriced. But, overall, prices are higher and higher year after year. Las Vegas is more likely to be destroyed by fire and brimstone than have a collapse of housing prices.

Many have thought Vegas would get the Sodom and Gomorrah treatment. Take it with a pillar of salt. –DAMON DARLIN
