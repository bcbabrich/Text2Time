Frederick I. Herzberg, a psychologist who became one of the most influential management teachers and consultants of the post-World War II era, died in Salt Lake City Jan. 19 from a heart attack and injuries sustained in a related fall, according to Mark Herzberg, his son. He was 76.

Mr. Herzberg challenged assumptions that workers are motivated primarily by money and other tangible benefits. He argued that while low pay and uncomfortable working conditions could make employees so dissatisfied that they would perform poorly, fixing those problems was not enough to create effective labor forces. He called such factors in worker satisfaction ''hygiene.''

To truly motivate workers, Mr. Herzberg said, companies needed not only to achieve acceptable hygiene levels but also to institute practices that made people happy. His research pointed to elements including work that lets employees feel they are achieving something; makes workers responsible for particular tasks; and allows them to work with minimal supervision. Recognition beyond pay and advancement opportunities are also powerful motivators, he said.

''What he started out calling job enrichment led to many of today's theories about multiskill jobs and teamwork,'' said Jerome Rosow, director of the Work in America Institute, a Scarsdale, N.Y., research group. ''He was a major influence in the re-evaluation of the importance of human resources.''
