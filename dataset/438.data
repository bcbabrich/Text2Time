A Brace of Darcys

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1995)

Any discussion of Austen adaptations must begin with the BBC’s 1995 “Pride & Prejudice.” That stalking smolderer! That damp shirt! This mini-series starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy gave birth to the modern Jane Austen industry. And yet as hot as the production is, the screenplay, by Andrew Davies, is astonishingly faithful to the text. Huge swaths of it are word for witty word. Read a review of “Pride and Prejudice.”

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1940)

Dystopia and psychedelic drugs, you think, when you think of Aldous Huxley. But he is credited with writing this wickedly wisecracking confection that stars Laurence Olivier (he of the pride) and Greer Garson (she of the prejudice). The outright funniest of all Austen films. Good for a “spot the anachronism” viewing party, too: “That’s the most heartening piece of news since the Battle of Waterloo!” a delighted Mrs. Bennet exclaims when she hears that a single man of large fortune has moved into the neighborhood. The battle was yet to be waged. Read a review of “Pride and Prejudice.”

BRIDGET JONES’S DIARY (2001)

Helen Fielding’s affectionate sendup of the Colin Firth phenomenon doubles as a contemporary retelling of “P&P.” Renée Zellweger is an un-Lizzy-like Bridget, but Mr. Firth gamely revives his Darcy. Andrew Davies shares screenwriting credit again. Read a review of “Bridget Jones’s Diary.”

David Rintoul is the iciest of Darcys in the BBC’s pre-Firth effort. Feel the brrrrr.

DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY (2013)

O.K. not really an adaptation, since the late great mystery writer P.D. James set it six years after the Wedding. But if you are tired of Matthew Rhys racking up the bodies in “The Americans,” try his Darcy. (His on- and offscreen “Americans” co-star, Keri Russell, is the Mr. Darcy superfan of 2013’s “Austenland,” about which the less said the better.) Read a review of “Death Comes to Pemberley.”

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (2005)

Opinions are divided here. If you like your Lizzy more fierce than funny, well, this one is for you, Keira Knightley fans. A tad Brontean for some Janeites, who see too much Heathcliff in Matthew Macfadyen’s Darcy. (Carey Mulligan makes her feature-film debut here as the lesser Bennet sister, Kitty; she graduates to the villainess in “Northanger Abbey” two years later. See below.) Read a review of “Pride and Prejudice.”
