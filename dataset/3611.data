''The young families will be able to take advantage of an on-site day-care center, which is a first in a residential development in Westchester as far as I know,'' said Mitchell Hochberg, president of Spectrum Skanska, of Valhalla, one of three partners in the joint venture. The others are CareMatrix Corporation, of Needham, Mass., a provider of housing for the elderly, and Benenson Capital Company, a privately owned development concern based in Manhattan.

In designing the project, the developers borrowed concepts from ''new urbanism,'' which in its purest form is meant to create self-contained communities, with their own shops, schools and recreation.

''New urbanism really means trying to eliminate the car completely, and we're not trying to do that here,'' Mr. Hochberg said. ''I don't think that, in its purest form, new urbanism really works. What we're trying to do here is borrow the best of it, which means having all kinds of people together and give them space and reasons to gather. I think it's something that's been happening in other parts of the country, but it's been very slow in coming here.''

The houses will be designed to look like those in a place like Charleston, S.C., Mr. Hochberg said. The garages will be at the backs of the houses, with porches on the fronts, to encourage people to congregate outside. ''This way people can sit on their front porches and see their neighbors pass by on their way to the village green or the community center.

The focal point of the development will be an oval-shaped village green, which will be almost as large as a football field. The 18,000-square-foot community center nearby will have a pool, full-court basketball gym and a computer room. ''From 4 P.M. to 8 P.M., we'll have a teacher at the computer room,'' Mr. Hochberg said. ''We hope to attract 8- to 16-year-olds, and give them something to do after school.''
