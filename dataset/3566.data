Most politicians try to sidestep issues that divide voters along militant, angry lines. But New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, firmly rejected that kind of evasion when asked about late-term abortions during a trip to Texas.

The mayor said, with no apparent qualifier, that he did not plan to change his current position in favor of abortion rights to suit the leadership of New York's Conservative Party. Its chairman is calling on Mr. Giuliani to join other well-known Republicans in endorsing a ban on the late-term procedures that they refer to as partial birth abortions. But the mayor has steadfastly refused to alter his support of abortion rights. He did so again Monday in Texas in the company of Gov. George W. Bush, with whom he disagrees on this issue.

What makes the mayor's stand particularly stalwart is that it could easily jeopardize his nomination by the Conservative Party of New York State. No Republican has won a statewide election in the last 25 years without the Conservative Party line on the ballot, a position that generally carries from 200,000 to 350,000 votes. If the expected race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Giuliani tightens, those votes would look even sweeter than they do already. The Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, vows that he will not bargain on the issue. Mr. Long is even threatening to bring out an ''aggressive'' candidate to run on the Conservative line unless the mayor changes his mind and agrees to endorse a ban on late-term abortions. This extra candidate would surely siphon votes away from Mr. Giuliani and help Mrs. Clinton's chances.

Once next year's Senate campaign is in full throttle, Mr. Long may view things differently. Mr. Giuliani may eventually make a courtesy visit to the Conservatives and try to persuade them to respect either his principled stand or, at least, the political realities. But the Giuliani camp said that his basic position would not be compromised, making this a case in which the mayor's stubborn streak is well deployed.
