Not long after the owners of the infamous Watergate Hotel announce its condo conversion, two reports come out that say the Washington area has too many condos already.

The poor building–site of the break-in that brought down Richard Nixon, once the home of Monica Lewinsky, and designed by Luigi Moretti, the Italian architect who became a fascist and prospered under Benito Mussolini–just can’t catch a break.

MetroStudy’s Kenneth Wenhold, director of the company’s Virginia-Maryland division, predicted in an interview that so many condos are under construction or planned, particularly in Arlington and Fairfax counties, that “there is a very significant problem” of overbuilding and the potential for projects to go bust.

But, as must be required by some super-secret real estate industry pact, there is the caveat that things don’t look that bad:

But the report concludes that the expectations of continued strong job growth, strong housing demand and low interest rates, plus the relative lack of affordability of other kinds of housing, will keep condo sales from crashing in most markets, including in the Washington area. “We are likely to experience a soft landing in most major metro markets, but less gentle in others,” the Delta report found. Cities with the greatest risk of a hard landing — those with a lot of condo production and conversion, high levels of speculator activity and modest levels of job growth — are Las Vegas, Miami and Phoenix, the report said.

The reports come from MetroStudy, a Houston-based market research firm, and Delta Associates, an Alexandria-based affiliate of Transwestern Co. — DAMON DARLIN
