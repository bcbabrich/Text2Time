ANOTHER significant step in the protection of Long Island pleasure boatmen has been taken by the Nassau County Police Department.

In the Marine Bureau's shops at Bay Park, in East Rockaway, a new custombuilt 32‐toot fiberglass patrol boat named Marine 5 is being fitted out for launching this spring. She will be based in Freeport.

Deputy Inspector Edward H. Doherty. the 50‐year‐old bureau chief, said the flying‐bridge craft is powered by two 270‐horsepower V‐8 Crusader engines and is equipped with radar and a depth finder. She carries radios for police, marine, air and Coast Guard calls.

“While she is basically for patrol work, she'll also be used for towing. rescues and firefighting,” said Inspector Doherty. “She is stronger than the average boat and was made to our specifications by Hampton Shipyards. She cost $55,000 and we are in the process of installing $3,000 worth of Indian teak deck.
