The police have ordered the arrests of three more people accused of being Central Intelligence Agency operatives -- including a former official in the American Embassy in Rome -- bringing to 22 the number of people linked to the C.I.A and wanted in Italy for the kidnapping of a terror suspect from Milan in 2003. The suspect, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, a radical cleric, was flown to his native Egypt, where he was imprisoned and, his family says, tortured. All 22 wanted in the case are believed to have left Italy.
