A proposed three-way deal involving the Knicks, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Orlando Magic has been blocked by center Stanley Roberts of the Magic, who is invoking his contractual right to reject a trade.

According to several National Basketball Association front-office people familiar with the negotiations, the Knicks had agreed to trade Mark Jackson, their starting point guard, to the Clippers in exchange for forward Charles Smith, point guard Doc Rivers and shooting guard Bo Kimble. The Knicks had also agreed to send two first-round draft picks (1993 and 1997) to Orlando. Roberts would have gone to Los Angeles, and the Clippers would have sent a first-round draft choice to Orlando.

But Roberts is angry that the Magic did not notify him that they were working on a deal, Oscar Shoenfelt, the player's lawyer, said yesterday. Roberts is about to buy a house in Orlando, and when he was informed of the proposed trade, he decided to block the deal.

Roberts signed a five-year, $15 million offer sheet with the Dallas Mavericks in July, but the Magic matched the offer and kept him. Since the Magic stopped Roberts from going to Dallas, Roberts has decided to stop the Magic from shipping him to Los Angeles, at least for now.
