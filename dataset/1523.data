Flights from São Paulo to New York City take 10 hours. But what if I was asked to do the same trip, but taking my sweet time – say, three months – inching up the hemisphere by bus, Amazonian riverboat and, who knows, maybe even the occasional llama? That pretty much describes my dream trip. And on someone else’s dime? You can’t be serious.

Such was my reaction when the Travel section of The New York Times asked me to take over the Frugal Traveler blog from Matt Gross this summer. It turned out they were serious – down to the “dime” part. I’ll have a paltry sum to play with, enough to graduate from the hostel/rice-and-beans circuit, but not by much.

I’m not totally new to such challenges. Some of you might remember my Weekend in New York column with occasional videos. But traversing continents on the cheap is a different story. So before Matt fades off into the sunset, I called him from Brazil (via Skype, of course) , where I’ve lived since 2008. What I was getting myself into, and what he was getting himself out of?

Q.

So Matt, why are you giving up the Frugal Traveler column? Were you tired of scrimping?

A.

Traveling as the Frugal Traveler is an exciting thing to do. But several years of doing that takes its toll. It’s not the budget. It’s doing the same thing of any kind for that long. If I had been the Luxury Traveler for the last four or five years I’d probably be sick of that too, and wanting to move on.

Q.

What are you going to miss the most about being the Frugal Traveler that I can look forward to?

A.

What’s nice is having a defined persona. I knew who the Frugal Traveler was, and what his approach to anything would be. Matt Gross and the Frugal Traveler were never entirely identical: we shared about 95 percent of our DNA — about as much as a human shares with a chimp. (I’ll leave it to the readers to decide which was the chimp and which the human being). But I’m not going to miss much because my life isn’t going to change that much. I’m going to keep traveling, and I’m going to keep doing it frugally, because that’s my natural state.

Q.

Many readers may have often disagreed with you, but it’s obvious from the 200-plus comments on your final column that you had some very loyal fans. Any advice on how to keep them happy now that they don’t have Matt Gross to kick around (or hug) anymore?

A.

You don’t want to keep them happy. You should be provoking the readers. The readers come up with answers and solutions and ideas when you fail. And you will fail. There will be times when you do things wrong. When you spend too much money, when you miss seeing the really cool thing because you didn’t know it existed, and your readers will be there to tell you afterward. It’s nice to have the readers create a community around the thing you do. So it’s not just you out there. There are people who are rooting for you.

Q.

Were you ever envious of those who travel extravagantly? Did you consider a final column along the lines of “The Frugal Traveler blows $10,000 on fancy spa treatments at a high-end resort?”

A.

There are times that I wanted to travel that way, but I think it’s kind of boring to write about. There’s no drama. If you’ve got lots of money to pretty much buy anything you want and go anywhere you want, then what’s the story? It’s either a laundry list of truffles and Beluga caviar and chauffered BMWs or it’s a whiny, nitpicky list of what was wrong with the butler service. It can be entertaining if done right, but it’s not dramatic.

Q.

As the Frugal Traveler, you must get asked a lot of the same questions. What are those? And any clever replies that I can, um, borrow?

A.

The thing you’ll hear the most is “How did you get that job?” I tell people my real last name is Keller, but nobody gets that. Or I tell people the truth: “By total luck,” which is true.

Q.

How about those folks who say, wow, “You must have best job in the world?”

A.

I’ll say that it’s better than delivering pizza. Which is another job that I had that I really liked.

Q.

Pizza delivery and frugal traveling do have something in common, I suppose: you travel alone and have to make conversation with random people.

A.

Yeah, and you rely on tips.

Q.

Clever. Wish I had thought of that.

A.

Hey, I’m the subject of the Q&A here. I’m the one that’s supposed to be witty.

Q.

Speaking of “supposed to be witty,” I’m already overwhelmed by people making jokes about the fact that my last name rhymes with “frugal.” I guess I’ll just have to live with that. But there’s one thing I’m not sure how to handle. As a travel writer for The New York Times, we’re supposed to travel anonymously. How do you conceal your identity without trying to lie?

A.

I would sometimes tell people I’m a wealthy international playboy, but no one ever believed that. Or I would say I have a small regular income that allows me to travel widely but not luxuriously, which is true but doesn’t really give the full picture. Every once in a while people hear about something I’m doing and say “Wow, you should write about that, that would be a great story.” And I say, “Well, you know … ”

Q.

Yesterday, I had 234 Twitter followers. As of this morning, I’ve inherited 46,000 more, who have been following your tweets at twitter.com/frugaltraveler. That’s a 19,000 percent jump, which is sort of terrifying. Are they an unruly bunch?

A.

They’re usually quite helpful. When you have 46,000 people all over the world following your feed, it means you can get advice very quickly from a large percentage of them. They’ll often ask you questions, too. Probably the most often asked is “Can you recommend somewhere to stay and/or eat in Paris.” Luckily, I’ve written two or three stories about Paris, so I just send them to those.

Q.

What about those times when you tweet, “I’m on the corner of X Street and Y Avenue in Phoenix, and I need to find a good taco.” If that works, it’s amazing.

A.

It absolutely works. Just give yourself a little time for responses to come in. Like seven or eight minutes.

Q.

You’ve written about your dislike for buses, but that you’re going to try to use them more. I’m considering taking a bus ride for this summer’s trip that will take 30-something hours. Should I do it?

A.

My main issues with buses are routes, schedules, missing stops, things like that. This sounds like the kind of thing where you’re getting on at the beginning of the ride, and you’re getting off at the end of the ride. If that’s the case, you’ll be fine. But to be on a bus for 30 hours and then miss your stop would be the ultimate nightmare.

Q.

I found it intriguing that during your hike from Vienna to Budapest, you threw away your underwear as you used it. Given your underwear expertise, the ultimate travelers’ question: how many pairs of underwear should I bring on this Latin America trip?

A.

Eight.

Q.

Enough for a week with one to spare. Seems right. A bunch of my friends suddenly want to tag along this summer. How can I warn them about what it’s like to accompany a dictatorial travel writer?

A.

You need to tell them that you’re working, and that you’re going to be running around, doing all kinds of stuff constantly for the story. The first couple years, a lot of people managed to either come along or to meet me, but recently the trips have been longer and far-ranging. Also, a lot of my friends have regular jobs now.

Q.

Do I have to grow a beard to be the Frugal Traveler?

A.

Yes.

Q.

Do that help save space? I’m kind of worried about finding Mach3 cartridges when I’m the middle of nowhere.

A.

That was my first thought, that I would grow the beard and that I wouldn’t have to worry about carrying anything to trim it. But if you have a huge, unkempt, untrimmed beard you look scary, and no one will speak to you.
