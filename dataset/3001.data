Major League Baseball attendance fell by 6 percent this season, the largest drop since 1995, when 20 percent fewer fans came to stadiums after the settlement of the players strike that eliminated the previous year's playoffs and World Series.

Attendance for the 30 teams was 67.9 million, the lowest total since 63.2 million in 1997, when there were 28 teams. Last year, attendance was 72.2 million, according to the commissioner's office.

''We think the economy had a lot to do with the drop,'' said Rich Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball. ''A lot of industries are suffering.''

He said the threat of a possible strike ''had something to do with it.''

Baseball releases only paid attendance figures, which do not not reflect how many people are actually at the games.
