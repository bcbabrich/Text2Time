Arizona Diamondbacks Manager A.J. Hinch did something odd after his pitcher Edwin Jackson threw a no-hitter last Friday: He defended his decision not to pull Jackson from the game. When a starter has not allowed any hits, a manager ought to feel comfortable leaving him in the game.

But the recent trend of limiting pitch counts to preserve arms makes Jackson’s 149-pitch performance stand out. For example, the Nationals’ emerging phenom, Stephen Strasburg, was pulled from a potential no-hit bid in the minors this year. It wasn’t that long ago when the complete game, no matter how many pitches it took, was the mark of a good outing.

To get a sense of how unusual Jackson’s performance has become, it was only the third time since 2000 that someone had thrown that many pitches. Livan Hernandez, well known for his durability, threw 150 pitches for the Nationals against the Marlins in 2005, and Randy Johnson threw 149 pitches for the Diamondbacks against the Expos in 2002. Compare that with the 1990s, when at least 49 pitchers threw 149 or more pitches in a game.

But what damage did Hinch really do by leaving Jackson in the game? Despite all the recent fuss over pitch counts, there is not much evidence that isolated high-pitch performances damage pitchers.

Recently, Sean Forman, the creator of Baseball-Reference.com, and I conducted a statistical analysis of the impact of pitch counts on starting pitchers from 1988 through 2009 (the research will be presented at the Society for American Baseball Research convention in Atlanta next month). After controlling for many factors, we found that single high-pitch-count games did appear to have a real but small negative impact on future performance. Every pitch over the average output increases a pitcher’s expected earned run average in the next game by about 0.007. Based on his 5.05 E.R.A. and average of 104 pitches a game before last Friday, Jackson’s expected E.R.A. for his next start will be about 5.37.

Furthermore, the Diamondbacks gave Jackson an extra two days of rest before his next start. Rest days have only a tiny positive impact on performance, in this case lowering his expected E.R.A. to 5.34. Over all, it is a significant diminishing effect, but not so large that it should cause a manager to pull a pitcher from a no-hitter.

Keep in mind we are analyzing this as an exceptional, one-time jump in pitching load. If Jackson continued to throw close to 150 pitches a game, his productivity would suffer to a much greater degree. Averaging a high pitch count over five games has double the impact of a single game, and a high pitch count over 10 games has triple the impact, potentially raising Jackson’s expected E.R.A. by nearly a run. Although we did not address injuries in this study, past analysis has not found a link between pitching loads and injuries.

So while allowing Jackson to stay on the mound might have been against his protective instincts, Hinch made the right call. The accolades and attention received probably outweigh the price that the team and Jackson will pay from extending him for a single game.

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:

Correction: July 7, 2010:

An article on Friday about the recent trend of limiting pitch counts to preserve a player’s arm misidentified the team that Livan Hernandez threw 150 pitches for in a game in 2005. He was pitching for the Nationals against the Marlins, not for the Marlins.
