Re “What That McCain Article Didn’t Say” (Feb. 24):

The beauty of the Feb. 21 front-page article about Senator John McCain is that it was constructed in such a way that The New York Times could go either way with it, depending on how the public responded.

If the public bought in, the paper could leverage the impact with expanded editorial and Op-Ed coverage. If the public thought it was a lot of hooey, which they did, they could go to Plan B and send the public editor into the fray to apologize for any misunderstanding and point out that the story did not actually say what it was intended to suggest.

Either way, The Times would keep alive a story that the public correctly recognized as insubstantial.

Why assume that the volume of correspondence on a particular topic automatically reflects the “consensus” opinion of all Times readers? It’s not necessarily that “most readers saw it as … ,” but rather that most writers to The Times and you “saw it as …”

The Times has had plenty of front-page coverage of embarrassing disclosures about Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Where was the reader or public editor outrage on those?

I’m assuming The Times didn’t make up the concern by Senator John McCain’s advisers over the appearance of impropriety in his relationship with a female lobbyist. Their concern factually existed. The Times reported those facts. Where is the controversy?

The Times didn’t say Mr. McCain had an affair. It said his advisers repeatedly confronted him with their concerns. Any aftermath to this story should be limited to whether his staff members did or did not have such concerns. If they did, Mr. McCain and his supporters need to accept the facts of the situation.

Until you hit the paragraph beginning “The pity of it is that, without the sex, The Times was on to a good story,” you were doing your job superbly. But that particular paragraph is a cheap retelling of the story. Since you did not uncover it, and are not a political opinion editor, you should not, in my opinion, be airing it at all.

Bravo for your report on the McCain article. Alas, it’s not going to weigh as heavily in the public’s mind as the original article.

I am really contemptuous of the self-serving statements that Bill Keller, the executive editor, has issued in response to the outcry. He’s trying to justify the unjustifiable. If anyone thought The Times was wrong in the first place, Mr. Keller really drove the point home.

I continue to be bemused by what seems to me the overwhelming misreading of The Times’s Feb. 21 article on John McCain. The idea that Mr. McCain alarmed his aides by misjudgments with regard to “appearances” seems completely plausible and in no way constitutes an allegation of actual misbehavior.

Your column about the John McCain article was more harmful than beneficial. You reinforced the idea that there was fire behind the smoke, again without any evidence. After months of research by four reporters, this was a good story?

An undefined “complex relationship” is not a good story. It may be a potential subject for a story, but without any kind of evidence other than insinuation and innuendo, there is no story. When The Times reports by innuendo, many people believe that there is something behind the innuendo.

The Times will be able to sell its credibility like this for political purposes for a while, but not for very long. Any good work the Times could do in the future, as it has sometimes in the past, is tainted.

I read the John McCain article the day it appeared, before reading any of the backlash that followed. I did not take it to mean he had an affair, I took it to mean what it said, that his aides thought he might be having an affair and were concerned about the appearance.

I thought the article was clear about what was known (aides were concerned), what was not known (whether he had an affair) and that there was no evidence of anything more than friendship.

Kudos to The Times reporters who wrote the fine piece. Nothing in the article will change my decision to vote for Mr. McCain if, as everyone now expects, he is the Republican candidate.

I read the original Feb. 21 article with quite some dismay on the day it was published. I have followed the furor that has ensued, and have read with particular interest the questions submitted online by readers and the responses from Bill Keller and the news editors.

The questions posed by the readers were intelligent, insightful and pointed. The responses from the editors were defensive, sloppy and off the point.

Surely the senior editors of The Times realize that when they put an incendiary accusation of sexual misbehavior in the second paragraph of a front-page article, readers will focus almost exclusively on that issue. This was a scandalous statement more fitting for The National Enquirer, and it was spotted as such by the readers.

If it makes any difference, I am a Democrat who supports the efforts of Barack Obama.

I am a retired editor of two Scripps Howard newspapers and was in the business for 34 years. The Feb. 21 article on John McCain (I am not a McCain supporter) is one of the most egregious and irresponsible stories that I have ever read in any newspaper. I was shocked that The New York Times, of all papers, would publish it.

It is an embarrassment to the profession. The responses of the executive editor, Bill Keller, and other editors to your commentary on this story were nothing but overly defensive hogwash.

I will leave it to the experts as to when a story meets the proper standards for publication. But if Senator John McCain maintained a close friendship with a lobbyist and used his influence on behalf of her clients, I would prefer to know about it than not.

It seems as though that aspect of the story was not incorrect and properly bears on the election this year.

Moreover, if a personal relationship between the senator and the lobbyist was the concern of the Mr. McCain adviser who was a Times source and there was no particular reason to doubt that adviser, then it was fair to report that fact.

The whole issue of unnamed sources is an interesting one in reporting, yet sometimes it seems the only way to get to the facts.

Early in the article, both Senator McCain and the lobbyist were reported as denying having had any romantic relationship. The thrust of the article was clearly about the senator engaging in possible conflicts of interest.

Bruce Neuman

More than anything, the McCain story reminds me of the CBS National Guard story about President Bush in 2004. Both stories were around for years.

Both relied on questionable sources and shaky evidence. Both were kept alive by media outlets long after their shelf life had expired, and both, if true, were less important than either CBS or The Times claimed them to be. And both had as their target Republican presidential candidates.

Why did The Times pursue the McCain story for so long? The Times was not overly concerned with Bill Clinton’s fitness for president in the wake of his affair with Gennifer Flowers. And The Times reported zero evidence of special favors from John McCain to the clients of the lobbyist his advisers were “convinced” he was having a “romantic” relationship with.

Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, justifies passing off some smelly old news of an assumed indiscretion by Senator John McCain that took place in 1999 as a current happening by saying that omitting it “would not have reflected the essential truth of why the aides were alarmed.”

You note that the Feb. 21 article was about something that happened “during McCain’s first run for the White House eight years ago.” Is that news?

And the rehashing of Mr. McCain’s long-ago ethical slip during this current campaign has the earmarks of a “gotcha” story and a platform to regurgitate Mr. McCain’s “poor judgment” in intervening with federal regulators during the savings and loan bank investigations.

The Times need not worry so much about being the first as it should about being correct.

It seems you want The Times to dumb down its coverage. I, for one, totally buy what Bill Keller and Jill Abramson and other Times writers have said regarding why they went ahead with the Feb. 21 article on John McCain.

For understanding, patient people, all that needed to be said was said. There was no reason at all for anyone to come away from that article thinking that John McCain must have had an affair with the lobbyist Vicki Iseman.

But yes, perception matters. And that is what The Times editors have been insisting on.

Please, encourage patience and encourage literacy.

Thanks for restoring my faith in The New York Times, which was badly shaken by the Feb. 21 feature on John McCain.

I was one of the 2,400 letter writers you mention in your column. It’s nice to know that the ombudsman’s role is working under your watch, particularly after the failure by two key editors, Bill Keller and Jill Abramson.

When I read the Feb. 21 front-page article, I did not get the sense that it was in any way suggesting that John McCain might have actually had an affair or that that was important. The prurience in this case is purely in the eyes of thousands of emotional and cynical readers who need to learn how to read newspaper articles more objectively.

I am very glad that the attitude of the advisers to Mr. McCain was described by the article, both because it is factual and because it indicates the seriousness with which Mr. McCain’s aides took the situation. It would have been more politically astute for the article to have simply omitted the fears of an affair felt by the aides. That would have been easy. But it would have been a loss for people who want to have objective information about the hidden world of lobbyists and how they affect our politicians and government.

Your conclusion gave in to the forces of silence. Let The New York Times publish many more fearless articles like the one on Mr. McCain!

Your column about the reaction from the public to the Feb. 21 front-page article about Senator John McCain deals with the reason the reporters and editors decided to include the romantic aspect of the story. As you point out, that isn’t the real substance of the article, and you go on to state about Mr. McCain’s dealing with lobbyists that “it was still worth pulling together to help voters in 2008 better understand the John McCain who might be their next president.”

Yet you leave out the background and facts that the initial story did, instead of helping the reader decide where the truth lies.

You suggest that The Times was on to a good story, absent the relationship component. I disagree; The Times was on to a good Op-Ed piece, not a good news story. And most certainly not a front-page story.

The Times has unfortunately repeated Dan Rather’s mistake from the 2004 election. It went with a story before it had the facts.

Re “The Doctors Are In. The Jury Is Out.” (Feb. 17):

I was startled by your juxtaposition of the topics of mercury in tuna (it affects adults) and mercury in vaccines (it doesn’t affect babies). But something’s missing. We know that mercury toxically affects all living things. Even if we buy that it has nothing to do with autism spectrum disorders, why wouldn’t it cause neurotoxic damage to babies at least as much as it does to adults? After all, the babies are still developing.

What would that affect look like? How would it manifest?

While I’m willing to not call it autism, what is the name that we can give it? What’s being done to help those children with their unnamed (unacknowledged?) mercury damage?

Don’t you see a disconnect here? I do.

Anne Van Rensselaer

As the mother of three children, one of whom has autism, I hope that you will learn more about the vaccine-autism controversy for yourself.

I believe that many intelligent people would draw the same conclusions about vaccine safety that I have if they learned more about the issue beyond what is being reported in the mainstream press and by agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The C.D.C., the F.D.A. and other organizations and agencies have a vested interest in denying problems with vaccines. At the same time as thimerosal has (we hope) been reduced in vaccines, the number of vaccines continues to increase, from 10 in 1983 to 36 in 2008 on the C.D.C.’s schedule. The cumulative effect of so many vaccines has not been studied.

Do we really know what we are doing to the developing immune systems of babies when we give them 36 vaccines, 29 of them by the age of 2?

The door on this controversy is not closing! It is opening wider and wider.

I appreciate your comments on the difficult issue of how laymen, including journalists, can evaluate conflicting medical research.

As a writer on health care policy, I am always taking a very opinionated view on policy issues, but I have to work hard to avoid straying into medical issues or evaluation of treatments in which I have no competence.

It is good to see that someone at The New York Times is alert to the importance of this.

I am glad that you looked into the important topic of a possible connection between childhood vaccines and the alarming increase in autism among children.

But thimerosal was not “removed from children’s vaccines in 2001.” While levels of mercury were reduced, they were not eliminated from most such vaccines produced after 2001. And those containing the full dose of mercury were never recalled and remained in use, perhaps through 2004 or even later.

Mercury remains in full force in flu vaccines given to infants and pregnant women, so fetuses and infants continue to be exposed to mercury in these shots, in addition to the mercury they breathe and eat.

Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. The Environmental Protection Agency considers mercury to be toxic and dangerous at levels found now in many fish and in the air in some locations. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has for years widely promoted mercury-containing children’s vaccines and flu shots for youngsters and pregnant women, and continues to do so. One of the agencies has to be wrong.

It cannot be that mercury is harmful in fish and air, but not when injected into human bodies. Why keep using our children as human guinea pigs ?

It is true that many authorities discount the effects of mercury on incidences of autism, but there are many who concede that the disconnect is not clear.

You state, “Thimerosal, the preservative in question, was removed from children’s vaccines in 2001.” But some vaccines still contain trace amounts of Thimerosal. While some may regard this as insignificant, I would note that there may be no threshold level of exposure to mercury that is absolutely safe.

I was disappointed in your comments about fibromyalgia. As a professional who works in social services, I have seen both clients and staff who suffer from this very real and painful disease.

One client, a very positive, intelligent woman with many health issues, says that her fibromyalgia is by far the most difficult thing she has to deal with. I can’t schedule her in the mornings, as she often cannot move.

I also have a good friend who deals with this on a regular basis, and it has affected his life so much that he has been unable to continue in his line of work.

Remember that just a few years ago, many diseases — including some mental illnesses — were not thought to be as varied and real as they truly are.

Fibromyalgia is a very real disease that is just now being realized and researched to the level it should be.

The problem with the Jan. 14 fibromyalgia article, and your assessment, is that some diseases, like multiple sclerosis, have no test to determine whether a patient has that disease.

These diseases are diagnosed by a set of observable criteria, and many patients show no medical evidence at all of their suffering, except the obvious development of the disease.

While there are supportive comments regarding fibromyalgia in the article, the negative comments are far more opinionated. It’s quite clear what the reporter believes.

Re “Fuzzy Election Math, Before and After” (Feb. 10, 2008):

You quote Janet Elder, the editor in charge of polling, as saying that “we are much more conservative in allocating delegates than everyone else is.” I would use a different word: I’d say that The Times’s policy is, clearly, prudent.

I applaud The Times’s stringent counting of delegate votes that excludes nonbinding votes for candidate preference, such as those resulting from caucuses.

But then why does The Times include a survey of superdelegates in some of its charts of delegate totals? Aren’t these superdelegates the most nonbinding votes of all? The inclusion of superdelegates clouds the intent to provide the most accurate and unbiased assessment of tallied votes.

I’ve complained in the past about what I felt was The Times’s incomplete summary of delegates awarded.

Bravo!

Bob Collins

There are two logically consistent, intellectually defensible ways of reporting counts of delegates:

Report only counts of pledged delegates, omitting estimates of caucus-state delegates and estimates of superdelegates. Or, report counts of pledged delegates, estimates of caucus-state delegates and estimates of superdelegates.

A responsible news organization either reports no estimates or reports all estimates. A responsible news organization does not pick and choose which estimates to report.

The approach used by The Times is not “conservative.” It is unsound. It systematically overstates support for Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In view of the fact that the editorial board of The Times has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, it is difficult to escape the impression that the counting approach used by The Times is designed expressly to overstate support for Mrs. Clinton.

Richard H. Ebright

North Brunswick, N.J., Feb. 10, 2008

The delegate count on The Times’s Web site is completely unfair and biased toward Hillary Rodham Clinton. The chart I saw today gives the impression that Mrs. Clinton has a strong lead in the delegate count, when she is in fact behind in pledged delegates, and barely ahead if you also include superdelegates.

The Times says it has chosen to exclude all the caucus results because they haven’t been set in stone at the state primaries yet, but yet it includes the unpledged superdelegates, based on its own polling. The superdelegate count isn’t any more certain than the caucus count.

The Times should either include both caucus and superdelegates in its total, or neither. The best way to do it would be to have two counts, one for pledged delegates and one for superdelegates, so everyone can see who is actually ahead in the popular vote count, and who is ahead among party insiders.

By confusing the two, The Times is enabling Democratic National Committee insiders to throw the election to Mrs. Clinton, even if Barack Obama wins a majority of pledged delegates. Such dishonesty shouldn’t be allowed for something as important as our presidential election.
