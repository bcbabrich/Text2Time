Harris County, Tex., and the Port of Houston Authority situated in that county are revamping their finances with a new $618 million bond issue that will be used to refund all their previously issued bonds.

Tentative interest rates on the new bonds were announced yesterday by underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company. For unlimited tax bonds, yields ranged from 5.60 percent for bonds due in 1986 to 7.40 percent in 1990, 8.60 percent in 1995, 9.20 percent in 2000 and 9.50 percent in 2006. Yields were higher by one-tenth of a percentage point for a companion issue of limited tax bonds.

Although all the bonds are rated triple A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the financing is divided into limited and unlimited tax bonds. The unlimited tax bonds are backed by the ability of the county and the port authority to levy property taxes without limit, while the limited tax bonds are backed by the county's ability to levy a property tax up to 30 cents per $100 of market value. The limited tax bonds have a higher yield because, in theory, they are less secure than the unlimited tax bonds.

Despite the difference between the two kinds of bonds, the limited tax issue was assigned the highest triple A rating because the county's financial condition is strong and because its tax levy of about 5 1/2 cents per $100 of market value in 1984 was far below the legal limit.
