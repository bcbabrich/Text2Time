The emotionally charged Hamilton Tiger-Cats staged one of the most unexpected upsets in Canadian sports history today when they routed the Edmonton Eskimos, 39-15, in the Grey Cup title game.

The underdog Tiger-Cats forced Edmonton to commit 10 turnovers, and the aggressive defense sacked the Eskimo quarterbacks, Matt Dunigan and Damon Allen, 13 times. Hamilton stunned the crowd of 59,621, a B.C. Place stadium record, with 17 first-quarter points to take command of the 74th Canadian Football League championship game.
