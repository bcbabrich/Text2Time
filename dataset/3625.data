PORK and beans, an American canned classic, consists of two working parts. There are the beans, of course. And then there's the small white blob. The National Pork Producers Council has a problem with that blob, which is why delegates at its national convention passed a resolution last month calling on food companies to replace the blob with a chunk of lean pork.

At a time when America's hog farmers have reduced the fat content of pork by 31 percent over the last decade, they feel the blob -- which is salt pork, which is all fat -- sends the wrong message.

The council's Iowa chapter wanted more: new guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration that would either get lean pork ''and perhaps more of it'' into pork and beans, or remove the word ''pork'' from the label on the can. That won't happen. The national council said it was unrealistic, pointing to the agency's most recent pronouncement on the issue. ''It has for years been recognized by consumers generally,'' the 1996 guidelines state, ''that the designation 'beans with pork,' or 'pork and beans' is the common or usual name for an article of commerce that contains very little pork.''
