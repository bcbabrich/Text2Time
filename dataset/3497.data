Allan Carr, the producer behind the popular movie musical ''Grease'' and the Tony Award-winning Broadway hit ''La Cage aux Folles,'' died on Tuesday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 62 and also had a home in Palm Springs, Calif.

The cause was liver cancer, Ronni Chasen, a longtime friend, said.

In a varied career that included stints as a publicist and manager, Mr. Carr was noted for his shrewd timing and keen nose for new talent. He was perhaps just as renowned for his penchant for camp, most notably as the producer of the 1989 Academy Awards telecast. That show's opening number featured a squeaky-voiced Snow White singing ''Proud Mary'' with the actor Rob Lowe, prompting legal action by the Walt Disney Company.

A party-giver par excellence who favored ''large-man caftans'' during the 1970's, Mr.Carr once feted Truman Capote in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.

Reared in Highland Park, Ill., Mr. Carr attended Lake Forest College and entered show business after studying briefly at Northwestern University. His first venture was as one of the creators of the Playboy Penthouse Television series, which helped pave the way for Hugh Hefner's Playboy clubs. He was also responsible for the opening of the Civic Theater in Chicago, where he underwrote ''The World of Carl Sandburg,'' with Bette Davis and Gary Merrill; Tyrone Guthrie's production of ''Mary Stuart,'' starring Eva Le Gallienne, and Tennessee Williams's ''Garden District,'' with Cathleen Nesbitt and Diana Barrymore.
