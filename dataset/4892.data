An Enemy of Esthetic Boundaries

Like many of his contemporaries, including such artists as Vito Acconci, Siah Armajani and Kim MacConnel, he was concerned with dissolving esthetic boundaries, in particular the one between the fine and the decorative arts. The art historian Robert Rosenblum said of him yesterday: ''Scott was as singular and unique as a person as he was as an artist. His fiercely laconic work destroyed the boundaries between furniture and sculpture, between private delectation and public use and radically altered the way we see many 20th-century masters, including Gerrit Rietveld and Brancusi.''

Mr. Burton's own sculptures, which could be used as tables and chairs when they were not on exhibit, often infused the plain abstract forms of Minimalism with a sense of utility, history and wit. To accomplish this, the artist drew on his wide knowledge of furniture - a passion since childhood -both modernist and vernacular, 19th and 20th century.

He was inspired by tensile chairs and tables of Rietveld, the Dutch De Stijl designer who, like Piet Mondrian, specialized in simple geometries and primary colors. Further inspiration came from the round stone table and stools that Constantin Brancusi created as a memorial for the fallen of World War I in Tirgu Jiu, Rumania. But he also took ideas from Art Deco designs, the common American lawn chair, as well as rustic or Adirondack furniture made from bark-covered tree trunks and branches. Among his favorite tactics was the unexpected use of luxurious materials. One work combined galvanized metal with mother of pearl; another, a table made of pink onyx was lighted from within.

Formal Study in High School

Mr. Burton was an only child, born in 1939 in Greensboro, Ala., to Walter and Hortense Moberly Burton. His parents separated when he was quite young, and in 1952 he moved with his mother to Washington. There his interest in art led him to study informally with the painter Leon Berkowitz while still in high school. Shortly after graduation from high school, he also studied for a time at Hans Hofmann's painting school in Provincetown.

Uncertain that his passion for furniture and design could ever lead to an artistic career, he turned to literature, obtaining an B.A. from Columbia in 1962 and an M.A. from New York University in 1963. By the mid-60's he was working regularly as a freelance critic for Art News, then under the editorship of Thomas B. Hess.
