The war of the cola giants -Pepsi and Coca - threatens to wipe out the third world of soda pop. The supercolas have already swallowed 7-Up and Dr Pepper and there is grave doubt that Royal Crown Cola can survive as an independent carbonating force.

This is an old story, the concentration of power in few supercorporations and the disappearance of the rest of the competition. You don't have to be an antique to remember when the Hudson, Packard, Studebaker and Nash were as easily identifiable by American youngsters as the Chrysler, Ford and General Motors cars.

Now, of course, the surviving American auto brands look so much alike that it's hard for anybody to identify them.

Same for beer. You constantly read stories about how there used to be thousands of beers, but now there are only three that do any business, and one of them is on the ropes. Being allergic to beer, I am no judge, but people who drink the stuff tell me that one brand of American beer tastes so much like another that a blindfold test would leave them baffled about which they were drinking.
