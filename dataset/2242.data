Brazilians’ hopes for the World Cup are high, as Larry Rohter reports from Rio in today’s Times. “All the stars are aligned in our favor,” one fan told Rohter. “We’ve got the talent, the experience, a favorable draw and a steady-handed coach” — Carlos Alberto Parreira — “who has already guided us to one Cup.”

But at least one of the stars came unaligned today when it was announced that the Barcelona defender Edmilson has dropped out of the tournament with torn knee cartilage.

The Guardian speculates that Edmilson’s role on the team — as a kind of stopper or holding midfielder alongside Emerson — will be taken by Gilberto Silva of Arsenal.

UPDATE: This post has been corrected to reflect the fact that, as several readers pointed out, Edmilson was expected to play for Brazil in the Cup but was not in the projected starting line-up announced by the coach Carlos Alberto Parreira last month.
