The three biggest television networks -- ABC, CBS and NBC -- filed a copyright infringement lawsuit yesterday against the maker of a digital device that functions much like a videocassette recorder. The complaint was filed in the Federal District Court for Central California against ReplayTV Inc. and its corporate parent, Sonicblue Inc. ReplayTV makes a device much like the better-known TiVo unit that records television programs on a big hard disk. ReplayTV, however, recently introduced a new version of its machine that allows users to set it to skip advertisements and to transmit recorded programs to other people over the Internet. An intriguing aspect of the lawsuit is that NBC, which is a unit of the General Electric Company, is an investor in ReplayTV, as is the Walt Disney Company, which also owns ABC. CBS is owned by Viacom Inc. Seth Schiesel (NYT)
