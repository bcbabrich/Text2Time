''DAMN YANKEES,'' at Jones Beach, is what it is; so is its star, Joe Namath. A production at Jones Beach is not like productions elsewhere: Zachs Bay laps at the set; fog rolls across the stagelights; for $1 you rent a blanket to keep warm. Mr. Namath is different, too. He is not so much a performer as a personality, and the wonder is not that he can sing or act well, but that he can sing or act at all. Dancing, however, is beyond him, although once or twice he does sway in time to music.

Nonetheless, Mr. Namath has genuine charm. He smiles a lot. He sings in a light baritone, or, when he is having trouble, in an amiable bellow. His perfectly capped teeth are like little beacons on the vast Jones Beach stage, and when he appears bare-chested in a locker-room scene people in the audience go, ''Ooooh.'' It is unclear if they are recalling Mr. Namath as football player, or Mr. Namath as sex symbol, but probably it doesn't matter. Mr. Namath is carrying out a successful flirtation; the audience is responding. The personality, if not the performer, has it made.

Meanwhile, there is Eddie Bracken as Mr. Applegate, tramping through ''Damn Yankees'' with a wonderful, sturdy professionalism. Mr. Applegate, of course, is the devil, who offers a middle-aged insurance man baseball immortality in return for his soul. Consequently, ''Damn Yankees'' is a show about our innocence. Its assumption is that baseball - the sport, not the big business, entertainment spectacular it has become - is worth selling your soul for. Its further assumption is that the only thing better than baseball is a good marriage. In a world like that, even the devil has his good points. Mr. Bracken, blustering, conniving, comic and oily, finds all of them.

As always at Jones Beach, the big ensemble pieces work better than anything else. Susan Elizabeth Scott, a long-legged, amusing Lola, leads the mambo number (''Who's Got the Pain'') and Alyson Reed, an almost equally long-legged, amusing Gloria, the sports reporter, leads the Washington Senators number (''Shoeless Joe From Hannibal, Mo.''). The Richard Adler-Jerry Ross score is still awfully good, and at the Lost Souls Cafe (''Two Lost Souls'') everyone sings and dances except Mr. Namath. He is perched high above the stage, out of harm's way, looking on benignly. What's a personality for, anyway?
