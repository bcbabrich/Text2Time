It was 50 years ago last week that New York University pulled off what is still regarded as the greatest college-football upset in the city's history. At the end of a season that had begun with a 60-0 loss to Ohio State and had included only four victories in eight games, all over weak teams, the wilting Violets blossomed into legend by defeating previously unbeaten Fordham and its Seven Blocks of Granite, 7-6, in a Thanksgiving Day game that drew 50,000 to Yankee Stadium.

To mark the anniversary, the N.Y.U. Varsity Club will honor surviving members of both teams at a dinner tomorrow night. The hero of the game, Howard Dunney, whose series of coffin-corner punts are credited with keeping the Rams in a hole they could not dig out of, won't be able to attend, but there will be a worthy stand-in: Sal Somma, the blocking back who kicked the extra point that made the difference.

''I've gotten a lot of mileage out of that,'' says the 76-year-old Somma, who from 1948 to 1976 coached at Staten Island's New Dorp High School, where he won half a dozen city championships. When New Dorp found itself behind at halftime, Somma recalls, he would cite the famous upset in persuading his players that ''no matter how things look, you can still win.''

The 1936 game, played a year after the Rams had spoiled an undefeated N.Y.U. season and a sure invitation to the Rose Bowl by beating the Violets at the Polo Grounds, has spawned a few myths. One of them is that Fordham missed out on a trip to the Rose Bowl because of the loss. In fact, that hope had pretty much been dashed the week before, when the Rams were tied by Georgia, 7-7, after their earlier 0-0 tie with Pitt, the team that ultimately got the Rose Bowl bid.
