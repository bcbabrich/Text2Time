To the Editor:

In the article ''What's Doing in Vienna'' (Travel, Dec. 12), mention is made of the fact that opera tickets can be ordered from Vienna.

Your readers might be interested in knowing that they can also be ordered, along with hotel reservations and other tourist services, through Dial Austria with no fee to the purchaser. Dial Austria is located at 1414 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10019, and the telephone number is 212-838-9677 (or outside New York State tollfree 800-221-4980). GERRY HEALY, New York
