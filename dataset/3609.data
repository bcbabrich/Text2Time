WHILE THE frozen streets here glistened with new-fallen snow, the entrances to galleries and museums were aglitter with the same curvilinear glass vase filled with tulips. More than a harbinger of spring, the recurring vase evoked the spirit of its designer, Alvar Aalto, whose centenary this year is the cause for the festive mood in this capital city.

Though Aalto is the best known internationally, he was only one of many Finnish designers and architects whose works defined this country's Modernist sensibility. Streamlined, practical and durable, these designs are familiar in homes and offices all over the world. In addition to the Aalto vase, there are the ergonomically perfect Fiskars scissors, the Everyboy striped shirt made by Marimekko and the red enamel coffeepot designed by Antti Nurmesniemi.

The centerpiece of the recent events here is the reopening, after a major interior renovation, of the Museum of Art and Design along with a new permanent display that chronicles the history of Finnish modern design. Situated in a Gothic-revival school building, the museum, which opened in 1873, is the oldest in Scandinavia devoted to design. Its stores have grown rich enough not only to fill its own sleek showcases but also to make generous loans to the Bard Graduate Center in New York for its current exhibition, ''Finnish Design: Utopian Ideals and Everyday Realities, 1930 to 1997.'' This show of 144 works was organized by Marianne Aav, curator of the Finnish museum, and her counterpart at Bard, Nina Stritzler-Levine.

To appreciate the evolution of Finnish design, one has to understand the history of the country. From the 12th century on, Finland was under the dominion of Sweden until it was conquered by Russia in 1809. Finnish architecture began to flourish under the czars, and, with its pale-ocher columned buildings, Helsinki took on the neo-classical style that made it the equal of St. Petersburg. When Finland became independent after the Russian Revolution in 1917, its designers, already leaders at international expositions, turned from a romantic tradition and used their work to assert a new identity. And in time, Finland tied its economic future to a strong domestic industry in the design of modern products.
