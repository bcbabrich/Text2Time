But the Clinton White House, like previous Administrations, citing national security issues and fears of foreign terrorists or criminals, is loath to permit the export of some of the most powerful data-scrambling software. The reason has chiefly been that intelligence agencies feared such equipment would be used by foreign terrorists, drug cartels and other criminals to hide transactions and communications.

Now, in a compromise, according to two senior officials in the Administration who have been deeply involved in the new policy, American companies will be permitted on Jan. 1 to export software that encrypts, or scrambles, data using ''keys'' -- lengthy numeric codes -- that are up to 56 bits long. Until now, companies have been prohibited from selling products abroad that have keys longer than 40 bits.

Mr. Clinton has also decided to move the authority for exporting the encryption software from the State Department, which has had export-licensing authority because the technology has been classified as munitions, to the Commerce Department, which controls the export of products that have both commercial and military use. Industry officials have long urged that change, betting the Commerce Department would be more inclined to give a higher priority to American competitive interests.

But starting in two years, American companies choosing to export the more sophisticated software would have to set up what the industry is calling a ''key recovery'' system. That system would enable intelligence officials and law enforcement agents, armed with court warrants, to go through a lengthy multistep process that would give them the mathematical key to decoding scrambled communications.

The approach replaces the Administration's earlier proposed ''key escrow'' system in which the Government would have been the repository of the numeric keys -- leading to fears of potential Government abuse, or a reluctance by legitimate foreign users to buy the software.
