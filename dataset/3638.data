New York State's highest court today upheld an investigative panel's findings that Elizabeth Holtzman, the former New York City Comptroller, had violated the city's conflict-of-interest laws when she took a campaign loan from a bank trying to obtain city business.

In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals also said that Ms. Holtzman not only used her office for personal gain but also thwarted the bank's efforts to obtain repayment of the $450,000 loan at a time when the bank was seeking a lucrative contract from the city.

The decision marked the final chapter in a case that had sullied the name of Ms. Holtzman, once one of the city's most prominent political figures, who lost her race for the United States Senate in 1992 and lost the Comptroller's race a year later.

Hours after the decision was announced, Ms. Holtzman, who now practices law privately, assembled a news conference in Manhattan, where she apologized for her behavior and expressed regret for the incident. Then, as reporters looked on, she held up a copy of the loan document, grabbed a cigarette lighter and set the document on fire before dropping it in a wastebasket.
