To the Editor:

In her article "Challenging the Asian Illusion" [ Aug. 11 ] , Gish Jen says that the musical "South Pacific" perpetuates the myth that the Asian woman is "more delicate, more willing to sacrifice for her man, more docile." This may be true of the daughter, Liat, but what about her mother, Bloody Mary, who outfoxes the whole American Navy? Is she not a 1944 prevision of those stubborn little Vietnamese women of 1965 who played a major role in defeating the entire American Army? JAMES A. MICHENER Texas Center for Writers Austin, Tex.
