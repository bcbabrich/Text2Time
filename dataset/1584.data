In this weekend’s Your Money column, I take a close look at an ING Direct mortgage promotion that turned up in the mailbox at Bucks headquarters in Brooklyn. Turns out the company broke one Federal Reserve rule related to adjustable rate mortgage disclosures and didn’t meet my own common sense/raised eyebrow standard over all.

This isn’t the first time I’ve had uncomfortable discussions with ING Direct about its mortgage marketing. A few months ago, I had to convince the bank that the difference between percent and percentage points really did matter when you are promoting six-figure loans.

I don’t do this sort of thing because I dislike ING Direct. Quite the opposite.

Company executives talk about being on the side of the customer and trying to simplify things with every new product they offer.

Given those high standards — and the fact that ING Direct ought to be standard bearers for its peers (even if their high-yield savings account rates don’t offer the best rates anymore) — the expectations are higher, too. And the failures are all the more disappointing.

So does a mortgage company have an obligation to say in all its ads and mailings how much an adjustable interest rate or payment may rise? Or is it enough to tell people later, after they’re well into the application process?

And what other bit of simplification or new information would you like to see in this industry? You can bet that Elizabeth Warren is thinking about these things, since she’s made mortgages a high priority for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
