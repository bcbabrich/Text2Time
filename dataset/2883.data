The Bush administration's meetings with the Iraqi opposition illustrates the situation it faces as it seeks to balance its tough oratory about Iraq, Iran and North Korea with the concerns of allies, fearful that the administration is elevating military options above diplomacy.

Seeking to reassure American allies and to avoid details about a policy that has yet to be fleshed out, President Bush and his top aides have avoided direct references to potential military action. Today, Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, gave a speech in which she underscored that the United States wanted to work with its allies to deal with threats posed by Iraq, Iran and North Korea and listed the nonmilitary steps they could take. These included strengthening export controls, encouraging the Russians to stop the leakage of their missile or nuclear technology and developing antimissile defenses. Ms. Rice alluded to military options in the vaguest of terms, saying the United States would ''use every tool at our disposal to meet this grave global threat.''

Administration officials say that military force would not be a desirable way to confront North Korea or Iran. But an energetic debate is under way in the administration about the use of military force to topple Mr. Hussein. Mr. Bush has vowed to take tough, if unspecified action, if Baghdad pursues developing weapons of mass destruction. But his administration has not completed its review of Iraqi policy, and Defense and State Department officials have been divided about the credibility of the Iraqi National Congress.

Civilian Pentagon officials favor a plan in which the model of the Afghan campaign would be adapted to Iraq and expanded. Iraqi insurgents would do the brunt of the fighting though American Special Forces would probably be deployed. American air power would pummel Mr. Hussein's military. But it is widely agreed that Iraqi insurgents are not nearly as capable as the Northern Alliance was in Afghanistan.

To create a military option, the Iraqi National Congress has long sought training in antitank warfare, calling in American airstrikes and in the use of military police to control newly conquered territory. So an important issue before the Bush administration now is whether the United States should take on the task of training Iraqi insurgents, as Pentagon civilians would like, or whether the military option is impractical.
