TORONTO — Sometime during that third quarter, amid the whirling, sneaker-squeaking, pass, cut, shoot-from-anywhere California storm that descended on the Toronto Raptors, this thought occurred to me:

The Warriors are the vampire artistes, and that makes them more interesting than I anticipated.

One after another they fall injured and limp down the alley to their locker room only to reappear later as if arisen from the crypt. So Stephen Curry looked listless and ill and retired to the Warriors locker room in the first quarter; he returned a few minutes later to score 16 sly sleight-of-hand points and lead a crucial charge before halftime. And Andre Iguodala, who has played for so long he appears a figure out of 19th century hoops, banged his head hard on the court earlier — and at game’s end he squared and drained the clinching 3-point jump shot in the Warriors’ 109-104 victory.

Klay Thompson, who has a metronomic shooting touch, disappeared late in the game with a strained hamstring that had him hobbling as though on a peg leg. But heed the words of Steve Kerr, the team’s coach: “Klay said he’ll be fine, but Klay could be half dead and he would say he would be fine.”

Ah, yes, that old dodge known as death.

Then there was DeMarcus Cousins, who stands at 6-foot-11 and 275 pounds and who can be a balletic wonder on the court. He began this season recuperating from a torn Achilles’ tendon. He returned midseason and was rounding into shape when in the first playoff series he fell writhing to the floor with a torn quadriceps.

He returned to play eight minutes in the first game of this series and looked encrusted with rust. Kerr complimented Cousins before Sunday’s game, but when he predicted we may “see him a little bit more tonight,” you shrugged off the happy talk.
