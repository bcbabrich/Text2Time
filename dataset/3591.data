Immokalee, a town of about 20,000 people in southwest Florida with one of the biggest and poorest labor reserves in the state, sits in sharp contrast near wealthy municipalities like Naples. Tomato pickers in Immokalee say all production costs have gone up except their pay, with growers covering their higher costs by saving on pickers.

Depending on the time of the picking season, which runs from September to May, workers can make as much as $100 a day or as little as $30, they say, but by year's end most of them average a salary of $8,000 to $10,000, well below the poverty level of $13,300 for a family of three. That is enough for a life style of crowded housing conditions, often in trailers, with no telephone, no car and no meat on the table most days. There are no health, vacation or pension benefits, either.

Pressing their case through the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a grass-roots group with about 750 members, the tomato pickers are seeking an average raise of 20 cents a bucket, to 60 cents, which they say would have a negligible impact on tomato prices. They also want to end a practice called ''day and a dime,'' which pays a flat wage for the day plus 10 cents per 32-pound bucket picked. Coalition members say that the system encourages workers to pick more but that at the end of the day it pays less than the piece rate.

''Our focus is to restore our salary to the equivalent of what it was 20 years ago -- that's 20 cents more per bucket,'' said Lucas Benitez, 22, a former picker who now works for the coalition. ''We're not asking for an increase or any benefits.''

Last year 2,000 workers signed cards supporting the coalition's call for a raise. In December, 700 to 1,000 workers participated in three one-day strikes, a calibrated action that is used sparingly because most workers cannot afford to miss a day's pay. But only one grower has even acknowledged the workers' request to meet.

That grower, Gargiulo Inc., one of the biggest, agreed to raise the pay per bucket by 10 cents, to 50 cents over the next year, an action the coalition says shows that its salary demand is one growers can afford. Gargiulo and other tomato growers in the area contacted for comment did not return telephone calls.

Mr. Gilmer, of the growers' group, said a recent survey of tomato growers in the area showed workers making $6 to $12 an hour, with the average worker making $8 to $9 -- higher than the national average for farm workers of $7.31. But coalition members counter that the figures are inflated and that the implied annual salary, more than $16,000 for a 40-hour week, 52 weeks a year, is not representative because picking is not a regular job. If the growers wanted to pay workers an annual salary, the coalition says, pickers would gladly accept less, like $15,000.
