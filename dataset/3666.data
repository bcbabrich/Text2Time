To the Editor:

Re ''The More the Books, the Fewer the Editors'' (Arts pages, June 29):

Although your article on the decline of editing in book publishing touched almost all of the issues involved in the increasing prevalence of sloppiness in book editing, you do not mention the existence in every publishing house of a staff of production editors whose largely thankless job it is to hire freelance copy editors, proofreaders and indexers, to review their work and to collate at each stage of the production process the author's corrections.

On paper, at least, it reads like quality control, and as recently as 10 years ago, that is precisely what it was.

In today's bottom-line, time-constrained publishing climate, however, the job amounts to no more than damage control -- performing a kind of triage on an entirely ad hoc basis, under incredible pressure, all the while chanting the mantra ''Not in my book, please'' about the really horrifying mistakes we know are out there waiting to happen.

In this context, the remarkable thing is not only that some of us still care, but that there aren't more mistakes.
