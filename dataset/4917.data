The space shuttle Atlantis pierced a cloud-strewn night sky with fire and thunder early today as it lifted off on a secret military mission.

The shuttle, lighting the sky from horizon to horizon with the whitish-yellow glow of its powerful booster rockets, carried a five-man crew into orbit on what was expected to be a four-day flight to deploy a large satellite to spy on the Soviet Union.

Liftoff at 2:50 A.M. from the Kennedy Space Center came after five previous delays caused by adverse weather, illness of a crew member and the malfunction of a ground-based tracking computer.

Showers Delay Countdown

The countdown for the flight was held up while a line of showers passed over the space center. It was quickly resumed when weather forecasters and an astronaut circling the area in a jet determined that skies were clear enough for a safe launching.
