Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, buoyed by investors' optimism that the trade talks between the United States and Japan could produce an agreement.

A report, later denied, of an agreement on Japanese Government procurement contracts bolstered the dollar in the world currency markets, making dollar-denominated assets like bonds more attractive.

In addition, the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodity futures, considered a leading indicator of inflation, fell 0.82 point, to 229.85, easing investor concern about rising prices for basic goods.

The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/32 , to 9614/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.81 percent, from 7.84 percent on Thursday. Shorter-maturity issues were mixed.
