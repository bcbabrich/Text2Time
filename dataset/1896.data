“See, it looks like the safest street in the city, but it’s actually the most dangerous if you happen to be smoking a joint.”

This is how Randy Credico sums up Gay Street, a quiet, one-block lane in Greenwich Village connecting Waverly Place and Christopher Street. People out for an evening in the Village often use the darkened block as a spot to surreptitiously smoke marijuana, he says, but the illusion of privacy is shattered by sirens and the swooping down of police officers.

Mr. Credico, 53, a stand-up comic and drug-law reform advocate, says he has been warning people constantly, and that the police in the area have in turn warned him that he is interfering in their arrests.

“The cops are always making arrests here, and so I tell people not to light up, that they’re going to get busted,” he said. “Since when is it a crime to tell people, ‘Listen, don’t break the law.’”

On June 12, Mr. Credico had his own run-in with law enforcement, after berating police officers making a pot arrest on Gay Street. According to the police, Mr. Credico used obscenities and yelled that that they should be “solving murders,” not making marijuana arrests. He was handcuffed and charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct and spent a night in the Manhattan Detention Complex, known as the Tombs. Mr. Credico called the arrest retaliation for his practice of warning pot smokers. (The arrest was widely reported, online and in New York newspapers.)

Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department’s deputy commissioner for public information, said in an e-mail message that Mr. Credico is “free to lobby for the legalization if he’s so inclined, but he may not interfere with police.”

At any rate, the arrest seems like the perfect culmination of Mr. Credico’s long crusade against Rockefeller drug laws in New York State, which are among the harshest in the nation, and he has been a longtime advocate for inmates serving sentences under them. He lives at 13 Gay Street, which was once the home of the late radical lawyer William Kunstler and is now the headquarters for the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, a legal aid service which Mr. Credico helps run, along with Mr. Kunstler’s widow, Margaret.

Mr. Credico said he generally supports the police, but he sees arrests for small amounts of marijuana as a waste of their resources. He said he has begun documenting what he sees as a misguided policy of drug enforcement, by taking photographs of plainclothes detectives arresting people for smoking or possessing marijuana. And he lurks outside city courthouses at lunchtime to try to take pictures of judges, prosecutors and detectives bringing in marijuana arrests. He plans to use the pictures to illustrate a comprehensive study to be posted online to prove his claim that the justice system is unfair, especially to people of color.

Much of Mr. Credico’s stand-up routine consists of his drug-law gripes. He says Mr. Kunstler taught him that publicity is perhaps his strongest weapon. Mr. Credico made headlines in October when he offered $25,000 of his own money to bail out Shawn Kovell, who was arrested on cocaine charges along with her boyfriend, Robert Chambers, “the preppy killer” who pleaded guilty to strangling Jennifer Levin during rough sex in Central Park two decades ago.

On Monday, Mr. Credico stood outside the courthouse at 100 Centre Street, dressed in jeans and a blazer and tie, he smoked a cigar and wielded a point-and-shoot camera. He paced in front of the courthouse, scouring the people walking out. The judges he could recognize from sitting in their courtrooms while they heard cases, he said. The prosecutors he could recognize because of their suits (and other attributes which he considers less unflattering). He also looked for detectives walking in people in handcuffs.

“Pretty easy to spot,” he said. “The cops are usually white and the perps are almost always people of color. They get them on measly, harmless marijuana arrests, which is the fuel they use to keep this factory of a criminal justice system going.”

He had an acquaintance nearby with a video camera to document things in case he got arrested again, he said.

Mr. Credico’s father served time in jail for safe-cracking and later owned nightclubs in California, where Mr. Credico grew up and began doing comedy and cocaine in back rooms with other entertainers. His played the circuit in Las Vegas and performed on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” at age 27. He was the subject of a documentary called “60 Spins Around the Sun,” financed by Jack Black, and was featured alongside Russell Simmons in “Lockdown, USA,” a documentary about the Rockefeller drug laws. He is the house comedian on the Albany radio show of Fred Dicker, a veteran New York Post reporter.

He jokes onstage that “Bloomberg” is Yiddish for “Giuliani,” and that narcotics agents in the city are truly undercover because “they leave their white sheets and hoods back on Long Island.”

Mr. Credico said his viewpoints were fostered by being around Mr. Kunstler, who remains his hero and is memorialized inside 13 Gay Street by photographs on the wall, along with images of other counterculture icons like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.

Mr. Credico met Mr. Kunstler, when an old sweetheart, the entertainer Joey Heatherton, faced criminal charges and needed a lawyer. Mr. Credico looked up Mr. Kunstler, who took the case pro bono and took on Mr. Credico as a friend.

As Mr. Credico sat in the Kunstler house explaining all this last Monday, the phone rang. He answered. It was an inmate with a drug case.

“Kunstler Fund.”

“Wait, where are you? Rikers?”

“So, it wasn’t yours? Why did you plead out? Oh, so you took the rap for your father then – I see. Yeah, I agree: A year and a half seems like a long sentence for a dime bag.”

“Listen, write your whole story up for me in a letter and send it to me, and I’ll see what I can do.”

Mr. Credico said that while spending his night in jail recently, most of the other detainees he spoke to said they had been arrested on marijuana charges. He said he turned down a settlement offer in his case — one day of community service — because he wants to bring the case to trial for the publicity – representing himself, of course.

In the meantime, he said, he would continue to take pictures of undercover police arresting pot smokers, and warning people about smoking pot on Gay Street.

“Listen, I don’t want people committing crimes on my street and I tell them not to,” Mr. Credico explained.
