As if the Mets do not already have enough problems, there is now some uncomfortable ambiguity surrounding the rotation as the team heads into three-game series at Atlanta and at Philadelphia.

Before Sunday’s 14-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Manager Jerry Manuel said he hoped to use the left-hander Hisanori Takahashi out of the bullpen during the trip, as he did in the week before the All-Star break. The Mets do not play Thursday, giving them the option of using a four-man rotation.

But Manuel said that plan was predicated on Niese’s pitching competently Sunday, which he did not (he gave up seven runs, six earned, and was removed with one out in the fifth inning).

After the game, Manuel backed away from the idea of skipping Takahashi in the rotation. He said that no decisions had been made, but he suggested that he might now be inclined to skip Niese in the rotation.

“I am a believer in skipping a young guy here or there just to keep him rejuvenated for the next start,” Manuel said.

That was news to the 23-year-old Niese. When told of Manuel’s comments a few minutes later, Niese said he was not aware that his skipping a start was something Manuel might consider.

Niese expressed no enthusiasm about the idea.

“I don’t want to skip a start,” he said flatly. “I want to be out there every five days. I feel good. So if I feel good, I want to be out there.”
