Buffalo Bills running back Thurman Thomas will not play in Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears.

Thomas, who has rushed for more than 100 yards in each of Buffalo's last three games, hurt his knee on Monday night against Denver and did not practice all week. He was designated as inactive by the team today and is thus ineligible to play.

Kenny Davis, who has started one game since coming to the Bills in 1989, will replace Thomas as the lone back in the team's one-back offense. Davis rushed for 45 yards after Thomas left the Broncos game.
