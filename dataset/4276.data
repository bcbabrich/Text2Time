To the Editor:

In raising understandable concerns about recent setbacks to enforcement of Voting Rights Act provisions to increase representation of minority voters, "Voting Rights Under Siege" (editorial, Feb. 16) presents a false choice: continued drawing of race-conscious legislative district lines that increase opportunities for minority voters to elect candidates of choice, or a return to the days when the voting power of minorities was diluted in majority white districts.

Both alternatives are anachronistic to those of us who believe we should simply strive to promote fair representation for all voters regardless of such subjectively defined criteria as one's race or where one lives. As the voters of Cambridge, Mass., Peoria, Ill., and several other American communities have discovered, there are ways to achieve this goal: modified at-large voting systems such as preference voting and cumulative voting.

Modified at-large systems are structured to allow more voters to elect candidates of choice without exercising any more voting power than other voters. Unlike race-conscious districts, they provide fair representation by allowing individual voters to define the representation they seek. Preference voting and cumulative voting are fully consistent with the principles of one person, one vote; they only break from American winner-take-all traditions by ending the unnecessary link of one vote per election contest.

By providing "universal coverage" for fair representation, these colorblind, partisan-blind voting systems are the best way for the United States to achieve consensus on insuring better representation of minorities -- and of majorities. Winner-take-all elections in single-member districts will never allow us to reach this consensus because they systematically and unavoidably deprive large numbers of voters of any realistic chance of helping to elect candidates of choice.
