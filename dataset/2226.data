The grisly death of real estate developer Andrew Kissel has gripped the wealthy community of Greenwich, Conn., where he lived, and brought back memories of the highly publicized death of his brother, who had been a prominent banker for Goldman Sachs and then Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.

In this weekâ€™s cover story, New York Magazine recounts the history of the Kissel family, offering a long and sordid tale of greed, lust and fraud.

The banker, Robert Kissel, was murdered by his wife. And early last month, his brother Andrew was found dead after being charged with fraud in three states. Recriminations continue among the surviving family members.

Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the story is the fate of the five children at the center of it all. As portrayed in the article, they were used as pawns in an ongoing game of petty squabbling among the adults they know best. Two of them lost one parent, while three lost a parent and saw another go to prison. One unknowingly fed her father narcotics in a milkshake so that her mother could bludgeon him to death.
