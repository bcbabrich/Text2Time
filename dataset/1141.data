Ryan Seacrest is on the verge of completing a new contract with NBCUniversal, the company that owns the E! channel, where he is a host and a producer; Bravo, where he is a supplier of programming; and NBC, where he will soon appear sometimes on the “Today” show.

He is likely to announce an expanded relationship with the company when he comes on “Today” on Tuesday morning. The appearance was teased on Sunday night by Jim Bell, the executive producer of “Today,” who wrote in a Twitter message, “Tuesday morning live on the TODAY show in Studio 1A, Ryan Seacrest will make a big NBC announcement.”

Mr. Bell followed up by wondering aloud on Twitter, would Mr. Seacrest “have more fun doing the weather for Al,” referring to Al Roker, “or having a cocktail in the 10am with Kathie Lee? What is your drink Ryan?”

Mr. Seacrest and his representatives have been negotiating for months with NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast, over a new package for him. Among its many pieces, some of which are not yet known, the package will include a coveted role for him on NBC’s coverage of the Olympics.

It will not place him on “Today” full-time, as has been speculated by some, but it will set him up for occasional contributions to the network morning show — potentially for “a few weeks a year,” according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations, who insisted on anonymity because of the confidential nature of the negotiations.

For Comcast, Mr. Seacrest already co-hosts and produces “E! News” and heads the channel’s red-carpet coverage at the Oscars. He will retain a significant role at E!, though maybe not as a daily news host.

Mr. Seacrest’s company also produces the E! channel’s multiple Kardashian shows and Bravo’s new reality show, “Shahs of Sunset.” Apart from Comcast, Mr. Seacrest also co-hosts the “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” special on ABC, hosts a weekday morning radio show for Clear Channel and hosts “American Idol” for Fox.

The new package with Comcast will not put Mr. Seacrest on “The Voice,” NBC’s new singing competition, despite the network’s rumored interest in having him take the helm of that show, a rival to “American Idol.” The owners of “Idol” are believed to be in separate negotiations with Mr. Seacrest for a new contract.

Mr. Bell’s Twitter message about Mr. Seacrest gained attention on Sunday night because “Today” is trying to blunt the competition this week from “Good Morning America,” its morning rival. “G.M.A.” has Katie Couric, a former co-host of “Today,” guest-hosting for a week.

A role on “Today” for Mr. Seacrest has been bandied about at least since last December, when he met with Mr. Bell and other NBC News executives. When the meeting was made public by The Wall Street Journal a day later, Mr. Seacrest was portrayed as a possible successor to Matt Lauer, the longtime co-host of “Today,” whose contract expires at the end of this year. But that possibility was more theoretical than real, at least in the short-term.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Seacrest declined to comment on Sunday night. A spokeswoman for “Today” did not respond to a request for comment.
