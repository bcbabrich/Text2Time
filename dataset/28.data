Widely considered one of the most important choreographers working today, Mr. Forsythe is a New Yorker who made his career in Europe. First in Stuttgart, Germany, then for two decades as director of Frankfurt Ballet, he took the genre in new directions by both ignoring and exploring its conventions — taking positions out of classical alignment; testing limits of balance, extension and strength; inventing strategies to generate movement; adding text, film and innovative lighting.

Even before Frankfurt Ballet closed in 2004, Mr. Forsythe had headed into more theatrical and improvisational terrain, which he would continue to investigate with the Forsythe Company, a smaller ensemble founded in 2005 . Two works created for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1999 were more or less his farewell to the extensions of balletic form that had put him on the map. Audiences craving more of the unblinking modernity that Mr. Forsythe had brought to classical dance had to content themselves with older works.

But Mr. Forsythe has come back to making ballet.

Since leaving the Forsythe Company in 2015 he has created two pieces (“Blake Works 1,” “Playlist [Track 1, 2]”) for ballet companies and one (“A Quiet Evening”) for a small group of his own longtime dancers — joyous, detailed riffs on ballet technique and tradition, danced to pop music, Rameau and in silence. (“Quiet Evening” will come to The Shed in New York in October.)

His new work for Boston Ballet, “Playlist (EP),” will be his first for a North American ballet company in almost 30 years. It shares a program with “Blake Works 1” and “Pas/Parts 2018,” a revised version of one of the 1999 Paris pieces. (His last North American commission, “Herman Schmerman,” created for New York City Ballet’s 1992 Diamond Project, was revived there this season and is currently being performed.)
