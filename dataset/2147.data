Hillary Rodham Clinton got a reminder in Iowa today of just how divisive the issue of immigration is –- on both sides of the ideological spectrum. She drew a lusty chorus of boos from advocates of laws permitting illegal immigrants to become citizens as she spoke at the Heartland Forum, a Democratic presidential forum organized by a collection of community groups here.

It happened as Mrs. Clinton was pressed on whether she was prepared, within the first 100 days of her presidency, to push through legislation that would give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. The question drew applause.

“I have been in favor of a path to citizenship for years,” Mrs. Clinton said, according to a transcript provided by Radio Iowa. “I voted it in the Senate and, as president, comprehensive immigration reform will be a high priority for me.”

She drew a scattering of applause but her questioner pressed Mrs. Clinton about whether she would do that in her first 100 days.

“You’ve got to get the Congress to pass the legislation,” she said, talking over boos from one corner of the room. “The president can do as much as possible, which I will do.”
