WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 (UPI)—At the request of Attorney General Griffin B. Bell, the Federal Bureau of Investigation director, Clarence M. Kelley agreed today to stay on the job until Feb. 15, when a new director’ is expected to take over.

Mr. Bell said that he hoped to have a successor confirmed by the Senate in the next few months.

The Carter Administration was forced to withdraw the nomination of Federal District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., who is suffering from ill health.

“It was most gracious of Mr. Kelley to delay his personal plans,” Mr. Bell said in a statement announcing Mr. Kelley's decision. “The bureau will continue to be well‐served under his leadership.”

Mr. Bell asked Mr. Kelley late yesterday if he could stay until mid‐February and Mr. Kelley promised to reply today.
