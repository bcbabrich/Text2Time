The TV trucks arrived at 5 a.m.

I’m back at federal Bankruptcy Court in Lower Manhattan, this time to cover the first day of General Motors‘ long-awaited first-day hearings. (You can also follow along on Twitter.) And to no one’s surprise, I’m not the only one with that bright idea.

When I first arrived a little after 11, it became readily apparent that the courthouse staff was well prepared for the blitz of observers who would arrive. The plaza in front of the Bankruptcy Court (in the same building as the National Museum of the American Indian) was neatly sectioned off by metal barriers, cordoning off pits for the expected throngs of photographers and video camera crews.

And a small cadre of police and security officers were on hand to enforce order, though none seemed particularly tense.

By 1 p.m., a half-dozen spectators had grabbed seats in Room 623. That actually isn’t the customary courtroom for Judge Robert E. Gerber, who was assigned to handle the G.M. case, but that of Chief Judge Burton Lifland. Judge Gerber happens to have the smallest courtroom of all the bankruptcy judges in Manhattan, a chamber roughly half the size of Judge Lifland’s, whose much more spacious courtroom holds just under 100 people.

Within the hour, however, the benches in the room quickly accumulated occupants. Assorted items — file folders stamped with law firm names, papers bearing the CNBC logo, various coats and jackets — sat sentry for future occupants. So too did dozens of young adults, too fresh-faced to be anything but seat-warmers of one kind or another.

(For what it’s worth, the overflow room where I’ve camped out during the Chrysler hearings is far from packed. About a dozen folks are gathered here, pecking away at their laptops.)

By 3:30 p.m., it was hard not to navigate through the hallways without running into clumps of dark-suited lawyers striding down the hallway toward Judge Lifland’s courtroom, which had become standing room only. Younger associates were easy to spot: they were the ones wheeling along cartons of documents.

The hearing on Monday promises to be rather mundane, concerned with typical first-day motions like payments to critical vendors and other concerns needed to keep the lights at G.M. on. The action should heat up when more controversial motions, like the proposed 363 sale, get under way.
