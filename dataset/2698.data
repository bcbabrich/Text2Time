To the Editor:

Verlyn Klinkenborg's Editorial Observer about H. L. Mencken (''Remembering the Permanent Opposition of H. L. Mencken,'' Dec. 30) made me reflect on how outrage serves our democracy.

Senator Trent Lott's record on race has finally raised the ire of the Republican Party. But Senator Bill Frist shows that a sexist may still wander where racists fear to tread.

Mr. Frist's opposition to sex education, international family planning and emergency contraception demonstrates an attitude toward women that also deserves a vehement outcry. The discrimination against women still practiced by the Augusta National Golf Club, which didn't admit a black member until 1990, suggests that misogyny may have even deeper roots than racism.

I hope that I live long enough to see insensitivity to women by our leaders get the anger it deserves.
