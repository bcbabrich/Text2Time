On a mild day in March, a stroller in Vienna's Volksgarten (People's Garden) notices that the ravens are suddenly missing from their posts in the trees. Their departure to Russia anticipates the end of the gloomy Danubian winter. Because of the ravens, some Viennese birdwatchers prefer to visit this small park in winter, but given its central location, the Volksgarten is truly a park for all hours and seasons.

Built in the 1820's on the spot where Napoleon's retreating army removed a fortification from the city's glacis, the Volksgarten is refined as parks go, holding nature at a distance. The grass is off-limits, but visitors can walk along the maze of paths, admiring the rose garden, examining the neoclassical Temple of Theseus and pausing at the monument to the beloved Empress Elisabeth, who was assassinated in 1898 in Geneva. In one corner is a small, octagon-shaped pavilion where coffee and cake are served outside once the weather is predictably nice.

Opening off the Volksgarten, and spatially part of it, is the Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square), from which one can look onto the greatest panorama in all Vienna: the Burgtheater, a corner of the neo-Renaissance University, the neo-Gothic steeple of the Rathaus (City Hall), the racing chariots atop the Parliament and, straight ahead, the domes of the Fine Arts and Natural History museums. On the Heldenplatz you can lie in the large tracts of grass among the lilac bushes and wonder at how much sky is visible from the center of a city.
