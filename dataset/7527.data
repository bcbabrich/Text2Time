HOUSTON, Nov. 30 — The baseball franchise of Richmond in the International League was sold today to Toledo, Ohio, but the team will continue to operate as the leading minor‐league affiliate of the New York Yankees.

The sale, announced at the annual meetings of the major and minor leagues, will bring Toledo back into the high minor leagues after an absence of 10 years. The club had played in the American Association as the Mudhens and then the Glass Sox until 1954.

The team at Richmond had been owned by the Yankees untill two years ago, when it was bought by Romeo Champagne, a supermarket executive from Manchester, N. H. Last season it played to only 148,000 persons, continuing a decline that had started about three years ago.

Champagne sold the franchise to the Lucas County Recreation Commission in Ohio for a price that was reported to be between $90,000 and $100,000.
