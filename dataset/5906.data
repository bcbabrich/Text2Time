Agreement was reached last night for six cable television companies to bring service to Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. The Board of Estimate voted unanimously last night to approve the franchises, and no significant changes were made from the terms that were reached a week ago.

''Substantively,'' said Morris Tarshis, the city director of franchises, ''it's the same.'' He said the contracts should be signed the week of July 18 and the first wires should be laid this fall in a process that, the agreement says, should see the boroughs outside Manhattan completely wired within seven years. Pleas on Minority Hiring

Executives of the companies said last night they would heed pleas that members of racial minority groups be equitably represented in hiring.

''We want a fair share,'' said Robert Munoz of the Citywide Coalition of Community Construction Workers. Officials of the companies - American Cablevision, Cablevision Systems, Cox Cable, Queens Inner Unity Cable, Vision Cable and Warner Amex -promised they would meet those pleas.
