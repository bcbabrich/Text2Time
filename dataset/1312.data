SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — I just don’t understand some people. If someone you know happens to be a practicing physician, wouldn’t you think that the last thing they’d encourage you to consume is a crunchy, sticky treat? And yet, that’s just what Mark Diehl does today. Shame on you, Dr. Diehl. And you call yourself a dentist.

It’s so worth it, too. I will confess that I used to be afraid of Saturday puzzles but this one, while challenging, seems friendly. The entries are fabulous, a veritable time line of pop culture from mid-20th century right up through the video game generation’s The Legend of ZELDA. They’re not so hard to get that I couldn’t successfully leap to a new sector after I had gotten the previous one to fall. The crossing 15s are wonderful.

And, oh, the wordplay. Today’s puzzle had enough clever misdirection to keep me very happy. It might frustrate some people, but I admire a well-turned clue. Take 4 Down. RUES is a word we see a lot in crosswords, and it’s usually clued in terms of regret. Not today. “Ways of Charles de Gaulle” is the kind of clue that gives me a double frisson: first, when I realize that I don’t know anything about the man de Gaulle, especially nothing that is four letters long and will really have to think differently about what I’m seeing; second, when I finally fill it in, perhaps from the crossings, and that smack-yourself-in-the-forehead feeling kicks in when I realize that I’ve been had. Good times.

It’s the same with “Cab alternative.” Ever try to hail a taxi in New York City during rush hour? It’s impossible. I’ve seen taxicabs virtually vaporize into thin air when they see someone with their hand out. An alternative, maybe a metered magic carpet, would be nice. But is Dr. Diehl really talking about a taxicab here? No, he is not. Pour yourself a glass of ZIN and ponder that one for a while.

I’d never heard of a RAKEHELL, but I like the word. Similarly, most of American Bandstand’s run took place before my time: did Dick Clark ever refer to his audience as TEENERS?

Still, a masterful example of what a Saturday puzzle should be. I’m going to go brush my teeth.
