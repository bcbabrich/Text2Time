Dow Loses 47.33 Points; Technology Sector Is Weak

Alan Greenspan spoke on Wednesday, and the bears are still listening. Since Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned of ''excessive optimism'' in the financial markets, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 160 points, or 2.3 percent. The slump continued yesterday, as the Dow fell 47.33 points, to close at 6,877.74. The technology sector -- in particular, shares of computer networking companies -- remained weak, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 3.66 points, to 1,309.

For the week, the Nasdaq index was down nearly 2 percent. The Dow's loss for the week, however, was only 54 points after strong gains on Monday and Tuesday. $(Page 38.$)

Treasury prices were little changed despite lingering worries that the Fed would soon raise short-term interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was 6.80 percent, unchanged from Thursday, but up from 6.64 percent a week ago. $(38.$)

Creditors Dislike Offer for Barney's

The creditors committee for Barney's Inc., the New York retailer, decided in less than 24 hours that a $240 million cash bid by Dickson Concepts (International), a Hong Kong-based retailing company, was unacceptably low, people close to the situation said. Other interested parties, notably Saks and Neiman Marcus, would not comment, but the creditors committee's first option is to see if either of them will raise the ante. $(36.$)
