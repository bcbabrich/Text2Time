Can a man approaching the age of 50 still credibly stand on a stage, strip naked and perform songs with titles like “Wheelchair Epidemic”? Audiences will soon find out as the Jesus Lizard, the provocative and unpredictable Chicago rock ‘n’ roll band, has announced it is reuniting, Billboard reported. Founded in 1987 by the yelping vocalist David Yow, 48, the band became as famous for studio albums recorded by Steve Albini as for live shows in which Mr. Yow would expose his genitals to the crowd for entire songs, or entire sets. Mr. Yow plans to perform with his bandmates Duane Denison, David Wm. Sims and Mac McNeilly at an All Tomorrow’s Parties festival in Minehead, England, in May, and in the United States in the following months.
