Mike Tyson dispatches his opponents so quickly that one of the country's major cable operators has offered an unusual discount to pay-per-view fight fans who have cried foul after shelling out $39.95 or more.

If Tyson, 30, dispatches the 34-year-old Evander Holyfield -- or vice versa -- in Round 1 of their bout on Nov. 9, subscribers will pay only $9.95. But for every round the bout goes beyond that, there will be an additional $9.95 charge, up to a maximum of $49.95 if it lasts until the fifth or beyond.

The arrangement was proposed yesterday by Jim Dolan, the head of Cablevision, which is in 2.8 million of this country's 60 million households that are wired for cable television. He said that the pricing gimmick was a way to deal with people who were resentful over fights lasting less than a round. ''We wanted to correct that,'' Dolan said.

But officials in Las Vegas, Nev., where the bout will be, expressed concern that the arrangement could affect the credibility of the bout, which would generate more money for Cablevision the longer it lasts.
