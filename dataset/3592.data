DR. ROBERT G. NEWMAN moved through the crowded halls of Beth Israel Medical Center at 16th Street and First Avenue last Tuesday morning, shaking hands and slapping backs like a politician. He wanted to see how his staff was adjusting to Beth Israel's recent partnership with St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

''There is inevitably a certain amount of uncertainty with all of the changes around here,'' said Dr. Newman, who is the president of the newly combined hospitals.

At first glance, Dr. Newman would appear to be another buttoned-down chief executive of a large hospital, in this case one of New York City's three largest hospital systems. But he is a maverick who, while not quite estranged from the medical establishment, has raised more than a few eyebrows in the last 25 years.

He was an early champion of the use of methadone to ease withdrawal symptoms for heroin addicts, leading some to call him ''the methadone pope.'' He advocated needle exchange programs long before AIDS brought them to the forefront of debate. He honored do-not-resuscitate requests for the dying in the fledgling days of the patients' rights movement. He broke from the ranks of hospital administrators to cut his own deals with unions. And most recently, he has established a clinic that caters to lesbians.
