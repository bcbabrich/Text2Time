To the Editor:

Your Sept. 18 front-page report that the Bush Administration has tied loan guarantees for Israel to a settlements freeze in the Israeli-occupied territories gives the impression that the United States has always adhered to the position that Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are illegal. That is not so. There was a time when the United States didn't even hold to the position that settlements are an obstacle to peace.

The Carter Administration held that the settlements were illegal. It backed this view with a solid legal brief prepared by the State Department legal adviser, Herbert Hansell. The department reiterated this position regularly, in particular whenever the Israelis put in a new settlement. This did not stop Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Likud Government from creating new settlements, but it had some deterrent effect.

But in the fall of 1980, in the heat of the Presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan announced that he, unlike his opponent, definitely did not consider Israeli settlements in the occupied territories illegal. After Mr. Reagan took office, my colleagues and I in the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs devised a formula we hoped would accommodate the new President's position while making known to the Israeli Government that the United States still disapproved of settlements.

The formula said essentially: "the matter of legality aside, settlements are an obstacle to progress toward peace." It was given to one of Mr. Reagan's top foreign-policy people. He read it and answered, "Even if I agreed with this, which I don't, I wouldn't show it to the President."
