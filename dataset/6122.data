PARIS, Nov. 2—The Government of President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing has reinforced the French garrison in Senegal in West Africa in an attempt to bolster France's diplomatic efforts to win the release of eight of its citizens kidnapped by guerrillas in neighboring Mauritania.

Last night about 300 troops and some reconnaissance aircraft were flown to Senegal to join the garrison near Dakar. According to Defense Ministry sources, the new arrivals raise to about 1,500 the number of French troops stationed in Senegal and specially equipped for emergency operations in Africa.

By ostentatiously reinforcing the garrison, French officials said tonight, the Government wants to show that it regards the abduction of six French technicians at the Mauritanian mining center of Zouerate in May and two more in the area last week as essentially the same as the taking of hostages by airliner hijackers. It is believed that the eight are being held at scattered camps by guerrillas of the Polisario Front, who are fighting for the independence of the formers Spanish Sahara, now divided between Mauritania and Morocco.

The French Government hopes that the troop movements will add weight to diplomatic efforts that have already been employed, such as sending envoys to Algeria, the Polisario Front's principal supporter, to ask that that country use its influence with the guerrillas to win the prisoners’ release.
