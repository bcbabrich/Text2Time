Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Define various parts of the components of microprocessors and how they are interrelated.

2. Examine how the miniaturization of computer chips affects the amount of silicon used to insulate them and how this relates to the end that is in sight for silicon transistors used in chips by reading and discussing “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip.”

3. Understand Moore’s Law, focusing both on the relationship between time and the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit and the relationship between time and the cost of new microchip technology.

4. Draw connections between Moore’s law to the information provided in featured article.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-copies of “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

NOTE TO TEACHERS: This lesson plan assumes that students are already familiar with how computer chips work.

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: On a piece of paper, each student defines the following terms based on their current knowledge: microprocessor, integrated circuit, chip, transistor, semiconductor material, and digital circuit. Students then share their definitions, and review how these components are interrelated.

2. As a class, read and discuss “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why is silicon dioxide “nearing the end of its usefulness as a main component of microchips”?

b. Why must the layer of silicon dioxide on computer chips become increasingly thinner as chips get smaller?

c. How did scientists discover “that the silicon dioxide layer needed to be four or five atoms thick to act as an insulator”? What will happen when the layer of silicon dioxide is too thin?

d. Why are computer chips becoming smaller?

e. What other techniques are in experimental stages so that there can be a viable replacement for the present transistors? What are the benefits and drawbacks of these techniques?

f. What examples can you think of that support Dr. Isaac’s statement in the last paragraph that “history has shown that if something can be done, someone will find a way to do it”?

3. Explain Moore’s Law to students, focusing both on the relationship between time and the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit and the relationship between time and the cost of new microchip technology. (Intel co-founder Gordon Moore observed in 1965 that each new computer chip is released approximately every 18 months with double the data density as the previous chip.) Many Web sites provide excellent explanations of Moore’s Law, including Intel’s Microprocessor Hall of Fame (//www.intercast.de/intel/museum/25anniv/hof/moore.html) and More on Moore’s Law (//www.eco.utexas.edu/undergraduate/Forum/ML/index1.htm). Be sure to emphasize that though Moore’s Law is referred to as a law, it is really a prediction.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In their journals, students respond to the following question: How does Moore’s law relate to the New York Times article “A Stay of Execution For the Silicon Chip”? Students should use specific details from the article to support their reasoning. Students may also conduct further research on Moore’s Law and its predictions for the future of the silicon chip.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What items in your home and school have microprocessors?

–How do microprocessors work?

–Why do computer chips continue to get smaller?

–What is the importance of computers in your life?

–How has computer technology changed the world in the past fifty years?

–How do you anticipate computers changing the world in the next fifty years?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on a review of the function of the components of a computer chip, participation in class discussion, and written journal entry that demonstrates understanding of Moore’s Law and how it applies to silicon chips.

Vocabulary:

transistor, absolute, viable, insulator, semiconductor, electrons, atom, quantum, theoretical, optimistic, miniaturization, contaminate, capacitor, electrostatic, nanotechnology, implementing

Extension Activities:

1. Create a “How It Works” poster about microprocessors or integrated circuits.

2. Design a handout for your classmates about Rock’s Law and Parkinson’s Law of Data, defining these two “laws” and how they relate to Moore’s Law.

3. Learn about nanotechnology and other atomic innovations that could affect how atoms are manipulated and the possible outcomes.

4. Create a computer jargon guide, including commonly used computer terms such as bits, bytes, RAM, and ROM.

5. Write a biography about Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel and the creator of Moore’s Law.

6. Develop an illustrated timeline tracing the history of computers and their capacities.

7. Visit the Web sites of various computer companies, such as Intel, Lucent, I.B.M., Apple, and Sun. What are the missions of each of these companies? For what advancements in technology is each company responsible? What advancements do these companies envision for the future?
