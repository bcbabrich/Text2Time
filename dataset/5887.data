President Reagan has signed legislation that will allow companies to seek Federal reimbursement for more than $50 million in losses suffered after the Government banned Tris, a flame retardant that many companies had used to meet Federal safety standards for children's pajamas.

The legislation, signed Thursday, has been approved by Congress twice in four years. President Carter vetoed it in 1978, contending that it was an unprecedented ''bailout'' for manufacturers of defective products.

The new law will aid companies that treated sleepwear with Tris to meet flammability standards set by the Department of Commerce for 1971 and 1974. The companies had to dispose of vast quantities of clothing in 1977, when the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned Tris after it was found to cause cancer in animals. Tris is chemist's shorthand for No. 2, No. 3-dibromopropyl phosphate. a flame-retardant compound.

The legislation was shepherded through Congress by Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina. He said Thursday that he was ''pleased and gratified that the bill was signed.'' He added, ''It will help make amends for a great wrong suffered by the textile industy, which acted in good faith to comply with law.'' No Amounts Are Set
