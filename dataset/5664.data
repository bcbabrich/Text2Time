Eastern Airlines chairman, Frank Borman, told employees today that he was extending the airline's yearlong wage giveback plan because Eastern could not afford the $22 million a month it would cost to reinstate salaries.

The plan was to expire at midnight, but Mr. Borman said in a company- wide letter that the 18 percent to 22 percent pay cuts negotiated with Eastern's 37,000 employees in December 1983 would be continued until a new agreement was reached.

Eastern made a profit in the third quarter, but lost $41 million in the first 11 months of 1984. It has not made an annual profit since 1979.

''Until the negotiation process is exhausted and a new wage and productivity plan is in place, wages and salaries established for all employees will remain at the level set by the 1984 Wage Investment Program,'' Mr. Borman said.
