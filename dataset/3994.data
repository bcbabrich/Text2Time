Whatever occurred during a late-night confrontation between two rival casino executives on May 4, it wasn't a crime, a municipal judge ruled yesterday, dismissing a complaint by Edward M. Tracy that Nicholas L. Ribis had threatened his life. Mr. Ribis, who runs the Trump casino operations in Atlantic City, had denied making any threat and said he merely asked Mr. Tracy to leave a restaurant at the Taj Mahal casino. Mr. Tracy, who now works for another casino company, was Mr. Ribis's predecessor as the chief executive of the Trump casinos. JOE SHARKEY
