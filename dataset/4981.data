Despite the threat of a veto from President Bush, the House overwhelmingly voted today for changes in the troubled Federal Housing Administration insurance program, which has been losing $4 billion a year because of bad loans.

The vote, 418 to 2, amended a comprehensive housing bill that the House is expected to approve Wednesday. That bill would authorize about $28 billion for the Government's housing programs for the fiscal year 1991.

A Bigger Down Payment

It would establish new programs to help first-time home buyers, allow people receiving housing assistance to buy their homes and encourage production of new rental housing.

The Administration says the House bill is too costly, and it supports a provision in a bill passed by the Senate that would require that those who receive F.H.A. mortgages to make a bigger down payment than they do now. The theory is that those who put up more money will be less likely to default on their mortgages.
