This Martina II, with a radiant smile, is lithe at 5 feet 4 inches. Manufacturers are already donating equipment to her. Keretic says she may play in the junior competition at the United States Open in August, which would be her first trip ever to the United States. And she can play.

The young player, who is right-handed with a two-handed backhand, was introduced to grass last Thursday by her mother, who is also her coach. Today, Hingis beat Tzu-Ting Weng of Taipei, 7-5, 6-3, after her rather undeveloped service was broken three times in the first set. Hingis beat the larger player, a day short of her 15th birthday, with lobs and drops, but also with strong forehands and a growing comfort in going to the net.

"It's much better how she wins the matches," said Keretic, a former West German Davis Cup and tour player based in Hamburg. "Normally, the all-round player takes longer to develop. She plays everything. She can stay back and she can force the pace." Doesn't Mind Back Courts

During a short interview, translated by Eva Keretic, the New York-born wife of the manager, Hingis said she liked playing on grass at the back courts of Wimbledon.

"I've played in front of large crowds, but here the people are interested in Agassi and Sampras and the others," said Hingis, who actually has drawn large crowds of curious fans.

The young player will soon return to the small village of Trubbach, where her mother is married to a Swiss businessman. Mother and daughter left Czechoslovakia four years ago. Hingis is said to be an A student and likes horseback riding and swimming.

Most people who interview her voice concern that her childhood will be cut short by the pro tour.

"At 14, I will decide whether to turn pro," she said. "I will travel more then. It won't be the same, but we are determined to be home as much as possible."
