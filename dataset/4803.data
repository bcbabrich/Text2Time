Here are the dates by which the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, the President and Congress are expected to act on base closings: July 1: The commission sends its recommendations to the President.

July 15: Deadline for the President to either accept the list, reject it or return it to the commission for revision. If he rejects it, the process stops. If he returns it, the commission has four more weeks to revise the list to satisfy the White House. Once the President approves the list, he sends it to Congress, which has 45 legislative days to reject it, or it takes effect. Congress cannot modify the list. If Congress rejects the plan, no bases will be closed. Aug. 15: Deadline for the commission to submit a new report, if the President disapproves the first one. Sept. 1: Deadline for the President to approve a revised commission report. If the President disapproves, no bases will be closed. If he approves, he sends it to Congress for action.
