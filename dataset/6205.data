Calling on New York City to “face the facts,” Senator James L. Buckley yesterday recommended voluntary bankruptcy as the best course of action it could pursue now. In a policy statement on the city, Mr, Buckley contended that appointment of a Federal court trustee was the best way of guaranteeing continuation of vital services, reordering the city's debt and relieving fiscal pressure on the state.

The state's Conservative‐Republican Senator charged that the plan of Governor Carey and Mayor Beame for a special Federal guarantee of credit for the city to avoid default was mere “face‐saving” that would help creditors and officials who had mismanaged the city but not benefit the ordinary city, dweller.

“There is only one thing that can defeat this city and it is a failure to face the facts,” Mr. Buckley declared at a news conference at his office at 110 East 45th Street.

Political Motive Denied

While the Senator's policy appeared to parallel closely that of President Ford's, Mr. Buckley drew distinctions. And in response to questioning, he said his motive was unrelated to his own budding re‐election drive and to speculation that the Senator might have difficulties with what is perceived in some New York circles as the harsh tone of Mr. Ford.
