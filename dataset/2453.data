Richard Karz's documentary "9/11/03: A Day in the Life of New York," filmed entirely on the second anniversary of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, intercuts clips from events occurring around New York City that day with scenes from a formal dinner and discussion that night in the landmark Surrogate's Courthouse. The discussion, which focused on the aftermath of the attacks, was moderated by John Sexton, president of New York University, and attended by news media, business and government leaders ranging from the hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons to the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense, Paul McHale, and the New York City police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly.

If this sounds like a lot of V.I.P.'s for a documentary that claims to be about everyday life in New York, sit tight: before the film is over, we will also accompany the humble, quotidian wanderings of the Rev. Al Sharpton, Joe Torre and Salman Rushdie, among others. Several lengthy segments are also devoted to Drew Nieporent, the owner of Nobu, TriBeCa Grill and several other high-end New York restaurants; as it happens, Mr. Nieporent is also responsible for catering the dinner around which the film is centered.

Mr. Karz's single-minded focus on the lives of the power elite is so striking that the viewer almost begins to wonder if the film's subjects paid for the privilege of appearing in this group backscratching session. In one recurring narrative, the executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate shows a multimillion-dollar high-rise property to a young woman representing the rap star P. Diddy (known, as of last week, as simply "Diddy"). How this transaction relates to the aftermath of 9/11 is unclear, but it does give the broker a chance to wax philosophical about the ups and downs of New York real estate, while the director sneaks in some breathtaking views of the city.

Not all of "9/11/03" concerns the housing tribulations of the super-rich: the film's best segment accompanies Isaiah Owens, a Harlem funeral director, as he discusses his lifelong fascination with burials and describes the process of preparing a body for open-coffin viewing. For a moment, the film seems poised to open onto a little-seen and fascinating corner of city life. But, unfortunately, this clip (like two others devoted to the daily lives of Christopher Rising and Larry Serras, New York City police officers) lasts only a few minutes, and then it's back to the Surrogate's Courthouse for some stiff dinner conversation.
