To the Editor:

It is difficult to understand why the basis of our protests against United States Surgical Corporation is consistently misreported (news story, March 3). The company operates on live dogs in hundreds of sales demonstrations to promote use of its surgical staplers to doctors. Board-certified surgeons are trained in all wound-closure methods. United States Surgical is not a medical school; it is a commercial enterprise that kills dogs to make sales. That has nothing to do with surgical training. It has everything to do with animal abuse.

More to the point would be a report on our efforts and legal actions to have the company's Connecticut lab license revoked so that this vivisection for profit can be stopped. The case is now on appeal, and the truth may soon be recognized as expert opinion is brought to bear.

Yes, there are larger issues involved, but none larger than the cutting up and killing of dogs for corporate profits. PRISCILLA FERAL President, Friends of Animals Norwalk, Conn., March 7, 1989
