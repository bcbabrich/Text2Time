The University of Pittsburgh fired Coach Mike Haywood on Saturday in the wake of his arrest on a charge of domestic battery in Indiana against the mother of his child. Pittsburgh hired Haywood, who was the coach at Miami (Ohio), on Dec. 16 to replace Dave Wannstedt.

Pittsburgh Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said in a statement that the decision “reflects a strong belief that moving forward with Mr. Haywood as our head coach is not possible under the existing circumstances.” The university said that Haywood had been informed of the decision Saturday afternoon.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported that Haywood was released from St. Joseph County Jail on Saturday afternoon after posting bond. He told the newspaper in a telephone interview: “It isn’t fair. The truth will eventually come out.”

The firing and its aftermath are likely to place significant pressure on Athletic Director Steve Pederson, who hired Haywood and praised him at the time by saying, “Most importantly, Michael is a man of character and integrity.”

When Pederson was the athletic director at Nebraska, he hired Bill Callahan as the Cornhuskers’ football coach. After four seasons, Nebraska fired Callahan after he compiled a 27-22 record — an unacceptable mark at a university that expects to compete for national championships. Pederson himself was fired by Nebraska in 2007, shortly before Callahan was dismissed.

In his first major move since returning to Pittsburgh, where he had been the athletic director before taking the Nebraska job, Pederson essentially forced Wannstedt to resign under pressure. After a long list of potential candidates — including Houston’s Kevin Sumlin, Tulsa’s Todd Graham and Iowa State’s Paul Rhoads — refused to even discuss the job, there was a strong perception among college football officials and observers that Pitt did not have a plan after forcing out Wannstedt.

Now, with about half the university’s football recruits wavering or rescinding their commitments, Pederson needs to fix a program in disarray.
