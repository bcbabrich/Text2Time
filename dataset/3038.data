AT the close of George W. Bush's news conference after the Republican sweep of Congress last month, a reporter asked what the president had given his wife for their 25th anniversary, Nov. 5, which the couple celebrated at the White House. Mr. Bush, who was by then out of camera range, responded with a lascivious wink, prompting startled laughter from reporters who had no trouble figuring out what he meant.

Nothing so remotely risqu√© occurs in ''George and Laura,'' a largely respectful rehash of familiar tales. As cut and pasted by Christopher Andersen, the author of other tell-all political-couple books, the story of the Bush marriage has neither fireworks nor glamour. What he depicts is an attraction of opposites based on love and commitment -- admirable, to be sure, but not especially interesting or revealing.

Andersen, who interviewed Mrs. Bush's mother but not the couple themselves, presses a well-worn theme: hard-drinking goofball living in famous father's shadow marries shy librarian, whose inner steel helps him beat back alcohol, Ann Richards and Al Gore. Perhaps that is the theme because that is the truth, but Andersen takes no trouble to offer us new insights or, in fact, much of anything new at all. Most of the information here has already been reported in newspapers, magazines and other biographies, which would be acceptable if Andersen provided more than just a general list of sources for his chapters. He lifts quotations from other publications, which makes it seem as if he conducted the interviews, and confuses this reader, at least, about whether he himself dug up the few new nuggets he offers.

It was Mrs. Bush, Andersen asserts, who first came up with the idea of Dick Cheney as Mr. Bush's running mate. ''So why not pick Dick?'' Andersen quotes her as blurting out in the summer of 2000, when Cheney was in Texas overseeing the vice-presidential search. Since Andersen was presumably not sitting around the barbecue with them, it would be good to know where this comes from. In another anecdote, sourced to one of Laura's ''closest friends,'' Andersen has Mrs. Bush telling her husband late one night in the kitchen that he has to stop drinking or else -- and then writes that Mr. Bush ''rose slowly, ambled over to the kitchen counter -- and poured himself another bourbon.'' Later, Andersen quotes an unnamed confidante of Mrs. Bush as saying that ''Laura was concerned that the stress of being president might start him to drinking again.''
