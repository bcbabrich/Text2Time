WASHINGTON – It was Senator Barack Obama who crossed the aisle.

As the senators gathered to vote on the $700 billion financial rescue package on Wednesday evening, Mr. Obama walked over to the Republican side of the chamber to extend a greeting to Senator John McCain.

He got a chilly response.

While it took Mr. Obama several seconds to make his way over to see his rival, Mr. McCain barely pivoted his body as he took Mr. Obama’s hand for a handshake that lasted just a moment. The eye contact was just as brief.

The moment provided a rare element of drama in an otherwise routine evening of votes. It was a curious sight on Capitol Hill, marking the second time in less than a week that the two presidential candidates crossed paths in Washington over deliberations on the economic relief package intended to stabilize the nation’s financial system.



Mr. Obama, who first arrived on the Senate floor at 5 p.m., presented his argument in favor of the legislation in a 13-minute speech. When Mr. McCain arrived shortly before 8 p.m., he did not join other Republicans in addressing the Senate. Aides to Mr. McCain said he had already addressed the substance of the bill during a speech earlier in the day in Missouri.

As Mr. Obama worked the floor of the Senate, holding a long conversation with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and walking around to greet a host of other colleagues, Mr. McCain largely stayed near his seat. Republican senators wandered by to say hello, before he walked away from the chamber.

The legislation passed by a wide margin, with spectators looking on from crowded galleries as the senators voted from their desks, a procedure that is reserved as a formality on pieces of legislation that are carefully watched.

The two men each returned to the campaign trail about 9:30 p.m., with Mr. Obama setting off on a late-night flight to Michigan and Mr. McCain spending the night in Washington.

Their next scheduled meeting? Next Tuesday at their second presidential debate.
