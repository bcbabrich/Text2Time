The chairman of an important Congressional subcommittee is drafting a proposal to expand Medicare to cover millions of people who lack insurance, as an alternative to President Clinton's health care plan.

Under the proposal, devised by Representative Pete Stark, chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, the Government would collect premiums from consumers and employers through the Internal Revenue Service. The proposal would give most Americans the option of enrolling in the new expanded Medicare program or in a private health insurance plan.

Mr. Stark said he intended to use his proposal as a basis for negotiation when his panel begins drafting health legislation next week. He briefed White House officials about the proposal on Friday and is trying to round up support on his subcommittee.

There is no guarantee that the proposal, the opening shot in what is likely to be a yearlong Congressional battle over health legislation, will be approved by Mr. Stark's subcommittee, much less by the full Ways and Means Committee, the House or the Senate. But Mr. Stark is in a strong position to push for the ideas in his proposal. Goals Are Shared
