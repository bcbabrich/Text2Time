A Premiere of Rorem Songs Turns Out to Be Chamber Music Alice Tully Hall

The premiere of Ned Rorem's "Songs of Sadness" had its proper setting on Sunday evening. At first glance eight songs with accompaniment, this was really chamber music as played by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. In Mr. Rorem's brief cycle, guitar, clarinet and cello are, if not equal partners, at least important friends to the vocal part.

In "How Can I Sing," flurries of arpeggios from the clarinet offer back-and-forth dialogue with the singer's leaping intervals. "A Vision of the Garden" is vigorous syncopation. In "Strike, Churl," a bleak wind blows in chromatic movement. A long cello solo introduces "A Mother's Lament."

Two of the songs are gentle dances, while "Binsley Poplars" matches the gray despair and inner rhythms of Gerard Manley Hopkins's text. The songs are bound together, sometimes by solo interludes. Kurt Ollmann was the excellent baritone, David Shifrin the clarinetist, Sharon Isbin the guitarist and Fred Sherry the cellist.

There was other music: a Trio Sonata in E by C. P. E. Bach, strangely soporific for such a volatile composer; Gounod's delightful "Petite Symphonie" for nine winds, in which the organ-grinder's art is raised to new esthetic heights, and finally Mozart's dark and precisely played C-minor Serenade. The first-rate players were Ransom Wilson, Stephen Taylor, Allan Vogel, Larry Combs, Julie Feves, Milan Turkovic, David Jolley, Robert Routch, Edgar Meyer and John Gibbons. BERNARD HOLLAND
