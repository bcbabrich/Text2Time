The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, announced yesterday that it had agreed to purchase over the next year about $2 billion in home mortgages orginated by the Sears Mortgage Corporation, a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company.

Fannie Mae said that under the agreement it would purchase fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages from Sears, either with cash or through the exchange of Fannie Mae's mortgage-backed securities. The mortgages that Sears will deliver to Fannie Mae will include some seasoned mortgages that Sears has held.

Earlier this week, Fannie Mae also made an arrangement to buy a similar amount of mortgages orginated by Norwest Mortgage Inc., Des Moines, the mortgage-banking subsidiary of the Norwest Corporation, Minneapolis.
