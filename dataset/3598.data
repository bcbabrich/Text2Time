Re ''Consulting: Don't Lose It, Improve It'' (Viewpoint, Jan. 4), by Thomas J. Waite:

As a management consultant with more than 30 years' experience, I agree with many of Mr. Waite's points about how to find effective consultants instead of the fee seekers, and wish to add a couple of my own.

* Avoid consultants whose primary -- and sometimes only -- approach to helping a troubled enterprise is a rush to technology. A consulting team often does not have any real understanding of the client's business -- including its organization, personnel, processes, management strengths, products, competition and markets. And it frequently is not interested in or incapable of developing the required understanding of the processes to which the new technology will apply. Indeed, the consulting budget often does not even provide time for this crucial task.

* Choose a consultant who is willing to ask unpopular and unsettling questions, and to recommend actions that challenge the principles and assumptions on which the business is and has been operated. Bringing the client bad news is part of many projects. It takes courage and integrity on the part of the consultant, and requires sensitivity as well as good communication skills, developed only from experience.
