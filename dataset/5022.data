The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, stung by sharply lower steel prices and higher operating costs, said yesterday that its third-quarter net income dropped 78 percent. Bethlehem, the nation's second-largest steel company, also said the level of shipments dropped 6 percent for the quarter.

Bethlehem, like other leading steel makers, was hurt by the widespread price discounting in the industry in the quarter, as previously announced price increases failed to stick.

The company reported net income of $10.1 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with $46.9 million, or 53 cents a share, in the 1989 period. Sales for the quarter declined 4.7 percent, to $1.21 billion, from $1.27 billion. The third quarter of 1989 included $105 million in charges for restructuring and reducing the size of two of its operations.

While price discounting has affected the earnings of several other steel companies, Bethlehem has been particularly vulnerable because it has few operations outside of steel. Also, Bethlehem is the only big producer that has no joint ventures with foreign steel companies. Underlying Problems
