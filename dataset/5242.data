Precious metals futures soared yesterday after a dramatic late rally caused frenzied buying among the large number of traders who had been betting on a decline in the prices of gold, silver and especially platinum in recent weeks.

At the close, the unrestricted spot March platinum futures were up $25.30 an ounce, to $475, while the more active April delivery rose the daily limit of $25, also to $475.

Experts said the late surge in platinum largely reflected rising concern about the political situation in South Africa, a major producer of the metal. 'A Wild Scene'
