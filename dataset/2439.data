Atkins Nutritionals, the former heavyweight champion of the low-carb diet business, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday.

The filing is the latest attempt to salvage a troubled company. Once a high-flier with surging sales, Atkins faltered as the diet fad it helped create started to wane and sales of low-carbohydrate products slowed in the second half of last year.

An Atkins spokesman, Richard Rothstein, said the company, which is privately held, had worked out agreements with a majority of its lenders that would give them equity in exchange for a reduction in debt. Mr. Rothstein said the company was seeking the bankruptcy court's approval for this plan and hoped to emerge from bankruptcy "before the end of the year."

A hearing is scheduled for today in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.

As it faced sagging consumer demand and a marketplace glutted with low-carb products last year, the company's operations quickly foundered, making it difficult for it to keep up with its loan obligations. Since late 2003, Atkins has been saddled with roughly $300 million of debt from a deal in which Goldman Sachs and Parthenon Capital, a private equity firm, bought a majority stake.
