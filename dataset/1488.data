Introduced on Thursday: 2011 Subaru WRX STI sedan

Is it real? Travis Pastrana wannabes rejoice: The wing is back! Just when enthusiasts thought that continual upgrades to the “regular” WRX sedan (including its own boy-racer wide-body treatment) would negate the STI’s raison d’être, Subaru renews its commitment to clandestine street racers everywhere with this addition to its ultimate-performance model line (which includes also a five-door hatch).

What they said: “The continuous evolution and development of the WRX STI is driven by the strong, loyal and vocal support from thousands of enthusiastic owners of this exciting high-performance vehicle,” said Tom Doll, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Subaru of America. “The 2011 four-door WRX STI will expand the appeal of this iconic performance model to a wider range of driving enthusiasts.”

What they didn’t say: Does Subaru expect that “wider range of driving enthusiasts” to include golfers? Well, please note the luggage compartment in the WRX STI will accommodate three golf bags. Who buys a WRX for golf? You buy them — and embarrass Golfs.

What makes it tick? The 2011 WRX STI sedan, as well the hatch that has been the only other STI body style offered since a 2008 redesign, will offer a high-boost 305-horsepower turbocharged/intercooled 4-cylinder Boxer engine mated to a 6-speed manual. To maximize handling – beyond the improvements Subaru says it has made to the system over all for this model – the driver can select among “Intelligent,” “Sport” and “Sport Sharp” automatic driving modes; and there’s a manual mode with six driver-selectable differential locking settings. (Use responsibly.) Rocket fuel recommended.

How much? How soon? A base price around $35,000 is expected when it goes on sale this summer, just in time for tire-melting season.

How does it look? These things aren’t meant to look pretty, are they? Good thing, because in everyday driving, the new picnic table/rear spoiler would look, um, juvenile. The imitation rally racer (Subaru no longer competes in the WRX World Rally Championship) wide-body panels and the new 18-inch wheels and tires complete the out-of-its-element look.
