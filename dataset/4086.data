On the barren stage of the Liberty, which looks bombed-out, Ms. Shaw is illuminated by only a few unshaded light bulbs and the artfully placed spotlight. The image she creates is mesmerizing, as is her fluid control of her slightly husky voice.

The performance is mesmerizing, but is this really Eliot? And, for that matter, can such a piece work as theater? Or should it? I think not, but that's no excuse not to make the attempt. There is something about the communal nature of theater that contradicts the spirit of Eliot's isolating, hallucinatory, often impenetrable visions and his densely packed allusions to Shakespeare, Milton, Virgil, Sophocles, Verlaine, the myth of the Grail and, well, you name it.

''The Waste Land'' is to be read at one's own speed, often haltingly, as one stops, goes back and starts again, in this way to gather momentum to make the next leap from the vividly particular to the abstract and apocalyptic. Unless you're a don, there's no other way to obtain a purchase on this most complex of modern masterpieces.

If you accept these limitations, and if you read the text first, this ''Waste Land'' is something to which you can pay attention without feeling that you have failed it. You certainly should pay attention to Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner. For some time now, they have been stirring up the London theater scene with a succession of celebrated and/or controversial productions, including a ''Richard II'' in which Ms. Shaw played the title role, and Samuel Beckett's ''Footfalls,'' which so outraged the Beckett estate that attempts were made to close it.

Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner take their work seriously.

'The Rehearsal'

There are some very good things in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of ''The Rehearsal,'' the witty, tartly sentimental Jean Anouilh comedy, first produced here in 1963 and now being seen in a fine new English translation by Jeremy Sams. He is the man responsible for the English version of Jean Cocteau's ''Indiscretions'' (better known as ''Les Parents Terribles'') produced on Broadway two seasons ago. Though ''The Rehearsal'' lacks the roaring humor and rue of Anouilh's ''Waltz of the Toreadors,'' it is an exceptionally satisfying work. This production, directed by Nicholas Martin, has beauty, style, humor and the most cohesive acting ensemble to appear at the Roundabout in some time.

''The Rehearsal'' belongs to that group of Anouilh plays in which the artificiality of theater is compared to the artificiality of real life. The setting is post-World War II France and a chateau where some all too sophisticated aristocrats are putting on a production of Marivaux's 1723 classic, ''La Double Inconstance'' (''The Inconstant Lovers''), whose tale of innocence betrayed parallels the story of the contemporary play. If you happened to see the splendid Comedie-Francaise production of the Marivaux at the Brooklyn Academy of Music earlier this year, your pleasure will be enhanced.

The victim of ''The Rehearsal'' is Lucile (Anna Gunn), a sweet, unspoiled young woman, governess to the orphans who are housed in one of the chateau's more remote wings. The Count (David Threlfall), being bored by both his wife, the Countess (Frances Conroy), and his mistress, Hortensia (Kathryn Meisle), casts them in supporting roles and asks the governess to play Sylvie, Marivaux's heroine, who is somewhat more resilient and believable than Lucile.
