The Diallo killing, in which the officers stand charged with second-degree murder, set off months of demonstrations in which the police were accused of trampling civil rights in their zeal to curb crime. Many critics said they were particularly upset by what they described as indiscriminate and routine searches in minority neighborhoods.

The most basic finding of Mr. Spitzer's study was that blacks were stopped six times more often than whites. Hispanics were stopped four times more often, the report said.

Blacks, for example, made up 25 percent of the city population but 50 percent of the people stopped. Whites, by comparison, made up 43 percent of the population but were stopped only 13 percent of the time.

Police officials have long contended that the disparity was based on the fact that most people are stopped in poor, high-crime neighborhoods, many of which have a majority of black and Hispanic residents. But the attorney general's analysis found that, even when the statistics were adjusted to take higher crime rates among minorities into account, the number of blacks and Hispanics stopped still far exceeded the number of whites stopped.

Citywide, the study found that, after adjusting for different crime rates among racial groups, Hispanics were stopped 39 percent more often than whites. Blacks were stopped 23 percent more often, the study said.

To arrive at those percentages, the analysts compared how often members of a particular race were stopped to how often they were arrested. The analysis found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped at a rate that was much higher than the rate at which they were arrested. The rate at which whites were stopped was only slightly higher than the rate at which they were arrested.

For example, there were 1.5 stops of blacks for every black arrested, but 1.2 stops of whites for every white arrested. Analysts calculated that blacks were stopped 23 percent more often than whites. In the category of violent crime, officials said the disparity was even more stark. For example, the study said, blacks were stopped as suspects in violent crimes twice as often as whites, even after adjusting for the difference in arrest rates between the two races.
