Elyse Fischer, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Articulate their understanding of the framers’ intentions with respect to the separation of church and state as these men wrote the Constitution and created the American government.

2. Explore the issue of church/state separation and how it is currently manifesting itself in Ohio by reading and discussing “Holy Cow! Ohio Has A Motto Problem.”

3. Examine other church/state issues and their resolution through research and discussion.

4. Synthesize and reflect upon the issue by creating a poster and writing an essay.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-paper

-copies of “Holy Cow! Ohio Has a Motto Problem” (one per student)

-classroom reference materials (encyclopedias, history textbooks, reference books on the United States, computers with Internet access)

-large pieces of poster board or construction paper for posters

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): What is meant by the “separation of Church and State”? Why did the framers of the Constitution deem the separation of church and state so important when creating the Constitution? Do you think it is as important in the United States today?

2. As a class read and discuss “Holy Cow! Ohio Has a Motto Problem,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What is a motto?

b. Why do states or localities have mottos?

c. How do you think the author of the article, Jane Fritsch, chose her title?

d. Why did the United States Court of Appeals rule that “With God, All Things Are Possible” cannot be used as the motto for the state of Ohio?

e. Why is a quotation from the New Testament considered Christian?

f. Why can the federal government use “In God We Trust” as a slogan when Ohio can’t use “With God, All Things Are Possible”?

g. How did the “skirmish” over the separation of church and state begin in regards to the Ohio state motto?

h. According to the Ohio State Historical Society, why was the motto “Imperium in Imperio” or “An Empire Within An Empire” rejected in 1866?

i. Also, according to the article, why did Ohio’s 1959 slogan “languish” until George Voinovich returned from a trip to India? What did he see in India that prompted him to initiate a new use of the old motto?

j. What was the initial federal ruling about the motto?

k. What is an appeals court?

l. Why did the American Civil Liberties Union (A.C.L.U.) appeal the initial decision?

m. Why does the length of the Court’s opinion suggest that it was a difficult decision for the justices to make?

n. The article cites instances in which the courts approved of the presence of the word God in government activities. Give some examples.

o. How did the state of Ohio argue against the A.C.L.U’s contention that the quotation constitutes an “endorsement” of the Christian religion?

p. According to the author, how will the State of Ohio respond to the ruling?

q. From the tone of the article, do you think that Jane Fritsch has an opinion about the Court’s ruling?

3. Divide students into five groups. Assign each group one of the following scenarios: a group of students wishes to form a Bible Study club or a prayer club in school; a state legislates that parents can use state funded vouchers or get tax credit for sending their children to religious based parochial schools; an elementary school, City Hall or the local courthouse is decorated for Christmas with a tree and a nativity scene; the coach of a football team leads the team in prayer before a game; the state funds an aide to help a deaf student get through his or her day, and the student goes to a private, religious school. In their groups, students should discuss how their scenario might be considered a church/state issue. Students should then research one example of the issue using the following questions as guidelines (written on the board for easier student access):

-Why is this considered a church/state separation issue?

-What similar court case pertained to the scenario?

-Who were the “key players” in the case?

-How did the Court decide?

-What was the basis of the Court’s opinion?

4. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK: Working in their groups, students create a poster documenting their research. Students should be encouraged to make their posters visually interesting by incorporating photographs and drawings into their text. Individually, students should write an opinion piece about their assigned scenario. Students share their work at a later date.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Should mottos change as a population changes?

–Is it appropriate for the United States to use “In God We Trust” as a slogan? Support your answer.

–Separation of church and state issues are very contentious. Why?

–What other issues do you think people feel equally as passionately about?

–Are there church/state issues in your own community? How are they handled?

–Why do institutions create mottos?

–Do you think that use of a motto from the New Testament is appropriate for a state in the United States? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and group discussions and thoughtful participation in research and poster creation.

Vocabulary:

seal, motto, slogan, skirmish, pretentious, feudal, salvation, invoke, divine, humility, affinity, overt, unconstitutional, appeal

Extension Activities:

1. Create a motto for your school or community. Take into account the people who live or work there, whether there is a unified belief system, the presence of minority points of view, and how the motto will be used while creating the motto.

2. Research the “Establishment Clause” of the Constitution? Who was responsible for including the Establishment Clause in the first amendment? (Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the

freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a

redress of grievances.) Why did the Framers include it? Create a poster or report about the first amendment, paying particular attention to the establishment clause and its history.

3. Create a timeline with important Supreme Court decisions that have addressed the issue of separation of church and state. How did the Supreme Court’s opinions evolve over time? Are there trends?

4. Research the motto of your state. What are its origins? Do you think it should be changed? If you believe it should be changed, write a letter proposing a new motto to your state legislature. Outline your arguments against the old motto and suggest a replacement.

5. The article mentions that the State of Ohio is sure to appeal the Federal Ruling. How does the appeals process work? Describe the appeals process in a report or on a poster.

6. What is the American Civil Liberties Union? Contact your local branch of the A.C.L.U. for primary source material. Do research on the A.C.L.U. on the Internet. What kinds of cases is the A.C.L.U. usually involved with? What have they been involved with in your state?

7. Many states have official state anthems, birds, flowers, and even official state cookies. Research state symbols. Create a chart noting the symbols of different states.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts – The “Star Spangled Banner” is the national anthem. Do you think it is an appropriate anthem for the United States? Research the history of the “Star Spangled Banner.” Make an argument for a contemporary alternative to the anthem.



Foreign Language – Many states, localities, universities etc. have mottos that come from Latin, Greek or Hebrew. (For example, E pluribus Unum – “Out of Many, One”, is found on the Great Seal of the United States.) Why do you think these languages are so common? Find some examples of these mottos. What do they mean in translation.

Geography – Make a map of the United States, incorporating all of the mottos of the states. Postulate on why you think certain states chose certain models. Research and find out whether your answers come close to the reasons given in text.

Global History – Find examples of countries that have an official, state-sanctioned religion, examples of countries that have a clear separation between church and state and examples of countries that have governments that have made clear disavowals of religion. Create a chart or table, comparing and contrasting different aspects of these nations. For instance, what type of government is in place in these countries? Are there laws protecting religious or ethnic minorities? Is the law of the land secular or religious or a combination of the two? Are there differences between and among categories? (i.e. Some nations with institutionalized religion might ascribe to secular laws, some might not.)

Media Studies – If you received all of your information about the United States from what you saw in television and in the movies, what would you believe to be the dominant American attitude toward God and religion? Make a journal of your television and movie experiences over the next week. Is there evidence of the America being portrayed by the mainstream media as having a particular attitude toward God and religion?

Science – Scientists often struggle with seeming contradictions between faith and science. (The theory of evolution is a good example.) Why might some scientists have this struggle?

Teaching With The Times – How has the Times covered church/state issues? Using an example from the lesson, trace the Times coverage of one particular issue as it relates to church/state issues.
