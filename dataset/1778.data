To the Editor:

Re “Christopher Wheeldon, Unbowed” by Roslyn Sulcas [Oct. 25]:

In her feature on Christopher Wheeldon, Ms. Sulcas suggests that “the health of the dance scene and the cultural world in New York” may be in jeopardy if Wheeldon “can’t attract the financing and support for his work.”

Surely not. Dance is presently enjoying unprecedented acceptance as one of the necessary fibers of our culture. If taken seriously, Mr. Wheeldon’s comment that ballet need not be “a big, puffy, pink, glittery nightmare” is insulting to his colleagues and his forbears.
