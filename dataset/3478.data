It is also the parents' job to be sure their children are physically suited for the camp activities. Too often, the precamp medical examination is treated as a bothersome formality. Why, many parents wonder, do healthy children have to be checked out before engaging in activities they are likely to enjoy at other times of the year as well?

For one thing, the precamp physical is an opportunity to have a child's health thoroughly assessed. For another, children at camp may push themselves or be goaded to go beyond their bodily limits when engaging in physically demanding group activities.

Camp personnel should always be alerted to the recent or current health problems of children in their charge. These might include recent illnesses, injuries or operations; allergies and especially food allergies, which can be life-threatening, chronic health problems like asthma or diabetes and any physical limitations or disabilities. Parents must also be sure to give permission to camp personnel to provide emergency medical care, if needed, if the parents cannot immediately be reached.

Parents can consult the camping association's Web site, which has a section that includes suggested questions to ask camp directors, guidance on choosing a camp and a list of accredited camps. The site is: www.acacamps.org

What to Check

Be sure the camp is accredited, but do not assume a camp is safe even if it is accredited or if a parent or child previously attended it or worked there. Ask to see the camp's written safety plan, which must be filed with the state or county health department and which describes staff qualifications and training, camper supervision, safety requirements for specific activities and fire safety and medical requirements.

Ask how the staff is screened and trained. Are prospective counselors checked for driving and criminal records and previous employment history? Are their swimming skills tested? Do counselors undergo a precamp training program (usually for six days) that includes safety instruction and must they pass a test? Are all counselors at least 18, and is the median age of counselors 21 or more, as recommended by the camping association? What is the camper-to-staff ratio? The younger the children, the fewer campers should be in each counselor's charge.

What percentage of counselors are trained and certified in CPR or first aid? What arrangement does the camp have for medical care, both on site and off?
