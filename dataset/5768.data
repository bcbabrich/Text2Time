As fire and smoke filled Grand Central Terminal Wednesday morning, a major concern among fire officials was the potential for PCB contamination from burning electrical transformers.

The Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Company 1 was called with the first alarm at 5:30 A.M. to monitor the situation and check for other chemical dangers.

PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenlys, were used as coolants in electrical transformers before the Federal Government banned them in 1977. Many transformers in utility power circuits and electrified railway cars built before the ban, however, still contain the substance. At high temperatures it becomes a cancer-causing agent that can be spread by smoke and soot.

Firefighters of the HazMat unit, as the company is known, were among the first to enter Wednesday's blaze, which swept through 18 decrepit rail cars left in an underground storage yard.
