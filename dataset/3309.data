The small, immaculately catered luncheon that drew President Clinton to a stately home here today was billed as a benefit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But the anticipated recipient of much of the more than $1 million raised was the candidate who may have the least need for donations and the president's fund-raising help: Jon S. Corzine.

Mr. Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire who broke all records in spending nearly $35 million on his primary race, has been a boon to Democratic candidates across the country, because he has made heavy contributors out of wealthy friends in New Jersey and New York who were previously uninvolved in politics. Many were here today.

Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the chairman of the fund-raising committee, who has begun to take a more direct hand in guiding Mr. Corzine's campaign as well, missed the event because of a vote in Washington on aid to Colombia.

But more than 40 people did show up, paying at least $20,000 apiece, in addition to about a dozen local politicians. Among those who dined on medallions of poached Maine lobster tail under a backyard tent were former executives at Goldman, Sachs & Company, where Mr. Corzine was co-chairman until he resigned last year, and other investment firms.
