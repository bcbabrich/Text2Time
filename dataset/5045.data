To close the $882 million budget gap forecast for next year's 1989-90 budget, Democrats, who control both the House of Representatives and the Senate, are expected to call for limited growth in government spending and to raise additional funds through increases in alcohol and tobacco taxes, user fees, the state's tax on interest and dividend income as well as bridge and highway tolls. They may also move to remove exemptions to the state's 7.5 percent sales tax.

The co-chairmen of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee, Senator Joseph H. Harper Jr., Democrat of New Britain, and Representative Paul Gionfriddo, Democrat of Middletown, have sent a letter to other lawmakers warning that the focus of the budget would be ''to maintain essential services and nothing else.'' The words ''essential'' and nothing else'' were underlined.

But Republicans are expected to oppose tax increases and instead push for an outright freeze on state spending and hiring, as well as the reallocation of some appropriations made for the current fiscal year.

One often-cited example of reallocating or cutting expenditures is to reduce the $93 million paid to consultants this year. ''They are everywhere,'' said Representative Robert G. Jaekle, the House minority leader, a Republican from Stratford.

The financing requested by all state departments would bring the state's 1989-90 budget to about $7.1 billion. Because of labor agreements, some mandatory expenditures and other built-in costs, a zero-growth budget is not fiscally feasible. Commissioners believe a 12 percent increase in the current budget is needed to keep services at the present level.

Neither party believes that it is politically practical to institute a state income tax at this time. Mr. O'Neill, a Democrat, has also indicated that his budget, to be sent to the General Assembly in early February, would probably not include layoffs among the state's 44,200 employees. Parties Blame Each Other

Anthony V. Milano, the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, has attributed the projected deficits for both the current and next fiscal years to overly optimistic projections of sales tax revenue and a drop in corporation tax collections resulting from the Federal tax overhaul.
