According to David Weinstein, president of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center, a nonprofit group aimed at helping emerging entrepreneurs, Mr. Avakian is an example of the successful "lifestyle" entrepreneur. As opposed to the high-growth entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, he says, lifestyle entrepreneurs are content to stay small, focused and profitable rather than rushing forward seeking growth regardless of the inevitable red ink and risky financing.

"Lifestyle types are driven, not by mega-growth, but by quality of service and by providing a meaningful service or product to a community," Mr. Weinstein said.

Though Mr. Avakian has his sights set on a significant national campaign someday, Mr. Weinstein, who has advised Argot Tea, is impressed by the discipline Mr. Avakian has demonstrated with his start-up. "They are growing within their community, getting established within each community and not trying to launch 100 stores at once," he said.

They are also tapping into a deepening well of discontent with the big chain stores, with their crowded aisles, impersonal service and, in the case of Wal-Mart, a perception that workers are not well treated. "I hate malls and I hate Wal-Mart," said Upton Bell, a radio and television commentator in Cambridge, Mass., who prefers to shop at local family-run stores like Cambridge Naturals, a natural-products and supplements outlet. "Each day, it seems that we have less and less control of our lives, so it's important to me to have a place where everybody knows my name and I know I'm not being conned."

Perhaps he is being a bit harsh on the chains. After all, they provide the little guys with a steady stream of dissatisfied customers. And they are not necessarily the predators they are made out to be. Rather than decimate the independent coffee shops in Main Street America, for example, the popularity of Starbucks apparently swelled their ranks. According to the Specialty Coffee Association of America, as the Starbucks chain grew from 55 outlets in 1989 to 8,500 last year, the number of independent coffee shops in the United States increased to 10,000 from 521.

"It was Starbucks that raised the awareness and interest," said Paul Comi, president of Caffe d'Amore in Pasedena, Calif., a $22 million supplier to independent coffee shops.

For Michael Kanter and Elizabeth Stagl, who are married and co-owners of Cambridge Naturals, staying small is a choice they have made for the 31 years they have operated in Cambridge. Though there have been numerous chances to open additional stores in the Boston area, the couple has stayed put in their Massachusetts Avenue location, just north of Harvard Square. During that time, they have seen dozens of competitors in the area come and go. Today, there are three Whole Foods supermarkets within two miles of the store, along with a Wild Oats and a Harvest Co-op within three miles. In Harvard Square, just six blocks away, are two more competitors of similar size. Yet Cambridge Naturals thrives and turns a comfortable profit for its owners.

"We live in an isolated and lonely culture," Mr. Kanter said. "When you ask people what is missing from their lives, it isn't a big-box store. People stop into our store for the social interaction as well as the products. We're an oasis."
