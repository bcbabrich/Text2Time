The French police opened a criminal investigation today to determine whether a chase by seven photographers on motorcycles was responsible for the car crash here that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, and her companion, the Harrods heir Emad Mohammed al-Fayed, shortly after midnight. This evening, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne and Diana's husband until their marriage ended in divorce a year ago, flew here from Scotland and sadly accepted her body, in a plain wooden coffin, from President Jacques Chirac at Pitie-Salpetriere university hospital, near the Sorbonne.

With Diana's two sisters, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Charles then flew back to a shocked and grieving Britain with the body.

The police did not identify the photographers except by their nationalities, six French and one Macedonian, all said to be commercial freelance photographers working on commission for photographic agencies. After questioning them all night, the authorities placed all seven in formal detention, which allows them to be held for 48 hours without charges. The police were said to have seized several rolls of their film.

''The inquiry will establish in more detail the role that these people may have played in the cause of the accident and how they behaved at the site,'' a statement by the Paris prosecutor's office said.
