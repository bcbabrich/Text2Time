Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Examine the definition of community service, as well as determine the needs of people in their community and what types of service a student can offer.

2. Analyze the steps in planning and executing a fundraiser through reading and discussing “Banking on Super Bowl To Help Feed the Hungry.”

3. Brainstorm what a group would need to do to organize a fundraising project such as the one discussed in the article.

4. Develop basic plans, in small groups, for fundraising projects that they could actually organize and execute.

Resources / Materials:

-paper

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-student journals

-“Banking on Super Bowl To Help Feed the Hungry” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: In the first five minutes of class, each student responds to the following (written on the board prior to class) on a piece of paper:

–What is community service?

–What types of people in need of community service exist in your community?

–What types of service can a person your age offer as an act of giving to a person who is in need in some way?

Students then share and discuss their responses, and the teacher writes them on the board.

2. Read and discuss “Banking on Super Bowl To Help Feed the Hungry,” focusing on the following questions:

a. How did the Souper Bowl service project originate?

b. How has the Souper Bowl project spread to other cities and states?

c. What basic materials do students involved in the Souper Bowl project need to make their fundraising efforts successful?

d. How does this fundraiser meet the needs of the communities in which it is held?

e. What does Brad Smith mean when he says, “We can acknowledge that football transcends many things in our society, and we can use that for good”?

f. What makes the Souper Bowl project a simple fundraising project in which to participate?

g. What other national events or holidays have service projects tied to them (e.g., Toys for Tots and Christmas)? Why are these big events useful in encouraging people to give money, items, and time to those in need?

h. What benefits might be gained by a fundraising organization in obtaining sponsorship from corporations or spokespeople?

3. As a class, discuss what a group would need to do to organize a fundraising project such as the one discussed in the article, keeping in mind the Souper Bowl Sunday project and the student responses from the initial class procedure. The teacher should write ideas on the board in preparation for the next procedure.

4. Tell students that they will be developing a basic plan for a fundraising project that they could actually organize and execute. Students divide into small groups of three or four. Each group decides upon a yearly event (such as a holiday, a national or local yearly event tied to a season, sports, tradition, and so on) to which the service project can be tied. Then, each group begins planning a service project by responding to the following questions:

–Who will be the recipients of your project’s funds, and what needs does this group of people have that can be met by the funds you raise?

–How will you raise money for these recipients (e.g., selling flowers, bake sale, washing cars, sponsoring a dance-a-thon)? Be creative!

–What adults will need to help you with this project, and how?

–What other students will need to help you with this project, and how?

–Where will this fundraiser be held, and why is this location a good choice?

–What materials would you need for this project (what you will be selling, as well as other equipment such as a table or posters explaining the project)?

–How and where will you advertise this project?

–What is the name of your fundraiser? (Must tie into the event and the type of service provided.)

Students present their fundraising project plans to the class. Students may vote on the project they like best as a class fundraising project.

5. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: In their journals, students respond to the following questions: Why is it important to care about others in your community who are in some type of need? How have you helped someone in your community, and how did it make you feel? Students can share their answers in a future class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is the definition of “community service”?

–In what ways can people give of themselves to others?

–What types of acts do you consider to be “charitable”?

–What types of service can a person your age offer as an act of giving to a person who is in need in some way?

–How was the Souper Bowl project originally started, and how has it evolved since its inception?

–What steps are involved in planning a service project?

–What national events or holidays have service projects tied to them, and why are these big events useful in encouraging people to give money, items, and time to those in need?

–In what service or fundraising projects is your school involved?

–How could a person go about getting involved in a community service project or other charitable project?

–What is the importance of fundraising in our society?

–What experiences have you had in participating in community service?

–What types of everyday acts of giving do you perform?

–How does performing acts of giving or good deeds for others make you feel?

Extension Activities:

1. Create an informational poster about a specific service organization (the Internet is a great place to do your searching). When, where, and why was the organization founded? Who was the founder? What services did the organization originally provide, and what does the organization do now?

2. Locate charitable organizations in your community. How do the needs met by these organizations reflect the needs of your community? What organizations do you think need to be developed, and why?

3. Research a local or national fundraising project. How and when did the project begin, and how has it grown since then?

4. Write letters to large businesses in your community asking about the types of community service or fundraising projects in which they are involved.

5. Visit a soup kitchen, food bank, homeless shelter, or other location in which you can donate your time to help someone in need.

6. Write a reflective essay defining “community” and “service” and discussing reasons why people should offer service to members of their community. Include your personal experiences with community service and charitable acts in your writing.

7. Research a charitable organization and write a newspaper article discussing the history of the organization, special projects in which this organization is involved, and ways in which a person can get involved in this organization.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Write a biography of a person who started or is extremely involved in a charitable organization in the United States. How did he or she become involved? What in his or her background influenced this person to be so involved?

Fine Arts- Create posters or other creative displays portraying the act of giving to others.

Global History

-Research international organizations created to offer money and other types of aid to countries worldwide. How is this organization run? What is the history of the organization? In what international situations has this organization assisted?

-Learn about how the idea of charity is demonstrated in other cultures.

Mathematics- Find out about the ways in which money obtained by charities is used. Compare the monies that are used for administrative costs to the monies that go directly to people or to services. Create a pie chart or other type of graph illustrating your findings.

Media Studies- Find examples of advertisements and other appeals for donations from various organizations in newspapers, magazines, on television, and on the radio. How do these organizations discuss the notion of giving to others? For what, according to the advertisements, will the donated money be used? What persuasive tactics are used in the advertisements?

Teaching with The Times

-Select a New York Times article from the national or international section that you feel either exemplifies the idea of charity and service or discusses a person or persons who you would categorize as someone in need. Write about the article, reflecting on the notions of giving and receiving charity in this specific instance.

-Find articles or other pieces of writing about charities and fundraising events in The Times (or in your local newspaper). What section of the newspaper did you find these articles, and why? Try to find such an article in each section of the newspaper.
