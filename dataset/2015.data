Lara Stone isn’t your typical runway android. She walks like Lurch and you can’t tell from her stunned expression if she’s going to burst into tears or belt you in the chops. But we love her. She’s 23, Dutch, and she has a little gap between her front teeth.

“They say in French that it’s good luck,” Stone told me last night in the Givenchy backstage. She’s had a lucky year. Overlooked until Riccardo Tisci put her in his Givenchy couture shows, Stone has a big Bardot-like spread in this month’s Paris Vogue; she gets the cover (in Chloé) for April. “Sometimes a girl just touches you,” Carine Roitfeld, the magazine’s editor, said. As for Stone’s awkward gait, the explanation is almost too dopey for words. She wears a size 7 shoe — and runway shoes are at least a size larger. “They made me my own special shoes,” Stone said at Givenchy. “I’m so happy.”

I asked the photographer Greg Kessler to keep a record of Stone: one girl, one season. Here she is in every show since New York.
