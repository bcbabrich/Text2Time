Employees of two copper companies have approved new contracts that cut their wages 20 percent, and talks continued at two other companies, Kennecott and Inspiration Consolidated Copper.

At a fifth company, Asarco, 1,650 workers will work without a contract and vote Wednesday on a tentative contract, according to Edgar Ball, negotiator for the unions.

The 3,100 union workers at Newmont Mining Corporation's Magma and Pinto Valley Copper Companies approved a new contract Sunday, Mr. Ball said.
