Of all the questions surrounding the case of Joel Rifkin, who is accused of killing 17 women, the first quandary prosecutors must resolve is this: Who will get the first crack at convicting him?

Legal experts say the case is a jurisdictional morass involving nine counties in the New York region, since the authorities have said Mr. Rifkin killed most of the women in Manhattan and dumped their bodies in rivers and woods in a wide area from eastern Suffolk County to northern Putnam County. The state police are coordinating the murder investigations, but a month after Mr. Rifkin's arrest, a squadron of prosecutors is still trying to resolve where he will be tried and in what order to bring the cases.

Prosecutors say they want to make sure that the first case tried is the strongest, since an acquittal in the first trial could weaken all the other cases. It is also important that they gain more than one conviction, they say, to make it virtually certain that Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, will never be paroled. Lure of Praise and Publicity

And, of course, the prosecutor who wins the first case against Mr. Rifkin will reap the greatest windfall of praise and publicity. While none will say so publicly, the prosecutors themselves admit that they are extremely reluctant to yield authority in high-profile cases in which a conviction is certain to burnish their reputations.
