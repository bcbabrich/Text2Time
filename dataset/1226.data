“Eden as We Recall,” a delicate work by Stacy Spence, is a dance about space: What does a room feel like? What influence does the environment have on the body? At Danspace Project, where the piece was performed as part of its Platform 2012: Judson Now series, Mr. Spence excavated St. Mark’s Church with his movement and with his eyes.

Elements were arranged on the stage with deliberation. A screen showed an image of two doorways side by side. Audio equipment sat on the floor near four white benches that lined the area directly in front of the audience. On one side of the benches were spools of white and orange string, masking tape, keys and paper; on the other Mr. Spence sat with his back to us.

Even before the dance started, Mr. Spence’s barely-there movements — crossing a leg, adjusting the position of an upturned palm, shifting the weight of a hip — were unmistakable. It helped that the lighting design, by Carol Mullins, kept the space perpetually bright and that Mr. Spence is all skin and bones. A longtime member of the Trisha Brown Dance Company, he can shift from brittle to fluid at a moment’s notice.

Of Mr. Spence’s collaborators, the sound artist Tei Blow and the dancer Brandi Norton (another Trisha Brown alum), Mr. Blow is the more compelling. Using a microphone and a recording device, he created a score by plucking string, ripping paper or brushing the microphone along Mr. Spence’s body and then playing it back. “Eden as We Recall,” which most likely refers to Eden’s Expressway, the scrappy SoHo studio where the piece was first conceived, becomes as much about sound as about space.

The details you normally gloss over — the way a wall juts out or ordinary background noise — are brought to the forefront in “Eden.” Mr. Spence caressed the air as if he were touching objects even when there was nothing there, but he also moved brashly, whipping into a sudden attitude turn with a raised bent knee, or flinging himself into the air with outstretched arms.

Still, as compelling as Mr. Spence is — and such advanced articulation of the body is always weirdly titillating — “Eden” has its fair share of dullness. Ms. Norton’s appearance midway through came like an afterthought. At its heart “Eden” is a sensory trip for two.
