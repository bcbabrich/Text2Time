Berman insisted he would favor the division series even if ESPN were not showing it. ''I've been sold on it from talking to players and managers,'' he said. ''This offers more good than bad for a sport that needs oomph.''

Costas can easily tap into his personal encyclopedia of wild-card nightmares. His ability to weave baseball-has-maimed-itself scenarios has not endeared him to his bosses or baseball. Last year, executives at The Baseball Network, the joint venture of NBC, ABC and Major League Baseball, hoped that he would clam up during his broadcasts. He did not.

''It mystifies me to hear people say that this has somehow improved baseball,'' he said. ''I guess that's true if you're willing to trade the potential of the genuine high-end drama of a real pennant race for a few cheap, bottom-end, wild-card thrills.''

The Dodgers-Padres game on Sunday fueled Costas's arguments: if the game truly meant that the losing team would be out of the playoffs, the Dodgers surely would have used their starting pitcher, Ramon Martinez, for more than a one-inning, spring-training-like tuneup for his division series start.

''I keep hearing that all the objections to this format come from purists, as if the only ones who aren't turning cartwheels over it are baseball's version of the Amish people,'' he said. ''I have no problem with realigning the divisions or expanding the playoffs as long as it's done in a thoughtful manner. This was done with no thought at all.''

Costas said that what separated baseball from other sports was the meaning of the regular season, where finishing first, not with enough victories for a playoff spot, meant something. ''Too many teams make the N.B.A. playoffs,'' said Costas, the host of NBC's National Basketball Association show. ''But if you increased or decreased the number of teams, it would only be a matter of degree. What baseball did with the wild card was to fundamentally change everything.''
