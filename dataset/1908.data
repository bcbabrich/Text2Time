Updated, 11 p.m. | It was the aviation equivalent of the arrival of the Queen Mary 2 in New York City. Today, the double-decker superjumbo Airbus 380, the largest plane ever manufactured, landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport, in its first commercial flight to the United States.

The A380, an Emirates Air plane from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, landed around 4:30 p.m. A last-minute shift in wind caused the airport to change the landing path to a much shorter runway (which made the plane very low to the ground when it landed, barely clearing the trees).

The size and amenities of the A380 are jaw dropping. The first class section has luxury cruise ship features — showers and spas and private suites, furnished with personal mini-bars, wardrobes, and massage system. The plane can fly up to 7,456 miles on a full load, which carries 14 first class, 76 business and 399 economy seats.

The plane is so large that airports around the world, including Kennedy, had to spend an average of $100 million to upgrade the taxiways to accommodate its heft.

(An earlier version of this article, and the accompanying headline, described the A380 as the world’s largest plane. Airbus calls it the world’s largest passenger airliner. But as several readers helpfully noted in their comments, there are larger plane, though they were not designed for commercial passenger service.)

By the time the A380 debuted commercially last year, it was already two years late and 50 percent over its initial $12 billion budget. To date there are 202 orders for the A380 from 17 customers. Emirates Air is the largest customer, having ordered 58 planes.

Airbus said the updated design means the plane is getting 20 percent greater efficiency on a seat-mile basis than any other airplane, which is more critical than ever as fuel prices have forced airlines to seek savings in the smallest ways. The Airbus A380 also became the first commercial aircraft to fly with a synthetic liquid fuel processed from gas in a three-hour flight between Filton, England, and Toulouse, France.

Kennedy International Airport, however, is no longer considered the top place to showcase a new plane. The A380 debuted commercially in October 2007 with a Singapore Airlines flight between Singapore and Sydney.

But 40 years ago, J.F.K. was chosen as the stage for the debut of the Boeing 747, a plane which began the jumbo-jet age and held the record for passenger capacity for four decades until it was eclipsed by the Airbus A380.

For its maiden commercial voyage, the 747 hurtled down the runway at Kennedy Airport bound for London on Jan. 21, 1970. It was a Pan American World Airways flight, once an icon of flying chic.

J.F.K., which was built originally on some 1,000 acres of marshy land, long reigned as one the world’s most celebrated airports. But that seems no longer the case. (We already know that, at least when it comes to long-haul flights, the best airlines are not necessarily the American ones.)

Among the top 10 finishers of the World Airport Awards in 2008 were five airports in Asia, four in Europe and one in Africa (Cape Town, South Africa). The highest-ranked American airport was San Francisco International Airport, at No. 11.

The top 10 award winners this year were:

Hong Kong International Airport Singapore Changi International Airport Incheon International Airport in Seoul, South Korea Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia Munich Airport in Germany Kansai International Airport in Osaka Bay Copenhagen Airport in Denmark Zurich Airport in Switzerland Helsinki Vantaa Airport in Finland Cape Town International Airport in South Africa

The top-ranked airports are thorough modern, with features like free Wi-Fi and high-speed train service to downtown.

Kennedy Airport, once the Jewel of the Jet Age, has become the bane of many world travelers. Despite the arrival of the AirTrain, there is still no efficient way to get directly from Lower or Midtown Manhattan to the airport, in Jamaica, Queens. And the airport has been hobbled by a layout in which each airline has its own terminal or ticketing area.

Over the past two decades, other cities like Atlanta and Denver have built airports that are considered more modern than J.F.K., which as early as 1990 was facing challenges. In recent years, the airport has undergone renovations, but the construction has sometimes compounded the misery of travel, with disruptive barricades, rerouted traffic and makeshift quarters.
