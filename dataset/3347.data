For more than a half-hour after the Yankees' 5-4 victory in Seattle Wednesday, a voice resounded throughout their clubhouse, in a familiar refrain. ''Ball one,'' Glenallen Hill shouted. ''Ball two. Ball three.'' A couple of minutes would go by. ''Ball four. Ball one. Ball two. Ball three. . . .'' And so on.

It probably was not a coincidence that Hill's solo act followed a brutally slow 4-hour-8-minute game -- nine innings -- in which the home-plate umpire, Chris Guccione, earned the wrath of both teams for his seeming reluctance to call strikes. In the very first inning, David Cone threw a slider that appeared to be right down the middle, on an 0-2 pitch to Rickey Henderson, and Guccione called it a ball. This went on and on, with players from both sides frustrated with Guccione, a minor league umpire called up as a temporary replacement.

Joe Torre, who has become increasingly critical about the quality of the strike zone interpretations he is seeing this year, seemed more exasperated with Guccione after the game than pleased that his team won.

''The best thing that I can say about the umpiring is that there were four of them,'' Torre said. ''I think he had trouble seeing the ball sometimes.''
