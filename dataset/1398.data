Edson Buddle may be largely out of sight in Germany’s second division, but he is doing his best to make sure he isn’t out of mind as the United States national team continues to search for goal scorers.

Buddle scored with both feet on Saturday — a right-footed drive in the ninth minute and a left-footed lob in the 20th — but his club, F.C. Ingolstadt, lost to Bochum, 5-3.

Saturday’s performance was Buddle’s second two-goal effort in three games, and gives him five goals this season. That’s more than Juan Agudelo, Teal Bunbury and DaMarcus Beasley have had in the past two months, but those three — along with Jozy Altidore and Landon Donovan — were included on U.S. Coach Jurgen Klinsmann’s roster for the team’s coming friendlies against Honduras and Ecuador.

Klinsmann called in Buddle for his first game, a tie against Mexico in August, and praised his work rate even though he failed to create much and tired while working largely on his own.

But now, given that the Americans have scored only once in six halves since Klinsmann took over, should Buddle be one of the first names on his speed dial if someone has to pull out of camp this week? Or do you have faith in the players Klinsmann picked to finally get the U.S. on the board again?
