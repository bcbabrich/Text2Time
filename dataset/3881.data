To the Editor:

Your Sept. 25 news article on health maintenance organizations that want ''legally enforceable national standards'' for H.M.O.'s puts me in mind of the notes left by serial killers: ''Stop me before I kill again.''

These health maintenance organizations are free to incorporate these excellent ideas in their own contracts now, making them enforceable by the time-honored remedies for breach of contract.

Far from placing them at a competitive disadvantage, astute marketing should increase their share of the market. They should flaunt their adherence to these standards in all their advertising and heap scorn on the H.M.O.'s that refuse to do the same. Ethical employers will seek them out and boast of their high-quality health care in their recruitment ads. It would not take long before Medicaid and Medicare refused to contract with H.M.O.'s not in compliance.

Competition in the field has been based entirely on price until now. What a marvelous advance it would be to see health maintenance organizations competing on the quality of their contractual obligations. Government regulation is unnecessary. The patient is far more motivated to enforce his rights than some overworked bureaucrat.
