The young Manning's goals might have been set back when he was 6, listening to taped reruns of radio broadcasts of his father's games at Ole Miss (he can still name the starting lineup from the '69 team). Or maybe when he and his older brother used to toss wadded-up tape around the New Orleans Saints' locker room after their dad's pro games, pretending it was a football. The important thing is that they were his goals to set.

"Dad never really pushed us into football," Peyton said. "He never really let us play it on the playground. He never worked with me, like one-on-one passing drills, until I was a freshman in high school. It was always a situation where I had to come to him, ask him if he wanted to go work out. He never pushed me into anything."

Peyton pushed himself. His accomplishments thus far have to have exceeded his goals, which he keeps to himself. The numbers alone are telling. Thrown into the fray as a true freshman last year when Tennessee lost its first two quarterbacks to injury, he was 7-1 as a starter. This season he led Tennessee to a 10-1 record and broke school passing records for attempts (380), completions (244), completion percentage (64.2) and yardage (2,954).

All that, and he beat Alabama, too, the first quarterback to lead the Vols to a victory over the hated Crimson Tide in 10 years. But as impressive as his achievements are, his overall persona is just as remarkable. This player, it seems, is just too good to be true. Before he had even taken a snap as a freshman, Manning already had dissected hours of Tennessee game film. He had worked out on his own, five days a week. It was no surprise, then, when Manning quickly moved ahead of Brandon Stewart, another freshman whom many believed was the superior athlete, simply by outworking him. Stewart transferred to Texas A&M, where he probably will start next year, and Manning is now well on his way to breaking every Tennessee passing record.

Every college coach who interviewed Manning when he was coming out of tiny Isadore Newman High in New Orleans knew how special he was. And there were many interviews, most of which ended up being conducted by Peyton Manning. Notre Dame's Lou Holtz said he had never heard so many questions, all of them pertinent, from a recruit. Bobby Bowden of Florida State, the first coach to send Manning a letter, said the same thing.

Tennessee's offensive coordinator, David Cutcliffe, just smiles and shakes his head when he talks about Manning.

"When he came on his official visit, I spent more time watching tape with him than I ever had with any quarterback," Cutcliffe says. "Peyton is driven. He takes care of business in everything. He is the best worker that we have in the meeting room. He is best worker we have on the practice field. He's the best worker we have in the weight room."
