Robo-Sauce

Written by Adam Rubin. Illustrated by Daniel Salmieri.

“Robo-Sauce” begins with a wise-guy voice talking to the book’s main character and saying the very same words that opened Rubin and Salmieri’s best-selling “Dragons Love Tacos”: “Hey, kid!” This time our protagonist and his dog are dressed in robot costumes made out of cardboard, and the voice first compliments him, then begins to taunt him for not being a “real robot.” The solution, he’s told, is a recipe for “robo-sauce.” The stuff is rendered in the most neon shade of orange imaginable, which Salmieri uses judiciously throughout the book, making his always delightful squiggly-lined drawings pop in whole new ways. The sauce turns the boy into the genuine article, complete with an electrical charge and an array of gizmos that can turn everyone around him into a robot, too. Amid the ensuing mayhem the voice begins to back down: “You’re supposed to realize that you miss being a human,” it whines.

In the three years since “Dragons Love Tacos,” that sort of cheeky breaking down of the power dynamic between author and character has become common in picture books. So this time, Rubin and Salmieri have another trick to offer. Book-savvy children may notice that this one comes without a jacket. That’s because just as the boy-as-robot appears poised for world domination, the reader is instructed to pull out a long gatefold and follow the directions, which leads to the creation of a book jacket for an entirely new book made out of the final few pages, now by necessity viewed upside down. This new book, its title page tells us, is called “Robo-Book” and has “data by Adroid Rubot” and “images by Salmatron 5000.” There are a lot of beeps and boops, and then the glorious victory over the humans by our little robot-hero, who has converted his entire family into his own kind. It’s a gimmick, and it works beautifully, folding into all the lunacy a lesson in paper engineering. In the final image everyone is again in cardboard robot outfits, that creative staple of modern childhood.
