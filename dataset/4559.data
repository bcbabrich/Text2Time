The most potent symbol in the new film "The Inner Circle" is the one audiences will never see. It's inside Lenin's head -- literally. Andrei Konchalovsky, the film's director, gained permission to shoot numerous scenes in the Moscow headquarters of the K.G.B., whose lobby is dominated by a massive bust of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the first chief of the Soviet secret police. Mr. Konchalovsky wanted to move the sculpture and replace it with a bust of Lenin, but on this point he could not prevail. "So we simply wrapped Lenin around Dzerzhinsky," the director said, laughing. What appears on screen is a gleaming steel head of Lenin, thinking a private, very frightening thought.

The nightmare that unfolded from that thought is the subject of Mr. Konchalovsky's first film on Russian themes since the highly acclaimed "Siberiade," made in 1979. "The Inner Circle" surveys the Stalin years through the eyes of Ivan Sanshin, a young, idealistic Communist who works as the Kremlin's film projectionist. The character is based on Aleksandr Ganshin, who showed films for Stalin and other top Government figures, including Lavrenti Beria, chief of the secret police. A Nation Seduced

The action of the film moves back and forth between this closed world of privilege and absolute power, portrayed in scenes shot on location in the Kremlin and in K.G.B. headquarters, and the dismal communal apartment that Ivan and his bride, Anastasiya, share with ordinary Muscovites. The film marks a dramatic return to native ground for the director, who has made films including "Tango and Cash," with Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, and "Runaway Train," starring Jon Voight, since leaving the Soviet Union in 1979.

Mr. Konchalovsky uses the metaphor of a love affair to explain his view of Stalinism. "I am trying to speak about the seduction of an entire nation," he said in a recent interview in New York City en route to his home in Los Angeles. "For that reason, Stalin had to be attractive. Evil cannot gain ground if it is not seductive."
