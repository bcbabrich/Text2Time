The MFS Communications Company, the largest provider of high-speed telephone and data services to businesses, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Internet service provider Uunet Technologies in an exchange of stock valued at $2 billion.

Analysts said the proposed acquisition, which was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, underscored the rising importance of the Internet as a business communications medium. The deal would also create a new type of telecommunications company, one that will be able to link national and international companies with high-speed telephone, Internet and video transmissions.

This shows that the Internet is a lot closer to the traditional telecommunications area than anyone thought," said Ken Leon, senior vice president of the Chicago Corporation in New York.

And it could get even closer. Investors saw the alliance as a possible starting gun for a long-awaited consolidation of the Internet service provider business, generated by telephone companies that are looking to buy, rather than build, their own Internet expertise.
