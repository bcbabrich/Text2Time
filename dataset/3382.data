Katherine Schulten, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes-1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider why people enjoy traveling, and describe one place they would like to visit and why.

2. Examine a subjective itinerary of New York City sites by reading and discussing “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame.”

3. Plan, as a class, how to write and compile a Travel Guide to their town, written for kids their own age.

4. Write rough drafts of personal reviews for individual entries in this Travel Guide.

5. Rewrite, edit, illustrate and compile these individual reviews into one Guide in future classes.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-paper

-copies of “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “What, for you, makes a place desirable to visit? What place would you most like to visit? Why?” Students then share their answers.

2. As a class, read and discuss “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What is the overall tone of this piece? How would you compare such a subjective, personal guide to New York with, say, an encyclopedia description of the City?

b. What one site or attraction described in this piece would you most like to visit? Why?

c. What is the difference between an adventure and a “misadventure”? What misadventures have you been on?

d. What “street smart” advice does Edward the City Cousin give? What “street smart” advice could you give a visitor to your town?

e. What does it mean to “get in touch with your inner Auntie Mame”? How does that attitude seem to define this whole article?

3. Tell students they will be creating a Visitor’s Guide to their own town, written specifically for kids their age. Each student will choose a site, event, and/or activity to write about; later the class will edit and illustrate this work to compile into one pamphlet or book. As a class, decide how this work should best be done. (Should students form small groups, each taking charge of one category of activity, such as “eating,” “shopping,” “the arts,” or “sports”? Should the class compile a list of “must-include” items together, then assign individuals to write each? Or, should individual students simply submit one review each of a place, event, or attraction they highly recommend?) The teacher may choose one of these methods, or ask the class to decide how it would best be done. Teacher and/or students may also broaden or narrow the overall topic depending on the size of the community. (For example, in a large city, students may choose to simply write a list of the best places in one neighborhood; in a small town, students might include attractions and seasonal events from a whole region). After the class compiles a list, have students select one topic each, making sure that no students have the same topic.

4. Students begin to individually plan and craft their own reviews, using those in “Children Visiting? Just Invoke Auntie Mame” as a model.

5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students visit or research in some other way, the sites or attractions they have been assigned, and continue to polish their entries. In future classes, students can meet as a whole class, or in small group teams, to decide how to illustrate, edit, and compile these individual entries to create one book or pamphlet. Classes might then think of where and how to distribute the results – and consider anywhere from the school newspaper to the town Visitor’s Center to a website.

Further Questions for Discussion:

a. What is the best adventure you ever had while traveling or hosting a visitor? The worst misadventure?

b. Where did you most like to visit in your area when you were younger? When and why do you think you outgrew it?

c. Does travel “broaden the mind”? Why or why not?

d. Do you think you would want to attend a college far from home, or nearby? Why?

e. Where do kids your age seem to “hang out” most in your area? Why do you think that is?

f. What makes a place appealing to people your age? How could your town be made more appealing for you and your peers?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and small group discussions and planning sessions, and creation of individual entries for the class Traveler’s Guide.

Vocabulary:

symmetry, chaperon, honing, mortification, nonchalance, relishes, dispenser, overfranchised, evoke, itineraries, jaded, cicerones, venerable, myriad, doting, warren, memorabilia, eminently, gawk, intermittently, campy, boisterous

Extension Activities:

1. Read the novel “Auntie Mame” or watch the movie, and imagine an “Auntie Mame” figure in your own life who would brighten the humdrum. Then write an essay or short story that describes how your life might change as a result.

2. Create a “traveler’s guide” or map to the world of a character in a book you have read. Be sure to see this world from the character’s point of view rather than your own. How would his or her “take” on this place differ from a reader’s?

3. Write the speech you would deliver if you were chosen as a tour guide to your school. What sites would you make sure to point out to visitors? What would you say about them? What other information would you include?

4. Write an essay about either a great adventure, or a great misadventure you have had while traveling.

5. Create a pitch to deliver to your principal arguing for a one-day educational class trip to a site or event about which you think your teachers may not have recognized the educational value. What would your class learn? What assignments might be given? How would this visit relate in some way to curricula you are studying?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Plan an educational tour that students in your school could go on next summer that will feature at least 5 important historical sites central to some theme in American history. Your theme can be as specific and “offbeat” as you like (“scandals in American history,” “technological innovations,”) but should be something the school would deem educational. Write a rationale for the overall theme and for each site included.

Geography- What ten places in the world do you most want to visit? Note each on a map of the world, along with the important topographical information about each place and reasons why you listed them.

Global History

-If you could visit any time or place in history, what would it be? Write an essay describing the time and place you would choose and why. What specific events and/or people would you want to see? What questions might you ask your “hosts” on this visit?

-Museums are a big tourist attraction all over the world. How did museums come to be? When and where was the first created? What are the strangest museums you can find? Which would you most like to visit and why?

Technology- Visit a number of websites that concern travel to specific places in order to get ideas for a website of your own. Then design a website that displays the information compiled in your class Traveler’s Guide (or a guide of your own) in some way that will make people want to visit.

background: Teachers may want to explain the “Auntie Mame” reference in the title and text of the article. (It is the title of a novel by Patrick Dennis – made into both a famous movie and a famous play – in which an orphan boy goes on wild escapades with his eccentric, loveable aunt).
