This explains the new enthusiasm for controlling nitrogen compounds from coal-burning power plants. It also explains why Congress created the Ozone Transport Commission, made up of representatives of 12 Northeastern states plus the District of Columbia who have the mandate to figure out strategies for controlling regionwide smog sources.

Some important anti-smog measures are already dictated by Federal law, and are thus uncomplicated by the push and shove of regional interests. For example, the region will benefit from tougher emissions standards to be applied to new cars nationwide.

But Eric Svenson of New Jersey's giant utility, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, argues that such measures "alone won't even come close" to helping the states meet ozone standards during the dog days of summer. That leaves it to the states to explain how they are going to reduce volatile organic compounds emissions 15 percent by 1996, plus cut both organic and nitrogen compounds by 3 percent annually.

The members of the Ozone Transport Commission made headlines in February by asking the Environmental Protection Agency to impose on the Northeast the same exceptionally stringent standards on new autos that will be required in smog-burdened California. But Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Virginia demurred, because of worries about the cost. And the American automobile industry is fighting back, offering to produce a vehicle that would be cleaner sooner, but would not meet the California standard.

Hardly anyone is claiming that the California vehicle standards alone would get the Northeast where it must go. Then what? Targeting nitrogen compounds, with heavy emphasis on power plants, which produce about half of the region's emissions. But the states are bitterly divided on how to proceed, and no wonder. Smog in the Corridor

The worst smog in the region is along the "Amtrak corridor" from Washington to Boston. But the bulk of the nitrogen compounds, notes John Elston, New Jersey's official in charge of air quality, comes from plants far to the west. And such areas have little motivation to pitch in because little of the benefit would go to their own ratepayers.

Adding sand to the wheels of negotiation, there is still much debate over allowing smog producers to pay rather than to play. A free market trading system already gives power plants broad discretion in controlling emissions that generate acid rain. A dirty plant can buy pollution rights from a clean plant, for example.
