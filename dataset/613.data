Enough plot summary. There is much too much plot in any case, and a little too much heavy weaponry for my taste. Like Dom, I prefer fisticuffs and car chases to apocalyptic computer-generated explosions, but I must admit that some of the digital stunts hit the sweet spot of wacky, oh-no-they-didn’t sublimity. Cars are driven out of airplanes. They soar between skyscrapers. They hurtle over cliffs. Nearly everything that happens is the visual punch line to a joke with a very simple set up. “Cars can’t fly,” Brian says to his son. How many ways can dad be proven wrong?

But viewers of “Furious 7” will experience a melancholy, earthward tug whenever Mr. Walker, who died in 2013, appears on screen. Filming was not complete when he died in a car accident, and his brothers, Cody and Caleb, and another actor, John Brotherton, filled in during some scenes. Mr. Wan also relied on his special-effects experience to finish the movie without Mr. Walker. The final moments, when Mr. Walker’s longtime colleagues say their farewells while he still appears to be on screen with them, are both awkward and moving. They remind you what these movies have always been about, underneath all the noise and the bravado: the ferocity of friendship and the terrible speed of loss.

“Furious 7” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some swearing and violence, but not as much as you are likely to hear — or contemplate visiting on your fellow citizens — during an average rush-hour commute.
