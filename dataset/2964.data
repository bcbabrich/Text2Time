This summer the bookstore chain Borders is starting a program to apply the market research techniques of the grocery store business to the sales of novels and nonfiction books. One of its first lessons may be that comparing books to frozen foods is a sure way to raise the ire of authors, regardless of the details.

Last week, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky and 26 other authors signed a letter to the chairman of Borders, Gregory P. Josefowicz, arguing that the new program, called category management, would hurt small publishers and narrow the stores' selection. Their main gripe was that Borders invited publishers -- for fees that can reportedly run more than $100,000 -- to be ''category captains'' for each of 250 categories, from cookbooks to thrillers.

Learning of the program, Mr. Nader and the authors began to fear that the sponsoring publishers would effectively control the shelves at the stores at the expense of others, promoting their own books over those from smaller publishers and reducing the variety of titles sold.

''There is a difference between books and Pop-Tarts,'' the letter warned. ''Leave the category management to the soap merchants.''
