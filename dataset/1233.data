The scenery is breathtaking and the tone resolutely jaunty, but “High Ground,” which treks alongside 11 wounded United States veterans (and one bereft mother) to the top of a Himalayan mountain, leaves an inescapably poignant trace.

This has less to do with the wounds themselves — both visible and veiled — than with the astonishingly candid confessions of their bearers, hammered home all too often by careening combat footage. Whether displaying suck-it-up stoicism or hanging-by-a-thread fragility, these diverse men and women vividly convey the profound personal transformations their deployment has wrought. Scaling a 20,000-foot peak in Nepal might offer healing for some and for others an opportunity to test mobility and stamina; for everyone it’s an apt analogy for the challenge of readjusting to civilian life.

Capturing this inaugural expedition of a program called Soldiers to Summits, the director, Michael Brown (a renowned mountaineer), digs below the adventure itself to reveal the gaping holes in our veteran care. Doing so, he translates a collage of experiences — some desperate, some hopeful, all tragic — into a first-person commentary on the malign reverberations of war.
