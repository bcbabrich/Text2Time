We’ll be posting our World Club rankings periodically over the course of the season, a look at how the leading teams in the eight best pro hockey leagues across the planet would rate against one another. Theoretically, of course.

An explanation of the headings and methodology appears underneath the rankings. But first, here is the current World Club Top 10, reflecting results through Saturday night’s games:

…….club (league)………………………..gp w/o d o/l pts pct rtng

..1. Salavat Yulaev Ufa (RUS)….32 25/0 x 3/4 78 .812 44.7

..2. HV71 Jonkoping (SWE)……..25 17/1 3 0/4 57.5 .767 42.2

..3. SC Bern (SUI)…………………….27 19/2 x 3/3 64 .790 41.9

..4t Slavia Prague (CZE)………….26 17/3 x 2/4 59 .756 40.8

..4t Slovan Bratislava (SVK)……30 20/3 x 2/5 68 .756 40.8

..6. Karpat Oulu (FIN)……………..28 16/5 x 2/5 60 .714 39.3

..7. Eisbären Berlin (GER)……….25 17/2 x 0/6 55 .733 38.9

..8. Detroit Red Wings (NHL)….26 15/3 x 2/6 53 .679 38.4

..9. SKA St. Petersburg (RUS) …32 20/3 x 0/9 66 .688 37.8

10. Espoo Blues (FIN)……………..26 16/1 x 3/6 53 .679 37.4



The headings are: the club and the league it plays in; games played (gp); wins in 60 minutes, worth 3 points, and wins in overtime or by shootout, worth 2 (w/o); draws, which happen only in Sweden and are worth 1.5 points (d); losses in overtime or by shootout, worth 1 point, and losses in 60 minutes, worth 0 (o/l); total points earned (pts); points percentage (pct); and the team’s overall rating (rtng). Each league is assigned a certain level of strength based on how well the league’s clubs have done in international tournaments and how well the nation has done in international competitions, and those levels figure into the mathematical formula. The NHL is by itself at the top level; the Russian, Swedish and Finnish leagues occupy the second level; the Czech and Slovak leagues the third level; and the Swiss and German levels the fourth level.

So, when you look at the line for the No. 1 club, Salavat Yulaev from the city of Ufa in the Russian Superliga, you see that they’ve played 32 games, won 25 in regulation and 0 in overtime or shootout, have an “x” in the draw column because there are no tie games in Russia, lost 3 in overtime or shootout and another 4 in regulation, all for a total of 78 points, which is 81.2 percent of the points available to them. All that is good for a rating of 44.7, best in the world.

When we first published these rankings last December and put the Finnish club Karpat Oulu at No. 1, we got pilloried by the superb and extremely useful French Web site hockeyarchives.com. “Meilleur club de hockey au monde ! C’est le titre que le prestigieux New York Times a décerné au Kärpät Oulu peu avant Noël,” the site announced, and even if you can’t read French you should be able to intuit the contempt that seeps across language barriers. “Par un étrange classement aux règles quelque peu basiques, le club finlandais y devançait Ak Bars Kazan et les Anaheim Ducks ! Venant d’un Européen, un tel résultat aurait été jugé osé et ridiculisé.”

You can hardly blame hockeyarchives.com, whose coverage of the European game is comprehensive, smart, funny, and generally terrific — they’ve been writing about continental hockey for a long time, and they’re well aware that it’s a stretch to claim that a top European club is better than a top NHL club.

But as hockeyarchives also pointed out, the idea of an American comparing European teams with NHL teams is a bit different. And indeed it is — mainly because in Canada and the U.S. there has traditionally been so little recogniton of European club hockey.

For so many years, the phrases you’d hear from the hockey commentators and experts on this side of the Atlantic were simply “he played in Sweden” or “he spent a season in the Russian elite league”. No names of clubs, no awareness that almost all those clubs are much older and have a much deeper sense of tradition that almost every NHL franchise, no inkling that fans in Europe’s small rinks are far more raucous and passionate than the anesthetized fans in the NHL’s cavernous arenas.

Even when European players would arrive on these shores and immediately constitute 75 percent of the NHL’s top scorers’ list, large chunks of all-star teams, and skate with and sometimes past the national teams of Canada and (far more often) the US, as they have done for a generation or two, North American commentators still didn’t bother to learn about the clubs and leagues that made those players.

Fortunately that’s begun to change, thanks mainly to the Internet, and now you’ll actually see Canadian and American newspaper articles that contains words like “Metallurg Magnitogorsk”. Well, occasionally. Nevertheless, the idea that a European club might really be good enough to give a tough game to an NHL team is still too much for a lot of North American hockey types to bear.

But sports fans here ought to know better, at least those whose memories or knowledge extends to the AFL’s upsets of the NFL in the late ’60s Super Bowls, or the USSR’s upsets of top Canadian teams in the ’70s and ’80s, or international basketball teams’ upsets of US Olympic teams in the late ’90s, or the teams that beat the Americans in the World Baseball Classic just last year, or any other example of unknown and supposedly inferior teams shocking famous ones. Really, there is no question that the top European teams belong on the same ice as the top NHL teams — as we shall finally see this September, when the Victoria Cup finally ushers in a new era of Europe-vs.-NHL club competition.

That’s why we do these rankings, and each time we post one, we’ll look at one of the European teams in it. And we’ll learn lots about Bashkortostan, stoats, and lighting hundreds of road flares in a crowded arena when your team takes the ice, we promise.
