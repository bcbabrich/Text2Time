To the Editor:

In his Aug. 20 letter, Philip E. German complained of his inability to purchase seats closer than 13 rows from the stage for a performance of ''Nicholas Nickleby'' sometime in November. Mr. German's dissatisfaction translated into the bizarre conclusion that the box-office treasurer regarded him as a ''dummy'' who didn't know that ''the first rows go to, or are held in reserve for, important people - scalpers, brokers, tippers and apparatchiks.''

Without debating whether the 13th or succeeding rows are good seats, which indeed they are in the intimate Broadhurst Theater, the facts are that all seats in the theater are programmed into a computer, which sells them on a best-available basis; that substantial sections of several rows in front of the 13th are withheld from public sale because of the artistic requirements of the show; that 44 seats in the center section are reserved as house seats pursuant to contractual arrangements with the author-adapter, the director, the Royal Shakespeare Company and others, and that no seats are held in reserve for important people, scalpers, brokers, tippers or apparatchiks.

We are in the business of selling the best seats available on a first-come, first-served basis to anyone who appears at the box office, calls our national telephone ticket sales center or elects to use one of the 800 Ticketron outlets in the United States. Had Mr. German used the telephone or gone to a Ticketron outlet, the identical tickets would have been proffered to him. Perhaps then he would not have drawn his erroneous conclusions.
