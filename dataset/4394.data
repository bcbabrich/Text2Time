To the Editor:

John M. Hoffmann (letter, Nov. 24) concludes that driving is safer than flying. His premise, that the important factor is fatality rate per hour spent traveling, is false.

Most of us travel to get to a destination, with the important factor being the safest way of getting there, or fatality rate per passenger-mile. In this, there is no contest: in a trip, say, from San Francisco to New York, the person who drives is 89 times likelier to be killed in an accident than the person who flies.

Mr. Hoffmann lives in Detroit, a city whose well-being depends in large part on promoting automobile use. Unfortunately, his reasoning doesn't fly. JOSEPH G. CARLETON Palo Alto, Calif., Nov. 26, 1994
