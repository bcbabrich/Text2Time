The first tremor of a problem was noticed a year ago by Mary Bond Davis, an actress who is also an amateur photographer. She had been using her free mornings to document the work of contractors clearing the lot next to her brick house on Irwin Avenue because she thought they were encroaching on her land.

Ms. Bond Davis was also worried about the earth workers were removing near the base of a 210-foot-long retaining wall that propped up Riverdale Avenue atop a ridge overlooking her backyard.

Ms. Bond Davis, who was then appearing in ''The Women'' on Broadway, was not the only one. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz drove by one day with Councilman G. Oliver Koppell, and said, ''It looks like an accident waiting to happen.''

Two days later, the wall collapsed. ''I thought I was in an earthquake,'' Ms. Bond Davis said, although she, her house and her cat went unscathed. Steve Varkaris, a partner of Outlook Realty, the company that owns the land, said the wall had collapsed because it was old and unsound.
