At the urging of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York City hotel owners and their union workers agreed yesterday to continue negotiating into the holiday weekend and to put off a strike or lockout, at least until midnight on Tuesday.

The collective bargaining agreement between the Hotel Association of New York City, which is representing 79 of its member hotels in the talks, and the 22,000-member New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, expired last night. Union members -- bellhops, waiters, bartenders, room attendants and others -- voted earlier this week in favor of a strike called by union leaders against any or all of the association's hotels.

Many association hotels had agreed to lock out their union workers should a strike be called against any one of them.

Talks had been stalled for several days. After intense discussions late last week, progress was reported, but on Monday, the union president and chief negotiator, Vito Pitta, walked out of a session because of a dispute. The focus was the hotels' desire for greater leeway in attracting independent concessionaires to run restaurants and other services within the hotels.
