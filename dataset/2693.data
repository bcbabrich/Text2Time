A police chief who came under fire for using a racial slur about black people retired early from the Keansburg Police Department effective yesterday. Police Chief Michael P. Kennedy used the slur on May 2 while giving orders to police officers, referring to a crowd of people as potential troublemakers. He apologized and lost about $9,500 in pay over the incident, but the N.A.A.C.P. and other community groups continued to call for his ouster. Efforts to find Chief Kennedy's home phone number were not successful; he was not at the station yesterday afternoon, said Patrolman Robert Sheehan, who answered a call seeking comment.
