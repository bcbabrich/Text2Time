Oh, and don't worry about him taking his time mulling over script ideas. He said that the company was already planning to shoot a movie version of the play ''Hospitality Suite,'' and that he expected to direct what he called ''a bigger, more personal story, maybe in a year or so.'' Some movies he may just produce, without appearing in front of or behind the camera, he said.

''I wanted to do something that wasn't a vanity deal,'' said Mr. Spacey, referring to the fact that many studios offer successful actors production arrangements that actually generate few if any movies. ''There's a real opportunity for my company to become a player.''

The company's deal with Fine Line Cinema, a unit of Time Warner's New Line, allows him to retain foreign distribution rights on some of his films and to create over time a library of movies in which he will own a substantial interest.

''I'm interested in walking down roads I haven't walked down before,'' Mr. Spacey said.

At this busy time in his career it is striking, though, that he is currently appearing in ''Hurlyburly,'' a movie that represents an unusually well-trodden road. As Mr. Spacey noted, when he made the leap from regional theater to the New York stage some years ago, it was by acting in ''Hurlyburly.''

In fact, he said, he played almost every part in the dark drama before the run was through and his career had begun. In the film, he plays the smooth, reptilian Mickey.
