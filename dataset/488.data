When Vanessa Packer, the founder of the fitness studio ModelFIT, gets together for a monthly dinner with her fellow fitness-studio-owning friends Alexandra Bonetti Pérez (of the cardio-dance Bari studio) and Sarah Larson-Levey (of the yoga chain Y7), they indulge.

“Who wants some rosé?” asked Ms. Packer, 32, as she finished preparations on the kale salad with grilled halloumi cheese, zucchini carpaccio with fresh herbs and toasted pistachios, and the warm farro with radish and yams that is a riff on a salad at Charlie Bird, one of Ms. Packer’s favorite restaurants.

The three women have a monthly supper club that rotates menu and locations. “I emailed them one day and was like, ‘Let’s all meet up,’” said Ms. Bonetti Pérez, who is 30 and a former financial and management consultant.

Her peers immediately saw the benefits. “Camaraderie is important,” Ms. Packer said. “We all want to do something different within health and wellness, so why not join as a united front instead of being catty and judgey?”
