To the Editor:

After sweating out my tax return for the 50-something year, I was startled to read a complaint by Neil Howe and William Strauss ("America's 13th Generation," Op-Ed, March 16) that added insult to injury. They said young workers see "increases in taxes they pay while tax rates on elders are falling."

It is true that taxes have gone up unfairly for young workers. Also for middle-aged workers, and for elderly workers. Indeed, a good case can be made that elders who continue to work are the most heavily taxed Americans today. That is because from retirement age to 70, Social Security pensions are reduced by a portion of earnings, and after 70 1/2 workers are now denied the privilege of sheltering earnings in individual retirement accounts. All the while, these elders must continue to pay full Social Security taxes on earnings, usually with no increase in benefits.

The extra personal exemption for over-65's has been repealed. No complaint here, but the costs of health care are no longer deductible until they exceed 7.5 percent of gross income. Since the elderly require more care, their out-of-pocket costs have risen more than the average despite what Mr. Howe and Mr. Strauss call "a national health-care system that insures the affluent old while leaving the young with no coverage."

Now, depending on how one defines affluence, the affluent comprise no more than 2 percent or 3 percent of Medicare patients, who also include disabled workers. But the elderly also as a group provide the most enthusiastic support for a civilized cradle-to-grave health-care system.
