WASHINGTON, Oct. 2—The Brooklyn Democratic organization has informed Representative John J. Rooney, an ailing 69‐year‐old legislator who is one of the most powerful men in Congress that it will not support him if he seeks a 17th term.

Mr. Rooney, who oversees Congressional appropriations for the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce, will not be backed by the Brooklyn organization “because of his illness, and because it is doubtful he can regain his seat,” said a top Brooklyn Democratic leader, who asked not to be identified.

“He can't win,” the leader said in an interview with The New York Times, “and the name of the game is to win.”

Mr. Rooney represents the 14th Congressional District, which takes in Red Hook, Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Brooklyn Heights. He is a crusty man who forgoes interviews and news conferences, and he could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts to find him in his office in the Rayburn Building.
