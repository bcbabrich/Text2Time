If we think hard enough now, and if after the troops come home we just hang on to what we learned, the United States can pluck a surprise bonus from the victory in the gulf: a few fine victories at home.

Oh, how drearily often during the war we got sophomoric lectures from the sob-sisters of journalism, politics and academia (both sexes) about how the war would still leave us with all the domestic problems bedeviling the country: drugs, crime, race, AIDS, S.& L.'s, homelessness, recession, teen-age pregnancy, graffiti, garbage, loud radios and paper cracklers at the movies.

The lectures came from the renowned experts who were against the war effort. They tried to paralyze us by warning of tens of thousands of American body bags, and now caution us against trying to get rid of Saddam Hussein lest some of his followers feel humiliated -- today's appeasement catchword.

Americans do not need the condescending lectures. They know the war was fought to eliminate a particularly vicious international serial killer bent on conquering a part of the world critical to us and our friends -- including people who live there. Goal enough. It was reached in 100 hours of ground combat, following brilliant campaigns of political and air bombardment.
