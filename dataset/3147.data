The Liberty kept going back in time last week. Its loss at Portland sent the team back to 1999, the last time it had dropped three in a row. Its loss at Utah on Wednesday sent it back to 1998, the last time the team had lost four in a row. It ended the four-game losing streak Saturday with a 64-61 victory at Houston and returned home with a 1-2 mark on the trip.

''That was a big win,'' forward Sue Wicks said yesterday. ''We need to win a couple more to be back.''

The Liberty (17-9) will next face the Detroit Shock (7-18) tonight at Madison Square Garden.

Coach Richie Adubato changed the Liberty's starting lineup on the trip. Against Utah, Wicks started for Tamika Whitmore on the front line. The Liberty needed more size against 7-foot-2 Margo Dydek and, Adubato said, ''we felt that Tamika was playing in a shooting slump.''

The 6-3 Wicks, who was averaging 5.4 points and 20.8 minutes, played 58 minutes and scored 22 points combined in the two games.
