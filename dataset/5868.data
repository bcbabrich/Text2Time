At present the Labor Party holds a 25-seat majority. The comparison, however, is somewhat misleading because the House of Representatives has been increased for this election from 125 seats to 148 seats, a result of recent redistricting to reflect population changes.

The campaign has not been filled with sharp debates over issues, mainly because Mr. Hawke has transformed his party from an often shrill advocate of trade unionism into a champion of economic growth and cooperation between labor and management. Thus, he has successfully captured the middle ground of Australian politics, undercutting the conservative opposition.

''Australia is conservative and so is Bob Hawke,'' said Don Aitkin, a professor of political science at the Australian National University in Canberra. Booming Economy Is Factor

In his 21 months in office, Mr. Hawke has benefited from an end to a long drought in Australia and a worldwide economic recovery, led by the United States. But in addition, Mr. Hawke hammered out an accord soon after he took office between labor and management to restore growth, reduce inflation and avoid strikes in a nation with a tradition of labor strife. The agreement was accomplished in dramatic fashion at a national economic meeting in April 1983, and it has worked far better than most people at first thought possible.

Today the Australian economy is growing at a 10 percent annual rate and inflation is at its lowest point since 1970. For its part, unemployment has dropped by almost 2 percent.
