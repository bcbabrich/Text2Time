Stocks rose for the third session in a row yesterday on moderately higher volume, and the Dow Jones Industrial average, which was up more than 28 points in the early afternoon, finished 10.13 points higher at 2,627.25.

So far this week, the Dow has risen more than 63 points.

Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines, 917 to 565, as volume rose to 164.4 million shares, from 152.6 million on Tuesday.

It appeared that once again the movement of the stock market in Tokyo had little impact on the course of equities in the United States. The 225-stock Nikkei index climbed 694.04 points, or 2.05 percent, relatively a much larger increase than the Dow, which gained only four-tenths of 1 percent. Indeed, some analysts characterized this week's upward move by equities as primarily technical in nature.

''The stock market is exhibiting a markedly more durable tone in the midst of what appears to be a massive shift in both trading psychology and industry leadership,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
