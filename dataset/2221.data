It is payout time for managing directors of Greenhill & Company.

Nearly two years after the boutique investment bank staged its initial public offering, Greenhill said in a press release Monday afternoon that it plans to file with securities regulators for a secondary offering of 4.025 million shares. The shares are all held by current and former managing directors of Greenhill, the company said.

Based on Monday’s closing price of $66.31, the offering could raise nearly $267 million for the selling shareholders.

Greenhill’s stock has nearly quadrupled since May 2004, when it sold 5 million shares to its underwriters at $17.50 apiece. But the stock had a rough day on Monday, falling 6.5 percent on unusually high volume before the close of trading. The announcement about the secondary offering came shortly after 4 p.m. E.D.T.

Robert F. Greenhill, who founded Greenhill in 1996 and is its chairman and chief executive, own 6 million shares through various trusts he controls, or about 20.7 percent of the company’s equity. Scott Bok, Greenhill’s United States president, and Simon Borrows, its non-U.S. president, each own nearly 1.9 million shares, regulatory filings show.

Greenhill still has not indicated which managing directors will be selling shares in the secondary and how many shares they will sell.
