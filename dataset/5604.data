Helmsley Middletowne Hotel (838-1811) - *(April 4, 1986) Modeled after the original in New Delhi, this handsome and comfortable restaurant has sandstone-colored walls and soft lighting. The food, described as ''frontier cuisine,'' from the northwest, is a bright and brassy change of pace from more familiar Indian fare around town. Every entree is grilled over charcoal or roasted in the ancient clay oven, the tandoor; diners are given big checkered bibs and eat with their hands. The breads are terrific - from naan to roti to mint paratha. Recommended dishes include chicken Bukhara, which is first infused with yogurt, chili powder, ginger and garlic, then roasted; grilled veal chops, which are first marinated in rum and yogurt accented with cinnamon; and prawns tinged with garlic, white pepper and lemon juice. Dinner entrees $11 to $38.
