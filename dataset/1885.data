We said it here back in December, and even though they still haven’t won the Stanley Cup yet against a Penguins team with enormous potential, we’ll say it again anyway: the Detroit Red Wings are the gold standard for all of hockey.

The Wings were great from the start and, except for a stretch in February when they were hit hard by injuries, great the whole season long. And they were great in the way they have been for the last several years: by placing a heavy emphasis on winning the regular-season championship, and by playing a clean game that shunned fighting.

That we should see such a team ascend to the summit of hockey is such a fresh, hopeful sign, and exactly what the game needs the year after the Stanley Cup victory of the Red Wings’ moral opposites — the cynical, fight-instigating Anaheim Ducks, with their enormous penalty totals and derision of the Presidents’ Trophy as a useless prize. Because of the Ducks, we got this year’s brawling and suspension-ridden Flyers, and the fight-happy Calgary Flames, and the refusal of NHL clubs to draft Europeans because of “character questions.”

If the Red Wings hoist the Stanley Cup in the next handful of days, they will have repudiated all of those choices and, perhaps, shown the way to a better game. Maybe their victory will have the same effect as the Canadiens’ sweep of Philadelphia in the 1976 cup final, which helped quell the epidemic of senseless violence brought on by those Flyers and ushered in an era of freer-flowing hockey in its place.

Maybe a Wings’ victory will mean that next season, NHL teams will actually try to win the regular-season championship — so that if you pay a fortune for a ticket in December, you’ll actually see teams giving 100 percent. And maybe those teams, instead of starting fights, will stick to playing hockey. And maybe finally, at long last, the voices of reaction will cease their old, tired, reflexive whine about European softness.

Or maybe not. Maybe some retrograde outfit like the Ducks or Flyers will win in 2009 and wipe out the advances the Wings have brought to the NHL this year. But no matter what happens then, and no matter what happens Monday night or later in the week, one thing remains unchanged: The Detroit Red Wings have given hockey fans an amazing season, one that all of us have been lucky to witness.



Doing the Double: If the Wings do indeed prevail a fourth time against Pittsburgh, they’ll be the 10th team since 1980 to accomplish the utmost feat in a single campaign: winning both the regular-season crown and the Stanley Cup. That 1979-80 season was the year the NHL absorbed 4 WHA sides and expanded to 21 clubs over all, and the first season when 16 teams made the playoffs.

This is the current roll call of double champions:

1981 Islanders

1982 Islanders

1984 Edmonton

1987 Edmonton

1989 Calgary

1994 Rangers

1999 Dallas*

2001 Colorado

2002 Detroit
