Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, may be one of the most maligned men in Washington because he is the bearer of budget cuts. He has been accused of everything from ethnic cleansing to wanting to kill a million people. He gets “fan mail” with fake business cards tucked in that give his job title as a “starver of hungry children and elderly.”

To Mr. Mulvaney, this is evidence of a job well done.

“In our business that’s usually seen as a sign that the other side doesn’t know what to say substantively,” Mr. Mulvaney said during an interview Friday in his office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
