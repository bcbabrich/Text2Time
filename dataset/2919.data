To the Editor:

Citing the First Amendment, Stephen Gillers opposes a Minnesota rule that bars judicial candidates from announcing their views on issues likely to come before them if elected (''Let Judicial Candidates Speak,'' Op-Ed, March 28). But there are values of equal constitutional importance on the other side of this controversy: the right to fair and impartial courts.

Already that right is jeopardized by the increasing role of money in judicial elections. The public wants judges who dispense impartial justice, but three-quarters of voters now believe that campaign contributions are influencing judicial decisions.

Without safeguards like the one in Minnesota, judicial candidates will feel more pressure to speak to the special interests that pay for campaigns.
