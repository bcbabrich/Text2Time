Many of my recipes call for flat-leaf parsley, and I’m sure many of you have seen the rest of the bunch that you bought for the 2 tablespoons called for in the recipe go to waste in your refrigerator. Throwing out a limp or rotten bunch of parsley can be depressing as well as costly, so this week I decided to devote all five Recipes for Health to this wonderful, nutrient-dense herb, which should be regarded as a food, not just a garnish.

I’m convinced that parsley, used so abundantly in the cuisines of Greece, Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa, is one reason those diets are so healthy. In addition to being an excellent source of vitamins A, C and K and a good source of iron and folate, it is rich in volatile oils (which give it its astringent flavor) and flavonoids. The volatile oils contain components that have been shown to inhibit the activity of harmful elements in the body, and studies have attributed antioxidant properties to the flavonoids, particularly luteolin.

If you do buy a large bunch of parsley for one recipe and want to keep it for a few days in the refrigerator so you can use it in another, take the rubber band or twist-tie off the bunch and wash and spin dry in a salad spinner. I sometimes pick the leaves off at this point, but not always. Lay the parsley, whether stemmed or not, on a double or triple thickness of paper towel, and roll up. Make sure the toweling is damp (spray with a fine mist of water if not), and wrap in a kitchen towel or keep in a refrigerator bag.

It’s important to pick the parsley leaves off the stems, because unlike the stems of cilantro, parsley stems are tough and should be discarded. It’s sort of a tedious job, which is why I often stem the entire bunch at once to get it done. The leaves reduce quite a bit in volume when you chop them, especially if you chop them fine. 2 cups parsley leaves will yield a little over 1/2 cup of finely chopped parsley.
