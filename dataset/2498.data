Reader responses to Marjane Satrapi’s post “Defending My Country.”

Taraneh Kayhani Ferdman, San Juan, Puerto Rico: Just want to congratulate you on your clever message, your balanced view on life and, of course, your striking illustrations! You make us all Iranian-born women and men very proud to have your voice heard in The New York Times.

Sylvia Notini, Bologna, Italy: As an American who teaches English at the University of Bologna, I know a lot about defending Americans who are patriotic and against the war at the same time. It is hard for me to find a way to tell my students that I am just as horrified as they are by many of the bad things that Europeans read about Americans — that some Americans condone torture, that a presidential election can be questionable, that some people can believe that saying “freedom fries” instead of “French fries” will help make the world a better place. So I am grateful to The New York Times online for having allowed me to discover Marjane Satrapi, whose columns I can bring to class, not only to help me teach English, but also, and above all, to send a message to my students about the country I love.

Ken Hudson: I’m an American who served honorably and proudly for one year in Iraq. I came to know, appreciate, admire and even fell in love with Iraqi people. I reject your assertion that we imposed democracy by bombing the Iraqi people. The bombing that did take place was strategic and precise and it killed bad people who deserved to die. The world is a better place because of many of the evil people killed by American bombs. Saddam Hussein is on trial for crimes against humanity, [his sons] Uday and Qusay are DEAD and there are no more rape and torture chambers under the sanction of Iraq’s government.

Elodie Sutton, Washington: As a French-American, I often find myself having to defend either culture to friends and even family from both sides of the pond. Thank you for capturing and illustrating so eloquently the issues at hand. I think every American should read your article.

Beverly Tan, Miami: Cheers, Ms. Satrapi! Your illustrations are fabulous, as always, and the piece really resonated with me. Like you, I sometimes feel as if I am caught in a crossfire of rhetoric. I am ethnically Chinese, and the Bush administration has been particularly vociferous in deeming China a hotbed for human rights violations. Simultaneously, this same administration is wantonly bombing Iraq into oblivion to install a democratic government — whose actual goal is to guarantee the United States a steady supply of cheap gas. My hope is that other readers in the global community will understand that not every American is of the Freedom Fry variety. Many of us have tirelessly campaigned against Bush’s policies, and have been incensed and embarrassed to watch this so-called leader blunder his way through delicate international protocol. This is not the America that our forefathers fought for. Bush is not the leader that I chose, and he does not speak for me, just as he does not speak for many other Americans.

Maria, New York: I must admit that until I read “Persepolis,” I too thought that Iran was a mysterious country full of mysterious and very grumpy people. But you showed me that indeed Iranians are people very similar to Americans in that they love their country and are either in agreement with the regime in power or are very saddened to see their country run into the ground. We do not, however, have to endure the pain of not being able to make our lives at home. That is a tragedy and I sincerely hope that one day that will change.

Judy Parker, New York: Right on, Marjane! The number of us against this stupid president’s policies and black/white thinking are growing. If only our government will grow with us . . . meanwhile, please keep spreading the word that there are many of us independent, non Bible-belt thinkers in the U.S.

Mona, Boston: Thank you for a funny but so true story. I was born in Iran, grew up in Paris and now live in Boston. In the United States I often hear people say they don’t like us over there — meaning France. When in France, I have to tell many times the story of the warm and caring hug I got from an old man, George, on 9/11 in Boston, because we were both in tears. It takes a lot of effort to defend three countries. From now on, I will just travel with your cartoon in my back pocket. Merci!

Steve Denes, New York: What a wonderfully clear and concise statement Ms. Satrapi makes about defending “the other.” When I worked in Nigeria I had to explain Americans to Nigerians; now I have to explain Nigerians. Because I was born in Hungary I have to do the same and vice versa. Because I worked in East Harlem as a white man, I had to explain that, and vice versa. Because I married someone of another faith I explain that as well. I never see this as an obligation but rather as an opportunity and luxury. I think Ms. Satrapi would agree.

Ahmad Ramsheyi, Paris: As an Iranian educated in the United States and living in France, I share Majane Satrapi’s point of views on Bush’s shameful war on humanity. American people are wonderful people but a lot too naïve — to the point of putting their trust in the hands of crooked politicians who care only for themselves and tell people lies. Thank you, Ms. Satrapi. We need you.

Julie Nauman, Paris: As an American living in Paris, who has also lived in the Muslim world, all I can say to you is, thanks. I also find myself defending France, Muslims and, of course, the United States. We are diplomats of the world! If only I could do it with your charming drawings.
