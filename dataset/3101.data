Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students estimate the amount of money a non-smoking teen spends in a week, a month, and a year, and compare it with the expenses of a teen who smokes one, two, and three packs a day. They then research other reasons that teens should not smoke, and create an ad campaign geared toward young people emphasizing the financial and health benefits of not smoking.

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Compare the amount of money a smoker and a non-smoker spends weekly, monthly, and annually.

2. Learn about the correlation between the price of cigarettes and teen smoking by reading and discussing “Vital Signs: When Smoking Is a Matter of Money.”

3. Work in groups to identify reasons why young people should not smoke.

4. Create ad campaigns that encourage teens to quit or to not start smoking.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “Vital Signs: When Smoking Is a Matter of Money” (one per student)

-poster board, markers, crayons, old magazines, and other art materials that can be used to create students’ advertising campaigns

-reference materials with information about the health risks of cigarette smoking (computers with Internet access, encyclopedias, textbooks, library references)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “About how much money would you estimate that a smoker spends on cigarettes a week? A month? A year? If the price of cigarettes were to go up, do you think fewer people would smoke? Why or why not?” After 5 minutes, discuss student responses as a class. To check students’ estimates, assume a price of $3.50 for a pack of cigarettes. Thus, a pack-a-day smoker would spend about $24.50 a week, $98 a month, and $1,176 a year. A 2-pack a day smoker would spend $49 a week, $196 a month, and $2,352 a year, and a 3-pack-a-day smoker would spend $73.50 a day, $294 a month, and $3,528 a year. Invite students to compare this with what they estimate they spend daily, weekly, monthly, and annually on other things that they buy.



2. As a class, read and discuss “Vital Signs: When Smoking Is a Matter of Money,” focusing upon the following questions:

a. What, according to a new study, is the link between teen smoking and the price of cigarettes?

b. How many students were surveyed in the study?

c. Over what period of time was the study conducted?

d. How did this study compare with other similar studies that have been done?

e. What basic economic rule does this study help to prove?

f. Why were some experts unsure that this rule would apply to cigarette smoking?

g. What other fundamental fact of teens’ lives, according to the article, does this study help prove?



3. Encourage students to identify reasons why young people should not smoke, and list them on the board. (Reasons could include cost, the effects of smoking on the body, environmental damage, irritation to others and unattractive appearance.) Divide students into groups, assign each group to one of these topics, and have them brainstorm ways in which they could create an ad campaign for teens encouraging them not to smoke, focusing on this topic. Students might want to conduct some brief research to gather statistics or to look at current and past ad campaigns.



4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Each group, focusing on the topic brainstormed in class, creates two magazine or billboard ads geared toward teens encouraging them to quit or to not start smoking. Ads should be displayed around the school once they are complete.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Which do you think is a better reason not to smoke: the amount of money that would be saved, or the health risks involved in smoking?

–Which do you think makes for a better ad campaign: financial reasons, or health-related reasons for not smoking? Why do you think that is?

–How do you feel about current ad campaigns that try to convince kids not to smoke? Do you find them appealing? Convincing? Why or why not? How do you feel these campaigns could be made better?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based upon written journal entries, participation in class discussions, and thoughtful anti-smoking ad campaigns.

Vocabulary:

vital, likelihood, surveying, percent, decreased, substance, abuse, affect, public health, economics, tobacco, adhere, fundamental, principles, disposable, income

Extension Activities:

1. Survey smokers and potential smokers (including the teachers) at your school to determine whether a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes would affect their current smoking habits (or the possibility of their starting one). Include questions in your survey that would also help to determine what other factors people think would affect whether or not they quit, or start smoking, in the first place. Graph your survey results, and then share them with the class.



2. Create an ad campaign for a different “target group” (i.e. women, minority smokers, older smokers, etc.) to encourage them to stop, or to not start smoking. To do so, you will need to determine which factors might have more impact on these target groups that might not mean as much to teens.



3. Visit The Truth.com (//www.thetruth.com/main.cfm?fl=0) and compare its ad campaigns against smoking with the ones that you and your fellow classmates created. Also with the smoking-related public service announcements (PSAs) you have seen on television. Which ads do you find to have the most impact? Smallest or no impact? Select one of the ads at The Truth.com and one of the PSAs that you have seen on television and write a critique comparing the impacts of each.



4. Research some of the more modern techniques that people have tried to help them quit smoking, such as The Patch, Nicorette gum, acupuncture, hypnosis, and so on. Create a chart on which you list each of these methods, describing what it is, how it is supposed to work, and the comparative effectiveness of each. Post your chart on a wall of your classroom for others to see.



5. Read more about why RJ Reynolds decided to end its Joe Camel ad campaign (//gabrielmedia.org/news/joecamelexit.html). Then, in a round table discussion, discuss whether or not you think this ad campaign really had been geared toward young people and whether or not you think the company made the right decision by phasing it out.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Imagine that it is January 11, 1964 and the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, Luther L. Terry, M.D., has just released the first Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health. What does it say? What is the reaction of people to it? Research and write an article that might have been done on the topic at the time. Or, as an alternative, write a letter to Luther Terry, describing to him what effect this first Surgeon General’s Report had on American society and on the role that cigarettes play in it.



Civics- In 1997, RJ Reynolds and other tobacco companies agreed to a settlement with a coalition of states that had sued the tobacco companies to recover the costs of treating tobacco-related health problems. After researching more about ruling, and the final verdict, imagine that you are the judge and determine what you think would be an appropriate punishment, penalty or fine, for these tobacco companies. Then compare your decision with that of the actual settlement (//www.stic.neu.edu/settlement/6-20-settle.htm).



Economics- In addition to their association with tobacco products, the Philip Morris Companies are also the owners of Kraft Foods and the Miller Brewing Company. Research what products (other than cigarettes) they produce, what their corporate policies are, where else they put their corporate efforts, and other business-related information about them. Then create a company profile about them to share with your class.
