''Obviously the White House decided that the midterm elections were a serious matter and the substandard performance in the off-year elections this month wasn't going to cut it,'' said Scott Reed, a former executive director of the Republican National Committee.

The last time a Republican chairman resigned early in the presidential tenure of a member of his party was in 1982, when Richard Richards, President Ronald Reagan's first party chairman, quit after months of criticism that he had been ineffective as both a manager and a spokesman. And Mr. Richards lasted nearly two years, far longer than Mr. Gilmore.

Mr. Gilmore, 52, who is completing his term as governor, said in a recent interview that he had no intention of resigning as party chairman. In fact, he said he was eager to be even more involved in the party's daily operations once the governorship was behind him. ''I'm anxious to move ahead and to build this party,'' he said in the interview, on Nov. 8, two days after the election losses, adding that the job was ''a real joy to me.''

In a statement today, Mr. Gilmore cited personal reasons for his departure and did not mention the strife with the White House. ''As a full-time chairman of the R.N.C.,'' he said, ''I believe the demands on my time and the burden on my family is only going to increase over the next year.'' He said that since becoming chairman last winter, he had spent 107 nights away from home.

Officials in the party and at the White House said Mr. Gilmore was a strong-willed politician who had never learned that Mr. Rove expected to make the important decisions himself and rely on him only as a figurehead to raise money and appear on television. During his tenure, Mr. Gilmore had virtually no direct contact with Mr. Bush.
