As a result, ozone levels during the summer smog season in the state have dropped in the last 10 years. Unfortunately, however, it has been determined that emissions-control strategies have failed to attain the mandated air-quality standards.

The suggested reasons for this have been the continued growth of the economy here, increased use of our roads and interstate transportation of pollutants that originate in other states. In fact, the Federal Government has recently acknowledged that interstate transport is indeed affecting Connecticut's ability to meet air-quality standards. The urban areas of Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York contribute to the reduced air quality here. Last autumn, smoke from forest fires as far away as West Virginia and Kentucky reached our state.

Recognizing the factors of interstate transportation and the passage of the 1987 deadline, Congress and the E.P.A. are considering economic sanctions against states that do not comply with standards for acid-rain and ozone levels. Sanctions are not to be imposed on the states that demonstrate reasonable attempts to comply.

Certainly the D.E.P. and the citizens of Connecticut feel that the tropospheric-ozone problem is critical. We have demonstrated that we are willing to do what is necessary to insure good air quality. We also feel, however, that the E.P.A. must develop a clear national approach to reduce tropospheric ozone, a policy in which responsibility is distributed fairly and equitably. As it stands now, the E.P.A. policy calls for states to develop independently individual strategies to cope with problems that are, in reality, regional and interstate in nature.

Connecticut and the D.E.P. are ready to implement required measures to meet the goals of good air quality. We are ready to enhance inspection and maintenance controls of motor vehicles and of stationary sources of pollution. Also, and this will not be easy, we are ready to implement transportation controls, involving such measures as voluntary no-drive days, improving public transportation and incentives for ride sharing. Also, many federally mandated emissions programs will supplement Connecticut's strategies.

The citizens of Connecticut and the D.E.P. have proven that we understand the complexity of our world, the dangers that an unbalanced environment presents and that we must take responsibility for our own health and safety, as well as that of future generations. Further, we are willing to work cooperatively with other states and the Federal Government to bring about this objective.

On the other hand, we encourage the E.P.A. to reassess some proposals that do not take into account the true nature of the tropospheric-ozone problem. Tropospheric ozone is not something that can be dealt with state by state basis, but requires coordinated and balanced efforts on the part of all states involved. We in Connecticut are ready, as always, to do our part to achieve a clean and healthy environment.
