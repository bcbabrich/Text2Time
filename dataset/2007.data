Did I write last week’s column simply to provoke you?

The answer, of course, is no, though for a moment this week I found myself seriously wondering about it, as I re-read all your comments – 83 pages worth – in one long sitting.

The question wasn’t unreasonable. I had, after all, written my account of Rebecca Riley’s death with a particular straw person in mind: someone who would generalize from her story to say that it was emblematic of what was happening in a sick society where kids are being medicated to shut them up, make parents happy, and assure doctors of “quick fix” solutions to cultural ills that no one has any desire to cure.

Why did I seek to take that particular straw person on? And how did I know what he or she would be thinking?

It’s very simple: that person used to be me.

Some of you may perhaps recall that I used to sing a very different tune on the whole business of diagnosing and medicating children. It’s a topic I’ve come back to with some regularity, because as some of you know, I’ve been trying for the past three years to write a book on the mystery of why so many kids are being diagnosed with so many issues.

My book was initially supposed to be a kind of social reading of the culture of pathology in our time. You know what I mean: this world of A.D.D. and O.D.D. and G.A.D. and O.C.D. and P.D.D.* and bipolar disorder that has replaced the world of playground fights and bloody noses and kids sitting on the floor in the hallway after they’ve been kicked out of class that we all recall from our childhood. I was supposed to deconstruct this world – of “affluent parents and neurotic kids” as my contract put it – taking on “the overanalyzing, the overperfecting, the overpathologizing of America’s children” and raising questions “about the way an anxious culture reproduces itself.”

Some of you may find all this questionable. Even offensive. Parents of kids with “issues” generally do. In fact, when I was starting out with the book, a fair number of people, including good friends of mine whose children suffer from emotional, behavioral, learning or developmental difficulties, found my attitude – and my early postings here on the subject – just plain mean.

I didn’t see what was mean about them. I didn’t see what was offensive or objectionable, or even particularly opinionated. After all, there had been no end to the news stories bringing to light how the drug companies manipulate and mislead consumers. There was no refuting the fact that the field of research psychiatry, with its dependence upon Big Pharma for research grants, was profoundly corrupted. There was no question that doctors, pressured by managed-care companies and the demands of their own bottom line, were dispensing too many meds in too little time, asking too few questions, and providing parents and kids with too few real answers. I didn’t see what was debatable about the notion that kids were by and large being overdiagnosed and overmedicated; that doctors and parents and teachers and schools were taking the easy way out; and that all were turning a collective blind eye to the pathological aspects of our culture that were showing up as symptoms in our kids. It seemed obvious to me that our children were truly the canaries in the coal mine for our sick culture and that we were drugging them, in large part, to neutralize their cries for help and to “help” them more efficiently get with the program. That was what I set out to write about.

Most of you probably find that point of view appealing. Much more appealing, perhaps, than what I’ve been saying in recent weeks. But you see, there was a problem. That original book, tentatively titled “We’ve Got Issues: Childhood in the Age of Anxiety,” never got written.

For a long time I thought that it wasn’t getting written because I was too busy or too lazy or too scatterbrained to write it. But then I realized that it wasn’t getting written because it simply couldn’t be written. Its central argument was a tenable one in theory, but it crumbled in practice, when I ventured further than reading books and newspaper and magazine articles, and got beyond theory and started to talk to real people. To real parents who consistently told stories of how they’d painfully accepted labels and medications for their kids only after exhausting every other possible option, and to practitioners who often enough had themselves approached the whole issue of “flavor of the month” diagnoses like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder with skepticism, but had then come to see their validity – and the value of properly prescribed medication – from the weight of evidence they’d amassed in clinical practice.

I became aware, over time, that there was a name for people like me within the community of parents and doctors whose lives were consumed with treating children with A.D.H.D. and other issues: “naysayers.” I learned that we – the people who had no idea what it was like to parent a child with serious issues but found it easy to theorize and moralize and pontificate about the “abstract other” – were just one more burden that these parents and their children had to contend with in their already overburdened lives.

Do you know what life is like for parents whose children end up on medication? It’s not filled with annoyance because troublesome Junior has come along to wreck your years of childless fun. It’s filled with things like having your 6-year-old beg you to push him in front of a truck because he doesn’t want to live anymore. Or having your 8-year-old cry while she struggles through her homework, because her “brain is broken.” Or having your lovely 9-year-old start to do things like dump a plate of food on her head in the school cafeteria because, well, because everyone already thinks she’s the “weird kid” anyway. Parents who medicate have kids whose “antics” sometimes require calls to 911. For self-protection. Parents – most parents – who end up choosing to medicate do so because their kids are in serious pain.

Now, I’m not naïve. It is obvious that overdiagnosis and overmedication exist. Every doctor I’ve spoken with – even those who are most aggressive in wanting to raise awareness of disorders like A.D.H.D. and bipolar illness in kids – has said so. The practice of direct-to-consumer marketing is a scandal that has made serious mental illnesses banal and created an easy, overeager and underscrutinized market for serious drugs. And I do think that a certain portion of what is sometimes labeled as pathology in children can be attributed to poor parenting, poor schools and the pathological levels of stress and pressure that kids (and adults) now experience.

We live in a depressing, anxious-making and frenzied era; it’s no surprise that signs of depression, anxiety and overwhelmed distractibility are so widespread. But there’s a difference between people who exhibit these signs of distress under certain conditions and those who show consistent signs of disorder under all conditions. Overdiagnosis is surely happening within the former group. But the latter group, in many communities, actually remains underdiagnosed.

I now think that the worthwhile story to tell isn’t the one about the excesses of our era. It is rather about how, in this brave new world of diagnosis, medication, brain science, social services, educational reform, private consultants, support groups, Internet chat rooms and endless playground conversations about this or that nutritional therapy and this or that occupational therapy, parents of children with issues still find themselves so profoundly alone. With all the talk and all the therapy and the theorizing and the moralizing, we as a society are still failing them and their kids.

I’m going to leave you with a few questions:

What if children’s troublesome symptoms are not their truest form of self-expression?

What if, in the past, it really wasn’t so great to leave “quirky” kids to tough it out on their own?

What if recycling a watered-down version of ’60s-era radical thinking about psychiatry and the normalizing evils of mainstream society (“Mental illness is the revolt that the free organism in its total entity invents in order to live in an unbearable situation,” is how Jean-Paul Sartre once put it) isn’t the best approach to take in today’s world?

What if the whole topic deserves a new kind of radical rethinking?
