What I would like to do is borrow the beam for a week during the testing phase, before it is being used for power on earth, and send that beam out to the nearest star system. And in the beam I would place Starwisp, a very fine mesh of wires a mile across weighing less than an ounce. The microwaves would bounce off this mesh and give it a push toward the nearest star. It would accelerate very rapidly and it would reach 20 percent of the speed of light in a week, long before it left the solar system.

It would then coast to the nearest star. We now have a flying sail of chicken wire.

As it approached the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, by then we would have turned on the microwave beam again - of course, we would have to remember to turn out the beam four years earlier to get it there in time. We would enough microwave energy to power microcircuits in the wire mesh designed to put together a picture of the planets in the star system.

We will receive, four years later, pictures of television quality, in color, of the Alpha Centauri system as Starwisp flies through it. JAMES POWELL -

WHERE TO GET FUEL FOR STARSHIPS Interstellar flight does appear feasible, though difficult, at speeds maybe up to 10 to 20 percent the speed of light. If you want the energy to do this, you're going to need planetary scale robotic operations and one is optimistic that the technology could be available by the end of the 21st century.

Where do we get that kind of energy? Obviously we don't want to use up all of the energy we produce now on earth. To try to turn it into the amount we would need for a starship is impractical. There are some possibilities with large-scale planetary-type energy farms. One is solar factories on or in the orbit of Mercury; another is to do what the British group recommended doing which was mining helium 3 in Jupiter. There's probably a very large supply of it there. And that doesn't look too technically difficult. ISAAC ASIMOV -

YES, BUT SOCIETY WON'T PAY FOR IT Remember, it's the scientists and the astronauts who have the fun of designing and the fun of flying, but it's people who are going to be paying for this. If you're going to start building sails that are 1,000 kilometers across or building sources of power that make use of respectable fractions of the earth's annual output, or anything of that sort, it's going to cost quite a bit of money, and people, if they're going to spend that money, want to feel that they personally are going to get the use out of it. If you tell them here we are going to spend a trillion dollars and we're going to send somebody off and your great-grandchildren are going to get news of it, they're going to think of other things they can spend their trillion dollars on.

For one reason or another it may turn out that it won't be safe or practical to travel at more than an average speed of a tenth the speed of light, two-tenths at the most, so that it might take something like 40 years to reach Alpha Centauri and 40 years to come back. And I don't think that we're going to talk Earth's society into agreeing to such a trip. What does that mean? That interstellar flight is impossible? No, because I don't expect society to stay the way it is now. I expect it to change. It's got to change if we are going to explore the solar system.

So far, we've had a great deal of trouble expanding into space. We've been pretty successful but we've been at the ragged edge all the time. NASA has never had as much money as it needs. It has always had to cut corners. People are always a little disappointed that it's not all over yet. We reached the moon, didn't we? What else do we want? We're always glad to do things if they're reasonably cheap and if they bring back obvious benefits.
