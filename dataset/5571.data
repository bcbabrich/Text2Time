The Soviet Union said today that radioactive material was continuing to escape from a damaged nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, but that the chain reaction in the reactor had stopped.

Moscow said the emission of radioactive substances had decreased in the last 24 hours.

In its third statement in three days about the reactor accident, widely believed by Western authorities to be the worst in the history of nuclear power, Moscow denied Western reports that there had been thousands of casualties. It said 197 people had been hospitalized as a result of the accident, 49 of whom were discharged after examination. Soviet Reported 2 Deaths

On Tuesday the Government reported that two people had been killed and that four settlements around the reactor site had been evacuated.

The statement today called the Western reports of heavy casualties ''rumors,'' and a television commentator said the photograph of the plant should convince viewers that the damage had not been extensive. There was no mention of the barrage of criticism from Western governments over Moscow's reluctance to make more information about the accident public.
