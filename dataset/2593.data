Pico Central did not exactly have the fancy reputation that some of his Metropolitan Mile rivals enjoyed, but that may now change.

Lining up against one of the best fields assembled anywhere this year, one that included Funny Cide, the 2003 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, and Azeri, the 2002 horse of the year, Pico Central, a South American import, handled the tough assignment with relative ease.

Still perfect in four starts in the country after arriving from Brazil, where he was bred, Pico Central, a 5-year-old, scored a three-quarters-of-a-length victory yesterday in the $750,000 Metropolitan Mile at Belmont Park.

Funny Cide, who has lost six of eight starts since last year's Preakness, was fifth. Azeri, making her first start against stallions, was eighth in the nine-horse field.
