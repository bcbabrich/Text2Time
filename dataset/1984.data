About a month ago, the Denver Broncos’ starting cornerback Darrent Williams said he looked forward to returning to Fort Worth, Tex., in the off-season to warn young people in his hometown about staying away from violence and drugs. Williams never got home. Hours after the Broncos lost to the San Francisco 49ers to be knocked from the playoff race, Williams was shot to death in what the police said was a drive-by shooting in downtown Denver early on New Year’s Day.

Williams, 24, was riding in a stretch Hummer limousine early this morning when, just after 2 a.m., a vehicle pulled up beside the moving limousine and sprayed it with gunfire. Three people, including Williams, an unidentified man and an unidentified woman, were hit inside the limousine. The man, whom police said was not a Broncos player, was treated and released. The woman remained in the hospital, but her injuries are not considered life-threatening and the police said she will be released in a few days.

In a midday briefing Monday, held just feet from where the bullet-riddled Hummer remained after it veered into a snowbank after the shooting, the Denver police said that an argument broke out at a nightclub where Williams and others were attending a New Year’s Eve party. The club is a few blocks from the site of the shooting. The altercation was not directly between Williams and someone else, said the police spokesman Sonny Jackson, but between two groups of people — one of them Williams’s group — and did not involve a physical confrontation. The police spokesman said other people had been in the limousine but were not injured. He declined to identify them.

Several Denver-area news organizations reported that Broncos wide receiver Javon Walker was in the limousine. There were as many as a dozen bullet holes visible in the limousine and one window was blown out. The police are looking for a large white sports utility vehicle — a Suburban or Tahoe — with darkly tinted windows that they believe was involved in the shooting.

“We don’t believe that it’s random,” Jackson said.

The police do not believe any shots were fired from Williams’s limousine and they found no weapons inside the limousine, Jackson said.
