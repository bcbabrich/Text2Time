Valentina Iribagiza had a victim's-eye view of the 1994 massacre in Rwanda. For weeks, Valentina, a wounded 13-year-old, lay among the dead in the church where Tutsi villagers of Nyarubuye had sought refuge from their Hutu neighbors. Along with a few other orphaned children, she survived. ''Valentina's Nightmare'' is darkened with memories of parents, friends and babies stoned, clubbed and hacked to death in a four-day orgy.

Valentina told her story to Fergal Keane, a BBC correspondent, who brings it to ''Frontline'' tonight as an indictment of the West's refusal to intervene in what, he says, everyone recognized was genocide. Exhorted by the state radio -- ''All Tutsi will perish; slowly, slowly, slowly, we kill them like rats'' -- Hutu bands raged across the country, murdering hundreds of thousands of people. The result is glimpsed in the pictures of unburied corpses with which tonight's program begins.

This strong BBC report delivers some relevant background, beginning with Belgian rule after World War I, when the minority Tutsi served the colonial power as a sort of aristocracy. With Rwandan independence, tens of thousands of Tutsi were driven from the country. They returned in 1990 as a guerrilla army, and in 1993 a power-sharing arrangement was reached with the moderate Hutu President, Juvenal Habyarimana.

When he was killed in a plane crash in 1994, Hutu Tutsi-haters went on the rampage.

It was then, Mr. Keane charges, that the Western powers retreated from their responsibility under international law to act against genocide. ''Weary of African conflicts,'' he says, ''the West abandoned the Tutsis to their fate.'' A State Department spokeswoman is seen at a press briefing, speaking not flatly of genocide but only of ''acts of genocide,'' a legally ambiguous formulation.
