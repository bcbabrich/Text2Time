THE subject prefers poundcake or fresh fruit to a hot fudge sundae. Also, he likes Bartlett pears; cola; coffee and tea, both without cream and sugar; baked fish with sauce, and grilled chicken.

Having learned that, Steve Olson suggests: "You might enjoy semi-dry, rich wines aged in oak, such as big Bordeaux, Rhone, or Australian wines. Try some of the white wines in Category 4, or any of the reds in Category 4. A specific wine in the program that you might want to try is the Chateau Bages 1988."

Mr. Olson did not offer that advice in a book, or down at his Gramercy Tavern restaurant, but on a CD-ROM, Food & Wine's Wine Tasting: An Interactive Experience.

The program is divided into seven main categories: What Shapes a Wine; How to Taste Wine; Taster's Profile (the part with the hot fudge sundae); Wine Tastings; Personal Tasting Notes; Growing Regions, and Grape Varietals. Most of the major categories contain subcategories. Clicking on How to Taste Wine, for one, offers Introduction; How to Look; How to Smell; How to Taste; Recognizing Value, and Matching Food and Wine.
