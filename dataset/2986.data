THE PORTRAIT OF MRS. CHARBUQUE

I passed up the hansom cabs that Reed had waiting to ferry his guests home. Turning to my left, I set off south down Fifth Avenue, my head still spinning from the alcohol and Mrs. Reed's whispered desire. I pulled the collar of my coat up and the brim of my hat down, for it was as if summer had quietly expired at some point during the party. A stiff breeze blew down the avenue at my back, carrying past my left shoulder a sheet of yellowing newsprint that flapped and flew beneath the gas lamps like the fleeing ghost of that warm season. It was late, and I had many blocks to walk to my home on Gramercy Park, but I needed more than anything the air, the motion, the night, as an antidote to the staleness of the crowded parlor and the false, fractured light of that damnable chandelier.

The city streets were far from safe at that bleak hour, but it was a certainty that no matter how vicious an assailant I might meet, he could never be quite as insidiously dangerous as Reed. I shook my head at the thought of what his poor wife had been made to endure and how I had been a willing, albeit a somewhat unwitting, participant in her torture. What was evident to me now was that she had known all along what the game was. Most likely for the sake of her children, but also for her own survival, she had pretended to be enchanted by Reed's pretense.

If this was the first time, I doubted it would be the last, but now, with each future assault on her dignity, the charming, ageless beauty in my painting would forever bear witness to the increasing ugliness of her marriage and her life. That visage that was almost her, but not quite, was undoubtedly the woman her husband wanted. In truth, the real Mrs. Reed had more in common with the goldfish trapped in the bowl and the cut flowers left to wither in the ornate Chinese vase. I did not realize when I chose those props how telling they would prove to be.

Kim paced back and forth in front of the window of her office on 57th Street and Broadway. Below her, a panoramic view of Central Park opened up. Lulling her with peaceful scenes of rolling meadows and lush, robust trees swaying in the summer breeze. From her corner office on the 42nd floor, Kim could see all the way uptown to Turtle Pond, with its stone castle perched at the edge of a towering bluff overlooking the water.
