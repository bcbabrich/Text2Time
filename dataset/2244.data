Well, at least one, though there’s probably many more out there. Before today’s England-Portugal match I asked if we’d hear the word “Falklands” uttered if the English lost a game refereed by an Argentine. I think this qualifies as a winner. On Fox Soccer Channel’s “Ticket To Germany” tonight, the second English fan interviewed in Germany explained the outcome this way: “Argentinian ref. — not that we want to go into politics and stuff, but we’ve been cheated…. We were never going to win that, we could still be playing now, taking penalties and that referee wouldn’t have had it. Robbed, cheated, gutted. The Malvinas is ours and 1982 will be revisited tonight.”
