Rashard Casey, the Penn State quarterback, was cleared yesterday by a grand jury of charges that he had assaulted an off-duty police officer in Hoboken, N.J., last spring.

Casey still faces a civil suit by the officer, Patrick D. Fitzsimmons, who has not worked since the incident outside a nightclub last May 14. The police chief of Hoboken, Carmen LaBruno, also said yesterday that he would pursue the case against Casey on the federal level because, the chief said, the officer was the victim of a racial attack. Casey is black; Fitzsimmons is white.

Casey's lawyer, Dennis McAlevy, said yesterday that the bias charges had no chance at the federal level and that he would fight the civil suit. He said the decision not to indict Casey, made by a Hudson County grand jury, vindicated the quarterback.

''I talked to Rashard and he is certainly pleased with the decision made by the grand jury,'' McAlevy said. ''I knew he didn't do it. I am relieved for Rashard and his family. All's well that ends well.''
