Of all the people who populate the lane outside the kitchen window, the pole banger is the most insistent. But Rani, while she was there, was the most fetching. The street is not the same without her.

It is still lively enough. A constant stream of people hustle by. Pushcarts and ice-cream vendors and candy sellers make regular rounds. Occasionally an elephant lumbers by.

At night there is the pole banger. He is a night watchman who patrols the immediate streets, banging a big iron pole on the pavement as he goes - some also blow whistles - to scare criminals away.

But it is Rani's clan, three generations of hand-to-mouth working people, perhaps two dozen individuals in all, who spill out of the open-front dwelling cubicles across the way to take over the lane. Setting up string beds on both sides of the street, they convert it, village style, into a sitting room under the trees, where they banter, gossip, quarrel, hope, plan, sleep and suffer when sick.
