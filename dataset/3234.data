Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. List ways in which people “abuse” their bodies (in some way put their health at risk) and determine excuses that people use to support these “abuses;” assess how each “abuse and excuse” relates to beliefs or attitudes common in our society.

2. Explore why Americans failed to meet 2000 health goals and ways in which Americans can shape up to meet the 2010 goals by reading and discussing “On Health Report Card, the ‘F’ Stands for Fat.”

3. Understand how to use “A Picture of Health” food and exercise diary sheets to monitor and analyze their daily eating and exercise habits.

4. Maintain “A Picture of Health” food and exercise diary sheets for a week; evaluate their nutrition and exercise habits based on the week-long diary experience; propose ways in which they can improve their health.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-large sheets of paper (one per small group)

-markers (one per small group)

-paper

-pens/pencils

-copies of “On Health Report Card, the ‘F’ Stands for Fat” (one per student)

-copies of the worksheet “A Picture of Health” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/lessons/000201tuesday_ws.html) (seven per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, divide students into small groups of four, and give each group a large piece of paper and a marker. Students work together in their groups to respond to the following (written on the board prior to class): “Create two columns on your paper: one titled ‘Abuses’ and the other titled ‘Excuses.’ In the ‘Abuses’ column, list things that people do that in some way put their health at risk (including poor nutrition and doing or not doing specific activities). In the ‘Excuses’ column, list excuses that people use to support each ‘abuse.'” Each group then shares their work with the class. What common “Abuses” and “Excuses” did students list? How does each relate to beliefs or attitudes common in our society?

2. As a class, read and discuss “On Health Report Card, the ‘F’ Stands for Fat,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What was the purpose of the Healthy People 2000 report, and how were Americans successful and not successful with its goals?

b. If the report’s results assert that Americans are not leading very healthy lives, how is it possible that “centenarians are now the fastest growing segment of the population”?

c. What is the importance of exercise to health?

d. What statistics does the article use to support that Americans need to get more exercise?

e. What are the 2010 exercise goals?

f. What health benefits result from exercise?

g. What lifestyle activities seem to take people away from exercise?

h. What is the “five-a-day” program, and how do Americans fare on this health goal?

i. What are the 2010 nutrition goals?

j. What health benefits result from good nutrition?

k. How is it calculated whether or not someone is overweight?

l. What are the causes and health effects of being overweight?

m. Why are Americans seemingly becoming increasingly overweight? What statistics does the writer use to support this?

n. What statistics regarding smoking are offered in this article, and what are the 2010 goals?

o. Why is smoking included in this article that is predominantly about exercise and nutrition?

3. Distribute “A Picture of Health” food and exercise diary sheets so that each student has seven. Explain that over the course of the next week, students will be monitoring their food intake and exercise. Help students understand how to keep this diary by explaining the following:

–Students will be listing the exact food items that they eat over the course of the day, divided into meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks). It will be easiest if students fill out the “Foods Eaten” column immediately after each meal so that they will remember exactly what they have eaten.

–Caloric information for the meal and calculations of the percentage of carbohydrates, proteins and fats in the day’s diet can be figured on a separate sheet of paper and then entered into the appropriate boxes for each meal. For nutritional information, students can use CyberDiet’s food database (//www.CyberDiet.com/ni/htdocs/index.sht), nutritional information books, or other guides that you may find on the Internet. At the end of the day, these are added up and entered into the appropriate spaces on the “Daily Nutrition Totals” line. Students should figure out the percentages of their diet for the day comprised of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Many nutritionists feel that a “healthy” diet is comprised of 55% carbohydrates, 10% proteins, and 35% fats, although these numbers may vary based on the sources used.

–The four columns on the right side of the chart are to be used as a “checklist” of the number of servings of the five daily food groups consumed. For each meal, students tally into which columns their food intake belongs (for example, a turkey sandwich would count as two breads and one meat).

–For all exercise done during the day, students should note the activities, duration of each, and approximate calories burned. The NutriStrategy Web site provides a guide to calories burned during exercises and activities, based on your weight (//www.nutristrategy.com/activitylist4.htm).

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students complete the “A Picture of Health” food and exercise diary sheets each day for the next week. At the end of the week, ask students to write an evaluative piece about their food intake and exercise during the course of the week and proposals for ways in which they can improve their diet and exercise habits.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Do you think you maintain a healthy lifestyle? Why or why not? What could you do to improve your health?

–How are children’s diets affected by the recent trends in working parents and other time pressures on families?

–How would you define “nutritious”?

–How have fast food restaurants and frozen dinners affected the nutritional intake of Americans? How are some of these food products now becoming healthier?

–How do food and diet trends reflect other values and aspects of a society or culture?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial group work, participation in class discussions, completion of a seven-day diet and exercise journal, and reflective piece of writing analyzing the diet and exercise journal.

Vocabulary:

ambitious, objectives, centenarians, hale, sedentary, vigorous, longevity, rejuvenating, elite, antioxidants, debilitating, degeneration

Extension Activities:

1. Interview physical education teachers and coaches about how the physical education program in your school was designed and what its objectives are for each student. How has the emphasis on physical and health education changed over time, and why? Additionally, evaluate the nutrition of your school’s lunch program. Speak to the person responsible for ordering foods and planning menus, and learn about the required guidelines to which schools adhere.

2. Create a list of modern technologies and recreational activities popular today that may interfere with healthy eating and exercise habits (the article mentions increased time in front of the television set and computer). Then, list ways that people could continue to do these activities and also incorporate healthier habits.

3. Divide students into groups of three. Assign the groups the task of designing a menu for a healthy lunch. Groups list everything on their “lunch menu,” and then write a one-paragraph justification for why they feel that the choices they have made are healthy ones. Groups then share their menus and explanations of their choices. On the board, the teacher writes down the food items that the groups mention. When all groups have read their menus and explanations, discuss why similar items were listed. Then, ask students to explain which lunch is the one that they would most like to eat and why. How much does the taste of the food come into play in their answers?

4. Take an inventory of the food you have at home. What healthy foods do you find? What “unhealthy” foods do you find? What natural foods do you find?

5. Create a poster representing a nutritional information panel from a food package. Explain what each of the items and numbers means. Alternately, create a handbook or glossary defining and explaining the importance of different nutritional information terms (different types of vitamins and minerals, carbohydrates, different fats, starch, calorie, metabolism, protein, etc.).

6. Research diseases associated with poor nutrition and inadequate exercise, as well as foods thought to have preventative effects.

7. Learn about the body systems most closely associated with eating and exercise (skeletal-muscular and digestive systems). Create a “How It Works” poster describing the effects of proper and improper nutrition and exercise on these body systems.

8. Learn about various diets that are currently popular. What do these diets claim to do, and how do they work? Do you think that any of these diets are unsafe, and why?

9. Interview a doctor or nutritionist about healthy eating and exercise habits for people of different ages.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research the changes in occupations in American society over the past 100 years and evaluate how these changes have affected the health of people over the course of this time period.

Geography- Investigate the diets of different cultures and the diseases that are or are not common in those cultures due to the specific diet.

Language Arts- Develop a persuasive poster campaign encouraging students in your school to adopt better eating and exercise habits.

Mathematics

-Compare the nutritional information from some of your favorite packaged foods with the recommended daily allowances for various nutrients, and create graphs illustrating your findings. Are these foods “nutritious”? Why or why not? Are some of the foods that claim to be more nutritious than others being honest in their claims, and why?

-Analyze and graph statistical information about the smoking patterns of people under the age of 18 in the United States. A tremendous number of useful and interesting graphs are provided on the American Lung Association Web site (//www.lungusa.org/index2.html) under “Data & Statistics” on the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.

Media Studies

-Analyze ads for different foods. What foods are described as “healthy” and why? Then, “test” these foods against the recommended daily allowance to determine whether or not the foods are truly nutritious.

-Assess how the media portrays what is “healthy,” both in appearance and actions. How do these portrayals affect the viewing public? Are any of the portrayals dangerous, and if so, how?
