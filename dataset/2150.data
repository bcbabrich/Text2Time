Some of the most passion-inducing figures in contemporary politics are booked on this Sunday’s talk shows.

Karl Rove, President Bush’s erstwhile “architect,” will be on “Fox News Sunday.” He recently sparked controversy by saying that it was Congress — not the White House — that wanted to rush a vote on the use of force authorization in Iraq. Representative Chris Van Hollen, who, as the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, hopes to be the architect of an expanded Democratic majority, is also set to appear.

Senator Jim Webb, the Virginia Democrat known for his passionate statements about the war (sometimes to the president, you might recall) will be on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Several candidates are set to appear: Senator John McCain on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Mike Huckabee on ABC’s “This Week” and Representative Ron Paul and Senator Christopher J. Dodd on CNN’s “Late Edition.” Two of the top candidates’ strategists, David Axelrod of the Barack Obama campaign and Howard Wolfson, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s spokesman, will also face Bob Schieffer.

Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, likely fuming about the Democratic National Committee’s vote to strip his state of delegates, will also be on CNN, as will Senator Arlen Specter and Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, commander of the Multinational Corps in Iraq.
