AROUND THE WORLD; Nuclear Powers Urged To Forgo 'First Use'

MOSCOW, Sept. 30 (Reuters) - A group of Soviet and British political and military experts called on nuclear powers today to follow the Soviet lead in pledging not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, and recommended that the principle be extended to include conventional arms.

Members of the group, which included Field Marshal Lord Carver and Gen. Konstantin Mikhailov, said at a news conference that both sides felt urgent steps were needed to counter a growing threat of nuclear war.

The group's three-day talks in Moscow were the third in a series of so-called ''Edinburgh conversations'' between Soviet and British experts on the danger of a new war. It was the first such meeting held in the Soviet capital.

GENEVA, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The United States and the Soviet Union resumed talks today on reducing the number of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. The Soviet negotiator, Yuli A. Kvitsinsky, said after he arrived here on Tuesday that it was up to the United States to act in the 10-month-long negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces.
