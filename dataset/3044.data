The Philadelphia Eagles do not even try to make excuses for two games against the Giants this season, ones in which they were badly outplayed and outscored.

''Frankly, they just flat-out beat us twice,'' receiver Charles Johnson said.

But the Eagles, who defeated Tampa Bay, 21-3, today in a National Football Conference wild-card game, also contend that, in their current state of ascendancy, they bear no resemblance to the team that was manhandled, 33-18 and 24-7, by the Giants, whom they will face again next Sunday.

''We are a much different, much more confident team,'' free safety Brian Dawkins said. ''For some reason, we were tight in those games. We have to let our emotions show. They can watch all the old film they want. This is a completely different team.''

By now the ritual has become as predictable and tired as ''Who Let the Dogs Out?'' The Eagles face the Giants and they lose. They have lost eight in a row to the Giants, never winning a head-to-head matchup since Jim Fassel became coach.
