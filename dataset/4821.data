Mr. Bush, who announced on Tuesday that he would ask Congress to approve favorable new trade terms for the Soviets, continued to press for economic reform as a condition for large-scale United States assistance.

"You must define your own branch of democratic capitalism," he told an attentive group of fledgling Soviet businessmen in a breakfast speech. "People must be free -- to work, to save, to own their own homes, to take risks, to invest in each other and, in esssence, to control their own lives."

Mr. Gorbachev, for his part, has been pressing the United States to ease restrictions on high-technology exports to the Soviet Union.

The two leaders spent much of the day at a government retreat 20 miles west of Moscow, known as Novo Ogaryevo, discussing political issues that still divide their nations. On the agenda were Cuba, the size of the Kremlin military budget and the Baltic republics' desire to be independent. There was no indication that the talks were anything but cordial, and Soviet television showed the two leaders smiling, tieless and wearing pullover sweaters.

But what made this week "a dramatic time," as Mr. Gorbachev put it, was the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, and its symbolic termination of the race by the United States and the Soviet Union to amass weaponry with which to blow each other up.

Start will reduce the superpowers' stocks of long-range missiles and bombers by about a third. But that will take them back only to roughly the level where they stood as negotiations began in Geneva in 1982 on this, the last of the major arms-control agreements conceived in the tensions of the 1970's and 1980's.

Nonetheless, it is the first agreement ever that calls for the two nations actually to reduce their holdings of the most deadly weapons, instead of merely reducing the rate at which those holdings have expanded.
