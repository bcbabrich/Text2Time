The Boston Herald says the condo boom hasn’t completely expired in Boston. It notes a project to convert buildings in that city’s Chinatown into condos.

Already concerned with a wave of new luxury towers that are steadily encroaching on the neighborhood, housing activists contend that Choi’s project takes the transformation to a new level. The move will bring an end to a popular second-floor food court featuring low-cost, local eateries. “This is a big part of history,” said Kevin Chan, 21, who started eating at the food court as a small boy. “There aren’t that many cheap places to eat.”
