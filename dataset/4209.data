A 12,500-square-foot center for the performing arts has opened in downtown Indianapolis. The Indianapolis Artsgarden, with seating for 400, rises into a 95-foot-high dome and is connected by covered catwalks to the new Circle Center retail and entertainment complex. The design architects for the Artsgarden and the center were Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut Architects of New York.

Regular programming at the Arts garden, which was financed by the Lilly Endowment, will include visual arts and craft exhibitions, music, dance and theater, films, lectures and festivals.

Among the events already scheduled are a free Tuesday-night Twilight Performance series in which Indianapolis arts groups will offer previews of performances; an Artists-in-Residence series that opens Oct. 14 with exhibits by a local sculptor, Kevin Robert Leslie, and a monthlong African-American Arts Festival next February.

Opening hours for the Artsgarden, at Illinois and Washington Streets, are Monday to Saturday from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Sunday from noon to 6 P.M.
