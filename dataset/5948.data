Rick Monday's grand-slam home run in the eighth inning broke up a scoreless pitching duel tonight and gave the Los Angeles Dodgers a 4-0 victory over the San Francisco Giants.

The Dodgers remained one game behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. The Giants are now two games behind. All three teams have two games remaining.

Monday's homer, over the right-center field fence, was his 11th of the season. It came after a walk, a single by Dusty Baker and another walk loaded the bases with one out.

Jerry Reuss (18-11) went the route, holding the Giants to three hits, for his fourth shutout of the year. Fred Breining (11-6), the Giants' starter, took the loss before the largest crowd of the season at Candlestick Park, 53,281.
