In his first time at bat against Darwin, Strawberry led off the second inning with a single to left. He raced to third as Johnson singled to right and he scored on Gary Carter's fly to left.

The third time he went to the plate, in the fifth inning, Strawberry tripled and triggered a three-run burst. He scored on Johnson's sacrifice fly, and Bobby Ojeda later singled home two runs after Magadan stroked his third single and Kevin Elster doubled.

Having hit a single, a home run and a triple in his first three tries, Strawberry had a chance to become only the fifth player in Mets' history to hit for the cycle. (No, he said, if he had hit another home run, he would not have stopped at second.) No Double for Strawberry However, he never got the double. He grounded to second in the sixth inning and was walked in the eighth after McReynolds doubled Dykstra home and Wally Backman to third. McReynolds had hit a home run in the sixth.

The 12-run, 16-hit attack was enough to give Ojeda only his second victory in his last eight starts. Ojeda's performance, though, was mixed. The left-hander held the Astros without a hit until two were out in the fifth inning, but in the eighth inning he was unable to maintain a six-run lead and required relief.

The Astros actually scored their first run without a hit. With the Mets ahead, 4-0, and one out in the fifth, Ojeda walked Henderson. Craig Biggio, the Astros' rookie catcher from Seton Hall, then hit a grounder to third base, and Howard Johnson, trying for a force at second, threw the ball into right field.

Henderson went to third on the error and scored on Darwin's fly to right. It was then that the Astros got their first hit. Billy Hatcher rapped a double to center field, and Biggio scored the second run. Trouble for Ojeda

A hit by Hatcher caused trouble for Ojeda in the eighth inning, too. It was a leadoff single, and Rafael Ramirez followed with a double to right. Ojeda struck out Bill Doran and retired Glenn Davis on a soft liner to second, but Kevin Bass lined a hard single to center, driving in both runners and reducing the Mets' lead to 8-4.

After Ojeda walked Buddy Bell, Manager Johnson summoned Terry Leach, and he ended the rally by getting Terry Puhl, a pinch-hitter, on a line drive to short.
