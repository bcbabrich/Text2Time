Terra Lycos, the Internet arm of the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica, is considering the sale of the Internet portal Lycos US as part of a strategic shift in its operations but ''no definitive decision has been made,'' said Telefónica's chairman, César Alierta, left, at a shareholders meeting, in answer to rumors about a sale. ''Terra networks is currently undergoing a process of analysis and revision of select operative units,'' a regulatory filing with the Spanish stock market commission said. Telefónica bought Lycos US in 2000 for 12.56 billion euros, but since then, the company's value has shrunk sharply, a company spokesman said. Telefónica is bolstering its Spanish- and Portuguese-language operations, as evidenced by the purchase in the works of all Bell South's assets in Latin America, Mr. Alierta said. Telefónica will nearly double its stake in its Portuguese partner, Portugal Telecom, from 4.7 percent to 8.17 percent, he added. Dale Fuchs (NYT)
