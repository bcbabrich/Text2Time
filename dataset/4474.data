In a disagreement with New Jersey's management over the direction the team ought to take, Herb Brooks resigned as coach yesterday after fulfilling one season of the three-year contract he was given last June 5 to "take the Devils to the next level."

Brooks, whose team (40-37-7) tied the Islanders for third place in the Patrick Division but was eliminated in five games by Pittsburgh in the first round of the playoffs, wanted the Devils to, in effect, take a step backward before going forward. The 55-year-old coach viewed youth and speed as the main ingredients for building success. Management felt the players on the team were good enough to become Stanley Cup contenders.

In announcing Brooks's resignation yesterday, Lou Lamoriello, the president and general manager of the Devils, made it clear that Brooks "was not fired."

Lamoriello didn't appear to be upset that the man he had brought in to make the Devils one of the league's elite teams was no longer with the organization. But it was obvious he was upset about the way Brooks's resignation came to light. Accused of Loose Lip
