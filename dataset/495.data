After nine years in jail and three trials without a verdict, a Bronx man pleaded guilty to manslaughter on Monday in a 2007 murder, a move that closes New York City’s longest unresolved case.

The man, Carlos Vega, 33, accepted the plea deal in a Bronx courtroom in exchange for a 12 ½-year sentence and, based on the time he has served, could leave jail in about a year.

Mr. Vega was accused of fatally shooting Robert Gaston, 34, in a Bronx bodega on Sept. 29, 2007. Mr. Vega was detained just 30 minutes after the shooting, but the case has dragged on through years of adjournments and three trials. The city’s criminal justice system is notorious for its slow pace, but Mr. Vega’s case is an extreme example of how much worse the problem is in the Bronx.
