Miners reported for work as usual today at some A.T. Massey Coal Company mines in southern West Virginia, although their contract expired and negotiators failed to reach agreement on a new one with the independent operator.

A.T. Massey was one of three major independent producers that would not go along with a new contract between the United Mine Workers and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.

A union official said miners working for the three independent companies were told by telegram to proceed with strikes.

The other major coal producers targeted for selective strikes were the National Mining Corporation and the Pittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Company of Denver, Colo.
