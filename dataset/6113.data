LONDON—Tongsun Park, the central figure in the sweeping investigation of South Korea's alleged influence buying in Washington, gave $190,000 to Otto Passuran, one of the most powerful members of the House of Representatives until his defeat for a 16th term last year, according to sources here who are close to Mr. Park.

The sources, close friends and associaces who said they had direct knowledge of the payments, said the money was the largest amount that Mr. Park gave to any Congressman and was intended to obtain Mr. Passman's support for the South Korean Government and for Mr. Park's own business friendships.

[Mr. Passman, reached Tuesday by telephone at his office in Monroe, La., said: “I'm 77 years old and served in the Congress for 30 years. I have never received a dime from Mr. Park or any other foreign national. How these things get out, I don't know.”]

Mr. Passman's name has previously figured in the Tongsun Park investigations, but these are the first allegations that the former Democratic Representative received substantial amounts of money from Mr. Park.
