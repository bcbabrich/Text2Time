Best Buy said yesterday that it expected major suppliers to begin attaching radio identification tags to cartons and pallets of goods shipped to it, starting Jan. 2, 2006. It expects all such shipments from the suppliers to be tagged by May 2007. Best Buy, a 750-store electronics and entertainment products chain based in Minneapolis, said its radio identification system would use E.P.C. standards, a form of the technology that Wal-Mart and the Department of Defense have already specified for suppliers. The company said it planned tests in stores and distribution centers before the introduction. Best Buy indicated that its short-term goals were to speed products through its supply chain and reduce instances of products that customers want being out of stock. But the company said it was also interested in the technology's potential to help with tasks like processing warranty claims and returns, which would require leaving the radio tags on products when they are sold. That use of the technology is strongly opposed by consumer privacy advocates. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)
