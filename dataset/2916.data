WHEN Stephen Sondheim extolled the virtues of ''the little things you do together'' in the musical ''Company,'' eating candy was nowhere on the list. Now Mars, the confectionery giant that makes Milky Way, is revamping the brand's advertising in most markets around the world to promote the candy bar as one of life's small delights.

In a campaign that begins today in the United States and in May in Britain and Europe, offices of Grey Worldwide, the brand's new agency, are asserting that it provides ''Pleasure you can't measure.''

The American part of the campaign features television commercials comparing Milky Way to momentary thrills that deliver frissons of good feelings. Among them: reaching that itchy spot with a back scratcher, breaking the bubbles in shrink wrap with a satisfying popping sound, making a friend's hair stand on end with a balloon and watching a car odometer turn over from 99,999 miles.

Those pleasures are perhaps minuscule to the point of invisibility. But when consumers have long since learned to ignore or even mock the hyperbole of advertising, offering a scaled-down, easily delivered benefit may be no small feat. That is particularly true when seeking to stimulate sales for venerable brands like Milky Way, because breathlessly Bunyanesque claims are less likely to be believable with familiar products.
