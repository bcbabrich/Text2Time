To the Editor:

As outlined in ''A New Beginning in Kenya'' (editorial, Dec. 31), fighting corruption, expanding education and improving health care should certainly be priorities of Mwai Kibaki, the newly elected Kenyan president.

But it is important to avoid neglecting what is perhaps the greatest contemporary concern in Kenya: the country has become a hotbed of international terrorism.

The attacks on the United States Embassy and, more recently, against targets identified with Israelis are evidence of a thriving network of terrorist operatives in Kenya.

The international community would be wise to work closely with Mr. Kibaki to frustrate the intentions and efforts of terrorists seeking to strike in the region, and to dismantle any existing terrorist infrastructure.
