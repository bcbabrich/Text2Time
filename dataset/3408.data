PG 114 minutes

In the misty Tanzanian high country, a little girl named Jill witnesses the murder of her mother, a Jane Goodall-type researcher, by Strasser (Mr. Sherbedgia), a poacher who has also just blasted a mother gorilla so he can cart off Joe, her valuable baby.

Joe eludes him. Twelve years later, he stands 15 feet high, weighs 2,000 pounds and needs inordinate quantities of foliage to stay fed and hidden away from promoters who would make a latter-day mini-King Kong of him. Ever by his side, Jill (Ms. Theron), now a willowy young woman (and a foxy one considering all the years she has spent entirely in the jungle), keeps him sequestered and humored with games of hide-and-seek.

But this being a remake of Ernest B. Schoedsack's 1949 film, Joe, who's really a sweet lug at heart, is destined for the bright lights. A well-meaning zoologist (Mr. Paxton) persuades Jill to pack Joe off to Los Angeles for a supposedly protected existence in a game preserve. Still bent on appropriating the gorilla for himself, Strasser follows and purposely riles him up.

After scattering the well-heeled assemblage at a charity event, Joe takes to the streets for a halfhearted rampage. Later he redeems himself by rescuing a child, but maybe Los Angeles wasn't such a good idea after all. An admiring public takes up a collection to set Joe up properly back home.

VIOLENCE The killing of Joe's mother and Jill's will scare many small children, an odd thing to do in a movie whose principal audience is the very young. Strasser is graphically the worse for wear after Joe flings him onto some power lines, but while other mayhem yields injuries, nothing is visibly too serious.

SEX Jill and the zoologist haltingly try a kiss or two.

PROFANITY None.

For Which Children?

AGES 3-5 They will love Joe, who's just a little kid himself. With parental pointers, they should also basically understand what is going on. With the exception of matricide and Joe's outbursts, which are messy but not all that menacing, the film rigorously stays as cuddly as possible.
