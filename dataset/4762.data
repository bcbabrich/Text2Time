To the Editor:

I was pleased to read in "Census Finds Many Claiming New Identity: Indian" (front page, March 5) that more American Indians are no longer ashamed of their heritage, and American society is at last "accepting and admiring the Indian heritage." Such recognition is long overdue. In April 1988, you reported incidents of racial epithets hurled at Chippewa Indians in northern Wisconsin by "sportsmen" for fishing with spears to supplement their food supply and income. The sportsmen said this gave the Indian an unfair advantage.

It's not the first time the American Indian has been attacked for exercising his birthrights. As a Navajo Indian with whom I once served mused, "We used to own the place, and now you let us live on it."

The 46th anniversary of the bloody World War II battle of Okinawa in the Pacific Ocean comes up April 1. Too few people realize that Navajo Indians, who volunteered to serve their country, contributed immeasurably to the success of this invasion and that of Iwo Jima on Feb. 19, 1945, with their "code talk."

Navajo code talkers on each end of a communication line or radio would pass on commands in their native tongue, saving precious time and lives by eliminating the need to code and decode during the height of combat, confusing the Japanese, who could not break the code. Their accuracy is legendary, yet these Navajo warriors were given little recognition, so little that the Fourth Marine Division Association on its own had a commemorative medal struck honoring the American Indian Marine.
