WASHINGTON, May 1—The United States and China have begun unpublicized negotiations in Washington to settle financial claims between the two countries—a necessary step toward the establishment of normal trade relations.

Administration officials disclosed today that the talks had been conducted over the last several weeks by William H. Gleysteen Jr., the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, and Han Hsu, the deputy chief of the Chinese Liaison Office here.

However, despite the declared willingness of both sides to discuss the highly complex problem, involving some $80 million in blocked Chinese assets and American claims of $200 million, officials said that no breakthrough was near and that it might take a long time to reach an agreement.

These are the Carter Administration's first important negotiations with the Chinese to become public and they are in keeping with the President's declared wish to normalize relations.
