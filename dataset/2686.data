The chairman of the city's Campaign Finance Board yesterday criticized Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to sharply curtail campaign contributions from people who do business with the city.

In his first public comments on the issue, the board chairman, Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., testified against the proposed legislation at a City Council hearing, saying that while he supported its larger goal, he felt it was "the wrong way" to deal with the problem.

The mayor's plan would limit contributions from such sources to $250 for candidates who receive public money from the campaign finance program. The current limits are $2,750 in races for the Council, $3,850 for borough president, and $4,950 for mayor, comptroller and public advocate. The plan would also eliminate matching public money for contributions from those sources.

Mr. Schwarz said yesterday that the ban should apply to all candidates and not just those in the voluntary campaign finance program. "It's a citywide problem, and it ought to apply to everyone running for office," he said.
