Advocates of school decentralization here reacted with dismay and sadness to Dr. Kenneth B. Clark's announcement before the Temporary State Charter Revision Commission for New York City that he had become a “vehement foe” of decentralization.

“I think Ken is expressing as usual his deep frustration about the progress of education,” said David Seeley, director of the Public Education Association. “But even more disastrous would be to try to return to a centralized body which for a period of 20 years showed itself increasingly unable to cope with the problems.”

Dr. Clark, one of the early advocates of school decentralization, told the commission in private testimony that decentralization had become a “disastrous” experiment in which the basic issue—teaching children—had beed subordinated to “racial politics.”

While not advocating a return to the old centralized school system, Dr. Clark, a professor of psychology at City College and a member of the State Board of Regents, warned Against a “simplistic manipulation of the bureaucratic structure.”
