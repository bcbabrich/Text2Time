Q. Do hate crime laws infringe upon free speech?

A. It's something we are very sensitive to at A.D.L. because basically we are vigorous proponents of free speech and defenders of general First Amendment rights. What is at issue here is not speech but action. What we are talking about is someone who commits a crime and then takes action in selecting that victim because of who the person is, their religion, the color of their skin, their ethnicity, their sexual orientation.

Our position is that anybody has a right to think whatever they want no matter how much we may dislike it, including the Ku Klux Klan. The question is when you commit a crime, such as an assault, battery or threatening somebody or an arson or vandalism, you are selecting your victim. Selection is an action, not a thought. A.D.L. has been the driving force behind hate crime laws around the country.

Q. Are Connecticut country clubs restricted against Jewish membership?

A. We have information from a variety of areas where there continue to be restrictions on Jewish membership. I'm not aware of any instance where there are formal restrictions, where it's in a club's bylaws, but there are informal restrictions. Actually that's something we're interested in knowing more about.

There are different values in conflict here. On the one hand you have people's right of association. People say I want my own kind in the club. Shouldn't people be allowed to make those kind of choices in a private environment? Many people who grow up in that environment will have leadership positions in our society. One of the things young people learn by being in a restricted environment is that the kind of separation, segregation, exclusion that goes on in those environments is permissible, is acceptable. Those are values that people implicitly learn who grow up in clubs like that even if a derogatory word is never mentioned. That is one of the things that makes that private club discrimination so dangerous and so insidious.

Are private clubs exclusively private? They are subject to some government largesse. For example, you get liquor licenses and certain tax benefits.

There is also a standard use of clubs for business purposes even if clubs say it should not happen. Many businesses pay for club memberships. If you can't go there you are being placed at a decided disadvantage.

Q. Is the Ku Klux Klan actively recruiting in Connecticut?

A. The Klan has been active in Connecticut in a perpetual recruitment drive. They are a little more sophisticated than in the past. The Klan pays more attention to how it packages itself. David Duke is a classic example. Here you have a guy that got rid of the hood and the robe and put on a business suit and got an attache case.
