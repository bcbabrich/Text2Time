Any monetary damages or other remedies will be determined in subsequent hearings before Mr. Nicolau. Mr. Roberts is now hearing the remedy phase of the first collusion case. Lawyers estimate that if the two arbitrators accept the players' arguments, they could award damages in the area of $75 million.

Barry Rona, executive director of the owners' Player Relations Committee, noted that the events covered in the Nicolau decision occurred before the clubs received Mr. Roberts's ruling in the 1985 case. Immediately after the first decision, Mr. Rona said, the clubs, although they disagreed with it, said they would comply with the decision. The union filed a grievance charging continued collusion in 1987, and Mr. Nicolau is hearing that case now. Prominent Players Affected

In his decision, Mr. Nicolau said the clubs' lack of interest in the group of 79 free agents after the 1986 season could not be attributed to individual actions. The group included prominent players like Andre Dawson, Tim Raines, Jack Morris, Lance Parrish, Willie Randolph and Ron Guidry.

''What transpired in 1986,'' Mr. Nicolau wrote, ''occurred because everyone 'understood' what was to be done. By common consent, exclusive negotiating rights were, in effect, ceded to former clubs. There was no vestige of a free market, as that term is commonly understood. The object was to force players back to their former clubs and the expectation was that all would go back in a replication of 1985, requiring nothing more to be done.''

The arbitrator flatly rejected the owners' contention that their 1986 behavior differed from the previous year's because there was significant bidding activity for some free agents. That contention, he said, is ''contrary to the evidence and insupportable.'' 39 Days of Hearings The evidence presented during 39 days of hearings over seven months, Mr. Nicolau went on, ''convincingly establishes that everyone knew there was to be no bidding'' for free agents as long as their former clubs ''coveted'' them. Then, in a litany of specific examples involving various clubs and players, Mr. Nicolau wrote:

''Surely John McHale of the Expos knew . . . Eisenhardt of the A's surely knew . . . Surely Giles knew . . . Surely Green knew . . . Kasten, the Braves' president, surely knew . . . ''
