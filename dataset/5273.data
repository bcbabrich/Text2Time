Gray-market goods, also called ''parallel imports,'' are typically trademarked, authentic foreign-made products, like Nikon cameras and Seiko watches, that independent discount retailers buy from overseas suppliers at low prices. The retailers sell them in the United States without the consent of the owners of the American trademarks, many of which are distributors affiliated with the foreign manufacturers.

In the decision today, by two differently constituted 5-to-4 majorities, the Court upheld a provision of the Customs Service regulation that allows gray-market imports over the objections of United States trademark owners that are affiliated, under common ownership or control, with the foreign companies that manufacture the goods.

The Court struck down another, less significant provision of the regulation, affecting cases in which American companies license independent foreign manufacturers to use their trademarks only for sales overseas.

Among the winners in the case, who persuaded the Court to overturn a Federal appellate ruling that the gray market was illegal, were the K Mart Corporation and 47th Street Photo Inc. They sell at discounts trademarked foreign goods that they import through the gray market, in competition with the authorized distributors of the foreign manufacturers of those goods.

The losers included an association of the United States affilates of foreign companies that seek to use their trademark rights to ban competition from gray market imports of goods sold overseas by the foreign companies, as well as some United States manufacturers. One such American company is Duracell Inc., a Kraft Inc. subsidiary that make goods abroad through subsidiaries and sell them both overseas and in the United States.

The association, called the Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American Trademarks, argued unsuccessfully that the gray market and the Customs Service provisions that allow it violated their rights under a 1922 law that, they said, banned importation of trademarked foreign goods without the consent of the holder of the United States trademark. No Reliable Statistics

Government and other experts say there are no reliable statistics on the size of the gray market. Justice William J. Brennan Jr.'s separate opinion called it a ''multibillion-dollar industry'' and an ''immense domestic retail industry.'' Most estimates put it at from $5 billion to $10 billion a year in total sales.
