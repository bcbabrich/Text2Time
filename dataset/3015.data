''What you've got to do is fight through that stuff as best you can,'' Marcin said. ''But it gets tough after a while.''

Strahan mused about the possibility of retaliating in forthcoming games. ''But I know if I punched him in the face, I'll get called for it,'' Strahan said, referring to opposing linemen. ''If the offensive guy does it, nothing is called. It's not a fair society, I guess.''

The other Giants linemen review game tape every week, and they say they are amazed at what opposing teams have done against Strahan without being flagged. Matt Mitrione, a reserve defensive tackle, said that on one play, a lineman yanked Strahan to the ground by his shoulder pad, as a running back blocked into the back of Strahan's leg. ''He gets abused,'' Mitrione said.

Kenny Holmes, the Giants' other defensive end, said: ''He's a great player, and people are going to do everything they can to get him out of his game. Cheap shots and a lot the other stuff isn't called, and you can go back and review the film and see all this stuff. Heck, yeah, there's a lot of it.''

Marcin said Strahan has been good about keeping his concentration, rather than being distracted by what he believes are missed calls. ''Once in a while he'll show some frustration out there, go up to the referee and say something,'' Marcin said. ''But for the most part, he knows it's part of the game and part of what's going to happen to him every game. You just go on with it and live with it and hopefully we'll get some things that go our way.''

EXTRA POINTS

Receiver IKE HILLIARD will miss the rest of the season because of a dislocated right shoulder, but in a strange way, the injury could increase the chances that he will return to the Giants after becoming a free agent. Hilliard has had major injuries to his neck, right big toe and shoulder that might concern other organizations and limit their bidding for him, but the Giants would welcome back Hilliard enthusiastically so long as club executives feel they can fit his salary within their salary-cap structure. . . . Guards DUSTY ZEIGLER (knee) and RICH SEUBERT (back) missed practice today, and although Seubert will most likely play against Jacksonville, JASON WHITTLE -- who is coming back from a back injury -- could replace Zeigler. TAM HOPKINS is also a possibility.
