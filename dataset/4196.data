And occasionally humans and animals actually merge identities, as in a set of Tang period statuettes of astrological signs. In each, the upright body is dressed in flowing court robes. But the heads are those of animals, real and imaginary, from a truculent dragon with a snout like a shoe to an ape whose look of somnolent self-satisfaction could be transferred straight into an Alice in Wonderland illustration by John Tenniel.

The human connection has distinct ethical implications in three monkeys carved on a Chinese tobacco holder. By the late 19th or early 20th century, when this object was made, the familiar "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" emblem was a reminder to keep one's own counsel in the midst of intrigue. But it had far grander origins as a Buddhist metaphor for the ideal of detachment from the world of the senses.

Buddhism is central to the work in the show's last and largest section, "Monkeys as Intermediaries Between the Human and the Divine." In a Ching period Chinese sculpture cut from milk-white stone, a companionable little ape shares a Buddhist monk's woodland solitude. And in a painting from eastern Tibet, the Buddha himself is shown in an earlier life as a self-sacrificing monkey who uses his body as a bridge to let his companions escape from hunters.

A monkey is also one of the great heroes of Hinduism. In the Sanskrit epic "Ramayana," the warrior Hanuman is a paradigm of fidelity and valor, and he is still a much-loved figure throughout India today, carried in processions, featured in films and worshiped in the form of abstract, vermilion-painted moundlike icons in village shrines. At the Asia Society, he appears as two spectacular Indian sculptures. In one, a superb 11th-century Chola Dynasty bronze on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he leans with princely deference toward the figure, now missing, of the god Rama, whom he served. In another, which -- judging by its size -- would once have graced the walls of an immense stone temple, his body twists in a vivacious dance.

Just such a temple appears in a time-faded 18th-century gouache on paper. Its central image is a characteristic Indian structure: a gradually tapering pyramid, towering many stories into the sky, its exterior pristinely whitewashed like that of the Puri temple, a black lingam or symbol of Shiva enshrined in its sanctuary. It takes a minute to register the odd details in the picture. There are no gods or heroes -- not even a Hanuman -- ornamenting its facade, just the statues of two identical golden monkeys, as alike as bookends, flanking its summit. And in place of streams of human devotees, monkeys fill the surrounding park.

As Ms. Leidy notes in one of the show's succinct and informative wall texts, ancient Hindu epics tell of the city of Kiskinda, the great monkey capital reputed to be in South India and to have a glorious Shiva temple just like this one. Is it Kiskinda that's portrayed here? Impossible to say. But at least for the run of this show, the Asia Society is its sister city, where the monkeys' reign is benign, exuberant and, of course, absolute.

"Monkey" remains at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, through Sept. 10.
