IT’S common practice for companies to inject new products with a frisson of dare by naming them for gutsy pursuits or enticing destinations. But a Rolex Submariner may never plumb the ocean’s depths, and a Kia Sedona won’t always be traversing red-rock landscapes in Arizona.

The Honda Africa Twin comes by its name honestly, though. The motorcycle is a go-anywhere adventure bike that is the consumer-market descendant of a racing machine with a heroic résumé.

The original Africa Twin made its reputation by surviving, among other perils, thousands of miles of African desert and mountains to win the brutal Paris-Dakar Rally four times in the 1980s. (Because of terrorist attacks, the off-road race moved to South America in 2009 and is now called the Dakar.)

While a devoted following for the civilian version of the Africa Twin grew, the model never came to the United States, and the name fell into disuse more than a dozen years ago.
