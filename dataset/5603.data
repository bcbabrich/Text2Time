An interest in playwriting led Ms. Vance to acting lessons and a stint, eventually, at a ''boot camp for actors'' in London. ''I came back planning to play Lady Macbeth and Juliet but no one thought I looked like them, I guess,'' the black feminist comedian said. ''I did not become a household word in the weeks I've given myself to be one.'' She'd been a star of sorts acting comic monologues in high school in Chicago. Boarding in that city with her grandparents after her return to the States, she took to sneaking out late at night to perform in small comedy clubs.

''It is so difficult to get up and make people laugh,'' she said. ''I didn't use my real name. I called myself 'Some Little Colored Girl.' But people did laugh. I started making money. 'This is too good,' I thought. 'I'll go suffer in New York.' '' Invited to perform at a black feminists' conference, Ms. Vance arrived here in 1981. She soon found herself playing a leading role in a production of ''Native Son.'' Other acting jobs followed in small theaters around town, but she counts a highly popular and well-received season at La Mama last year as her breakthrough, after which she joined ''Saturday Night Live.''

Described as a cross between Little Richard and Laurie Anderson, Ms. Vance does monologues with songs performed with her back-up group, the Mell-o White Boys, which includes Steve Canale, Rob Yampolsky and Ron Stach. But it is her characters -zany and poignant walking satires on life today - who stand out unforgettably. Among those she may play on Sunday are Flotilda William, ghetto Shakespearean actress, in ''Romeo and Juliet''; Harriet Hetero, the Feminist Stripper; Tracy Dance Donaldson, the rhythm therapist who, to lines from Elizabeth Barrett Browning set to Motown music, teaches whites to get with it; Cabrini Green, a young but knowing unwed mother, and Robin the Reluctant Transsexual.

Where does the inspiration come from? ''Real life, my very rich fantasy life, and things I think people should be thinking about from a different point of view,'' Ms. Vance said. ''My fascist life - arbiter of culture.'' 'How Heat Drives People Crazy'

The Alien Comic works with ''topical humor,'' as he puts it. Mr. Murrin tackles any subject, telling stories and roaring with manic energy and innocence through a mess of trash props, some of which he wears. On Sunday he is likely to perform a new piece called ''Hot Enough for You?'' ''I might call it 'Hot and Humid Rules,' '' he said - a title inspired by graffiti he has observed. ''I try to do shows that kind of fit in someplace. This will be about how heat drives people crazy and humidity drives them over the edge. How to cope with it. A lot of my shows are false lectures.''

He got his current alias from a club manager on the West Coast. ''What's this guy?'' the man remarked as he listened to a description of Mr. Murrin's work. ''Sounds pretty alien to me.''

Mr. Murrin left Los Angeles, where he worked as a lawyer specializing in criminal law in the 1960's, to come to New York and be a writer. ''I wrote fiction,'' he recalled, ''but it wasn't very good.'' A play by Sam Shepard at La Mama turned him to playwriting. ''Oh boy, can they do this on stage?'' he remembered thinking at the time. He took his new work to Ellen Stewart, La Mama's venerable founder and director, who pronounced the first few plays ''not so good,'' Mr. Murrin recalled. She found the next ones ''O.K.'' and produced them, and he went on to work with such luminaries of the times as John Vaccaro.
