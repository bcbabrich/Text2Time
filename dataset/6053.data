TEL AVIV, May 31—Israel cautioned the United States today that President Carter's statements about a “homeland” and compensation for the Palestinians were raising Arab expectations unrealistically and might harden the Arabs' attitude in Middle East peace talks.

Foreign Minister Yigal Allon summoned the United States ambassador, Samuel Lewis, to Jerusalem today and asked him to convey the Government's concern to Washington.

The Israelis have maintained that a Palestinian homeland and compensation were not elements of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 of 1967 and 338 of 1973, which the United States has regarded as the framework for progress toward peace.

Resolution 242, which was reaffirmed by 338, spoke of “a just settlement of the refugee problem” but did not mention Palestinians by name. It also expressed the principle that every nation lit the Middle East had the “right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.”
