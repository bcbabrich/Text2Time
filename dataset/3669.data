Voicing concern about the face that Rockefeller Center will project to Fifth Avenue and the world, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission recommended yesterday that the center's owners scale back plans to turn some stone exteriors into virtual walls of glass.

The commission's 11 members took no formal action during a public meeting on the topic. But they did say, cordially but firmly, that the architects hired by Rockefeller Center's owner needed to produce ideas that were more in line with the landmark's architectural and historical traditions.

''It's par for the course to have revisions in large and important applications,'' said Jennifer J. Raab, the commission's chairwoman. ''But there was a level of concern over some of the elements that would be out of character of Rockefeller Center's architecture.''

In particular, the commission said that it was uncomfortable with a proposal by the architects, Beyer Blinder Belle, to replace the muted second-story office windows with retail display windows. It was also uncomfortable, though less adamantly, with a plan to expand one-story showcases along Fifth Avenue with much more glass and bigger signs.
