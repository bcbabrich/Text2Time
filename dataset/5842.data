Darryl F. Allen has been elected president and chief operating officer of the Libbey-Owens-Ford Company, a major glass maker for the auto industry.

The position of president had been held by Don T. McKone, who remains chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. McKone added the title after Frederick W. Schwier, the former president, left last year to become chairman and chief executive officer of the Aro Corporation.

Mr. Allen, who is 41 years old, is taking over at a time when the company's businesses are on the rebound.

In 1981, when auto sales were low, the company closed two of its older glass plants. That year it earned $11.8 million on sales of $1.23 billion. By 1983, as the auto industry began to recover, the profits of Libbey-Owens- Ford increased - to $40.4 million on sales of $1.17 billion.
