Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, the Commissioner of Correctional Services, issued a statement tonight apologizing for the way in which he presented remarks about crime and minorities in a recent newspaper interview.

The remarks, published Friday in The Albany Times-Union, had angered members of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, who urged Governor Cuomo to seek Mr. Coughlin's ouster.

In the interview, when asked why he thought a high percentage of crimes were committed by members of minority groups, he was quoted as saying: ''Oh, because they don't have jobs. They have no family structure. They don't have a place to live.''

In his two-page statement today, Mr. Coughlin said: ''I offer my apology that my comments, made before the Capital District Newspaper editorial board, were not more artfully presented.''
