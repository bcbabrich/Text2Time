You may never find a purple cow in real life, but Zynga’s fortunes are very real.

With its S-1 filing on Friday, the profitable online game company now has a date with the public markets. Its initial public offering, which is expected to value the company at $20 billion or more, should yield a huge windfall for Zynga’s owners, a small group of venture capital investors and senior executives.

Who stands to gain the most?

Mark Pincus, Zynga’s chief executive

By far, the founder of Zynga has the largest stake in the company. Mr. Pincus and his related entities own 91,385,846 class B shares, about 16 percent of the pool. He also owns all of the available Class C shares (20,517,472 shares). Mr. Pincus, who made $435,000 in salary and bonus last year, will not have to scrape by until the I.P.O. In March, he sold 7,840,836 class B shares, worth $109.5 million. The coming I.P.O. will not be the first for Mr. Pincus. The executive was the chairman of Support.com, which went public in 2000. At the time, he owned 17.1 percent of the company, according to a 2000 filing, and sold a portion of the stake in the I.P.O.

Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers

Kleiner Perkins, represented by Bing Gordon, a partner in the venture capital firm and a Zynga board member, led a $29 million funding round in the company back in June 2008. Through its investments, the firm owns 11 percent of class B shares, about 64.2 million shares.

Union Square Ventures

Back in January 2008, when Zynga was less than a year old, Union Square Ventures decided to throw its weight behind the company, leading a $10 million round (the first major funding round). “People already love to play casual games,” Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, told The New York Times then. “But when you take a casual game and stick it inside a social network, it becomes way more exciting. This is like pouring gasoline on fire.” His statement proved to be a sage bet. Union Square and its related entities own 5.5 percent of Zynga’s class B shares, or 30.7 million shares. The firm managed to sell about $25 million worth of shares in January.

Institutional Venture Partners

The venture capital firm, which has investments in Twitter and Netflix, owns 34.3 million class B shares, worth 6.1 percent of the pool.

Foundry Venture Capital

Foundry was one of Zynga’s earliest backers. It started investing in Zynga in November 2007 (when it was named Presidio Media) and it participated in Zynga’s first major financing round in January 2008. Its managing director, Brad Feld, who founded the firm in 2007, has served on Zynga’s board since November 2007. In a 2008 blog post, Mr. Feld said, “Over the past six months, I’ve become an incredible believer in the appeal of social gaming as a broad idea and see it as a disrupting force in the overall gaming industry.” The Foundry owns 34.6 million class B shares, about 6.1 percent of the pool.

Avalon Ventures

The venture capital firm owns 34.7 million class B shares, which represent about 6.1 percent of total class B shares.

D.S.T. Global

If it is a multibillion-dollar Web company on the verge of an I.P.O., the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner probably has a hand in it. His venture capital firm, DST Global, owns 32.8 million class B shares, worth 5.8 percent of the pool. Unlike the other venture capital firms in this group, DST was a bit late to the party. The firm made its first investment in late 2009. It led a group of investors in buying a $180 million stake.

Bear in mind, not all shares are created equal. Zynga’s I.P.O. features three classes of stock, class A, B and C. Class A shares will be issued to public shareholders, while class B and C shares will stay in the hands of its top executives and venture capital investors. Although it is not clear how much voting control Mr. Pincus owns through his class C shares, it is superior to class B, which trumps class A. Mr. Pincus, who owns all of class C, will have more voting power as class B shares convert to class A (shares convert in the event of a sale).

This may seem like a sour deal for Zynga’s public shareholders, but the filing does provide fair warning:
