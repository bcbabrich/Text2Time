Ilie Nastase won't have the United States Open to kick around anymore. The temperamental Rumanian, seeded No. 7 in singles, was ousted in the second round of the tennis championships yesterday by Corrado Barazzutti of Italy, 6‐4, 6‐4, and then dropped out of the doubles shortly afterward.

“Nastase phoned me from his hotel,” said Bob Howe, the assistant referee, “saying he was so tired and his leg hurt, so he was going home and rest.”

Nastase's defeat was a surprise—but not the only one—on a stiflingly humid day at Forest Hills, Queens. On an afternoon that saw four former champions make an early exit from the tournament, Stan Smith, seeded No. 16, bowed to Mike Fishbach and Fishbach's controversial “spaghetti” racquet, 6‐0, 6‐2. Fishbach, a 22‐year‐old qualifier from Great Neck, L.I., is playing in his first Open.

Stolle Also Loses

Smith, the winner of the 1971 Open, and Nastase, who won in ‘72, were part of the group of defeated champions that included Fred Stolle of Australia, the 1966 victor, and Maria Bueno of Brazil, who won the women's crown in 1966. Stolle lost to fifth‐seeded Manuel Orantes of Spain, 6‐2, 6‐2, while Miss Bueno dropped a 6‐2, 6‐3 verdict to Virginia Ruzici of Rumania.
