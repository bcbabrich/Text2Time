While there’s no recess in the Dining Table Wine School, we do pause now and then for a bit of additional refreshment, which is how I happen to be writing about martinis in my column for Wednesday’s paper. I’m annoyed at myself for even asking this question, but when’s the last time you had a real martini? Not a chocolate cocktail, or watermelon drink or any of the other spurious hangers-on that threaten the integrity of the word martini, but a real honest-to-goodness gin-and-vermouth martini?

What annoys me is that few people really know or care what a martini is anymore. They’ve just appropriated the appeal of the term to sell other cocktails, drinks that may be fine themselves but are decidedly not martinis. I’m far from the only one bothered by this (actually, more amused than bothered, to be honest). Check out this rant by Fredric Koeppel, a good friend of The Pour, in his blog Bigger Than Your Head.

In any case, the purpose of the column Wednesday is not so much to weigh in on authenticity in martinis. No, it was to see how different gins affect the quality of the martini. To that end, we tasted martinis made with 20 different gins. I hope you’ll find the results as interesting as we did, even without all those martinis.

Now, back to school. But first, I need to ask this question. Am I the only one who loves cold fried chicken? I mean, isn’t that one of the signature picnic dishes? It’s great! And yet recently when I’ve mentioned cold fried chicken to a few people they looked at me as if I was insane. I’d be the first to admit that I’ve dabbled with some crazy dishes. I did go to school in New England, where it was considered highly desirable to melt cheddar cheese on apple pie, and I did enjoy that preparation – until I came to my senses. Nowadays, the idea of it makes me somewhat ill. Perhaps an unconscious association with some college experience that I’ve otherwise buried deep in a place where I hope no psychotherapist can ever visit? Who knows? But cold fried chicken, I have no doubts about the pleasures of that dish.

Maybe it’s my association of this dish with picnics that led me to the two sauvignon blanc wines in my stash. Sauvignon blanc is likewise a great wine for outside dining, rivaled only by rosé. And so, with a plate of cold fried chicken and dreams of picnics to come I pulled out the 2006 “Private Bin’’ from Villa Maria in New Zealand, selected by Joy, and the 2005 Sancerre from Gérard Boulay, chosen by Lyle.

Sancerre has always been a popular wine, and even though it lost some of its sway over sauvignon blanc to New Zealand and other places, it’s still a well-known name. “Sancerre’s a brand, even if people don’t really know what it is,’’ Lyle told me. “If they’ve heard about one wine, it’s Sancerre, and you can introduce the name of the place, and if it’s from Sancerre it has to be sauvignon blanc – the whole French concept.’’

This Sancerre, from the Chavignol area, was a really good one. It was light-bodied, almost ethereal, with a flavor full of lemon and minerals. As the wine warmed up, the minerality really emerged, a reminder that we often drink white wines too cold to experience their full range of flavors. This was such a subtle wine that I was happy to have tasted it first, because I thought the bold and brassy Villa Maria might have blown it away. That wine, from the Marlborough region of New Zealand, has that classic, piercing grassy flavor interlaced with lemon and tropical melon flavors, too. Both are refreshingly dry, which you can’t always count on nowadays when supposedly dry wines spring booby traps of residual sugar on you.

As it turned out, both wines went great with the chicken, and the Sancerre more than held its own with the New Zealand wine – a welcome reminder never to confuse a light body or subtlety with wimpiness.

On another night, my wife, Deborah, made pizzas from scratch. They were so good, topped with tomato sauce and buffalo mozzarella, as well as sun-dried tomatoes, spicy Italian ham or pepperoni. I’m sure they would have been great with a barbera, dolcetto or Chianti, or the Allegrini Palazzo della Torre that I wrote about in my last post. But that wine was gone, so I chose two from my remaining supply: a 2004 Enrique Foster IQUE malbec from Mendoza, Argentina, which Joy had chosen, and a 2005 Sobon Estate zinfandel from Lubenko Vineyard in Fiddletown, in the Sierra Foothills, which Lyle had picked.

Now, I’m not usually a big malbec fan, but I was resolved to give it a shot. “Argentina seems very hot, and everyone is drinking malbec,’’ Joy had told me. “It resonates with people who aren’t used to drinking wine.’’

Surprising myself, I found this to be a really interesting wine, with aromas of fruit, flowers and licorice, and a really nice earthiness. I also found a little heat in the mouth – it was 14 percent alcohol – but I was willing to overlook that, especially since it was $8.95 a bottle. What a steal! I couldn’t help thinking that if it were a $20 wine, it would have been all mucked up with oaky vanilla flavors, in which case it would have been a bore like, well, like the zinfandel.

“It’s classic: jammy, rich, ripe but with acidity,’’ Lyle had told me. “It kind of represents what’s going on in American viticulture.’’

I liked the idea that it came from an organic vineyard, and that it had a screwcap. But really, it had so much vanilla flavor it tasted like cherry cheesecake. And, at 15.1 percent alcohol, it also tasted hot.

I do want to try more zinfandels this summer, although it’s hard to find bottles that are not super-high in alcohol. I will seek them out, though, unless I get distracted by malbecs.
