After the Federal agents finished their intensive search, after the Ted Koppel town meeting, after the small army of reporters had gone and without a single television camera left to record the event, the women here did what they always do when someone is in trouble: they put on a fund-raising supper.

It was held tonight at the Lamotte Township Fire Hall, as such suppers usually are, but this time it was not for anyone they knew. It was for the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing.

In the past week, similar fund-raisers have undoubtedly been organized in thousands of small towns across America. But Decker, a conservative Republican area about 100 miles north of Detroit, in Michigan's rural "thumb" region and has one post office, one bar and 90 people, is not just another sleepy small community anymore. It is the place where James and Terry Nichols, who are being held as material witnesses in the Oklahoma City bombing, are accused of conspiring to make explosives with Timothy McVeigh, the primary suspect in the blast in Oklahoma City.

In its own way, the fund-raising supper tells more about places like Decker than all the television specials, and the camera crews that have flooded the area since Federal agents blocked off the Nichols farm and began searching for explosives. If there were members of paramilitary groups present they didn't call attention to themselves. There were quite a few farmers dressed in work clothes, who had driven through high winds and a cold rain.
