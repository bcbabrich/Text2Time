This is Alice Mathias somehow magically reporting for a not-student-run news organization from the trenches of my senior spring at Dartmouth College. For the past four years, I have been studying in a safe, town-sized bubble in the New Hampshire wilderness, and on June 10th this bubble is scheduled to burst, at which point, along with (most of) the class of 2007, I will be catapulted into adulthood.

When we were kids, my friends and I played a game called MASH. This game forecast whether we would grow up to live in Mansions, Apartments, Shacks, or Houses, what our jobs would be, where in the world we would live, which of our celebrity crushes we would marry, and most importantly, what kind of pet we would have. All we had to do was pick a number 1 through 10 and our destinies would unfold before our eyes. If we didn’t like these destinies, we could just play the game again.

Back in our MASH days, our dream jobs were firefighting, I-banking, sales and trading, consulting, wealth management, mergers and acquisitions, and real estate finance. We wanted to live in the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side, Greenwich or Great Neck. We understood that if we failed to find true love after the first shot, we could marry/divorce every crush on our lists. The pet issue was the only one that was really up for grabs. (I’m still crossing my fingers for that designer Labradoodle.)

O.K., fine –– no one actually knew what “I-banking” meant when we were kids. We still don’t understand the specifics, but roughly translated it means: “getting rich.” Whatever it is, a stunning percentage of my generation’s most promising brainiacs are doing it. They could be curing diseases or discovering alternative energy sources or living at their parents’ houses, but instead, they are making millions for the Man over at the bank-tank.

The banker plague is spread by a phenomenon known as corporate recruiting. Every year, serious New York guys in coats and ties descend on college campuses and convince the smartest kids that the surefire way to afford a castle on the moon is by crunching numbers at places like J.P. Bored-Again, Bored-Again Stanley, Merrill Lynching, Deutsche Bag, or Lame-Man Brothers. The other option is to do consulting at Bane. (Note: these are fake names. Real names have been withheld to ward off any more competition for my well-paying job.)



I-Banking would seem to be a suitable ambition for I-vy League members of what has been coined the “I-Generation” for more reasons than are initially apparent. (The I-thing!) Sure, we all want to be able to buy iPods for our kids or celebrity spouses or designer pets. Yes, the Internet has made us realize that there is a lot of competition out there for hip apartments and e-Bay’s limited edition “Virgin Mary’s Face in a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.” All that said, I don’t think that the class of 2007’s huge population of econ majors is a direct symptom of our insatiable appetite for “stuff” (that edible relic would surely be filling enough).

I respect my many bank-bent peers who feel the need to make a lot of money for one glaringly freaky reason. In a speech to first-year Dartmouth students, an engineering professor who was lecturing about genetics said (with a completely straight face): “it is completely conceivable that [his generation] is among the last of generations to ever experience natural biological aging and death.” Basically this not-joking genius told everyone that, thanks (or no thanks) to science, the class of 2007 might be (drum roll please) I-mmortal! (No, not the baddum-ching kind of drum roll. This is not a joke: we might get really, freakishly old.)

All we’ll have to do is pop a few fountain-of-youth geltabs at night before brushing our teeth, and eternity will be ours. The only catch is that we will still have to outrun those “unnatural” causes of aging and death.

My class is graduating into a world that is changing faster than ever before. We’re living in a weird society today that will most assuredly be weirder tomorrow. By the time my generation takes over the reins, we’ll be steering an entirely different pony. Probably a robotic pony. (Oops! That Labradoodle just got bucked off my wish list.)

Being a citizen led by a contentious bipartisan government is like being the child of divorced parents (something that my generation knows a lot about.) As ordinary civilians, we are the nearly powerless witnesses to a lot of problem-pushing and finger-pointing. There is a big split, but no matter what, we are somehow still a family.

The class of 2007 has grown up trying to reconcile Papa Bush’s crusade against terrorism with Mama Gore’s videotaped PowerPoints insisting that global warming is a bigger threat to our well-being. The “adults” have instructed us to prepare for attacks and floods and polar bear holocausts. These competitors for our affection all trumpet different versions of Armageddon and seem to agree on just one thing: that the kids aren’t going to be safe.

Hurricane Katrina and the war in Iraq have underscored the notion that money is the common citizen’s only viable safety net. It doesn’t take an econ major to recognize basic applications of supply and demand. When helicopter rides out of danger zones become limited, they go to the rich. When the American Army finds itself with limited resources, it goes to the poor. If my classmates and I are going to live forever, we can expect to face many natural and man-made disasters. If these problems are not somehow avoided, it seems they will be escaped only by those who can afford a one-way ticket to that castle on the moon.

We won’t need to worry about not being immortal if we can elect the right leadership. For as long as I can remember, I have been moving back and forth between the Bush and Clinton White Houses. My peers and I know no other presidents. The family ideals of America’s Montagues and Capulets have trickled down and shaped the graduating class that we are today –– that is, they have shaped us into a class that is, by and large, turned off by the idea of growing up to be politicians. All the smartest kids in the room have instead elected to go Mr. Moneybags à la Monopoly.

I don’t mean to make an all-encompassing declaration of doom. The truth is that many of my clever peers have snuck through the corporate cracks and will ideally make a big difference in other arenas of society, maybe even in politics. Things are already looking up. Somehow the Democrats have recently found a smart guy who is miraculously dumb enough to want to be president. He’s hip, too. Maybe he’ll start a smart-politician trend. If he doesn’t manage to sway intelligent young people into pursuing politics, at least we can count on him to inspire political engagement in the crush category of MASH games across America.
