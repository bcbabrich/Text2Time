GARY MOELLER, former Michigan football coach, was ordered by a judge in Southfield, Mich., yesterday to pay $409 in fines and fees on charges stemming from a drunken scene earlier this month in a restaurant. District Judge BRYAN LEVY ordered no probation or other punishment for Moeller, saying that what Moeller, 54, went through after his arrest has exceeded the offense. He lost his job as Michigan football coach. (AP)
