In the first quarter, Joe Dawkins's 32‐yard kick off return gave the Giants the ball at their 44‐yard line. All they got out of that possession was George Hunt's 35‐yard field goal.

In the second quarter, a decent drive took them to the Dallas 36, but Harvey Martin sacked Morton on third down and Hunt had to,punt. Later in the quarter, Jim Stienke, playing free safety in place of the injured Spider Lockhart, intercepted two Staubach passes. The Giants couldn't get a first down either time.

The third quarter provided even better opportunities. A running‐into‐the‐punter penalty kept a Giant drive alive and its was further enhanced when the officials placed the ball at the Dallas 9 for a first down after it appeared that Morton had failed to make the necessary one foot.

However, on third down from the 7, Morton threw a pass in Walker Gillette's direction only to have it snared out of its route by Ed (Too Tall) Jones, the 6foot‐9‐inch left end.

“We had a safety blitz and I had to cover the backs man‐to‐man,” Jones said after his first N.F.L. interception. “We drifted back and Craig threw it and it just happened to be in my reach and I caught it. It scared the daylights out of me.”

“I tried to get away from the safety blitz to get the ball off,” the quarterback added, “and the only receiver open was Gillette. Everybody else was blocking. He [Jones] just fell off and he was there.”

Later in the quarter, a pass interference call against Leroy Jordan, the outstanding linebacker, gave the Giants the ball at the 50, but on the next play a clipping penalty against Gillette sent the ball back to the 35 and moments later Morton was dumped by Jethro Pugh on third down.
