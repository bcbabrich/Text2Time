ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Looking more like Fat Elvis than the Big Puma, Lance Berkman had a rocky first two games with the Yankees, which he readily acknowledged. He went 1 for 8 over the weekend with a few shaky plays at first base Sunday that helped the Rays score all of their runs in a 3-0 victory.

“I told Andy that several times over the last day and a half I’ve been about to burst into tears,” said Berkman, referring to Andy Pettitte. “Literally, the emotion is incredible. I haven’t experienced anything like that. There’s a sadness there. It’s just weird. I’m thrilled to be here, this is a great opportunity, it’s not that.

“When you spend that much of your career with one organization and you think about all the people that you meet over there — little things, when we go on the road, I know what’s expected as far as getting your bag out, your bus times. Here, I’m like, ‘What do I do?’ It can fluster you.”

Berkman and his wife have four daughters, whose school is around the corner from their home in Houston. Leaving them on road trips did not seem as bad because he knew he would always come back and sleep in his own bed. For support, he has leaned on Pettitte, one of his best friends.

As the Yankees were pondering trading for Berkman, Pettitte said General Manager Brian Cashman did not ask for his opinion because “I knew you wouldn’t have anything bad to say about him, so it really wasn’t fair.”

In his debut Saturday, Berkman went 0 for 4. He said he was tired and excited and “overamped.” He was able to relax a little more on Sunday, and he said he was looking forward to playing his first game at home on Monday night against Toronto.

“I had a guy wearing me out at first base all day today,“ Berkman said. “I know that can happen there, too, maybe.”

Asked which team his heckler supported, Berkman laughed.

“I think it was a Rays fan,” Berkman said. “I’m hoping.”
