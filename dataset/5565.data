A Federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction today halting the program that pays dairy operators to slaughter their cattle. It also orders the Department of Agriculture to limit the number of animals sent to market.

The action grew out of a lawsuit filed in April by beef cattle producers' associations and individual producers from Texas and Montana.

The suit said the program, designed to reduce dairy herds and cut surplus milk production, had cost the cattle industry $25 million in lost revenue in the first week of April and cut the value of cattle on inventory by $2 billion.

In addition to issuing the preliminary injunction, the judge, Halbert O. Woodward, ordered that the Department of Agriculture immediately prepare regulations to specify marketing procedures to limit the total dairy cattle marked for slaughter to no more than 7 percent of the national dairy herd each year.
