After 23 years on the Supreme Court bench, Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun stepped down today in a simple court ceremony.

Moments after the Justices issued the term's final six decisions, two of which were written by Justice Blackmun, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist read a brief letter from all the Court members paying tribute to their retiring colleague.

But the letter included a remark that some in the courtroom saw as double edged. The Chief Justice referred to a Blackmun opinion he has criticized, the one establishing the constitutional right to an abortion, saying: "Your opinions have covered a wide range of the issues that come before the Court. You are undoubtedly best known for having authored the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade in 1973, but that distinction should not obscure the many other important issues on which you have spoken for the Court."

Justice Blackmun, who is planning to move to Jacksonville, Fla., although he will maintain an office here, responded by quoting the retirement letter of Justice William O. Douglas, who compared serving with his colleagues to being an outdoorsman with its "occasional long and strenuous portages, and the last night's and the last morning's campfires."
