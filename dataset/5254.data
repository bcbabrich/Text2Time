We're lucky. We have a house in the country. The house is in Massachusetts, 137.6 miles from our apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan - if we take the Taconic State Parkway north and then Route 23 east. If we take the Saw Mill River Parkway and Interstate 684 and Route 22, turning off at Wassaic and proceeding through Sharon, Conn., and Mill River, Mass., then the whole trip is 114.7 miles. Sometimes we take the Taconic Parkway only as far north as Route 44, and travel east from there through Millbrook and then Sharon, etc. 121.6 miles. There are other routes that we sometimes take, and I know the mileage for all of them as well as I know the first symptoms of car-seat fatigue from my 1-year-old daughter and, from my son, the question ''Are we almost there?'' which he begins to ask 8.4 miles into the northbound journey (in Yonkers, that is) and 6.3 into the southbound leg.

For, you see, I have made this same trip thousands of times. I have been making it for more than 40 years. (I remember the Hawthorne Circle. I remember when you could buy fireworks in Connecticut; I remember when big, long cars squeezed past each other on the Taconic. I remember when you could take the train!) Getting there has become - for me - so much less than half the fun that I would need to resort to a negative fraction to express it mathematically. The tedium, which grew exquisite, almost ecstatic, more than a decade ago, has now been whatever the opposite of ''leavened'' is by the otherwise joyful addition of our two young children, who, naturally, lack the repressive power that adults have and consequently do what I would in my heart of hearts like to do for a large part of the trip - whine, cry, eat and (if we're in luck) fall asleep.

When and if the kids do take naps simultaneously, my wife and I try to have some adult conversation. ''After all, it's really one of the few chances we get,'' we say to each other. Here's how it goes:

ME: So what's on your mind?

WIFE: I've been trying to figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life.

ME: And what have you come up with?

WIFE: I've been thinking of taking up a new line of work. The trouble is, nothing else really appeals to me. Silence for .4 miles. ME: You know, I've been sort of wondering what I'm going to do with myself, too. WIFE: And? ME: Well, maybe I could go into a different profession. But then I have to remember that I like my job pretty well. WIFE: I know what you mean. Silence for 1.6 miles. ME: We could sell the house and buy another one that's a little more, um, convenient. WIFE: That's an idea. ME: But we won't. WIFE: No, we won't. ME: We couldn't sell it. WIFE: No, we couldn't. Silence for 2.8 miles.
