Season 2, Episode 5

O.K., it’s obvious that writing snippets of a fictional novel so that they can be read aloud on television — a novel whose author, we’ve been told, is “an incredibly strong writer” — is a losing proposition. They’re never going to be good enough. But when we finally heard bits and pieces of Noah Solloway’s “Descent” on “The Affair” on Sunday night, it was hard to have much sympathy for the screenwriter (in this case the playwright Sharr White).

“Would she remember him? His voice felt lost in his throat.” “He lifted her skirt, just an inch. He paused. They listened together to the sound of the marina, hearts shaking in their skin.” “She was sex, the very definition of it. She was the reason the word was invented.” From there it just turned pornographic, 50 shades of sea foam. The expression on the face of Ruth Wilson, as Alison, grew progressively darker as she read the manuscript, which was supposed to be her response to its growing explicitness but which you’d like to think means that she has more taste than people give her credit for.

Alison’s perusal of “Descent” — left out on Yvonne’s work desk — was the dramatic high point of the episode’s first chapter, which was devoted to her point of view. Reading the book enraged her, because it brought home to her how powerless she was. She’d just been fired as Yvonne’s assistant, with a strong hint that it was because of Yvonne’s jealousy, fed both by Noah’s book and by how close Yvonne’s husband, Robert, was getting to Alison. Now she saw herself exploited by Noah, depicted as an East End siren with an insatiable sex drive. As she told her ex after she fled back to Montauk, “People don’t see me, Cole.”

The real problem is that “The Affair” itself has never exactly seen her as more than a victim and a bundle of guilt, neurosis and small-town, working-class awkwardness. (As if you don’t learn a little sophistication growing up in Montauk.) It’s not that her timorousness doesn’t make sense, given events, but she’s so relentlessly belittled, in both the writing and direction, that it’s hard to have any real sympathy for her. If she gets out of the subway in Brooklyn, she has to be overwhelmed by the city crowd. If she goes into town to run errands for Yvonne, she isn’t given the car — she has to be on her rickety bicycle with Yvonne’s packages in a little-girl handlebar basket. When she gets angry, she expresses it petulantly and destructively, sweeping Yvonne’s books off a shelf. When she helps Robert with his physical therapy, the erection he develops is shot in a giggly close-up out of an “American Pie” movie. When she tells Robert the truth about her affair with Noah — already a questionable decision — she uses language like “I felt this bolt of electricity course through me.” Wait, maybe that was why she was so upset when she read the manuscript — she actually wrote it!
