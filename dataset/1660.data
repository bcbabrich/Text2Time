Way, way too early to tell anything. But I have felt winter testing has been even more difficult to decipher than in years past. This could mean a very interesting season, or it could mean nothing.

But todayâ€™s testing times are just as bizarre, if not more so, than many of those so far (rejoice!):

1 Sebastian Vettel Red Bull Racing 1m19.055 87

2 Felipe Massa Ferrari 1m20.330 63

3 Kamui Kobayashi Toyota 1m20.699 80

4 Nico Rosberg Williams 1m21.171 71

5 Robert Kubica BMW Sauber 1m21.292 47

6 Giancarlo Fisichella Force India F1 1m21.584 31

7 Pedro de la Rosa Vodafone McLaren Mercedes 1m21.831 94

8 Nelson Piquet Renault 1m22.011 54
