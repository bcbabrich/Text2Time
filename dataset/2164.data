"I think eating anything that will absorb the alcohol is a good choice," she explained. "But I just can't seem to get my friends to eat some healthy whole wheat toast when we're all really drunk."

Frank Kelly Rich, the editor of Modern Drunkard, a monthly humor magazine in Denver, said that during his years as an Army Ranger in the early 1980's he used to hit up the medics for intravenous saline drips, which, he maintains, brought an instant revival of energy. Since then, he said, he has turned to Propel Fitness Water, explaining, "It has lots of B vitamins and goes down easier than water."

Some hangover remedies involve multiple and specific steps. Casey Cunniffe, 35, a production manager at Time Warner Inc., who lives in Norwalk, Conn., usually ends a night of indulgence with a fried egg sandwich, then wakes up to a vanilla milkshake -- and a glass of beer mixed with 7-Up for acute cases, he said.

"The hair of the dog thing works, as long as you're not going anywhere," Mr. Cunniffe said. "The milkshake helps cool you down."

Quaint tales about miracle cures available in the refrigerator have survived into the age of nanotechnology in part because even physicians cannot agree on what precisely causes a hangover, said Dr. Jason D. Rosenberg, the director of the headache clinic at Johns Hopkins University.

The symptoms are familiar enough: headache, nausea and grogginess. Most authorities, he said, agree that they seem to be caused by a combination of factors resulting from intoxication by alcohol, including dehydration, dilation of blood vessels around the brain, changes in certain chemical levels in the body and alteration of the sleep cycle.

But no one knows exactly how large a role each of those causes plays, which means that no one knows exactly how to treat them, Dr. Rosenberg said. Besides, he added, certain aspects of the art of hangover management actually do have some basis in science. Salty food, for instance, is not a bad idea, nor are sugary drinks. "You need water and salt to stay hydrated," he said. "But I wouldn't go drinking seawater." The electrolytes -- salts -- in sports drinks like Gatorade can be helpful, he said.

Other favored hangover balms, however, would seem worthless, he said. Eggs, which many sufferers swear by, are high in protein and cholesterol, but neither of those seems to have anything to do with hangovers. Spicy food will do nothing more "than make your breath smell really interesting," Dr. Rosenberg added. As for the raw fish Mr. Anante relies on, it is of no apparent value, "unless you're a really drunk polar bear."

Hair of the dog, meanwhile, only prolongs dehydration and replenishes the body with toxins. As for fatty foods, they're "a mistake, because the liver can't process all of these things at once," said Dr. Marc K. Siegel, an internist at New York University Medical School. "You're bombarding your liver with a toxin, then bombarding it with fat."

To him the best bet is a cup of coffee, a dash of Mylanta and a lot of water. "It's not sexy," Dr. Siegel said. "But those things work."

As for the number of new hangover products on the market, many are made by small companies and marketed primarily through the Internet, said Mark Blumenthal, the executive director of the American Botanical Council, a nonprofit organization in Austin, Tex., devoted to education on herbal medicines. According to the British study, many of those herbal remedies have not undergone rigorous medical testing.

Mike Pearson, a programmer for an aerospace firm in Los Angeles, took matters into his own hands in 2003 with a Web site called www.hangoverreview.com. On the site he and his friends started trying out the handful of commercial remedies then available. Since then, Mr. Pearson said, so many new hangover remedies have entered the market that he has a hard time keeping up.

"Since the hangover cure market popped," he wrote in an e-mail message, "almost all vitamin manufacturers have added some kind of hangover cure to their list."He said many cures could have some value simply because "the basic principle of providing more of the vitamins your body needs to process alcohol is probably going to help to some degree."

While doctors uniformly agree that the only real cure for a hangover is abstaining from alcohol altogether, some concede that the best folk remedies for those who succumb to temptation may be any of them, that is, whatever the individual thinks will work.

Edward L. Burlingame, a retired publishing executive who lives in Westchester County, said he has relied on the same morning-after remedy -- a dire brew of beef consomm√©, Worcestershire sauce and vodka known as a bull shot -- for years but allows that faith might be its most potent ingredient.

"There's the truth, and there's the larger truth," he said. "The truth is it probably doesn't work. The larger truth is that if you think it does, it makes all the difference."

Or, in Dr. Rosenberg's words, "If someone thinks something is going to work, they're usually going to get better."

There is another school of thought, however. As Christopher Israel, the general manager of the Ginger Man, a bar on East 36th Street, said, perhaps the best way to deal with a hangover is the most time-honored way, prolonged suffering.

"I wallow in my hangovers," Mr. Israel explained. "If you don't hangover, you didn't have a good time."
