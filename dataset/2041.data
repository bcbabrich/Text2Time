California and New York and other big boys can move up their 2008 presidential primaries to influence the nominating contest all they want, but tiny New Hampshire still has political muscle to spare.

This afternoon Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama fell in line with several rivals for the Democratic nomination and agreed to participate in New Hampshire’s first Democratic presidential debate, on June 3, sponsored by WMUR-TV, the Union Leader, and CNN.

The Clinton and Obama campaigns had been ambivalent about participating in the New Hampshire debate: Inundated with dozens of requests for debates around the country, the two camps had each preferred to stick to just six debates that are being sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee.

Both campaigns indicated today that they still plan to participate in those six D.N.C. debates, and are simply adding the New Hampshire forum to the list because, well, it’s New Hampshire, long home to the first-in-the-nation primary that has proved a springboard for candidate after candidate (including Bill “Comeback Kid” Clinton).

“The WMUR/Union Leader debate is an important part of the New Hampshire Primary tradition, and Senator Clinton is excited to participate,” said Clinton spokesperson Mo Elleithee in a statement. “She looks forward to this opportunity to continue her conversation with Granite Staters and demonstrate why she is the candidate most ready to lead and deliver the change we need.

“We look forward to participating in the DNC’s schedule of six sanctioned debates that begins in July,” Mr. Elleithee added.

The Clinton campaign emailed its statement to reporters around 1:30 p.m., and Mr. Obama’s statement went out about 30 minutes later.

“We had hoped that the DNC and the debate’s sponsors would agree to make this debate one of the DNC’s six sanctioned debates,” said Obama state director Matt Rodriguez. “However, Senator Obama believes talking about how we can change our politics with the other candidates in the home of the nation’s first primary is an opportunity too important to miss.”
