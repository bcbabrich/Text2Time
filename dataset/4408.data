"The Distinguished Gentleman" has a lot more credibility than most fish-out-of-water comedies, since it actually bothers to explain how a con man could find his way to Congress. The facts add up, and they're funny, too. Brisk direction by Jonathan Lynn and a savvy screenplay by Marty Kaplan give this a lot more snap than the average cookie-cutter comedy. What's more, Eddie Murphy is back at the top of his form, and he's not being raw, either. This film has some mildly raunchy moments, but by and large it's a holiday comedy that works for both adults and children.

"Leap of Faith" is worth recommending for a fine, intricate performance by Steve Martin in a non-comic role, and for other equally chancy touches, like a plot hinging on the question of religious faith. As a fraudulent faith healer, Mr. Martin holds this interestingly offbeat drama together until it quite literally reaches the point of no return. Two bonuses: a jaunty performance by Debra Winger as the faith healer's jaded manager, and a glorious gospel score.

"Aladdin" remains a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. For handkerchief appeal, there's "Lorenzo's Oil," a medical detective story that avoids inspirational corn. For sheer outrageousness, there's "Bad Lieutenant." And "The Crying Game" is still the cleverest film of the season.
