A small group of businessmen and bankers were discussing economic development in New York City over lunch recently, arguing about whether they would put any more productive facilities into the decaying city. The talk turned quickly toward crime, and to the problem of stealing in plants.

“You'd have to make something they couldn't carry out,” one man joked. Another, the head of a division of a major New York‐based corporation, said he certainly would not expand his plant in Brooklyn after he had seen the ease of doing business in Mississippi.

The conversation illustrates a severe problem facing the nation's central cities ‐ the loss of confidence in the urban environment by business. And in large part the Carter Administration urban policy announced last week is designed to change that deep‐seated attitude ‐ to persuade private enterprise to stay in the cities and to provide more jobs there.

“The principal thrust of this program is a reliance on the private sector,” says Roger Altman, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, a former New York investment banker and one of the architects of the urban program. After sweeping Federal programs in the 1960's and neglect of the cities in the 1970's, the Administration “feels strongly,” he said, “that the key to long‐term economic growth and employment in the cities is the private sector.”
