When Spinning first reached health clubs a few years ago, it was an instant hit with gym-goers. The International Health Racquet and Sportsclub Association estimates that nearly 46 percent of gyms now offer group cycling classes.

The success of Spinning has spawned a new concept in exercise: Group classes are moving out of the aerobics studio and onto the cardiovascular machines found on the gym floor. Treadmill classes in particular are beginning to appear on aerobics schedules all across the country.

Ellen Abbott, director of walking and running programs at the Boston Athletic Club, started ''Treading'' classes three years ago in response to members' comments about the tedium of working out alone on the treadmill. (She has since trademarked the concept.) In these classes, 25 or more people gather for guided jaunts in one area of the gym floor. Workouts involve climbing up inclines and sprinting toward imaginary finish lines while Ms. Abbott barks out instructions and encouragement.

Nancy Marchal, a private investor who is one of Ms. Abbott's students, sees Treading as a great equalizer. ''A world class runner can be beside a beginning walker following the same basic program but working at different speeds '' she said, noting that this inspires students to push each other -- and themselves -- harder.
