From a speech delivered by Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, before the Senate on April 28:

My Myth of the Day is that the vast majority of our nation's nearly eight and one-half million unemployed workers are receiving unemployment compensation benefits.

Losing a job is a terrible blow to an individual and his or her family. Even under the most generous unemployment compensation programs, only a portion of a worker's salary is replaced by unemployment benefits.

Even with these benefits, the families of unemployed workers are often forced to postpone all but absolutely necessary spending and may have to go into debt. How much tougher the situation becomes if no unemployment compensation benefits are available while a worker seeks a new job.

This is why we should concern ourselves with the fact that there has been an astonishing decline in the percentage of those unemployed individuals who are collecting unemployment insurance benefits.
