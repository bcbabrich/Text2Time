The Australian gold miner AurionGold advised shareholders to reject an improved takeover bid from Placer Dome of Canada. Aurion said Placer's offer, which values the Australian company at 1.37 billion Australian dollars ($745.1 million), was 10 percent below Aurion's stock price before Placer's hostile bid.
