''We'd like to insure that if and when inspections come about, we will not have clashes inside'' Iraq, said Hans Blix, the executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, which focuses on chemical and biological weapons.

Mr. Blix, who has long experience with Iraq as a former head of the energy agency here, declined to comment on the talks until after they end Tuesday. The Iraqi delegation, led by Amir al-Sadi, a special adviser to Mr. Hussein, left the building by a side entrance to avoid reporters.

In 1998, Iraq and the United Nations agreed to restrict access to eight palaces belonging to Mr. Hussein. Amid widespread suspicion that Iraq uses these complexes to hide plans for its nuclear, chemical and biological arms programs, the United States has demanded that they be opened.

A senior diplomat who attended today's meeting noted that the palaces were protected in an agreement between Iraq and the United Nations. ''We both recognized that this wasn't the place to discuss them,'' he said.

Also unresolved is whether the inspectors will be able to operate in the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq. Because Iraq does not control this airspace, it says it cannot provide adequate security.

Experts on the inspection process said Iraq had in the past forced inspectors to fly to distant, inconvenient airports. Their hotel rooms were broken into, sometimes while they were sleeping in them. They were transported in dilapidated buses. On a few occasions, the experts said, people even dumped plates of food into the visitors' laps at dinner.

''Even if you're only talking about logistics, the Iraqis can put up hurdles that make the inspectors' lives very difficult,'' said Gary Milholland, the director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington-based research and advocacy organization.
