But judging by the tempered reaction today, it seemed that even they would be reluctant to harshly repudiate a President who is 20 points ahead in the polls. Even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, an authority on welfare, refrained from criticizing his party's standard bearer.

''The President will take some heat on this,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''But the fact is, half the Democrats voted for the bill when it left the Senate. Clinton's not isolated in the Democratic Party on this position.'' If that argument fails, Mr. Garin said the President can always contend that his vetoes saved the country from a more extreme bill. ''Clinton can argue he made a bad situation much better,'' he said.

Or, as Fred Greenstein, a professor of politics at Princeton University, said, ''Clinton can say, 'I held out until I got something which wouldn't be unkind to children.' He can use it to claim credit to being true to his centrist principles.''

It is possible, though not likely, that many Democrats, lamenting the turning back of the Great Society, will be so disappointed in Mr. Clinton's stand on welfare that they will sit out the election.

Still, the bottom line is that liberals have no place to go. ''It's not ingenuous or a new strategy,'' said Robert M. Teeter, a pollster who headed Mr. Bush's campaign in 1992. ''The liberal base is not going to vote for Perot or Dole.''

Mr. Clinton's move not only takes a traditional Republican issue from Mr. Dole, but could help incumbents in Congress who have been hungry to pass some substantive measure that they can trumpet to voters who are sick of gridlock.

The action is probably less a political plus to Mr. Clinton than a detriment to Mr. Dole. Campaigning in Nashville this afternoon, there was frustration in Mr. Dole's voice as he told a business audience: ''There's not a dime's worth of difference between the bill he talked about today and the one he vetoed a few months back. The only difference is that it's 97 days before the election.''
