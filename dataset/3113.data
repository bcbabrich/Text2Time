The op-ed results suggest that an argument is raging in the country. But the journalistic sorting out of the facts that should inform that argument has diminished.

The deeper connections between Mr. Bush's political vision and the country that are most intriguing and significant are largely absent in the press treatment. Despite so tenuous a mandate for his bold conservative agenda, the press has largely ignored the subject of his relationship to the American public. Indeed, in Mr. Bush's first two months in office, the news outlets we surveyed featured only half as many stories on how presidential policies relate to the American people as they did in Mr. Clinton's early days.

The coverage, already shrunken, has focused on the most obvious and routine elements of Mr. Bush's new tenure.

In his first month the coverage was positive. It focused on quick judgments about whether Mr. Bush was up to the job -- and declared that the answer, after low expectations, was yes.

In the second month the coverage turned more critical as Mr. Bush's budget plan began to move through Congress. The coverage turned more negative, however, not because it keenly considered where the president wanted to take the country and how this would affect people, but because the budget plan seemed entangled in Congress. Mr. Bush's ideas, in other words, are being dealt with on the level probably least interesting to citizens -- the level of political jockeying.

What is missing in the picture are answers to the deeper questions most citizens -- except perhaps news junkies -- are concerned with: What change will the election and the crisis over voting bring? What are the implications of a president who lost the popular vote attempting to govern as if he had won it by a wide margin? How is it that Mr. Bush, a man depicted during the campaign as an affable deal maker not too concerned with policy, has emerged in the coverage as a sincere conservative willing to stake out a controversial agenda because he is so committed ideologically?

The consequences of the press further pulling back its coverage of the public debate -- now even of the White House -- are not trivial. Shrunken coverage leads to a shallower public understanding, more chance of abuse by special interests and less chance for the country to resolve its most difficult problems.

Not long ago, David Shribman, a journalist with The Boston Globe, reminded a group of journalism executives of how parents often define character for their children: it's how you act when no one is looking. The definition of character in journalism, Mr. Shribman said, was whether we cover stories we think people aren't paying attention to, but should be.
