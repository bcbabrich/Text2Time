Fred Wilpon is trying to buy Nelson Doubleday's 50 percent share of the Mets, and the owners have spent months squabbling over the deal. But Wilpon insisted yesterday that the negotiations would have no impact on the way General Manager Steve Phillips constructs the team for next season, and he hinted that he might authorize Phillips to exceed the budget to sign a top player.

''We have a 100 percent track record there,'' Wilpon said, referring to the times Phillips has asked for special permission to make a move. ''We've said yes every time. Over four or five years, there have been several times; more than two.''

The Mets would prefer to keep their payroll around $95 million for next season, but with trades for elite hitters failing to materialize, Phillips may turn to Wilpon for authorization to pursue a top free agent.

''Someone said to me, 'You're not going to get any free agents,' '' Wilpon said. ''I said, 'That's not entirely what Steve said.' Steve said we will more likely be getting our significant changes through the trade route because of the nature of our team. But he didn't preclude us from the free-agent market.''
