Stanford played Georgia Tech in the Seattle Bowl last Thursday, losing by 24-14, to the Yellow Jackets, who were led by the interim coach Mac McWhorter. The Cardinal finished 9-3 this season. Although Stanford has had three losing seasons since 1997, it was 44-36-1 and played in four bowl games during Willingham's seven seasons, the most prominent being the Rose Bowl after the 1999 season. Stanford won the Pac-10 title and he was named the conference's coach of the year that season.

Willingham took over as head coach when Bill Walsh left after the 1994 season. Before that, he was an assistant to Dennis Green with the Minnesota Vikings and at Stanford, where he was the running backs coach from 1989 to 1991.

Willingham has shown that a black coach can succeed at a major college. But blacks make up less than 5 percent of the head coaches among Division I-A programs, according to a study released last summer.

''Having Notre Dame make this decision might be the first time that we open the doors to the possibility of a much broader opportunity for people of color to be hired in positions of responsibility,'' said Richard E. Lapchick, the author of the study and the director of the sports business management program at Central Florida.

Willingham was first contacted by White after Davie was fired, said Gary Migdol, an assistant athletic director at Stanford. Then came Notre Dame's fiasco with O'Leary. But Willingham could not negotiate seriously with White until Stanford played its bowl game, said Migdol, who described the talks as a ''start-and-stop situation.''

The O'Leary incident turned out to be the latest in a string of public embarrassments for Notre Dame. The most prominent involved a former booster who gave gifts and money to players after embezzling $1.2 million from her employer. She was sentenced to jail in 1998, and the football program was placed on probation for the first time in December 1999.

It was one of several aspects of Davie's five-year tenure that Notre Dame would rather forget. He finished with a 35-25 record, the third-worst winning percentage for a Notre Dame coach. But Davie, who was promoted from defensive coordinator to succeed Lou Holtz, had a 100 percent graduation rate among his players last year.
