The New York Times/CBS News poll is based on interviews with a random sampling of Massachusetts voters as they left the polls yesterday. Fifteen voting precincts throughout the state were selected and, within each precinct, each voter had an equal chance of selection.

In all, 1,097 voters were interviewed, including 872 Democratic voters and 225 Republican voters.

One possible source of error in a survey such as this is sampling error. One can say with 95 percent certainty that results based upon the entire sample differ by no more than 4 points, in either direction, from what would have been obtained by interviewing all Massachusetts voters. Results based on Democrats alone are unlikely to err by more than 4 percent, and on Republicans alone by more than 7 percent.

However, as in any survey of public opinion, this margin of error is undoubtedly somewhat larger because of unavoidable imperfections in the way the survey was constructed, and because some voters refused to be interviewed.
