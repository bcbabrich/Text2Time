In choppy seas and high winds off the coast of Australia this week, the American racing yacht Courageous suffered a broken mast but no serious injuries to the crew other than to the winchman, Robert Anderson. He suffered a gashed forehead that needed stitches.

Courageous, the oldest racing 12-Meter yacht in the world, was off North Beach, Fremantle, when its 98-foot mast broke in 25-knot winds Monday. Training is under way there for the American Yale-Corinthian syndicate's America's Cup challenge to be held in early 1987, Anderson said the mast, which cost about $100,000, cracked about halfway up and fell outside the hull. ''We were sailing in a stiff breeze when we hit a wave a bit bigger than the others, and the mast just went,'' he explained.
