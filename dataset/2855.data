When Rangers right wing Matthew Barnaby saw Toronto's Owen Nolan elbow and punch defenseman Darius Kasparaitis last night, he decided he had to do something.

But well after the game ended, Barnaby still could not figure out why Referee Kerry Fraser decided to assess him an extra two minutes for roughing after he and Nolan exchanged blows.

On the power play that followed, Mats Sundin scored what turned out to be the winning goal in the Maple Leafs' 4-2 victory over the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Toronto (12-6-5-2) won its fifth straight game and ended the Rangers' four-game unbeaten streak.

Sundin's goal, at 17 minutes 57 seconds of the second period, came 34 seconds after Jan Hlavac tied the score at 2-2 with a power-play goal. Nolan was in the penalty box when Hlavac scored; once he was out, Barnaby challenged him to a fight.
