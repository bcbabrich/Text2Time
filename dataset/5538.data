Search teams sent remote-controlled cameras to the ocean floor today to determine whether an unidentified sunken object discovered by the Coast Guard is a large piece of wreckage from the space shuttle Challenger.

The underwater search is taking place about 40 miles east of Daytona Beach, in the same area where the Coast Guard Thursday recovered five large floating pieces of the shuttle itself, including a clearly identifiable section of the right side of the fuselage, adjacent to the crew compartment.

On that section the word ''Rescue'' was clearly visible, along with a yellow arrow pointing to a small hatch door to be used by the crew for escape in emergency landings at land or sea. The door is below the mid-deck section of the crew compartment, only about six feet from where Gregory B. Jarvis, a mission specialist on the flight, was seated.

No Word on Sunken Object

Mr. Jarvis was one of the seven people aboard the Challenger who died Tuesday when it exploded in a fireball over the Atlantic, shortly after it was launched here.
