Gov. William F. Weld is set to announce plans on Wednesday to consolidate the state's education agencies into one powerful board as part of an effort to shrink state government. And he wants a former political rival, John R. Silber, the president of Boston University, to run it.

"You need a lot of energy and aggressiveness to counteract the torpor of education," Mr. Weld said today in an interview at the Statehouse.

Under the Republican Governor's plan, which needs legislative approval before it can be put into effect, the education agencies would become a state Board of Education and Training. A plan to create such an agency in 1991 was defeated.

The current board, headed by a part-time volunteer chairman, Martin Kaplan, presides over policies on primary and secondary education in the state. If the latest plan is approved, the new board will eventually also make decisions about state colleges, adult education, and job placement and training programs, Governor Weld said. The chairman's position would probably remain part time and unpaid, officials said.
