'Why is the family so universally revered?" Henig asks. "Why do we admire people who choose spending time with their children over spending time at work?" Just who is this "we" she writes about? The majority of Americans no longer inhabit families out of "Father Knows Best," where Mom and Dad "choose" to spend time with their 2.6 children. And Bud and his sisters don't customarily lead lives chock-full of "orthodontist appointments, piano lessons and fencing classes." Instead, Mom is often divorced from Dad and getting little or no child support. She doesn't have the luxury of "choosing" to spend more time with the children because she's working a second job at minimum wage. ROBERT HERRIG Norwalk, Conn.
