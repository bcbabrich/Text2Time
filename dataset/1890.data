City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. released an audit on Tuesday morning finding that the Police Department’s Manhattan Property Clerk Division had “exhibited disturbingly poor controls over weapons in its custody — with many of them initially missing.”

The audit “found a stunning lack of organization, order and control,” Mr. Thompson said at a news conference in Lower Manhattan.



The Property Clerk Division safeguards property, including cash, narcotics, rifles and handguns. The property is categorized as arrest evidence, materials kept for investigative or safekeeping purposes, and the property of deceased individuals.

The department has established five Property Clerk Division offices, one in each borough, to accept and safeguard the property in custody. This audit focused on the Manhattan office and its controls over cash and firearms recovered from the 1999 to 2007 fiscal years.

The 33-page audit [pdf] found the handling of cash to be adequate, but identified problems in the handling of firearms:

Officials could not immediately account for or retrieve from storage 94 of the 324 sampled firearms brought in for safekeeping, even after several weeks.

The office failed to record pertinent information that would permit easy tracking of the firearms in its custody. For instance, logbooks were incomplete or had inaccurate information.

Rifles were stored “in a disheveled manner,” on the floor and in piles; some lacked identifying tags.

Firearms were kept by the office longer than required by police regulations, which require that firearms be reclaimed or disposed of after one year.

The office couldn’t accurately account for the number of firearms in its custody, since there are no written police procedures governing firearm inventories.

The division does not maintain an electronic database of property, relying on manual records. But the Police Department has chosen a contractor to build a Property Evidence Tracking System.

“It’s disgraceful that the N.Y.P.D. has let its weapons go AWOL,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement, adding, “Based on these conditions, there is limited assurance that firearms brought to the Manhattan P.C.D. office are safe, secure, and out of harms way.”

The audit made several recommendations, including revamping the rifle storage area; making sure that firearms are destroyed after a year, as the law requires; immediately creating an inventory of the firearms in the Manhattan office; creating written procedures that govern the tracking and proper return or destruction of firearms.

In a written response to the audit, Deputy Chief John P. Gerrish, the commander of the Office of Management Analysis and Planning at the Police Department, said he was “gratified” that the handling of cash was found to be adequate. He added, in part:

As for firearms, it is important to note that every firearm was also accounted for, albeit the fact that some required a prolonged effort to locate, given the fact that firearms may at times be removed from their original storage position for court appearances, destruction, etc.

Chief Gerrish said the department hoped to implement an automated tracking system for all property and had explored replacing the current fixed-shelving system with a “movable shelving system” that would increase storage capacity by as much as 60 percent.

Chief Gerrish said the department agreed with, or had already begun to address, all 13 of Mr. Thompson’s recommendations.
