If William Styron's memoir of battling depression, ''Darkness Visible,'' were retold by a plain-spoken baseball player out of a Ring Lardner story, the voice might sound a little like this:

''I felt very withdrawn. I felt very much to myself. The sleeping problem was back from the previous week, and there was a lot of anxiety. . . . I wasn't eating anything. I had a lot of things going together.''

These words are not fiction, however, but were actually spoken last week by Pete Harnisch, a pitcher for the New York Mets, as he told reporters why he had joined his team's disabled list. For a month, Harnisch had been battling a mystery ailment that had disrupted his sleep, eating patterns and game. When he gave up three back-to-back home runs on opening day after having pitched five scoreless innings, he linked his abrupt exhaustion to nicotine withdrawal; he'd just quit smokeless tobacco. But resuming tobacco chewing didn't stop his symptoms, which were then variously attributed to a thyroid condition and Lyme disease.

Finally a psychological examination cleared up the mystery, and Harnisch went public. ''I'd just like to let everybody know I've been diagnosed with depression,'' he said last Friday, in a press conference by speakerphone from his home, adding: ''I never really thought I'm a different person than normal. I never considered that. . . . It's hard to pinpoint exactly why it happened.''

Harnisch's poignant description of his symptoms and their hard-to-penetrate cause will surprise no one familiar with the dense, incapacitating fogs of clinical depression. What is surprising is to hear such candor from a professional athlete. Though we're used to sports stars detailing their substance-and-spousal-abuse problems, and though other pro athletes (notably in the N.B.A.) have been sidelined by depression, Harnisch's forthright articulation of his ailment is unusual in American public life, period. Irreproachable figures like Mr. Styron, Mike Wallace and Alma Powell talk publicly about their battles with depression -- but not middling 30-year-old major leaguers with careers on the line.
