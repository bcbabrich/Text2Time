More than a month after their homes were destroyed by a devastating earthquake, thousands of ill-clad and frightened villagers in the Himalayan foothills still huddle with their cattle for warmth under tents as rain -- snow in the higher mountains -- signals the onset of winter.

The survivors have lived in the open since Oct. 20, when an earthquake rumbled across a 70-mile belt in the foothills of the western Himalayas, destroying bridges, roads and villages.

More than 700 people were killed, officials at Uttarkashi, a major town in the region, have said. Relief workers said the number was at least 1,500.

District Magistrate Sunil Aggarwal said that the crucial factors in the next weeks would be the construction of snow-proof shelters and the providing of relief material, including food, blankets and medicines, to distant villages.
