Nets guard Joe Johnson returned to the lineup Friday against the Dallas Mavericks after a three-game absence caused by a left heel injury.

Johnson, who is second on the team in scoring, had started 55 straight games after joining Brooklyn in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks this summer. But he hurt his foot against Milwaukee on Feb. 20 and has been cautious about pushing it before it properly heals.

Nets General Manager Billy King characterized the injury as something similar to plantar fasciitis — inflammation of the plantar fascia tendon at the base of the foot. At the team’s shootaround on Friday morning, Johnson said the heel felt good enough to test.

“There’s a little soreness but today’s probably the best it’s felt in a long time,” Johnson said. “I was able to move without no problems. I just keep icing and treating it and hopefully it gets better.”

With Johnson healthy, the question once again is whether he and point guard Deron Williams can coexist productively in the Nets’ backcourt.

In Johnson’s absence, Williams averaged 24 points and 8 assists, both up noticably from his season averages. He scored 33 points against the New Orleans Hornets on Tuesday, including 11 in the fourth quarter, which has been a period that he has normally deferred to Johnson, one of the best clutch shooters in the league.

Williams said Friday morning, “If people are open, I’m going to get them the ball.”

He added: “It was only three games, not like he’s been gone for months. We’ll just plug him back in and get back to work.”

Johnson acknowledged that the Nets’ offense, which has swung through bouts of inconsistency this season, continues to be a work in progress.

“Right now we’re really trying to find our identity as a team and who we’re going to be going into the postseason,” Johnson said. “We’re just trying to keep guys healthy, get guys back healthy and see where it goes from there.”

It is clear Johnson’s presence makes Brooklyn a better team. He is a 38 percent 3-point shooter and a potent late-game scorer with two buzzer-beating shots already on his Nets résumé. He has made 9 of 10 field goals in the final minute of games decided by 3 points or less this season.

Coach P.J. Carlesimo said Johnson also helped the Nets on the defensive end, where his size (6 feet 7 inches) allows him to smother smaller shooting guards and also guard small forwards, like the Mavericks’ Shawn Marion.

“This is one where Joe helps us in the size standpoint,” Carlesimo said before Friday’s game. “It increases the possibilities defensively for us in terms of matchups.”

Carlesimo said Johnson’s minutes would probably be limited Friday, with the Nets playing again against Chicago on Saturday night. But in the fourth quarter of a close game, he will assuredly be on the floor.

Where was Cuban?

Williams flirted with signing with the Mavericks, his hometown team, in the off-season. In the fall, when discussing why he eventually signed a $98 million contract to stay with Brooklyn, Williams indicated that he was miffed that Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban did not show up for his recruitment meeting because he was shooting an episode of the reality television show “Shark Tank.”

“A lot of the questions that me and my agent had for them really didn’t get answered that day,” Williams said in October. “I think if he was there, he would have been able to answer those questions a little better.”

In a radio interview later, Cuban said the Mavericks — who signed Elton Brand, Darren Collison, O.J. Mayo and Chris Kaman — were “in a better position now than we would have been if we’d gotten” Williams.

This week, Williams would not entertain questions about the comments, saying only that he is pleased with the way things turned out.

“I’m happy where I’m at,” Williams said. “I wouldn’t change the decision now and I didn’t really think about it then. I’m happy being a Brooklyn Net.”
