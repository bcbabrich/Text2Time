When the leader of Turkey's surging Islamic party, Necmettin Erbakan, stepped onto an Ankara street this week after a meeting with business leaders, a cheering crowd quickly engulfed him. From windows high above, people began waving and chanting his name.

"What will you do if you are excluded from the new government?" a reporter asked him.

Mr. Erbakan paused for a moment to absorb the good will that was washing over him. Then he replied: "We won't do anything. We'll just sit back, drink our coffee, and enjoy the show."

Although he holds strongly Islamic political views, Mr. Erbakan is very different from Muslim militants who have emerged in the Middle East and North Africa. He challenges the resolute secularism on which Turkey has been based for more than 70 years, but embraces the country's commitment to peaceful politics.

Mr. Erbakan's Welfare Party finished first in the parliamentary elections held Dec. 24, taking slightly more than 21 percent of the vote. He would like to join the next coalition government, but most established politicians are treating him as a pariah.
