New Jersey now has the nation's second-highest percentage of parolees walking its streets, according to a Department of Justice study released yesterday. Only Pennsylvania had a higher number of parolees per 100,000 adults at the end of 1995.

In 1994, New Jersey ranked third behind Pennsylvania and Texas. But last year, the state's paroled population grew by 13.4 percent to 47,411. Mario Paparozzi, assistant chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Parole, said that prison overcrowding was putting pressure on state corrections officials to release inmates who qualify for parole.
