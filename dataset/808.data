WAXLER--Barbara Cushman, beloved wife, sister, mother, and daughter, died peacefully on June 3, 2013, surrounded by loved ones. An attorney for more than 50 years, she had been a resident of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where she practiced trusts and estates law. Barbara was raised in Brooklyn and, later, Larchmont, New York. She attended the Ethical Culture School and graduated from Adelphi Academy. She received her B.A. in Economics from Connecticut College for Women, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa, and received her LL.B. from Columbia University Law School, where she was one of the youngest graduates in the school's history. Following Columbia, she practiced law, was a member of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and attended medical school in New York City. She married Dr. Edward Bernard Waxler in June 1965. They lived in New York, Philadelphia, and, then, in Waycross, Georgia, where Dr. Waxler was a partner in a cardiology practice. Following her husband's death in 1977 at the young age of 37, Barbara relocated to the Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia with her two children, Andrew and Caroline. She was admitted to the bar in Pennsylvania. She is survived by her son, Dr. Andrew Reed Waxler (Laurie); grandchildren, Eric, Abigail, and Emily Waxler; daughter, Caroline Waxler Levitt (Michael); and sister, Joan Rosenberg.
