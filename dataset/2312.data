Is Time Warner still attached to AOL? That was the gist of a question that Credit Suisse analyst William Drewry threw to the media giant’s top executives in Wednesday’s earnings conference call. The query was partly inspired by recent comments from AOL chief executive Jonathan Miller to a British newspaper, in which he suggested that Time Warner might eventually consider splitting off the online unit.

The response to Mr. Drewry’s question was a tag-team effort from Time Warner president Jeff Bewkes and Time Warner chief executive Richard Parsons, who took turns praising AOL’s importance to the company but stopped short of calling it indispensable.

Mr. Parsons told The New York Times’ Richard Siklos that the early results of a new strategy to make AOL a free service financed by advertising fitted well with the company’s other advertising-supported businesses like cable networks and magazine publishing.

“As I sometimes say, ‘Everywhere it rains, I want to have a bucket,’ ” Mr. Parsons said. “We need to have this in our kit bag because this is where money is going.”

Mr. Bewkes said on the call that AOL is “definitely a core asset for the company and growing really well” and observed that Mr. Miller’s comments were made just after Time Warner shed some of its European Internet-access businesses. “We would all say that we always evaluate any alternatives that are more profitable in the long run,” Mr. Bewkes said. “The long run is key to making that assessment.”

On the call, Mr. Parsons went on at some length about how AOL helps Time Warner tie together the online initiatives of all its products, from People magazine to CNN to HBO.

“AOL,” Mr. Parsons said, “can be sometimes a partner in that and sometimes offer some assistance in terms of insights into that. But each of these businesses has to have its own strategy for how it is going to meld the digital opportunities the technologies present.”

“So,” he concluded, “I am not 100 percent sure exactly what musings that Jon Miller [expressed], but it is a core asset, and I think we have got it on the right track.”
