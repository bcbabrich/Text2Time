The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission has been given a preliminary triple-A rating by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. It is the first United States shelf offering by a Japanese company to be rated.

The Japanese company will be issuing bonds totaling 400 billion yen (about $3.2 billion now) over a one-year period. The proceeds will be used to buy property and equipment.

Nippon Telegraph was converted from a Government-owned domestic telecommunications monopoly to a private company in April 1985. A recently completed third public offering of 1.5 million shares has reduced the Government's ownership to about 65 percent. The Government is required to own at least one-third of Nippon's outstanding shares.
