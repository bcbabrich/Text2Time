MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — With West Virginia on the cusp of a spot in the national title game, Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese welcomed the opportunity to reminisce about some dark days for the league. Tranghese recalled that four years ago this weekend, Syracuse beat Boston College to put Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl. (The Panthers were blown out by Urban Meyer’s undefeated Utah team.) That moment capped a miserable season for the league, which had lost Virginia Tech and Miami to the A.C.C. and was slated to lose B.C. the next year.

“Four years ago to this day, we didn’t have a football league,” Tranghese said. “We were playing in limbo. It was the worst year you could imagine.”

The depths of those dark times for the league included a summer spent putting together a plan to dissolve the league. It also included some contentious meetings at the Newark Airport Marriott, where university officials had to be convinced it would be viable to keep the league together.

The five remaining members agreed to stick it out, and added Louisville, Cincinnati and South Florida. The rest, as they say, is current events.

Four years later, the league has gone from the brink of vanishing to the top of college football. West Virginia, with a victory tonight, will be the league’s first representative in the Bowl Championship Series title game since Miami lost to Ohio State in double-overtime at the end of the 2002 season.

As recently as three years ago, the league was fighting such a backlash of negativity that there was a movement, seemingly spearheaded by the Mountain West, for the Big East to lose its automatic B.C.S. bid. Now, that notion seems almost laughable.

“People don’t talk about it anymore,” Tranghese said. “We’ve done it. That’s what our goal was, right across the board.”

The turning point for the league came when West Virginia beat Georgia in the Sugar Bowl in Atlanta two years ago. From there, mainstream acceptance of the league’s viability has turned and it is being embraced as a player on the national scene.

“I believe the country realized that we were strong, viable contenders and deserving of B.C.S. affiliation,” the West Virginia athletic director Ed Pastilong said.
