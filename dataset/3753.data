He regrets allowing himself to be drawn into partisan political battles, like the one he touched off when he criticized Geraldine A. Ferraro on abortion. He regrets that he denounced Salman Rushdie without having even read ''The Satanic Verses.'' Most of all, John Cardinal O'Connor says, he regrets being so ''arrogant'' that he talked incessantly to the ever-insatiable news media, offering opinions on subjects he knew little about.

''I said some dumb things,'' said the most forceful and influential Archbishop of New York in a generation. ''The press could have asked me about satellites to Mars and I would have given them an answer.''

As he approaches his 77th birthday on Jan. 15, the Cardinal sounds very much like a man preparing to close out his career. He is, after all, two years beyond the official retirement age for bishops, reason enough for introspection.

But despite periodic eruptions of speculation about his future, the Cardinal has no plans to go anywhere just yet. He still loves his job, he feels fine, and he notes that he has assignments from the Vatican through 1997. His future is up to the Pope, who asked him to stay on past his 75th birthday, and has not said anything about retirement or succession.
