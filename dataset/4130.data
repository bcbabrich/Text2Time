Last year, just days after Freaknik, Mr. Campbell said things had gone well, apart from midtown traffic gridlock, and he admonished Atlanta residents that they could not build a fence around their city.

But in October, a spokesman for the Mayor said Atlanta was not the right place for Freaknik. And in later meetings with community groups, the Mayor talked of "zero tolerance" for law breaking.

Then in January the Mayor persuaded the presidents of the six historically black colleges of the Atlanta University Center -- Morehouse, Spelman and Morris Brown colleges, Clark-Atlanta University, Morehouse Medical School and the Interdenominational Theological Center -- to sign a letter to the presidents of other historically black campuses urging them to discourage their students' participation. Atlanta, the letter said, "is not the proper site for an event of this scope and magnitude."

Finally, in a meeting last week requested by students at the local black colleges, the Mayor softened his tone, saying the students would be welcome but would be expected to obey the law.

Dr. Samuel DuBois Cook, the president of Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, said he was disturbed by the letter and added, "I wonder what would happen if they were white college students."

In some ways Atlanta is grappling with the same issues faced by other traditional spring break destinations, including Fort Lauderdale and Daytona Beach in Florida. In the 1980's, when the numbers of vacationing college students, mostly white, began to overwhelm these communities, officials responded by tightening traffic control and enforcing standards of public conduct. Such tactics cooled the party fervor of students and shrank their numbers over the years until they returned to more manageable levels.

For many people who live near Piedmont Park, Freaknik is less a racial issue than one of noise, gridlock and inconvenience. Steve Brinkley, president of Midtown Neighbors, a group of residents who live near the park, said that the Mayor might have "tempered his words" in recent days, but that his strategy remains the same and that is to try to deflate the event over time.
