New York State's mandatory seat belt law - the first in the nation - went into effect today.

Drivers and front-seat passengers must wear seat belts or face fines of up to $50.

Drivers will be liable for any passengers under 16 who are not strapped in the front seat. Front-seat passengers over 16 will be personally liable for the penalties.

There will be a one-month grace period, until Jan. 1, before penalties are imposed.

Under an earlier law, children under 10 must be secured by a safety belt or a safety seat in either the front or back seats.

Taxicabs, school buses, emergency vehicles and commercial vans and trucks are exempt from the new law. Physicians can provide waivers to motorists or passengers who cannot wear seat belts for medical reasons. The automobile industry is selling adaptors for people too large or too small to be secured by a safety belt.
