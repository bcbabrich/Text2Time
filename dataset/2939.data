The nation will probably soon get to see and hear Coleen Rowley, the Minneapolis F.B.I. agent who has been widely lauded for her complaint that bureau officials in Washington brushed aside information about terrorist plans before Sept. 11, Congressional officials said today.

Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, both Republicans, asked the Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, to call Ms. Rowley to speak at a public hearing on Thursday about the F.B.I.'s performance.

Mr. Grassley said Ms. Rowley was agreeable to doing so as long as she was not asked about the case of Zacarias Moussaoui. He said she indicated that she was willing to speak ''on general matters such as the F.B.I.'s reorganization and cultural problems in the bureau, including careerism and fear of taking decisive action.''

Mr. Moussaoui, a 33-year-old flight student, was arrested last August on immigration charges after flight school supervisors reported that he had behaved suspiciously. Officials now say that he was to have been the 20th hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks.
