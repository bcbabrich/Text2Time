The law was changed two years ago to recognize international rights to trademarks, but the change does not apply retroactively. The United States wants the 1994 law amended in certain respects to more closely reflect international standards and, in effect, it wants the changes to be applied retroactively.

In an interview last week, Robin A. Rolfe, executive director of the International Trademark Association in New York, said her members were "encouraged by developments in the McDonald's case," in which an agency of the South African Government is siding with the Americans in trying to win back the name. Some companies, she said, are "pursuing discreet business-political negotiations or considering litigation."

She added, however, that while some South African companies were genuinely using the brands they registered, "in other cases, the real objective is blackmail" -- the South African owner simply wants the Americans to pay him off.

What follows are accounts of how four companies have fared in the fight to reclaim their names.

Ronald McDonald, Meet Mr. Sambonos

The battle is not over yet for McDonald's.

George Sambonos, owner of the Chicken Licken chain here, formed a partnership several years ago with Dax Properties, which owns a 20-year-old restaurant in downtown Durban called "Mac donald's," and together they registered the name McDonald's. They also registered the golden arches, Big Macs and the Ronald McDonald character that define the American fast-food giant.

Last year, as the real McDonald's -- the one based in Oak Park, Ill. -- was about to open its first branch here, Mr. Sambonos sued, saying it was infringing his trademark. He also hastily opened a burger outlet called McDonald's in a downtown Johannesburg storefront -- a dingy imitation that did not last long. It was marked by orders stuck to the wall with gummy paste and confused workers serving fries still raw at the center.

A local judge ruled that the American McDonald's had lost its trademarks, ignoring arguments that Mr. Sambonos's efforts to establish a hamburger chain were not serious.
