The Consumer Product Safety Commission said today that two of the biggest Internet auction sites had agreed to new safeguards to protect people from buying dangerous second-hand products via the Web.

The agency said the auction sites, eBay of San Jose, Calif., and Amazon.com Auctions of Seattle, had agreed to links with the commission's site to warn buyers and sellers about products that had been deemed hazardous, or in some instances even outlawed.

The commission ''can get these products off store shelves, but it is more difficult to get them out of people's homes,'' the commission chairwoman, Ann Brown, said today.

In a typical situation, she said, a family cleans out the basement or attic, getting rid of an old playpen or crib, and maybe the lawn darts from picnics of yore. The family holds a garage sale, unaware that the playpen or crib is of a type previously found hazardous, unaware that lawn darts were banned outright in 1988 after several people were fatally speared.
