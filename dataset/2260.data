“After terrible suffering and great travails, King Jamshid climbed up to Zabulistan.”

This fairy tale line comes from an 11th-century cycle of epic poetry that is as vital to Persian civilization as Homer’s poetry is to Greece. What startled me when I first read it was the place name, repeated again and again: not some great city in the Iranian heartlands like Babylon, but Zabulistan – the tract of desolate frontier that stretches north and east from Kandahar.

The “Shahnameh” cycle celebrates a dynasty of mythic heroes, whose fiefdom is Zabulistan and whose exploits glorified the kingdom of Iran and protected it from its northern enemies. But the poetry is studded with examples of the champions’ testy independence, even when performing great feats in the service of their kings. In one of the most celebrated episodes, Rustam, the chief hero, kills the crown prince in battle rather than be carried to court in fetters.

Through such symbolism, the poems reflect the legendary – and to a large degree real – unconquerability of the region that is now southern and eastern Afghanistan.

Some 500 years before the “Shanameh” was written, the Muslim conquests transformed the eastern Mediterranean region – and much of the world – forever after. The Arab tribesmen who burst forth from their desert on camels, armed with little more than the egalitarian precepts of their new religion, swept away two empires, almost toppled a third, and founded a polity that reached from Spain to the borders of India. But they could not reduce Zabulistan. Chronicles from the period detail fierce fighting on the frontier between the Muslim ghazis and the pagan subjects of Zabulistan. To this day, Afghans – whose name, to some, is now synonymous with inflexible adherence to conservative Islam – are proud of their forefathers’ resistance to the companions of the Prophet Muhammad.

Eventually (in the mid-900’s), a local fellow – a brigand and son of a coppersmith from a village 200 miles west of Kandahar – opened Zabulistan to Islam. At a victory feast one night, the court poet began singing his praises, in Arabic as usual. “Why should I have to listen to this stuff I can’t even understand?” the conqueror supposedly interrupted, ordering up verses in his native Persian, which until then had been only a vernacular.

This helped launch another kind of revolution: a cultural revolution, which led to the composition of the “Shahnameh.” It was an explosion of creativity in literature, art and architecture, in science, manners, thought and style that conquered the Arab Muslim conquerors of the Iranian plateau and spread eastward over the next half-millennium to the borders of China. This cultural efflorescence defines Afghanistan’s character as surely as the country’s fierce adoption of the religion of Islam does.

Although Afghanistan almost brought the Muslim conquests to a standstill; although it maintained, in the 19th century, a difficult independence from both Russia and imperial Britain; and although, a century later, it staved off the Soviet Red Army, the country has been conquered. Indeed, devastating, earth-gutting conquest – as much as Afghanistan’s legendary independence – defines the country’s character, too.

The most traumatic defeat came in the first quarter of the 13th century at the hands of Genghis Khan and his Mongols, who laid waste to great swaths of two continents. Again, Afghanistan almost held them off. A prince named Jalal ad-Din, whose father had five years earlier bequeathed him its lands, did what no other leader in those parts had dared. He attacked the Mongols. And in a mighty battle north of Kabul, he beat them. But then, that legendary Afghan unruliness intruded: the two wings of the prince’s multiethnic army fought over the division of spoils and the honor that went with them, and half the troops deserted. Jalal ad-Din retreated to the Indus River, where the Mongols caught up with him and destroyed what was left of his army. Then they overran the future Afghanistan.

Genghis Khan’s imitator Tamerlane repeated the process a century and a half later, tearing up the carefully irrigated breadbasket west of Kandahar, which to this day remains mostly desert. Yet once again, Persian culture conquered its conquerors. Tamerlane’s son established his capital in Herat (now on Afghanistan’s western border), where there soon flourished an unparalleled school of Persian painting, whose artists frequently illustrated the “Shahnameh” cycle.

This dogged determination to rise again from the ashes, this stubborn cleaving to life and beauty and imagination, gives me hope for Afghanistan even now.

Through each tumultuous epoch, the city of Kandahar marked the frontier – between Islam and paganism and between the Iranian plateau and the Indian subcontinent. Kandahar has been the cusp. You can see this place as an implacable barrier, or you can see it as the place where the barrier is pierced, a valve that channels a flow of people, ideas, merchandise and wisdom. That is the role I would choose for Kandahar and Afghanistan.
