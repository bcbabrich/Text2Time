A r m c h a i r quarterbacks across the nation will get their annual television bonan‐ za today‐six hours of uninterrupted football.

The Orange, Sugar and Cotton Bowls are scheduled to begin at 1:45 P.M., New York time, and end about 4:45, the time the Rose Bowl is supposed to start.

When all this is over, at about 7:45, the living‐room strategist will have masterminded eight teams through four games and himself through a maze of commercials.

The games are expected to draw an in‐person audience of 330,000 plus millions of television viewers.
