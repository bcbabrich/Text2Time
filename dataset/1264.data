Carl Banks was a hard-hitting All-Pro linebacker for Giants teams that won two Super Bowls. Off the field, he was one of the best-dressed athletes around town. Banks, who retired as a player in 1995, is an analyst on Giants radio broadcasts, a commentator on WFAN and a host on Sirius Radio. He recently started an apparel line with N.F.L. team logos for Lord & Taylor stores.

Q.

How did you become interested in designing clothes?

A.

A. I always loved fashion. Playing in New York, I always enjoyed Madison Avenue and looking in windows of stores like Barneys. I was one of the first athletes to endorse Starter, the sports fashion company started by David Beckerman. He was my mentor and hero. He took the culture of sports and fused it into fashion.

Q.

How long have you been involved in the clothing business?

A.

I put together my first sample line back in 1988, showed it around and received a great response. I was granted a limited license from the National Football League at that time. Since then, it has grown into something full scale, G-III Sports by Carl Banks.

Q.

What aspects of the line do you oversee?

A.

Every phase. I have a full staff, but I still do the designing. I’m involved from concept to production to marketing. From mind to market.

Q.

What clothes designed by other companies do you like?

A.

Prps because I’m a denim snob. I like G-Star; it’s a fun brand for me. And I’m very fond of Joseph Abboud and I’m a fan of his work. He used to let me sit in on some of his design meetings. His process is so wonderful.

Q.

You were recently featured with your line on the Home Shopping Network. How did you do on a station that has had Susan Lucci, Paula Abdul and Tori Spelling selling their wares?

A.

Pretty good. I sold about 32,000 retro hoodies in a 22-hour span.

Q.

Did you feel slighted that you were not included in the Giants’ Ring of Honor at New Meadowlands Stadium?

A.

I didn’t spend much time on it. The Giants have a legacy of great players. I know without a doubt that my contributions have always been greatly appreciated by the organization. In due time, if there’s another opportunity, I’m sure they’ll consider it. But I didn’t feel slighted. If it doesn’t happen, I know the organization appreciates my contribution to its success.

Q.

Will there be a lockout in the N.F.L. next season?

A.

I think it will be the dumbest thing to happen if the players and their union can’t find a way to work this out. There’s so much at stake. If it happens, football will recover, but I don’t know if the players will recover. Businesses will be hurt, mine included. There is so much prosperity in the league now, there is a healthy compromise in there somewhere. It’s a league of haves and have-nots. The guys with the $20 million signing bonuses will be O.K. But the guys who have short careers — the average life span of a pro football player is 3.4 years — there are a lot of those guys who just can’t withstand a lockout.

Q.

What players do you enjoy watching?

A.

I like the 49ers’ Patrick Willis a lot. I think he’s one fine linebacker. I love watching the Pittsburgh Steelers play football. Ahmad Bradshaw is just an exciting football player. He can make something out of nothing. He’s an explosive runner. And I like watching Tom Brady play.
