Dr. William R. (Reyn) Archer III is the health commissioner for the state of Texas. He got into trouble a few weeks ago when, in an interview with The Times, he made some untoward remarks about Hispanics and teen pregnancy.

The remarks proved embarrassing to Gov. George W. Bush, who has been running from one photo-op to another, posing relentlessly with black and brown children and teenagers, trying to show that he and his party are not the mortal enemies of ethnic minorities.

(The governor's task is not an easy one when you consider that Ronald Reagan chose to kick off his 1980 general election campaign in Philadelphia, Miss., which is where the civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney were murdered, and that the governor's own father, George Herbert Walker Bush, pumped up his win over Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race with the loathsome Willie Horton ads.)

So George W. does what he can to put a friendlier face on the G.O.P., and then he picks up The Times and sees that his man, Reyn Archer, is blaming the sky-high teen pregnancy rate in Texas on the fact that Hispanics lack the cultural belief ''that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
