In his speech at the New York auto show on Wednesday, Dave McCurdy, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, praised the rules regulating auto fuel economy and tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions that were completed on Thursday. And on the floor of the show, Jim Kliesch, senior engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, praised them, too.

The alliance and environmental groups have sometimes been at odds, but on the model year 2012-16 federal rules that will produce a standard of 35.5 miles per gallon (or 250 grams per mile of carbon dioxide) by 2016, they’re generally in agreement. The alliance likes the rules because they meet automakers’ need for a single standard, rather than a hodgepodge of conflicting federal, state and regional mandates that Mr. McCurdy said would be a “compliance nightmare.”

In a news conference on Thursday, Lisa Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said the new rules, to cost automakers about $52 billion, will stimulate the development of clean cars. Although mention of the mandates didn’t make it into many of the speeches accompanying new model introductions, it’s clear from the many hybrids and electric cars that automakers are thinking about them.

The new rules are, of course, complicated, and automakers can get credit toward the fuel economy/emissions goals if they reach other targets involving the production of flex-fuel vehicles or the use of cleaner air-conditioning refrigerants. Smaller, niche automakers also receive credits that are gradually reduced over the mandate period.

Walking the show floor with Mr. Kliesch, he stopped short in front of the relatively unassuming 2011 Chevrolet Cruze Eco, which goes on sale late this year and achieves 40 miles per gallon on the highway without hybrid drive. The Cruze Eco, he said, is a “dark horse” that demonstrates the advantage of returning to fundamentals, including efficient engine and transmission technology, reduced weight and improved aerodynamics. Mr. Kliesch called it “the car of the show.”

Other new cars that got a second look from Mr. Kliesch included coming hybrids from Lexus (CT 200h), Porsche (Cayenne S Hybrid) and Lincoln (MKZ Hybrid). “There’s a wide range of vehicle types seeking hybridization,” he said. Mr. Kliesch also cited the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid as a worthy contender and praised the company’s overall effort to replace V-6 engines with smaller-displacement power plants, some with turbocharging.

Finally, Mr. Kliesch says he pays close attention to how many green cars manufacturers plan to build. He wonders how many Americans will line up to buy the CT 200h, for instance. “They need to be sold in volume to play a significant environmental role,” he said. “Some of these programs are pretty small.”
