The change in accounting rules, plus losses totaling $372 million in 1988 and 1989, left Goldome at the end of 1990 with a negative capital position of $452.4 million. Although the company was insolvent under accounting rules, banking regulators allowed it to stay in business while new management returned it to profitability and searched for fresh capital. Changing Approach

After Thomas A. Cooper, a former president of the BankAmerica Corporation, became chairman two years ago, Goldome cut non-interest expenses to $255 million in 1990 from $438 million in 1989, and began to concentrate on collecting deposits and making loans to middle-income consumers in the Buffalo area, where 35 percent of the households have an account with the bank.

As part of its effort to make a turnaround, Goldome sold 24 branches with $2.8 billion of deposits in the New York City area to the Manufactures Hanover Trust Company during late 1989 and earlier this year.

Because of the strong position of Goldome in the Buffalo area, and its return to profitability -- the company earned $37.5 million in 1990 -- Mr. Cooper said earlier this year that the company was "worth much more than is shown on its balance sheet." Search for Investors

But Mr. Cooper's efforts to assemble a group of investors were unsuccessful, and other potential buyers, including GE Capital, decided against investing in the company. Investment bankers said many other banks were interested in Goldome, but none could compete with Keycorp and First Empire, which had the advantage of local branch networks that could be economically merged with Goldome's system.

Keycorp and First Empire, which agreed to add $195 million and $40 million of capital, respectively, to their banking units, face limited risk of loss because the F.D.I.C. agreed to take about $1.8 billion of loans and other assets from Goldome subsidiaries, as well as $400 million of weak loans from Goldome's Buffalo savings bank.

In addition, the two companies may return for three years any Goldome loans that turn bad. To attract the two buyers, the F.D.I.C. agreed to pay $163 million to Keycorp and $40 million to First Empire, a Keycorp official said.

Keycorp and First Empire previously collaborated in 1989 in the purchase of branches and deposits of the Empire of America Corporation, another Buffalo savings bank that ran into trouble during the 1980's, when it expanded outside its local market.
