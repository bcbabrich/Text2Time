“Tess of the d’Urbervilles,” which had its premiere on the BBC in September, takes Hardy’s tale of the proud and pure country girl brought down by Victorian mores and gives it the sensitive-strings-and-postcard-cinematography treatment. The tragedy is all there to be seen, but it’s rarely there to be felt.

In its early stages the film is so concerned with cramming in all the novel’s plot points that the scenes flash by like a headline montage: Drunk Father! Mail Coach! Dead Horse! Eventually, of course, it’s impossible to transcribe the novel faithfully, even across four hours, and the liberties taken by the adapters — the screenplay is by David Nicholls, who wrote the novel and film “Starter for 10” — are instructive. Every significant change serves not just to streamline the story but also to sentimentalize Hardy’s thorny characters, and to rationalize their sometimes puzzling behavior.

Invented scenes of Tess breaking down in front of Mrs. d’Urberville after her night in the forest with Alec, or of Tess skipping down the hill on her way to work at the dairy, are clearly meant to enlist our sympathy for a character who’s not always easy to love in the novel. Hardy’s great harvest scene, where Tess labors all morning tying sheaves of grain and then takes a break to nurse her baby in the field, is here changed to a gooey panorama of Tess standing on a hillside above the sea (more photogenic, apparently, than the inland valley of the book) watching the May Day dance she once took part in.

The embellishments cross the line from irritating to laughable when Tess and Alec d’Urberville (amusingly played by Hans Matheson as a 19th-century version of Chuck Bass, the “Gossip Girl” character) have their fateful encounter in the woods, a moment that Hardy left entirely to his readers’ imaginations. The filmmakers insist on showing it to us, but manage to maintain Hardy’s ambiguity — rape or seduction? — through the liberal use of dry ice and dim lighting.

I could go on — for instance, about the importance of pre-Christian beliefs to the texture of the book and how the film dutifully, and yet completely bewilderingly, brings Tess to Stonehenge for her denouement — but that would be more abuse than this middlebrow potboiler deserves. And there is at least one reason to watch: Gemma Arterton, the “Quantum of Solace” Bond girl, is a lovely and appealing Tess. In a different film, she might have been a complicated and tragic Tess as well.
