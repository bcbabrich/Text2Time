By all rights, this should be the perfect time to be a woman in medicine.

The days of women toiling as a mostly unwelcome presence in the country's medical schools are long over: women now account for roughly 45 percent of all medical students, up from about 25 percent in 1980.

And once they graduate, they are in high demand: many patients, especially women, now request female doctors because, among other reasons, they are perceived as spending more time with patients. Further, women's health issues -- breast and ovarian cancer most prominently -- are front and center in medical research and political agendas, fostering star-studded fund-raisers, road races and the like in every major city in the country.

But despite these gains, the top tiers of medicine have remained inaccessible to many women, largely, experts say, because they are unwilling or unable to find a balance between the years of study those specialties require and a life outside of medicine.

''Basically, the picture is bad,'' said Dr. Wendy Chavkin, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. ''Women comprise very few dean and tenured faculty positions, and there are a lack of them in surgical specialties.'' The main reason, Dr. Chavkin said, is that in medicine, ''there are still issues about career pathways that are the least bit off track, like taking time off for child rearing.''
