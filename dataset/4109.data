Jeffrey Babcock, a founder of the New World Symphony in Miami and the director of the Cultural Olympiad, seems entirely comfortable with its mix of funk, flash, grit and show biz. "What we're doing is different than creating and presenting a free-standing independent arts festival," said Mr. Babcock, who was in Los Angeles with the Philharmonic when the 1984 Summer Olympics were held in that city. "Our mission is to enhance the overall Olympic experience, to be an important add-on component of the Games experience. You can't compare this with a festival like Spoleto."

Similarly, Mr. Rifkin of the High Museum said he was not worried about the art world sniping at "Rings." "If people want to call it hokey, that's fine," he said. "I know there will be critics no matter what you do. But if it works to bring people to begin to see and appreciate works of art of different cultures it will be very successful. It's trying to be populist in spirit, and it's only because of the Olympics that we have the opportunity to do it."

On the surface, art and athletics may not have much to do with each other, but in fact from the time of ancient Greece the Olympics have integrated sports and culture. The form has varied in recent years. In Los Angeles, a small group hired by the Olympic organizers put on the cultural festivities, which were criticized locally as lacking in community involvement. In Barcelona, Spain, organization of the Cultural Olympiad was kept entirely separate from that of the Olympics, as a way to enhance its artistic independence. But its organizers ran out of money six months before the Games started, and many people felt the cultural events that did take place were difficult to find.

Atlanta has tried to involve as many people as possible from the city and regional art communities. And in keeping with its "run it like a business" civic ethic, it has taken a route opposite to that taken by Barcelona. Planning of the cultural programs is fully integrated into the planning of the Olympics, to such a degree that visitors will be able to buy a package that might include the javelin throw, women's basketball, the Atlanta Symphony and the Dallas Black Dance Theater.

That approach has helped with fund-raising and efficiency, but it has at times led to clashes between the Olympic organizers and the local arts community. Many kinks have been ironed out, but some in Atlanta's arts world still see the organizers, including Billy Payne, the president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, as intrusive micromanagers with no feeling for art.

"There's a narrowness of vision there," said one cultural figure who would only speak anonymously. "They see art as a dangerous business. It could be controversial."
