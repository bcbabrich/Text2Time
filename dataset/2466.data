A Florida investor is seeking to block a $195 million preliminary settlement between tax shelter investors and KPMG, and to disqualify the settlement's lawyers over what he calls a major conflict of interest.

The investor, Mark Kottler of Boca Raton, Fla., argued in a brief filed in federal court in Newark on Thursday that lawyers at Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman negotiated the settlement on behalf of separate plaintiffs in a class action against KPMG.

According to the brief, those "secret negotiations," which Mr. Kottler said he was never informed of, compromised a separate lawsuit filed on Mr. Kottler's behalf by Milberg Weiss against KPMG in a Florida state court in early 2004 on the same abusive tax shelters.

Melvyn Weiss of Milberg Weiss said yesterday that his firm "would vigorously oppose their seeking to stay our settlement."
