United States officials decided not to wait for the final report on what caused an engine of a Boeing 737 to explode during take-off in Manchester, England, two and a half weeks ago. The Federal Aviation Administration last week ordered the inspection of Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15 engines, the type involved.

They are on a fourth of the jetliners operating in the United States.

In Britain, about 60 airliners, 10 percent of the country's fleet, were ordered checked after the disaster, which killed 54 people on board. Investigators found cracks in the combustion chambers of some of the engines, and British Airways is repairing four of its Boeing 737's.

Experts said it takes eight hours and three mechanics to check one engine, but the F.A.A. said it did not expect flights to be disrupted ''to any significant degree.''

For one thing, a substantial number of the 2,000 planes involved could be exempt from inspection if they are part of an F.A.A. engine monitoring program. Although about 80 percent of the jetliners in the United States are powered by Pratt & Whitney engines, the order covers only the series 15 model of the JT8D in Boeing 737's and 727's and McDonnell Douglas DC-9's.
