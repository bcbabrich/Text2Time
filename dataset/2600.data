Suffolk County prosecutors investigating how more than $750,000 was taken from the William Floyd School District have begun to explore relationships between school officials and local Republican organizations, a spokesman for the district attorney said Wednesday.

''It's a school district that does have some political coloring,'' said Bob Clifford, a spokesman for Thomas Spota, a Democrat and the Suffolk district attorney. ''They're definitely looking at it.''

Prosecutors said they have noticed a number of odd and unlikely connections between educators and Republican organizations for Suffolk County and the town of Brookhaven, like political donations, school contracts and a political aide who received a job in the school district.

And the man who first pointed investigators toward the William Floyd School District was not a disgruntled teacher or outraged parent, but a disgraced former Suffolk legislator, Fred Towle, a politically connected Republican who pleaded guilty in May 2003 to taking more than $10,000 in bribes.
