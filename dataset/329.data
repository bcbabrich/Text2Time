The ministry runs the program. But the law that set it up requires participants to join and help finance a nonprofit, AdvantageBC, established in 1986 to promote British Columbia as a business destination. AdvantageBC advises its members on how to benefit from the tax breaks. The involvement of this group has also become a target for critics.

“There is no reason for this organization to be outside of government,” said Duff Conacher, a founder of Democracy Watch, a Canadian civic organization, “except to escape the ethics, transparency and accountability requirements government institutions have to face.”

Colin Hansen, a former provincial finance minister who helped expand the program’s tax incentives in 2010, is president and chief executive of AdvantageBC. He defended the group’s involvement in the tax-break program. “On all issues, we are fully accountable to our members, which is where that accountability should be,” he said in an email.

As finance minister, Mr. Hansen repeatedly declared that expanding the program would help attract companies doing international business and “create those jobs in British Columbia.”

In a recent interview, though, he said that its goal was really to enlarge the local financial services sector. “The program was not actually set up to be a job creator,” he said.

Mr. Hansen said most of the companies listed as “core members” on the group’s website were registered in the program. But he also said that some companies joined the group before seeking the benefits. He declined to provide a complete list of businesses. “Some companies are a little more sensitive about being included,” he said.

It is unclear which businesses listed on AdvantageBC’s website are in the program and receiving tax breaks. But a company must be a core member to get the refunds.
