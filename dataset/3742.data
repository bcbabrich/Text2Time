A man with a rifle held officers at bay for more than two hours near a busy intersection in East Northport yesterday before surrendering without firing a shot, the Suffolk County police said.

The incident blocked traffic and forced cancellation of bus service to three nearby East Northport public schools until shortly before 5 P.M., when the police announced that the standoff had ended. Several people evacuated from nearby homes were able to return. No one was reported injured.

The man, Scott Gillespie, who the police said had an arrest record and a history of mental illness, was suicidal, according to Sgt. Vincent Ward of the Suffolk County police.

Officers detonated a stun grenade in the woods where the gunman was standing to distract him, and Mr. Gillespie surrendered, he said.
