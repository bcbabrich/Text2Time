After I posted on Twitter to promote a fine Times story about a Missouri flood victim, a reply* directed my attention to a column by Tony Messenger in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showing, yet again, how communities ignore inconvenient hydrological and geophysical realities:



Pied Piper of failed river policies saw this flood coming

The flood maps are all wrong.

The old water marks on grain elevators are meaningless.

This was the message Washington University geology professor Bob Criss presented to a small room of environmentalists, water experts and river rats at Union Station just a few months before the December floodwater came to St. Louis. We were both there to speak of an ongoing problem in our region: the failure to learn lessons from past floods.

Criss gave a preview of his paper, published later in the Journal of Earth Science, arguing that the statistical methods used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to define flood risk are outdated. Talk of 100-year or 500-year floods is meaningless, as are some of the flood plain maps, Criss said. The frequency of major flooding events, in part due to climate change but greatly due to bad river management, are increasing. The old math, he argued, needs some new equations.

Months later, as rising water tops interstates, threatens levees and swallows towns such as Pacific and Union and West Alton, Criss has another message that many won’t want to hear:

This is our fault.

“The Mississippi River should not be going crazy after three days of rain,” Criss told me Wednesday morning.

Here, the Great Flood of 1993 is a good comparison, not because the high-water records are about to be broken, but because that flood was so different.

“1993 was a slow-moving monster,” Criss said. Water levels built upstream in the Missouri and Mississippi for days and weeks and months, moving slowly to each new city in its path. They behaved, mostly, as big rivers are supposed to, slowly building, taking in massive amounts of water, and searching for flood plain to relieve its swollen banks.

Eventually, relief came, from the river’s perspective at least, when it broke through the Monarch Levee and flooded the Gumbo Bottoms in what is now known as the Chesterfield Valley.

After that flood, a federally commissioned report, led by Gen. Gerald Galloway of the Army Corps of Engineers, suggested massive changes to federal flood policy. Key to the suggestions were the need to allow the Missouri and Mississippi to connect more naturally to their flood plains, which meant reducing development in low-lying areas.

St. Louis, and most of the nation, it seems, didn’t listen.
