In a volatile day of trading, the bond market ended slightly weaker yesterday with yields rising. Only the price of the 30-year bond managed to eke out a small gain, which pushed its yield down from 6.11 percent Monday to 6.09 percent, just above the 20-year low reached last week.

The report that the economy grew at a revised 1.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter, after adjustment for inflation, had little impact, although the economic pace was higher than many forecasters had expected.

Since the Commerce Department reported two weeks ago a surprisingly large jump in the June trade deficit, in large part because of declining exports, many forecasters had said growth would slow in the second quarter to close to 1 percent. The initial Government report on the growth of the gross domestic product, which was released a month ago, was 1.6 percent.

The expectation that the second-quarter growth would be slower than initially reported bolstered the view that there was little chance that inflation, now rising at a slower pace than last yrear, would accelerate any time soon. And this view had helped the prices of both the 30-year bonds and shorter-term Treasury securities rally in the last two weeks.
