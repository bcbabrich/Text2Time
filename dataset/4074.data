If the Giants are to have any chance of making the playoffs, it starts on Sunday against visiting Arizona. Lose here, and the team's overall record falls to 3-6. The more important numbers for the Giants, however, have to do with the division. The Giants are looking for their first National Football Conference East victory this year. They are off to an 0-4 start in the N.F.C. East for the first time since 1979.

Losing in your division can ruin a season. Take that 1979 season, for example. That Giant team did poorly in its division and finished at 6-10.

''That's one of the most disappointing things so far this year, that we are 0-4 in the N.F.C. East,'' said Giants quarterback Dave Brown. ''Obviously, we want to change that as quickly as we can. This is a great chance to get that wrong corrected.''

The division games the Giants have lost are at Dallas, two against Washington and to Philadelphia at home. After playing the Cardinals, the Giants play Carolina before heading to Arizona to play the Cardinals again. If the Giants can sweep Arizona, they can drastically improve their N.F.C. East standing. Of course, the Giants still have games left against Dallas and Philadelphia.
