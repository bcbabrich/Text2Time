The Los Angeles Raiders, always proud to be a dysfunctional family, are seeing it backfire. Today, Coach Art Shell said his 0-4 team was switching offensive choreographers, and this is just after he swapped quarterbacks two weeks ago.

"Wish I could suit up, but I know I can't," said Shell, a Hall of Fame tackle.

Terry Robiskie, a former Raider running back, will be replaced as the lead offensive coach by Tom Walsh, a former college baseball player.

The rufflings go on and on. In training camp, Elvis Patterson, a special-teams star, body-slammed the frail 54-year-old secondary coach, Jack Stanton. Then, starting defensive end Scott Davis retired in his prime to go for his real-estate license.

Another starting defensive end, Greg Townsend, held out until the eve of the season opener and running back Marcus Allen has tugged on owner Al Davis's polyester Raider jacket and asked to be traded.
