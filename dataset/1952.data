This is the last meal. But you don’t get to pick anything you want. In fact, Sunday’s breakfast menu is limited to the standard lineup of surrogates.

David Plouffe, Senator Barack Obama’s campaign manager, is on “Fox News Sunday,” and his counterpart on Senator John McCain’s campaign, Rick Davis, is on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.” Mr. Stephanopoulos will also interview David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s top strategist. Mr. Axelrod will also appear on CBS’s “Face the Nation” with Senator Lindsey Graham, Mr. McCain’s top surrogate. Senator Charles E. Schumer, who is leading Democrats’ efforts to win a filibuster-proof majority, appears with Senator John Ensign, his Republican counterpart.

NBC’s “Meet the Press” has two former presidential candidates: Senator John Kerry and Fred D. Thompson.

CNN’s “Late Edition” has a face-off with Pennsylvania’s two senators, Bob Casey, a Democrat, and Arlen Specter, a Republican. Four governors are also booked: Tim Kaine of Virginia, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Deval Patrick of Massachusetts.

You do get one special treat: Mr. McCain is expected to appear on “Saturday Night Live.”
