NEW DELHI, Sept. 30—The United States signed an agreement here today to provide India with $398 million worth of food grains and edible oil under the Food for Peace program.

The agreement covers pledges already made to India to help meet the current food crisis, which has forced up the price of wheat by more than 30 per cent since May.

The agreement, covering the fiscal year ending next June 30, was signed by Joseph N. Greene Jr., United States minister‐counselor, and P. Govindan Nair, Secretary of the Finance Ministry.

The United States promised to provide four million tons of wheat, 300,000 tons of rice and 75,000 tons of soybean oil.
