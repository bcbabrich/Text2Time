"There were two men standing on a piece of wooden scaffolding wedged between two steel tubes that had not fallen, and they were screaming, 'Get us down!' " Mr. Gottfried said.

The mechanics said they went up to the level where the men were standing, opened a nearby door and cut through an asbestos containment tent to reach the men and help pull them to safety.

An Emergency Medical Services spokesman, Robert F. Leonard, said seven workers were removed quickly and taken to Staten Island University Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. They had injuries to their backs, legs and arms, he said. Two Workers Trapped

Two workers were trapped for a time beneath the latticework of steel and wood. Rescuers had to shore up the debris as they cut away parts with power saws and torches. The first man was removed in about 35 minutes, fire officials said, but the second, buried beneath 30 feet of debris, was trapped for more than three hours.

Both men talked to their rescuers throughout the ordeal.

The last worker removed was treated at the scene before he was taken to the Staten Island hospital. He had "crushing injuries to his legs and abdomen and was suffering from hypothermia, since it was very cold inside the boiler," Mr. Leonard said.
