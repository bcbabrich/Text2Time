with announcement of the deal

Charming Shoppes, the owner of the Lane Bryant line of women’s clothing stores, has agreed to sell itself to a rival, the Ascena Retail Group, for about $890 million, the companies said Wednesday.

Under the terms of the transaction, Ascena will pay $7.35 a share, a nearly 25 percent premium to Charming Shoppes’ closing price on Tuesday.

The merger would unite two players in the specialty-women’s clothing industry. The standout brand between the two companies is Lane Bryant, the well-known retailer of plus-size women’s clothing that has been crucial to its parent’s growth. The line reported a 3 percent rise in same-store sales during the company’s most recent fiscal year, to $991.8 million. And with American waistlines growing larger, the business is expected to remain strong.

Shares in Charming Shoppes have climbed more than 30 percent over the past 12 months.

Lane Bryant’s growth is likely what drew the attention of Ascena, the 50-year-old retailer formerly named Dress Barn, after one of its clothing lines. Based in Suffern, N.Y., the company runs some 2,500 stores under the Dress Barn, Maurices and Justice brands and has a market value of about $2.9 billion.

Late last year, Charming Shoppes disclosed a plan to begin a strategic review of its businesses, a tacit admission that it was exploring a sale. In that announcement, the company said that it was looking to shed Fashion Bug, its worst-performing division. During the most recent fiscal year, Fashion Bug reported a 4 percent decline, to $581.6 million.

Shares in Charming Shoppes rose about 22 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal online reported on the impending merger.
