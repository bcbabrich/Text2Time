Workers are rolling out the grass, installing light fixtures and testing the water valves on the long-awaited $5 million African Burial Ground Memorial, at Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattan, just a few blocks north of City Hall.

The completion of the memorial, which will formally open to the public in a Friday ceremony, is the culmination of a nearly 16-year process that started when human remains were discovered during a 1991 excavation for the expansion of a federal building at 290 Broadway.

“It’s been a struggle,” said Rodney Leon, 38, the designer of the memorial, who first submitted his proposal in 1997. “But nothing compared to that of the people that are buried here.” The opening ceremony will start at the Statue of Liberty, and then continue to Bowling Green, where the public will be invited to march up toward the memorial.

The 15,000 square-foot plot where the memorial is situated is but a small remnant of an expansive burial ground that served as the final resting place for enslaved and free Africans from the 1690s to the 1790s. As many 15,000 are buried in what is considered the largest colonial-era cemetery for blacks in the United States. The remains of 419 men, women and children that were excavated were reinterred in 2003 in seven carved wooden crypts. All the bodies were discovered with their heads to the west and their feet to the east, so the memorial itself is oriented along an east-west axis, off the Manhattan grid.

Located in the shadow of a host of federal buildings, the site is sandwiched between three barricades protected by security guards. “It’s certain the most secure site in all of New York,” said Howard Dodson, the director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, who played a key role in getting the memorial to this point.

The African Burial Ground was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Last year, President Bush signed a law that made the site a national monument, to be maintained in perpetuity by the National Park Service.

The granite memorial has seven design elements – including a map of the world centered on Africa, a triangular structure meant to emulate the ship passage from Africa to the New World, and a spiral wall of 20 religious symbols from the African diaspora including images from Egypt, Haiti, Cuban, and Brazil. The granite used in the monument comes from Southern Africa and Canada. “It’s about the Old and New World stone coming together,” said Mr. Leon.

The spiral wall leads down to a map of the world centered on the coast of West Africa, with rays spiraling outwards to the United States, Brazil, Europe and the Caribbean islands.

One neat architectural trick: If you stand at the very center of the circular map, on the coast of West Africa, the acoustics of the memorial are such that your voice echoes back with a deep vibrato.
