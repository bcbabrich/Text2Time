It was Appreciation Night at the Edmonton Coliseum, all of it for goaltender Bill Ranford.

While Ranford made 39 saves tonight in the Oilers' 2-1 victory over the Devils, he was serenaded by a small but lively crowd of 9,791 chanting his name.

It was New Jersey's third loss in a row and first road defeat in three games away from home.

"We talked this morning about only allowing two goals on the road," Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur said. "We allowed only two, but we faced a guy who was outstanding in the net and he made the difference. He's one of the best in the world."

Ranford's heroics prompted the crowd to break into chants of "Billy! Billy! Billy!" as the Devils pressed for the tying goal in the final minutes of the third period.

"I can't remember it ever happening in this building," Ranford said after his 450th National Hockey League game. "It felt good to have the fans really enjoying the hockey game. We're trying to win these fans back, and I think we're putting a pretty good product on the ice and trying hard."
