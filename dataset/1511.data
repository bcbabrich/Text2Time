CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Anthony Kim was on his way up the leader board at the Quail Hollow Championship on Saturday when he took a detour on the 16th hole that led to what could turn out to be the most entertaining shot of the tournament.

Kim, the 2008 champion here, was seven under after a birdie at 15 when his tee shot at 16 sailed deep into the pine trees lining the right side of the fairway. Kim could have easily punched it out, which would have been the safe play. Instead, he tried to thread the ball through a forest of pines toward the green.

“On 7, I actually hit it through a tighter squeeze with a 3-wood and made a putt from off the green for birdie,” Kim said. “And so I figured I could do it again, and it just didn’t work.”

From golf ball to pinball, Kim’s shot bounced off several trees, sailed over a fan’s head and wound up even farther to the right as it landed just off the adjacent 18th fairway.

Kim did not have much choice from there. After waiting for Bo Van Pelt and Robert Allenby to make their tee shots at 18, Kim then sent a line drive 149 yards back down the 18th fairway in the opposite direction. The shot left him about 130 yards to the right of the 16th green. The only thing between Kim and the hole: a hill, more pine trees, hundreds of fans and a 25-foot-tall grandstand.

With only a glimpse of the top of the flag at 16, Kim lofted the ball over the stands and hoped for the best. Suddenly, he heard a roar from the crowd surrounding the 16th green and smiled brightly. The ball had found the center of the green, just under 20 feet from the flag. He barely missed the putt, but his double bogey drew huge cheers.

Kim, playing with a detached ligament in his left thumb that will require surgery, finished the round at two-under 70. For the tournament, he is five under par and in a tie for seventh, four strokes behind the leader Billy Mayfair.

He is right where he wants to be, even if he took a side trip to get there.

Asked what he needed to do on Sunday, Kim said, “Just hit a couple more fairways, and if I get the ball rolling early, I should have a good shot.”
