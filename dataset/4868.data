On March 31, before settling in for a game charades, Senator Edward M. Kennedy called an old friend, a Miami lawyer named Marvin Rosen, to wish him a happy Passover. The next day Mr. Kennedy called Mr. Rosen again, and not for holiday pleasantries. It was to find a defense lawyer for William K. Smith, his suddenly notorious nephew.

Thus began the deluge. The charge of rape against Mr. Smith has provided employment opportunities for, it seems, every trial lawyer from here to Lake Okeechobee and a few beyond. Nearly everybody connected to the case, however remotely, has hired representation.

Here is a scorecard, with absolutely no guarantee that it is complete:

Mr. Rosen recommended Mark Schnapp, his partner, who immediately went to work on Mr. Smith's defense with two Washington lawyers, Herbert Miller and Randall Turk.

Apparently unhappy with the Washingtonians, the Kennedys sought someone closer by. Joined by a lawyer for the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation, Brian Dunn, Mr. Smith met with Neal Sonnett and James Jay Hogan of Miami before hiring Roy Black, a dapper and down-to-earth man known locally as the Professor.
