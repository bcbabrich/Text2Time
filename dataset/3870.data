PRONUNCIATION of the name notwithstanding, what George Young most needs this season is for his rookie head coach to be facile while Dan Reeves, if not Bill Parcells, proves himself the fossil. Yesterday was a pretty good start, as Reeves lost his debut with Atlanta, while Jim Fassel had a bucket of Gatorade dumped on him, a game ball handed to him and ''Happy Birthday'' sung to him.

Fassel was 48 years young yesterday, but it was the Giants' general manager who had to be feeling spritely, as the Giants defeated Philadelphia, 31-17, at their home stadium, which by late last night had not yet been renamed for Parcells's Jets.

With Parcells reigning in Seattle, with the Giants beginning their lives as the unofficial Other Team in Town, it was almost imperative that the Young/Fassel era not begin like one of the many balls Dave Brown wobbled through the Meadowlands currents the last three years. The Giants flirted briefly with fourth-quarter disaster, but after the interception and 95-yard touchdown return by the rookie strong safety Sam Garnes, the first step in the emotional distancing from Reeves was taken.

''We want less historians and more pioneers around here,'' Fassel announced afterward, sounding the call for severance from the past.
