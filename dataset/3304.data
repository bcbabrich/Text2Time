''A brilliant thesis drawn from insight into the future,'' said the party's official paper, People's Daily, on May 22 in a typical description. ''A concentrated embodiment of the fundamental nature of the party and the essence of socialism.''

In other newspapers, officials have called Mr. Jiang's prosaic statement ''pregnant with connotations and meanings,'' ''a scientific summation of our party's nearly 80 years of historical importance'' and ''a great program for party-building in the new century.''

The Liberation Army Daily hailed it as ''an essential compass for military, ideological and political construction in the new era,'' while the Federation of Trade Unions, not to be outdone, said Mr. Jiang ''answers the question of why and how the working class is relied on the during the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.'' The China Women's News proclaimed, ''The 'Three Represents' are the criteria for women's work.''

The campaign is, of course, low-key compared with the vicious political winds of the Mao era, and much of the population today can simply tune it out. At the popular Xinhua Bookstore in central Beijing today, most customers walked right past the rack up front that featured the booklet on Mr. Jiang's speeches.

But the booklet is a best seller at the Party Documents Bookstore, where officials are buying it in bulk for their colleagues, and ambitious party and government leaders can hardly afford to ignore the new catch phrases.

''Quite apart from substance, the campaign is a test of whether subordinates and local leaders in the provinces are staying in step,'' the editor said. ''That's why in recent days we've seen one local leader after another coming forward -- it's a way to affirm their allegiance and keep their jobs.''

This new campaign went into overdrive even before last year's ''Three Stresses'' campaign (theoretical study, political awareness and good conduct) had fully run its course, causing complaints about the sheer waste of time and energy.
