He is considered an extremely capable and tough officer—“the best they have,” one American analyst said.

With his arrival at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, where the Communist delegations are quartered and working, the four chief delegates are now all present. The North Vietnamese leader Maj. Gen. Le Quang Hoa, arrived Monday.

Officials close to the military commission said that yesterday's session, which was attended only by the deputy heads of the delegations showed a marked improvement in atmosphere over the three previous days, when the Vietcong delegates had at first refused to present their credentials.

“I've been quite heartened by the progress,” one official said. The official, who said he could give no details of the meetings because of strict orders to keep the sessions secret, added that he expected the military commission might now be able to start sending out its seven regional inspection teams, “perhaps by early next week.”

The Paris agreement specified, that the seven regional teams were to be in place by last Tuesday.

It was also believed that the four heads of the delegations would hold their first formal meeting today. So far only their deputies have met.

The North Vietnamese and Vietcong delegates, who are living in a ramshackle compound of former United States Army barracks inside the air base, have been carefully guarded oy South Vietnamese military police and have had no contact with either ordinary. South Vietnamese or with the press.

Yesterday, however, according to a reliable United, States official, the North Vietnamese requested permission to visit a market off the base “to get some fresh fruit and vegetables.” The Communist reportedly said they were satisfied with the South Vietnamese military rations they have been fed, but would appreciate a change in diet.
