Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, locked in a tight race for re-election, may have just scored a few points with voters by ratcheting up the rivalry between his state’s Green Bay Packers and their arch rivals, the Minnesota Vikings.

After spotting a fan in a Packers shirt at an event in Schofield, Wisc., on Friday, Mr. Walker took a break from his standard stump speech to tell a story.

Mr. Walker said he was touring a steel plant in West Salem with Lieutenant Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and Representative Paul D. Ryan. Turns out, the plant was making the beams for the roof of the new Vikings stadium in Minneapolis.

“It’s being made by cheeseheads, how do ya like that?” Mr. Walker quipped, referring to the common cheese-wedge headgear of Packer fans.

“So me and Rebecca, we went up on that top beam and we wrote ‘Go Packers’ on it,” Mr. Walker said, to a chorus of laughter and brief applause.

And while the governor may have done it all in good fun — he says he teases former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota regularly about the Vikings’ lack of championships — sports teams don’t always take kindly to defacing a new stadium with a rival’s imprint.

The New York Yankees, for example, used a jackhammer to extract a David Ortiz jersey that a Red Sox fan had buried under two feet of concrete at the site of the new Yankee Stadium. Or the overheated reaction in Dallas to the Giants quarterback Eli Manning’s signature on the Cowboys’ locker-room wall after the Giants won the first game played in the new $1.2 billion stadium.

The Vikings stadium isn’t set to open until July 2016, so the Vikings still have time to find the graffiti and make sure it doesn’t get into the roofing, if they so choose.

But Mr. Walker didn’t stop at the beam boasting, getting in one more shot at the stadium, joking that they saved $1 million dollars because “they decided they didn’t need a trophy room.”
