CHICAGO, June 30 — Gov‐ ernor William W. Scranton said today that the Republican voters of Illinois supported his candidacy for the Presidential nomination even if their convention delegates did not. He expected, he said, that some of the delegates would recog‐

nize that fact by convention time. July 13.

The Pennsylvania Governor, at a news conference, said that the Nielson Poll, an established organization, had found that 65 per cent of the Illinois Republicans favored him, and that 35 per cent supported Sentor Barry Goldwater.

Mr. Scranton's news conference took place before the Illinois delegation announced that 48 of its 58 members had committed themselves to Mr. Goldwater, with none for Mr. Scranton.

The Governor, however, had been prepared for the blow. He was asked whether he would be surprised, or shocked, if the delegation indicated 48 or more for his rival.
