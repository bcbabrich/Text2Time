"But he told me that I wasn't next to be traded," Franco said yesterday afternoon, "and that he wanted me around. I told him I hoped to pitch four or five more years, and then go into coaching or managing. He said this would be a good opportunity to show my leadership skills and that he looked to me to provide veteran leadership to the younger players."

Franco took this seriously and counseled Jason Isringhausen, for one, who seemed slightly shaken by a loss to Colorado.

"It's not your first bad game," Franco told him, "and it won't be your last." And to Isringhausen and the other young Mets pitchers, he pointed out how baseball's best pitching staff, that of the Atlanta Braves, "took their lumps when they were younger. Glavine, Smoltz, Avery, they all had it tough. But they're making $4 million and $5 million now." It may seem like obvious advice, but having it come from a veteran could make a difference in a young player's psyche.

And Franco talked to some of the younger pitchers about why the Braves have such a terrific pitching staff. "For one thing," he said, "they are very good on fundamentals, from fielding to bunting, so they help themselves in a game. But they also work hard to stay in shape, and doing all the running and throwing between pitching assignments to keep them sharp."

Franco recalled this amid the uproar of bowling pins being attacked by major league ballplayers at the Bobby Bonilla/Budweiser All-Star Bowling Classic at the Leisure Time Bowling Center at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The purpose was to raise money for the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund. Besides Franco, the other bowling ballplayers included Cecil Fielder, Ken Griffey Jr., David Justice, Kenny Lofton, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, Mike Piazza, Kirby Puckett, Ozzie Smith and Frank Thomas.
