To the Editor:

Re ''A Global Warning to Mr. Bush'' (editorial, Feb. 26):

Not only does President Bush not seem to be interested or even aware of the real possibility of international calamities arising from global warming, he also seems inclined to foreclose on learning more about this phenomenon by cutting back on scientific research.

In the midst of talk about trillions of dollars of surpluses, a minuscule increase -- in effect a decrease -- in financing for the National Science Foundation, one of the major sources of research on global climate change, is tantamount to hiding one's head in the sand.

Stifling research on global warming will not make the phenomenon go away; it will just enable us to prolong our ignorance about it.
