There were political neophytes and students of foreign policy, onetime Republicans and lifelong Democrats.

There were bankers and lawyers, and probably a few sons of bankers and sons of lawyers, too. The only thing missing were the Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.

Welcome to Obama Singles Night in East Midtown, where a beer was $8 and a mixed drink $12.

Barack Obama probably wasn’t thinking of this crowd at The Grand on East 58th Street — a gathering of several hundred young professionals who are supporting him — when he made a pitch during Thursday night’s debate for health care that would give poor families more options than the emergency room. But they ate it up anyway.

They also went nuts every time CNN zoomed in on one of the many celebrities in the audience like Stevie Wonder or Pierce Brosnan. But mostly they were cheering for Mr. Obama.

If nothing else, the crowd on Thursday night at The Grand, on 58th Street on Manhattan’s East Side, was diverse — socially, ethnically, politically and professionally. And while Mr. Obama was their man, they clearly had wrestled with the decision.

“He was like my favorite college professor, and she was like my dominating mother,” said Clair Kenny, a 24-year-old city employee, who added that it was not an easy choice deciding to support Mr. Obama over Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. “I think as a woman, you don’t see many feminine role models as inspirational as Hillary. And that’s tempting. But Obama is closer to what I believe in, and that transcends gender.”

Said Jacob Buchdahl, 35, a lawyer, who was undecided until September: “Look, Hillary is brilliant and accomplished and highly knowledgeable about the issues. But as far as who inspires you as a leader, I don’t think it’s even close.”

Mr. Buchdahl said he was torn partly because the first vote he cast was for Bill Clinton. But in the end, he said, Mr. Obama reminded him more of Mr. Clinton’s spark and enthusiasm than Mrs. Clinton did.

Some were not even sure they were voting for Mr. Obama.

“Barack seems to be kind of trendy right now, so that’s what attracted me,” said Valerie Thertus, 22, a medical student whose intense academic schedule has left her with little time to read up on presidential politics. Thursday was one of here rare nights out.

“It’s Barack-mania right now,” she said, “and I just wanted to know more about what’s going on.”

And not everyone could even vote. “I’m Canadian,” responded James Nidd, 30, a banker, when asked which candidate he was supporting.

In theory, he said, he would vote for Mr. Obama. So why bother to come if you can’t vote? “The outcome of this election,” Mr. Nidd said, “affects the entire world.”
