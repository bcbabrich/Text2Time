Industrial production was unchanged in June from July as declines in output of semiconductors and cars offset increases in production of steel and paper. Still, the government said it expected factory output to rebound in the months ahead, forecasting that production would increase 1.5 percent in August and 0.6 percent in September. July's production figure is the latest of a string of data that points to a slowing of Japan's recovery. Last week, the government reported that the unemployment rate rose for the first time this year, increasing to 4.9 percent in July from 4.6 percent in June. Todd Zaun (NYT)
