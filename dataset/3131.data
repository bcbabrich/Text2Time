HOW did that alligator (spectacled caiman, to be exact) wind up in Central Park? Perhaps officials should question my mother.

When my dad was courting her, back when people still said ''courting,'' he spent a summer teaching in Florida. That was also back when you could mail baby Florida alligators North as scaly souvenirs. (Sometimes they were actually caimans.) And so, in lieu of flowers, he sent one to my mom.

A teddy bear, sure. Live lobsters, yum. But an alligator? Surely Dad knew that his intended was, like him, an animal person but with a much less sturdy constitution. How could he have reasoned that his cold-blooded missive would give her the warm fuzzies?

I imagine that when my mother laid eyes on the package, marked ''Live Reptile: Handle With Care,'' she felt two impulses: (1) nurse the helpless creature back to health after its cruel journey and (2) scream for someone to step on it. And shortly thereafter, I think, would come impulse (3): (a) nurse the helpless creature back to health and (b) feed my father to it.
