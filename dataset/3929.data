Re "She Suffered in Plain Sight But Alarms Were Ignored" (front page, Dec. 24), on New York City's inability to protect Elisa Izquierdo:

I am a guardian ad litem in Florida. Guardians are volunteers trained to investigate the home situations of children involved in custody cases. We assist the courts and overworked social workers. I have handled many cases. One involved an 8-year-old girl who had been abused. Her mother was a crackhead who left her daughter with her boyfriend in a rundown motel.

A couple across the street in a good home befriended the child. The boyfriend asked the couple if they would take her. They agreed and sought the Family Court judge's approval. The Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services recommended that she be sent to a foster home because this couple were not registered as foster parents.

I gave the judge a full report, recommending that the girl remain with this couple. He agreed. This case ended happily with the couple adopting the child.

Most states have guardian ad litems. Despite an overwhelming need, New York does not have such a program. If Elisa Izquierdo had had a guardian ad litem, she might be with us today.
