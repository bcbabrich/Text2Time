Ms. Goldstein said she expects to serve more vegetable main courses. Mr. Kunz also hopes to sell more tasting menus, not in response to any pleas for lightness from his customers, but as a showcase for his style.

A close relationship with regional growers is integral to the insistence on flavor; great flavor is impossible without superb, fresh ingredients. Alain Ducasse, the renowned French chef from Monte Carlo, has told students at the Culinary Institute of America that 60 percent of the quality of the dish depends on the ingredients. To that end, chefs around the United States have resolved to work more closely with farmers.

Starr Boggs, the owner of Starr Boggs in Westhampton Beach, L.I., is lucky enough to have a restaurant surrounded by farmers and fishermen. Other chefs have to reach farther afield. "I'm tired of having everything flown in and there's no reason why some of the items can't be grown here," said Mr. Gross, who is searching for farmers around Phoenix.

Mr. Bouley, who has cultivated a long list of farmers in the New York region, said, "I want to spend as much time as possible with farmers, and I intend to look for growers in Virginia and the Carolinas who can enrich the winter season with quality produce."

Such alliances, Mr. Kunz suggested, will trickle down into the consumer produce markets. "There are a number of wonderful products that we use that consumers can't find, like fresh pea shoots in the spring that you can cook like spinach but have the flavor of sweet young peas," he said.

Tight money notwithstanding, a number of new restaurants are in the works. In a few months, David Burke, late of the River Cafe in Brooklyn, will be at the stove at a new restaurant on Park Avenue and 63d Street. Red Sage, the lavish new Southwestern restaurant that Mark Miller of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., is opening in Washington, will be ready in February. Eberhard Mueller, the former executive chef of Le Bernardin, expects to open Opus, a fish restaurant, in Santa Monica, Calif., in March. Alberta Wright, who owns Jezebel, which serves Southern food in Manhattan's theater district, will be heading west. She's working on a new restaurant on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood, Calif.

"I think business will be good," she said. "I think there's a need for a restaurant like Jezebel in Los Angeles." She predicted that it would do better than the Paris version of Jezebel, which closed several months ago.
