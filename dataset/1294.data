WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — Man, I bounced all over the place on this one, but it was totally worth it. Normally, I’ll solve within a sector until it’s filled, but I kept getting stuck and seeking out familiar territory until I could get a firm toehold somewhere, anywhere. A person could work up a real hunger on a puzzle like this, but thankfully, David Poole has provided us with a snack at 31 Across. Not only that, but there’s enough wonderful wordplay here to make this a satisfying solve.

This is my kind of theme. There’s an odd-man-out at 25 Across in that the pun comes at the end of the line as opposed to the other theme entries, but in my opinion, the humor of the theme far outweighs such picayune matters. ICY DEAD PEOPLE may seem morbid to some, but I think it’s brilliantly funny here. So is A FARE TO REMEMBER, which I would definitely do if I got into a cab that Travis Bickle was driving.

Hey, PARSE is in the grid! We’ve used it enough here, so that should be a gimme. Also in the grammar department is a fabulous clue, “Short stop?” The question mark lets us know that we’re not talking sports here.

Fancy a Sports Illustrated model in a bikini at 29 Down? Sorry, we’re talking land masses here. I’ve “Worked at home”, but I haven’t UMPED, unless you count settling disputes between my kids.

Does the clue for 23 Down seem tough for a Wednesday? Don’t overthink this one, or go to Google it. It’s a lot easier than it seems.

The only quibble I have with Mr. Poole is at 28 Down. He seems to believe that OVA “travel down fallopian tubes”, which is technically correct, but “travel” makes it sound like they are floating leisurely down the Lazy River in a fallopian water park. Those of us with a pair of X chromosomes might question that. I won’t go into any more detail because it makes my editors crazy, but let’s just say that as far as I’m concerned, that is the main reason why they make ibuprofen.

It wasn’t exactly Masterpiece Theatre, but one of my favorite television shows of the 1970s was about a group of odd people “living on the air in Cincinnati”:
