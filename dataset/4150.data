Brian Buchanan, the Yankees' No. 1 draft pick in 1994, tore two ligaments in his left ankle while playing for the Class A Greensboro (N.C.) Bats Saturday night, and the club physician, Dr. Dan Murphy, said he would be sidelined for the rest of the season.

Buchanan, 22, considered the premier power hitter in the '94 draft, was hurt when he hit the first-base bag while running out a ground ball.

The team trainer, Chris Delucia, told The Greensboro News & Record that Buchanan had initially lost blood flow in the severely twisted ankle and that there had been fears for the foot until it was repositioned at a Greensboro hospital.
