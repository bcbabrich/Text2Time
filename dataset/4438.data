A submerged object in the Southern Ocean punctured the hull of the yacht Enza New Zealand yesterday during its attempt to sail around the world in 80 days. The impact, which has forced the crew to head for the nearest port, has eliminated any chance for the seven-man team to claim the Jules Verne Trophy and the accompanying $1 million in prize money.

The 85-foot catamaran was about 1,400 miles southeast of the tip of Africa when the accident occurred. Enza's co-skippers, Peter Blake of New Zealand and Robin Knox-Johnston of England, reported by radio that none of their crew was hurt, but that the boat was damaged too severely to continue.

Another catamaran trying to win the Jules Verne Trophy, the 85-foot Commodore Explorer, was about 200 miles ahead of Enza yesterday, and was continuing.

Enza New Zealand had traveled more than 9,000 miles and had averaged 14.5 knots, since leaving Brest, France, on Jan. 31. The boat was 4.3 days ahead of schedule in its 80-day global attempt. The record time for a round-the-world voyage is 109 days.
