Mr. Ho takes the wrapper in one hand and, with a table knife, scoops up shrimp filling to place on the wrapper, while pleating the back of the dough. Others are making shu mai, another dumpling that is made plain or topped with half a quail egg. As they work, the staff members chat in Cantonese. In the background, a radio broadcasts a Cantonese-dialect program. ''It's a Chinese love story,'' a woman says.

At 10:20 A.M., lunch is served in the entryway overlooking 14th Street (breakfast, often fried rice or rice noodles, is at 7). The meal has two delicious entrees: Chinese hairy melon, beef balls, and Chinese mushrooms poached in broth, and a spicy dish of tender beef sauteed with a Sichuan mustard green whose thick, knobby stem is preserved with salt and minced hot chili pepper.

At 11:30, the Rheon encrusting machine, a Japanese invention, is turned on so that the roast pork buns can be made - 30 a minute. One cook puts 25 pounds of fully risen dough into a large professional mixer for a minute and, scooping it up, runs across the room and feeds it into one side of the machine. In another opening, he adds the roast pork filling.

For a moment, nothing seems to happen. ''Wait,'' the cook says. In silence, deep within the machine, dough is being pushed around a hollow corkscrew, being shaped into a tube, while inside the hollow, filling is being pushed down. Both dough and filling are extruded simultaneously and dropped through two revolving disks that mold and cut perfect spheres. The stuffed buns are allowed to rise for 45 minutes and then are steamed, cooled and, the next day, packed and frozen. H.S.F. produces more than 2,000 buns a day.

As the buns drop gently onto a conveyor belt, Mr. Ho is in the kitchen inventing a new dim sum variation. At the moment, more than 100 are available at the H.S.F. restaurants. The standard menu pictures 48 dim sum, although visitors find two or three new items. EATING YOUR FILL, 7 DAYS A WEEK THESE are some of the restaurants offering dozens of varieties of dim sum seven days a week, in addition to their regular menus. The dim sum is usually served from morning through afternoon, although H.S.F. and Shun Lee Cafe serve theirs through the evening.
