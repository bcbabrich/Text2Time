They asked for policy details and all results since the N.F.L. began testing for steroids. The league began testing for steroids in 1987 and started random, year-round drug testing in 1990. The committee is not asking for the identities of individual players -- 44 are known to have been suspended for testing positive -- but it is asking for the number of players tested and the number of positive tests for each drug.

Tagliabue promised full cooperation. The N.F.L. has one of the toughest steroids policies in professional sports and recently announced it wanted to toughen its program to Olympic standards.

The letter to the N.F.L. was the first in a series of letters that will be sent to the other sports organizations as early as Monday, Robert White, a spokesman for the committee, wrote in an e-mail message yesterday.

Davis and Waxman also wrote in the letter to Tagliabue that the committee would hold additional hearings at an unspecified time. They had previously said they would consider additional hearings after the March 17 hearing, at which the retired slugger Mark McGwire refused to answer questions about whether he had used steroids and members of Congress criticized baseball's new steroids policy.

"As the committee has stated publicly numerous times, its focus on the issue of performance-enhancing drug use in sports is not limited to professional baseball," Davis and Waxman wrote to Tagliabue. "The hearing was the first in a series for the committee as part of its ongoing investigation into steroid policies for professional and amateur sports."
