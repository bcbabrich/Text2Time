"I would take anything." he said. "People should take a chance on somebody like me.

"Now that I got a daughter I would work real hard," he said, sounding like the people on confessional television shows, which does not mean he did not mean what he said. "I want to finish high school at night and get a real diploma, not an equivalency," he said. "I want to marry Jaylene and live with her and the baby. I could do messenger work, deliveries, sales, you know, anything."

UNTIL he got thrown out of school, he had more or less attended Beach Channel High School in the Rockaways, traveling an hour and a half each way. "I went there because they had a course in oceanography. I liked that."

On 34th Street, he said, "the Blass Employment Agency is around here someplace. It sends people to work a couple of days at a time. I'll go there." The new father stopped a few workers pushing carts to ask if they knew about it. He spoke in English and Spanish. No luck.

"Maybe there's a Gap around here someplace and I could get another application." He pointed to a building and said: "That's were I did deliveries until June 16. I kind of miss the place now. I was getting $4.63 an hour. When they hired me they said that after four months, I'd get $5 an hour, which is what they had paid the guy before me. When they didn't do it, I told them they were taking advantage of me and I quit. Later that day, my daughter was born."

HE walked back and fourth between Seventh and Ninth Avenues through several side streets, occasionally entering companies, mostly button distributors, to ask if they needed help. No one did. Then early in the afternoon, with some timidity, he approached a guard at Macy's and was given a pass to the personnel department. Along with a dozen others he sat in a waiting room and filled out his application, weighing every word of his answers. He had trouble with the boxes for his Social Security number because he had not brought his card and could not remember his number.
