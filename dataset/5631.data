Amid rumors that Michael Spinks, the International Boxing Federation heavyweight champion, and Butch Lewis, his promoter, intend to announce at a news conference today that they are withdrawing from the Home Box Office heavyweight-unification series, Rock Newman, a spokesman for Lewis, would say only that, ''Butch is going to make a statement to clear up rumors and misconceptions.''

According to the rumors, Lewis's withdrawal of Spinks would be in protest of the policies of the World Boxing Association in recognizing fighters from South Africa.

With Spinks out of the HBO series, Lewis would probably have an easier time making a lucrative match for Spinks against Gerry Cooney. In the past, Dennis Rappaport, Cooney's co-manager, has indicated he would not guarantee that Cooney would stay in the HBO series because it would limit future purses.

Yesterday, Rappaport said that he had made a congratulatory call to Lewis after Spinks beat Steffen Tangstad on Sept. 6, but that he and Lewis had not spoken since then. ''I'm as surprised as anyone else by the rumors,'' said Rappaport. ''And every time I tell people I haven't been talking with Butch, they say, 'Then why would he withdraw if there's no Gerry Cooney fight locked up?' ''
