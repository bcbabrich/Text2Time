Multinational Vault

He is perhaps best known these days as the bronzed man in the white underpants on a giant Calvin Klein billboard overlooking Times Square, but back in 1980 Tom Hintnaus was the nation's top-ranked pole-vaulter, a then 22- year-old Californian who cleared 18 feet 4 1/2 inches to win the Olympic trials and assure himself of the No. 1 pole-vaulting position on the United States Olympic team.

The boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow kept Hintnaus and other American athletes from fulfilling their dreams of competing. But for Hintnaus, the boycott posed a special problem.

Hintnaus, the son of Czechoslovak refugees who spent several years in Brazil before coming to the United States, had been born in Brazil. As the result of his dual citizenship, he had the right to go to the Moscow Olympics as a member of the Brazilian team.

But Hintnaus, who had left Brazil when he was 2 years old, put patriotism above vaulting. And while some American athletes with dual citizenships did elect to go to Moscow as a members of their native teams, Hintnaus did not.
