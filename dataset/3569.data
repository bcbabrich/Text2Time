To the Editor:

Since I rarely agree with William Safire, allow me to commend him for his realization that our consumer society has indeed turned in on itself (column, Nov. 29). As a 30-something veteran of the suburban mall culture, I too feel the emptiness around me and recoil from the glazed countenances of my neighbors as they pursue ever more elusive ''bargains'' at the expense of an inner life.

Parents generally lament the difficulties of raising children in this hyped environment as well as the lack of time available for family life. Would that we all spent fewer hours shopping and watching television and devoted more time to our family and friends. Consumers, heal thyselves!
