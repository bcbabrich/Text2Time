Re ''Schools Teach 3 C's: Candy, Cookies and Chips'' (Sept. 24): While it is critical that schools curtail or end their ties to companies selling low-nutrition foods, it is the responsibility of parents to teach their children the fourth C: choice.

Parents need to offer their children an array of nutritious foods including whole grains, fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and keep to a minimum cookies, candy and sugary soda.

But ultimately, they must allow children to choose what they consume. Furthermore, as children grow, parents need to be aware of their own eating habits and model healthy behaviors they would like to see in their children.

Parents can also involve children in food shopping and meal preparation, and teach them to make healthy choices. By doing so, they may raise a more nutrition savvy generation and help prevent obesity and diseases like diabetes.
