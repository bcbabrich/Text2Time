THIS fall's jug of fresh apple cider will look different from the cider jugs of previous years. It will wear a label that warns of the hazards of drinking juice that has not been pasteurized or otherwise treated to destroy potentially harmful bacteria.

This new warning label, which is expected to be announced by the Food and Drug Administration this month, will apply to all fresh fruit and vegetable juices, not just apple cider, whether they are farm-made or from a large manufacturer. Such labeling may help worried parents, like the woman who asked me last week whether it was safe for her daughter to drink fresh chilled raspberry juice.

''Is it pasteurized or not?'' she asked. ''It doesn't say anything on the label.''

Currently, there is no way to know whether juices in a refrigerator case have been pasteurized, if the label does not say so. It is, however, safe to assume that packaged or canned juice not held under refrigeration has been pasteurized.

Most juice sold in the United States is pasteurized; only about 2 percent is not. There are no figures on how many people are sickened by tainted juice each year, but a number of cases have gained national attention.
