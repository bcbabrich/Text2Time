''Mr. Schroder said they will have a special board meeting next week, when they will discuss the problems of the Bondi painting,'' he said. ''He said he thought the case should be investigated thoroughly, but at the same time he said that the Austrian Gallery's records showed there was nothing wrong.'' The conversation took place before Mr. Korte was aware of the Reif claim.

And late yesterday, Mr. Schroder also telephoned Constance Lowenthal, the director of the Commission for Art Recovery of the World Jewish Congress, the panel of which Mr. Lauder is chairman. The commission might get involved, she said, although it does not go into business until mid-January, and Mr. Schroder has asked Ms. Lowenthal to support the Leopold Foundation's effort in finding out the truth about the Bondi painting's ownership.

''These cases have moved to the top of our priority lists,'' Ms. Lowenthal said.

She said that she had not yet seen any paperwork on the Reifs' claim, but was reviewing the Bondi family's documentation ''with a view to determining our course of action, and it is voluminous and complex.'' Mr. Lauder, she said, declined to comment until the commission had taken a position on the cases.

Of the two cases, Mrs. Bondi's has the more thorough documentation. After the war, she tried many times from her home in London to reclaim ''Wally.'' Although she never filed a lawsuit seeking its return, she wrote many letters to lawyers in Vienna, and she sought help from Otto Kallir, a Viennese dealer who also fled the Nazis and who owned the Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan. Dr. Kallir, who compiled catalogues raisonnes of Schiele's works in 1930 and 1966, offered to serve as a witness to her ownership of the painting, letters from the 1960's show.

Mrs. Bondi also asked for help in retrieving ''Wally'' from Dr. Leopold, who had come to London in search of works by Schiele, Gustav Klimt and other artists. In return, she promised to help find drawings and other works by Schiele for him in London, where she owned St. George's Gallery. Dr. Leopold ignored her pleas for the return of ''Wally.''

''The problem was, she trusted Leopold,'' said Ruth Rozanek, a niece of Mrs. Bondi who lives in Bellevue, Wash. ''There were financial constrictions that didn't allow her to sue. But she should have sued.''
