Orlando Pizzolato has become a minor celebrity, the kind only a few people recognize.

He arrived in New York Sunday for a week of promotional work for the Oct. 27 New York City Marathon, which he won last year. Sunday night, he ran in Central Park, and if anyone's head turned when he passed, he didn't notice it.

''Nobody knows who I am,'' he said yesterday. ''Nobody knows my face here. In Italy, my name is famous. I like it when people come up to me and talk and take pictures and ask for my autograph. It hasn't happened enough to me not to like it.''

It almost happened last week in Italy, where Pizzolato ran in a series of races much like cycling's Tour de France. Everyone seemed to want to take his picture or get his autograph or have coffee with him. He wanted to run and train. He compromised - many pictures, too much coffee and enough running to fill his needs.

This will be his fourth New York City Marathon. In 1982 and 1983, his trips were financed by Champion, the sportswear company that sponsors his club team. In 1982, he dropped out after 15 miles, his legs as limp as spaghetti because this was his third marathon in five weeks. In 1983, he finished 27th, high enough for the marathon sponsors to pay his expenses to the 1984 race.
