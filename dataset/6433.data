WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 (UPI) — The Administration today dropped its appeal of a Federal Court ruling last year that struck down a law barring Federal employment of a per son who asserted the right to strike against the Government.

The Supreme Court agreed April 27 to rule on the consti tutionality of the law, which a special three‐judge court here struck down in November as an abridgment of free speech.

The decision came in a case brought by the National As sociation of Letter Carriers against Postmaster General Winton M. Blount several months before the postal work ers’ strike last March.

No explanation was given for abandoning the appeal be yond a brief statement from Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold and John W. Karr, ttorney for the union, that both parties had agreed that the ap peal should be dismissed. The Post Office had no comment.
