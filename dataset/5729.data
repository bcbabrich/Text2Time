If the United States Football League were to fold tomorrow, how many of its home-grown players -that is, those who haven't previously performed in the National Football League - would be sure-fire standouts in the N.F.L.? About 15, according to The Sporting News, which interviewed a number of anonymous N.F.L. general managers, scouts and personnel specialists to come up with this list of the blue-chippers:

Jim Kelly, qb, Houston (N.F.L. rights held by Buffalo); Herschel Walker, rb, Generals (Dallas); Trumaine Johnson, wr, sitting out season in contract dispute with Arizona (San Diego); Kelvin Bryant, rb, Baltimore (Washington); Gary Anderson, rb, Tampa Bay (San Diego); Steve Young, qb, Los Angeles (Tampa Bay); Gary Zimmerman, ot, Los Angeles (Giants); Irv Eatman, ot, Baltimore (Kansas City); Mike Rozier, rb, Jacksonville (Houston); Reggie White, de, Memphis (Philadelphia); Anthony Carter, wr, Oakland (Miami); David Greenwood, db, Oakland (New Orleans); Keith Millard, de, Jacksonville (Minnesota); Tim Spencer, rb, Memphis (San Diego), and Bobby Hebert, qb, Oakland (free agent in N.F.L.).
