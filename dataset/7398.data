ATLANTA, Jan. 31 (UPI) —A municipal judge today disissed as totally unfounded charges that Negro trusties had molested female civil rights workers jailed in a wave of protest demonstrations.

Demonstrators said earlier testimony they had to build a barricade of steel cots in the Atlanta jail to protect the women and girls from advances of the trusties. Several women said they were fondled by the trusties.

After a hearing, Judge T. C. Little said: “I dismiss the charges against these defendants as being totally unfounded. No one could identify anyone that placed their hands on them after swearing yesterday that they could.”
