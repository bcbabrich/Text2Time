Two Democrats, City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler and Douglas E. Schoen, the pollster, filed independent nominating petitions at the Board of Elections yesterday for the March 1 special election for the House of Representatives in the Seventh District in Queens.

The election was called because of the death last month of Representative Benjamin S. Rosenthal.

Mr. Leffler said he had filed about 6,700 signatures and Mr. Schoen, 9,561, to compete against the Democratic-Liberal candidate, State Senator Gary L. Ackerman, and the Republican-Conservative candidate, Albert Lemishow, a businessman.

Alan Gershuny, campaign manager for Mr. Ackerman, said it was ''quite unlikely'' that the Queens Democratic organization would challenge the validity of the independent petitions.
