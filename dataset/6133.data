ALBANY, Dec. 2—The burning of two ranger cabins in the Adirondack Moun tains by the State Department of Environmental Conservation as part of policy to eliminate man‐made objects from the wilderness has touched off furor among local residents.

One called it “one of the most desgraceful acts of arson that has ever occurred within our wild forest country.”

The destruction of the two cabins, to be followed by the burning of more by the end of the year, is in keeping with the state's Land Use Master Plan to restore wilderness areas to what they were before man first set toot in them.

Implemention of the plan has already resulted in the removal of boat docks from some remote lakes, the closing of jeep and truck trails, the removal of leantos and the destruction of fire towers. Local residents contend that the cabins are important to the preservastion of, human life in the area.
