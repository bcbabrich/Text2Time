The most astonishing auction ever produced went like this, around the table: one diamond, three diamonds, five diamonds, six diamonds, seven diamonds, double, redouble and all pass. This occurred in a London club 70 years ago, and when the dummy appeared, light dawned. The players were using a new deck that had two diamond suits and no heart suit. Remarkably, the deal had not produced any duplicated spot cards to alert the players that something was wrong with the deck.

Another diamond-studded auction occurred on the diagramed deal from the Flight A Regional Swiss Teams in Smithtown, N.Y., in February. This time the deck was entirely correct. South was Arnold Rosner of Brooklyn, and he opened one diamond. Dorothy Tourance, also of Brooklyn, sitting West, bid two diamonds, which was the Michaels convention, promising at least 5-5 in the major suits.

North was Rosanne Schabinger of Mount Prospect, Ill., and she contributed a natural raise to three diamonds. This was the equivalent of a single raise, since a stronger hand with a diamond fit would have made a cue-bid in a major suit. Lillian Weissman of Long Beach, N.Y., was East, and having a promising hand in support of the majors she cue-bid four diamonds, asking her partner to select a suit. West would have had to guess which suit to try and would have been wise, as it happens, to choose spades. Four spades would make nine tricks, but four hearts could be held to eight with a spade ruff.

This did not happen because naturally South bid five diamonds, completing the cycle of diamond bids. This ended the auction, and West led the spade king. Dummy's ace won the trick, and a diamond was led. East won with the ace and returned a spade, which was ruffed.
