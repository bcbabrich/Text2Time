As I lay in savasana at Yoga High on the Lower East Side, intoxicated by the sound of a bluesy harmonica, it struck me that yoga and music belong together, like a popping fire on a snowy day.

Not everyone agrees. Musical taste is overwhelmingly subjective (a Boy George oldie during pigeon pose is not easily forgiven) and pacing is critical (a hip-hop warm-up is too fast, too soon). And there is nothing inherently wrong with silence — the music of choice for many traditionalists. It helps focus the breath and settle the mind, and some slower-moving forms of yoga, like Iyengar, demand it.

But in these particularly morose times, I can appreciate the yoga that stretches beyond discipline into playfulness. There is nothing like Bob Marley or Nina Simone to usher a sense of joy and awe into a class. Good music only deepens my connection to the practice in a way that unending cycles of Kirtan chants, predictable New Age music and conventional Indian tunes do not.

I’m not alone. More teachers today take their playlists very seriously, particularly those who teach vinyasa, a dancelike style of yoga that is perfectly suited to many different kinds of music. This, coupled with the ease of downloading from the Internet and arranging playlists, allows teachers to roam into more musically imaginative territory. Musicians and D.J.’s, also increasingly attuned to the yoga vibe, are crafting music with yoga in mind.

Mel Russo, a co-owner of Yoga High, spends hours shaping her playlists. It shows. During one recent class we rose to Warrior I to the dance vibe of “Gypsy Woman” by Crystal Waters and segued into “Here Comes the Sun” (the Nina Simone version remixed by Francois K.).

She ended another class with the M. Ward version of David Bowie’s “Let’s Dance,” and that gorgeous, slow, harmonica-infused song made my savasana all the more blissful. After class, those intrigued by the tune were sure to ask Ms. Russo who sang it. (She often posts her playlists on the studio’s Facebook page.)

“I have taken some classes with music and I wanted to …,” Ms. Russo says, pretending to slash her wrists. Ms. Russo, a phenomenal teacher who helps runs one of the friendliest studios in the city, said teachers have to be aware of the ebb and flow of a class. “I’ve become more obsessed,” she said. “And I’ve gotten a huge response. And the more people who respond to yoga, the better it is.”

“It takes time, and not everything works,” she added.

True enough. It is risky. Some music can turn people off or even drive them away altogether. Many teachers don’t have the touch or the skill to blend music with yoga. Brette Popper, who publishes the popular YogaCity Web site, still cringes at the thought of Bruce Springsteen rasping away in a class. “I don’t care for him in a yoga class,” she said.

She prefers practicing yoga without music. “With music you tend to lose yourself in the music itself as opposed to listening to your body and breath,” Ms. Popper said. “Music to me can get in the way of the practice.”

At an Equinox on the Upper East Side, Derek Beres brings his own brand of music to class. A yogi, D.J. and music writer, he has teamed with the producer Dave Schommer, known as “Duke Mushroom,” to create EarthRise SoundSystem. (Their full-length album is titled “The Yoga Sessions.”) The idea was to reinvent yoga music, which they do by drawing overwhelmingly on global rhythms that are heavy on percussion.

He also focuses on pacing. Well into Mr. Beres’s challenging class at Equinox, his playlist slid into a Middle Eastern tune, “Egypt by Air” (by Bombay Dub Orchestra). Then, as the class wound down, a recognizable voice chimed in: It was Marvin Gaye asking at just the right moment, “Is That Enough?” Mr. Beres occasionally walked to the sound system to adjust the volume, eager to get each track, and the mood, just right.

“I’ve taken the music very seriously,” said Mr. Beres, who was the D.J. at the holiday party at Laughing Lotus recently. In Mr. Beres’s playlists, which he creates every Sunday, he prefers midtempo drum music without a lot of vocals. Jazz also makes frequent appearances. “You are looking for a sense of trance and trying to give people that meditative sense,” he said.

That is also the case with Aarona Pichinson’s class at YogaWorks in SoHo. One evening, she used “Chocolate Elvis (Bullitnuts Version 1)” (by the electronic group Tosca) and “Circlesongs” (Bobby McFerrin) to encourage the yoginis in the room to push past a series of trying balancing poses. Ms. Pichinson often chooses music with Indian undertones, only edgier, more electronic and psychedelic sounding. Swing music also crops up. And rounding out the mix was a song from Ladysmith Black Mambazo, which, with its mad percussion, was the perfect antidote to both the atrocious weather outside and the waning energy inside.
