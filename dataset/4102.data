Newt Gingrich has a reputation for being able to admit mistakes and change course. To his friends, the wonder of his $4.5 million book deal was that it took him so long to renounce it; to his critics, the wonder was that his political instincts flagged so much that he agreed to the deal in the first place.

Just before Christmas, Mr. Gingrich, the next Speaker of the House, accepted the advance deal from HarperCollins for two nonfiction books. Democrats attacked it as a gross exploitation of his new office. Republicans froze. On Thursday, Senator Bob Dole, the new majority leader, warned publicly that the deal could derail the Republicans' launch in Congress.

On Friday, Mr. Gingrich backed off, saying he would forgo the $4.5 million, taking a $1 advance and keeping any royalties. He blamed the "bitter old order" for trying to bring him down. But in the end, he was pragmatic, saying, "As one older precinct committeeman in Lancaster, Pa., told Bob Walker last Tuesday, 'Tell our new speaker we all worked for this victory and he should not take advantage of our efforts.' " Mr. Gingrich concluded, "That committeeman was right." KATHARINE Q. SEELYE
