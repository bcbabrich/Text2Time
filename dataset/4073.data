Just as there is a thread that joins the new school designers in Paris, so there has blossomed a common spirit among the younger generation of designers in New York, which sets them apart from America's old guard.

Even if one did not know Cynthia Rowley, Susan Lazar, Jill Stuart or Donna Haag, one could likely correctly guess their age group: in their 30's. There is a giddy informality in their design that one would not expect to find in the work of, say, a Bill Blass, Donna Karan or Ralph Lauren who have come to stand for sober, immortal clothes.

For many younger designers now, clothes seem alive for the moment, vibrating with disposable chic. It is an air that both Ms. Lazar and Ms. Stuart expressed well for spring. Ms. Rowley, while inhabiting the same universe, was not as successful.

Her design locomotive was out of control with no clearly discernible direction evident amid her wide-legged trouser suits, long awning-stripe dresses, ruffled asymmetrical dresses and coat jackets over slim pants.
