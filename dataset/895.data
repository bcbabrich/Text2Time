Diageo and the family that manufactures Jose Cuervo tequila are in advanced talks to swap two of their best-known brands, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Saturday.

Under the proposed terms, Diageo would acquire full control of the fast-growing Don Julio tequila brand from Cuervo, as well as a cash payment.

In return, Cuervo would gain Diageo’s Bushmills brand of Irish whiskey.

A transaction may be announced as soon as next week, though talks between the two sides are continuing and may still fall apart, this person cautioned. Cuervo, which is owned by the Beckmann family that is descended from Jose Antonio de Cuervo, is currently raising financing to support the deal.

Should an agreement be reached, it would come nearly two years after Diageo abandoned its effort to buy Cuervo outright, part of the British drinks giant’s campaign to increase its presence in the tequila market. Since then, the beverage conglomerate — whose other offerings include Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Tanqueray — has made smaller tequila acquisitions, including the Peligroso and DeLeón brands.

But it will gain a major foothold by buying full control of Don Julio, a top-selling brand of tequila. Unlike Cuervo’s namesake spirit, Don Julio is regarded as a premium brand that commands higher prices and has benefited from a steady rise in sales in recent years. Diageo traces its history with the brand back to 1999 when its predecessor, the Seagram Company, invested in the company.

Diageo reported that its tequila sales rose 34 percent in its fiscal year ended June 30, largely on the strong performance of Don Julio.

Cuervo, meanwhile, will gain control of Bushmills, one of the biggest brands of Irish whiskey. Diageo reported that the spirit’s sales rose 7 percent in its fiscal year ended June 30.

Representatives for Diageo and Cuervo were not immediately available for comment.

News of the talks was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
