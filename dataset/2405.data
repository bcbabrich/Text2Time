For several years now, Thomas L. Friedman has balanced two major subjects: the Middle East and globalization. The Middle East, with the specter of civilizational clashes and apocalyptic terrorism, has been the bad news. Globalization, promising international prosperity and harmony, has been the good. Yet as Friedman shows in his new book, "The World Is Flat," this good news may not be all that good, at least for those who keep an eye on America's place in the world. Friedman presents a passel of statistics showing that we are falling badly behind in the crucial areas of science and technology.

There is probably no one more aware of these trends than Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International and author of the best-selling book "The Future of Freedom." In his review of Friedman's book (Page 10), Zakaria cites a passage in which Friedman stands outside an outsourcing company in Bangalore and watches "wave after wave" of young Indian techies passing by, all eager, all prepared to participate in the new global economy. Meanwhile, as Friedman tells us, America ranked third in the world in the number of science degrees awarded to 18-to-24-year-olds three decades ago. Today it ranks 17th.

On the back page, Randy Cohen, who writes the Ethicist column for The Times Magazine, makes an unusual appeal to readers: Cohen is putting together, with the help of the graphic artist Nigel Holmes, a literary map of Manhattan for the Book Review -- not of authors' homes and haunts, but those of their fictional characters: from the Plaza, where not only Eloise but Woody Allen's Emma Bovary lives (and Jay Gatsby visits), to St. George's Church in Stuyvesant Square, where Mary McCarthy's novel "The Group" begins. We're counting on readers to send in their own favorite New York literary citations. See the box on Page 31 for more information. The Editors
