JERUSALEM, Sept. 1â€”An Israeli Government minister has reportedly prepared a security plan for the occupied West Bank that would involve surrounding what are considered to be Arab trouble areas with new Jewish urban and rural settlements.

The plan, which apparently would require tens of thousands of new settlers, has not yet been submitted to Prime Minister Menahem Begin and his Government for approval. According to the newspaper Maariv, it was being completed by a planning team working under the supervision of Minister of Agriculture Ariel Sharon, who is chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Settlements.

The minister, a former general, acknowledged, when reached today in the Parliament cloakroom, that he had a plan but said that he had never discussed it publicly and refused to reveal details at this time.

However, the details as reported by Maariv were consistent with the platform of the Likud bloc, which heads the Israeli Government, and with statements on the West Bank made recently by Prime Minister Begin.
