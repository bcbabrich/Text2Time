Others are looking, in the meantime, for alternative means to brighten the picture. But, except for one outstanding exception, the plans seem to rest on gambles as chancy as the casino campaign.

The exception is the restoration of the beaches.

In the glory days of Miami Beach, which dwindled and then ended abruptly owing to a combination of events topped by the energy crisis of 1973‐74, the men who operated the seaside resorts along Hotel Row on Collins Avenue ran their empires with a keen sense of service, business and cirofitmaking.

They blocked measures to restore the narrow sandy beach that was eroded by natural ocean currents and the intrusion of concrete bulkheads and canopied hotel cabanas because they did not want the public to share widened beach with guests who were paying up to $100 a day.

Other Projects illusory

With economic reversals, however, the way was opened for the Federal Government to pump money and sand into Miami Beach: a $60 million dredging operation to restore 10 miles of oceanfront.

Other projects are more illusory than real at the moment. Local business leaders are seeking $100 million in loan guarantees from Federal agencies to refurbish the resort hotels. They contend that such an investment would benefit the entire area.

However, Paul Dempsey, an official with the Economic Development Administration in Washington, said in telephone interview that the Miami Beach proposal had significant “defects” and would require extensive rewriting before it could be given serious consideration..

“Our talks at this moment are very preliminary and only exploratory,” said Mt. Dempsey. “A lot of the problem is obvious: Some of the hotels have been skimming off profits and the deterioration has been allowed to happen.”
