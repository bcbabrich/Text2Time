Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees has drawn great attention this week for his activities on and off the field, and the fans at Fenway Park — informed, opinionated and sophisticated about baseball — are having a good time with him tonight as he faces their first-place team.

When Rodriguez batted for the first time in the second inning, more than a dozen customers in the box seats near the Yankees’ dugout wore yellow Halloween masks that showed the face of a woman with blond hair. They were a reference to reports and photographs that have placed Rodriguez on road trips with a female friend to whom he is not married.

In the Boston half of the second, when the inning ended on a pop-up to Rodriguez, who plays third base, thousands of fans yelled, “Mine! Mine!” as the ball came down. That was a reference to the accusation against Rodriguez by the Toronto Blue Jays that Rodriguez yelled the same thing to a Toronto infielder, Howie Clark, on Wednesday, while running the bases, causing Clark to back off from a pop-up and let it drop.

The Blue Jays accused Rodriguez of unprofessional conduct. After Rodriguez caught the ball tonight, he softly flipped it into the crowd for a souvenir, a rather common gesture of sportsmanship that many players perform. However, many fans urged the man who caught the ball to throw it back. So, he did, an unusual move more often performed only by fans in the outfield when an opponent hits a home run.

Fenway security guards approached the man who threw the ball back and spoke to him, but it did not appear that he was ejected.

When Rodriguez batted in the third inning, he hit a hard drive off the Green Monster in left field, which often results in hard and long caroms. When Rodriguez tried to reach second base for a double, he was thrown out by a wide margin — left fielder Manny Ramirez to second baseman Dustin Pedroia. The fans cheered loudly. Rodriguez, as he approached the dugout, inexplicably clapped his hands as if applauding himself.
