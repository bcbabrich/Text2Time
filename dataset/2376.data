The circumstances of the shooting remained unclear yesterday. There had not been any previous reports of abuse at the apartment, the police said, and there were no disciplinary problems evident in the officer's work history. Officer Mahon was last seen on Saturday, the police said. They said there was no suicide note.

The police discovered the officer and his girlfriend in their bedroom at 55-05 Woodside Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Both appeared to have died of gunshot wounds to the head, and a .38-caliber revolver lay beside Officer Mahon's body, the police said. It was unclear yesterday whether the gun was Officer Mahon's service revolver.

Officer Mahon taught special weapons courses at the Bronx outdoor range, and worked with recruits in the simulation portion of their training, when officers use role-playing and paintball guns to act out possible encounters the recruits could face on the street, said Inspector Steven J. Silks, commanding officer at the range.

"Super guy, step-up guy, always looking to take on more responsibility," the inspector said. "He was one of the go-to guys. The command is in shock. Besides being in shock and asking why, we're going to miss this guy. He is one of the people you look forward to seeing."

Inspector Silks said that counselors would be available to officers at the range.

Officer Mahon's mother lives upstairs in the building where the couple lived, and relatives arrived throughout the day yesterday to comfort her, declining to speak to reporters.
