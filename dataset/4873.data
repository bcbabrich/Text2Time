That display of harmony among political opponents who were trading recriminations only weeks ago was interrupted when a black nationalist faction, the Pan-Africanist Congress, walked out this afternoon. It wanted the convention held outside South Africa, but that and its other proposals were rejected.

Barney Desai, head of the Pan-Africanist delegation, said his group was suspending participation until it consulted its members, some of whom are upset about the willingness of some of its leaders to negotiate.

The Pan-Africanist Congress maintains that only Africans belong in South Africa. Guests From Abroad

Mr. Ramaphosa and Mr. Viljoen urged the few other parties that boycotted the preparatory talks to attend the December convention or find themselves marginalized politically. The right-wing Conservative Party, which wants to preserve apartheid, stayed away as did extremist groups like the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement.

The Azanian People's Organization, a black consciousness movement, also rejected the invitation, contending that participation was tantamount to collaboration with the Government.

Guests from the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth and foreign embassies here will be invited, and the sessions will be open to the press.

The December convention is expected to open with speeches by Mr. de Klerk, the African National Congress's leader, Nelson Mandela, and others, and then to form working groups that will focus on aspects of the negotiating process. The African National Congress and other opponents of the Pretoria Government's will press demands for an interim administration and the election of an assembly to draft the new constitution, both of which Mr. de Klerk opposes. Political Maneuvering

The realization that negotiations were at hand appeared to overcome ideological differences, accounting for the show of tolerance with which the meeting ended today.
