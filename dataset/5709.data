With increasing frequency, young adults in Manhattan are turning to singles programs set up by churches and synagogues for their social life, according to clergymen and social scientists.

''A new kind of immigrant has come to Manhattan - the single professional - and churches and synagogues are being forced to adapt,'' said the Rev. Kevin V. Madigan, a Roman Catholic priest who runs the Yorkville Outreach Program, a Catholic organization that serves single adults on the Upper East Side.

''Here you have people whose dream it was to come to New York, and who face crushing pressures at work,'' he said. ''They want a place to turn to meet people who have the same value systems.''

While at first they may attend for purely social reasons, single people are providing a new source of congregants for churches and synagogues whose memberships declined sharply in recent decades, the clergymen said.
