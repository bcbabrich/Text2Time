In the second-largest corporate takeover ever, the Walt Disney Company moved yesterday to create the world's most powerful media and entertainment company, announcing that it would acquire Capital Cities/ ABC Inc. for $19 billion.

The combined company would bring together the most profitable television network and its ESPN cable service with Disney's Hollywood film and television studios, the Disney Channel, its theme parks and its repository of well-known cartoon characters and the merchandise sales they generate.

"These are the two premier family entertainment companies," Michael D. Eisner, the chairman and chief executive of Disney, told a news conference in New York.

The deal, which had already been approved by the boards of both companies when it was announced yesterday morning, was a stunning surprise. In contrast to the much-discussed offer that the Westinghouse Electric Corporation is known to be preparing for CBS Inc., not a word had leaked out about a deal that would create the most powerful entertainment company in the world. Westinghouse is expected to announce its offer today. [ Page D5. ]
