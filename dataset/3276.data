Under a little-known financial agreement with the magazine industry, the Office of National Drug Control Policy has indirectly encouraged magazines to include antidrug messages in their editorial content.

An article in the online magazine Salon yesterday reported that six magazines -- U.S. News & World Report, The Sporting News, Family Circle, Seventeen, Parade and USA Weekend -- have benefited from a media campaign the drug policy office put in place during the last year, providing financial incentives to magazines for content that the office considers sympathetic to its antidrug message.

The arrangement partly mimics one that existed with the television industry. Until late January, White House drug policy officials were given advance viewings of more than 100 episodes on all the major TV networks. If the government approved a particular show that featured an antidrug message, the network programming it received credit that reduced the number of expensive public service announcements it was required by law to broadcast.

The White House was allowed to review some scripts and advance footage of television shows including ''E.R.,'' ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Cosby.'' After Salon reported the arrangement in January, the office said it would no longer collaborate with the networks in that manner.
