They also succeeded because they took the Knicks out of their two-man game of Ewing and Starks, and forced them to play fast-paced, run-the-court basketball. And New Jersey didn't let up after jumping to a 52-43 halftime lead. Only 3 Rebounds for Ewing

Ewing had 16 points and 3 rebounds, 7 points and 9 rebounds below his average. Starks, who had 13 points, 3 below his average, had three more rebounds than Ewing.

New Jersey (31-24) also played some of its best defense of the season. Only Ewing, Starks and Mason, who had 14 points, scored in double figures for the Knicks (36-18). Charles Oakley (6) and Charles Smith (7) were invisible, while Greg Anthony scored just 5 points and shot two fabulous airballs.

The Knicks, who were routed in Detroit on Friday, shot 35.9 percent from the field. The Nets, who had shot less than 40 percent during their three-game losing streak, shot 44.9 percent today.

"In the last few games, we haven't been playing well," said Ewing. "It's embarrassing. We have to keep playing hard and go back to the drawing board. We didn't execute, all of us. I didn't keep Chris Dudley off the boards."

Nets Coach Chuck Daly recently had a talk with Dudley and told him to be like another star he has coached: Dennis Rodman, king of the rebound. "He told me to go after the boards, go after it," said Dudley. No. 1 vs. No. 2

This game further sweetened the rivalry between the Knicks and the Nets -- who are in first and second place, respectively, in the Atlantic Division -- because it demonstrated that the Nets can win. The Knicks, who now lead by five and half games, had easily won the teams' first two meetings this season, with New York just brutalizing the Nets in the second one.
