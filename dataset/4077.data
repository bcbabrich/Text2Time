IT is not often that anyone puts his life in the hands of a total stranger who admits to being a smuggler, a heavy drinker and a daredevil willing to navigate a treacherous river on the blackest of nights to slip an illicit cargo past the police. But this may be necessary for anyone interested in a wild ride up the Daning River in the Three Gorges area of central China.

Lu Houbi, a man with a formidable stubble on his chin and who, like many peasants in Sichuan Province, smokes dried leaf tobacco in a copper pipe, has a way of admitting his shortcomings (that is not what he calls them) while at the same time exuding an unassailable confidence that he is a master of the roaring brown torrent that joins the Yangtze River at the port city of Wushan, or Witch Mountain.

''I have worked for 37 years on this river and I know every turn and every current,'' he said on a September day's exploration of the area. ''I know this river so well that once I even took a boat through here at 2 o'clock in the morning -- we were smuggling silk cocoons -- and never had a problem,'' he adds, not boasting, just putting his passengers at ease.

Dressed in patched trousers and faded army shoes, Mr. Lu may look a little like a river pirate, but to watch the 55-year-old boatman guide his well-worn wooden vessel against the deluge is to feel his instinctive connection with the environment he has inhabited all his life.
