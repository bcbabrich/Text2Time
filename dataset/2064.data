Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, the world champion, drew his last round game to sew up his eighth win at the prestigious Dortmund tournament. He finished a full point ahead of his closest pursuers. The official Web site of the tournament with the final standings can be seen here.

Finishing in second were Viswanathan Anand of India, the world’s top-ranked player, Peter Leko of Hungar, world No. 7, and Evgeny Alekseev, No. 24.

Kramnik was in control of the tournament from the start. He won three of the four games he played with White and lost none. He was never in any trouble in any of his games and his performance seemed almost effortless throughout. It was the kind of performance that should make his competitors worry as they approach the world championship tournament in Mexico City in September and October. Clearly, the world champion is on top of his game and he is playing as well as he ever has.

Overall, only 7 of the 28 games were decisive, although most were very competitive. It is probably a testament to how far theory has developed, especially defensive knowledge and practice, that players can push hard for wins but still not go over the precipice and lose. Is Bobby Fischer’s statement that chess is played out coming closer to fruition? Should there be more Fischer Random Chess tournaments (also known as Chess 960 after the number of different starting positions)? Or, is chess better now than ever — a bit closer to perfection, but as exciting, or more so, than in the past? Maybe the Association of Chess Professionals (whose home page is here) might want to canvass its members about this topic as it did earlier this year over whether draw offers should continue to be allowed. (The results of that survey can be seen here.)
