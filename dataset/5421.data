ROBERT CHESLEY'S two-character drama, ''Jerker, or the Helping Hand,'' is a cry of anguished solidarity from the heart of San Francisco's homosexual world, a segment of society where the AIDS epidemic has taken an especially devastating toll.

The play consists of 20 telephone calls between J.R. (Jay Corcoran) and Bert (John Finch), strangers whose anonymous telephone-sex relationship turns into a morale-boosting dialogue on homosexual pride. Conversations that begin as intricate, kinky safe-sex fantasies change in mood and quality as rough ''playtime'' stories metamorphose into tender ''bedtime'' stories that look back nostalgically to the 1970's.

''Jerker'' accurately bills itself as ''a pornographic elegy with redeeming social value,'' and its gamy language and simulated autoeroticism are definitely not for squeamish tastes. But they serve a poignant purpose by pointing out, more bluntly than any other play dealing with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, how the epidemic has threatened one of the fundamental reasons for an entire group's very existence - its freedom of erotic expression - and challenged its hard-won self-esteem. Over the course of the drama, we learn that J.R. is a paraplegic Vietnam veteran. And in a stridently angry and simplistic diatribe, he contrasts the evil morality of war to the ''really, truly basically good'' promiscuous way of life that the epidemic has cut short.

The play's staging underscores the protagonists' isolation, vulnerability and fear as the two men, each lying nude on a bed on opposite sides of the stage, connect by telephone and by Bert's telephone answering machine, which, toward the end of the drama, becomes a harbinger of doom.
