CREYS‐MALVILLE, France, July 31—A demonstrator was killed and at least 20 were injured in clashes with the police here today as 30,000 antinuclear protesters sought to invade the construction site of a fast‐breeder reactor.

The police said that five officers had been wounded, including one whose hand was blown off while he was attempting to throw a tear‐gas grenade.

According to the police, the demonstrator was killed when he was trampled by other protesters fleeing from tear gas.

The demonstrators—most of them French youths but also contingents of West Germans, Belgians, Swiss and Scandinavians—marched in three large columns toward the reactor site, which was heavily guarded by 5,000 riot policemen, spread out in five security rings around a 10‐square‐mile area.
