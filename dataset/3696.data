In a back-to-school gift to shoppers and retailers, the fourth tax-free shopping week in the last two years begins today in New York State, with state sales taxes eliminated on all clothing and shoes costing less than $500.

New York City has suspended its own tax as well, meaning that through next Monday, city shoppers will not have to pay the normal 8.25 percent in sales tax on most types of apparel. The reprieve is intended in part to keep shoppers from taking their business elsewhere, as lower-tax states like New Jersey have often drawn people at peak shopping times like the holidays and before the opening of school.

Some retailers are worried, however, that the recent turmoil on Wall Street and other factors may undermine the impact of this week's tax cut.

''During past tax-free shopping weeks, United Colors of Benetton stores citywide saw a dramatic surge in sales,'' said Carlo Tunioli, general manager of Benetton U.S.A. ''However, this tax-free shopping week may be impacted by the recent instability in the financial markets and the unrelenting hot weather, making customers reluctant to shop and thereby affecting a normally profitable sales period.''
