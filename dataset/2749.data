Jolted by tumbling stock prices and the economic fallout from the SARS virus, the Bank of Japan's monetary policy board said today that it would flood the markets with yet more cash and expand the range of collateral that it accepts for loans.

The moves are the latest in a series of incremental steps taken by the central bank's new governor, Toshihiko Fukui, who took office in mid-March. The measures are unlikely to provide any significant stimulus to the economy or relief to the nation's struggling banks, but Mr. Fukui is under pressure from the government to find ways to help halt the long slide in Japanese asset prices.

Unlike his predecessor, Masaru Hayami, who resisted direct pressure from the government, Mr. Fukui has agreed to cooperate with lawmakers as much as he can. To that end, the central bank said today that it would begin accepting bank loans that had been turned over to the government-backed Industrial Revitalization Corporation as collateral for new lending. The decision is meant to prod the country's banks to sell their troubled loans to this new organization.

More immediately, policy makers are fearful that further declines in the stock market will weaken Japan's banks, which count some of their immense shareholdings as capital. Typically, the central bank tries to avoid creating the appearance that it is reacting to short-term market moves. But in an unusually blunt statement, the bank's policy board said today, ''Careful attention is warranted so that the stock price developments will not negatively affect financial markets and economic activity.''
