It was mighty quiet at the Coffee Station on Wednesday.

Too quiet, especially for the townspeople and tourists who lined up along the walls inside what is Crawford's only diner for a glimpse of the town's most famous resident, who usually comes for a cheeseburger to ring out the old year.

This year, President Bush was a no-show.

Maybe it was Code Orange. Or maybe Mr. Bush, who has not been seen in public since he arrived here Friday and headed into his 1,600-acre ranch, did not want to answer questions about mad cows, his attorney general or his New Year's resolutions. Whatever the reason, a president who was remarkably chatty this time last year -- taking reporters on a brisk hike, and answering questions about North Korea and Saddam Hussein in the diner's parking lot -- was nowhere to be seen.

The disappointment was palpable inside the Coffee Station, which, like Iraq, is under new management since Mr. Bush's last New Year's visit. Doug Cheatham, a Texan who moved to Connecticut years ago, brought his wife, Zora, and other family members well before noon. They scanned the crowd, looking for tell-tale signs, including Secret Service agents. There were a few -- but they were coming for lunch, without their protectee.

Diners had to sign up for a table. Words rarely spoken inside -- ''Brown, table of two, we're ready for you'' -- were shouted above the din as scores hoped to score a table next to the president's.
