He began taking money from the campaign in August, after Suzanne DuBose, the executive director who co-signed all checks for more than $2,000, resigned, campaign aides say. Her replacement, Robin Bell, did not want responsibility for writing checks. Harold Ickes, counsel to the campaign committee, explained that Mr. Biegen was "the logical choice" to take on that task.

Even though Mr. Biegen was not supervised, there was little chance such money transfers could go undiscovered for long -- campaign contributions and expenditures had to be disclosed to the Campaign Finance Board by Jan. 15.

"Obviously, it was an act of desperation," said Basil A. Paterson, a labor lawyer and former deputy mayor under Edward I. Koch. Mr. Paterson is an adviser to Mr. Dinkins and a longtime friend of Mr. Biegen's. "It made me think of the Maxwell deal," he said, referring to the financial shell games of the British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. "Anyone looking at the books would see money had been transferred right away." Fast Friends

Mr. Paterson described Mr. Biegen as "very warm, very engaging, not somebody you only do business with -- you quickly get friendly." After Mr. Biegen became chairman of Mr. Dinkins's 1985 campaign for Manhattan borough president, the two men became fast friends -- spending weekends together in Mr. Biegen's five-bedroom summer house in East Hampton, L.I., and playing tennis. Mr. Dinkins attended the wedding of Mr. Biegen's eldest son in 1990.

Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that he could not recall exactly how he met Mr. Biegen, but he thought it was between 1983 and 1985. Mr. Dinkins, who asked Mr. Biegen to replace his campaign chairman, Howard Samuels, after Mr. Samuels died in 1984, explained that "Mr. Biegen had a good reputation, and assisted Mario Cuomo in raising funds."

Governor Cuomo did not return phone calls yesterday. His son Andrew Cuomo and Lucille Falcone, a longtime friend and fund-raiser, did not return repeated phone calls. But other friends of the Governor said that Mr. Biegen met Mr. Cuomo in the mid-70's, when the Governor was still a private citizen. In 1977, when Mr. Cuomo ran for Mayor of New York City, Mr. Biegen was a member of his finance committee. William J. Stern, a former fund-raiser for Mr. Cuomo, said of Mr. Biegen: "He was a loyal guy -- he did his job. He wasn't a star, but he wasn't a cluck, either." Prestigious Positions

Mr. Biegen did not appear to lavish his own money on his influential friends. When he and his wife had dinner at Nanni Al Valletto in Manhattan with Mr. Cuomo in 1981 during his campaign for Governor, it was the candidate who paid the $200 check. In his diary, Mr. Cuomo complained that the evening was "fun, but outrageously expensive."

Mr. Biegen lives in an apartment in large, brick building in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. His friends describe him as warm, engaging and honest. Some people close to the Mayor paint a less flattering portrait, but only on condition that they not be identified. Several aides complained that Mr. Biegen did not contribute much money of his own or raise impressive sums from his friends. Campaign finance records show that in 1989, he made no personal cash contributions to the Mayor.
