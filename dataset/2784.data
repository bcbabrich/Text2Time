Summer has barely begun, but already advertisers are thinking about buying commercial time during Super Bowl XXXVIII, to be broadcast on CBS on Feb. 1.

One advertiser buying time is a Super Bowl newcomer, the Procter & Gamble Company. Gretchen Mutchnick, a spokeswoman for Procter in Cincinnati, confirmed a report this week in Advertising Age that the company had agreed to be a sponsor.

''It's an opportunity to reach an important group of consumers in an emotional way,'' Ms. Mutchnick said, adding that Procter was ''working to determine what brand would be right'' for the time slot. Procter has advertised before and after Super Bowls but never during the game.

Advertising Age reported that CBS, part of Viacom, had already sold about a third of the total commercial time during the game, at an estimated average price of $2.4 million for each 30-second spot.
