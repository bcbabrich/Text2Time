Kindred on Saxophone Bob Kindred Quartet, at Red Blazer Too, 349 West 46th Street (262-3112). The spirit of the great tenor-saxophonist Ben Webster is kept alive in the playing of Bob Kindred, who frequently shows his deep admiration for Webster not by copying him but by building on the emotion and intelligence that Webster brought to his performances. Soul and swing are two dominant elements in Mr. Kindred's work, but there is also a strong overlay of simple basic fun. He has been playing on Sunday afternoons at the Red Blazer Too since last fall, using a small interchangeable company of associates. This Sunday, when the group plays from 1 to 5 P.M., Al Harewood will be the drummer, Ted Rosenthal will be the pianist, and John Goldsby will be on bass. There is no cover charge and no minimum. Brunches range from $9.95 to $13.95. Braff, Moore and Alden

Ruby Braff Trio, at Zinno, 126 West 13th Street (924-5182). Ruby Braff, the dauntless little cornetist, has such a confident personal style that he contributes an individual glow to any group he's in. With Michael Moore as his bassist, as frequently happens, they are an impeccable and responsive duo. But tomorrow evening the level of inventiveness and polish is moved up a notch as Howard Alden, the versatile guitarist, joins them in a trio that is a constant scene of musical challenges. The music starts at 8 P.M. There is a $10 minimum at the bar and a $15 minimum at tables, but there is no cover charge. Levinsky's Swing Band Walt Levinsky and His Great American Swing Band, at Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272). Walt Levinsky's panorama of Swing Era big bands draws on Gene Krupa, Harry James, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, the Dorsey Brothers and Benny Goodman in this second edition of its survey of swing at Michael's Pub. It is not just the spirit of these performances that makes them memorable but also the younger generation of musicians in Mr. Levinsky's band who have become new stars of the big band styles - Warren Vache on cornet, Randy Sandke on trumpet, Joel Helleny on trombone and Spanky Davis on trumpet, playing and singing with his own verve (and with Lynn Roberts) on the Roy Eldridge-Anita O'Day duet on ''Let Me Off Uptown.'' They are at the pub for only one more week (their sixth) after this weekend. They play tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11:30 for a $20 cover charge and a two-drink minimum.
