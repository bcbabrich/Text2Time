MOSCOW, Feb. 29—The Soviet Government newspaper said tonight that political jokes current in the Soviet Union were stimulating “unhealthy interest” in the political opponents of Premier Khrushchev who were ousted from the ruling group in 1957.

A reader's letter in the newspaper, Izvestia, urged a campaign against such “twaddle.” The reader broadened his complaint to take in all gibes that denigrated Soviet life.

He specified that the campaign he had in mind should stop short of the methods used by Stalin to suppress dissent.

The letter, covering half a page in the six‐page edition of Izvestia, was the latest indication of discontent sections of the populace. The discontent appears to be related to the economic setback suffered last year as a result of the failure of the wheat crop.
