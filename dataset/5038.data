To the Editor:

While it is heartwarming to read of the continued interest in the golden age of radio (About New York column, Nov. 14), it is like reading the obituary of one who is not dead.

Whenever I tell people that I produce radio drama, they invariably respond, "Oh, you mean like 'The Shadow'!" It is this image of radio theater frozen in time that is responsible for the stagnation of an incredibly rich art form in this country.

All across America, producers work at radio theater, not recreating the golden age, but rather bringing modern sensibilities and fresh imagination to a medium with almost limitless potential for communication. For the last 10 years, the Midwest Radio Theater Conference, held in Columbia, Mo., has attracted hundreds of young writers, actors and producers, fascinated by the chance to create new work in sound.

Yet, except for a few highly conspicuous projects like a recent reproduction of Orson Welles's "War of the Worlds" (which itself has one foot in the past), funders and the press focus on radio's nostalgia elements.
