Asked whether he was directing the Florida Legislature's leaders, Mr. Bush replied, ''We're both being kept abreast of the options and opportunities. I decided that it was best to take our case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which will be heard tomorrow. All options are on the table, but one of our strategies is to get this election ratified and the sooner the better for the good of the country.''

The select committee, made up of eight Republicans and six Democrats, voted along party lines after two hours of impassioned debate this morning. Each side warned that history would judge the other harshly, and each side contended that it was acting in defense of Florida's voters without regard to the presidential ambitions of either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush. Although members strained to maintain a polite tone, there was no disguising the partisan fury that has infused both sides.

''What the hell is going on?'' Tom Rossin, the leading Democrat in the state Senate, asked the committee this morning. ''Is this America? Is this democracy? Is this the legacy we want for our children?''

Another Democratic senator, Betty S. Holzendorf of Jacksonville, said she was so disgusted by the whole affair that she planned to skip the special session. ''I'm going on vacation,'' she said.

For their part, Republicans accused Democrats of ignoring their oath of office, of shirking their constitutional obligations and of putting Mr. Gore's interests ahead of an entire state. The Democrats, they asserted, were aiding Mr. Gore in an effort to tie up Florida's election results in court challenges so that he would win by default with a majority of the remaining electoral votes.

''Since our motives -- the motives of the majority -- have been presumably exposed by some members of the committee, maybe this exposes the alternative motive, which is to elect Vice President Gore by our own inaction,'' said Senator Daniel Webster, a Republican. ''Today is the day to act.''

Fully aware of polls showing the political risks of intervening, Mr. Webster and other Republican members said they regretted calling for a special session. But they said they had felt compelled to act because of uncertainty, which they blamed entirely on recent election rulings by the Florida Supreme Court and on Mr. Gore's decision to contest the results. Those actions, they said, had placed the outcome of Florida's election in doubt and thus posed a ''significant risk'' that Florida's six million voters would not be represented in the Electoral College.
