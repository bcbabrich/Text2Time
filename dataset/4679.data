But then about halfway through "The Diversity of Life," you come to a chart that traces the full geological history of life from four billion years ago to the present. At intervals along a horizontal line there appear little lightning bolts to designate when "biodiversity was sharply reduced by the great extinction spasms." There are six of these in all. The first, for example, appears 450 million years ago at the dividing line between the Ordovician Period and the Silurian. The fifth marks the cataclysmic end of the Age of Reptiles, some 65 million years ago. But here's the shocker: The last lightning bolt appears just to the right of zero years ago, or a few decades from now. We are coming up on the sixth "major extinction spasm" in the history of life on earth.

This casts a considerable pall over the story Mr. Wilson is telling. The more you think about it, the more you realize that even the good news is bad. For instance, the good news is that the struggle to protect elephants or whales is not merely about saving these charismatic creatures but rather about preserving the infinitely complex habitats of which such animals are only the most manifest glories. Yet if commercial interests are reluctant to hold back for spotted owls, why should they worry about subterranean worms or microscopic ticks?

Moreover, the ethical dilemmas portended by this book are depressing. Where it comes to the conflicting needs of a starving Ecuadorean peasant and a rapidly diminishing rain forest, who in good conscience can ask the peasant to lie down and die for the sake of genetic diversity he can only be aware of in the abstract?

As it turns out, this book does deliver much grim information. A pioneer in the field of biodiversity studies and the author of such works as "Sociobiology," "On Human Nature," "The Insect Societies" and "Biophilia," Mr. Wilson celebrates the complexity of evolution precisely to emphasize the extent of the catastrophe we face. Symmetry is everywhere in "The Diversity of Life." He stresses the interdependency of species so that he can emphasize the great extent to which severe damage to environments can ramify. He amazes us with the enormous numbers of species we have not yet identified so that he can shock us with the unknown amounts of life that may be on the way to extinction.

His bottom line is that by the roughest estimate there may be tens of millions of species now alive on the earth, of which only about 1.4 million, at most 10 percent, are known. "A 20 percent extinction in total global diversity, with all habitats incorporated, is a strong possibility if the present rate of environmental destruction continues," he concludes.
