What does the phrase “student voice” mean to you? What would it look like if you were to illustrate the concept?

That’s the challenge we put to you as we start to design our page for the June edition of The New York Times’s new quarterly Learning section.

We will be featuring some of the best writing from the nearly 10,000 teenagers who entered this spring’s Student Editorial Contest and wrote passionate, thoughtful essays on the issues they care about most — and we’d love to have student-created art to go with it.
