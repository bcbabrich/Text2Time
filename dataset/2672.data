4. Write a reaction paper suggesting a solution to the dispute.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-resources about the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election (copies of articles from The New York Times and other periodicals, computers with Internet access, etc.)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class for easier student access): “What are some reasons why voters might dispute the results of an election? What processes are available to air and address those concerns or accusations? What remedies are available?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers. Do you know of any examples where elections were held and results were not accepted? What happened? Encourage students to consider national, state and local elections, as well as school government elections and other types of political polls.

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Opposition Leader in Ukraine Rejects Offer by Official Winner” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041201wednesday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. According to the article, who was declared the official winner of Ukraine’s disputed presidential election?

b. What action is this man prepared to take?

c. What solutions did Viktor A. Yushchenko, the opposition leader, dismiss?

d. What accusation does Mr. Yushchenko make about the election results?

e. What impact has the election problems had on Ukraine’s central bank?

f. According to the article, what outcome was decided in Parliament?

g. How many judges make up Ukraine’s Supreme Court?

h. Which politicians took part in talks “last Friday”?

i. What does the election impasse reveal about Russia’s relationship with the West?

j. Which candidate does Russian president Vladimir V. Putin support?

k. According to Interfax news agency, how does Mr. Putin want the issue to be resolved?

l. What reasons does the article hint at for Viktor F. Yanukovich’s offer to hold another election?

m. Which half of Ukraine threatened to seek more power?

n. Under what condition did Mr. Yanukovich make his proposal?

3. Divide students into seven groups. Explain that they will be conducting a mock meeting of Ukrainian politicians, citizens and members of the global community to discuss the issues surrounding the 2004 presidential election with the goal of resolving the conflicts. To prepare for the meeting, each group will research a particular person or group with a specific interest in the outcome, and take that party’s point of view. Assign each group one of the following roles: Viktor F. Yanukovich; the challenger, Viktor A. Yushchenko; President Leonid D. Kuchma; Russia (and countries sharing its views); the United States (and countries sharing its views); citizens for Mr. Yanukovich; and citizens for Mr. Yushchenko.

To guide their research, students should consider the following questions (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):

-What perspective are you taking?

-What role do you have in the 2004 Ukrainian election and its aftermath?

-According to your point of view, what has happened regarding the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election?

-If applicable, what accusations have been made about you as a person or group? How do you respond to these accusations?

-Who are “your” natural allies?

-What is your motive for vocalizing your opinion about the election results? What do you hope to gain?

-Are you willing to negotiate? If so, on what points? If not, why not?

-What type of interest do you have in the election results? Why?

-How will the various outcomes of the election affect you and your interest?

-In your perspective, how might the problems of this election affect Ukraine?

-What result would be most favorable to you? Why?

-What result would be least favorable to you? Why?

Once research is completed, each group should recovene to consider its strategy for the meeting. To do so, they should consider the following questions (copied onto the board or into the same handout as above):

-What is your objective in the discussion?

-What points would you like to make? Consider observations, complaints, suggestions, arguments, etc.

-What is your agenda? What do you want to push for?

-Who are your natural allies?

-Who would need to be won over?

-What is your emotional state going into the meeting? Are you level-headed, angry, aggressive, conciliatory, etc.?

Then, each group should choose a spokesperson to role-play their party’s point of view in a mock meeting of Ukrainian politicians, citizens and members of the global community. Each spokesperson will express and represent their party’s concerns with the election results and ideas for a possible solution to the problem. The teacher should moderate the meeting, provide legal guidelines as they pertain to the constitution of Ukraine, and pose questions to guide student dialogue. Discussion questions may include, but are not limited to:

-What stance does each representative take with regard the manner in which the election was conducted or about the results?

-What does each stand to gain, and lose, if a particular candidate wins the election?

-What are the legal solutions to this problem?

-What are other solutions (such as diplomacy)?

-How would each party be affected by the various possible solutions?

Members of the audience – – as Ukrainian citizens – – should take notes on ideas they find interesting or controversial, and ask clarifying questions.

Once the mock meeting is complete, the class should discuss any large questions that remain, including points of fact. All students should take notes from class home with them to complete the homework assignment.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students write a position paper on the following (written on the board for students to copy before leaving class, or copied into a handout): “Explain your own views on how the problems with the 2004 Ukrainian election outcome should be resolved. How do you think this election can be decided fairly? Can the apparent rift in the Ukrainian populace be healed? Include facts and ideas mentioned in the article, found during the research process, and raised in the mock meeting held during class to support your ideas.”

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Can a politician – – or aspiring politician – – sincerely want only what is best for his or her country? Why or why not?

-Why do the United States and Russia have an interest in Ukrainian politics?

-How does a constitution protect the practices of a particular country?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics – How much does an election cost? Chart election-related costs, including expenditures by campaigns, special-interest groups, the government (to run the election and tabulate the results), etc. Focus on an election of your choice for which data is available.

Fine Arts – Create a series of political cartoons that connect the 2000 United States presidential election with the 2004 Ukraine presidential election, which were both disputed.

Geography – Create a series of maps illustrating the political makeup of the European region where Ukraine is located before and after the breakup of the USSR. Include a brief explanation of the new countries that were formed.

Teaching with The Times – Compile newspaper clippings and photos related to the crisis over the presidential elections described in the article “Ukraine Parliament Fails to Agree on No-Confidence Vote.” Write an essay examining the impact the election results, as well as events after the election, have had on the Ukrainian people.
