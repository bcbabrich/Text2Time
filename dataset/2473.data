NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Sept. 29 - Neeme Jarvi seems pleased with himself, but in a generous sort of way that invites those around him to be pleased as well. At once warm, engaging and phlegmatic on the conductor's podium, he seems a bit of a showoff, but one who won't be really happy unless you enjoy the experience as much as he does.

You could say he works the room; he certainly works the orchestra, lavishing attention on the first violins, flicking the flutes into line with a finger.

All of this set a good tone on Thursday evening at his first official concert as music director of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, here at the State Theater.

The orchestra is certainly pleased with itself. Mr. Jarvi, a renowned and extensively recorded conductor, represents quite a catch for an institution accustomed to being overshadowed by the New York music scene. And after a difficult period chiefly noted in the press for the to-do about a set of rare but evidently overvalued string instruments that it acquired from the collector Herbert Axelrod, since indicted for tax evasion, the orchestra is eager to turn over a new leaf. "New Leader, New Sound, New Era," trumpets a slogan on the front of the program, with a picture of Mr. Jarvi looking particularly cuddly.
