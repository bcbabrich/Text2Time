A right-handed hitter, facing Sandy Alomar, the Mets' bench coach, Blake stroked some balls toward the warning track, more than 300 feet from home plate, bouncing one ball over the fence for what would have been a ground-rule double.

No sooner had Blake left the batting cage than three Discovery astronauts, who were in space from July 26 through Aug. 9, arrived in front of the Mets' dugout. It was known that Camarda, from Queens and Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, was a Met fan, but so, it turned out, was Collins, the flight commander.

"I grew up in Elmira in upstate New York and we watched Mets games on television," Collins said. "I can remember the 1969 World Series when I was 12, but this is my first visit to Shea."

Her husband, Pat Youngs, a pilot for Delta Air Lines, was wearing a blue golf shirt that said U.S. Amateur, having recently qualified for that golf tournament outside Philadelphia. He was eager for news about Mike Piazza's injured wrist.

After eight Taiwanese dancers performed a dragon dance, the three astronauts returned in blue flight suits and threw out the three baseballs, simultaneously, to three Mets coaches. The Taiwanese ambassador had thrown out a ceremonial first pitch. Some corporate executive would throw out yet another ceremonial first pitch just before game time. The planes from La Guardia Airport roared just behind the outfield. The message board boomed annoying commercials. Another normal, steamy, late-summer night in Queens.

The wild-card race, however, is not normal. In the yawning years between Bobby Valentine's pennant in 2000 and Randolph's upbeat debut this year, the Mets had some dreary Augusts and Septembers.

"Really nice, man," Floyd said. "It ain't been like that for the last two years. There's a change in the atmosphere."
