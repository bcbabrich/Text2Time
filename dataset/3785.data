To the Editor:

''Federal Funds for Clean Needles'' (editorial, Feb. 22) deplores ''the debate that focuses on politics and morality rather than public health needs.'' With great clarity you define much of our social strife. Awareness of one's own moral lapses will not prevent many of us from believing that morality is a nobler aim than health and, if mental and spiritual health are included, more efficacious.
