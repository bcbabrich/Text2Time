Right after the Knicks-Heat game last night at Madison Square Garden, Patrick Ewing, the injured Knicks' center, waited to enter the Miami locker room to see his longtime friend and fellow Georgetown alumnus, Alonzo Mourning, who was nursing not only some physical bruises, but also some mental hurts. This followed Mourning's fight on the court with 1.4 seconds left in the fourth quarter with Larry Johnson, the Knicks forward.

Ewing came in and spoke quietly to Mourning, as though an older brother saying something about you have to keep your head, when Mourning turned to his friend, and said: ''You saw the stuff he did, dirty,'' and he added an expletive. ''He was doing it the whole game. Cheap shots. Know what I'm saying?''

Johnson and Mourning had been going at it for much of the game, when a slap and a push and an elbow and fists suddenly flew.

Mourning had said that Johnson had been holding and grabbing him the entire game, a 90-85 Knick victory. ''Sometimes you just have to take a stand,'' Mourning said.
