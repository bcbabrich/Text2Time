Minutes after the State Assembly approved a bill that grants amnesty to delinquent taxpayers, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the measure into law.

Under the measure, state tax collectors will not impose any late fees, fines or interest payments. Officials are counting on the law to add $80 million to the treasury. Governor Whitman has drawn some criticism from Democratic lawmakers for signing a $4 million contract to promote the 90-day amnesty period even before the bill was considered by the State Senate last month.

The state raised $183 million in 1987, the only other time it offered amnesty to tax delinquents. The state has not set a starting date for this year's program.
