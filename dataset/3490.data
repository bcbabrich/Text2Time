A LEADING forecaster of advertising spending has raised his estimate for 1999 after cutting it earlier because of concerns about the worldwide economic turmoil last fall.

With those qualms virtually vanquished, and amid reports of robust first-quarter ad spending in myriad media, Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at the McCann-Erickson USA unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, is raising his predicted gain for 1999.

In December, the last time Mr. Coen offered predictions, ''we saw signs the economy was questionable,'' he said yesterday in a presentation at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan, ''and we were cautious.''

''But 1999 is turning out to be so much stronger than anybody expected,'' he added. ''We have a lot more stimulus than anyone thought possible six months ago.''
