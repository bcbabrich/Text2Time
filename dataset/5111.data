''He insisted on his own idea,'' President Yang complained in the speech, a copy of which was obtained from students and has been verified by people who heard it read in party meetings. ''When Comrade Deng Xiaoping attended the meeting, he still insisted on his idea.''

For Communist Party leaders, who for decades have felt secure when a single voice emanated from the party, there has been something deeply troubling about Mr. Zhao's unwillingness to be quiet. Mr. Zhao in his speeches never openly broke with his colleagues, but his televised speeches were more conciliatory toward the protesters than those of other officials, and President Yang appears convinced that this is what stimulated the democracy movement.

The old revolutionaries seem to regard the public as having little or no independent vitality, but are simply a weather vane to be directed by the force of the Communist Party or the force of opposing ''bourgeois liberalism,'' whichever is greater. Their fear is that divisions within the party will strengthen the enemy.

China's former President, Li Xiannian, complained that ''there are two headquarters'' in the party, and that this confused people and encouraged unrest. While in the West there is a political tradition that glorifies the lone dissenter who sticks to his principles, in the Politburo Mr. Zhao's persistence came across as impudence and treachery. The Question of a Plot

Indeed, there may be more to the situation than is now known, and no one can rule out the possibility of Mr. Zhao plotting against Mr. Deng. A member of Mr. Zhao's camp confirmed that the party General Secretary had directly challenged Mr. Deng's authority, and there are some hints that Mr. Zhao's aides may have tried to stir up unrest in the belief that it would help their man.

In 1976, when it was to his advantage, Mr. Zhao reacted to the purge of Mr. Deng by calling on the masses to ''thoroughly expose and criticize the crimes of Deng Xiaoping.'' On this occasion, once again, his own interests may have crossed Mr. Deng's.

Mr. Deng and his comrades may have felt they had little choice but to take the actions they did, if they were to hold on to the power they had grown used to. It was not necessarily a blunder - a miscalculation of the impact of suppression on Hong Kong, on the succession plans or on China's domestic political stability - but a response to a higher imperative, from the perspective of the old revolutionaries. They felt that it came down to the need to preserve their own power, and also the need to save China.
