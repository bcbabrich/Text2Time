They were trailing by 77-74 with six and a half minutes remaining, sagging from the strain of Jordan's energy drain, from front-line fouls, from the Pacers' defense and from their own lack of reliable depth.

Even after Toni Kukoc's 14-point perimeter explosion in the third quarter, the Bulls looked like a defending champion on the ropes, with that glazed bail-us-out-Michael look. Jordan, having entirely missed the rim on a couple of his most recent drives, persisted and drove into the lane. The long-armed Derrick McKey reached in as Jordan neared the basket and stripped Jordan of the ball. It rolled in the direction of Rik Smits. Jordan, falling backward, reached awkwardly around Smits. They both got their hands on the ball, and Jordan got a break when the whistle blew just as Smits was ripping it away.

Jordan somehow won the jump. Steve Kerr wound up with an open 3-point shot on the right wing. The game was tied. The message was sent. One way or another, Jordan was going to drag his team to Salt Lake City, to its sixth championship series. He had 28 points, 9 rebounds, 8 assists but had no knockout punches in him. What he had was heart and guile and the understanding, as he told his teammates, that it was time to ''shut up and play.''

Jordan's overall fatigue and, yes, his inevitable decline could be found in his shooting. Twenty-five shots attempted, nine made, and another five free throws missed. He was so tired that when he tried to drive at one point in the fourth quarter, he staggered, nearly to the floor.

''I was tired,'' he admitted. ''Very tired.''

Larry Bird's defense essentially worked. He still lost, and he, better than anyone, knew why. ''I remember when I was a player and not shooting well,'' Bird said. ''I had to help in any way I could. Michael's jump shot didn't beat us, but he put his head down and went at Rik. He distributed the ball, got some big rebounds. That's part of what makes him perhaps the greatest player ever.''
