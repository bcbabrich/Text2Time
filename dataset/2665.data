"In fact," said Dr. Hitchcock, "at a majority of the Catholic funerals I've attended in the last 10 years, some mention has been made of drinking habits. It seems to be done to signal that the deceased, now in heaven, was human, like the rest of us."

The Roman Catholic Church, tired of hearing stories like the one in New Jersey in which an uncle was remembered for taking his nephew to a brothel, has taken the sternest action against freewheeling eulogies. In January 2003, Archbishop John J. Myers of Newark ordered priests in his archdiocese to stop the laity from giving eulogies at funeral Masses.

Being denied the opportunity to give a eulogy recently did not discourage one grieving family in New Jersey. Their church would not allow anyone other than a clergyman to eulogize their loved one.

After the funeral Mass, the pallbearers carried the casket out to the sidewalk and stopped. Rented loudspeakers came out and several family members shared their memories of the deceased as the priest inside fumed.

"I couldn't believe it, it was pushing the envelope," said the funeral director who witnessed the insurgent eulogies. The funeral director did not want his name used or the rebel parishioners identified, for fear of hurting future business.

"I'm from a different generation," said the funeral director, a Catholic. "Something has changed."

But it is not just Catholics. Funeral directors report that Protestants, Jews, and Muslims and Hindus who have adopted American funeral customs have had problems with nontraditional eulogies.

In August, Jaye Zimet, a lesbian author from Brooklyn, died without warning at 43. She had always led an unconventional life. (For years, she colored her hair purple.) About 300 friends and relatives, including children, gathered in a Brooklyn funeral home for a traditional Jewish service. There, Ms. Zimet's friend Tory Klose stood to say a few words.
