SARAH VAUGHAN was in a frisky mood on Wednesday night at Avery Fisher Hall, where she headlined a program entitled ''Sassy the Great.'' Appearing with her trio, she performed an extended set that opened with a scat rendition of ''Autumn Leaves'' and culminated with a version of ''Misty,'' part of which was sung as an amusing male impersonation in the singer's booming contralto.

An aura of caricature has always shaded Miss Vaughan's singing, for her beautiful, apparently ageless voice is itself larger than life. Even when she is being relatively demure, one knows that a moment later Miss Vaughan will open up her voice and swoop upon a phrase or just a single crucial word, twisting it through surprising timbral changes.

The highlights of her jazz festival concerts were three songs - ''Lush Life,'' ''My Funny Valentine'' and ''Send in the Clowns'' - that lend themselves to this sort of dramatic tonal coloration especially well, since in one way or another, they all deal with appearances and artifice. For ''My Funny Valentine,'' Miss Vaughan brought out the song's comedic element, by caricaturing someone whom the song might be addressing. It was a daring, touching and funny interpretation, in which Miss Vaughan consciously emphasized the freakish qualities of her voice to achieve an exaggerated lyricism.

The evening opened with a strong set by the saxophonist Richie Cole and his quartet, Alto Madness, who were joined by the trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and Mr. Hubbard's brilliant protege Jon Faddis. The pair also performed ''My Funny Valentine.'' In a wildly propulsive dueling-trumpet arrangement, Mr. Hubbard's robust, swaggering style handsomely complemented Mr. Faddis's more piercing, speedier approach, which also included some phenomenal high notes.
