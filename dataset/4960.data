Q. Is it hard on a dog or cat to be left alone all day?

A. It's hard on dogs, because they're social animals. Their ancestors and relatives live in packs. So having more than one dog would be best, because they love the companionship. However, if you can't do that, you can put the dog in a crate when you're not there, and they'll feel more secure. Take wolves or coyotes, for instance. When the parents are out hunting, they leave the pups in a small enclosed area of the den that's very confined. But when dogs are in an open space all alone and unprotected, then they're going to feel unsure and insecure.

Cats, being loners, don't want other cats around. In fact, they are the only domestic animal that are loners. A lot of people think that since they're off working during the day that they should get a companion for their cat so it won't be lonely. But a cat sees another cat as someone invading his territory.

Sometimes two cats will get along fine, especially if they are from the same litter and have grown up together. But sometimes, when you have two cats together, you might find that even though they are getting along, one of them may be urinating around the house to show that he or she is dominant. If someone really wants a companion for a cat, though, you can avoid all those problems by getting the cat a dog.

The cat can ignore a dog; cats can ignore anything but another cat. The dog loves it, because it's another living thing there. It's not alone. The thing that comes to mind is Garfield. He would be very happy if Odie, the dog, walked off the end of the earth. Whereas Odie absolutely adores Garfield, he follows him everywhere. But you never see Garfield following Odie. Now there's a cartoonist who knows his pets.

Q. What's the best way to housebreak a dog?

A. Usually by putting the dog in a crate or a very confined space when you're not around, because puppies are not going to soil their own nest. Usually a kitchen is going to be on the large side. You can put them in the bathroom or some place that is very small. At the same time, you have to encourage them to do it outside. When you let them out in the morning, for instance, take them right outside, then praise them. Then wait until they go, and praise them again. It will take several weeks, but the dog will eventually begin to show you when he wants to go out.

Q. How common is feline leukemia?

A. It's not all that easy to pick up, because most animals have the ability to fight off diseases. In one study on feline leukemia, they found that 40 percent of cats have a natural immunity to the disease. Another study involving stray cats that have been exposed to the virus found that two-thirds of those cats have been able to throw off the virus.

Q. What are the symptoms of Lyme disease in animals?
