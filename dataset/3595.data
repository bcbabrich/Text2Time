Adam Mann was 5 years old and weighed only 35 pounds when he finally died on March 5, 1990. He had been abused for some time. When he was wheeled into the emergency room of Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in the Bronx his body was covered with thick welts, severe lacerations and deep ugly bruises. His head and lips were battered and swollen, as if he'd been in a prizefight.

Over time, in an insane sequence of beatings at the hands of his father, Rufus Chisholm, and his mother, Michelle Mann, Adam had suffered broken bones, liver damage and had his teeth knocked out. At one point, in the attack that eventually killed him, he was hung from a coat hook and beaten.

Adam had four siblings who, at the time of his death, ranged in age from 8 months to 9 years. All but the youngest child (the only girl) were grotesquely abused. Adam's brothers were regularly whipped, burned and beaten. The litany of their injuries included a broken leg, broken wrist and fractured skull.

Although aware of potentially disastrous problems with the family, child welfare officials did not intervene in a meaningful way until Adam was killed. The surviving youngsters were placed in foster care. Rufus Chisholm pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and is in prison. Michelle Mann served time for assault and was released from prison in 1994.
