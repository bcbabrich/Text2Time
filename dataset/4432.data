"Satisfied vanity revealed becomes fatuity. This is the rather impertinent name which the hypocrites of modesty -- that is to say everybody -- have invented, because they are afraid of genuine feelings." So wrote Jules Barbey D'Aurevilly in "Dandyism," published in 1897. Mr. D'Aurevilly meant to defend men of fashion against public scorn; but his words apply, almost a century later, to the much-maligned world of pop metal.

The rock establishment considers this musical style, which the Boston group Extreme brought to its pinnacle on Friday night at the Beacon Theater, frivolous and technically lightweight. In fact, the members of Extreme would probably flinch to hear the label applied to them. Live, however, the band is pure pop metal, and gloriously so. Its key assets are the very ones that make rock's "hypocrites of modesty" uncomfortable: bold showmanship and sensual pride.

The band's singer, Gary Cherone, strutted like a jazz dancer doing a strip routine; his well-toned body and theatrical costumes highlighted an unabashed sexuality. Nuno Bettencourt, the guitarist, was theatrical in a different way. He often commandeered the spotlight to perform lengthy solos that were as florid as they were masterly.

Mr. Bettencourt is a genuinely innovative guitarist, blending a machine-gun arpeggio technique with lyrical jazz rock and a picking style influenced by flamenco and bluegrass. His guitar is the cornstarch in Extreme's sound, saving it from becoming thin and drippy. But Mr. Cherone's Broadway-style pizazz separates the group from the mass of preening "hair bands." He worked the stage with a panache that would have made Liza Minnelli green.
