To the Editor:

It is understandable that Jane Brody would be so negative about low-carbohydrate diets, since her books advocate a completely different approach to healthy eating. But low-carbohydrate diets really do work and eating (even complex) carbohydrates really can be fattening.

I have lost 22 pounds and my cholesterol levels and blood pressure have dropped since March 1, 1999, when I started following the guidelines in ''Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.'' When I reach my goal, weight, I will change to the maintenance diet, which allows more carbohydrates, but I will never ever allow myself to eat as many carbohydrates as Ms. Brody would recommend.
