Ed van der Elsken Howard Greenberg Gallery 120 Wooster Street (near Prince Street) SoHo Through Oct. 16

The Dutch photographer Ed van der Elsken, who died in 1990, specialized in gritty pictures of the underworld of the Netherlands, Paris, Tokyo and elsewhere. This show, the first presentation of his work in the United States since 1955, includes a selection of pictures from throughout his career.

The photographs blend aspects of Robert Frank's melancholy romanticism with Weegee's harsh fascination with the underside of city life. Van der Elsken could find appropriately dark subjects no matter where he went: in Amsterdam, he recorded crowds of young men outside a strip joint; in Osaka, Japan, he photographed gangsters in suits and fedoras, lined up like the Blues Brothers.

A sweetness underlies the tawdry surface of many of these scenes. In one picture from the Netherlands, teen-agers in black leather jackets and short skirts pause uncertainly during a dance; in a 1953 shot from Paris, a young woman kisses her image in a mirror.
