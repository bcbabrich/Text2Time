One day last week a visitor to the Metropolitan Museum found herself smiling back at a man who was gazing impishly, even flirtatiously, at her. He had curly hair, big eyes and was wearing what appeared to be a turtleneck sweater. His last name was Lesueur. His first she does not know, nor ever will. He died in 1876.

Lesueur, an actor, was one of the many famous friends and acquaintances photographed, mostly in the mid-19th century, by a caricaturist and journalist who called himself Nadar and is now the subject of a major museum show. Nadar, a tall, burly man with hair that flies back from his face and a thick mustache, looks, in his self-portrait, like a handful. His wife, her eyes and lips narrowed and her body backing away from his camera, certainly seems to have thought so.

In truth, Nadar may or may not have thrown off heat and his wife may or may not have frosted the air around her. Such speculation is based only on a long, luxurious scrutiny of their images -- luxurious because one cannot afford to stare too long at actuality. Actuality -- living, breathing people -- gets angry ("Why are you looking at me that way?") or defensive ("I didn't sleep last night") or snippy ("So rude!"). Images remain serene.

Some photographs say more about their makers than they do of their subjects. And a photograph in a fashion magazine, however attractive the model, is meant to talk about what she, or he, is wearing. But the subject of a photograph by the Nadars of this world speaks to the viewer. Sometimes the viewer, like the woman who smiled at Lesueur, speaks back.
