HOLLYWOOD, Aug. 31—An actress who died nearly three decades ago has become the hottest property in Hollywood.

Three producers have announced their intention to do pictures about the' life of Jean. Harlow, and each insists that his picture will be the first to go before the public.

The last to make his announcement was Joseph E. Levine, who made known his plans today amid considerable pageantry at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Rising to address assembled reporters, Mr. Levine said that he had hired a director, Gordon Douglas, and decided on a title, “Jean Harlow.” He then added that he also decided on a star to play the film star and beckoned dramatically toward a nearby stage.
