But today's release, which represented the final government disclosures on three Americans killed in Chile during the dictatorship, disappointed family members and human rights activists. While the documents offered some details, they broke no new ground as to the circumstances under which the Americans died. In addition to Mr. Teruggi, they were Charles Horman, an American journalist whose plight was portrayed in the 1982 movie ''Missing,'' and Boris Weisfeiler, a mathematics professor who disappeared in 1985.

The Central Intelligence Agency released only six documents concerning Mr. Horman's death. It released a dozen or so more on the death of Mr. Teruggi, all concerning the attempts of the dead man's father to see a document the agency refused to release 24 years ago. The intelligence agency continued to withhold that document today, arguing that its information was provided by a foreign intelligence service.

Joyce Horman, whose husband was killed at age 31, held up documents no more than an inch thick, many with chunks of black lines keeping whole paragraphs secret. ''Either they're withholding documents,'' she said, ''or they really didn't do anything to protect an American citizen or to investigate his detention in Chile at that time.''

The only new insight Ms. Horman gleaned came from an informant who approached the United States Embassy in 1987 to say that Mr. Horman had been killed in the National Stadium the night of Sept. 19, 1973, for being a ''foreign extremist.'' On learning that the man they had killed was an American citizen, stadium officials panicked and had his body dumped on the streets, he said. But American Embassy officials had doubts about the informant's credibility, and lost contact with him.

About half of the documents released today involved Mr. Weisfeiler, 44, who apparently was picked up by the military while hitchhiking in Chile. His body was never recovered.
