The University of Connecticut standout DORON SHEFFER, believed to be Israel's best hope to crack the National Basketball Association barrier for the first time, has given up that dream for now and signed with a top team in his homeland. Sheffer, drafted in June by the Los Angeles Clippers after starring for three years at UConn, said yesterday he had decided to return home after realizing his chances of making the Clippers were ''close to zero.'' Sheffer said his three-year contract with the perennial Israeli champion Maccabi Tel Aviv contains an escape clause in case he is offered another chance with an N.B.A. team. (AP)
