Agnieszka Radwanska came into her third-round match-up with defending champion Maria Sharapova with a simple plan: “I’ve got nothing to lose, so I just hit the ball.”

She did. Sharapova didn’t. And just like that Radwanska, the 30th seed here, has become the toast of the tournament, ousting the No. 2 seed in three sets. Asked how she’ll feel about seeing her face on the front page of every newspaper tomorrow, the 18-year-old from Poland just smiled.

“Good. Very good.”

Although this was a monumental upset by any measure, it wasn’t by any means a fluke, despite the fact that Radwanska was until a few months ago as worried about graduating high school as she was about her professional career. After Radwanska passed her exams she was a rising star on the women’s tour, having won in Stockholm and reaching the 3rd round at Wimbledon.

As a junior, Radwanska won the French Open in 2005 and Wimbledon in 2006.

Today she showed great power (particularly off the forehand), stellar defense and that rarest of commodities: The ability to forget. After taking the first set 6-4 from Sharapova, Radwanska was by her own admission “destroyed” in the second, losing 6-1.

“But then I woke up,” she said, and let Sharapova help her help herself. Over the course of the third set, Sharapova missed on the forehand side, missed on the backhand side and missed on her serve.

“She helped me out a lot,” Radwanska acknowledged.

She also showed a sneaky streak, creeping inside the baseline Michael Chang-style, trying to draw the second serve error from Sharapova. In the seventh game, it worked, helping Radwanska to a 5-2 lead.

“I knew she didn’t like if somebody is moving if she is serving, so I was trying to do something like this,” she said.

Sharapova gave her opponent credit not just for that, but for not wilting under the pressure.

“A lot of girls in her position, in a big stadium against a top player sometimes get a little nervous. She held on there, and all the credit to her for winning the match,” she said after the match.

So what’s the first order of business for Radwanska now? She’ll pay off a bet she made with her sister.

“If I beat her, we will buy two Louis Vuitton bag,” she said. After the match, her sister came to the locker room. “Okay, now we’re going to Louis Vuitton.”
