To the Editor:

Have we become so politically correct that we have lost our sense of humor and found a new issue for possible lawsuits? I can't see firing someone -- in whom you have invested time, money and training -- over an E-mail.

As I gather from the example, someone in a workplace found a message offensive, but no one was touched, groped or whispered to. It would be more cost-effective for a company to suspend someone over this, rather than cut off the nose to spite the face.
