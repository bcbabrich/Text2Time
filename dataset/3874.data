Been there, done that, won that. And there's no time like the present to do it again.

Monica Seles and Andre Agassi, both former United States Open champions, are convinced that their stars are finally on the rise again and are tired of talking about how much more intrepid they were in their self-described former lives. Back then Seles had not been stabbed and was fearless, and Agassi was balancing Grand Slam titles with celebrity. Now both are trying to get on with the business of reasserting, and reinventing, themselves on the Grand Slam front.

Yesterday at the Open, the second-seeded Seles and the unseeded Agassi punched in for their assignments at Arthur Ashe Stadium and reclaimed a level of competitiveness that left their opponents drained, bedraggled and wishing they had caught the two revivalists on an off day.

Though Seles allowed the ninth-seeded Mary Pierce to dictate the power plays in their opening set, the two-time Open champion turned testy in the second. Up went the volume of her grunts, up went the velocity of her serves, and out went Pierce, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2. After giving Seles all manner of trouble in the opening set, Pierce caused none in the next two.

''Once she's on a roll, she doesn't let up,'' said Pierce, who admitted that the hints of vintage Seles -- the forehands jackhammered down the line, the nasty angles carved by her backhands -- were daunting. ''Over all, she's not as aggressive as she was before, but she still hits amazing shots.''
