Keely Garfield Dia Center for the Arts

If laughter is the best medicine, Keely Garfield ought to bottle herself, her performers and her dances as an over-the-counter cure for innumerable ills. The two new works she presented with her well-named Sinister Slapstick company on Friday were wicked, witty and full of prickly dance intelligence.

Both pieces could be loosely described as deconstructions, though Ms. Garfield blessedly makes no reference to the dread d-word. "One Hit Wonders" is a suite of five short pieces set to popular music whose lyrics are seen in a decidedly new way once Ms. Garfield is finished with them. Two of the three premieres in the suite also turn familiar dance genres on their heads.

"Precious Moments" ("A morning grope for the intimacy of the night before"), set to a rendition of the song by the Three Degrees, is a duet for male lovers in bathrobes and scuba flippers who find that the waning thrill of it all is more than a matter of their ridiculous footgear. There are no soulful allusions here to love that dares not speak its name, in a wryly funny performance by John Maynard and Eric Diamond.

In "Shirt Tales" ("Femmes amok in the laundry room of life"), five women in outsized brassieres and other odd bits of white underwear, white shirts hanging from their arms, come dangerously close to a parody of Alvin Ailey's "Cry" and other dances dedicated to long-suffering women. Set to music by Candi Staton, the piece was performed by Denise Griffin, Diana Hilgert, Eun-Gyu Lee, Rachel Lynch-John and Kathryn Tufano.
