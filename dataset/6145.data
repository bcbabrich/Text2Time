BOSTON, Jan. 1 (AP)—The Christian Science Monitor reports that about 150 Americans took refresher military training at Fort Benning, Ga., sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency last week to prepare to join 300 other Americans the paper said were fighting in Angola.

ln a dispatch from New York in The Monitor's Friday edition, a staff correspondent, David Anable, said that the Fort Benning group was part of a larger group of 300 who were “ready to go as soon’ as the C.I.A. can obtain further funds.”

The report atttibuted the information to “contacts with senior mercenary officers familiar with the situation both in Angola and the United States.” Those sources were described as “close to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.”

The 300 men in the “ready to go” group reportedly include 15 South Vietnamese, The Monitor says., The American members were said to be on indefinite leave from Army Special Forces units in this country or in the Panama Canal Zone or to be recently discharged soldiers.
