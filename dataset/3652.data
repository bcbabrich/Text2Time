To the Editor:

Stephen J. Gould (Op-Ed, May 29) argues that a biological window on human behavior provides little help in the search for sensible political structures. He thus must either believe that biology tells us little about human behavior or that human behavior does not much constrain our politics. But he cannot believe the first without rejecting the main proposition of Darwinism that man is an animal shaped by natural selection. He cannot believe the second without rejecting political philosophers like James Madison, who rested his support for the Constitution on his analysis of human nature.

Mr. Gould's view that the biology of sexuality and aging is largely irrelevant to politics makes one wonder what he would consider in making social policy. For example, if sexuality is such a powerful urge that men often do not think through its consequences, the absence of institutions like child support will allow them to transfer the costs of their acts to society.
