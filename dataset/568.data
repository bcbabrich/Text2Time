Anatomy of a Scene Directors offer behind-the-scenes narration on their films.

In this video, the director Tim Burton discusses a sequence from his film “Big Eyes,” based on the life of the artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) and her husband, Walter (Christoph Waltz), who takes credit for her artwork. Some of the look of the scene, Mr. Burton said, was inspired by the films of the Italian director Mario Bava. He also discusses the quiet, internal performance given by Ms. Adams.
