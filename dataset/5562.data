Bruce Sheffield, paused on his rounds in downtown Los Angeles today to think, like many others, about the effects of the fire that raged through the city's 60-year-old Central Library Tuesday.

''They'll never be able to replace it,'' said Mr. Sheffield, a 65-year-old letter carrier who said he first made use of the research facility in 1939 while he was a student at Los Angeles City College.

Mr. Sheffield is one of thousands of downtown workers who catch occasional small glimpses of the library, a three-story structure that has been described as Egyptian-Byzantine in style.

The library, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, survived Tuesday's conflagration better than most has expected.
