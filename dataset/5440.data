REMEMBER in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' how the little birdies help the heroine get ready for her day? One of them even fluttered about carrying a ribbon for her hair?

Well, some of that birdie's relatives have been conscripted to work in a new animated spot for Ice Mountain Maine Spring Water, which just began advertising itself this week in New England. What makes it important, in addition to the birds, is that it is Pepsico's first entry into the fast-growing $1.7 billion bottled water market.

But in the 30-second commercial by Waring & LaRosa, beautiful white doves soar oer hill and rill as the singer sings ''somewhere on Ice Mountain halfway to the skies, pure spring waters rise, fresh as morning dew.'' Then two birdies appear carrying a blue banner that they wrap around a big snow-covered mountain. The banner says, ''Ice Mountain,'' and in a flash the mountain with its banner becomes a label on a large bottle, all done to the singing of Lucy Simon, sister of Carly.

The magic of television. * * *

The commercial is running on 13 stations in three television markets reaching four cities: Boston, Providence, R.I., Hartford and New Haven. The advertising will run during the day and in the early evening, aimed at mothers with large families. There are no print ads.
