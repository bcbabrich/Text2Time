Mr. Dinkins is seeking concessions from city unions in an effort to avert some or all of the layoffs, and late last night city officials were considering a proposal from union leaders that would avert many layoffs through a wage deferral, an early-retirement program and stepped up attrition.

City officials discounted the possiblity of an imminent agreement. Asked if he was optimistic, Barry Feinstein, the teamsters union leader, said: "It depends on what they come back with. All the elements for a solution are on the table."

In reaching an agreement, Mr. Dinkins was forced to give way on tax increases that he had fought vigorously for over many weeks, and to embrace a budget that included service cuts he considered unthinkable only a few months ago.

But at the same time, succeeding in putting together any kind of budget at all under such adverse circumstances could serve the Mayor well in the face of relentless questioning of his administration's ability to manage the city's affairs. And it also makes calls for a takeover of the city's finances by the state's Financial Control Board seem a far more distant possibility. Sweet Compromise for Some

For the often maligned Council, the compromise was sweet. By fighting both for lower taxes and fewer service cuts, Council members gained political capital to use in the November elections. And by dropping plans to pass their own budget -- after establishing it as a credible threat -- they avoided the risks of a prolonged fight with the Mayor.

The budget agreement came so late, that negotiators said it would take most of the night to fill in all the details and most of today to print the budget, delaying the adoption until tonight at the earliest. Some Council aides said the delay was the longest in at least several decades.

But with the city's fiscal problems so severe, many officials were predicting that whatever budget was put into place now would soon change to take into account concessions from municipal unions or the further decline in the city's fiscal picture forecast by the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman.
