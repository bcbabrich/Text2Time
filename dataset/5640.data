The Air Force, deciding a long and bitter battle between the Northrop Corporation and the General Dynamics Corporation, chose today to buy the General Dynamics F-16 fighter plane in a deal that will be worth billions of dollars.

The Air Force also selected two teams, one headed by Northrop and the other by the Lockheed Corporation, to design another new fighter plane.

In the contest between Northrop and General Dynamics, the F-16, already widely used in the Air Force and in many foreign countries, edged Northrop's F-20, designed by the company at a cost of $1 billion without ever attracting a buyer. Contest Required

Northrop supporters have argued that the F-20 would provide competition and thus lower aircraft costs. They pressed legislation through Congress requiring the Air Force to have a contest between the planes for the job of defending the United States against attacking bombers. The Air Force plans to equip 270 planes for that job, replacing fighters designed in the 1960's.
