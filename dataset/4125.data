In Mr. Mo's case, his publisher, Chatto & Windus, owned by Random House, refused to meet his request for an advance of $:200,000, or $316,000. Nor did other British publishing houses. "We just couldn't see our way to paying an advance on that scale; neither could other publishers in London," said Jonathan Burnham, the publishing director at Chatto. "It's all a matter of sliding scales and authors' reputations. And Martin Amis has now completely thrown the scale out of joint." Mr. Amis recently stunned London's publishing world by commanding an advance of roughly three-quarters of a million dollars for his forthcoming novel, "The Information."

Miffed, Mr. Mo announced he would self-publish his new book, a black comedy set in the Philippines, and taunted his publishers with the remark that the new book has "the filthiest opening chapter of any book ever published." Three of his earlier works, including his latest book, "The Redundancy of Courage" (1991), were on the short list for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award.

"I think I may have got $:150,000 or $:175,000 if the book had gone to auction," Mr. Mo, who in his early 40's, told The Guardian. "But I perceived I was no longer seen as the bright young man. Nor was I yet a grand old man of literature. I wanted to take control. I am fed up relying on others."

Mr. Burnham, of Chatto, said the parting with Mr. Mo went "amicably." "I think he's extremely brave, and I'm very pleased for him that he's doing this," Mr. Burnham said. "It's a very tricky experiment. But he may well pull it off."

Mr. Mo, who was born in Hong Kong, told The Guardian that if he sells 1,000 hardback copies and 9,000 trade paperbacks, he should make a profit of about $:25,000, or $39,500. He may break even with about 3,000 sales. "The money will flow to me," he said, "rather than the publisher." What's Old

For penny-wise publishers, nothing feels as good as getting to recycle old books with a link -- no matter how tenuous -- to current events.

So it goes with Penguin and a 1972 book by F. Lee Bailey, a lawyer for O. J. Simpson. The book, "The Defense Never Rests," has no relation to the Simpson murder case other than two new lines on its jacket. The front cover reads: "O. J. Simpson's acclaimed defense attorney recreates his most famous wife-murder cases." The back cover notes that the cases described in the book "give us insight into why he is now one of the lead defense attorneys in 'The Trial of the Century': the O. J. Simpson trial." A New Name
