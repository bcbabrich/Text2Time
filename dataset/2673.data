Where Mr. Clarke is the high priest of sci-fi's faith in the human intellect manifest in technology, Mr. Ballard and the others regard technology as a dangerous extension of human psychopathology. Thus in "Crash" the automobile is a tool for sex and self-destruction. In "High-Rise" and the more recent "Cocaine Nights" and "Super-Cannes," the globally replicated blandness of modern cities, highways and airports is the environment of a new totalitarianism that is, he says here, "docile and subservient, and all the more threatening for that." "The New Totalitarians come forward," he writes, "smiling obsequiously like head waiters in third-rate Indian restaurants, and assuring us that everything is for our benefit."

Technology not only threatens but also disappoints. Mr. Ballard is almost cruel on the collapse of the space age. Rockets "belong to the age of the 19th century, along with the huge steam engines. It's brute-force ballistic technology that has nothing to do with what people recognize as the characteristic technology of this century: microprocessors, microwave data links -- everything that goes in the world at the speed of an electron."

Worse, the space race made for lousy television. "The suspicion dawned that Outer Space might be -- dare one say it -- boring. Having expended all these billions of dollars on getting to the Moon, we found on our arrival that there wasn't very much to do there."

Mr. Ballard saw the World Trade Center attack as a kind of brutal intrusion of the imminent future into the present. "The attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 was a brave attempt to free America from the 20th Century," he opines. "The deaths were tragic, but otherwise it was a meaningless act." And in another passage: "The horrific newsreels are effectively the greatest disaster movie to date. My fear is that in due course the 'remake' of 9/11, with the ultimate in special effects, will inspire Americans to more than revenge."

He is not usually so callous. In 2001, he remarked: "Americans are highly moralistic, and any kind of moral ambiguity irritates them. As a result they completely fail to understand themselves, which is one of their strengths." And this feels like inescapable truth: "The president of the United States bears about as much relationship to the real business of running America as does Colonel Sanders to the business of frying chicken."
