Those, and a few chairs, are just about the only props you’ll find in Mr. Cummings’s production. As the artistic director of Transport Group, he is known for minimalist, or essentialist, stagings, like an endearing unisex version of “I Remember Mama” in 2014. Doing more with less is also the house style of Classic Stage under John Doyle, who has revived musicals as different as “Sweeney Todd” and “The Color Purple” by depriving them of distracting stagecraft.

But this “Summer and Smoke” has been scraped too close to the bone. Dane Laffrey’s big white shoe box, or coffin, of a set conveys all too well Alma’s empty prospects but offers nothing to suggest either the suffocating trap of her Victorian circumstances or the richness and romance of her imagination. Her statue of Eternity is not even stone; it’s a framed photograph.

Williams specified minimalism — no doors or windows — but he meant something more poetic by it. In his production notes he refers to de Chirico and Renaissance paintings as a way of suggesting the natural world Alma must finally embrace. Which is not to say “Summer and Smoke” is hopeful; Alma and John convert each other too late, ending up, once again, on opposite sides of love. But it mustn’t play out its bleakness too soon or there’s nothing to lose, and thus no drama.

Ms. Ireland’s imagination is so well calibrated that she manages, almost single-handedly, to correct for that distortion. If this “Summer and Smoke” were performed silently you could still understand the story from her physicalization of Alma’s character. More than that, her manic laughter, gulping breaths and drooping shocks are carried off with such authenticity that they reframe hysteria as a natural, even brave, response to deprivation and constant insult.

But of course a silent performance would not be Williams, and if much of the dialogue has a high butterfat content, Ms. Ireland delivers it naturally. Mr. Darrow, properly dashing and tortured as John, hasn’t quite achieved that facility; his emphasis on the character’s self-loathing and cynicism sometimes makes him seem hollow instead of harrowed.

Williams is partly to blame. John’s feelings for Alma aren’t as clear as hers are for him, and he often hovers, like the rest of the residents of Glorious Hill — especially the stereotypically “passionate” Mexican family that runs the local casino — on the verge of caricature. Williams tried to solve these problems with massive rewriting; the result was “The Eccentricities of a Nightingale,” which puts the main characters in a rather different framework.

“Eccentricities” is an improvement, but “Summer and Smoke” is nevertheless Williams, with veins of rich pathos to be mined from its melodrama. Surely its central question remains profound: Why do we fall in love with a person’s struggle instead of with the person himself? If this revival doesn’t address that question convincingly except in its central performance, I don’t blame the cast, which also features Tina Johnson as the local busybody, Ryan Spahn as a traveling salesman and Hannah Elless as a pupil of Alma’s who turns out to be a rival.

No, it’s the parsimony of the production that’s at fault, offering little that’s lovely except Michael John LaChiusa’s original music, in an apt neoclassical mode. Perhaps it’s fitting that music should be the one element that gives you a taste of what this “Summer and Smoke” might have been with such an eloquent Alma if it hadn’t, like her, spent so much energy stifling its passion.
