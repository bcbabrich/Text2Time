A jury decided today that British commandos acted within the law when they shot and killed three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas in this British colony last March.

Critics of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government have said the killings were part of an unofficial ''shoot to kill'' policy against members of the I.R.A. But the 11-member jury ruled that the commandos of the Special Air Service acted lawfully when they killed Daniel McCann, Sean Savage and Mairead Farrell on March 6 as the three walked toward the Spanish border. The jury's vote was 9 to 2.

After the verdict, Nyall Farrell, the brother of Miss Farrell, said: ''This is a Pyrrhic victory for the Crown Counsel. There was a split decision.'' Michael Hucker, lawyer for the soliers, called the ruling ''total vindication.'' Fear of Car Bomb

The commandos testified at the inquest that they believed that the three I.R.A. members were prepared to detonate a car bomb by remote control, and that the three made threatening moves when confronted. The I.R.A. has acknowledged that the three were on ''active service,'' meaning they were on a mission to strike against a British target, at the time of their deaths.
