Among the 30 Jews on the stage was Ignatz Bubis, a builder and prominent Jew. In the course of the evening's heated exchanges, Mr. Cohn-Bendit and other speakers in the audience asserted that Mr. Bubis was Mr. Fassbinder's prototype for a character in the play called The Rich Jew.

Mr. Bubis, who survived the war in Poland, was asked at one point if he did not fear that the anti-Fassbinder protest would deepen anti-Semitism in West Germany rather than check it. ''My parents left Germany in 1935,'' said Mr. Bubis, his hands firm on a length of the protest banner. ''If what you say came to pass I might have to emigrate too.''

The Jews were challenged to explain how they could be certain that a play was anti-Semitic when it had never been performed. Mr. Ruhle insisted that his dramatization of the Fassbinder text had taken care to avoid an anti-Semitic slant. He said the character called The Rich Jew in the original text was given a name, ''A,'' in his version.

Another of the protesters, Josef Choupack, said: ''I was in Bergen-Belsen, and I remember when Goebbels said that it was he who decided who was a Jew. And I say that we decide what is anti-Semitic.''

From the first row, Christian Raabe, a Frankfurt lawyer, rose and said that he was half-Jewish on his mother's side. ''I have read this play twice, and carefully, I think,'' he said. ''And I have come to the conclusion that The Rich Jew is the only human figure in the play. I believe it is not correct for one group of the population to say that only their opinion is correct.''

As protesters and members of the audience took the floor in a free-form debate, President Reagan's visit to the Bitburg cemetery with Chancellor Helmut Kohl last May became an issue. Mr. Reagan was criticized for visiting the cemetery because some of the graves were of Waffen SS soldiers.

''Here we want to start,'' said Michel Friedman, a 29-year-old Christian Democratic member of the Frankfurt legislature. ''We also demonstrated at Bitburg, but we were not enough. We are only 30,000 Jews in the country, and we cannot do what 60 million Germans should do.''
