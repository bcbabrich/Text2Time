Until now all new works submitted for consideration had to include a completely notated score as well as a live recording. With the new definition a recording of a work that has no written-out score will be deemed sufficient, which will certainly lend a new dimension to the deliberations of the five-member jury that selects three finalists for consideration by the full board. The changes are sure to please the composer John Adams, who after receiving the award in 2003 for ''On the Transmigration of Souls,'' a New York Philharmonic commission written in response to the 9/11 attacks, issued a blistering public critique of the prize. ''Among musicians that I know,'' Mr. Adams wrote at the time in a widely distributed e-mail message, ''the Pulitzer has over the years lost much of the prestige it still carries in other fields like literature and journalism.''

Anyone perusing the list of winners, he continued, cannot help noticing the absence of most of America's greatest musical minds, from mavericks like John Cage, Morton Feldman and Harry Partch, to composer-performers like Steve Reich, Laurie Anderson, Thelonious Monk and Meredith Monk. These creative spirits, he wrote, had been passed over year after year, ''often in favor of academy composers who have won a disproportionate number of prizes.''

In a recent interview Ara Guzelimian, senior director and artistic adviser at Carnegie Hall, who was a member of the jury for the 2004 music prize, said Mr. Adams's comments were taken by the board as ''very strong medicine.'' To its credit, he added, with this expansion of the category, the board has acknowledged ''that there is a larger realm of American music than has been represented so far.''

Not all composers will agree. The argument against the broadening will be that composers working in the commercial fields of film and musical theater already attract enormous attention and are eligible for high-profile Tony Awards and Oscars and such. Many of the composers often dubbed academic are deserving and accomplished creators who work in relative obscurity and benefit hugely by the prestige of the Pulitzer. You don't see the board opening the prizes in journalism to television correspondents and writers for online magazines.

Still, it's hard to deny that a music prize inaugurated in 1943 that has eluded towering figures in American music like Duke Ellington (who received a posthumous special citation in 1999 to commemorate his centennial), or Steve Reich, a finalist from last year, has been too constricted in its purview.
