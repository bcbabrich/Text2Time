The Westinghouse Electric Corporation is all but ready to announce its $5 billion bid to buy CBS Inc. Most of the details of the $81-a-share cash deal were sewn up yesterday, and the CBS board is scheduled to meet this morning to approve the offer, people with knowledge about the negotiations said.

If CBS directors give their blessing, as expected, the acquisition will be announced this afternoon in New York. A Westinghouse spokesman declined to comment.

In lining up the necessary financing from Chemical Bank and J. P. Morgan , the lead banks, Westinghouse has apparently agreed to sell between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in assets within two years. Proceeds from the sales would be applied immediately against the loan's principal, a person familiar with the terms said.

Some of those close to the transaction said that yesterday's $19 billion merger between the Walt Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC was having no effect on the Westinghouse-CBS marriage.
