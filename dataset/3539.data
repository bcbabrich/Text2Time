''NATIVE PATHS: AMERICAN INDIAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION OF CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 2; objects are being shown in three six-month installments; the first rotation ended in December, the second in May). Displayed in a somewhat out-of-the-way location, these works of pottery, basketry, beadwork, painting and sculpture, all on loan from a major private collection, are of incandescent beauty. They encompass nearly three centuries and a broad geographical range, from the Eastern woodlands stretching north into Canada, to the Great Plains, to the Northwest coast as far as Alaska. The result is a masterpiece exhibition that also introduces a major art tradition. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

''THE TIME OF OUR LIVES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Oct. 17). This alternately sappy and insightful exhibition is the swan song of Marcia Tucker, who is retiring as the founding director of the museum after 22 years. It is personal, topical, rough around the edges and intent on raising consciousness. It ignores most esthetic issues to bring together a broad array of art and artifacts, from paintings to television commercials, pertaining to a charged, often painful issue in our youth-driven society: growing old. There are some wonderful moments, several involving large photographs of the aged, with Manabu Yamanaka's images of spirited, time-ravaged ancient Japanese women being the most impressive. But the overall result is less an art exhibition than a multifaceted learning experience that too often sinks into an atmosphere of piousness, public service and pedagogy. The show's theme comes most to life in its film and video section, which ranges from choice segments of ''Maude'' and ''Cybill'' through animated short films like Gail Noonan's ''Your Name in Cellulite'' to Yvonne Rainer's complexly powerful ''Privilege,'' a meditation on time, memory and menopause. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 P.M.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3, students, artists and the elderly (Smith).

''ANDY WARHOL: 'THE LAST SUPPER,' '' Guggenheim Museum SoHo, 575 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 423-3500 (open-ended). It is always depressing to see an important artist operating below par, and it doesn't help that the Guggenheim's recently downsized SoHo space feels moribund or that the exhibition is ethically questionable. (The paintings are partly owned by a Guggenheim trustee who also owns the building.) The atmosphere hovers between gallery back room, gargantuan lobby exhibition and study collection. The 63 paintings and works on paper all appropriate Leonardo's ''Last Supper'' fresco in Milan. They show Warhol churning through his arsenal of once-brilliant techniques: the silk-screened grids of images, the camouflage pattern, the big close-ups, the quasi-commercial black-on-white renderings are all here, but they are rarely on target. The exhibition suggests that Warhol was at his weakest when he borrowed from art history. It was the transformation of the tawdry symbols of popular culture that gave his art its iconic power, emotional pull and ineffable mystery. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $8; $5, students and the elderly (Smith).

* ''A CENTURY FOR THE CENTURY: FINE PRINTED BOOKS 1900-1999,'' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through Nov. 13). A salute to fine-press publications printed in the 20th century, this exhibition features 100 judged the best by two experts, Martin Hutner and Jerry Kelly. Fine-press editions, which run from fewer than 100 to maybe 1,500 copies, are meant to glorify the written word with masterly use of typography, illustration, binding, layout, paper and press work. Those shown here, issued by presses in the United States and Europe, range from a small, witty salute to that useful connector, the ampersand, to books illustrated by Matisse and Picasso, to sober, monumental editions of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Among the most striking of the illustrated texts is Matisse's ''Jazz,'' published in France in 1947, an eye-feast of 20 full-color stencil prints inspired by the hot music of the time. But there are many remarkable texts that rely solely on the beauty of type, like the five-volume English Bible put out by the Doves Press in Britain (1903-05). The show leaves no doubt that despite the inroads of digital information storage, the art of fine-book publishing is alive and well (Glueck).

DONN DAVIS, Joseph Rickards, 1045 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street (212) 924-0858 (through Oct. 9). Mr. Davis, here having his first New York solo exhibition, combs the city for discarded typographic materials and creates abstract, gridded collages of certain elements like o's or x's. They are elegant and catchily rhythmic. (Johnson).

SAMUEL GOTTSCHO, ''New York: Night and Day,'' Allan Klotz Photocollect, 22 East 72d Street, (212) 327-2211 (through Oct. 23). The careful, patient architectural photographs of Manhattan made by Gottscho (1875-1971) during the early 1930's were a reaction to what he considered the sloppy work produced by the new, fast 35-millimeter cameras. By daylight his photographs were clearly delineated views, panoramas, skylines or close-ups of single structures, like a spectacular view of the RCA Building that looks up at the structure's towering geometry. By night, he captured the city's glamorous glow, for example, in a view of Broadway and Times Square from 41 stories up in which lights blazing from animated signs and the darkened bulk of buildings give real dimension to the moniker ''The Great White Way.'' Aside from its esthetic appeal, the show is a great wallow in New York nostalgia (Glueck).
