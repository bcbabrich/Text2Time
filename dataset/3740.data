Expanding into a lucrative corner of the cardiovascular device market, Medtronic Inc., the big pacemaker manufacturer, announced yesterday that it would buy Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc. for $54 a share, or $3.7 billion, in Medtronic stock.

The announcement was a windfall for Arterial Vascular shareholders, including dozens of company employees, pumping the share price to a 52-week high of $50 before it slipped to $48.875 in Nasdaq trading, up $16.50 for the day. Medtronic shares fell $2.375, to $67.625.

It was the second big expansion in less than a month for Medtronic, which announced a $3.6 billion purchase, also financed with Medtronic stock, of the Sofamor Danek Group on Nov. 2. Sofamor Danek makes rods and screws used in back surgery and imaging devices for brain surgery. Arterial Vascular makes tiny flexible tubes called stents that are inserted to prop open clogged arteries.

William W. George, chief executive of Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, said that by acquiring Arterial Vascular Engineering, Medtronic would have the ''best in class products'' in several important types of cardiological devices. Teams of Medtronic and Arterial Vascular salespeople would jointly promote the products to specialized physicians at big hospitals, who are eager to try the newest and presumably most effective devices.
