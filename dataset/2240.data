“Look at that!” said my companion, pointing to a glass of a French rosé that a server at Bouchon Bakery had just given me.

“I know — I love the color,” I answered.

“Not the color,” she said. “The pour!”

I had noticed that, too. In fact it was the first thing I noticed. Although the stemless glass was broad, the level of wine in it rose high, indicating a generous measure. But I hadn’t assumed it was what she was talking about, because I don’t assume that everybody — correction: anybody — is as concerned with the volume of wine in his or her glass as I am.

How concerned am I?

When a server puts an already-filled glass of wine on the table, the amount of wine instantly draws my attention. It’s my go-to appraisal, my litmus test: is this place being stingy and prissy or is it encouraging people to indulge, making them feel appreciated and amply nourished?

When a server puts an empty glass on the table, lifts a bottle of wine, tilts the bottle toward the glass and then begins to fill that glass, my breath catches for a second. My heart skips a beat. (OK, I’m exaggerating, but — trust me — only slightly.) I want as much of that wine as a restaurant can reasonably be expected to provide.

And, I confess, I want a bit more of that wine than a principled connoisseur would counsel. You know: there’s supposed to be a certain amount of air in the glass so that the wine can open properly, so that its perfume has adequate space in which to swim and swirl toward your nose.

I’ve got nothing against swimming, and I emphatically endorse swirling, but I also like a few extra sips before I have to ask for my next glass. (For the purposes of this post and discussion, I’m talking about wines by the glass. The amount of wine a server pours from a bottle under my control is immaterial. If I want more, I’ll pick up the bottle myself.)

I shared some of these thoughts with my companion at Bouchon, who in turn shared a story about Washington Park, a restaurant that once sat on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street in Greenwich Village. She and her husband had dined there one evening, and a server poured them some wine by the glass, and when they looked at the liquid in the glasses, it seemed puny indeed.

So they summoned the server, who snappishly said, “That’s our standard five-ounce pour.”

There was something so joyless and rigid about the statement, my companion recalled, that it became a sort of code phrase that she and her husband subsequently used to signal uptight situations. One of them would turn to the other and blurt, “That’s our standard five-ounce pour.”

Neither of them likes the standard five-ounce pour.

Which raises the question: is five ounces a standard pour?

Yes, for the most part, and it’s a sensible pour, and sometimes, when you feel cheated, it’s because you got less than that. Sometimes it’s because the glass is so big that the volume of wine in it looks small. Context and optical illusion play parts in whether you feel you’ve been treated well.

Five-ounce pours allow restaurants to get five glasses out of a bottle, which has a bit more than 25 ounces in it. But some restaurants give six-ounce pours (perhaps priced accordingly) and figure on four glasses per bottle, with an ounce or so of “angel share” left over. That’s what Robert Bohr, the sommelier at Cru, called the excess amount that somehow disappears, as if it just evaporates, as if unseen forces consume it.

I called Robert because Cru inhabits the spot that Washington Park did; because Cru has one of the most extensive wine lists in the city; because I observed in my visits to Cru that Robert is an intelligent and kind guy; and because when I turned to my electronic Rolodex, I spotted his number before those of any other sommeliers in town.

Robert told me that the six-ounce pours at Cru aren’t just a matter of generosity. They’re a matter of arithmetical neatness. Cru, like more and more restaurants in New York, permits diners to have three-ounce tastes instead of full glasses of many wines. If those three-ounce tastes kept company with five-ounce glasses, well, the 24 or 25 divisible ounces in the bottle might not get divided all that cleanly. Toward the end of a bottle, you might have two ounces, which wouldn’t be enough for a taste, or four ounces, which wouldn’t be enough for a glass.

I don’t know how this turned into a second-grade math class, but it did. And I apologize.

Where was I? Oh, wine pours.

I had a good one at Bouchon, definitely more than five ounces, and the wine, by the way, was a Fenouillet Cotes du Ventoux rosé, for $5 a glass or $13 a carafe. (Sadly, it’s off the list now — it was a delightful wine.)

I also had a good pour at Parea, a new Greek restaurant in the Flatiron district. But I received less voluminous bequests from two other new restaurants, Megu Midtown, which is near the United Nations, and Degustation, which is in the East Village.

At Megu Midtown I also encountered another of my wine-related frustrations: the attempt to remove a glass of wine that still had a full sip in it.

This happens all the time. And if, by chance, you’re having a meal of paired food and wine, during which the restaurant is serving you many glasses of many different kinds of wine, and if the food about to come is not the food that goes with the wine you’ve almost finished, then the hasty removal is not such a bad thing.

But if you’re going to be ordering another glass, and you now need that new glass sooner because the old glass is gone, the hasty removal isn’t optimal. I don’t think it’s an insidious attempt to pump up the bill. Too many almost-empty glasses would have to be removed too hastily for the series of gestures to equal one more glass of wine than you would otherwise have ordered.

But I do think it’s sloppy and inconsiderate.

Neither of those adjectives applies to Bouchon, which I liked more than I had expected to. My colleague Peter Meehan, in reviewing the restaurant recently in the Times, rightly noted that it’s an experience shaped entirely by expectations.

If you go there all Thomas Keller-gaga, expecting Per Se on the cheap, you’re going to be bummed. If you go there for a quick and casual bite in a mall with a view, you’re going to be pleased, at least if you don’t mind dropping a bit of cash.

Sandwiches range from $9.75 (cashew butter and apricot jam) to $13.25 (roast beef and melted fontina). The quiche du jour is $10.75. But that got us a hefty, insanely rich wedge of quiche Florentine.

We liked our chilled cantaloupe and peekytoe crab soup, and we loved Bouchon’s haute spin on a Nutter Butter cookie, maybe because we love Nutter Butter cookies, period. This one was big enough for two — a good thing, because it costs $5.75.

But what I enjoyed more than anything else was how civilized Bouchon felt — how incredibly cosmopolitan and indulgent it felt to sit in an analogue to a food court and not be eating a hot dog or downing a milkshake.

Yes, there’s this monstrously large Samsung sign smack over your head, so close that you fear it might fall and crush you. But once you’ve made peace with that possibility, you can glance out the glass facade of the Time Warner Center and appraise Columbus Circle, which — in case you haven’t noticed — now looks pretty fantastic. It’s a bona fide urban oasis, ringed by purple flowers.

The sense of light and space around you as you sit at Bouchon, which is on the center’s third floor, is really something. The mall in general and the restaurant in particular seem to draw a disproportionate number of foreign tourists, so you can listen to the various accents and languages and feel tres, or mucho, or molto global.

And, as you do, you can sip decent wines. In fashionable glasses. Filled with generous pours.
