To the Editor:

Republican discomfort over David E. Duke's Congressional candidacy (news article, April 29) cannot be explained solely by the fact that he has aligned himself with the Republican Party and that many of his positions are widely accepted in the party.

Although the Republican National Committee and leading national Republicans have disavowed Mr. Duke, his racism and his anti-Semitism, the Republican Governor of Louisiana, Mike Foster, has repeatedly refused to criticize him, remarking that several Republican candidates in the open primary are friends.

So long as a Republican as prominent as Mr. Foster can accept Mr. Duke's candidacy, Republicans everywhere must accept the risk that they will be identified with Mr. Duke's obscene views.
