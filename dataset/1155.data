WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — There’s something very meta about a crossword puzzle where the entry that reveals the theme to you is the answer [CROSS]WORDS. And yet, that’s exactly what happened to me during this very enjoyable solve.

Paula Gamache is back, and she seems to be feeling “out of sorts”; CROSS, even. Let’s see if we can cheer her up.

Ms. Gamache’s offering is a Scrabbly, twisty puzzle where the theme entries are a variety of words that can have the word CROSS added to them to make something different. We also have a welcome CROSS payoff at 38 Across, and I liked the fact that another starred entry (BOW) crosses the word CROSS right in the middle. It would be tough not to get Ms. Gamache’s intent here.

Another thing that made this puzzle enjoyable for me was the amount of fresh material, and each one is a very lively, “real word” entry (in some grids with more extensive wordplay, theme entries will register as “new” simply because they are not real words or phrases that would otherwise make sense to put in a puzzle.) We have MR. ZIP and MR. PINK, the lovely SEAHORSES, as well as THIRD CLASS and the wonderful BUYS TIME.

“Jewish wedding rings?” is a very funny clue for anyone who has ever tried to make a decent circle while dancing the HORA (actually plural in the puzzle.)

So I hope you feel better, Ms. Gamache. No need to be CROSS. In my opinion, this was a lovely midweek grid.

In fact, I wanted to play the video “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life” from “Monty Python’s Life of Brian,” but there’s the matter of that one non-standards-meeting word, and I couldn’t find a clean version. But you can just hum it to yourself if you like.
