The Clinton Administration has approved another visa for Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, and has invited him to a high-level meeting at the White House next week, Administration officials said today.

The meeting with Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, will mark the first time that Mr. Adams has been received in the White House. The officials said it was scheduled in recognition of the role the Sinn Fein leader has played recently in preserving the peace in Northern Ireland.

Mr. Adams made his first visit to the United States last spring. The second, on a multiple-entry visa that will allow him to enter the United States repeatedly through the next 90 days, has been approved on the condition that he does not raise money for the Irish Republican Army, a condition attached in response to British sensitivites about the visit.

Because of his association with the I.R.A., which the United States still labels a terrorist group, Mr. Adams had been barred from this country throughout his political career. But his standing with Washington soared as he helped to propel the I.R.A. toward the cease-fire declaration last September that has so far stilled fighting in Northern Ireland.
