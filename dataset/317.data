Players from other countries followed the U.S.A. Hockey negotiations closely. Janine Weber, a member of the Austrian national team, said many European women’s players shared news of the boycott on Facebook.

“I think it’s something we can all relate to and something we hope to accomplish one day in terms of equal support from our federations,” Weber wrote in an email, adding that more investment would help close the performance gap between the United States and Canada and the rest of the world in women’s hockey.

Jongah Park, a forward on South Korea’s national team, said that even though women’s hockey was a relatively new sport in her country, her team had begun to think about the importance of expanding the game to the point where resources for both genders were equal.

“Even we have desire to fight for equal wages and gender equality,” Park wrote in an email during the United States team’s boycott. “I don’t know how to do that. But always think of equalities.”

American players hope their stance will ultimately assist women’s hockey programs across the world, but they first are focused on increasing diversity in U.S.A. Hockey’s leadership.

Currently, only 15 of 91 voting members of its board of directors are women. It is the only national governing body among American Winter Olympic sports with a board that has less than 20 percent women. According to U.S.A. Hockey’s annual guide, the terms of 29 board members end this year.

The importance of having strong voices on the board was clear in the contract negotiations.

Meghan Duggan, the national team captain, is a player representative on the board. To avoid a conflict of interest, she did not vote, but she remained involved in negotiations throughout, acting as a channel for the concerns of her 22 teammates.
