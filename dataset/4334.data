It wasn't supposed to be a contest, but "A Keyboard Summit," a convocation of acoustic jazz pianists and electric organists at Town Hall on Wednesday evening, felt like a competition to discover which keyboard is the more legitimate jazz instrument. The JVC Jazz Festival concert gave preferential billing to the organ by featuring it in the second half, but when it came to making music of emotional substance and formal elegance, the piano won hands down.

Each part of the evening brought together musicians with strong generational and regional ties. Roland Hanna and Barry Harris, who were featured in the piano segment, are both in their 60's and come from Detroit. Shirley Scott and Jimmy McGriff, the organists who dominated the second part, are in their late 50's and were born in Philadelphia.

Mr. Hanna and Mr. Harris share a far-sighted vision of the jazz piano that encompasses be-bop, traditional blues and more romantic European influences. Mr. Hanna, the more lyrically inclined of the two, opened the evening with an ornate Gershwin esque fantasia built around the song "Yesterdays." Mr. Harris's solos were more playful and included a slowed-up, dreamy interpretation of the theme song from "I Love Lucy."

Sitting face to face and playing duets on matching nine-foot grand pianos, the two pianists found a rapport so natural that it was often impossible to determine where one left off and the other began. Their collaboration culminated in a blues improvisation in which both musicians stressed their pianos' middle range.
