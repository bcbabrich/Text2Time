''They moved out to the sticks,

May as well be in heaven.''

I note the sunset in the west.

He says: ''This road is going east.''

Yes dear, I say, you know what's best,

But the sun does set in the west.

Dear Diary:

The other afternoon we encountered a young, harried yuppyish matron in the mailroom of our East Side apartment house. As she fumbled for her mailbox key, she kept muttering a litany of complaints to herself, ranging from an absent nanny to her husband's shirts, a thoughtless business partner and a missed yoga class. A tiny infant slept peacefully at her breast, cradled in a sling.

She left the mailroom and in the lobby claimed a double carriage in which sat two angelic little girls -- twins, about 2. In the elevator, with the buttons pushed, I asked if they were identical. The harried mother looked at me. ''We don't know yet,'' she said in a flip tone. ''We haven't had time to check, we haven't time to do anything. But don't bother to tell me how cute or adorable they are unless you're willing to take them off my hands for the weekend.'' Alan Mount

Buck Glenn was waiting in line to buy stamps at a West Village post office. The woman in front of him was accompanied by her daughter, perhaps 3 years old. The child was playing with the postage forms and envelopes. ''Come here,'' the mother said, and the girl ran to her, accidentally knocking over a pile of IRS tax forms. The child stared at the forms on the floor and then stomped on them. The mother simply said, ''Well done, dear.''

Dear Diary:

My mother's Cartier watch had stopped, and as it was a lovely day, she decided to walk to Cartier instead of taking a taxi. Her arthritic knee acted up, though, and as she tottered into the store she was badly in need of help. She went to the nearest counter and said, ''Young man, do you think you could find me two aspirin?'' Not a usual request at Cartier, I am sure, but he responded with alacrity and returned with the aspirin and a glass of water. She then went to the watch department, where they quickly repaired the timepiece, and she took a cab home.

''And so, my dear,'' she told me (I live in Tucson) ''if you're ever in New York and need an aspirin, just go to Cartier and ask.''

Joan Pursley thought she had heard every possible street request for money, but she got a new one during the last cold spell. As she got out of a cab at the Avenue of the Americas and 14th Street, she was approached by a man with a cup who said ''Can you help me? I'm trying to get to Hawaii.'' She usually hands out change, but she was so amused she gave him $1.
