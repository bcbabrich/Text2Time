The Live Earth India concert scheduled for Saturday in Mumbai has been canceled after last week’s deadly attacks on that city, The Guardian reported. The environmentally themed concert series, founded last year by the producer Kevin Wall and supported by former Vice President Al Gore, had planned a performance at Mumbai’s Andheri Sports Complex that would have featured rock and pop stars like Roger Waters and Will.i.am alongside Bollywood stars like Aishwarya Rai. But its promoters announced Monday that the sold-out event had been canceled, as concerns lingered after last week’s attacks, carried out by gunmen at hotels and other sites across Mumbai, raising questions about security and prompting some scheduled performers to call off their travel plans.
