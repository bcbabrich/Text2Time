Cirque du Soleil, citing creative differences, said it had made a late-in-the-game decision to replace one of the lead actors in its first Broadway show, the musical “Paramour.”

The company said it was replacing Bradley Dean, an actor who most recently appeared on Broadway in “Doctor Zhivago” and “The Last Ship,” with Jeremy Kushnier, whose Broadway credits include “Footloose,” “Jersey Boys” and “Jesus Christ Superstar.”

The timing is extraordinarily awkward — Mr. Dean performed the lead role of a movie producer at a press preview on Thursday. On Friday afternoon, Scott Zeiger, the head of Cirque’s new theatrical division, said he had decided to make the change.

“Bradley Dean is an extraordinary actor, and won the part for all the right reasons, but we all felt that the chemistry and dynamic on stage wasn’t what we were hoping it would be,” Mr. Zeiger said in a telephone interview. “We were looking for something slightly different from what we were getting, and it took watching it from start to finish to see that.”

Mr. Kushnier had initially auditioned for the role, but didn’t get it. He is now performing Off Broadway in “Shear Madness,” but will leave that production join the Cirque production, Mr. Zeiger said.

He said “Paramour,” which combines acrobatics with theatrical storytelling to depict a love triangle between the film producer, a writer, and an actress, would maintain its planned schedule, beginning previews on April 16 and opening on May 25 at the Lyric Theater.
