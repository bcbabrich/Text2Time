The News Corporation and Telecom Italia are expected to announce a deal today to acquire the Italian satellite television operation of Vivendi Universal for 470 million euros ($464 million) in cash, people close to the deal said yesterday.

The companies are expected to sign the agreement this morning and make an announcement later in the day, the people said. A News Corporation spokesman declined to comment.

The News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is expected to contribute 80 percent of the cash, and Telecom Italia, Italy's dominant telephone company, will contribute the remaining 20 percent, according to people close to the deal. The two companies will assume about 423 million euros in debt.

Vivendi, which is based in Paris and is Europe's biggest media company, is trying to sell assets to pare its debt. Early this summer, the News Corporation offered Vivendi about 1.5 billion euros for control of the Italian operation, called Telepi√π.
