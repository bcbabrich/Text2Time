Many large nonprofit organizations, such as universities, depend on receiving from donors securities that have appreciated in value; the donors in the past have gotten sizable tax write-offs. But under the new law, the appreciated portion of such gifts will be subject to alternative minimum tax treatment for the first time. The coalition estimated this provision alone will mean $1 billion less for nonprofit organizations.

Some wealthy donors have been fulfilling two- and three-year pledges ahead of schedule, according to Brian O'Connell, the coalition's president. Consequently, it will be much tougher to come near the same levels of giving in 1987 and 1988, he acknowledged. However, he also argued that although tax policies influence the size of gifts, donors will continue to give ''for all the right reasons.''

Traditionally, the time between Thanksgiving and New Year's is the busiest period for fund-raisers. In recent months, many buttressed their usual appeals by arguing the tax advantages of giving in 1986. Stanley S. Weithorn, a New York lawyer and tax adviser to both nonprofit groups and wealthy donors, also emphasized to clients that the old law applies to any gift mailed before midnight yesterday, even though it may be received by the beneficiary in 1987. 'The Most Generous Month'

''Columbia University is expecting December to be the most generous month in its history in terms of private donations,'' Norman S. Fink, deputy vice president for development and alumni relations, said recently. He estimated that $10 million in gifts would be received for December. The University began a five-year drive in 1982 to raise $500 million.

Yale University received more than $11 million in December, more than double the amount of money received from individuals during December 1985. Many of the gifts were appreciated securities, and reflected the donors' interest in acting before the Dec. 31 deadline, according to Sue Dorn, associate vice president for development.
