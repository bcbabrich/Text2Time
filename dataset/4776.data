Two gunmen walked into a small grocery store in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn last night, shot an employee to death and rifled the cash register before leaving, the police said.

The victim, identified by the police as a man in his 40's, was found at 9:30 P.M., lying on the floor of the store at 618 Flatbush Avenue. He was dead of two bullet wounds in his chest, the police said.

The apparently unprovoked slaying was the fourth in three separate robberies of small grocery stores in Brooklyn since Sunday. In all three, the gunmen fled with an undetermined amount of cash.

On Sunday, two men were shot to death and two others were seriously wounded in a grocery store in the Crown Heights section. At least two gunmen entered the store at 1259 St. John's Place about 10:20 P.M., announced a robbery and began shooting, the police said. They killed the owner and a customer and wounded an employee and another customer.
