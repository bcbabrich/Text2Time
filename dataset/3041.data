As a Trade Tower widow I was disgusted by ''American, Even With the Hyphen,'' [opinion, Nov. 24].

Despite his suspicious behavior, like sleeping in an office, carrying large bags of electronics, filming things at odd hours, and yes, looking Middle Eastern, the author complains he was stereotyped. And he says it was ''all because of the way I look,'' because the police did not come looking for his blond co-producer. But then, 3,000 of our people were not blown to bits by the Swedes. The dirty truth is that profiling makes every bit of sense.

Our police did no more than ask him for proof of identity. I wager he would have fared far worse if engaging in suspicious behavior in any Muslim country. The need for our security measures was brought on not by our collective hatred of foreigners, but by the vicious hatred of who we are by Muslim Arabs.

He writes that he had a friend who escaped Tower Two. Maybe if he had lost someone he loved, as I and my two sons did, he would understand reality a bit better. And I will add that on a recent plane trip to the West Coast, my 15 year old blue-eyed Nordic looking son was selected to be patted down and remove his shoes for inspection.

I find it outrageous that the author, a fifth-generation American, will be ''holding on more dearly to the hyphen'' in his American identity. If he considers living here to be so onerous, I invite him to leave.
