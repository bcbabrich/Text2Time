The flutist Paula Robison presided over a lively evening of Baroque chamber music in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Saturday evening. Her partners in the endeavor were Kenneth Cooper, harpsichordist; Martha Caplin and Carol Zeavin, violinists; Linda Moss, violist; Annabelle Hoffman, cellist, and Sara Thompson, bassist.

The setting played a distinct role in the performance. Apart from its visual stimulation, the Medieval Sculpture Hall is an exceptionally resonant space, and its reverberance lent a firmness to Miss Robison's tone, which can sound breathy in drier halls.

Miss Robison began with Jean-Jacques Rousseau's solo flute arrangement of ''Spring,'' from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons.'' An inventive version that uses alterations of registration and coloration to suggest the rest of the orchestra, it captures the spirit, if not quite the detail, of the original. In any case, it is impossible to prevent the inner ear from filling in the missing lines, and it served as a nice vehicle for Miss Robison's graceful virtuosity.

In two other Vivaldi concertos -''Il Gardellino'' and ''Con Sordini'' -and in Bach's Suite No. 2 in B minor, Miss Robison was accompanied by her full ensemble. Her solo lines were tastefully embellished and invariably played with spirit, and her ensemble faithfully matched her energy and her stylish approach to phrasing. The one movement that might have raised an eyebrow or two was the Badinerie of the Bach Suite, which was played at a perilous speed.
