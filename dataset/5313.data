Three Palestinian demonstrators died today as a result of gunshot wounds sustained in clashes with Israeli troops. It was the highest death toll in several weeks.

Two of the three were teen-agers. One died in a Tel Aviv hospital from a wound suffered during demonstrations on Tuesday.

The deaths occurred on the second day of a general strike across the West Bank and Gaza Strip called to protest Israel's recent decision to expel 25 Palestinians. During a general strike, all shops and businesses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip close for the day, and Palestinians generally stay off the roads. Cities in the occupied territories look deserted, except where demonstrations are occurring.

Palestinians said Khamis Almeenawi, 17 years old, of the Gaza Strip was shot and killed during violent demonstrations in Gaza this evening. Also this evening, Palestinians said, Ayman Achmed Najar, 16, died of a gunshot wound to the head suffered during demonstrations at the Rafah refugee center Tuesday.
