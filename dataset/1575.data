SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — We get only one themeless crossword this week, and it’s a fun one by Barry C. Silk. I found it easier than average for this constructor but with plenty of terrific answers.

My favorite clue is “Organization nickname that plays off the group’s secrecy.” Just look into this flashy thingy while I explain that the N.S.A. you thought you had heard of doesn’t even exit. The initials stand for NO SUCH AGENCY. Now go about your business. Experienced solvers know that when “organization” or “agency” is used in a clue, the answer usually goes the other direction to avoid repeating the word.

“Sense” is a good clue for GET A READ ON, although I had BEAD instead for a while. READ is better. Pledging one’s TROTH is usually done these days while wearing either a tuxedo or an elaborate white dress. It means “Loyalty.” “Awacs,” or as most of the world not constrained by the New York Times style guide calls it, AWACS, refers to the Airborne Warning and Control System.

“Producer of hits” for GOOGLE SEARCH seems like an odd clue. Page hits are a common metric for Web sites, but the hits are “produced” by Google only indirectly. Users click through on pages of search results. In a different sense, however, it’s literally true. The ranking Google gives your company for a specific search term can mean the difference between being a hit site and corporate death. The details of how Google decides search-results ranking are closely guarded trade secrets. Full disclosure: I also work for the company that created and operates Bing, a competing search service.

If you had trouble today, I’m going to guess it was near the bottom. “Worn” is THREADBARE and the “Senate cry” is HAIL CAESAR. Yes, that senate. The hefty South-American rodent is a CAPYBARA. Females are even larger than males, weighing in at up to 145 pounds. It reminded me of the untold Sherlock Holmes tale of The Giant Rat of Sumatra, which Dr. Watson warned us was “a story for which the world is not yet prepared.” If that isn’t scary enough, a “chimera” in Greek mythology was a creature assembled from various parts of a snake, a lion and a GOAT.

India.Arie has that unusual punctuation in the middle of her name but her voice is lovely. Have a listen:
