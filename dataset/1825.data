Lowen’s Pharmacy, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, closed early on Thursday evening for a wake for its owner, John Rossi. Mr. Rossi, whose store was under investigation in a wide-ranging steroid probe, was found dead in an office above the business on Monday with two apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Bay Ridge has been buzzing about his death all week.



The neighborhood, which stretches from 65th Street to 101st Street along Brooklyn’s eastern shoreline, is fairly big, geographically speaking. But, maybe because of its low-rise buildings and neat front yards, and maybe in part because it is hemmed in by expressways that clearly define its boundaries, Bay Ridge, where I went for this week’s Dispatches feature in the City section, can feel like a small town.

It certainly felt like one on Wednesday and Thursday on the sidewalks around Lowen’s, where almost every overheard conversation centered on Mr. Rossi. Customers traded opinions in line at the Family Store, a Mediterranean food shop across the street. Teenagers walking home from school stopped and pointed at the spot where the TV crew had been. A woman sitting on a bench in front of the diner down the block looked over at the pharmacy, shook her head and said, “I can’t believe they’re open already.”

A few different factors made the story the talk of the neighborhood. First, Mr. Rossi was, by all accounts, a personable, trustworthy fixture behind the pharmacy counter. And Bay Ridge is a neighborhood where a knowledgeable pharmacist is important: A stretch of the neighborhood a little to the south of Lowen’s has been called a NORC, a naturally occurring retirement community, with a high density of residents older than 60. Residents said this week that these people, especially, appreciated Mr. Rossi’s expertise, within walking distance.

The steroid investigation, which first came to Lowen’s with a raid in May, had also kept attention on the store for the better part of a year, amid reports that city police officers were among those accused of buying steroids there.

Also, one partner in the drugstore, The Daily News reported Thursday, was Julius Nasso, who attracts a fair amount of attention of his own. Mr. Nasso, who once worked at Lowen’s as a stock boy, later served time in federal prison for conspiring with mobsters to extort money from the actor Steven Seagal.

On Wednesday, The Daily News had a reporter stationed outside Lowen’s to see if Mr. Nasso would show up. He did not.

Finally, hushed gossip in the neighborhood focused on the circumstances of Mr. Rossi’s death, which the city medical examiner ruled a suicide. He reportedly was being sought to testify in the steroid inquiry, and people who have doubts about the official story say he had a lot to live for, and a lot of information that could have hurt others. They also focus on what killed him: two gunshots. Mr. Rossi was a pharmacist, after all, and, as his longtime customer Lorraine Daly, a rare neighbor who would express such sentiments on the record, put it, “If you had a choice, pills or a gun, what are you going to use?”

Mostly, regardless of the details, people just said they were shocked and saddened that someone they knew and cared about was gone. As one note, addressed to Mr. Rossi and taped to the front of the store, read: “I never told you how much I respected and liked you. I wish I had. But now I have. Rest in peace, see you in heaven.”
