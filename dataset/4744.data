Chartwell Associates, a limited partnership that includes the family trust of the oil heir Gordon P. Getty, said it would seek the proxy votes of shareholders of Avon Products Inc. in support of its slate of candidates to the cosmetic maker's board. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chartwell said it would propose candidates for four board openings.

Chartwell also disclosed it had increased its stake in Avon's common stock to 22.17 percent from 19.9 percent. The partnership has been wrangling with Avon since last year, when Chartwell started buying large blocks of Avon stock and sought seats on the board, contending the company was not run properly. Chartwell has spent a total of $449.7 million to acquire 12.5 million Avon shares.
