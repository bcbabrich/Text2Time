In the fashionable 16th arrondissement at the end of the Avenue Victor Hugo, just before it plunges into the Bois de Boulogne, is the Cafe Flandrin, once a railway station, now a cafe whose chairs and tables sprawl over the tree-lined sidewalk. And on the other side of town, near the Place de la Bastille, you might want to wander down to the Quai de la Rapee along the Canal St.-Martin to the sunny terrace overlooking the pleasure boat docks.

Cafes generally charge about $1.50 for coffee, $3.50 for citron presse and $2.50 for beer. For about $3 you can also get ham or cheese sandwiches on long slices of French bread or a kind of melted cheese and ham sandwich called a croque-monsieur. Art One museum that should be visited these days is the new Picasso Museum, near the Place des Vosges. It has been acclaimed here and abroad as something close to the perfect museum concept, an elegant old building skillfully and tastefully renovated with a complete survey of works by Picasso - along with a collection of paintings he owned by other artists. (Open from 9:45 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; closed Tuesday.) At the Grand Palais, the spring show, ending June 30, is an exhibition of Dutch paintings from Rembrandt to Vermeer. Also under way, and scheduled to last until the end of July, is a collection of 270 French sculptures from the second half of the 19th century. (Open from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.; except Tuesday.) On view across the street at the Petit Palais are 50 rare Renaissance tapestries owned by the city, (10 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; closed Monday.) You can see more sculpture at the vast Pompidou Center, Paris's major exhibition space, which is something of a piece of sculpture itself. Some 250 20th-century works, including pieces by Picasso, Gauguin, Brancusi, Giacometti, Man Ray, Jacobson and Oldenburg, will be on display there from July 3 to Oct. 13. (The Pompidou Center is open daily except Tuesday from noon to 10 P.M.; from 10 to 10 on weekends.) At the Museum of Modern Art on the Avenue du President Wilson, there is another modern art show, this one consisting of paintings by the neo-realist school, which was founded in Paris in 1960 as a reaction to the dominant vogue of abstact painting. The show, which continues through Sept. 7, contains works by Arman, Cesar, Christo, Yves Klein and others. (Open daily from 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. except Monday.) At the new museum dedicated to fashion, the Musee des Arts de la Mode et du Costume, in the northern wing of the Louvre Museum, the summer's major show, continuing through Oct. 26, is a retrospective of the designs of Yves Saint-Laurent, called ''28 Years of Creation.'' It includes some 220 dresses and several hundred drawings and sketches made by Saint-Laurent for theater and dance performances. (12:30 to 6:30 P.M.; Sunday, 11 to 5; closed Monday and Tuesday.) Admission to museums varies somewhat but is usually about $3, which is the price at the Pompidou Center. Music and Dance In the second half of this month and the first week of July, the Opera will put on an Italian production of ''Salammbo'' by Mussorgsky, directed by Iuri Liubimov. The price of tickets at the Opera range from $6 to as high as $70. A festival of Mozart operas, directed by Daniel Barenboim, is continuing through June 28 at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees, with performances of ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and ''Don Giovanni'' on the schedule.

Ballet alternates with opera at the Opera for much of the summer, and on 12 nights stretching from June 24 to July 19, the Opera Ballet will perform ''Don Quichotte,'' choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev. Then, in July, the Russian director Ghenadi Rojdestvensky of the Leningrad Opera will be in Paris to take charge of a new production of Mozart's ''Magic Flute.'' Tickets at the Opera, which range in price from $6 to $70, can sometimes be obtained at the box office an hour before the performance. Visitors who want to plan now can write to L'Opera de Paris, 8 Rue Scribe, 75009 Paris, indicating the performance they wish to attend and the dates preferred. Enclose a self-addressed letter with an international reply coupon and the Opera will confirm your tickets, which you pick up at the theater on the day of the performance.

Young and sometimes more experimental choreographers will be performing at the Theatre de la Ville on the Place du Chatelet. The Cullberg Ballet from Sweden is performing there the first half of this month; the Dance Theater of Wuppertal in West Germany will be there in the second half. A young ballet company directed by the French choreographer Karine Saporta is on the bill from June 11 to June 14. The Theatre de la Ville's seats run from $8 to 12. Prices at other theaters are slightly lower than in New York - from $15 to $35.

The annual Festival Ile de France, through July 13, includes numerous concerts at various auditoriums in Paris and in nearby chateaus, including the Vaux-le-Vicomte near Fontainebleau and at Vincennes, Breteuil and Sceaux. Information and tickets are available at the festival office at 15 Avenue Montaigne, near the Avenue des Champs-Elysees (telephone, 47.23.40.84). Hotels and Meals The restaurant that is the rage these days is Robuchon (formerly Jamin) at 32 Rue de Longchamp (47.27.12.27). The Michelin Guide gives it its highest rating, three stars, for such specialties as seasoned lobster with blades of crispy artichoke, duckling with pepper and codfish with French beans and soy sauce. Robuchon is closed on Saturday and Sunday and for the entire month of July. A meal costs from about $50 to $70 a person, without wine, and it's best to call at least several weeks in advance to get a reservation.
