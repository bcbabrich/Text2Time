Even as the report reached Mr. Dinkins, the Transit Authority was notified of the first of what is expected to be many lawsuits by injured passengers -- in this case a $15 million damage claim by a 23-year-old rider, Pamela Owens of Brooklyn, who said she had gone four hours without emergency treatment and had suffered permanent lung damage from smoke inhalation. Recommendations Made

In its recommendations, the report, which had been requested by the Mayor and was signed by First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, suggested that the Transit Authority directly and immediately notify the Police and Fire Departments and the Emergency Medical Services in future emergencies.

It also urged that the authority participate more fully in city planning for emergencies; suggested that E.M.S. crews receive training and breathing apparatus to enable them to go into smoky tunnels to treat patients sooner, and urged that the authority and the E.M.S. jointly arrange for buses to carry large amounts of oxygen to major emergencies.

"It's better to be safe than sorry," Mr. Dinkins said late yesterday as he released the report at a City Hall news conference. Transit Agency Takes Exception

Alan F. Kiepper, president of the Transit Authority, also appeared at the news conference and disputed the report's conclusion that miscues of communication by his agency were responsible for delaying and misdirecting the rescue efforts. He insisted there was no breakdown in communications.

"After having reviewed the transcripts of the communication that took place," he said, "what was communicated was the best information to our people that was available at the time. In my judgment, they gave the best information they had. I believe our personnel performed well."

Mr. Kiepper conceded that some communications could have been speeded, but he said: "It's easy to make judgments three days later about what could have been done. Keep in mind, our first concern was getting the passengers away from the source of the flames and smoke."
