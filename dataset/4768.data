Mr. Brown said in a recent interview that he had been eager to have the Annenberg show appear in Washington, although by 1989 he was fairly sure the bequest would go to the Met. He had made his pitch for the bequest in January 1988 when he wrote to Mr. Annenberg sketching out some ideas about how his collection might be presented in the National Gallery.

He emphasized the advantages of his museum as part of a complex of national museums with an encylopedic range, for having a large attendance and for the patriotic appeal of its being in the national capital.

Mr. Annenberg wrote back immediately saying it was "proper to advise" Mr. Brown that a delegation from the Met Museum would be visiting him in a few weeks. Since Mr. Brown heard no more on the subject he assumed that his rivals at the Met had sewed up the deal.

That was not quite the case. The director and trustees of the Met had been pointedly mentioning to Mr. Annenberg what their museum could do for his collection, and vice versa, for more than a decade. "There is a time to praise and a time to ask," said Philippe de Montebello, director of the Met, said recently of these early conversations. 'What's Going On Here?'

The time to ask was hastened by news of the traveling show.

"We knew about the show being in Philadelphia," William H. Luers, president of the Metropolitan said the other day, "but when we learned it was going to Los Angeles and Washington too, we said, 'What's going on here?' We knew we had to put together a plan."

Relations between Mr. Annenberg and the Met had reached a low point in 1977 when he withdrew an offer of $40 million to create a fine arts "communication center" at the museum after the proposal was criticized on both philosophical and practical grounds.
