To the Editor:

''Rally in Washington Is Said to Invigorate the Antiwar Movement'' (news article, Oct. 30) is an overdue recognition that tens of millions of Americans, perhaps a majority, are opposed to waging war against Iraq or any other state that has not attacked the United States; that a peace movement is growing by leaps and bounds; and that participants will not fade if there is an American pre-emptive strike.

A lot of senators and representatives are going to find out that they chose to ignore their mail and their constituents at their own political peril, and they had better quickly figure out how to backpedal.
