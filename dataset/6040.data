TRENTON, May 2—The State Commission of Investigation urged the State Senate today to strengthen further the casino gambling bill that was passed by the Assembly last Monday night.

The measure is now before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the commission, an independent investigative arm of the Legislature, appealed to all Senators to support additional safeguards “if your objective is to enact a statute that will provide the best public protection against the criminal and corruptive influences the casino industry admittedly attracts.”

Anticipating prompt action by the Senate and signature by Governor Byrne within the next several weeks, casino interests expect legalized gambling to be under way in Atlantic City by next spring.

The investigation commission was highly critical of the bill that was first reported out of the Assembly Committee on State Government, Federal and Interstate Relations and Veterans Affairs. Scores of amendments were added, however, before the measure passed the chamber by a vote of 48 to 20. Its supporters called it “the finest casino control bill in the world.”
