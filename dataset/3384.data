When he argues Gov. George W. Bush's case before the Supreme Court on Friday, Theodore B. Olson will be performing the latest assignment in the informal role he has come to play in Washington, that of the most trusted appellate litigator of the Republican establishment.

While Mr. Olson will be arguing on behalf of a man he contends is a president-to-be, Governor Bush is not his first presidential client.

He represented President Ronald Reagan in the investigation by an independent counsel into the Iran-contra affair, the secret White House effort to sell arms to Iran and use profits to finance the contra rebels in Nicaragua.

Mr. Olson's journey to prominence in the capital began when he was a protege of William French Smith, Mr. Reagan's first attorney general. Mr. Olson had worked with Mr. Smith at the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. When Mr. Smith came to Washington, he brought along to the Justice Department two of his favorite young assistants, Mr. Olson and Kenneth W. Starr. Mr. Olson has remained strong friends with Mr. Starr, until recently the Whitewater prosecutor.
