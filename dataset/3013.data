After an emotional five-week trial that reminded Parisians of this city's vulnerability to terrorism, a special French court has sentenced two members of Algeria's Armed Islamic Group to life imprisonment for their role in three bombings that killed eight people and wounded more than 200 others here in 1995.

The bombings, among eight such attacks around France in the summer and fall of 1995, were claimed by the Armed Islamic Group as reprisals for French support for Algeria's army-backed government. Six bombings occurred in Paris, the worst on July 25, when eight people were killed and 150 wounded in an explosion of a gas canister packed with nails and bolts on a Paris regional train at St.-Michel station.

On Tuesday evening, a seven-judge antiterrorist court convicted Boualem Bensaïd, 34, for placing a bomb in a trash bin near the Maison-Blanche Métro station on Oct. 16 and for complicity in both the St.-Michel bombing and another regional train bombing near the Musée d'Orsay Métro station on Oct. 17. Smaïn Ali Belkacem, 34, was convicted for planting the Musée d'Orsay train bomb. Both men had pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The trial, which was attended by scores of people who had been wounded in the attacks as well as by family members carrying photographs of the eight people killed in the St.-Michel bombing, served to revive memories of the fear that gripped Paris in the second half of 1995 until the police finally detained many of the alleged terrorists. One suspect, Khalid Kelkal, identified as a ringleader, was gunned down by the police near Lyon.
