When the Big East women's basketball tournament begins Saturday at Gampel Pavilion, the teams with the best records will be Connecticut (27-0 over all, 18-0 in the conference), Notre Dame (25-5, 17-1), Boston College (17-9, 13-5) and West Virginia (18-11, 11-7).

UConn, ranked first in the nation for the last 10 weeks, is the defending champion and appropriately seeded No. 1.

But why is Georgetown (16-10, 9-9) seeded second, while Notre Dame is third, Boston College fifth and West Virginia seventh?

It is especially aggravating for Boston College and West Virginia because they are among the 10 lowest-seeded teams and must play in Saturday's first round.
