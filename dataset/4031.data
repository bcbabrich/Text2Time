A senior immigration official in New Jersey accepted gifts ranging from Oriental rugs to roofing materials for falsifying documents that enabled aliens to enter the United States illegally, Federal authorities said yesterday.

Since 1988, the official, John F. Lonergan, has supervised 200 inspection and examination employees at Newark International Airport and at the agency's Newark office, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said.

An indictment handed up by a Federal grand jury in Newark accuses Mr. Lonergan, 49, of Belmar, N.J., of conspiring with a document broker -- someone who helps foreigners wend their way through the complex immigration process -- to make false statements on forms for allowing aliens living in the United States to re-enter the United States after traveling abroad. The documents were used by an unspecified number of aliens, including two Iraqi citizens living in Jordan, to gain entry to this country.

The document broker met with Mr. Lonergan at restaurants in Newark and provided him with gifts that included luxury items like a Hartmann briefcase and Mont Blanc pens as well as truck tires and cash for a vacation in Aruba, the indictment said.
