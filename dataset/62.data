If you think Cinco de Mayo commemorates Mexico’s independence from Spain, you’re not alone, but you’re also wrong. The holiday, which isn’t widely celebrated in Mexico, marks the country’s victory over France in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. No one expected Mexico to win, but win they did, and the people of Puebla, as well as many people north of the border, continue to celebrate the triumph every May 5. (If you’re wondering, Mexico’s Independence Day is celebrated on Sept. 16.)

Here are our best Cinco de Mayo recipes for your celebration, from appetizers to desserts.
