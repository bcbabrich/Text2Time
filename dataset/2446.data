"We consider that the advert is in danger of implying that the drink may bring sexual-social success, because the man in question looks quite attractive and desirable to the girls," the regulators said. "If the man was clearly unattractive, we think that this implication would be removed."

Lambrini first ran afoul of the authority with ads featuring provocative wordplay. Since then, the watchdog group has required Lambrini, which is owned by Halewood International, to run its proposed ads past its "copy advice" team before publication. That service is available to all advertisers on a voluntary basis, but the authority decided that Lambrini's history of flouting the spirit of its rules justified mandatory vetting.

Halewood complained that the regulators were overstepping their bounds. "The watchdog makes some very understandable rulings to encourage sensible drinking, but we're not sure they're qualified to decide for the nation who's sexy and who's not," John Halewood, the company's owner, told British newspapers. "Beauty is, after all, in the eye of the beholder."

The standards organization, which is financed by the advertising industry, said its comments to Halewood were intended as confidential advice, since they were made during the preapproval process, and should not have been released to the press.

"We're not saying you can't have attractive people in adverts," said Matthew Wilson, a spokesman for the authority. "You just can't link alcohol to sexual success."
