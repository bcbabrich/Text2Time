‘NOT THAT JEWISH’ Monica Piper is a genial guide to her own life in this one-woman show, in which she touches humorously on her career as a stand-up comic, her failed marriage, her time as a writer and producer of the children’s show “Rugrats” and — most effectively — her decision to adopt a child as a single woman. Her casual relationship with Judaism is the framework, though you don’t need to be Jewish to enjoy the show. She’s too deliberately tear-jerky at times, but the piece has some very funny moments as well (1:25). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, notthatjewish.com. (Genzlinger)

★ ‘NOTES FROM THE FIELD’ Anna Deavere Smith’s wonderfully energizing new performance piece maps the cursed intersection of two American institutions, the school and the prison, in a racially divided nation. Assuming the identities of 19 individuals (most of whom she interviewed personally), Ms. Smith turns monologues into a vital, far-reaching dialogue among politicians and protesters, prisoners and schoolteachers (2:15).

‘ONE FUNNY MOTHER’ In this solo show, Dena Blizzard jokes about her children and her husband, but she never really makes her household anything other than generic. There are plenty of laughs but no overarching theme or point. It’s a show aimed at parents, especially young mothers, who want to foster the idea that raising children is an impossibly demanding task (1:30).

★ ‘OTHELLO: THE REMIX’ Incongruous as it may seem, giggles abound in this clever and exuberantly performed hip-hop musical version of Shakespeare’s tragedy about a Moorish general troubled by the green-eyed monster. The Q Brothers, known for a similar madcap mash-up, “The Bomb-itty of Errors,” once again mix pulsing beats and clever rhymes into the celebrated tale. You won’t weep, but you may leave with a smile on your face or a spring in your step (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, 212-239-6200, othellotheremix.com. (Isherwood)

‘PARTY PEOPLE’ This semi-documentary work, created by the spoken-word collective Universes, explores two 1960s radical groups, the Black Panther Party and the Young Lords Party. The storytelling is perhaps unfocused, and the structure muddled. But its investigation of civil disobedience and organized resistance feels heartbreakingly timely and intensely necessary (2:00).

‘THE PIGEON IN THE TAJ MAHAL’ A sweater-wearing, Elvis-quoting naïf (the sublime John Keating) and a sozzled bride-to-be spend a night in a rural Irish trailer park in Laoisa Sexton’s play. Ms. Sexton, who plays the bride, has written fine roles for actors, but the play itself spins its mobile-home wheels (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, 212-727-2737, irishrep.org.

★ ‘POISON’ This austere two-hander by the Dutch playwright Lot Vekemans begins coolly but becomes, ever so slowly, a tear-jerker as a man and a woman whose marriage did not survive the loss of their child come face to face for the first time in years. Each still bears a heavy weight of grief. Produced by Origin Theater Company (1:30). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com. (Laura Collins-Hughes)
