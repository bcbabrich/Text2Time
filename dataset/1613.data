Townies is a series about life in New York, and occasionally other cities.

In Hong Kong, where I lived until I was 14, most expat kids had more than one passport; spoke English, Cantonese (curse words were the gateway) and at least one romance language; and we could emulate several accents convincingly. We were well-designed for espionage.

So, when my father moved us from a skyscraper near the horse racing track in Hong Kong to a red brick house in San Antonio, I already had a taupe American cadence prepared that I’d borrowed from “Kate and Allie” reruns and a Virginia-born boyfriend. By the time Britain returned Hong Kong to China — three years after I’d left and 156 years after they’d taken it over — I had also acquired, when the occasion demanded it, a quiver of y’alls.

In suburban Texas, I switched on the television to watch the stringently polite ceremony called “the handover.” I was a half hour from fleeing the experimental independence of a one-bedroom apartment I paid $75 a month to share with five high school classmates, and heading back to my parents air-conditioned house 15 blocks away. My roommates nattered on about the soldiers’ trim, yarn-dyed outfits, boots and matching hats that did, admittedly, make the whole thing look like the reenactment of a battle between warring tribes of chauffeurs. Flags were solemnly lowered and folded, fireworks were shot into the air and 6.3 million people suddenly found themselves standing in a special administrative region instead of a crown colony.



I felt like my insides had been scooped out. But I mentally cauterized the dry socket behind my sternum, finished cramming tangled clothes and small appliances into my Honda Civic, waved, shut the car door and drove off.

Manhattan still reminds me of Hong Kong. And it’s not just the disparate population, spellbinding skyline and internationally recognized address.

I’m great at leaving. I am less talented at getting left though I should be better given how much it’s happened. Hong Kong was a train station set to techno and social circles depended on the location of your father’s employ. You could never rely on having the same friends year in and out. You never knew when your own number was going to get called. How expats process upheaval is where we differ from immigrants. There is a tacit understanding among us that maudlin goodbyes are indulgent and uncalled for.

Hong Kong had a wildly diverse population of expatriates saying their unsentimental farewells. There were enough British, French, Germans and Americans that they all had their own primary and secondary schools. (I attended the English system with Korean school on Saturdays.) But the schools were not as balkanized as you’d expect. Not with such an efficient, latchkey-kid-friendly public transportation system. Not when the legal drinking age of 18 was more suggestion than law and most of us, by age 10 or 11, had experimented with inexpensive, caustic rice wine mixed with sugary juice drink. Not when whole nightclubs were dominated by 13-year-olds trying to befriend 16-year-olds from across town. A successful night was judged by how many upperclassmen greeted you or hated your guts the following Monday. Both responses were regarded positively.

We were emboldened by props that are only viewed as grown-up by children, like Marlboro 100’s and near-neon, triple-shot tequila sunrises in skinny glasses with black straws. We also had a thing for four-star hotel restaurants and were rarely booted from dining rooms despite brazenly filching canapés and plucking medium-rare medallions from lavish buffets with panoramic backdrops. To better blend in while filling our bellies, we’d frequently strike up conversations with lone international travelers. Like an anthropologist, I enjoyed hoarding the stories and idioms of these exotic strangers, and the memories of their shoes.

Now in New York, when people skip states, disappear into marriages and young families, or simply get pruned along the way, it can be difficult for me to feel anything beyond a distracted curiosity. Maybe the detachment is useful. Perhaps it only seems like a bad thing. Like holding the single allele of sickle-cell anemia that ends up heightening a resistance to malaria. All I know is that a force field makes navigation in a frenetic New York easier. As does the ability to cold read anyone you meet along the way, then shape-shift your accent, cadence, syntax and semantics to best suit them.

Manhattan, after eight years here, still reminds me of Hong Kong. There are parts of Chinatown that are the spit and image of streets in Wan Chai and I am held in thrall by the Chrysler building as much as I was by I.M. Pei’s Bank of China Tower. But in the consolation facsimile I had first sought for superficial reasons — the dense, disparate population, spellbinding skyline, internationally recognized address — I hadn’t considered the implication of the city’s pace or the composition of its inhabitants. I fit in. It’s not just that the ingrained muscle memory for social navigation and a hearty tolerance for alcohol acquired in Hong Kong turned out to be felicitous traits in New York. It’s that here sometimes I get to sound like myself.

At a friend’s recent dinner party, I met a British man who was born in Hong Kong and now lives in the West Village. He is the publisher and editor of a hardcover travel and food magazine and I immediately recognized the ease, the voracity, with which he navigated Asia and Europe as something familiar, that special expat birthright. We knew many of the same people both here and in Hong Kong but had somehow always missed one other. We exasperated our host and alienated other guests by competitively peppering each other with Cantonese slang from the early ’90s. With him, I did not modulate the corners of my consonants. Words clattered out at a clip that could not be checked for quality or calculation.

In New York, I find I am less watchful, less greedy, less restless. Besides, I have finally acquired a handful of friends that I do not hold at arm’s length to analyze. And with them, I do not secrete every meaningful thought away in the apothecary drawers in my brain. They ask me questions and I respond with answers, not decoys or digressions. With them, too, especially when I’m angry or excited, my language is unguarded. I am suddenly “chuffed” instead of proud, “skint” in place of broke, eat “crisps” and an “aiyah” may make an appearance to indicate alarm. They rib me about my guilelessly disclosed peripatetic hodgepodge, my squirmy diphthongs and strange argot. But I am grateful that they get through my force field. I even tell them so.
