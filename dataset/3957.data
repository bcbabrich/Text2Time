Over Democrats' objections, a bill that would extend the state's authority to house its prisoners in county jails was approved yesterday by the Assembly. Joseph V. Doria Jr., the Assembly minority leader, said the bill is unfair to counties because the state does not pay the full cost of incarcerating its inmates.

Of the 27,000 state inmates, 4,500 are in county jails, and the number is growing, said Chuck Leitgeib, a spokesman for the Assembly's Republican majority. In separate action yesterday, the Assembly passed a bill to give Camden County $5.9 million to build a 200-bed addition to its jail.
