Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider the value of a photograph and the opportunities for perfect pictures.

2. Examine the propaganda used to announce the United States’ reinstatement into UNESCO by reading and discussing “A Photo OP: O Say, Can You See the Eiffel Tower?”

3. In pairs, research the political, social and historical facts of an international photograph and examine the meanings conveyed by that image.

4. Individually, create an original image representing the emotions, meanings or issues discovered in the photograph they researched during class.

Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “A Photo Op: O Say, Can You See the Eiffel Tower?” (one per student)

-International sections of The New York Times or copies of photos printed from the online edition of the International section (//www.nytimes.com/world) or from On This Day in History ( //www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday)(enough for students to share)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “What is a ‘photo opportunity’? What does the phrase, ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’ mean?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers. As a class, discuss the difference between a posed and a candid photo. At what events are photographs usually staged? What types of people are often in posed photos? Why?

2. As a class, read and discuss “A Photo Op: O Say, Can You See the Eiffel Tower?,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why was Laura Bush in Paris?

b. What is the purpose of her five-day trip to Paris and Moscow?

c. For what does UNESCO stand?

d. What values did Mrs. Bush proclaim “will help defeat terror and lead to a better and safer world”?

e. Why did the Reagan administration decide to withdraw the United States from UNESCO in 1984?

f. How was the photo to include Mrs. Bush, the American flag and the Eiffel Tower staged?

g. What did French President Jacques Chirac do for his “photo opportunity”?

h. How much money must the United States pay to rejoin UNESCO?

3. Divide the class into pairs. Explain that each pair will be analyzing a photograph taken from the International section of the New York Times for its historical, political and social value. Using this information, students will then create scrapbooks of headlines and articles that explain the context for their photographs. [If students are to look at images online, direct them to the online edition of the International section (//www.nytimes.com/world) or from On This Day in History ( //www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday).]

Allow students five minutes to locate a photograph they would like to use for this assignment. Prior to conducting research to learn factual information about the photograph, allow groups five minutes to examine the image carefully and brainstorm answers to the following “Pre-Test” (written on the board):

–Is this a candid or posed shot? How can you tell?

–Where was it taken?

–When was it taken?

–What “message” does it convey?

If time allows, invite pairs to present their photographs and their initial assumptions about the image. (This part of the activity is optional.)

Next, ask students to research the facts underlying their photograph by having them answer the following questions:

–Is this a candid or posed shot?

–Where was it taken?

–When was it taken?

–Why was it taken?

–What is the meaning behind the photo?

–How might this photo be used today to illustrate a particular event, emotion, cause or struggle?

–Who might use this photo to promote a particular event, emotion, cause or struggle?

Encourage all students to take notes on the research gathered in class, as they will need it to complete their homework assignment. In a future class, allow students to present their photos and the facts as part of a larger discussion about propaganda and the role of photography.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students will create an original image that represents the same emotions, meanings or issues conveyed by the photograph they studied in class. They may compose (even stage), and then take, an actual photograph, or they may write “stage notes” and illustrate what they would include in a new photograph. Students should write a brief explanation of their new photograph that explains the emotions, meanings, or issues they are trying to convey, as well as the different subjects or props included in the photo.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Why is Mrs. Bush visiting Moscow next?

–Why does the United States want international support for its occupation of Iraq?

–Why are Mrs. Bush’s delegation members from Texas?

–What is the difference between propaganda and documentary? –What are some examples of propaganda that is helpful? What are some examples of propaganda that is injurious? How can you tell the difference?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, participation in class and pair discussions, thoughtful completion of pre-test and research, and creation or description of an updated photo illustrating the ideas of the photograph they researched during class.

Vocabulary:

boycott, dispel, unilateralist, propaganda, chronically, mismanaged, ramrod, mezzo-soprano, burnish, delegation, initiative, assessment, staunch

Extension Activities:

1. Create a scrapbook illustrating the propaganda of a movement or groups, such as the Nazi party (or National Socialist German’s Worker Party), the Soviet Union, an anti-drug campaign, the Palestinian Authority, Office of Homeland Security, etc. Include slogans, photos, illustrations or other materials that illustrate what the movement or group hopes to accomplish, and how this material qualifies as propaganda. Briefly describe the target audience, and include a statement about the purpose of this propaganda and your opinion of its aims.

2. Research the history of UNESCO. Write an article examining how and why it was founded, what programs it has developed, and what influence it has had on world history.

3. Write an essay that illustrates the concept of nepotism (or favoritism) and comments on the positive and negative effects of this practice. Use specific examples, preferably from current events or history, to prove your ideas.

4. Design a children’s book profiling Barbara Bush. Where is she from? What did she do prior to becoming the First Lady? What are her politics? What has she accomplished as First Lady?

5. Maintain your own photo journal for the school year. What types of pictures would you want to take to commemorate the year? What symbols, images, colors, people, etc. would you want to include in this journal?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History -Mrs. Bush described the relationship between France and the United States as “intimate and intense at the same time.” Create a timeline illustrating the modern political relationship between these two countries, including economic and political ties. Write a brief essay using your findings to support or refute Mrs. Bush’s statement describing the relationship between these two countries. -Create a chart comparing George Bush Senior’s first three years as president to the first three years of George W. Bush. What issues were in the forefront of both administrations? Be sure to examine major events, legislation, approval ratings and budget trends.

Economics- Create a pie chart illustrating the breakdown of UNESCO’s funding. According to the article, the total budget for 2003-2004 is $557 million, and the United States is paying $82 million. Begin your search at Unesco.org (www.unesco.org).

Geography- Create a map highlighting the countries that are members of UNESCO. Then, create a map key to illustrate sites that UNESCO has deemed historic landmarks or where UNESCO is running major programs.
