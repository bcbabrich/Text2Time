After my column Tuesday, about the poll showing that most U.S. troops in Iraq want out, I heard from a surprising number of troops. Apparently the column buzzed among them by email, and most of those I heard from said it sounded right to them. But they also reflected distinctions that were apparent in the poll itself.

The poll found, for example, that Army and Marine personnel were more gung-ho about the war, as were men. Guard personnel and women were less enthusiastic. Then here are some other comments…Michael from Seattle writes: “You must understand that the Bush government has utterly no intention of giving up those 13 or 14 or 16 bases. Of the three reasons for invading Iraq outlined by Ray McGovern last summer — O for oil, I for Israel and L for logistics — the most compelling is the last. ”

Ivan from Rancho Palos Verdes, CA writes: “Your prescription for a gradual pullout is totally off the mark. Allow me to assume you have not served in the military. So try some empathy. How would you like to be one of these troops left behind in a war the country has already admitted is unwinnable? No one wants to be the last man to die in a cause that has no cause. Rep. Murtha, who has served, understands this and prescribes immediate pullout.” A timetable isn’t exactly the same as a gradual pullout, though, Ivan. The main point of a timetable is to say everybody will be out by such-and-such a date.

Bill from Fort Lauderdale, FL writes: “You miss the obvious solution, the one that was ignored by the British almost a hundred years ago and the main reason for the problems in Iraqi, outside the obvious one – US occupation. The country needs to be split up. Kurds in the North, Shiite in the South and Sunni in the West. Set new boundaries, guarantee those boundaries, and provide the Sunni portion a level of financial and economic support for a period of years. The other two areas have an abundance of oil for sale and do not need the financial assistance. Then the cherry on the top is our ability to recognize the homeland of the homeless Muslim population, the Kurds. The Israeli’s were given a homeland after WWII and that has led to years of strife. The Kurds are just as deserving and have suffered years of oppression and survived a genocidal attempt. By giving them what they already have, recognizing them as a free and independent country, and guaranteeing their borders, we do for them what we did for the Israelis. That just might go a long way in making us look like the people we attempt to be, lovers and supporters of freedom and independence throughout the world. Muslims can apply.”

Sorry, Bill, but carving the country up would ensure wars and terrorism in the region, and what do you do with Baghdad, a mixed city? Maybe it’ll end up that way, but we should still try to hold the country together.

Alfredo from San Salvador, El Salvador writes: “Regarding the poll taken of nine hundred odd troops on whether they think we should remain or pull out of Iraq. I think that unless one knows the type of troops polled and the impartiality of the pollsters is guaranteed, the results of the poll are suspect. It’s one thing to ask a Marine grunt for his views and quite another to ask a rear echelon clerk. The former, who is dealing with the war up close and nasty, will, I wager, opt for accomplishing the mission. As far as the credibility of the polltakers. What is a John Zolby, the pollster, as you describe him? Where is this Le Moyne College? Why should we take them seriously? Because you use them as a source to support your views? I think not. I hope you keep writing your column. I enjoy getting pissed off early in the morning. It gets my day going.”

Alfredo, I’m happy to oblige.
