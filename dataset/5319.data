''In Dual-Faith Families Children Struggle for a Spiritual Home'' [ Home Section, Aug. 18 ] by Ari L. Goldman, touches three generations of our family: My Christian parents, myself as a converted Jew and my adult children.

As a Christian, I married a Jewish man and remained a Christian after my children's births. (I later converted to Judaism.) It took me many years of discussion, argument, tears and two children before this situation moved from impasse to resolution. In the end, I agreed to raise my children in the Jewish faith. Being a partner in an interfaith marriage is rarely simple or easy, and putting to rest the guilt I experienced at disappointing my parents was no exception.

I believe, however, that time has proven the approach right. While my children were raised in the Judaic tradition, the religious identity turned out to be less important than the fact that they have developed an assurance and integrity directly related to their self-recognition as Jews. I am certain their characters would have developed in much the same way had they been raised in a Christian home.

My experience in counseling many mixed-marriage couples has reinforced my belief in the need to provide children of such marriages with a sense of religious structure.
