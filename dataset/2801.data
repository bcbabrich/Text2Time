Federal officials said yesterday that they would hire a new contractor to run the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, which has been the target of a prolonged strike and safety complaints for nearly a year.

The decision was announced by Marc S. Hollander, the acting director of the research center, which is on an island off the North Fork of Long Island. His staff is revising the entire contract itself and expects to have a new operator by the end of this year, he said.

The decision was praised by two leading critics of the current contractor, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and the local congressman, Representative Timothy H. Bishop, both Democrats.

Union workers at the center went on strike almost a year ago, on Aug. 13. Attempts to settle broke down as the contractor, LB&B Associates of Columbia, Md., brought in replacement workers. The union and others have accused the management and the replacements of unsafe practices.
