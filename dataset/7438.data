The cigarette industry has taken a useful step forward in establishing an advertising code that would be self‐policed. The code is designed mainly to prevent the more extravagant blandishments of cigarette advertising from being directed at persons under 21 years of age.

The standards set forth in the code cover two aspects of cigarette claims that have been with us for a long time. The first would severely limit the “virility” theme. In point of fact, cigarette advertising copy featuring athletes has almost entirely disappeared in recent months.

The second aspect involves any “representation with respect to health.” This is really the heart of the code and a potential source of conflict. To pass judgments on health implications in the advertising of cigarettes will indeed be difficult for an administrator to determine.

But the cigarette manufacturers who have adopted this belated code give proof positive that they are willing to impose higher standards of advertising on themselves. In this respect the code deserves the approval of all who are concerned with the hazards of smoking.
