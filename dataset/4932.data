AS Communism recedes, longstanding ethnic rivalries remain to haunt Eastern Europe. The region is dotted with minorities, from the tiny population of Sorbs, a Slavic people, in East Germany to the Turks who make up 10 percent of the population of Bulgaria. Old hostilities are still being played out, like the rivalry of Hungarians and Romanians for ownership of Transylvania. In some cases, however, efforts are being made to heal old wounds, as President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia recently tried to do with conciliatory statements about the expulsion after World War II of 3.25 million ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland. Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia have never been homogeneous nations at all; rather, they are combinations of distinct groups trying to share the same country. In Czechoslovakia, ethnic differences were played down during the four decades of cold war, but in Bulgaria and Romania the rigid Communist regimes suppressed ethnic minorities as official policy. Now, with the lid lifted in Eastern Europe, the ancient divisions are being given free expression and have become more evident than at any time since World War II. The re-emergence poses a challenge for the post-Communist republics: Can they accommodate the rivalries, keep the peace and build democracy?

POLAND

In Poland there is fear that a unified Germany could one day revive a claim to former German lands. Poles were unsettled when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany hesitated about committing to the permanence of current borders. Germans expelled from Poland after World War II and their descendants are a vocal lobby in West Germany; the number of ethnic Germans on Polish land is uncertain.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA

Czechoslovakia was created after World War I as a homeland for Czechs and Slovaks, minorities in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Today the Slovaks retain fears of domination by the Czechs, who outnumber them 2 to 1 in the population of 15.5 million and inhabit the western provinces, Bohemia and Moravia. In the post-Communist order, the Slovaks seek a federation; Czechs favor a more centralized republic.

YUGOSLAVIA

The people who live within the borders of Yugoslavia agree on one thing: it is hard to find a Yugoslavian. They are Serbian, Croatian, Montenegrin, Macedonian, Bosnian, Slovenian or ethnic Albanian, and the mix is not happy. The unity achieved by Tito after World War II is under more and more strain, related to the efforts of Serbs, the oldest and largest group, to expand their role. Dozens of people have died this year in Kosovo, a province where ethnic Albanians have protested a Serbian effort to assert control; anger is also rising in Macedonia, Croatia and Slovenia.
