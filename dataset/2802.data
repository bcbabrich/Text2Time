OLD SPICE, seeking to wrestle the top spot in sales of men's deodorants and antiperspirants away from Right Guard, is hoping that adding a dose of celebrity to its image of studly self-sufficiency will do the trick.

Later this month, Procter & Gamble, the owner of the Old Spice brand, will introduce four versions of a new deodorant called Old Spice Red Zone. The target audience of Red Zone and its scents, like Glacial Falls and Aqua Reef: young men and teenage boys who have taken to grooming products more enthusiastically than their elders have. And Old Spice, which has used a celebrity spokesman only once before in its ads, has hired Brian Urlacher, the Chicago Bears linebacker, to be the face of the brand.

Procter & Gamble will spend $15 million on advertising for the new deodorant, which is comparable to Old Spice's expenditures last year on new products like Old Spice High Endurance Bar Soap.

The Red Zone deodorant is one of the newest entrants in the highly competitive men's personal grooming field. The category has widened in recent years to include body sprays, which are perfumed sprays for the underarms and the rest of the body like Unilever's Axe, Gillette's Right Guard Xtreme Sport Deodorant Body Spray and Old Spice High Endurance Body Spray.
