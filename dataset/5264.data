The Giants' demise last season began with health problems in the offensive line. Now, after the National Football League draft, the Giants face another problem with the offensive line -what to do with all those players.

When last season ended, the Giants had eight prime offensive linemen. Now, with Karl Nelson's projected return from illness and injury and with three high draft choices, they have 10 major candidates.

They ended last season with Brad Benson, William Roberts and Doug Riesenberg at tackle; Billy Ard, Chris Godfrey and Damian Johnson at guard and Bart Oates and Brian Johnston at center. Benson has retired and Johnston was not offered a new contract, so if the Giants keep only eight offensive linemen again, two jobs are open.

One seems destined for Nelson if he regains his strength after radiation treatment for Hodgkin's disease and his subsequent shoulder surgery. Barring injury, space must also be found for Eric Moore and John Elliott, the offensive tackles drafted on the first two rounds. And a spot may go to fifth-rounder David Houle, a tackle who will be tried at guard and center. In some cases, survival may depend on the ability to play another position on the line.
