The newspaper Nezivismaya Gazeta earlier this month printed a copy of the party budget asserting that the party, on paper, was approaching bankruptcy. It reported a sharp decline in dues, and a drop in profit at the publishing houses, even as profits from hard-currency tourist operations and other commercial enterprises were on the rise. Absence of Real-Estate Market

Last week, one man who might have been able to provide some information on party funds died. According to newspaper accounts, Nikolai Y. Kruchina, who headed the financial department at the Central Committee, jumped off his balcony, leaving two suicide notes, one personal and the other saying he was not guilty of anything.

The value fixed on the properties is also open to debate, officials said this week. Mr. Luzhkov noted that the valuations were made 15 to 20 years ago. He said that in the absence of a true real-estate market, it is probably impossible to calculate the value of Central Committee headquarters -- a warren of offices in an Art Nouveau building on Staraya Ploshad that was seized by the Bolsheviks soon after the 1917 revoilution.

Different figures have cropped up for the value of other properties. The party's publishing empire -- including a profitable enterprise that publishes classics like the works of Charles Dickens -- has been appraised at 3.4 billion rubles, while the fleet at the car park -- which besides the Volgas includes 140 trucks and several ambulances -- is said to be worth 42 million. The party's holiday homes, or dachas, and sanitoria, staffed with doctors and nurses, are valued at 97 million rubles.

The party's empire stretched far beyond its physical property. High-ranking members were entitled to a raft of services -- furniture and apartment repairs, medical care -- and privileges, including the chance to travel abroad and an opportunity, through the old-boy network that the Communist Party apparat had become, to put their children into prestige schools and universities. Exacting Task of Divvying

Divvying up the party's wealth promises to be an exacting task, particularly in Moscow, where the city and the Russian republic are already trying to come up with an equitable distribution formula.

Already, conflicting reports have surfaced about who will take over the luxurious Oktyabrskaya Hotel, recently built by the party on Dmitrova Street to the taste of its bosses, with a block-wide staircase and massive amounts of red carpeting. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the hotel will revert to the Russian Council of Ministers, while Mr. Luzhkov reported that the Moscow Mayor's office had agreed with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that the hotel, with its 210 rooms, would be theirs.
