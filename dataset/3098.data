To the Editor:

Re: ''Tons of Screens, Not Enough Viewers (March 11)'': It would be a shame to lose (Loews) Fairfield Community Theatre. Where else between Greenwich and New Haven can one see the unusual or provocative independent film? Or foreign films like France's Agn√®s Varda's ''Gleaners and I,'' or Senegal's Ousmane Sembene's ''Faat-Kine,'' or Iran's Tahmineh Milani's ''Two Women,'' all discussed in the pages of the Arts & Leisure section of The Times on March 11?

And where else can one walk out on a summer evening, having just seen ''Cinema Paradiso,'' and find moviegoers gathered on park benches in the heart of downtown Fairfield and feel like you've just walked into Cinema Paradiso.

What a loss it would be to the community to lose The Community!
