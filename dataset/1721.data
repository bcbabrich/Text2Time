The sun is out and the sky is (somewhat) blue for Day 2 of All Points West, but the fans are still stepping cautiously as they make their way through the front gates. Thanks to Friday’s rain, the grounds of Liberty State Park in Jersey City are a patchwork of muddy puddles and soggy grass, with only the occasional oasis of pavement or woodchips.

But by the time the crowd got to White Rabbits, a Brooklyn band that opened the main stage, they had gotten as acclimated to muddy calves as they were probably ever going to be, and settled into the usual rock-festival roles: fearless dancers up front, intra-stage browsers toward the back, and Hacky Sack-ers off the sides.

So far the crowds are thin for the second day, which features Tool, My Bloody Valentine, Gogol Bordello, Neko Case, Arctic Monkeys and lots more. But it’s early, and that schlep from the ferry takes a while.

Yet it’s not clear just how crowded it will get. Attendance figures haven’t been released yet, but none of the festival’s three days have sold out in advance. Last night the festival announced that tickets for Friday could be used for free admission Saturday or Sunday, a concession to the inclement weather on Friday. It’s also a way to help with one of any festival’s primary goals: to get lots and lots of people through the gate and onto the grass. Or, as the case may be, the mud.
