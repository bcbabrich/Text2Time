It is fair to say that roughly 99.9 percent of the technology and financial worlds’ attention on Wednesday afternoon was directed to Facebook’s first public prospectus.

But lost amid the hubbub was that another Internet-focused company, the antivirus software maker AVG Technologies, had priced its initial public offering the same afternoon. Unfortunately for AVG, its underwriters sold eight million shares at $16 each, at the bottom of its expected price range.

Of the shares being sold, four million were offered by the Dutch company and four million from AVG’s controlling shareholders, including Enterprise Investors, Intel’s venture capital fund and members of the management team.

The bookrunners for the offering happen to be the same ones leading Facebook’s I.P.O. and are listed in the same order: Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.
