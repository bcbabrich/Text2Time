Why India? Why does this distant, stiflingly crowded, quarrelsome country, still ridden with wrenching poverty for hundreds of millions and still unable to free itself of murder and hatred among castes and religions, mean so much to the United States - or why should it?

Why does it mean so much to me? Long ago I lived here as a correspondent; it was the center of my world. I have lived in other countries and while they remain in mind they become part of my past. Only India still seizes me so, emotionally and intellectually, so long afterward. I keep thinking about India, keep coming back, I and those other Americans who felt the pull of India and will for the rest of our lives.

For 30 years I have been trying to explain this to friends, and to myself. It seems a good time, the beginning of a new year, a time of re-examination, to return to India.

I came to find out what India was like, after four years of absence. Mostly, though, I wanted to figure out whether the idea that India was still important to my country and my life was just romanticism and sentimentality arising out of what India had been, and I had been, or had meaning.
