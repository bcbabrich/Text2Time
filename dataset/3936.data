To The Home Section:

What a paradox! On the front page of The Home Section on Jan. 11 there are two articles about housing. One is about megabucks residences made of marble that megabucks people choose not to live in ("Home Sweet Elsewhere"). The other is about minibucks residences made of recycled paper that minibucks people are grateful to live in ("Prayers Answered With Paper").

There's something sick about it all!
