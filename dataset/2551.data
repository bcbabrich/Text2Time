Speaking recently to a group of black evangelical ministers and lay people here, Genevieve Wood of the conservative Family Research Council made an impassioned plea. Black Christians, she said, must speak out against advocates of gay marriage.

''They are wrapping themselves in the flag of civil rights,'' said Ms. Wood, who is white, as visitors from across the country shook their heads in dismay. ''I can make arguments against that. But not nearly like you all can.''

As Ms. Wood has been brokering alliances to oppose gay marriage, Donna Payne, a board member with the National Black Justice Coalition, a black gay and lesbian organization formed to increase acceptance of gay rights among African-Americans, has been appealing to liberal black clergy members. Reaching out to potential supporters, like the Rev. Abena McCray of the Unity Fellowship Church in Washington, Ms. Payne argued that recognizing gay marriage was a matter of equal rights.

''We have to find ministers who will stand with us,'' Ms. Payne said, while going through her list of contacts. ''We have to at least try to bring some balance to the discussion.''
