Remarkably, even his association with Mussolini's Fascist regime from 1922 to 1943 seems not to have disturbed his tranquillity. In 1928, he wrote: ''I have had much faith in Fascism since its first inklings, faith that has never ebbed, not even in the darkest and most tumultuous moments.'' The regime and the reactionary Strapaese (literally ''supra-country'') movement in turn acclaimed his art as a reaffirmation of eternal values and a rejection of decadent internationalism. And yet once World War II was over, Morandi emerged unblemished, even winning the painting prize at the 1948 Venice Biennale.

The public recognition that followed did spread his renown beyond a small circle of collectors, and he even donated some paintings to public museums, including ''Still Life 1946'' to the Tate Gallery, to this day the only Morandi in the Tate's permanent collection. Yet even as he increased his pace of production, he remained ''a contemplative craftsman,'' as Matthew Gale, collections curator at the Tate, writes in a catalog essay.

''It takes me weeks to make up my mind which group of bottles will go well with a particular tablecloth,'' Morandi once said. ''Then it takes me weeks of thinking about the bottles themselves, and yet I often still go wrong with the spaces. Perhaps I work too fast.''

When it came to painting, he apparently did work quickly, as evidenced by his confident brush strokes. But the preparation was time-consuming. He stretched his own canvases, he made his own paint, he stripped bottles of their labels, he filled transparent vases with paint and then emptied them to create an opaque look, he painted other vases, and he allowed all the objects to accumulate dust. Sometimes he tested his compositions with pencil and paper, but more often he simply moved the objects around until he was satisfied. And when he was ready to work, he placed his easel just 18 inches from the objects. With landscapes, which he invariably viewed through a studio window, he found a different solution to the problem of composition. Since he could not move buildings, trees or hills, he used binoculars to frame the images that he wanted to capture.

Some critics have compared Morandi's geometric structures to chess games, both ''intellectual and strategic,'' as Charles Derwent wrote in The Independent of London. Others, like Waldemar Januszcak writing in The Sunday Times of London, see an ''intense and silent melancholy'' in his still lifes. Yet for an understanding of this artist's artist, perhaps artists should have the last word.

''I personally couldn't care less about a bunch of bottles, but I'm sure glad Morandi could,'' Mr. Close writes in the Tate's catalog. ''The formal invention, nuanced adjustments and surprisingly highly charged psychological content thrill me.'' Or as Sarah Jackson, an English architect, writes: ''In the Morandi paintings, some see bottles. I see cities. I explore boundaries. Morandi paints me a city that is mine.''

So the answer to the mystery, it seems, is to look beyond what he is painting.

''Jettison 'bottles' from your mind's eye and enjoy a tactile feast of what Morandi does with a single stroke of paint,'' Mr. Irwin invites. ''Wonder at how much happens when any one thing touches, crowds or intersects with another. Just kick back and enjoy the subtlety of his color and the nuances of his edges and surfaces. This is the incredible economy of means that marks the essence of a master painter of the real.''
