A BATTLE over trade between the United States and Western Europe was averted last week but the specter of a war was not banished. In a burst of telephone negotiations with Washington, European Community officials agreed to compensate American farmers for lost markets arising from import duties imposed when Spain joined the Common Market last year.

Aiming without saying so at France, an adamant defender of the Community's protectionist agricultural system, the Reagan Administration had threatened to slap prohibitive 200 percent duties on cheeses, brandy, white wines and other luxury items unless the United States was compensated for $400 million in lost sorghum and corn sales. Amid muttering by the French and others about highhanded American tactics, Community negotiators also agreed to lower tariffs on a score of industrial products as part of the compromise package.

The 11th-hour deal prevented a tit-for-tat cycle of protectionist measures that could have quickly spread beyond the relatively minor $400 million issue at hand. Both sides appreciated the larger stakes, which in ultimate terms had to do with world prosperity and the solidity of the Atlantic alliance. And, to an extent, both indulged in dramatic posturing and threats aimed at reassuring home constituencies that they were driving hard bargains. In the United States and France, this meant well-organized and highly disgruntled farm lobbies.

Last year saw a spate of such trade disputes, and 1987 will probably see more. The Americans and Europeans went to the mat last year over steel, citrus fruits and pasta. And looming are fights over the European airbus, which the United States contends is unfairly subsidized, and American access to the West European telecommunications market.
