Adam Fisher remembers walking home from elementary school thinking not about Mister Softee or Ms. Pac Man but about Ms. Grace, his third-grade teacher. Why, he wondered, had she explained a new math concept in such a roundabout way? If only she had laid it out like this, he recalls thinking, reworking the lesson in his head, then we would have understood it immediately.

This was not the first time Mr. Fisher had pondered the art of teaching and learning. In fact, he had been tutoring his classmates since the previous year, having discovered that he had a knack for explaining concepts so the other kids understood them.

A slender fellow with a goatee and a mass of curly hair, Mr. Fisher, 34, still tutors students. Only today his students are seeking higher test scores -- and his tutorials cost $375 to $425 an hour.

Mr. Fisher is among about 100 tutors working for Advantage Testing Inc., an Upper East Side test preparation firm. He joined nine years ago, with no formal teaching experience but a master's degree in music from Juilliard and a Harvard physics degree, and is now one of the firm's most senior tutors. He says he consistently raises SAT scores by more than 200 points and achieves similar results in graduate school exams.
