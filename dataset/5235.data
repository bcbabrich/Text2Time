Two young brothers died this morning when fire broke out in an apartment where they were left alone with a 12-month-old sister, the authorities said. The girl was seriously injured.

The brothers, Jerul Riley, 3 years old, and his brother, Ruel, 2, died at Beth Israel Hospital shortly after they were pulled from the burning apartment at 360 Leslie Street about 8:10 A.M., said a Newark Fire Department spokesman, Larry Krieger.

The boys' sister, Theresa, was taken by state police helicopter to University Hospital of Pennyslvania in Philadelphia, where Mr. Krieger said she was in critical condition with damage to her respiratory system.

The children's mother, Barbara Martin, 35, was driving their father, Rueben Riley, 37, to work when the fire started about 8 A.M., Mr. Krieger said.
