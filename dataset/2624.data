FEW Public Editor columns have attracted reader mail as intense as the comments provoked by my last two, ''Is The New York Times a Liberal Newspaper?'' (July 25) and ''When the Right to Know Confronts the Need to Know'' (July 11). Many of the messages were informed by experience both personal and professional, especially those concerning the latter piece, about an alleged case of sexual abuse.

In addition to the letters published here, readers might be interested in a particularly eloquent demurrer from Times reporter Nina Bernstein, which I've posted on my Web journal: www.nytimes.com/danielokrent, Posting 32.
