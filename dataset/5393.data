Jose W. Diokno, a former Senator who headed the Government's peace negotiating panel until his illness forced him to step down, died of cancer Friday, one day after his 65th birthday.

In his career Mr. Diokno also served as Justice Secretary and headed a presidential panel investigating human rights abuses. He resigned that post last month to protest the killings of 18 demonstrators near the presidential palace.

President Corazon C. Aquino declared 10 days of national mourning for Mr. Diokno, whom she called ''a giant of a man'' who ''braved the Marcos dictatorship with a dignified and eloquent courage our country will long remember.''
