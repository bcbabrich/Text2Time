To the Editor:

Having just returned from Ukraine, I found much to agree with in "Despite U.S. Hope and Help, Ukraine's Star Fades," your June 27 news article on the economic situation there.

While you might have given equal time to the more hopeful economic indicators -- sharp drops in inflation, the greater pace of privatization (of small and medium-size enterprises like Viktor Gumankov's factory in Zhitomir) and recent exchange-rate stabilization -- the main point is well taken: Ukraine's economy is a mess, and it will not improve significantly in the near future.

What I do take issue with is the imaginary reference point of a once rich and powerful Ukraine with which to evaluate the situation. Ukraine's unfortunate location at the intersection of more powerful empires has always served to blunt whatever plans its leaders had for economic and political development.

In this century alone, Ukraine's colonial status in the Soviet empire resulted in horrific famines, an economy distorted by a concentration of inefficient, defense-oriented industries and the ecological nightmare of Chernobyl, for which Ukraine continues to pay a high price.
