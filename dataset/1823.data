With an eye toward the next campaign season in New York City when top offices will be up for election, Ray Rivera finds that donations from the real estate industry, traditionally a dependable source of campaign contributions, have soared to three and four times the rate of previous election cycles as part of an effort to beat strict new limits. The surge is driven in large part by a major overhaul in the city’s campaign finance law, which, starting this month, will cap contributions from people who do business with the city at less than a tenth of what is now permissible. That means many developers, brokers, landlords and contractors will be limited to giving $400 to a mayoral candidate, compared with $4,950 now.



The Times examined contributions from executives and others affiliated with 25 of the city’s most prominent property management, brokerage and real estate development companies and found Councilwoman Melinda Katz, chairwoman of the powerful Land Use Committee, had received the largest amount in donations: $196,266 from the 25 companies.

Giuliani Down, but Maybe Not for Long

Rudolph W. Giuliani may have temporarily diminished his marketability, both as a $100,000-an-appearance public speaker and as a purveyor of corporate advice, after his presidential bid resulted in bruising news coverage of his personal and professional life and his campaign strategy was widely panned, Eric Lipton writes.

In addition, Giuliani Partners, which provides corporate consulting and security advice, clearly suffered during the campaign as his attention was focused elsewhere, according to former and current executives. Its client list declined, as did revenues, they said. The company has about 50 employees, down from roughly 60 a few months ago, and several pending departures involve people in ranking positions. But despite his poor showing in the campaign, Mr. Giuliani remains attractive to corporate clients looking for access to government officials in New York or Washington, particularly if Senator John McCain, whom Mr. Giuliani has endorsed, wins the presidency.

One person whose visibility was reinvigorated by the Giuliani campaign was the Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight, who became a fixture on the Giuliani campaign plane, in the Giuliani campaign bus and at Giuliani campaign events in the waning weeks of the failed bid.

Female Voters Make Their Case

Interviews with dozens of women across New York — a crucial part of the Democratic primary — show that many are bringing an intense, almost visceral connection to the election, according to an article by Anemona Hartocollis. How women vote will be critical in a state with one of the biggest delegate prizes on Super Tuesday, since they represent 55 percent of registered Democrats statewide and 60 percent in the city. A statewide poll released last week showed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ahead among all women, though black women strongly favored Senator Barack Obama. But black women were also more likely to be undecided than most other groups.

Principals Angry Over Sudden Budget Slashing

Principals across New York City discovered on Thursday morning that their budgets had been slashed overnight by sums ranging from $9,000 to $447,587, as a result of the city’s new tighter budget. They reacted with unvarnished fury, in part because the cuts come in the middle of the year, when they have already hired teachers, planned their schools’ schedules and promised their students and parents certain perks, like after-school programs. Many principals vented their anger in pointed e-mail messages.

The Giants Haven’t Played in New York Since Disco Was Popular

Clyde Haberman’s NYC column looks ahead at the showdown most immediately in New Yorker’ minds. No, not Super Tuesday: the Super Bowl. It turns out that Super Bowl bets placed between the mayors of Boston and New York City (as well as the governors of Massachusetts and New York) has irked the mayor of East Rutherford, N.J., where the Giants actually play. “Perhaps they have to check their G.P.S.’s,” Mayor James L. Cassella said. “Maybe it will tell them that East Rutherford is not in their state or their city.”
