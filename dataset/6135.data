TOKYO, Nov. 30‐A new Cabinet task sorce, working to meet a seven‐day deadline, began to draw up an extensive plan today to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus as the dollar continued to climb against the yen and the stock market here rose again in heavy trading.

Reflecting growing signs here that the Government is determined to tackle in earnest the urgent task of reducing the nation's mounting trade surplus a major cause of the recent sharp upward surge of the yen, the dollar jumped to 246 yen soon after the opening of trading.

Japanese banks rushed to buy dollars for importers who apparently believed that the American currency was bottoming out. The dollar's rise to 260 yen in the morning session was the sharpest climb in recent months.

The dollar later eased a bit to close the day at 244.20 yen compared with yesterday's close of 241.90 yen. Turnover today totaled $503 million, up $150 million from the previous day's volume.
