Senator Edward M. Kennedy will

provide two tickets to a Washington performance of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Art Buchwald will donate an autographed original manuscript of his ''Party Stoppers'' column of a few years back. These are two of more than 800 items to be offered to the highest bidders in the National Symphony Orchestra's annual Radiothon fund- raiser starting next Thursday night over station WGMS.

While donations by well-known personalities have proved popular in the past, the really hot items this year are likely to be five choice seats for Washington Redskins games.
