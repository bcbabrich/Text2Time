The ordinance now provides that, "whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object, appellation, characterization or graffiti, including but not limited to a burning cross or Nazi swastika, which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, religion or gender, commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

Local prosecutors used the law for the first time after the cross burning in the Joneses' yard to bring disorderly conduct charges against Robert A. Viktora, a 17-year-old high school dropout, and Arthur Miller 3d, then 18, whose father lives across the street from the Joneses. Causing 'Skinhead Trouble'

According to the prosecutors' account, the two young men, and four of their friends, were at the Miller house on the night of June 21, drinking and talking about causing some "skinhead trouble" and "burning some niggers," when they taped together two-foot-long cylinders from a broken chair to form a cross, wrapped it in terrycloth, took it into the Joneses' yard, doused it with paint thinner, lighted it, and ran back to the Miller house to hide.

Mr. Miller pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. But Mr. Viktora, who was charged both under the St. Paul hate-crime ordinance, and with assault in the fourth degree, challenged the ordinance as unconstitutional.

Mr. Viktora, who has been working at a nearby factory, has been reluctant to talk to the press: Whatever the Supreme Court decides about the St. Paul ordinance, he still must stand trial on the assault charge. Last week, after tentatively agreeing to be interviewed, Mr. Viktora failed to show up, leaving his lawyer to speak for him.

And what his lawyer, Edward J. Cleary, stresses is that it is not Mr. Viktora, or the cross burning, that is at issue in the Supreme Court case. 'It's the Law That's on Trial'

"There's no question that burning a cross on someone's lawn in the middle of the night is a crime, and there are plenty of criminal laws he could have been charged under that we wouldn't have challenged," said Mr. Cleary. "But in a country that values free speech, we should not have a law that says that expressing certain ideas, however offensive they may be, is in itself a crime. It's the law that's on trial before the Supreme Court, not my client."
