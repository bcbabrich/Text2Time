When he began his career as a senior analyst at General Motors in 1984, Fritz Henderson probably never dreamed that 25 years later, his name would be on the top of a court document describing how the giant automaker landed in bankruptcy protection.

In an affidavit filed in New York on Monday, Mr. Henderson, who became G.M.’s chief executive in March, laid out the factors that led G.M. into Chapter 11. The 98-page filing walks through a familiar litany of woes: foreign rivals with lower costs, a worldwide recession, a spike in fuel prices and a painful credit crisis.

In sum, Mr. Henderson says in the filing, G.M.’s only hope of avoiding liquidation is through the sale of the company to an entity backed by the United States government.

“There is no other sale, or even other potential purchasers, present or on the horizon,” the affidavit said.

G.M. took a number of steps to try to avoid arriving at this moment. It tried to make its cars more appealing to consumers and to get its legacy costs — largely related to employee and retiree benefits — under control.

When these failed to solve the problem, it considered merging with Chyrsler in the spring of 2007, and in the summer of 2008, it explored selling businesses like its Hummer brand and sought outside investors, the document said.

In the end, though, the credit crisis and a continued slide in its market share left G.M. with only one option, Mr. Henderson wrote.

He expressed confidence that the company would emerge from court protection as “an anchor for a new era of American automotive innovation and growth.”
