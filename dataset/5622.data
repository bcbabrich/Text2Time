Barbara Alvina Baxter, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Willard E. Baxter of Newark, Del., was married yesterday to Jonathan Marc Postman, a son of Dr. and Mrs. Neil Postman of Flushing, Queens. The Rev. David Kaplan, a Lutheran minister, officiated with Cantor Shelley Rakofsky at D'Ignazio's Nottingham (Pa.) Inn.

The bride, who will retain her name, is the keeper of coins at the Harvard University Art Museums. She and Mr. Postman are doctoral candidates in fine arts and astronomy, respectively, at Harvard. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Delaware, where her father is a professor of mathematics. Her mother, Alvina Baxter, is a finance officer for the Newark Housing Authority.

Mr. Postman, who is known as Marc, expects to become a postdoctoral fellow this month in the astronomy department at Princeton University. He is an alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His father is professor of communication arts and sciences at New York University and the author of several books of education and communications, including ''Amusing Ourselves to Death, Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,'' published last year by Elisabeth Sifton Books/Viking.
