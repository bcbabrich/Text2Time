There’s a scene in “A Walk in the Woods,” a low-impact amble through hill, dale and cinematic nostalgia, when our two crusty trekkers face down a pair of bears. The men — Robert Redford and Nick Nolte — are slumbering in their tents when the bears descend and begin tearing into the hikers’ food, which they have failed to properly stash. The bears roar and the men thunder back, flapping uvulas and arms to chase off the animals. It’s a mildly funny scene, partly because of its light physical comedy and sight gaggery, although also because Mr. Nolte, his signature growl now often at sepulchral depths, has been doing a fair impression of a wild beast for years.

That great untamed being emerges these days in Mr. Nolte’s lumbering, dominating physicality (he takes up space with personality and not just girth) and in the stubbornly insubordinate hair that insists on sneaking out from under his hat. Mostly, you see it the way that you’ve always seen it: in the unyielding, liberated spirit that can’t be tamped down either by age or by an easygoing, easy-viewing entertainment like “A Walk in the Woods.” That’s a relief, because while the movie involves a leisurely excursion on the Appalachian Trail, it nervously runs from anything that might lead it into uncharted, unsafe territory. Here, the cooked outpaces the raw from first mile to last.

The movie is based on Bill Bryson’s chuckle-out-loud, 1998 nonfiction chronicle about his own Appalachian tramp, which he started with an old friend, Stephen Katz (a pseudonymous character, played by Mr. Nolte) when they were both 44. It’s a story about men and friendship, buoyed by Mr. Bryson’s light self-amusement (he refers to his pre-walk years of “waddlesome sloth”) and smooth storytelling that encompasses bite-size histories, expansive lists, blue notes and zoological asides on loons, mountain lions and especially bears. It’s a pleasurable read and Mr. Bryson’s writing does what Ken Kwapis’s filmmaking can’t do, which is take you on the trail so that you too trudge, struggle and soar while observing flora and fauna and man’s inhumanity to each.
