To the Editor:

The proposed amendment to the Constitution making English the official language of the United States (''A Law to Learn 'Em a Thing or Two About the American Language,'' Week in Review, July 28) might just be of some positive use if it in turn receives certain emendments.

To wit: stating that the official tongue of the United States shall be good English and laying out certain dire punishments for misuse of the same.

In that way any politician or television commentator who dared to employ solecisms like ''gonna'' or ''it looks like it's . . .'' would be whisked off to durance vile.

We might also see a curtailment of that pervasive Celtic open ''O,'' which is becoming widespread and giving birth to such monstrosities as the rendering of the word for motor car so that it sounds like a Hapsburg archduke (Otto).
