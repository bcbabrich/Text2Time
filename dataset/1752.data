Two posts on “Sesame Street” in one week? No, we haven’t (completely) regressed to childhood — we just had to share this puppet parody of “Mad Men” that will be shown as part of the coming 40th anniversary season of “Sesame Street.”

In this clip, you won’t see Big Bird cast as Roger Sterling or Elmo as Pete Campbell, but you will learn valuable differences about the emotions of mad, sad and happy. (For the grownups in the room, there’s also a joke involving the word sycophants.) And you can be assured you won’t see anyone’s foot get run over with a lawnmower.

Watch the “Sesame Street” parody of “Mad Men”:
