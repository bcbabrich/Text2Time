To the Editor:

My "debate" at Fordham University with Michael F. Armstrong ("Feuding Lawyers Get a Hearing; Their Peers, an Earful," news article, Jan. 19) did, as your reporter correctly noted, turn into a credibility contest. It is often difficult to determine who is telling the truth in such a contest, but in this case it should be rather simple. Mr. Armstrong had told a reporter for Manhattan Inc. magazine that "one of the judges [ at a Second Circuit judicial conference ] had forbidden [ Dershowitz ] ever to return to his courtroom again. It was because of the way he behaved in the courtroom."

At our debate, Mr. Armstrong said that in fact two Federal judges had excluded me from their courtrooms (at first he claimed they were both in the audience, but when pressed, he backed away from that assertion).

Excluding a lawyer from a judge's courtroom is a very serious matter. Federal courts, being courts of record, require that all rulings must be a matter of written record. If I had ever been excluded from the courtroom by a New York Federal judge -- which I most certainly have not -- it would be a matter of written record.

I challenge Mr. Armstrong to produce the records of the two judges he claims excluded me because "of the way [ I ] behaved in [ their ] courtroom." He will not be able to, because the events that Mr. Armstrong said occurred never in fact took place. ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 21, 1991
