Mr. Miller looked back upon the campaign with satisfaction, commenting: “I can't really say that as of this moment I would have changed anything that I have done.”

At the outset, he said, the Republicans were placed on the defensive by Democratic allega­tions that Mr. Goldwater would risk nuclear war and abolish the Social Security and farm pro­grams, so they had to dedicate a “considerable amount of time to setting the record straight.”

But as the campaign has pro­gressed, he said, the Republicans have been able to take the in­itiative on such issues as for­eign policy fiscal responsibility, limited Federal government, and corruption.

Mr. Miller said the Republi­cans' most effective issue had been the Administration's for­eign policy, which throughout the campaign he has criticized as weak and vacillating. But he continued:

“Maybe the issue we are get­ting the most votes on is the issue of corruption in govern­ment, the breakdown of respect for law and order.”

As to why he had stepped up his attacks on Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, the Democratic Vice‐Presidential candidate, in the final week, Mr. Miller ex­plained that it was part of an “affirmative campaign” to show that the choice in Tues‐ day's election was “between private enterprise and social­ism.”

Stresses A.D.A. Affiliation

In statements and speeches in the last week, Mr. Miller has placed considerable empha­sis upon Mr. Humphrey's asso­ciation with the liberal Ameri­cans for Democratic Action and suggested that his oppo­nent had socialistic beliefs.

Mr. Miller found no basis for the criticism that the Repub­licans had failed to offer a definite program during the campaign. He said the Repub­licans had spelled out their ideas on such issues as Cuba, relations with allies and the So­viet Union, and military strength.
