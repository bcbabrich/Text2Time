Scott Turow, the author of the best-selling novel ''Presumed Innocent,'' has been strongly chastised by a Federal appeals court for his actions as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago in the early 1980's.

In a ruling dated Nov. 16 and stamped ''Do Not Publish,'' a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, found that Mr. Turow may have obstructed justice by using a criminal defense lawyer as an informant against his own client. At the end of the 13-page ruling, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, the judges ordered the case sent to the United States Attorney in Miami for possible action.

Ana T. Barnett, the Chief Assistant United States Attorney in Miami, said the Office of Public Integrity of the Department of Justice had been asked to review the case.

Mr. Turow, whose novel deals with a Midwest prosecutor who is falsely accused of murder, criticized the opinion of the appellate court as ''disgraceful and lacking legal or factual basis.'' Speaking from Chicago, where he is a lawyer with the firm of Sonnenschein Carlin Nath & Rosenthal, Mr. Turow said that he also had asked for a Justice Department review and that his actions had been approved by his superiors.
