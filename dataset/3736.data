Don King was selling yesterday, selling the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification fight on March 13, selling Madison Square Garden as the ''temple in the mecca of boxing,'' but mostly selling himself as a bejeweled Job set upon by evil forces who had kicked him around but didn't finish him off.

This is King's post-Mike Tyson period, so he must sell the Holyfield-Lewis fight with ferocity. He is not guaranteed a profit from the promotion, so he must cajole pay-per-view purchases above reasonable expectations to cash in.

''How are you going to sell two million buys? I predict for you two million buys,'' he bellowed yesterday from a dais on the Garden's arena floor. ''You say: 'What is this crazy guy saying? Is he out of his mind?' ''

Mind you, no fight has ever rung up two million pay-per-view purchases -- the closest was 1.89 million for the second Holyfield-Tyson bout -- and Holyfield's pay-per-view appeal has faltered when he has not faced Tyson, Riddick Bowe or George Foreman. Lewis's pay-per-view appeal is unproven, at best.
