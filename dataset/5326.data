Mr. Chaves was about to enter his junior year at William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City. He worked on weekends and during the summer with his father, Lope, an Ecuadorean immigrant who is an independent contractor installing doors and windows. Mr. Chaves does not have a criminal record and was described by neighbors as a quiet, respectful boy.

Mr. Woods testified that at the time of the slaying he was 5-foot-6 and weighed 145 pounds. He denied, under questioning by an assistant district attorney, James Quinn, that he ever told the police at his arrest that he was 165 pounds. Mr. Quinn had him remove the jacket of his three-piece suit to show a muscular upper body. Mr. Chaves said he has been weight lifting and is now 5-foot-9 and weighs 165 pounds.

Mr. Chaves testified he was standing with five friends when he saw about 10 youths approaching. They included Mr. Woods and a girl - the sister of another girl who had been slapped in a fracas with some youths and Mr. Chaves and some of his companions on Aug. 27. He testified that at least two of the approaching youths were carrying hockey sticks.

Mr. Chaves, who claimed he never struck a girl, said, ''This guy, David, jumped over the bushes.'' He recalled Mr. Woods saying, 'Who's the tough guy who hit the girl?' Before I knew it, he hit me.'' Another Punch in the Face

Mr. Chaves, speaking in a barely audible voice, put his head into his hands and began to cry. Justice Seymour Rotker, as he would several times, asked him if he could continue.

Mr. Chaves said that as he recovered from the punch to his face, he saw another youth approaching from his side with something in his hands, and Mr. Woods punched him the face again, he said.

Prosecution witnesses testified that Mr. Woods never hit Mr. Chaves, but defense witnesses said that he had.
