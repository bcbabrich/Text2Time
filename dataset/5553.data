The executives drew up a ''storybook'' - a page-by-page runthrough of which garment would appear on which page and what size child would wear it. Babies would come first, then toddlers, then pre-teens. ''The natural order of things,'' Mr. Freedman said.

Planning was so precise that, in some cases, even the pose of the child was determined in advance. ''There's a lot of superstition in this business,'' Mr. Wyker said. ''If an item has sold well displayed in a certain fashion -if a coat, for example, is shown open - then the catalogue company will insist that it be shown the same way the next time around.'' 'Personality and Looks'

Last week, dozens of models between 3 and 12 years of age were screened by representatives of Bright's Creek and Allied Graphic. There will be 64 shots of children wearing clothes in the 56-page catalogue, and between 35 and 40 models will be photographed. Those who were hired - at the general rate of about $60 an hour - had the right combination of ''animation, personality and looks,'' according to Richard Stastny, art director of the catalogue.

Also important is the right ethnic mix and the correct variety of heights. The cover, for example, will feature four children, and the Bright's Creek staff had hired Steven, 8-year-old Taina Mia Rivera and 11-year-old Alex Outhred when they realized they needed a blond girl, 46 inches tall, to complete the desired stepping-stone effect. They found just that in 5-year-old Martina Dance.

Many in the industry argue that the cover is the most important photo in a catalogue because the entire effort is wasted if a customer is not drawn to look inside. When Chadwick's of Boston, another Allied Graphic client, began its catalogue three years ago, the first few covers featured such well-known faces as Brooke Shields and Christie Brinkley, who commanded fees as high as $30,000.

On an afternoon last week, the four lesser-known and much younger models hired by Bright's Creek found themselves in front of the cameras of Bruce Plotkin in a studio near lower Fifth Avenue. Seeing Eye to Eye

In the world of catalogues, there are photographers who specialize in everything from food to heavy machinery. Mr. Plotkin specializes in photographing children, getting down on his knees so they see eye to eye, talking their language, making them laugh at just the right moment.
