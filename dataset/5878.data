Back where Wayne Radloff lived long before he enrolled at the University of Georgia, some of the people might have a difficult time understanding what he is doing this week.

There is usually silliness surrounding a championship football game in England, where Radloff spent the first 10 years of his life. But there, football is a sport played with a round ball and with no need for layer upon layer of protective equipment. And although a British football club's followers may overwhelm a city for a game, there are few invasions in the world that can compare to the one that travels from Georgia to New Orleans this time of year, in which grown men and women, otherwise respectable citizens, fill streets, restaurants and hotel lobbies with their cries:

Dawgs! Sic 'em! Woof-woof-woof-woof-woof! Radloff, the Georgia center and captain, and the only senior starter on the offensive line that helped Herschel Walker win the Heisman Trophy, spent nearly half his life in London and Ipswich as a child in a United States Air Force family.

H e will play against Penn State tonight in the Sugar Bowl game, with the nation's top ranking at stake. Radloff will play a game that may not seem very logical where he was born because the game requires that the linemen most necessary to helping the players that move the ball are rewarded with the worst view of the results of their effort.

''A lot of times,'' Radloff said, ''you can't see a thing, and the fans are screaming and Herschel's down in the end zone. You can't see it when Herschel breaks three or four tackles, especially in a pile. It's really probably a bad seat.''
