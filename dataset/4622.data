For Sabah Fakhri the concert he sang on Friday night at Town Hall was a short one, only two and a half hours long instead of five hours or more. But there was ample opportunity to savor the passion and subtleties of Mr. Fakhri's performance and of the classical Arab traditions he maintains. It was a concert of vividly expressive singing and protean interplay among Mr. Fakhri, a seven-man ensemble and three backup singers.

Mr. Fakhri was born in Aleppo, Syria, and has studied and performed music from across the Arab world; he has become one of the leading Arab classical singers. His specialty is the classical muwashshah, a Moorish-derived song based on Arabic poetry dealing with love and philosophical themes, from a centuries-old Andalusian tradition that continues in Aleppo and elsewhere.

Like other Arab classical music, it is a tradition of melody and rhythm without harmony. In Mr. Fakhri's ensemble, two violins, an oud, a qanun (zither) and a cello share and comment on the melodies, while the three-man chorus joins in or sings responses. A riq (tambourine) and tablah (hand drum), plus an occasional cello pizzicato, propel the rhythm. The music is guided by Mr. Fakhri's singing, which sets out the tunes and then rises above them in improvisatory curves and flourishes, sometimes in broad arcs, sometimes in tight trills and microtonal quavers. When he decides to move into a new section, the group responds to his subtlest gestures as if they were reading a written score.

The closest Western analogue might be gospel music, which stretches to accommodate the soloists' inspirations. But instead of vamping a pattern behind the singer as in gospel, the ensemble had to pick up full-length songs at a moment's notice.
