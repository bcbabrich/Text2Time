Several hundred leading figures from the government, business and nonprofit realms gathered at the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown today for a discussion about New York City’s future, organized by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy research organization.

The Manhattan Institute, which publishes a quarterly magazine called City Journal, wielded far more influence over the Giuliani administration than it has over the current mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, so today’s discussion — which began with a keynote address by the mayor — represented a bit of a rapprochement between the mayor and the institute.

But the conference also had an unusually laudatory tone. At one point, Mr. Bloomberg was compared to the pope who called the Second Vatican Council. At another point, a leading historian commented aloud — after Mr. Bloomberg had left the room — that Mr. Bloomberg might well be seen as the greatest mayor ever.



The moderator, Julia Vitullo-Martin, a senior fellow at the institute, set the favorable tone with her introductory remarks, recalling the turmoil of the 2001 election:

Many lifelong Democrats decided to vote for a man who they thought would have a calming influence on New York after 9/11, who could manage the city very well and who would be an excellent caretaker. In retrospect, this looks like the College of Cardinals in 1958, when they elected Angelo Roncalli, Pope John XXIII. Michael Bloomberg has been for us a revolutionary John XXIII. He has been a superb caretaker of the things in the city that were doing well. He’s built on Mayor Giuliani’s magnificent crime program.

Ms. Vitullo-Martin did not only gush. She noted that London began to intensify its competition with New York around 2003 and that Mayor Bloomberg had only 791 days left in his term.

Mr. Bloomberg gave a speech that focused on land use and the modernization of the city’s building and zoning codes, but he began with a joke: “No matter how exciting or challenging any other position might be, I plan to stay as mayor for the next 791 days and the Yankees are just going to have to look elsewheres for another third baseman.”

The mayor, in a conciliatory tone, said the Manhattan Institute had been particularly effective in the area of public safety “and got it exactly right when it argued that low crime was essential” to the city’s recovery.

The mayor turned somewhat boastful, as he often has in his major policy addresses. “Not only has the ungovernable city become governable again; we’ve reclaimed our title as the greatest city on earth,” he said. (Wallace S. Sayre and Herbert Kaufman famously described the city as “ungovernable” in a 1960 book, “Governing New York City.” More than 40 yearse later, “The Ungovernable City” was the title of Vincent J. Cannato’s 2001 biography of Mayor John V. Lindsay.)

Despite the mayor’s recent calls for fiscal belt-tightening, Mr. Bloomberg sounded an optimistic tone. “We may be headed for a national economic slowdown, but New York City has never been better prepared to weather one than we are right now,” the mayor said.

Mr. Bloomberg left the Republican Party earlier this year and declared himself an independent, but he sounded a message that resonated with his conservative hosts when he said that “we needed to completely rethink the regulations governing the way we use land in this city.”

He talked about modernizing the city’s building code, adopted in 1968, and zoning resolution, adopted in 1961, and streamlining the environmental reviews that accompany major projects — reviews that “can be lengthy, painful and expensive disincentives to development,” he said.

At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg maintained that his administration did not favor the “autocratic urban planning” of the Robert Moses era. Instead, he said, the city had involved various communities for strategic rezoning plans in neighborhoods like Jamaica, Queens. He predicted that Flushing and Long Island City in Queens, Downtown Brooklyn and West Chelsea in Manhattan would be the next big growth areas.

Mr. Bloomberg closed his address by saying of New York City: “It is going to get greater. Don’t listen to the naysayers.”

Next to speak was Kenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia University historian who edited The Encyclopedia of New York City. Professor Jackson walked through some of the most momentous dates in the city’s history: the English capture of New York in 1664, the adoption of the street grid system in 1811, the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, the opening of the Croton Aqueduct in 1842, the consolidation of greater New York in 1898, the enactment of the tenement house law of 1901, the start of the subway system in 1904, the adoption of comprehensive zoning in 1916, the building of Rockefeller Center in the 1920s and ’30s and the city’s rescue by the Municipal Assistance Corporation in the 1970s.

He said the “fundamental character” of New York could be boiled down to its diversity (dating from the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, where 18 languages were already spoken in the 1630s), its tradition of toleration (dating from the Flushing Remonstrance of 1657, which established a pattern of religious freedom), its density (approximately twice that of Chicago) and its “ability to change and face the future with confidence and hope.”

But Professor Jackson also urged the city not to get stuck in its past. “I would suggest that we are in competition with Tokyo and Shanghai and Beijing and Seoul and London to be the greatest city in the world — not with Boston or Philadelphia or Newport or Charleston to be the place with the most historic structures and the most gracious streets. As Mayor Bloomberg said, we need to plan for the decades to come. We need to be open to change.”

Provocatively, Professor Jackson speculated that three of the city’s mayors this century could be viewed as great — Fiorello H. La Guardia, Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani — but added, “It may not be too early to say that Mayor Bloomberg will one day be remembered as the greatest New York City has ever had.”

The other speakers were Amanda M. Burden, chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, and Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and investment bank who in the 1970s led the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the entity that helped rescue New York from its fiscal nadir.

Ms. Burden discussed plans for reshaping Flatbush Avenue, Coney Island, the South Bronx and other sections of the city. Mr. Rohatyn recalled the challenges of the ’70s, but also spoke of broader economic challenges today:

I think that competition is going to be fierce, because cities, which are almost countries, all over the world are becoming huge — producing creating enormous amounts of capital. They will be very competitive, with labor as cheap as it is. The influence of foreign capital is going to continue enormously, strongly, but the position of the city is going to depend to some extent on the ability of our national government to maintain the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. Because if we lose that position, some of these other positions may erode.

He said he did not expect that to happen, but worried about it nonetheless.
