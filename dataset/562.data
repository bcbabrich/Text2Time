SATURDAY PUZZLE — Have you ever traveled to a new town with no real plan for exploring and just meandered along the streets, taking in the sights as you go? I love doing that, because it’s the best way to stumble upon the hidden jewels that a town has to offer. That’s precisely how solving Sam Ezersky’s fine puzzle felt to me. I wandered around his grid, laughing and learning as I went, and that is the best possible outcome one can hope for on a Saturday.

We are a MOZZARELLA STICK-intensive household, so that’s where I got my toehold, and I counted myself lucky to gain entry into the puzzle at such an auspicious, central position. I crossed that almost immediately with TONY DANZA (how many boxers-turned-sitcom stars could there be?) and was off on my crossword adventure.

There was quite a bit of new stuff here, and even the entries that are not new felt fresh, or at least crunchy to me. I liked all the chatter in Mr. Ezersky’s grid: HOLD ON A SEC, AIN’T I, NO DOUBT, OH I FORGOT and NERTS. I liked having to look up HUPMOBILE so that I could bring this interesting line of cars (back) to your attention. I appreciated the beginnings of a cocktail at 36 Down (SKYY VODKA) and the BRAIN GAME at 1 Down. For those of me who have trouble staying awake for “Saturday Night Live,” here’s a short article on the recurring sketch “Les Jeunes de Paris.”

Let’s take a stroll through the clues, shall we? For dark humor, I liked “Notice after the expiration date?” for OBIT, and the Misdirection Award goes to “One doing 40+?” for FULL-TIMER. I could have lived without the abbreviated clue/entry pairing of “Size up?:Abbr.”/ENL., and I had a tough time getting from the vague “No wuss” to RAMBO at 12 Down, but there are always a few streets in our wanderings that we realize in hindsight it was better to avoid.

Let’s hear from Mr. Ezersky:

Constructor’s Notes:

From a constructor’s standpoint, it’s always interesting to look at a puzzle that you haven’t touched in seemingly forever. The one published today was constructed over two years ago, when I was in my novice stages of puzzlemaking … and as happy as I am with its acceptance and publication, I can see parts of the fill that I know I would have reworked, had I constructed this puzzle more recently. For instance, the top-right doesn’t feel like my normal work, with ELUL / VALS / ENL right next to each other, and nothing in the stack of 9s really sparkling. But hey, Will accepted this, so I must have done something right! The more fascinating part about looking at this puzzle now is noticing the development of clues over time. When I sent this puzzle in, I had SKYY VODKA clued as [Liquor with the slogan “Passion for perfection”]. Well, not only did another constructor debut this entry before me in a 2012 New York Times puzzle (grr!), but the slogan in the clue was updated to “West of Expected,” which I assume happened because the original one became outdated. Hence, as time flies, clue tweaks become necessary! Enough with my lamenting and scrutiny. What did I like about this puzzle? Well, I like MOZZARELLA STICK, my seed entry. I like BRAIN GAME (for which Will made a nice clue). And I like the way this puzzle “talks” to the solver, with “OH, I FORGOT” and “SAYS ME” and “HOLD ON A SEC.” Coming up with LIVE RADAR while constructing helped me out of a real bind in the bottom-right. Pleased with all the clue saves Will made for crosswordese-y bits. Most of all, I’m just grateful to be constructing for the Times, and I can promise many more puzzle in the future! Thank you all, and enjoy! P.S.: If you’re interested in solving more of my work, feel free to check out my “indie” blog, The Grid Kid. New puzzle every Monday with some zippy stuff!

And look where we’ve ended up at the end of our stroll: The SAVOY Ballroom, in New York City’s Harlem. Let’s swing on over to the Variety puzzle with this clip about the role The Savoy played in integration through music and dance.
