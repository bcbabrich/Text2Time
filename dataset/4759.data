The dissemination and popularization of the International Style was both impeded and redirected by the cataclysmic events of the Depression and World War II. The first created the need for inexpensive mass-produced furniture, the second developed the technology that would make such production possible, and profitable. The war also pushed many European designers to relocate in America, an essential factor in the postwar blossoming of American design.

But the story of postwar design is not all American, as this exhibition makes abundantly clear. One of the show's strengths is the broad representation of Scandinavian designers, for example. The big names are here: Aalto of Finland, Bruno Matthson of Sweden, Arne Jacobsen of Denmark (creator of the tiny-waisted three-legged "ant chair"). But so are nearly three dozen other furniture, fabric and ceramics designers from these countries whose achievements are not so familiar.

As this suggests, the exhibition has a particularly wonderful balance, in which old standbys alternate regularly with lesser-known achievements. This can happen in terms of an entire medium: textile designs are unusually prominent in nearly every section of the show and almost always add something new to the sense of the period's stylistic shifts. At the beginning there is Bernard Rudofsky's 1948-49 "Fractions" fabric, whose repeating patterns were worked out, it would seem, entirely at the typewriter; at the end, the delicately scaled Op Art-inspired geometries of Alexander Girard, an American designer who worked in the 1960's. In between, there are many other textile delights, some of them designed by the likes of Miro, Dali and Leger.

But the constant exchange between familiar and new information also operates on a more individual basis. For example, the storage unit that Ray and Charles Eames designed in 1949 -- with its bright Mondrianesque patchwork of colored panels and materials -- is famous. It can be seen on a fairly regular basis in museum displays, furniture dealers' windows or in those meticulous 50's interiors that crop up regularly in the home-design magazines. Nonetheless, it is illuminating to see the Montreal Museum's Eames storage unit next to one that Eames designed with the architect Eero Saarinen eight years earlier. Made entirely of wood and altogether more traditional, this early work helps one to appreciate both the innovation and the playful humor that the later piece encompassed -- and to measure Eames's artistic growth.

This exhibition presents design culture primarily as a discrete and extremely busy sphere, full of artists working with and against tradition, being influenced by each other, by distant cultures, by contemporary art. The section devoted to "Modern Decoration and Ornamentation" is dominated by modern artists themselves: the aforementioned Miro, Dali and Leger, and also Picasso, Dufy and Matisse -- the last two represented by impressive tapestries.
