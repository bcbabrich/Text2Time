Trade Center tenants hustled yesterday to find alternative spaces, and by last night it was apparent that in spite of the bomb, many would be back in business today.

For some companies, like Fuji Bank Ltd., the task of setting up for today was under way before employees vacated their trade center space Friday. Katsuma Ohara, general manager of the financial company's Americas division, said 150 of the 450 people in the trade center operation would be in a computer center in North Bergen, N.J. where the Fuji Bank had previously arranged for backup space. The rest would be in branch offices in Manhattan.

Workers at other companies will be moving in with colleagues and clients. Still other trade center companies will dispatch workers to their other nearby locations.

Yesterday morning, a half-dozen employees of Deloitte & Touche met a moving van packed with tax records of their clients, at the accounting company's temporary space in 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street.
