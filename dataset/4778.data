Robert Rauschenberg's "Rebus" from 1955 -- auctioned 18 months ago for a record $6.3 million -- was sold last night at Sothebys's in Manhattan for $7.3 million. The price was the highest paid at auction for a work by the artist and at Sotheby's current sale of postwar art.

Rauschenberg's curiously serene "Rebus," a huge 8-by-11-foot work splashed with paint, plaster, varnish, graffiti, a torn poster, comics and photographs, was added to Sotheby's sale after the catalogue went to press in early March. The owner, Hans Thulin, a Swedish real-estate investor, was ordered to sell "Rebus" by the Swedish finance company Nyckeln to whom he had given the work as collateral on a loan.

Bidding for "Rebus" was intense between at least three potential buyers -- two in the room and one who bid by telephone from an undisclosed location. Sotheby's did not identify the buyer. Contacted after the sale by telephone, the Manhattan art dealer Larry Gagosian was asked whether the buyer of "Rebus" was Charles Saatchi, the British advertising magnate for whom Mr. Gagosian acts as agent. "No, I bought 'Rebus,' " Mr. Gagosian said. "I think it is an incredible painting."

Asked if he had a client for the Rauschenberg, Mr. Gagosian replied, "We'll see." Americans Dominate Bidding
