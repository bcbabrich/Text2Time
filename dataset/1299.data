Yahoo is in talks to shed its 35 percent stake in its Yahoo Japan joint venture, possibly handing over control to its partner, Softbank, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Tuesday.

Any deal between Yahoo and Softbank is unlikely to be a straightforward sale of the stake and could instead take the form of a spinoff of some kind, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

No deal is imminent, these people said, adding that talks are continuing and may still fall apart.

Representatives for Yahoo and Softbank were not immediately available for comment.

The talks are taking place as Yahoo struggles to determine its future. The Internet pioneer has increasingly found itself outpaced by newer, faster-growing rivals like Google and Facebook, and has lagged in efforts to expand in hot new areas like social networking and group buying.

Yahoo’s discussions raise some questions about what the company may do with its roughly 40 percent stake in Alibaba. But these people cautioned that Yahoo isn’t contemplating any sale of its holdings in Alibaba, one of China’s most prominent Internet companies.

Softbank owns a stake in Alibaba as well.

Softbank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, previously hinted to DealBook that he would be interested in eventually striking a deal with Yahoo over the stake.

“Our interests and her interests do not necessarily contradict each other,” he said, referring to Yahoo’s chief executive, Carol A. Bartz. “Sooner or later we will have a win-win situation.”

News of the talks was first reported by Reuters.
