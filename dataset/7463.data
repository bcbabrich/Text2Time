LONDON, June 30 — Fifty paintings by Vasily Kandinsky, the Russian‐born artist, regarded as the father of abstract painting, were sold at a London auction tonight for £536,500 ($1,502,200).

The paintings, representing all phases of the artist's development, were among 170 collected by the late American financier Solomon R. Guggenheim. They were sold by the Guggenheim Foundation because, the foundation said, there was not enough room to exhibit them in the Guggenheim Museum in New York.

The decision to sell had been criticized in New York because it meant that many of the paintings would leave the United States.

Twenty‐one of the works. however, will return as a result of the auction, at which American buyers bid against British, French, German, Dutch, Swiss and others amid surroundings of evening dress, mink stoles and teardron chandeliers.
