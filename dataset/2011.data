National Journal is set to release its ideology ratings based on votes in Congress for current lawmakers, and its findings for some of the presidential contenders are somewhat surprising given their reputations.

On a scale of one to 100, with 100 being the most liberal, here are the Democratic contenders’ lifetime ratings:

Senator Barack Obama: 84.3

Representative Dennis Kucinich: 79.4

Senator Christopher J. Dodd: 79.2

Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton: 78.8

Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.: 76.8

On a scale of one to 100, with 100 being the most conservative, here are the Republican contenders’ lifetime ratings:

Representative Duncan Hunter: 82.5

Senator Sam Brownback: 81

Representative Tom Tancredo: 75.9

Senator John McCain: 71.8

Senator Chuck Hagel: 71.5

Representative Ron Paul: 51.7

Those lifetime numbers, however, aren’t the whole story. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, for example, shows a “clear-cut shift” from among the most liberal during the first half of her term to more moderate over the last three years, writes Richard E. Cohen. In 2006, despite his reputation for being a maverick, Senator Chuck Hagel was more conservative than either of the other G.O.P. senators in the race. The report will be available at National Journal’s website early Friday morning.

Speaking of Senator Clinton, get ready for the spectacle on Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Not only are she and Senator Barack Obama going to walk the Edmund Pettus Bridge in commemoration of those who fought for civil rights, she will be joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton on the march. Both the senators are speaking at churches there that day; Mr. Clinton himself is being inducted into the Voting Rights Hall of Fame.

McCain’s “Wasted” Gaffe

Mr. McCain backed away from his comment to David Letterman on Wednesday that “we wasted a lot of our most precious treasure, which is American lives over there.”

Democrats demanded that Mr. McCain apologize for saying the lives were “wasted,” much as Republicans called for Mr. Obama’s apology when he said, “We now have spent $400 billion and have seen over 3,000 lives of the bravest young Americans wasted.”

Mr. Obama, who apologized and called his own words “a slip of the tongue,” said did not say Mr. McCain owes an apology.

We have a duty, a sacred duty, to make sure we are honoring their sacrifice by giving them missions in which they can succeed. I’m positive that was the intent in which he meant it. It was the same intent that I had when I made my statement, John McCain and I may have disagreements. The one area that I don’t think he can be questioned is his dedication to American troops. He’s been there. He’s done that.

Indeed, Mr. McCain did not give one. He said in a statement from his Senate office that he “should have used the word ‘sacrificed,’ as I have in the past.”

Pence for President?

Given that the Republican frontrunners have not always been reliably conservative, rumors about vacuum-filling candidacies by popular conservatives have been popping up regularly. The latest is about Representative Mike Pence of Indiana. He’s got a prominent speaking slot at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington this weekend, and there’s also a grassroots site, Pence08.com.

“Congressman Pence has not ruled out a run in the near term or the long term,” said Matt Lloyd, Mr. Pence’s spokesman. The Hotline’s Marc Ambinder translated: “In other words: Pence is quite comfortable with the buzz.”

F.E.C. Rules for Obama

As expected, the Federal Election Commission officially agreed this morning to let Mr. Obama collect money for the general election, but give it all back to receive public financing if he chooses to later. (That’s if he became the Democratic nominee.) Both nominees would have to agree to participate in the public financing system, under this plan. The F.E.C. made it clear today that the procedures set for Mr. Obama’s potential opt-in later on weren’t necessarily the ones that other candidates could follow to opt for public financing.

Edwards College Tour

John Edwards is kicking off his four-city college tour today at the Metropolitan State College of Denver (the city where Mr. Edwards hopes to be named the nominee at the Democrats’ convention next year). He’ll hit University of California at Berkeley (that historical bastion of student activism) on Sunday, then U.C. Los Angeles on Monday and Howard University in Washington on March 14.

Despite the fact that the Edwards campaign has perhaps the most extensive web presence of any candidate from either party, Mr. Edwards has not made remarkable strides among young voters. A new analysis by Young Voter Strategies, a nonprofit group out of the George Washington University, shows young voters prefer Mr. Edwards at about the same frequency as Democrats generally — putting him around third place nationally. On the other hand, Mr. Obama “draws stronger support from young adults than from any other age group,” according to the report.
