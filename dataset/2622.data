I believe there can be a reasoned debate about tax law, environmental policy, gun control and even abortion. But to me, gay rights should be in the same category as creationism vs. science.

Most people who are antigay or creationists base their views on the mindless repetition of tradition, ignorance and prejudice, rather than on careful consideration.

It is appropriate for a newspaper intended for a relatively educated audience to privilege science over creationism. Likewise, it is appropriate to privilege tolerance over bigotry, or democracy over totalitarianism.
