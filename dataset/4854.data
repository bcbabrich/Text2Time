Venomous Spiders

Q. What is the most poisonous spider?

A. The most poisonous spider known is the black widow, Lactrodectus mactans, which has venom 15 times as toxic as the prairie rattle snake's, according to Dr. Alice L. Anderson, an entomologist for the State of North Carolina.

Because a spider has so much less venom than a snake, however, it can never inject as much into a person, Dr. Anderson said. Only 1 in 100 untreated black widow bites is fatal, as against 15 to 20 percent for the rattler. "If it had the same amount of venom, mortality would go way up," she said.

Black widows, the females black with an hourglass mark on the abdomen, live in every state but Alaska but are most common in the Southeast, she said. Its venom is a neurotoxin, a nerve poison that can cause muscle pain, a rigid abdomen, tightness in the chest, spasms of large muscle groups, excruciating abdominal pain, convulsions, paralysis and shock. There is an antivenin, and treatment for shock is also indicated.

Most spiders are venomous, but most of them have fangs too short or fragile to penetrate human skin. The brown recluse spider is also a problem, but death from its bite is fairly rare, Dr. Anderson said. Its toxin kills tissue and leaves scars; an untreated bite may require skin grafts.
