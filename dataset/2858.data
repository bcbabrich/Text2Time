It also establishes that Syria was a major arms-trading bazaar for the Hussein government, in this case hiding an Iraqi effort to obtain missiles, they say. Investigators say Syria had probably offered its ports and territory as the surreptitious transit route for the North Korea-Iraq missile deal, although it remains unclear what demands the government in Damascus might have made in return. Further, according to United States government officials and international investigators, the Iraqi official who brokered the deal, Munir Awad, is now in Syria, apparently living under government protection.

If it served as a middleman in this deal, as the documents suggest, Syria was acting in violation of Security Council resolutions even as it served on the Council and voted with the United States on the most important resolution before the war.

In an interview in Damascus on Sunday with The New York Times, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, was asked about the deal described in the Iraqi computer files and said, ''This is the first time I have heard this story.''

He said Mr. Hussein ''was never able to trust Syria, and he never tried and we never tried to make any relation between him and any other country because he did not trust us in the first place.'' For all its complaints about arms smuggling across the Syrian-Iraq border, Mr. Assad said, the United States had never cited specific cases, adding, ''I told the Americans if you have any evidence that there is smuggling of weapons into Iraq, please let us know.''

International inspectors note that the missile deal gone bad appears to be the most serious violation that has been found so far.

The investigators say they tripped upon it while looking for something far more nefarious -- evidence of a continuing nuclear program, or an active effort to accumulate more biological or chemical weapons.

''So far, there's really not much in that arena,'' said one official who has monitored the continuing search for weapons led by David Kay, a former weapons inspector who is now conducting the search for the Central Intelligence Agency.
