''This is one of the highest prices ever paid for industrial-zoned land in the area, if not on Long Island,'' said Jack O'Connor, vice president at Island Realty in Jericho. ''It is double the base level for new appraisals of property and, in the long range, when leases are up for renewal, could certainly create rental prices of more than the going rate of $22 to $23 a square foot.''

In the short run, land prices could directly affect room rates at the planned hotel, according to William Yung, president of Kentucky-based Columbia-Sussex. He said the $10 million that his company will pay for 13.2 acres at the intersection of Walt Whitman Road and the Long Island Expressway service road could be passed along in the $125 a night he expects to charge, possibly the highest rate on the Island.

''We'll be paying almost two and a half times as much as we've ever paid for hotel land,'' he said. By comparison, Columbia-Sussex paid $4 million for eight acres in Islandia, on which it is building a $33 million, 277-room Hilton Hotel. ''The Melville site is as expensive as downtown Manhattan,'' he said.

Nevertheless, he said, Columbia-Sussex chose the site in part because it was one of the few parcels zoned for hotels in the area. Although one hotel is under construction along Route 110, the Royce-Carlin, the road has been lacking in lodging despite the proliferation of corporate headquarters there in recent years.

Columbia-Sussex, Mr. Yung said, intends to build an ''upscale corporate hotel'' with conference rooms, restaurants and banquet facilities accommodating 1,000.

Norstar, meanwhile, will reportedly be paying similar prices for its 14.2 acres just east of the hotel site, on which it intends to develop a $22 million, 267,000-square-foot Long Island regional corporate headquarters. But potentially high rents have not scared off possible tenants from inquiring about renting space in the building when it becomes available, according to Thomas Doherty, Norstar chief executive officer.

Norstar's above-ground space in its four-story building actually appears as two 105,000-square-foot buildings attached by a 7,000-square-foot barrel atrium. The bank will occupy half the space with its executive headquarters, corporate lending group, commercial real-estate lending division, personal retail lending, financial division and other departments, Mr. Doherty said.
