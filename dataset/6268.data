Mayor Lindsay, in appealing for approval of the transportation bond issue, said:

“The preservation of the 35‐cent fare on the city's subways and buses through state‐matching subsidies and the maintenance of present fares on the commuter railroads is a principle which I have long supported.

“While the bond issue is not the only means through which this essential objective can be achieved, it is clear that it is the only one which has the support of the Governor and majority leaders in the State Senate and Assembly.”

The Mayor, who has disagreed with Governor Rockefeller on many matters, said it was “unfortunate” that no details had been made public on priorities in spending the bond money. But he added:

“Despite these drawbacks, I believe that, on balance, the transportation bond issue will be to the benefit of this city. Preservation of the fare at current levels and assuring state funds for additional subway construction outweigh the negative aspects of the proposition.”

In his message to the City Planning Commission, Mr. Lindsay, as is traditional, did not say precisely how much he wanted for each of the priority items.

However, Mr. Grossman pointed out that since in previous years Mayor Lindsay's administration had spent a great deal on construction of police stations and firehouses, much of the apital money for the coming year was intended for anticrime technology, such as the new voice‐alarm boxes and funds for block‐security programs.

The Budget Director also said that if the proposed exclusion of sewer construction and anti ‐ pollution facilities from the debt limit was voted down, the city would be forced to cut its construction of such projects.

The Planning Commission, after three days of hearings early in December, is to submit its draft for the capital budget to the Mayor on Jan. 2. By Feb. 1, the new Mayor is to give his executive capital budget to the City Council for its consideration.
