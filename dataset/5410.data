ROGERS & COWAN, a major American public relations firm that specializes in show business promotions, has been acquired by Shandwick P.L.C., Britain's largest public relations operation, which bought two other American companies in December.

Now, Shandwick is the world's largest independent public relations firm and third largest among all such companies, after Burson Marsteller, a subsidiary of Young & Rubicam, and Hill & Knowlton, a subsidiary of the JWT Group, according to Rogers & Cowan.

The first payment to Rogers & Cowan will be $3.5 million, some of which will go to the five shareholders as the first payment for the agency and the rest to be used as working capital. The total payment, based on company performance, could come to as much as $15 million over the next four years.

Rogers & Cowan will continue to operate under that name, and its founders Henry J. Rogers, 72 years old, and Warren J. Cowan, 65, have both signed long-term contracts, the company said.
