To the Editor:

Our Founding Fathers distinguished us from other countries by insuring that we would be free from the yoke of institutionalized religion. Contrary to Edward Morgan (Op-Ed, Dec. 25), the Bill of Rights includes the right of freedom from religion as well as the freedom to practice any religion.

The success rate of 80 percent that Mr. Morgan claims at the Bowery Mission is laudable. However, you can just as easily point to the planning, organizing, leading and controlling -- that is, good management -- as the reason the mission has achieved that rate. You could go further and ask whether many of people the mission serves are there because faith did not provide the tools to survive in our complex society.
