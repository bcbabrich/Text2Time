BAKING with flour is not the microwave oven's best trick, nor is browning. But when you want to do one or both of these things, the microwave oven can be a great aid in preparation that would otherwise take more time or be more annoying. The filling for a lemon-orange meringue pie can be made in the microwave oven. The crust is conventionally baked and the meringue is once again browned under the broiler. The lemon curd is easy to make in a microwave oven and does not scorch. It also contains no gelatin. It can be made ahead of time and left to chill overnight. The crust can also be baked ahead of time. For a nice variation, add orange sections and orange zest.
