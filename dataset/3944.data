I.B.M. made another big bet yesterday that its future depends on becoming a supplier of software and services for computer networks, by agreeing to purchase Tivoli Systems Inc. for $743 million.

As corporations increasingly cut payrolls, they are trying to enable fewer people to do more work by giving them powerful personal computers on office desktops and linking the machines together. Tivoli is a small but fast-growing specialist in making software for managing these networks of PC's.

This new model of computing, called client-server, is intended to cut costs and improve efficiency by allowing the easy sharing of information. The International Business Machines Corporation made a huge acquisition in the network field last year when it bought the Lotus Development Corporation for $3.5 billion.

Lotus's Notes software is a leading program that lets workers share documents and files in computer-linked teams. Tivoli makes software that helps keep these complex client-server networks up and running. In client-server technology, individual users, or clients, are "served" over a network by a central machine that acts as a common repository of information and programs.
