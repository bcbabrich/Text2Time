Ms. Recht was arrested this afternoon and charged with making false statements to a Federal agency, a crime that carries a potential maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

The Federal authorities would not say whether they knew why Ms. Recht, 34 years old, had falsified the threats or whether any of those reported were, in fact, the work of others. The authorities would also not say when she had started falsifying the threats or how many she had falsified.

The housing plan was ordered by a Federal judge as a partial remedy for four decades of what the court found to be intentional segregation in education and housing. The judge ordered the building of 200 units of low-income housing and 800 units of moderate-income housing in mostly white neighborhoods.

Soon after the angry Council session, Ms. Recht became the focus of newspaper articles and television programs as a voice of compliance and accommodation to the plan, which continues to split the city. In May, she was honored by the College of New Rochelle for her role in the case. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters as the ''lone voice of reason'' seeking civil discourse in the city. The ceremony was two weeks after she received a B.A. summa cum laude from the State University of New York at Purchase.

Throughout the year, Ms. Recht complained to the police and F.B.I. that she was receiving telephoned death threats and suffering the painting of swastikas and threats outside her apartment door. The actions continued, she said, even after she had her telephone number changed and unlisted.
