From reports of 576 hospital emergency rooms during the first three months of 1986, The National Institute of Drug Abuse said there has been a significant rise in the smoking of cocaine nationally among people coming to hospitals for treatment of cocaine-related problems.

From January through March 14.5 percent of the people admitted with cocaine-related problems said they had smoked the drug. In the same period in 1985, 10.1 percent said they smoked cocaine. In the same period in 1984, the number was 4.2 percent. The institute said the rise in cocaine smoking - which can include crack or so-called ''free-base'' smoking of powdered cocaine - was particularly sharp in New York, San Diego, Miami and Detroit.

But in most cities, including Chicago, Washington, Boston and San Francisco, the crack problem is not as severe as in New York, and estimates on the eventual extent of crack use are based in large part on New York's experience.

It is also unclear how far crack use will spread beyond the poor and working class.

While the police have seized the cars of suburbanites buying crack in the city, and private drug treatment programs report rising numbers of affluent people coming for treatment of addiction, the rate of crack use among middle- and upper-class people has not yet been clearly documented.

The neighborhoods where the crack problem is the worst and continues to grow are poor and working-class neighborhoods like Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan and Jamaica and Jackson Heights, Queens, research by the New York State Division of Substance Abuse Control indicates.

A survey in May by a national cocaine hot line of 458 cocaine users found that the majority were ''lower-middle-class working people'' with incomes of $10,000 to $25,000, according to the director of research for the hotline, Dr. Arnold M. Washton.

But since drug use in affluent areas is generally more discrete and harder to observe, how much the crack problem has grown outside of poorer neighborhoods is still a matter of speculation.
