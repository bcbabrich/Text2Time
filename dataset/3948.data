With Senator Bob Dole and Steve Forbes ardently seeking his endorsement for the Republican Presidential nomination, Jack F. Kemp said today that he had reached a decision: he would not pick either one, yet.

"I'm going to keep my neutrality for now," Mr. Kemp told reporters on Capitol Hill, where he presented his tax reform commission's proposals to the Senate Finance Committee.

Mr. Kemp, a former United States representative and Housing Secretary, had said he intended to endorse Mr. Dole or Mr. Forbes before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 12. But today he seemed still torn between Mr. Forbes, a close friend, and Mr. Dole, who named him to the tax panel.
