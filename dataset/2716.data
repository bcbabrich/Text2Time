On Feb. 8, 1668, after writing about the political perversities of the House of Commons in his now-famous diary, Samuel Pepys described a more private scandal. That day, he confessed, he bought ''an idle, roguish French book, 'L'Escholle des Filles,' which I have bought in plain binding (avoiding the buying of it better bound), because I resolve, as soon as I have read it, to burn it, that it may not stand in the list of books, nor among them, to disgrace them, if it should be found.''

This was a peculiar confession: Pepys (pronounced peeps) would burn a pornographic volume to avoid disgrace, but document its purchase in a diary that survived his every purge of his private papers. It is as if the diary served an almost sacral purpose, possessing immunity from the retributions of shame. It was religiously kept over the period of a decade. Its continuing stature is confirmed in 11 annotated volumes published by the University of California Press.

The diary has come to mind in recent weeks because of Claire Tomalin's elegant new biography, ''Samuel Pepys: The Unequaled Self'' (Knopf), which won Britain's prestigious Whitbread literary prize this week. In addition, beginning in January, a British Web site designer, Phil Gyford, started posting a public-domain edition of the diary on his www.pepysdiary.com), adding entries day by day, as if the 17th-century London official were filing confessional dispatches via a vintage Thinkpad. Meanwhile, readers annotate the site, explaining obscurities, raising questions, creating a new cyberedition of the diary.

Mr. Gyford, in other words, has begun to treat the diary as a blog -- a Web log -- one of the hundreds of thousands of online daily diaries that have been proliferating on the Internet, mixing confession, criticism and commentary. Blogging, as it is called, is, of course, quite different from keeping a diary. But if Pepys's diary anticipated a sea change in how public and private worlds interact, blogging may as well.
