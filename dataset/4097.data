Traveling by rail has always meant checking what time of day the train runs, but beginning Feb. 1, on most long Amtrak routes it will also mean checking what day the train runs: Five major trains will be cut to three or four times a week, instead of daily. In addition, 10 routes that once operated as extensions of major trains -- with cars that linked up to a cross-country train, or peeled off to take a spur line -- will be eliminated on April 1; so will three short routes.

And that is just the first round. Amtrak, which announced the cuts on Dec. 14, plans more of them next year.

"In the past, we have tried to be every place all the time," said Thomas M. Downs, the president of Amtrak, in announcing the cuts. But passengers have voted with their wallets, he said, and "we can't afford that anymore."

The good news is that with the service cuts, the railroad can retire nearly all of its oldest equipment, the cars it inherited from private railroads when it was created by Congress in 1971. The remaining cars are more comfortable and more reliable, the railroad says.
