Colleen Walker was sitting in a tent two summers ago, describing in detail her every golf shot to reporters at the Mastercard International Pro-Am. She was recounting her final round, explaining how for the first time she had placed second in a Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour event.

Walker, then in her fifth year on the Tour, was relieved at having finally made some money at the game she so diligently worked on as a youth. But her relief soon turned to shock as she noticed a scoring error on her card, a card she already had made official with her signature. Walker turned herself in, forfeiting an $18,000 payday.

''I was going over my card with the press when I noticed I had written down a 5 for the 16th hole,'' Walker recalled. ''On that hole, I hit a tree on my second shot. I just forgot I did it. I really had a 6. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't turn myself in.''

Ironically, three weeks earlier Walker lost $2,000 for signing an incorrect scorecard at the du Maurier Classic in Toronto. In less than a month, Walker, who earned $44,000 the entire 1985 season, had thrown away almost half of that because of mistakes with a pencil.
