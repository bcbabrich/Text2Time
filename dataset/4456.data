IT'S the kind of exhibition where yes, you can take something home with you. After touring "Red Grooms at Grand Central," which includes riding the artist's rollicking subway car or listening to his cab driver's monologue, you can stop and pick up a souvenir.

There are T-shirts with the Statue of Liberty, left, ($18 for adults, $15 for children) and a series of posters that can be cut out into three-dimensional Charlie Chaplins, Fats Dominos or checker cabs, left, ($18).

The show, in the majestic refurbished waiting rooms of the terminal, is sponsored by the Dreyfus Corporation and continues to July 31. Hours are Monday through Friday from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M; Thursday to 9 P.M.; Saturday and Sunday from noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $3.
