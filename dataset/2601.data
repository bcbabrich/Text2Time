We all nurture our ''own unique image for purity,'' according to a brochure for ''Whiteout,'' an exhibition at Felissimo Design House, 10 West 56th Street, that includes ''Used and Abused'' porcelain cups, $17 each, above. And white, of course, symbolizes purity.

But which white?

Two museums, two answers. ''We were looking for something neutral,'' said Jennifer Sage, of Sage & Coombe, the architect for the renovation of the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, 32-37 Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City, Queens. Her firm's choice: Benjamin Moore Regal Wall Satin in Super White ($22.59 a gallon). At the Museum of Modern Art, scheduled to reopen in November, the search for the right white was complicated by reflections from the new wooden floors, which made some whites look tan on the ceilings. The Modern chose Janovic Super White -- mostly latex interior flat ($19.59 a gallon), but occasionally a Janovic eggshell. ''The eggshell finish in the Benjamin Moore went way green,'' said Jerome Neuner, the Modern's director of exhibition design and production.
