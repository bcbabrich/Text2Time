TOO LATE -- Today is the day General Motors ends its employee-discount promotion, so if you want to get a reduction from the sticker price, starting tomorrow you'll have to go back to old-fashioned haggling. It seems like the program was a smashing success: G.M. sales surged 42 percent in the first 15 days of July from a year earlier, and Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which joined the price-cutting fray, also enjoyed big rebounds. Look for record or near-record figures when vehicle sales are announced this week. (Tomorrow.)

OPEN WALLETS -- The big question is how wide consumers are opening them in places like Wal-Mart and Macy's. Everything else seems to be up these days -- car sales, stocks (the Nasdaq hit a four-year high last Thursday), real estate (aside from ever-surging prices, sales of existing homes hit a record annual rate in June), industrial output, business spending -- so why not store sales? Come on, shoppers, do your duty. (Thursday).

BACK TO THE 4'S? -- Well, not everything's going up. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent from its post-9/11 peak of 6.3 percent, and this week we'll find out whether the happy trend continued in June. Was Friday's announcement that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter a good omen? It was a shade below economists' expectations of 3.5 percent growth, but it might be enough to do the trick and certainly will do nothing to throw Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan off course of continuing to raise interest rates.

TOP SECRET -- This week, the World Trade Organization is scheduled to produce a ruling -- planned to be a confidential one -- on the European Union's restrictions on genetically modified crops. European environmentalists and much of the European public support the bans, but industry says it violates fair-trade rules. It is just one of several trade disputes between the United States and Europe, including American protests over government subsidies to Airbus. (Friday)
