Even by the transient standards of the sport he governs, David Stern's itinerary was beginning to get out of hand. Chicago to Munich to Chicago to London to Chicago to the start of the National Basketball Association regular season Friday night.

"I'm negotiating with Granik to handle London," the N.B.A. commissioner said recently with a sigh. He was referring to his deputy, Russell Granik, and preseason games at Wembley Arena this past weekend between the Orlando Magic and the Atlanta Hawks.

Clearly, it was time for Stern to prioritize.

In Munich, it was the Phoenix Suns' turn to carry the N.B.A. banner into the global basketball community. In London, there was another lucrative market in which to nest. But for all the N.B.A.'s much-publicized efforts to achieve nirvana-by-satellite, Stern's reluctance to leave Chicago was an indication that something may be rotten at the core of this American sports machine.

Stern has not been in Chicago trying to convince Michael Jordan to unretire. Contrary to popular belief, the stunning departure of the game's greatest star ranks low on his list of current headaches. With all due respect, Stern's 25-year association with the N.B.A. has convinced the 50-year-old son of a New York deli owner that the reservoir of superior talent never runs dry. But in his opinion, the collective good will that has been the driving force behind the league's meteoric rise since the early 1980's is as fragile and precious as the ligaments in every player's knee.
