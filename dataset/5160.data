Come down the hill, go north from Winchcombe for a couple of miles, and you jump over 3,000 years in time. Hailes Abbey was a Cistercian foundation, one of Henry VIII's victims during the dissolution of the monasteries. Today it is an elegant ruin, its golden cloisters glowing against a dark backdrop of trees. It has the melancholy and perfection of many ruins, making you feel that it can never have been other than it is now, with a few visitors wandering around the archways trying to puzzle out the arrangement of the abbey church, the refectory and wood pigeons moaning in the chestnuts. It is only when you go into the little museum that you begin to glimpse the realities of that vanished monastic empire - in which a great monastery presided over an area, extracting wealth from far and wide, its flocks of sheep munching the grasslands, the monks acting both as employers and exploiters. And, of course, the monastery was the center of culture; in the museum, fragments of medieval tiles, ornate and delicate, and the great sculptural bosses from the roof of the abbey give a potent taste of the splendors of the place at the height of its prosperity.

Just across the road is the little parish church, with some of the most evocative medieval wall paintings I know, even in an area rich with these reminders that once all churches were blazoned with pattern and story. At Hailes there are two sto-ries - on one wall is St. Christopher, patron saint of (Continued on Page 94) travelers, here a shadowy figure with a staff making his way across a river; opposite is a rare secular painting of a hare crouching under a tree, ears laid back in fear, facing two panting greyhounds. Elsewhere are patchy fragments of fleurs-de-lis and in one corner is a grotesque owl creature straight out of Hieronymus Bosch.

I can remember, as a schoolgirl, trailing around in the wake of my grandmother and my aunt, knowledgeable church buffs, while they reveled in clerestories and misericords. All I wanted to do was get home for tea. I can't remember now when I saw the light and learned to savor the pleasures of church-crawling for myself - but there is no better place in which to do it than this hinge of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. Arm yourself with the appropriate volume of Nikolaus Pevsner's ''Buildings of England,'' or one of the several competent guides to parish churches, and you will soon become immersed in distinguishing Perpendicular from Decorated, searching for medieval brasses and arrestingly phrased wall memorials, wandering through cow parsley and meadowsweet in the churchyard to read the gravestones. An afternoon of this is infinitely more satisfying than the routine visit to some scheduled place of interest - you feel a proper sense of discovery, a pride of possession.

That being said, there are a couple of well-visited places that should not be missed. Sudeley Castle, just outside Winchcombe, is a Tudor pile once fallen into ruin and replenished in the 19th century by an indomitable wealthy collector called Mrs. Enna Dent, who pieced the place together again and furnished it with an eclectic lot of stuff, much of which is there now, including some fine paintings - a Turner and a Constable, a Van Dyck and a Jan Steen. Outside, there are yowling peacocks, hedges of yew and box clipped to within an inch of their lives and manicured gravel paths. All a bit too neat and tidy, to my eye, but the arthritic old oaks in the parkland are a compensation. Indeed, Sudeley is perhaps a good example of what goes right and wrong with the professional stately home trying to keep its end up in the marketplace of tourism today. Display and information are well done, but the spit and polish is carried too far and somehow drains the place of much feeling of reality. And, of course, there is the ubiquitous shop. Plus a craft center - another essential ingredient these days, it seems - in which decently crafted goods are distressingly mixed up with some dreadful kitsch. S NOWS HILL MANOR, A few miles away in the village of Snowshill, is more to my taste. The house itself is a traditional Cots-wold manor house - sprawling, architecturally incoherent, stiff with beams and mullioned windows and paneling and unexpected little rooms and staircases. The gardens are a delight - sunny walled terraces leading one from another, sweeps of lawn and great brooding trees. But the function of the place today is as a shrine to British eccentricity. We are rather good at eccentrics, and Charles Wade, who owned Snowshill from 1919 till his death in 1956, was a champion among them. He was a collector. Not one of your deliberate, organized, fastidious collectors, but a wonderful crazy jackdaw collector - accumulating everything and anything from lace bobbin winders and Bath chairs to suits of Japanese samurai armor.

There it all is, this glorious jumble of acquisition, crammed into the many rooms of the manor, without much attempt at rhyme or reason; and, indeed, you would be hard put to impose order on an accumulation that has little or no binding theme other than a vague predilection for the Oriental.

Charles Wade's taste in furniture was simple: if it is veneered, gilt-encrusted, has drawers, miniature porticoes, pillars with ornate capitals, inlay of any kind - buy it. Furniture as architecture - ''Chinese cabinet of black and gold lacquer in the form of a Buddhist shrine; large cabinet with brass inlay and semiprecious stones; Spanish Vargueno cabinet . . . ,'' the guidebook gives up in despair. And there are the 15 spinning wheels and the 28 leather fire buckets and the dozens of enormous keys displayed in a glass case and the Admiral Room with its ships and globes and instruments of navigation. There is also a room with nothing but old musical instruments, from hurdy-gurdies to an 18th-century cello and an ophicleide and three citterns.

From time to time Charles Wade seems to have run amok completely - 11 German Black Forest clocks, for heaven's sake, and what must be the prototype of a baby bouncer (heavily worn) and the most ancient baby strollers I've ever seen. Up in the attic is a cavalcade of antique bicycles, with a hefty penny-farthing triumphantly presiding. There are models of haywagons, a couple of feet long with shaft, and each of them different, crafted replicas of the various kinds used in English counties -Wiltshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex . . .
