Georges Duboeuf's 2000 Beaujolais-Villages is bottled springtime.

Its color explains why Mr. Duboeuf reigns as ''King of Beaujolais,'' born to the purple. Did a perfumery supply the bouquet? The juicy, lingering flavor celebrates the gamay grape's seeming joie de vivre. The wine charms, seduces, refreshes.

Available citywide, it's $7 for a regular bottle and $14 for a magnum (two bottles in one) at Heights Chateau, 131 Atlantic Avenue (Henry Street) in Brooklyn. HOWARD G. GOLDBERG
