METROSTARS

The new regime of the MetroStars is apparently determined to renovate the struggling team more drastically than expected. People in Major League Soccer with knowledge of their plans said yesterday that the MetroStars have asked the league to find a team elsewhere for Sasa Curcic, whose tattoos and behavior make him the team's version of Dennis Rodman.

The MetroStars contend that Curcic is more of a playmaker than a goal scorer, and a goal scorer is what they need to play alongside Henry Zambrano, their main striker. It appears that Hernan Medford, a Costa Rican playing for Leon in Mexico, may be the allocated foreigner the MetroStars will get in place of Curcic.

Curcic was in Europe yesterday when the MetroStars left for Florida to begin training for the coming season. People familiar with the team's plans said Curcic would be removed from the team's roster for salary cap purposes.

Last Friday the club acquired 38-year-old Thomas Dooley. Dooley played for Columbus in M.L.S. and for the United States national team beginning in 1992 after it was discovered that his father was a United States Army veteran who married a German woman.
