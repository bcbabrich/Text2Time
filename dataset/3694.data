Politics here have been thrown into a free-for-all after Panamanians crushed President Ernesto Perez Balladares's hopes for a second term by a resounding margin of nearly 2 to 1.

Voters defeated a proposal that would have amended the Constitution to allow him to serve five more years and thereby control the Panama Canal when the United States relinquishes the waterway at the end of next year.

According to complete unofficial results tabulated early today, 64 percent of the 1.1 million voters on Sunday rejected the change. The defeat was larger than any poll had predicted. Mr. Perez Balladares, once a member of the inner circle of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, said he regretted the results and promised ''a pure and honest election'' on May 2.

With the incumbent out of the picture, a scramble for nomination of the ruling party is certain, and a larger number of opposition leaders may also be tempted to run.
