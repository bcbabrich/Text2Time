Smashing what they described as a smuggling ring that brought children to Brooklyn from Jamaica, detectives raided a Flatbush apartment yesterday and arrested five adults they accused of collecting thousands of dollars from anxious immigrant parents.

Two children had arrived from Jamaica over the weekend -- a boy and a girl, each 9 years old, the police said. They were sharing bunk beds in the cramped two-bedroom apartment with six younger children who are relatives of the adults who were taken into custody. All eight appeared to be in good condition, the police said, but as a precaution they were taken to local hospitals for observation.

An investigator on the case, Sgt. George Carrig, said the police found out about the ring from a Bronx woman who had hired the suspects to bring her 9-year-old son to this country. The boy had been living with his grandmother in Jamaica since his mother moved to this country in 1991.

The woman, described by the police as an illegal immigrant, said that she had paid $1,100 in advance, but had received a call yesterday saying that she could pick up her son only if she paid another $2,000. She said she was told to hand over the money on a street corner a few blocks from the apartment. Phone Number Traced
