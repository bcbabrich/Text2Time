Eric Broadley, a onetime cabinetmaker from Britain who became an acclaimed designer of racecars whose speedy creations won the Indianapolis 500 and numerous other events, died May 28 in Cambridge, England. He was 88.

The cause was complications of a stroke, his daughter Diane Broadley said.

Mr. Broadley, a tinkerer and self-taught engineer, started building cars in his spare time at the urging of his cousin Graham Broadley. In 1958, they emerged with the Mk1, a lightweight sports car that Eric Broadley raced at the Brands Hatch track in Kent. In a qualifying heat, he raced faster than anyone there ever had.

The press “was around like bees round a honey pot” after his stunning time, Mr. Broadley told Motor Sport magazine in 1989. But the race meet’s organizer suggested that a car that fast should be driven by a better, quicker driver than him. Mr. Broadley agreed, conceding that “my inexperience showed very, very quickly.” (He was disciplined in the final for erratic driving.)

The car’s performance at Brands Hatch was a breakthrough. Mr. Broadley and his cousin received orders to produce more Mk1s from their modest garage. In the decades that followed, working under the Lola Cars name, Mr. Broadley would design and build myriad cars that raced on various circuits, including Formula One, CART and IndyCar. His work earned him a reputation that rivaled other contemporary British racecar designers like Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus Cars.
