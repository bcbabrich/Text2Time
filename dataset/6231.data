Nathalia Crane, poet and teacher, was married Dec. 13 in San Diego, Calif., to Peter O'Reilly, a professor of philosophy at California State University in San Diego. The bride lectures on poetry and world literature there.

California Superior Court Justice Hugo Fisher performed the ceremony in his chambers. Dr. and Mrs. Stanley N. Weissman attended the couple.

The bridegroom, who was ordained a Roman Catholic priest, is a former assistant professor of philosophy and past chairman of the campus chapter of the United Federation of College Teachers at St. John's University, where he was a leader of a strike in 1966. Faculty members were seeking a greater voice in university affairs.

Mrs. O'Reilly, widow of Vete George Black, is the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Porter Crane of New York and Brooklyn. Her father was a newspaperman. The bride's first volume of poetry, “The Janitor's Boy,” and another work, “Lava Lane,” were published in the early nineteen‐twenties. She also is the author of two novels and a dozen other books.
