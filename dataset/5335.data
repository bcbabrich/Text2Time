The Soviet Union and China have agreed to fix the position of most of their eastern border and are expanding talks to include the western frontier, a Soviet spokesman said today.

The agreements were reached during the past 11 days at the third round of Soviet-Chinese border talks in Moscow, said the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov.

Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Jiangpei led Beijing's delegation to the talks, which ended today. The Soviet side was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Yegor A. Rogachev.

''The sides considered the question of the border line in its eastern part and reached an understanding on the larger part of this section of the border,'' Mr. Gerasimov told a news briefing. He gave no details.
