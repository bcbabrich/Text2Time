Latin America's Roman Catholic bishops reaffirmed last week that the needs of the region's poor should continue to have first call on the attention of the church. But unlike previous gatherings of this scope, the latest meeting of the Latin American Episcopal Conference proved to be primarily a holding action on church policy.

On Wednesday, the 300 bishops ended more than two weeks of deliberations at the conference in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic without endorsing any major new directions in church policy or practice. Their sessions often bogged down in procedural difficulties and a tug-of-war between bishops urging change for the Latin American church and Vatican officials who are allied with conservative church leaders.

Earlier meetings of the bishops' conference, in Medellin, Colombia, in 1968 and Puebla, Mexico, in 1979, were pace-setting events for Catholicism worldwide. They implanted into Catholic teaching the notion that the church should exercise a "preferential option for the poor" and frame its theology in response to the special problems of particular localities.

In a brief "Message to the Peoples of Latin America," the bishops in Santo Domingo declared their commitment to the positions taken at those earlier meetings, ending speculation that conservative policies pursued by Pope John Paul II and other Vatican officials might induce the bishops to re-emphasize more traditional doctrinal themes.
