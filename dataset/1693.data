And the honor of handling General Motors‘ bankruptcy filing goes to — Robert E. Gerber.

Judge Gerber, of the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, was the randomly assigned arbiter of the carmaker’s huge Chapter 11 case. Among the cases he has worked on are those of Adelphia and Global Crossing, and, more recently, the chemical giant Lyondell and the consulting firm Bearingpoint.

Before joining the bench in 2000, Mr. Gerber was a partner at the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, specializing in bankruptcy.
