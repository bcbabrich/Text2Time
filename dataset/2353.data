A 14-year-old boy died yesterday when he was struck by a pickup truck in South Jamaica, the police said. The boy, identified by the authorities as Jayvon Hammond, 14, of 131st Avenue in Jamaica, darted between two buses idling on Merrick Boulevard near the intersection of Baisley Boulevard just before 3 p.m. He was struck by a black pickup truck that was traveling west on Merrick Boulevard, and was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said. The driver of the truck stayed at the scene and was not charged, the police said. Ana Germoso, who owns the house where the boy's family lives in an upstairs apartment, said that the family had lived there only a short while, and that Jayvon was "a very good boy."
