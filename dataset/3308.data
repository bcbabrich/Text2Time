For those staying at home, Mexicans in New York, Florida, Illinois, California, Texas, Iowa, Washington, Ohio, Michigan and elsewhere are holding symbolic elections, and will deliver their ballots to Mexican election officials to register their political views.

For decades, Mexicans here had been dismissed by the Mexican government, and no effort was made to involve them in the political system. But now, Mexicans abroad have reached such a critical mass -- an estimated one in nine Mexicans lives in the United States -- and have become an economic lifeline for countless people in Mexico. Mexicans here send about $7 billion a year to their families and to churches and public programs in their hometowns, the country's third biggest source of legal foreign exchange, after oil and tourism.

''It used to be presidential candidates couldn't leave the country for six months before an election -- Mexicans were that afraid of foreign influence,'' said Rodolfo de la Garza, a political science professor at the University of Texas. ''I was quite surprised when these guys were up here running around, campaigning.''

Professor de la Garza said some emigrants had begun ''influencing politics in Mexico,'' adding, ''They shape the local campaign, get the local government to respond to domestic pressures, embarrass the mayor by saying, 'We're not going to give you this money.' ''

While he and other observers say it is unclear how many Mexicans here are intensely interested in Mexico's politics and thus how influential they will be, at least some are paying close attention. Mr. Fox got a rally and parade in Chicago in May, and some people are actively coaching relatives about Sunday's election.

Not being allowed to vote in Mexico's elections is a major issue for some Mexicans here. Other immigrants here have the right to vote in their home countries, but the number of Mexicans in the United States -- possibly 15 percent of the Mexican electorate -- makes it sensitive for the Mexican government and a potentially touchy subject for American politicians too.

Last year, Mexico's Congress passed a bill to give expatriate Mexicans the right to cast ballots at certain foreign locations, but the bill was blocked in the Senate by the PRI. That has made the issue even bigger here, and both Mr. Fox and Mr. Cardenas champion it. Mexicans here are presumed to be more supportive of opposition candidates because they blame the PRI for economic hardships that prompted them to emigrate.
