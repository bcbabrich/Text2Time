CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 31' —Wassily W. Leontief, Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard, has been appointed chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows, Nathan M. Pusey, the university's president, said today. Professor Leontief will be the third chairman of the 30‐year‐old society, which was founded by the late president of Harvard, A. Lawrence Lowell.

The new chairman is known for his pioneering in the socalled “input‐output” method widely used in the study of economics. Input and output analysis shows all transactions between business concerns. Inputs are what the business buys, and outputs are what it sells.

Dr. Pusey also announced the election as Senior Fellows of Herbert Bloch, professor of Greek and Latin, and David Owen, Gurney Professor of History and Political Science.
