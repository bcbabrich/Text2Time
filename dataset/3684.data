Mr. Fleischer and others credit the Brazilian President with acting quickly to contain the effects of the Asian crisis. [Wednesday's auction of Telebras, which brought the Government $19 billion for its controlling stake in the national telecommunications system, showed that investors remain bullish on the country's medium- and long-term prospects.]

Indeed, Brazil receives the most direct foreign investment of any emerging market.

This all has created a certain euphoria about Brazil's prospects, but analysts stress that the nation's economic health has suffered with the President's failure to follow through. In part because of the sharp increase in interest rates, the budget deficit climbed to 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product, with the deficit for April nearly 80 percent higher than that for April 1997.

''A lot of the measures were 'for the English to see,' '' said Alexandre Barros, an economic consultant, using an expression dating back to the 1800's, when Brazil, deeply in debt to England, distracted its creditors by pledging to turn over customs revenue, which had been falsely inflated.

Despite the pledges to outsiders, Mr. Barros said, the Government has increased rather than cut spending since November. ''The Government did a lot, but the lot that it did was not enough, especially with the deficit,'' he said.

In a recent interview in Brasilia, Finance Minister Pedro Malan acknowledged that the austerity measures President Cardoso promoted last fall were ''absolutely essential'' to shoring up Brazil's standing at the time. Though they were not all carried out, he said, ''we showed that we were firmly committed to continuing to move forward with the real.''

With the country's foreign-exchange reserves at nearly $71 billion, after falling to $52 billion when the Government was forced to defend the currency last fall, Mr. Malan argued that Brazil was now ''in a better position,'' and he called a devaluation ''out of the question.'' The real, which trades within an exchange-rate band, is selling at 1.163 to the dollar, down from 1.10 last November.

The economic and financial restructuring effort known here as the Real Plan began four years ago. It proceeded from his time as Finance Minister in the previous administration, reducing inflation to less than 5 percent this year from quadruple digits at its worst stage. And it has helped lift millions of Brazilians out of poverty, in part by broadening access to credit. Before the effects of the Asian crisis spread, the sales of cars, appliances and other consumer goods had mushroomed in this country.
