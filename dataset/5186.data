Turner Broadcasting System Inc. signed a four-year, $275 million contract with the National Basketball Association yesterday that nearly tripled the annual license fee that cable television now pays to professional basketball.

In early November, the N.B.A. also tripled the value of its broadcast-television arrangement when NBC agreed to pay $600 million for four years for television rights to league games.

When the promotional services won from NBC are included, the total N.B.A. television arrangement for the 1990-93 seasons is worth nearly $925 million. Under the league's agreement with the players, 53 percent of the income from the sale of television rights must go to the players, and the new deals will probably push the average salary past $1 million from the current $750,000.

Under the new agreement, TNT will show 50 regular-season games and at least 25 playoff games. The regular-season games are usually shown on Tuesday and Friday evenings.
