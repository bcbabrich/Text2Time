Sir Colin and Lord King, chairman of British Airways, have also been concerned that the European Community would force British Airways to give up some of its landing and takeoff rights at London's Heathrow Airport as a condition for the Sabena deal. They had said they would cancel the deal rather than do so. Change at the Top

Under the agreement with Sabena, British Airways and KLM had until the end of the year to pull out. And the European Community has yet to make a decision: the process was delayed when Sabena's former chairman, Carlos van Rafelghem, suffered a stroke during the summer. His successor, Pierre Godfroid, former head of the Campbell Soup Company's European operations, assumed his full-time duties at Sabena only this month.

A British Airways spokesman said today that the uncertainties over the European Community ruling were a secondary reason for the deal's falling apart. The British Government had already given the deal a green light, so British Airways was optimistic that the community would also not demand major concessions from it, he said.

Mr. Godfroid, however, was not eager to rush ahead with the deal before sorting out the current financial problems of the company and reviewing its strategy, said people familiar with the negotiations who insisted on anonymity. Mr. Godfroid hopes to complete the reorganization and recapitalization by the end of January.

"British Airways will continue discussions with the new chairman of Sabena S.A.," Sir Colin said.

Peter Wellhuner, a KLM spokesman, said the Dutch company was also "still very much interested in talks with Sabena about future cooperation."

British Airways also hopes to develop a hub in Berlin to serve as a center for connecting flights between Eastern and Western Europe, as well as to continue serving the German domestic market.

An agreement signed by the allies at the end of World War II enabled British Airways to become a domestic German carrier. It serves nine western German cities out of Berlin. But with German reunification, those rights will be phased out over the next three years. In a bid to retain the rights and to get an opportunity to develop Berlin into a major international hub, British Airways is now trying to create a new German airline in which it would have a minority interest.
