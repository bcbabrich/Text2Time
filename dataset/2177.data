“We laugh at your religion, you people of the sand.” — Ronnie James Dio

Last Friday’s sermon verged on the venomous.

The preacher’s words were pregnant with anger, trembling with the coveted emotion irrepressible from generation to the next : “O Dear prophet, shall thee be insulted and we are millions!”

Examples followed, some of them involving slaying, and at the end, murmurs of approval and wrath were exchanged amongst the people in the mosque. I felt uncomfortable with the scene, seeking counsel, I looked to the right. Ali, lead-guitarist in our no-particular-place-to-go heavy metal band, Hamballah, was serenely picking his nose. I felt gutted. I prayed. I walked out with a bad taste in my mouth.

The sermon addressed the act of Danish newspapers publishing caricatures that ridiculed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. This act was naturally taken heavily by the hordes of stressed Muslims, and showed the real, unflinching public image of Islam in the eye of the common people of the West.

This puts a cool dude like me in such a tough spot, torn apart by my love for Western rationality but still much endowed with an Eastern devotion to my religion, It was not easy to decide what my own reaction should be.

When I first found out about the Abu Ghraib scandals, I wasn’t shocked. I wasn’t angry, insulted or surprised. I didn’t take it personally, even the raping. All I said was, “It’s about time they uncovered this.” Prison sadism is a natural thing driven by human instinct. It happens, regardless of who is on the hitting end and who is on the receiving end.

And so are these caricatures natural, too. On one hand, if you think about it rationally for a moment, Islam’s Western image has been run way too far in the mud after Sept. 2001 by the deeds of extremists, Islam’s most notorious inner disease. The image grew darker, less tolerant and more violent day by day. And no countermeasures have been effective enough to stop this. After all, what is equal to blood but blood itself?

You should also keep in mind that religious influence is much more rubbery in the West than it is here. It is not taken so seriously in the West: similar treatments have befallen Jesus, Moses and the Almighty himself (Bruce Almighty, anyone?). After all, caricatures are meant to ridicule. The images of the prophet as sexist and barbaric is the natural outcome of all the blood mistakenly shed in the name of Islam.

On the other hand, when I first saw these caricatures, I felt an irrepressible anger and wrath. Seeing a character as revered and majestic as the prophet — peace be upon him — humiliated and treated this way made my blood boil, I felt like the animals in George Orwell’s classic “Animal Farm” when the humans destroyed their windmill — an ancient hatred spurred by rational lies and pretexts.

On Sunday here in Iraq, six crowded churches were bombed and the civil boycotting of Danish products, heavily advocated by mosques, is now spreading throughout the Middle East. By waging this mad, irrational war on an international scale, Muslims are falling into a trap. The Danish newspaper must have published the drawings as a test, to see how much Islamic extremism has influenced freedom of expression. Since then, the Arab world has split asunder: embassies closed, riots started, bombs exploded. The results of the test seem heavily negative.

I knew a real religious Muslim once. He was kind, sweet, friendly, good-natured. One day, some extremist sectarians came along and chopped off his head. Blood is more visible than sweet nothings.
