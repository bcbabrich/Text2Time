To the Editor:

The increasingly fervent claims of one or another of the presidential candidates that they are ''the true believers'' in one religious group or another and the increasingly frenetic claims of all of the presidential candidates to having a personal relationship with God are disturbing, to say the least (Week in Review, Feb. 27).

Some candidates are for the political aims of some religious groups, and some are against leaders of religious groups. Some are for ''life'' and some are for ''choice.'' I recommend they all show me through their actions that they have religious beliefs that show their commitment to provide for the common welfare of all peoples.
