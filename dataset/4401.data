Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said today that it had formed a subsidiary, Power TV, that would take on the Microsoft Corporation in developing the operating system software for interactive television.

The Oracle Corporation and Sybase Inc., both data base software companies with multimedia projects under development, and Scala Inc., a producer of tools for the creation of multimedia titles, said they had begun to create versions of their programs to run with the Power TV operating system. That system will be used in cable television, telephone and satellite systems to process the colors, video, audio and data that will be essential elements of future multimedia applications.

"The formation of Power TV underscores the significance we place on the interactive television market," James F. McDonald, president and chief executive of Scientific-Atlanta, said in a statement. "Our intent is to create a 'best of breed' open solution that the rest of the industry can take advantage of when delivering interactive multimedia programs to consumers," he said. Based in Norcross, Ga., Scientific-Atlanta is a leading producer of cable television equipment.

Power TV, based in Cupertino, Calif., intends to license its operating system to other makers of home communications terminals, known as set-top boxes. The company will provide a direct competitor to the interactive TV operating system widely reported to be under development by Microsoft. Analysts say Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer industry leaves the makers of set-top devices nervous and receptive to alternatives.
