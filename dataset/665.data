TIMES INSIDER — It’s hot outside. You want to be either poolside or, lacking a pool, somewhere in air-conditioning with a cool beverage and a crossword puzzle. So let’s get to it: We have four puzzles that may or may not take your mind off the heat.

First up is a 2012 reminder by Mark Diehl that August is the eighth month of the year. Don’t see it yet? Keep staring at that grid. Sooner or later, it will pop out at you.

If that’s not enough of a reminder, we have a 2007 puzzle by Peter A. Collins that will help you count off the months, as long as you don’t let the creature at 36 Across get you first.

You don’t need to be reminded that it’s hot outside, but there are other kinds of hot things. Try this 2010 puzzle by Paula Gamache and see if you can get them all.

Finally, you might be tempted at this point in the summer to just take the plunge into any body of water you see. Solve this 2006 puzzle by Dave Mackey to cool off, but make sure you have a good alibi.

Are you still feeling the heat? Let’s dance it off until the next edition of Times Insider:
