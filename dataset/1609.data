It was just a little bantering between friends, but the text messages Cliff Lee exchanged Tuesday with Ian Kinsler provided a glimpse into the bidding for his services, which are set to intensify next week at baseball’s winter meetings.

Kinsler, who was Lee’s teammate on the Texas Rangers for the final four months of last season, told a Dallas radio station that he exchanged text messages with Lee while a contingent of Rangers executives was visiting the star pitcher at his Arkansas home.

“I was like, ‘Well, just sign whatever they give you,’ ” Kinsler said in the interview on KESN-FM. “He said: ‘Let’s see what happens. We have to wait it out.’ ” Kinsler said he told Lee that he enjoyed being his teammate, to which he said Lee responded, “I do, too, but we have to wait it out.’’

“I said, ‘Just sign it,’ ” Kinsler added. At that point, Kinsler said, Lee responded by sending him a photo of a deer that a friend had shot on his property.

The Rangers have met with Lee twice and want to re-sign him. But the Yankees, with their financial might, are considered the favorites.
