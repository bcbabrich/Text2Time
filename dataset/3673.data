Reversing years of declining support, United Way of Tri-State will report today that it raised $103 million in the last year, up 4.5 percent over the previous year after adjusting for inflation, the first real increase in this decade.

The growth is the first since United Way of America was rocked by a scandal six years ago that sent its president to prison for stealing charity funds and the local United Ways saw their support drop. Donations have also suffered from downsizing at major corporations, slow wage growth and less interest in giving to health and human services agencies.

Even with the increase, contributions by the 137 large companies and their workers in the New York metropolitan region that give through Tri-State is still 15 percent below the 1991-92 figure, when pledges totaled $121.4 million, adjusted for inflation as are all figures reported here.

The increase in pledges should translate into small increases in allocations in the next 12 months to many of the health and human services agencies that depend on United Way for support. Typically about 6 percent of pledges are not fulfilled, often because people switch jobs.
