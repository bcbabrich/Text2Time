THE TELEVISION SCRIPT Narrator: Bob Abrams. His record squeaky clean. His reputation beyond reproach. But Al D'Amato. Scandal after scandal. Housing grants for his friends. Contracts for his contributors. And backroom deals for his brother. A Senate ethics investigation concluded D'Amato allowed his office to be systematically misused for personal gain. Now D'Amato is attacking Bob Abrams' integrity? Come on, Al! Who do you think you're kidding? PRODUCER: Struble-Totten of Washington. ON THE SCREEN: Narration over a color picture of Abrams with newspaper mastheads and headlines. Black-and-white picture of Mr. D'Amato against an ominous-looking etching of the United States Capitol. Photograph of Mr. D'Amato with quotations from a Senate Ethics Committee report. Photograph of Mr. D'Amato with headlines of negative stories about him. Full-frame photograph of Mr. D'Amato for the final narration. ACCURACY: The statements referring to Mr. Abrams were taken from opinions on the editorial pages of the Buffalo News and the Troy Record. The quotations themselves are correct. "Scandal" is, of course, a word subject to interpretation -- it is indeed true that friends of Mr. D'Amato's, as well as his cousin, have gotten housing grants, and that contributors, including several defense firms, have gotten government contracts after Mr. D'Amato helped them. But Mr. D'Amato routinely says he helps all New Yorkers, whether they support him or not, and he has not been convicted of any crime. The "personal gain" cited in a Senate Ethics Committee investigation was not Mr. D'Amato's, but his brother's: the committee said Senator D'Amato had "conducted the business of his office in an improper and inappropriate manner" by allowing the brother, Armand, to use his office and official stationery for lobbying work on behalf of a client who was seeking a defense contract. The committee did not substantiate other allegations of improper influence on the Senator's part, although it said its investigation was hampered because about half its witnesses refused to testify after pleading Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. SCORECARD: This ad is the Abrams campaign's response to recent D'Amato commercials that accused him of improper fundraising practices. The "Come on, Al" line at the end evokes the "Really, Bob!" conclusion of one D'Amato ad that mocks Mr. Abrams's claims of integrity. The ad will probably quiet fears of some Abrams supporters that the Democratic candidate was not fighting back and was allowing Mr. D'Amato to define him to voters. But it carries risks as well: for one thing, it reinforces the notion that somebody is out there criticizing Mr. Abrams on ethical grounds. And as with most negative ads, it gives free air time to the opponent: it is Mr. D'Amato whose face is on the screen during most of the commercial.
