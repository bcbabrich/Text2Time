If you followed the social media accounts of the tennis players Serena Williams, Stan Wawrinka and Garbiñe Muguruza, all in New York for the 2018 U.S. Open, you might have noticed a certain similarity to a few of their Instagram posts or tweets.

All are staying in Manhattan hotels that they seem eager to promote.

Responsible for their own expenses, tennis players have discovered a way to subsidize and earn money from their sleep, striking deals with hotels to mention where they are staying in social media, and sometimes making other appearances, in exchange for free rooms and discounts.

Social media is the primary avenue for promotion, with players often required to post how much they are enjoying their stay, much the way that other so-called “influencers” do for hotels and resorts around the world.

In addition, several New York hotels put out news releases naming that players who are staying within their walls during the competition.
