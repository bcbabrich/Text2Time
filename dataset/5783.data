Hugh Millen, the University of Washington quarterback, was hospitalized and was administered antibiotics intravenously the two days before the Huskies defeated U.C.L.A., 21-14, Saturday, team officials revealed yesterday.

Millen, who completed 19 of 27 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown, was hospitalized Thursday night with an infected left knee. Millen said his condition wasn't announced to avoid concern by his teammates. . . . Keith Byars, Ohio State's all-America tailback, who missed the first three games with broken bone in his right foot, has had his cast removed. However, it doubtful whether he would be able play Saturday against Illinois.
