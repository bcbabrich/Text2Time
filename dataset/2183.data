Encyclopedia Hanasiana offer a very simple diagram that is funnier and smarter than anything the Bagger has said all season, which is not a very high bar, but still. We all know Philip Seymour Hoffman is a lock, but no one can articulate why. Jim Hanas explains it all with one little graphic and a bit of annotation:

It used to be that to win an Oscar, you had to play someone handicapped. That all changed last year when playing famous proved to be Oscar gold, with Jamie Foxx and Cate Blanchett bagging statuettes for portraying Ray Charles and Katharine Hepburn, respectively. That trend continues—five of this year’s 20 actor nominees earned nods for portraying famous personages—but playing gay is coming on strong. With trends colliding, almost half of this year’s nominations went to portrayals of people who are famous and/or gay. Consulting the diagram below, I don’t see how Philip Seymour Hoffman can possibly lose.
