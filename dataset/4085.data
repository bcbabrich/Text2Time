Asterix the Gaul, the French comic-strip hero whose adventures, translated into 77 languages, have made him the most popular French protagonist ever, is the theme of an exhibition at the Musee National des Arts et Traditions Populaires in Paris that runs through April 21.

''They Are All Crazy . . . About Asterix!'' leads visitors on an ethnological and historical tour of Asterix's world as it looks in the comic strip and as it really was back in 50 B.C. in Roman-occupied Gaul, where the character was placed by its creators, Albert Uderzo and Rene Goscinny.

Gallic and Roman artifacts -- including trammels, plows (a Gallic invention) and Roman Legion helmets -- are displayed among blown-up excerpts from the comic strip and interactive video games based on Asterix's adventures. A model of Asterix's village is displayed beside a reproduction of a typical Gallic farmhouse. Visitors can compare the cauldron in which the druid Panoramix prepares the magic potion that gives villagers miraculous strength to original bronze cauldrons unearthed among the remains of Alesia, the Gallic stronghold held by Vercingetorix, which fell to the Romans in 52 B.C.

The drawing table and typewriter used by Goscinny, who died in 1977, and Uderzo to produce the first book about Asterix and his friends in 1961 is also featured in the exhibition, along with a huge collection of toys, games and other artifacts created in the wake of Asterix's fame.
