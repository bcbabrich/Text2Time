Your article [''Retirees, Refusing to Stand Pat, Infuse Communities,'' Jan. 25] omitted an excellent educational program that deserves mention. I am referring to the Adult Alternative University at Nassau Community College. To the best of my knowledge it is not a member of a Learning in Retirement Program, but it does offer a variety of intellectual stimulating courses for adults for a nominal fee. These courses are taught by N.C.C. faculty. I have attended several and have been excited by them all.
