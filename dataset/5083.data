Ted Shaker, executive producer for sports at CBS, saw the Schembechler clip on ESPN Saturday night and assigned aides to get permission to use it Sunday. ESPN confirmed that CBS got permission from ESPN, but admits it should not have given it. ESPN had the tape because WXYZ had transmitted it to Detroit from Kentucky through ESPN equipment. Giving Due Credit

''Channel 7 in Detroit was putting a hold on it, but they inadvertently forgot to tell us that,'' said Mike Bogad, ESPN's assignment-desk manager.

Shaker said credit was given to WXYZ at the end of the CBS basketball telecast Sunday. That was about the time Bob Lipson was leaving Charleston, S.C., to fly home to Detroit after attending a bar mitzvah.

Lipson, president of CTC Sports Inc. in West Bloomfield, Mich., produces Schembechler's television show on WXYZ and makes videotapes Michigan uses in recruiting.

He saw the Schembechler clip on CBS at the airport and called CBS to get permission to use it. When he landed, he learned that the tape was already his property. Under an agreement among WXYZ, CTC Sports and Schembechler, WXYZ sends a cameraman into the locker room after Michigan's football and basketball games to tape for CTC.

WXYZ can use portions of CTC's tapes, but only with permission of Lipson. WXYZ did not get such permission last weekend, Lipson said.

''It's our video, not WXYZ's, not CBS's, not ESPN's,'' Lipson said.

Lipson said he would probably have allowed the clip to air on WXYZ, but not on ESPN or CBS. The WXYZ sports producer, John Cwikla, said today that one of Lipson's assistants had given WXYZ permission.
