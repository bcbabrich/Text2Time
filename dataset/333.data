Jeter and Bush have lined up Citibank to help them pay for the team, which is owned by Jeffrey Loria, a New York art dealer who has often conducted fire sales of expensive talent. The club is expected to sell for about $1.3 billion, but about $400 million of that amount is debt on the team. Bush, Jeter and their fellow investors would need to raise $800 million to $900 million to cover the rest.

Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said recently that the Bush-Jeter group was not the only bidder for the Marlins, who have consistently ranked near the bottom of the major leagues in attendance and payroll. The other major bidder remaining is a group that includes Tagg Romney, the eldest son of Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. Tagg Romney has worked in marketing at Reebok and with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

If it can complete the details of its financial plan to buy the team, the Bush-Jeter group is the favorite to win the bidding because of Jeter’s prestige inside baseball and Bush’s standing in Florida.

“The team will be sold,” said a person with knowledge of the process who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. “It’s just a question of when.”

If the Marlins are sold for $1.3 billion, it will represent the second-highest price paid for a major league team, after the $2 billion paid for the Dodgers in 2012.
