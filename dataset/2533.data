Visitors can see what the view from Galileo's telescope looked like and handle rocks from the Moon and Mars at the new interactive museum exhibition ''Space: A Journey to Our Future'' at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. The exhibition, which runs through May 9, will travel to other cities, including Atlanta, Boston and St. Louis, in the next five years.

The 12,000-square-foot exhibition features re-creations of a Mars base camp and a life-size section of the Saturn V, the largest rocket ever used by NASA. You can make a simulated walk on the surface of Mars, climbing over rocky outcroppings to reach the residence modules, try out an astronaut's bunk and test the chemical composition of a Martian rock.

At other areas, you can hear a recording of the ''War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast from 1938, and view a video of Walt Disney and the rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who led the development of the Saturn V, which sent astronauts to the Moon in July 1969. There is a mockup of the launching gantry and a section of a full-size model of theSaturn V.

Interactive displays involve NASA's current and future experiments in robotics, deep-space probes, next-generation telescopes and surviving in space.
