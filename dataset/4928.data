If there's a typical letter from readers of this column, it's something like this one I recently received from a New York City resident:

''Help! I need it desperately. I am in the market for a new point-and-shoot camera to replace a Canon Sure-Shot, which was stolen last summer. I reverted to using my old, beloved Minolta Autocord, but find it somewhat cumbersome, heavy and expensive when it comes to processing.

''I have done research and am most confused. I want a zoom camera that is reliable, not too difficult to handle and which incorporates all the lastest features - although I am confident that a week after I make my purchase, several new models will be in the stores. As of now, I have narrowed the field to six cameras with a side-glance at a seventh. They are, not in order of preference:

''Minolta Freedom Zoom 90, Nikon Zoom 500, Olympus Infinity 200, 300 and 330, Pentax IQ Zoom, and a side-glance to the Olympus AZ-4 Zoom.'' The letter goes on to note the urgency of my response, since a trip to an exotic foreign locale is impending.

First of all, my ability to respond to letters asking for camera advice is limited by the number of requests for same that regularly arrive in my pathetically miniscule mailbox. Second, I have to congratulate this particular reader for the intelligence with which she went about finding cameras that seem to fit her needs. And third, I need to clear up some misconceptions about camera shopping.

Personally, I hate shopping of any sort. The process seems designed to lead one from total ignorance to total confusion. Most salespeople just make it worse. So, like many consumers, I read up on the subject of my purchase first. If the subject is cameras, I would buy magazines like Popular Photography, Photo District News or Consumers Reports to see what's out there. I'd also poll my friends who have cameras to see what they're using these days.
