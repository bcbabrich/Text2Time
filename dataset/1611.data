There’s a neat trick at work in Joe Krozel’s puzzle: using the same clues for consecutive entries. He does this three times at the top, in the middle and at the bottom.

Much like yesterday’s puzzle, all these “givens” in the grid considerably restrict what can be done with the fill. Again, the results mostly belie that difficulty.

At 31 and 32 Down, ARTEL and BAHA’I aren’t the most mainstream entries, but they should be familiar enough crossword fodder for many. WOTAN, across the way, is a bit more obscure unless, of course, you’re a fan of Wagner’s Ring Cycle.

Down below, extra credit goes to all who filled in NYASA and GOLGI without using all the crossers. Camillo Golgi was an Italian cytologist whose name has been lent to several microscopical methods and types of cells. He was mentioned just this week in The Times (last paragraph).

Before I hand things over to Mr. Krozel, I’ll acknowledge a slight case of theme greediness. After finishing my solve, I went back to analyze the pairs of like-clued entries, hoping to find different parts of speech for each pair. It did happen in four cases, which I particularly appreciated. For example, “Mean” was a noun for AVERAGE and a verb for SIGNIFY. Of course, asking the puzzle to do that for all nine pairs, on top of what it has already accomplished, would be an adjective for “Mean” — inhuman.

Notes From Joe Krozel

I got the idea for today’s crossword from this puzzle by Matt Ginsberg in which pairs of 7-letter entries were anagrams of each other (I even used a similar grid layout). But more than that, I have Matt to thank for something else that made today’s puzzle possible; Matt had assembled a word database that he generously shared with his fellow constructors. Within that database is a feature that cross-references entries of the same length that have been clued with the exact same verbiage. So I scoured that list and manually extracted as many 7-letter entries that fit that description.

Finally, some solvers have remarked that constructors try to misdirect them by using clues that have two meanings … I suppose I’ve been caught red-handed!
