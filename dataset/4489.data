Look, anything with elastomeric fins and grips has to be worth a few extra cents.

Those features are the key elements on the Gillette Company's latest shaver -- make that "shaving system" -- for men that was announced yesterday, the Sensor Excel.

The new product is available in Europe and Canada and will be sold elsewhere in the world, including the United States, as soon as officials of the company measure its success.

For Gillette, the Sensor Excel represents the latest shaving technology, following the wildly successful Sensor System, which began shearing men in 1990. The new product was tested by more than 5,800 men, whose responses that its soft fins near the blades contributed to smoother shaves convinced Gillette that it could charge about $4 for the product, about 15 percent higher than the Sensor.

"On the basis of testing, Sensor Excel has demonstrated to be an absolutely superior product," said Robert J. Murray, the executive vice president of Gillette's North American Group.
