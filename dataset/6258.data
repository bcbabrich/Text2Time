FORT BENNING, Ga., Oct. 1 (AP)—Lieut. James Pelosi, who drew national attention when it was disclosed that he endured more than a year of “silencing” as a cadet at West Point, was hissed by classmates today as he received his infantry officer's basic course diploma. Many members of the class of 380 were West Point graduates.

Lieutenant Pelosi of West Hempstead, LI., showed no emotion at the hissing, but walked behind the stage after receiving his diploma. He is scheduled for 12 weeks of Ranger and airborne training at Fort Benning before leaving for assignments in West Germany.
