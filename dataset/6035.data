HACKENSACK, May 2 — A former Riverdell Hospital doctor testified today at the murder trial of Dr. Mario E. Jascalevich that on the morning of Sept. 25, 1966, he saw Dr. Jascalevich attempting to revive a dying patient with an ineffective method of resuscitation.

The witness, Dr. Frank A. Grosso, said Dr. Jascalevich was pressing lightly on the patient's chest with the tips of his fingers, “which I thought was quite unusual.” He testified that the patient was blue and motionless, and that he went to the patient's bedside and offered to help, but got no response from Dr. Jascalevich.

“He just walked away and left the room,” Dr. Grosso testified.

The patient was Emma M. Arzt, who died later that day and is one of the five patients Dr. Jascalevich is accused of murdering at the hospital in Oradell in 1965 and 1966 by secretly giving them lethal doses of the drug curare.

Dr. Jascalevich is charged with killing the patients of other doctors to discredit colleagues who he thought were challenging his authority. The defense contends Dr. Jascalevich was framed with the curare charges by inept doctors seeking an explanation for the sudden deaths at the hospital that were the result of their own mistakes.
