Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.

Commander James Alden was by all accounts a resourceful and clever naval officer, talents he put to use in June 1861 as he and his ship helped establish the sprawling Union blockade against Confederate ports. Aboard his now-oddly named steamer, the South Carolina, he dropped munitions to federal troops at Fort Pickens, near Pensacola, Fla., then sailed west to join the Gulf Blockading Squadron off Louisiana. On July 2 the ship suddenly appeared off Galveston, one of the busiest ports in the South and a boom town riding a wave of cotton exports to Europe. Riding the low Gulf breakers, the South Carolina, brought to Texas President Lincoln’s Anaconda strategy: strangling the South by sea.

On paper, the situation did not seem to favor the Texans. To thwart invasion, they would have to be everywhere at once along 400 miles of bays, beaches and harbors, a Confederate state coastline second only to Florida’s in length. Yet the harsh and vast Texas coast promised anxiety to defending Texans and frustration to Union naval officers, while other obstacles — including the world’s largest barrier island, cumbersomely shallow bays, and hundreds of miles of hot, dry, impenetrable brush and cactus country that separated almost any landing beach from a valuable target — made enforcing the blockade a tall order for even the best naval force.

And, in 1861, the Union Navy was far from the best. Lincoln himself confessed to knowing “little of ships,” and he had precious few, just 70 when the war began. But a blockade alone could choke off the Confederacy from trade as well as well as alliances with Europe, plus threaten invasion, particularly of Texas. Lincoln was under immense pressure to both choke off the South’s shipping routes overseas and if it all possible to cleave Texas from the Confederacy. Northeastern business interests and politicians demanded the Anaconda strategy and retaking of Texas: If it could be cut off and captured, Texas could be both a captive source of cotton and a death knell for the Confederacy.

The Southern political leadership, including that in Austin, knew that it faced a powerful challenge in defending such a long and seemingly vulnerable coast. It had been among the first orders of business, after all, to dispatch Texans to the island of Brazos Santiago, off the mouth of the Rio Grande, to capture federal cannons and remove federal troops from the vital, if remote, harbor for the cotton trade. Texans worked feverishly through the spring to improve nearly indefensible, windswept positions at Sabine Pass, Matagorda Island, Aransas Pass and Port Isabel. Still, it would take eight to 10 companies of coastal artillery just to defend Galveston, Capt. Walter H. Stevens reported to Jefferson Davis — and in the case of invasion they would still need reinforcements.

Davis didn’t flinch: Texas and coastal defense were both vital to his grand strategy. Texas was the springboard in his vision of eventual westward expansion to the gold fields of California, as well as a source of cotton that could be easily exported across the Mexican border. But this strategy was riddled with contradictions. Even with the defense of Galveston in doubt, Davis was planning to launch the invasion of New Mexico from Texas, drawing away critical troops and materiel. The Confederate government and Austin quibbled over the cost of shore defenses and who would be responsible for manning them.

Into this gap sailed Alden and the South Carolina. Built in 1860 in Boston, the twin-screw steamer was among the fastest ships in the war, and within days it had captured 10 blockade runners. Alden armed and renamed them — including the Dart, the Shark and the Sam Houston — giving him a ready-made flotilla almost overnight. Alden hoped to use his new ships to extend the Texas blockade as far as the mouth of the Sabine River, but the new ships were much slower and too few in number, and soon shipping returned to near normal.

Alden, the South Carolina and a few support ships settled into a blockading position off Galveston. On Aug. 3, a Confederate battery at nearby San Luis Pass hit the mainsail of one of the captured ships. Alden opened fire on the offending batteries and soon the South Carolina was exchanging fire with a slew of coastal batteries. Hundreds of Galvestonians turned out to watch. One was killed. The South Carolina was struck three times, though with little damage. Fearing an imminent invasion, some frightened citizens fled to Houston, many not to return until the war’s end; in Austin, the governor considered burning the vibrant port city to the ground, just to keep it from falling into Union hands.

But the Texans — sometimes with help from the Confederate government and sometimes in spite of it — were making headway in shoring up their defenses. Coastal defense became a cause celebre across the state: the blockade drove enlistments into Texas coastal artillery units, competing for ambitious recruits with the glorious cavalry setting off towards the East. In Galveston the Third Battalion Texas Artillery composed of seven companies was organized by Maj. Joseph J. Cook, himself a professional naval officer and Annapolis graduate.

Before the end of the year, old mud forts would be fortified, armed with 18-, 24- and 32-pound guns, many of them taken from the federals at Brazos Santiago. Initially scarce, artillery companies and infantry units manned the few and truly vulnerable parts of the Texas coast. Irish dock workers manned batteries in Galveston. Infantry and artillery took up stations between San Luis Pass and Caney Creek. Heavy guns were fielded at the mouth of the Brazos, and companies were raised to defend Corpus Christi.

Still, perhaps the greatest ally the Texans had in staving off a much-feared invasion was the landscape behind them. There were only a few points along the vast coast where an invasion force could land — and these were increasingly well-defended. And beyond these islands and bay beaches lay some of the toughest country an invading force could encounter, a landscape in which yuccas grew taller than a man on horseback and where a tangle of mesquite and prickly pear would engulf an invading army on the march. Worse, 1861 was a drought year.

That meant that while the entire Texas coast was vulnerable to Lincoln’s Anaconda strategy on paper, only two places really mattered: the cotton ports at Brazos Santiago and, more importantly, Galveston. Galveston alone was shipping 194,000 bales of cotton a year, three-quarters of all Texas exports. And militarily only Galveston was close enough to rail heads that led to population centers to make an invasion there potentially fruitful for the Union. If the invasion was to come it would be there.
