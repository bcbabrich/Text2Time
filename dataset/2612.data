In the 1960's, Alexander Girard put smiling suns on the matchbooks at La Fonda del Sol, his restaurant in the Time & Life Building in New York. MÃ¡Ximo, an agent for his estate, has put the suns on cotton pillow covers. The 14-inch round pillow, which is $66 at www.maximodesign.com, (505) 245-8700, has two suns (on white and green backgrounds). The stripe on the 17-inch bolster ($52 online) adapts a Girard fabric once sold by Herman Miller. The pillow is $75 and the bolster $60 at the new Homenature, 6 Main Street, Southampton, N.Y.; (631) 287-6277.
