Only Private Terms has the breeding and the past performances to make this one of the fastest Derbys ever run. Private Terms's dam, Laughter, was among the last offspring of Bold Ruler, America's premier sire until his death at the young age of 16. So, too, was Secretariat.

Private Terms, in running the fastest Wood Memorial in that race's prestigious history, stalked the leaders and accelerated past them as his grandfather would have 30 years ago. His final time of 1:47 1/5 was much better than Secretariat's losing effort in the 1973 Wood Memorial. JOHN E. RUSSEL Hauppauge, L.I.
