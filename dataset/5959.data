Because she is suffering from senile dementia, Rita Hayworth is no longer able to care for her health and financial needs, her lawyer, Leonard H. Monroe, told a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles.

Mr. Monroe asked that he be appointed a conservator, or guardian, for the 62-year-old actress-- once publicized as a ''love goddess.''

The lawyer, who also serves as Miss Hayworth's manager, told the court that she suffers from Alzheimer's disease, a fast-developing pre-senile disorder that affects arteries of the brain and brings on loss of memory. The petition was filed Monday and a hearing was set for July 17. Mr. Monroe was in court yesterday and could not be reached by telephone.

In 1977, when Miss Hayworth was living in Newport Beach, Calif., an attempt was made to appoint a conservator for her on the ground she had become ''a chronic alcoholic.'' She moved out of the court's jurisdiction and the matter was dropped.
