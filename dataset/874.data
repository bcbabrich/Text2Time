SZAPIRO--Frances Rudow, born February 7, 1918. Beloved wife of late Josiel Szapiro; adored mother of Elinor, Miriam and Laura; and of sons-in-law Bruce, Ray and Terry. Best grandma ever of Manora, Josh and Anna. Remedial reading teacher. Created a home that was welcome hub to all, and all who entered became her family. Vibrant, joyful, irrepressibly optimistic, stoic, sharp-witted, caring, generous. Words fall short. There's no replacing her. Memorial Service at Riverside Chapel, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY on Thursday, 11:30am. Shiva following burial until 9:00pm at her home. Donations in her memory may be made to Givat Haviva or American Jewish World Service.
