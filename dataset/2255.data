And here's another one from the Bad Customer Service Files: a guy who recorded his phone call to AOL in an attempt to cancel his AOL account.

Frankly, I find the caller pretty discourteous, but the lengths to which the AOL rep went to prevent the cancellation really are pretty amazing.

(Once the call became public online, AOL issued an apology. “At AOL, we have zero-tolerance for customer care incidents like this...the employee cited here is no longer with the Company.”)

Listen up, AOL: we all know that the dial-up era is ending. Offhand, I don't know exactly what your salvation will be. But I can tell you pretty confidently that trying to argue your customers out of canceling isn't the big answer.
