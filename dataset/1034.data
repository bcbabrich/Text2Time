BILLY--William M. July 2, 1958 - August 30, 1993 20 years ago my dear friend died. 20 years without his wonderfully unique perspective on life; his very opinionated opinions on art, design, food, music, dance, theater, science, and any other aspect of the human condition you wanted to discuss; his ridiculous love of the ridiculous; his brutal honesty in calling out the phony and the false, never cruelly but not necessarily without a bite; 20 years without his happy, restless creativity that ranged from the highly profound to the highly questionable; and 20 years without his love, support, and friendship which he always gave so honestly, lovingly, and generously. Among his friends he is spoken of often and always with a smile. Sometimes I hesitate to think of what might have been but I know that it would have been wonderful. Bill McIntosh
