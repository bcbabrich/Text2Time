Prof. William Albert Niering, an internationally recognized expert on the ecology of wetlands and tidal marshes, died Monday in New London, where he had just addressed the incoming class of 2003 at Connecticut College. He was 75 and lived in Gales Ferry, Conn.

He collapsed on the campus, outside Palmer Auditorium, and was pronounced dead on arrival at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, the college said.

Dr. Niering, the Lucretia L. Allyn Professor of Botany at the school and its longest-tenured faculty member, was one of the first small group of scientists to realize that wetlands play vital ecological roles and are not something to be drained and filled in. He contributed to the understanding of the role of marshes in flood drainage, water filtration and providing a spawning habitat for fish and other ocean life.

His botanical research varied from the vegetation of Connecticut's remaining natural spaces to wetlands ecology, from the dynamics of the vegetation of Pacific atolls to the flora of the desert Southwest.
