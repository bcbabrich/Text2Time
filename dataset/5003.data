Rebels have killed about 200 foreigners in Liberia whose governments contributed soldiers to a West African force sent to end the nation's civil war, the Ghana News Agency reported today.

The agency, which has a reporter with the five-nation force, quoted witnesses as saying that the civilians, including many Ghanaians and Nigerians, were killed after the military contingent landed in Monrovia, Liberia's main port. The report could not be independently verified.

The agency quoted unidentified Ghanaians who said they escaped the attack by guerrilla forces loyal to the rebel leader, Charles Taylor, who has opposed intervention by the West African force. #3,000 Sent to End Strife About 3,000 soldiers from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia arrived in Monrovia on Aug. 25 on troop transport ships under orders to end the eight-month tribal war.

Mr. Taylor's fighters have attacked the force on several occasions.

The Ghana News Agency quoted a 36-year-old Ghanaian teacher, Kwasi Kwateng, as saying that the rebels attacked a community of 2,500 Ghanaians in Barnersville, about three miles from Monrovia's port.
