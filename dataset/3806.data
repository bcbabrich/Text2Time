On Thursday, Nov. 28, 1963, Lawrence J. Bart, a quiet, unremarkable man who worked as an executive in his family's printing business in the Flatiron District, missed Thanksgiving dinner. He had been at work the day before, and had never called to say he would not be coming. The next morning, his younger brother and a friend found him murdered in his Chelsea apartment, strangled with a dog chain, the blade of a steak knife imbedded in his chest.

Coming as it did, while the grief-stricken nation was still reeling from the Kennedy assassination six days earlier, the killing attracted fleeting attention and was quickly forgotten. But yesterday, nearly 34 years later, the police said they had cracked the case, thanks to a former prostitute who, having undergone a religious conversion and feeling burdened by guilt over her knowledge of the crime, came forward to identify the killer.

Detectives yesterday arrested Lawrence Henry, a 61-year-old father of five, at his apartment at 29 Fleet Walk in the Raymond V. Ingersoll Houses, a Fort Greene housing project. Residents described the suspect as a kindly man, popular with children, who was nicknamed ''the preacher.'' Even the woman who lived with him said she knew nothing of Mr. Henry's long criminal past, as he had not been in trouble with the law in almost a decade.

The police, however, described Mr. Henry as a former pimp with a history of arrests dating back to 1958, and said he had killed Mr. Bart because the prostitute had fallen in love with him. Mr. Henry, the police said, feared losing the woman as an employee.
