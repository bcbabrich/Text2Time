Christopher Reeve, the star of four "Superman" movies, is paralyzed and cannot breathe on his own after shattering two spinal bones in a horse-riding accident, his surgeon said today. The actor's prognosis was uncertain.

Mr. Reeve's headlong fall in a weekend equestrian competition caused multiple fractures to his first and second cervical vertebrae, bones in the spinal column near the base of his skull, said Dr. John A. Jane, his surgeon.

The injuries to his spinal cord may soon require surgery to stabilize his upper spine, the doctor said.

"The extent of the damage is not known," Dr. Jane said. "At this time, it is premature to speculate about his long-term prognosis."
