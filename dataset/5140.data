To the Editor:

''Vatican and Poland Restore Relations'' (news story, July 18) implies that previous relations ended when the last papal nuncio left Warsaw on Sept. 5, 1939, at the start of World War II. But the Vatican maintained diplomatic relations with the Polish government in exile through the war.

After the nuncio, Archbishop Filippo Cortesi, left Warsaw, the Vatican appointed Monsignor Alfredo Pacini charge d'affaires to the Polish Government, which was re-established in France. When it moved to London after the French defeat in 1940, Archbishop William Godfrey was named charge d'affaires.

The Polish Ambassador to the Holy See during the war was Kazimierz Papee, who kept the Vatican informed about conditions in occupied Poland, including the persecution of the church and the genocide of the Jews. He also made largely unsuccessful efforts to elicit a strong statement from the Pope. In 1942, Papee transmitted to Pope Pius XII letters from the Polish President, Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz, that described the extermination of the Jews as ''systematic and well nigh scientifically organized mass murder,'' and asked for ''a pronouncement clearly and explicitly pointing out the evil and condemning those who served it.''
