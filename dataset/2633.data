Thorncrown is tall and narrow, built of glass, wood and stone. Mr. Jones used a stabilizing device believed to be new at the time, crossed-wood bracing near the ceiling running most of the length of the building. Each brace is two lengths of two-by-four lumber joined by hollow steel joints that produce "a diamond fretwork of light" that creates "the illusion of infinity," Mr. Ivy writes.

One of Mr. Jones's most ambitious projects was not completed. Tom Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza, commissioned a palatial house at Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1988. Four years into the project, with construction well under way and with $3 million to $4 million already spent by Mr. Jones's estimate, Mr. Monaghan suddenly halted the project. He had just read C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" and was stricken by a chapter on greed. He shifted his attention to building a Roman Catholic college in Florida.

Mr. Jones designed 135 houses and 15 chapels and churches in 20 states from California to Massachusetts and from Florida to Colorado. Most were in Arkansas. He designed an assortment of other structures, including fountains, gardens, pavilions and commercial buildings. He once designed an auto repair shop, but the brothers who owned the business quarreled before it was built.

Besides Thorncrown, his other well-known sacred structures include the Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel in Bella Vista, Ark., and the Marty Leonard Chapel in Fort Worth.

Mr. Jones had no interest in skyscrapers, but he did drafting work on one, the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Okla., when he was apprenticed to Wright.

Euine Fay Jones was born on Jan. 31, 1921, at Pine Bluff, Ark., to Euine Fay Jones and Candy Louise Alston Jones. He grew up in El Dorado, Ark., where his parents moved to run a restaurant. As a boy he liked to draw and to build treehouses. One burned when a spark from its brick fireplace escaped. He became interested in architecture when he saw a movie short subject in 1938 on Wright's new Johnson's Wax headquarters in Racine, Wis.

He studied engineering for two and a half years at the University of Arkansas, then earned a degree in its new architecture program in 1950. He received a master's degree in 1951 at Rice University in Houston. Two years earlier at an A.I.A. convention in Houston, a chance encounter with Wright led to a lasting connection. His first Taliesin Fellowship was in 1953.
