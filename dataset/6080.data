Edward A. Garmatz, a former Representative from Maryland, was indicted by a Federal grand jury yesterday on a charge of having conspired to receive $15,000 in “unlawful gratuities” from two shipping companies while he was chair‐. man of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in the early 1970's.

The indictment by a Maryland grand jury charged that the 74‐year old Baltimore Democrat had sought the funds, and had personally received $4,000 of the $15,000, in connection with his support of legislation that was beneficial to Moore‐McCormack Lines and United States Lines.

According to the indictment, Robert McElroy, who was chief clerk of the Merchant Marine Committee, received $11,000 “for the use and benefit” of Mr. Garmatz. The $15,000, the indictment said, was paid by James R. Barker, president of Moore‐McCormack, and Edward J. Heine, president of United States Lines.

In a statement issued in Baltimore yesterday, Mr. Garmatz denied the charge “without reservation.” He said that his attorney had advised him against making any substantive comment about the indictment “at this time.”
