The evolution from the 1991's (too young and probably not too promising) through the 1990's (just beginning to open up) and the 1989's (already delicious) speaks well of these wines. At the same time, there is a certain heaviness (this may be unfair; I've been drinking Pauillacs) and an absence -- or at least a shortage -- of elegance. Rustic is a word that comes to mind. (This, too, may be unfair; I've also been drinking Leoville-Barton.)

Of course, these wines are expected to be rounder and softer than their austere cousins in the Medoc; don't they call neighboring Pomerol the Burgundy of Bordeaux? These Fronsacs readily equal some fairly well known St.-Emilions.

The Expression group includes chateaus from the two Fronsac appellations, Canon-Fronsac, which has a reputation for slightly better wines, and Fronsac itself, which surrounds Canon-Fronsac. Barrabaque, Cassagne Haut-Canon, Mazeris-Bellevue and Moulin-Pey-Labrie are in Canon-Fronsac. In this group, they showed no better and no worse than the Fronsac wines.

Expression de Fronsac is only a part of what the appellation has to order. There are more than 100 chateaus in the little Fronsac towns of Saillans, St.-Michel, St.-Aignan and Fronsac itself, some of them better known than those in the Expression group. Canon Moueix, Canon de Brem, La Dauphine, Haut-Laroque La Fleur Canon and La Riviere are names that turn up from time to time. All these properties are owned or managed by the Moueix family.

While Fronsac wines are not well known in the United States, they sell well in the Low Countries and Germany. Many of the small chateaus have thriving mail-order businesses, supplying the same customers every year. To some extent, this market isolates them from the larger Bordeaux market, which has stagnated in recent years, despite excellent vintages.

Prices are dropping fast in France, and it's likely that considerable amounts of good Bordeaux will come on the market soon at attractive prices. To compete, lesser-known areas like Fronsac, if they don't pull out of the market entirely, will have to offer very good values. There could be some interesting Fronsacs in your future. The near future. TASTINGS Pedroncelli Merlot, Sonoma County, Calif., 1989; about $10.

The Pedroncellis have been making good, moderately priced wines in the Dry Creek region of Sonoma County for 90 years, and they have always given good value. They use their own grapes and grapes purchased from neighbors and growers to the east, in the Alexander Valley. The wines are rarely blockbusters, but then, no one wants to drink big, intense wines every day. This delightful merlot is a good example of the Pedroncelli style: it isn't out to make a statement. The different varietal characteristics between merlot and cabernet sauvignon are much less pronounced in California than in Europe or on Long Island. But this wine is clearly a merlot. It has a degree of mellowness and roundness that one looks for in merlots from St.-Emilion and the other communes east of Bordeaux, where the merlot grape flourishes. It even resembles some of the easy-drinking merlots from northern Italy. It is a full-flavored wine meant to go with casual meals and meant for drinking now.
