Charges against a businessman accused of raping a woman he met over the Internet were dismissed yesterday at the request of the Manhattan District Attorney's office.

Paul Krauth, the defendant, was allowed to go free after a brief hearing in Criminal Court in lower Manhattan. Mr. Krauth had been free on bail before the hearing.

Prosecutors said they requested the dismissal after investigating the claims of the accuser and reviewing evidence in police custody, including extensive records of computer communications.

Martha Bashford, the assistant district attorney handling the case, said the matter was complicated by ''lack of candor'' on the part of the accuser, whose name was not released. Ms. Bashford said that after Mr. Krauth's arrest on Sunday, prosecutors were able to review computer communications between the suspect and the accuser and a message the woman left on Mr. Krauth's answering machine.
