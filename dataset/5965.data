Relative calm prevailed at the 13th annual Heublein auction of rare wines, held recently in New Orleans, and the level of prices appeared somewhat lower than in previous years. A four-bottle case of Burgundies from the 1865 vintage brought the highest price, $8,800, or $2,200 a bottle.

This was far below the record sale price of $31,000 for a single bottle of Chateau Lafite 1822 at the Heublein auction last year in San Francisco. John Grisanti, the Memphis restaurateur who purchased that bottle, was not present at this year's auction.

The purchaser of the four Burgundies was the Midnight Sun Restaurant in Atlanta, owned by John Portman, the architect, according to a spokesman for Heublein. The Burgundies were a Chambertin, a Beaune Premiere, a Clos-Vougeot and a Volnay-Santenots, all bearing the labels of Bouchard Pere & Fils, a prominent Burgundy shipper whose wines are imported into the United States by Heublein.

The biggest buyer at the auction was Carl Mayhue, a beverage retailer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with total purchases of $48,676. The heavy buyers at the Heublein auction are usually restaurant owners or store owners who are seeking not only to bolster their inventories with old wines but also to generate publicity.
