If your job is to make a depressing movie about a particularly unpleasant medical condition, poverty and ruined lives, maybe you should look for a celebrity narrator. The filmmakers behind “Shout Gladi Gladi,” set in Sierra Leone and Malawi, found Meryl Streep, and her sympathy-rich voice does temper the horror and add glamour.

The subject of this thorough, powerfully straightforward documentary is fistula, essentially a hole torn between the vagina and the bladder or bowel. Women who have it are unable to control urination or defecation, and many become despised outcasts in their villages. The condition is often a result of the rape of very young girls, but here the directors, Adam Friedman and Iain Kennedy, focus on obstetric fistula.

The cause is simple: a lack of medical care. In the West, if there were problems delivering a baby, “you’d just automatically have a C-section,” says one of the talking heads. (Others include Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian activist playwright and Nobel laureate, and the philanthropist Melinda Gates.) But there is often no one to perform a cesarean, and fistula is a common consequence.

“Shout Gladi Gladi,” named for a celebration held after women complete treatment to repair their fistulas, looks at both the dire situation and efforts to change it, led by Ann Gloag, a Scottish transportation mogul. The camera doesn’t turn away when babies are born, even when something goes wrong.
