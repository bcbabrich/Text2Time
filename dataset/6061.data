After outlining American plans to promote Africa's economic growth, he said “while we address the reality of human need in Africa, we must also do what we can in behalf of human justice there.”

He said that the United States would be “firm in our support of individual human rights” everywhere. “Our concern is not limited to any one region of the continent.”

Mr. Vance applauded the recent decision of the Commonwealth countries to condemn the “massive violation of human rights” in Uganda. He said “abuse of human rights is wrong on any grounds; it is particularly offensive when it is on the basis of race,” a reference to the situation in Rhodesia and South Africa.

Regarding Rhodesia, where the Government of Prime Minister Ian D. Smith is under pressure to agree to a British—American formula leading to a majority rule next year, Mr. Vance said “the choice between negotiated settlement and violent solution must be made now.”

“The same is true for Namibia,” Mr. Vance said, “Many lives—black and white—hang in the balance.”

Namibia is the African name for SouthWest Africa, an area controlled by South Africa. Negotiations are now under way on a formula allowing for a transition to independence under United Nations auspices.

As to South Africa itself, Mr. Vance said “violence within South Africa grows.” He said there may be more time there for people of good will to achieve a solution ‘'but progress must soon be made, or good will could be lost.”

Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, seeking South African support for solutions in Rhodesia and South‐West Africa tended to avoid exerting pressure for change in South Africa itself, but Mr. Vance, justifying the Carter Administration's decision to do so, said:

“Some have argued that apartheid in South Africa should be ignored for the time being, in order to concentrate on achieving progress on Rhodesia and Namibia. Such a policy would be wrong and would not work. It would be blind to the reality that the beginning of progress must be made soon within South Africa, if there is to be a possibility of peaceful solutions in the longer run. It could mislead the South Africans about our real concerns. It would prejudice our relations with our African friends. It would do a disservice to our own beliefs. And it would discourage those of all races who are working for peaceful progress within South Africa.”
