Ashley Gilbertson has taken photographs in emergency rooms throughout the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. But what he saw during the week he spent in the Maimonides Medical Center emergency room in Brooklyn shocked him.

“I’m used to seeing people being taken from an E.R. to the morgue, sometimes because of a lack of technology, education or even electricity” Mr. Gilbertson said. “ I had never seen people brought back to life on a regular basis. It was so beautiful, so powerful, but for the doctors and nurses it was just another day in their life.”

The photographs that Mr. Gilbertson made of the “whole human experience in one relatively small room in Brooklyn” accompany an article by Lizette Alvarez and a video by Mathew Orr and Ms. Alvarez on Sunday in the Metropolitan section of The Times.

Ashley Gilbertson, a New York-based photojournalist with the VII Network Photo Agency, documents the effects of war. In March, “Bedrooms of The Fallen,” depicting the bedrooms of service members who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, was featured on Lens. In July, he wrote about his experiences photographing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s hot line for veterans.
