To the Editor:

Tom Boasberg recognizes the quality of the New York City Department of Health's AIDS prevention efforts (Op-Ed, July 11), but presents an inadequate impression of the quantity and impact of our work.

Each month, the department counsels more than 8,000 individuals through our telephone hotline service; trains 3,000 professionals in risk-reduction education, and educates more than 10,000 people through our community-based programs. The city contracts with community-based organizations for more than $1 million of additional outreach services and distributes more than 1 million pieces of printed information each month.

Counseling and testing are at city-and state-run facilities and through private physicians, with laboratory services provided free by the city. Each day our media efforts reach countless New Yorkers, the most recent campaign emphasizing condom use on television, radio and in print.

To prevent further spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, funding education is not the only issue. Our ability to reach more people is hindered by reluctance of some in the media to air our campaigns to educate the public about preventing the spread of infection. The inextricable relationship between AIDS and intravenous-drug use also calls for the rapid expansion of state and federally funded drug-treatment services; this is the key to the future course of the epidemic in New York City. STEPHEN C. JOSEPH, M.D. Commissioner of Health New York, July 16, 1987
