As protesters rally around the country in support of citizenship for undocumented workers, a different group of immigrants and their descendents sat quietly at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor seeking the G.O.P. presidential nomination, walked a careful line while addressing immigration before the Latino Coalition’s Small Business Economic Conference.

He called for a database to identify all immigrants, a border fence, a better system of law enforcement and “laws that make sense.”

“If you have 12 million people, to 13 to 14 to 15 million that are here illegally, it is much easier for terrorists and drug dealers to hide,” he said. “It’s like a needle in a haystack.”

He proposed that undocumented workers could “come forward, if they’re working, and they’re compliant with the law, and they’re making a contribution, then let’s sign ‘em up, let’s register them, let’s collect their taxes, and let’s make them pay their fair share.”

Mr. Giuliani said illegal immigrants should ultimately be eligible for citizenship.

“We need a sensible solution to this, not a one issue solution,” he said, in an apparent critique of the enforcement-only approach popular with a major segment of his party, which is divided on the issue. “If we do a one-issue solution, we’re going to be in much greater danger.”

In drawing a distinction between illegal immigrants here in the country to work and those here to make trouble, he cited his mayoral experience in New York where he asked the Immigration and Naturalization Service to focus on deporting drug dealers rather than a professor who overstayed his visa and a myriad of other illegal workers.

“And I would say, oh, ok, all right, this is maybe good, maybe bad, you can have a big debate about all this, is this good for our economy? I think it is, some people think it isn’t, that’s is a nice debate we can have. You’ve got drug dealers, pal,” he said to laughter. “They’re no good for anybody.”

According to Robert G. de Posada, president of the Latino Commission, Mr. Giuliani “hit the right tones.”

“He was able to deliver what Bush delivered over Kerry in 2004,” Mr. Posada added, “which was, ‘I know this community.’ ”

Nonetheless, he said, endorsement discussions among the board of the Latino Commission, which is ideologically to the right of the major national Hispanic groups, “is very open.”

He said that tough immigration talk is “absolutely” driving away Latinos who might otherwise vote Republican, as is a perception that the party is becoming “just another big government, big brother operation.” He added that a new trend in ticket-splitting is emerging among Hispanics.

Lucia Leonard, a member of the Latino Coalition who runs an international business development firm, identifies as a Republican and said she is more concerned about economic and trade issues than immigration. So far, she’s leaning toward Mr. Giuliani, but she questioned whether he planned to build the fence along the northern border or the southern border. “There are other ways he can accomplish the same goal,” Ms. Leonard said.
