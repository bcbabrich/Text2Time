Major institutional fund managers seem to favor European bond markets and the American dollar right now, according to a new quarterly survey by Merrill Lynch. The American bond market, with its uncertain outlook ahead, gets just a neutral nod.

The Merrill Lynch survey shows that a lot of big fund managers still hope to take advantage of the capital gains possible in European bonds as prices rise with the decline in interest rates. Yet, at the same time, they are worried enough about a rising dollar erasing their profits from abroad that they are trying to hedge this risk by loading up on dollars now.

Michael Rosenberg, the manager of international bond research at Merrill Lynch, said the survey also indicated that the dollar might be in line for a temporary fall because so many fund managers had bought the dollars they need. Dollar Could Weaken

This means that as the year draws to a close, the dollar-buying could taper off and the American currency weaken. Mr. Rosenberg noted that in nine of the last 12 years, the dollar has fallen in the last two weeks of the year in the light trading around the holidays and the closing of financial books.
