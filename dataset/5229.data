Companies

R. H. Macy bid $6.5 billion for Federated Department Stores, retail industry experts said. The offer, estimated at $71 a share, is about $200 million higher than the $68-a-share proposal made by Campeau, a Toronto developer. If Macy succeeds in its bid, the company would own the three largest department stores in New York -Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus. [ Page A1. ]
