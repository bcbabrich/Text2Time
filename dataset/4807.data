To its enormous credit, the Bolshoi Opera chose boldness over mere middlebrow prudence. After Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin" last week, the company could have continued along the same safe path with, say, "Boris Godunov" and "The Queen of Spades." Instead, on Friday night at the Metropolitan Opera House, it offered a real rarity, Rimsky-Korsakov's opera-ballet "Mlada," to be followed on Wednesday by Tchaikovsky's almost equally rare "Maid of Orleans."

Such repertory, along with younger singers less known in the West than some older Bolshoi standbys, represents a deliberate choice by the Moscow company's current leadership, in place since 1988: Aleksandr Lazarev, the artistic director and chief conductor; Boris Pokrovsky, stage director, and Valery Levental, designer. They want to rediscover lost Russian masterpieces, enliven stodgy production styles and showcase young talent.

All noble aims, but, lamentably, noble aims don't automatically translate into artistic success. Like the other two stagings presented here, this "Mlada" is a direct product of the leading troika, even though on Friday Mr. Lazarev was still fulfilling a prior commitment in Duisburg, Germany, of all unlikely places. First seen in Moscow in 1988 and presented, to acclaim, in Glasgow last summer, the production seemed a muddled failure, colorful, refreshingly unliteral but profoundly confused. If the Russians don't take their own exotica seriously, they can hardly expect Westerners to do so.

Rimsky himself called his score "cold -- like ice." On Friday it seemed more lukewarm -- like mush. The whole enterprise, score and production both, with clumsily juxtaposed elements and fussy distancing devices -- along with the inexplicable absence of supertitles, which will be used in the Bolshoi performances at Wolf Trap near Washington next week -- diluted the vibrant aspects of the piece, canceling them out in confusion.
