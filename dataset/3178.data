The early estimates prepared by the members of Congress involved in the fund's creation are, they admit, preliminary. But they agreed that the fund was structured to compensate families roughly in line with what they might expect from a court award. In cases of death and severe injury, such awards routinely exceed $1 million. ''Those kinds of numbers were clearly being contemplated,'' said one official involved in the negotiations.

The fund's framers said their aim was to offer families an avenue for relief that would be faster and more certain than litigation. But the concerns already raised about how it will operate and whom it will serve suggest it may need refining.

The emerging questions and unhappiness about the fund were, in effect, born in compromises made to achieve its passage, according to interviews with a half-dozen Republican and Democratic participants in the process.

The basic architecture of the fund was designed in less than 24 hours, with the final passages written at 4 a.m. on Friday, Sept. 21, just hours before the measure was passed by both chambers. Negotiators for both parties said the rush was driven by the demands of airline executives, who had bluntly warned that they would be out of business without immediate financial aid and protection from lawsuits.

Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt had made it clear that there would be no deal for the airlines without compensation for victims. But a disagreement about how best to construct such a system of compensation surfaced.

A plan proposed by the White House would have had all victim claims consolidated for trial in federal court in Manhattan, with the government stepping in to pay claims only after the airlines' insurance was exhausted. If victims failed to prove who was to blame for their losses, they would get nothing.

Ultimately, though, the real wrangling over the nature of the fund took place when leaders of the Senate and House met in the offices of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert on the night of Sept. 20.
