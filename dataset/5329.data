Dan Quayle did not want to do his homework.

As he flew home from campaigning in Philadelphia tonight, he was supposed to be studying his thick briefing book for the big debate next Wednesday between the Vice-Presidential contenders.

Instead, he invited reporters and cameramen up to his cabin to watch and photograph him posing, with sleeves rolled up and a serious expression, as if he was making notes on his briefing papers. Then he used his study time to amiably chat with the journalists about his hopes for the debate that has every Bush campaign booster, as poll taker Richard Wirthlin put it, ''with both fingers crossed.''

The 41-year-old Republican Senator from Indiana was asked whether this debate against Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas was the most important challenge of his dozen years in public office. ''It's very important,'' he said. ''But whether it'd be the most important or not, some would say the debates in 1976 running for Congress were important because I - that's what started me to get here.'' 'An Unedited Forum'

Mr. Quayle said that he was looking forward to ''communicating with the American people in an unedited forum.'' Paradoxically, the Senator's ''handlers,'' as people outside the campaign call them, have largely kept the him away from the press and tried to have him follow careful scripts.
