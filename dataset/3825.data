His contribution is a plywood cut-out figure of a striding man who represents the Janus face of the art world. The figure, ''Artist/Collector,'' is double-sided. The collector side is a man in a suit, with a determined look on his face. He holds a painting under his arm, and between his fingers is a fat cigar that emits plastic-foam puffs of smoke. On the flip side, the smiling artist who holds a suitcase is wearing a breezy striped shirt like the ones Picasso made his trademark. The composite figure consists of several pieces hinged together, so that it can easily come apart and be stored in the case.

The work by Mr. Morosan, who lives in Manhattan but has a studio in Jersey City, is the meditative opposite of Mr. Barrell's. ''Dogs Don't Watch TV'' is a partly open case lined with shredded paper, and among the contents are a white shirt and a cap bearing the likeness of a large dog of undeterminable breed. But the work's focus is several framed drawings of the dog pondering various pieces of modern art. In one of the best, the dog stares at an abstract sculpture that looks very much like his own pointy ears. The actual abstract sculpture in the show was shipped from Detroit by Bob Sestok. It's a trunk standing open and on end with several red panels bolted onto it; the resulting sculpture suggests a cardboard box with all its flaps out.

Karen Shaw from Islip, Long Island, and Nancy Cohen from Jersey City have fashioned pieces whose contents stretch far beyond the limits of their suitcases. Ms. Shaw's study in circularity, ''The Great Escape,'' uses a hatbox equipped with wheels from a skateboard. Emerging from the box are two springlike forms: one is large and covered with gold foil; nesting in its coils is a more slender spring, reminiscent of a Slinky toy. The springs extend to a distant wall of the gallery, and the spot where they end is covered by a large, wide-brimmed straw hat. If Ms. Shaw projects insouciance, Ms. Cohen turns nostalgic with ''Trousseau.'' Her overnight case is from her grandmother's attic, and out of it comes a long necklace that ascends to the ceiling.

Kurt Novak, who lives in Manhattan, travels to other dimensions with his daft but appealing ''Transmigration of Souls.'' From his suitcase, lined with red satin, shoot out several Mason jars strung on taut lengths of twine. Each jar is stuffed with the sole of a different type of shoe.

The only fixed, recognizable destination alluded to in the exhibition is ''Rockies From the Air,'' by another Manhattanite, Mimi Gross. The pitch-black inside of her case is the backdrop for many jagged yellow lines, the craggy contours of the mountains. Josie McKee's ''Suitcase Boy'' presents a small figure in a top hat, reminiscent of a conjuror, who stares at a small scrim painted with mountains and a bright sun. Ms. McKee, also of Manhattan, takes advantage of the firm exterior of her suitcase, which serves as a stage or platform.
