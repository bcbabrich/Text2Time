But for the generation that has come of age since the 1960's, the past - when blacks were systematically barred from voting and when the nightriders of the Ku Klux Klan enforced a terrible racial and social discipline - seems as remote as it is unbelievable.

''I am not saying that there are not prejudices and even hatred among blacks and whites,'' said Katie Gamble, president of the student council at Selma High School, who is white. ''A lot of it comes down to the young people from their parents. But black and white work together here. People think nothing of it if I go up and hug a black basketball player after a game.''

There has been a great deal of change in Selma. Since 1970, as the result of a Federal court order, the public schools have been integrated. Blacks serve on all city boards. The deputy police chief is black. Dallas County has a black State Senator and blacks and whites are enrolled together in classes at the George Corley Wallace Community College, named for the man who issued the order forbidding the march on that balmy Sunday 20 years ago.

And last summer, a black man ran, albeit unsuccessfully, for Mayor of Selma.

Today the battlegrounds of the 1960's, the iron arc of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and Brown Chapel, where civil rights protestors met and prayed, have been turned into tourist stops on the city's tour of historic places. Recently the city gave $5,000 toward the restoration of Brown Chapel, which is on a road that has been renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Street.

'A Long Way to Go'

Among some whites, there is even public contrition for past sins. Joseph T. Smitherman, the pragmatist who has been Mayor of this town since 1964, confesses that he is just as guilty in his own way as Jim Clark, the Dallas County Sheriff whose role in the Pettus Bridge melee made him a natiowide symbol of intransigence. ''Our hands are just as dirty as his,'' said Mr. Smitherman. ''He just made the mistake of being manipulated by the hard-core segregationists.''

But for many blacks in Selma, the numbers on integration of schools and public offices are only part of the story. ''There have been a lot of changes here,'' said the Rev. Frederick D. Reese, a veteran civil rights leader who, as a junior high school principal here, sought unsuccessfully last summer to unseat Mayor Smitherman. ''But we still have a long way to go. There is not a genuine type of caring. What you see, in most cases, is just surface deep.''

This is, for example, a town where nearly 1,000 white students attend two private academies that were founded, amid the tumult of desegregation, with the express purpose of excluding blacks. The Selma County Club has no black members, and until two years ago, wouldn't allow a black dance band inside. And there are still two chapters of the Elks Club, one for blacks and one for whites.
