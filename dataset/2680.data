The Democratic National Committee has raised more than $400 million, almost twice the sum raised for the 2000 presidential race, despite the new campaign finance law banning unlimited contributions. The committee's data covered January 2003 to Nov. 22. The committee raised more than $13 million last month. Glen Justice (NYT)
