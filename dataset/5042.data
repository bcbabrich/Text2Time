Mr. Grigorovich remains artistic director for the main Bolshoi company, a post he has held since 1964. He said he intended to feature one or two established figures from the Bolshoi regularly, like Nadezhda Pavlova, who is traveling with the new company, but otherwise the new company will be made up of young artists, some with no professional experience. Doing What They Want

Most of all, Mr. Grigorovich said, the troupe he formed over the summer is a bid to break away from the Soviet cultural bureaucracy and to exploit the new economic freedoms.

"We will put on real Bolshoi performances," he said, "but we will be free to do what we want. We can keep dancers or sack them if they do not suit the company because they are under contract and we pay them with our money. If we can sell ourselves, good; if not, too bad."

If nothing else, Texas A & M provided the Grigorovich company with the commercial support it desperately needed to get off the ground. Hundreds of people camped out overnight by the box office before tickets went on sale, and all but one of nine performances at the 2,500-seat Rudder Auditorium have sold out.

The company has performed "The Nutcracker" and a mixed bill called "The Best of the Bolshoi" here. After its final performance Saturday, the troupe is scheduled to go to Miami to put on the mixed bill at the Jackie Gleason Performing Arts Center from Tuesday to Friday. In New York from Dec. 19 to Dec. 30 it will perform "The Nutcracker" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

This version of Tchaikovsky's Christmas ballet has not been performed in the United States since the Bolshoi Ballet closed the old Metropolitan Opera House on a night in 1966.
