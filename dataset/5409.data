Brooklyn's Brownsville section, which has been a synonym for urban decay, has produced an innovative effort to renew housing in the Nehemiah Plan.

The effort, cited as a model for a provision of a housing bill passed yesterday by the United States Senate, has replaced an area of devastation with 700 new brick row houses for owners with low and moderate incomes. Another 250 are under construction, and the city is clearing land in neighboring East New York for construction of 1,000 units by the same sponsor.

''It was an idea whose time had come,'' said Stephen Roberson, an oragnizer for the East Brooklyn Churches, the interdenominational coalition of 55 churches that financed and sponsored the construction. ''People who were previously locked out of owning equity in this economy, now have a piece of the pie.'''

The Nehemiah Plan began after the church coalition amassed an $8 million revolving fund to finance construction. Large loans came from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, the Episcopal Church and the Lutheran Church's Missouri Synod. The local congregations taxed themselves at the rate of $12 a year for each family.
