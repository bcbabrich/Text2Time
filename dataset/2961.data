Mr. Thomas says the Democrats simply cannot handle the idea that Republicans, not Democrats, are moving to deliver a sweeping new entitlement to the nation's elderly or the idea that the Democrats are no longer running the show as the majority.

''Their biggest problem,'' he said in an interview, ''is not that the majority is fair -- and fairer than they were -- when we work our will. It is that we are the majority and they are not. And for members who were around for a long time, who came in when the Democrats were the majority, who grew up in the committee system as the majority and who expected to finish their careers as chairmen of the committees, it is a very, very frustrating time because Republicans came in and took away their birthright.''

Mr. Thomas's relationships with the Democrats, notably with Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, who would be the Ways and Means chairman if the Democrats controlled the House, have been fraying for a long time. But even some Republicans complain at times about Mr. Thomas's edge. Some textile-state Republicans sharply criticized him last week, saying he had blindsided them with changes in a trade bill.

His allies acknowledge the problem. ''He doesn't suffer fools well, and that's not to say anyone's a fool,'' said Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana. ''But I know that he knows that that's a fault of his, and that for the last couple of years he's been working on it, trying to become more tolerant in more situations.''

Mr. Thomas's temper was an issue when he sought the chairmanship in 2000, but his policy expertise and legislative skill clearly outweighed it. With the backing of J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, he won the post over a more senior Republican on the committee.
