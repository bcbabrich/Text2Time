''There's no question that Rubbia was the driving force behind the machine,'' Dr. Knapp said in a telephone interview. ''But there were a thousand people who contributed to that project. In a way it's too bad when science gets to that point. But things are still moving ahead. Young people are still able to participate and make an impact.''

Legends Recall the Individual

Team research is not really a new phenomenon, according to historians. They say the tradition dates to the ancient Greeks. But they also note that favorite tales passed down through the ages tend to ignore teamwork and emphasize lone genius.

''Eureka!'' Archimedes reportedly cried as he ran naked through the streets of Syracuse to announce the discovery of his principle of buoyancy, the idea having come to him in a flash when he first stepped into a bath.

According to Dr. Owen Gingerich, a historian at Harvard University, while some ancient ''lone'' achievements were real, others were often the result of quiet teamwork. This, he said, was undoubtedly the case with Claudius Ptolemy, known through the ages as ''the greatest astronomer of antiquity.'' Ptolemy, who lived in the 2d century in Alexandria, Egypt, wrote extensively on such subjects as astrology, mathematics, harmony, geography and astronomy.

''It's very unlikely that he did it single-handedly,'' Dr. Gingerich said.

''In many ancient cases there was cooperation,'' he added. ''But there wasn't a model for equality. Instead, if assistants were of sufficient stature they would became the giants of the next generation.''

Even such luminaries as Sir Isaac Newton - who is said to have come to his most famous insight while sitting alone under an apple tree - were constantly in contact with peers and rivals, using them as sounding boards to refine their ideas, according to Dr. Kranzberg. ''The lone guy in a lab was always a romantic fiction,'' he said. ''The Royal Society was founded in the 17th century. Newton was its president. They were always busy meeting and arguing their points.''

Rise in Joint Authorship

In the 20th century the scientific quest has increasingly been based on teamwork, according to sociologists of science. One sign, they say, is the rise in joint authorship. Scientific papers that used to have a single author now often have many, on occasion more than 100. Dr. Robert K. Merton, at Columbia University, once performed a study of journals and found that in 1920, single authors accounted for 93 percent of the papers. By 1940 this had dropped to 65 percent and by 1960 it had fallen to 26 percent.
