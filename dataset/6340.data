Sly (Sylvester) Stewart got his nickname back in the fifth grade when a ldd named Edward misspelled his name SLYvester on the black board. He started singing, playing drums and guitar when he was 4 years old with his parents at the Church of God in Christ on Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco. Before he was 5, Sly had made his first rec ord, “On the Battlefield for My Lord.” Sly's mother still sings lead in the church choir in San Francisco and also takes care of the house Sly bought for himself and his family when he was a popu lar ‐disk jockey. Sly's father accompanies the Family Stone on road tours as their manager.

By the time Sly was 18, he could play a dozen instru ments, including the violin, and had written and pro duced a song called “The Swim” which, sung by Bobby Freeman, sold one million records. “I've had groups since I was a teen‐ager,” Sly said. “They were all the same. They were never nothing. No body really wanted to get involved and I had a lot of things on my mind. That's why I went into radio—to find people devoted to get ting the message across.”

The devotion he wanted was that of a group willing to work long hours perfecting an act. The message he want ed to get across — which varied from race to getting rid of personal inhibitions to having fun—had to be felt personally by every member of the group.

“I went to disk jockey school but I knew it wasn't going to be nothing,” Sly said. “I enjoyed playing the machinery though. I got my diploma and I knew that wasn't nothing but I got a job right away. Just like that! At the beginning I didn't know what I was doing. Everything came out wrong but it came out right for the people listening, sometimes would skip the news whew it wasn't nothing. There was lots of criticism from the sta tion but my ratings were good. I almost bad carte blanche. The best thing was playing records I liked that weren't on the charts. I would also imitate Lord Buckley and I made up my own commer cials. One was for Ex‐Lax all you heard was a flush ing toilet.”

Stone in December, 1967, aft er putting together, and dis banding groups that didn't suit him. “I didn't have to look far for my brother Fred die for lead guitar, and my sister Rosie fair, velectric pi ano. They said; ‘Okay, cool.’ ” And then Sly found his cou sin Larry Graham, who plays bass, and saxophonist Jerry Martini got his cousin Gregg Errico to play drums. The group was rounded out by Cynthia Robinson, who plays cornet., She attended Vallejo Junior College in California here Sly studied theory and music composition.

Sly has arranged, written, produced and recorded the 60 songs that are heard on the four albums and five sin gles that he and the Family Stone have recorded. Residu als from these songs, plus public appearances, have made him a rich man. But he insists that music, not money, is the center of his life. Money “just gives me a lot more time to write my music,” he said.

Although many of Sly's songs have social conscious ness, they are not black whip lash, nor are they weary folk‐song‐blues. Instead, they can appeal to both black and white, short‐haired and long haired young people. They encourage do‐your‐own‐thing dignity against any establish ment—plastic or acid.
