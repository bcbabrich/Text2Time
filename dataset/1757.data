HBO HBO The number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender characters has grown in recent years on prime-time network television, but decreased on cable, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said. For its recently published “Where We Are On TV” study, the alliance reviewed 79 scripted comedies and dramas announced to air on the broadcast networks during the 2009-2010 season, and found that of 600 series regulars on these shows, 18 are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The study said that ABC has the most such characters, with 8 out of 168 total series regulars; Fox has four (including cartoon characters from “The Simpsons” and “American Dad”), NBC has three, CW has two and CBS has none. In its review of mainstream cable channels, including HBO, Showtime, Comedy Central, AMC and others, the alliance found that the number of series regulars who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender decreased this year to 25 from 32 last year. When the gay-oriented cable channels here! and Logo were accounted for, the study said, an additional 27 such characters were added to the tally.
