The flames raged almost until dawn yesterday at 558 50th Street, in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. Sirens screamed, firemen fought the blaze, police officers held back the spectators and ambulances stood by to carry away the injured. But there was no panic and hardly any anxiety, and when some fiery debris fell from the four‐story brick building there was even be a scattering of applause from the crowd. A movie was being made,

The film was “Nunzio,” and it is being produced entirely in the Bay Ridge‐Borough Park sections of Brooklyn because the writer, James Andronica, grew up there and drew on his experiences for the story. “Nunzio” is about a retarded man in his 20's who is tormented and bullied by neighborhood youths but who emerges as a hero during a fire.

That fire was being manufactured in the early hours yesterday. But it was not just a simulated fire. Under the terms of the agreement between the building's owner, the Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee—a nonprofit community organization—and Universal Pictures, which is financing the production, the film, company will pay for part of the renovation of the building and support the employment of about 40 neighborhood youths during cleanup operations.

Other youths from this low‐income area are being hired as extras or production aides for the film. And many residents who at first had reservations about the filming in their neighborhood, because of the disruptions and distractions, now say they are delighted that the effort is also being translated into money for Bay Ridge‐Borough Park.
