But such symmetry seems to be lacking in Djibouti, a small nation of 600,000 to 700,000. Djibouti is close to Yemen, a Qaeda haven. It is just north of Somalia, where groups sympathetic to Al Qaeda have been reported, and not far from Kenya, where terrorists carried out a suicide bombing at a hotel frequented by Israeli tourists last week, while trying simultaneously to shoot down an Israeli airliner. Djibouti also sits astride vital sea lanes that are being used to ship American mat√©riel to the Persian Gulf.

So it is not surprising that the Pentagon would want to deploy some 800 Special Operations forces and other troops here to strike at terrorist cells in Yemen and East Africa. It is also clear why the C.I.A. has set up shop here. The C.I.A. recently used Djibouti to mount an attack on a Qaeda operative in Yemen with a Predator drone equipped with Hellfire missiles.

What may seem surprising is that Washington allocated a mere $8.7 million in assistance for 2002 for its new ally in the war on terror. Much of the assistance is intended to upgrade the airport, now a hub for military operations. Only a small fraction is intended to meet the nation's pressing humanitarian and development needs. Djibouti, in fact, is such a low priority for assistance that the Agency for International Development, the foreign aid arm of the American government, closed its office here in the mid-1990's.

Djibouti is hardly the only case in which Washington has taken what critics say is a narrow view of how to pursue its antiterrorism campaign. In Afghanistan, for example, the United States used its warplanes and teams of Special Operations forces to topple the Taliban. But once the Taliban were driven from power, Washington did not expand and deploy the international peacekeepers in cities throughout the country, but kept them close to Kabul.

In the case of Djibouti, the country is so small that advocates of a greater civilian aid effort say Washington might accomplish much here with very little. ''It is a small country with huge problems,'' said Jorge Mejia, the head of the Unicef office in Djibouti.
