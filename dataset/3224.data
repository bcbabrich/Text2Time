Historians cast the commemorations in the context of a constant yearning among black Americans for a special day to recognize and reflect on the past. The federal holiday honoring Dr. King, first celebrated on Jan. 20, 1986, satisfied that thirst to an extent, but emancipation celebrations, which take place on various dates of the calendar, reflect a desire for an expressly African-American holiday.

Popular dates include Sept. 22, when President Lincoln issued a preliminary proclamation that served 100 days' notice of the actual signing. Others have adopted Juneteenth, a Texas state holiday celebrated on June 19 in honor of the day in 1865 when, it is said, slaves there finally received news of the proclamation.

But the Jan. 1 celebrations are the most widespread, and are particularly popular in the South, said William H. Wiggins Jr., a professor at Indiana University who wrote a book on freedom celebrations, ''O Freedom! Afro-American Emancipation Celebrations'' (The University of Tennessee Press, 1987).

''This is the granddaddy of them all,'' he said.

As they do now, churches played a role on Jan. 1, 1863, in recognizing the importance of the event, he said. The text of the proclamation sped across telegraph wires in the evening, after Lincoln had signed it with a trembling hand, and reached a church in Boston where Frederick Douglass waited among a crowd of people gathered for ''emancipation watch'' services. He immediately read the proclamation and pandemonium ensued, according to the historian John Hope Franklin.

Since then, Dr. Wiggins said, the reading of the proclamation, often in a dramatic and emotional cadence, has been a central part of the celebrations, which took hold especially in the Southeast, where slavery was most entrenched. Black Southerners who moved North after the war and in the middle of the 1900's carried the tradition with them.

The historical nuances of Lincoln's act are sometimes lost, Dr. Wiggins said. The emancipation did not immediately free a single slave. It applied only to slaves in rebellious states and exempted parts of the Confederacy that had come under Northern control.

Although historians say Lincoln personally opposed slavery, they often note his political and military motives in issuing the proclamation, which was made as the Union was suffering losses and was looking for a way to bolster its cause and crush Southern morale.
