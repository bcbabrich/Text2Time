Seinfeld, Chappelle, Haddish, Wong : We have plenty of choices when it comes to stand-up comics in the United States. But sit-down comedy, as in rakugo, a centuries-old form of Japanese comic storytelling — not so much. Katsura Sunshine, the star and director of “ Katsura Sunshine’s Rakugo ,” at New World Stages , brings the form, with buoyant humor and play fulness, Off Broadway.

The stage is adorned simply, with red and white lanterns overhead and a rectangular platform on which Mr. Sunshine kneels for the performance, in the traditional style. A typical rakugo performance consists of stories delivered with three parts: an introduction, the story proper and the punch line. But when Mr. Sunshine steps onto the stage, something about the sight doesn’t quite compute.

Starting with the Guy Fieri -style bottle-blond hair.

Mr. Sunshine, dressed in a kimono and bearing the two traditional props of the form — a fan (sensu) and a hand towel (tenugui) — was born in Toronto and is of Slovenian descent. One may enter fearing the twin terrors of cultural insensitivity and appropriation, just to find them unfounded.

Because Mr. Sunshine, whose given name is Gregory Robic , is no drive-by enthusiast. Early in the show, as if anticipating the question of authenticity, he speaks of spending two decades in Japan and of his three-year apprenticeship under the rakugo master Katsura Bunshi VI . Now, Mr. Sunshine is only the second Westerner to become a rakugo master in Japan’s history.
