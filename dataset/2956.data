The United States made no threat to pull out of the NATO force, in which 3,100 Americans participate. But Germany, an important member, has refused to participate unless the force has a United Nations mandate.

For both Britain and France, however, the greater issue was what they perceived as a threat to the integrity of the International Criminal Court, which the European Union strongly supports as a major new instrument in international justice and human rights. Seventy-four countries have signed and ratified the treaty creating the court, whose mission will be to prosecute heinous war crimes, genocide or serious human rights abuses if the governments immediately involved refuse or are unable to do so.

The court, based in The Hague, is not likely to be operational until early next year.

The court is fervently opposed by conservatives in Washington as an infringement on national sovereignty, and last May the Bush administration revoked President Clinton's signature from the treaty creating the tribunal.

The showdown this evening followed intense efforts at the United Nations, in Washington and in many capitals to resolve the issue.

In an unusual intervention, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, came to the Security Council to appeal for a solution that would not compromise the future of peacekeeping operations, which he administered for many years. ''The world cannot afford a situation in which the Security Council is deeply divided on such an important issue, which may have implications for all U.N. peace operations,'' he said.

Mr. Negroponte declared that the United States wanted to continue contributing to peacekeeping operations, but could not without immunity from potential prosecution. ''With our global responsibilities, we are and will remain a special target and cannot have our decisions second-guessed by a court whose jurisdiction we do not recognize,'' he said.

The French ambassador, Jean-David Levitte, said the American veto was ''difficult to understand in many ways.'' He and the British envoy, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, noted that American forces had operated in Bosnia despite the existence of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, under which Americans theoretically could have been prosecuted.
