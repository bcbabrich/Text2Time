The Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania has received the art collection of the modernist artist Peter Grippe, including his own works as well as art by Alexander Calder, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and others, The Allentown Morning Call reported. Grippe, a Cubist-inspired sculptor and printmaker who died in 2002, had accumulated the collection of more than 500 works in his Long Island home and studio and New York City apartment. It was donated to the museum by his wife, Florence, who had previously worked with its executive director, Greg Perry, at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. Though Grippe’s sculptures, drawings and prints form the bulk of the collection, it also includes rare items like the portfolio “21 Etchings and Poems,” which contains work by Frank O’Hara, Dylan Thomas and de Kooning. The Morning Call also said that a fund would be established for the museum in honor of Peter and Florence Grippe.
