''This hearing is about an institution and attitudes which are driving our nation's nuclear weapons program to the brink of disaster,'' said Representative Mike Synar, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Government Operations subcommittee. ''What we have here is an admission that that plant has been out of control for over 30 years.''

The Energy Department said it could not disagree. ''There's still a lot of upgrading that needs to be done,'' said Bill Kaspar, the department's manager of operations in Aiken.

The memorandum describing the accidents was written on Aug. 14, 1985, by G. C. Ridgely, a technical supervisor and physicist employed by Du Pont. Mr. Ridgely was one of 11 Du Pont scientists and engineers who, apparently in response to one such accident at Savannah River, looked at the history of the plant and ranked 30 ''incidents of greatest significance'' that occurred at the five reactors from 1957 to 1985. His memorandum summarizes each incident.

Jerry Hulman, a safety specialist with the Energy Department, said in testimony before the Congressional committees today that the department had the Du Pont team's full reports on some of the accidents but that other reports could not be found. He suggested that these ''may have been destroyed'' at Savannah River. Du Pont again declined comment.

Among the accidents summarized in the memorandum were these:

* A melting of fuel rods in the C Reactor in December 1970. The accident occurred during an attempt by technicians to start the chain reaction inside the reactor. The reactor, however, automatically shut down because, with the flow of cooling water too low, it was overheating. Instead of investigating the cause of the reactor's shutdown, the operators tried three more times, without success, to start it. The heat generated in these attempts melted the fuel assembly.

Nuclear engineers said in interviews today that the melting of fuel was a serious accident that could lead to meltdowns of the reactor core, a scenario that occurred in the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island generating station in Pennsylvania.

* The release in November 1970 of huge amounts of radiation in a room, adjacent to the K Reactor, where cooling water is filtered. Nine hundred workers subsequently spent three months in a highly contaminated environment cleaning up the radiation, the memorandum says. This accident was caused by the melting of a vital reactor component known as a source rod. The rod, made of a mixture of antimony and beryllium, is a source of neutrons to start the nuclear chain reaction. The memorandum does not say why the rod melted but does indicate that the accident was made more severe by technicians' ignoring a radiation alarm for two hours.
