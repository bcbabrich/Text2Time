JACKEE HARRY, a star of the television comedy series ''227,'' jokingly describes her cabaret act as ''New York girl makes good, goes to Hollywood, and goes crazy.'' The remark is typical of the blunt, sassy humor that runs through her show, which plays at Sweetwater's (170 Amsterdam Avenue, at 67th Street) through May 3.

Among other comic bits, Miss Harry recalls her experiences as a would-be pedicurist and does an amusing send-up of a Hispanic fortune teller giving impromptu readings between choruses of Stevie Wonder's ''Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing.''

More confident as a comedienne than as a vocalist, Miss Harry is musically comfortable singing light brassy novelties like ''Material Girl'' and ''Freeway of Love.'' The bump-and-grind, pop-soul version of Stephen Sondheim's ''Putting It Together'' that opens her show is an amusing travesty. Dramatic ballads, however, exceed her technical reach. Belting a medley of ''A House Is Not a Home'' and ''Who Can I Turn To?'' at Tuesday's late show, Miss Harry was frequently flat. Her version of Laura Nyro's ''Buy and Sell'' lacked the aura of smouldering angst that the song demands, and she failed to give ''I Am Changing,'' from ''Dreamgirls,'' a coherent dramatic shape.
