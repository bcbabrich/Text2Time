A FIRE that the New York Fire Department is calling suspicious broke out Monday night in the basement of the building that houses Nobu, at Hudson and Franklin Streets. Smoke began seeping up through the sushi bar, and the restaurant was evacuated.

Marilyn Mode, the Deputy Fire Commissioner for public information, said the fire appeared to be suspicious because it had multiple origins. There were no injuries, she said, and fire marshals were investigating.

Richard Notar, Nobu's general manager, said that the fire started at about 10:30 P.M. in the basement of the building's residential section and that about 80 people were evacuated. He said he had called about 200 people with reservations to say Nobu was closed. The earliest it could reopen is tonight, he said, pending a Health Department inspection, reconnection of gas lines and replacement of a gas meter, which melted.

Drew Nieporent, an owner, said he expected the closing to be temporary. "There was a lot of smoke, but fortunately there was no other damage," Mr. Nieporent said.
