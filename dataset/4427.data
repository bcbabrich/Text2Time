A group of former employees at Supercomputer Systems Inc. said on Saturday that they were trying to raise $20 million to $30 million to save the company.

Supercomputer Systems, based in Eau Claire, Wis., closed operations last Monday after it lost financing from I.B.M..

The group is working separately from Steve S. Chen, the company's founder who started it in 1988 after leaving Cray Research Inc. At a news conference last week, Mr. Chen said he had a working prototype that was the world's fastest single-processor computer.

The International Business Machines Corporation had originally planned to market the Supercomputer Systems machine, but on Tuesday it plans to introduce an alternative supercomputer technology developed by a group of its own engineers. That system, to be called SP-1, chains together up to 64 microprocessors to reach supercomputer speeds.
