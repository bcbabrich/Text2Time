''If it was the 99th year or the 101st year, it would still be the most important thing of the year for me,'' he said. ''The centennial doesn't change the importance for the team or for me as an athlete.''

Armstrong seems to be facing a far broader array of opponents than usual. They include Jan Ullrich, 29, a German who twice finished second to Armstrong; Joseba Beloki, 29, a Spaniard, once second, twice third; Santiago Botero, 30, a Colombian who was fourth last year and won the first long time trial, with Armstrong second; Levi Leipheimer, 29, an American who was eighth last year; and Christophe Moreau, 32, a Frenchman who was nowhere last year after a series of crashes forced him to retire from the race.

Armstrong has dominated them all before and they may be intimidated by him. Intimidated riders tend to shoot for an attainable second or third place, not first.

Somewhat in the same state is Tyler Hamilton, 32, an American who helped Armstrong win three Tours as part of the Postal Service team. Hamilton joined the CSC team from Denmark last year, finished second in the Giro d'Italia despite a broken shoulder and then 15th in the Tour while still injured.

A strong climber and time-trialer, Hamilton nevertheless may not be able to overcome his respect for Armstrong to become a true rival.

These are all men in or close to their 30's, like Armstrong, who turns 32 in September. What of the younger riders? At the top of the class are two Spaniards, Iban Mayo, 25, and Francisco Mancebo, 27, each coming off a strong spring. A tad older is Aitor Gonzalez, 28, another Spaniard and winner of the last Vuelta a Espa√±a.

Armstrong cited not one rider but a team, Telekom from Germany, as a threat.

''Savoldelli, Botero, Vinokourov, Nardello,'' he said. ''Put 'em all together and they can be tough. I don't think any one of them is a potential winner, but if you gave them a 15-minute breakaway, then they are potential winners.''
