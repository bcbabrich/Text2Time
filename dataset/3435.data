Israel conducted an aerial bombardment tonight of what it said were four Hezbollah guerrilla strongholds deep inside Lebanon, stung into action by a week of attacks that culminated in the killing of a general and three other Israelis in southern Lebanon earlier today.

The air strikes took the conflict away from the Israeli-Lebanon border and into the heart of Lebanon, risking an escalation of ping-pong attacks between the Israeli Army and the guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Party of God, or Hezbollah.

The heavy bombing ended a day of intense conflict in the low-level war in southern Lebanon, beginning with unsuccessful rocket attacks on northern Israel. The final catalyst for their attack, Israeli officials said, was a roadside bomb this morning that killed the four Israelis, including Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein, 36, who became the highest-ranking officer to die in southern Lebanon in 16 years.

A journalist, Ilan Roeh, 32, of Voice of Israel radio, was also among those killed. He was accompanying the general to ''see things up close,'' said his boss, Shalom Oren.
