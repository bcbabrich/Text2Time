Will the real Democrat please stand up? That is the question dominating the Democratic primary in Florida's Fourth Congressional District. That contest will be decided in a runoff Tuesday by the voters of this seaside-and-citrus region in the northeastern corner of Florida.

The incumbent is Bill Chappell Jr., a seven-term member of the House who votes consistently with the Southern conservatives who have provided President Reagan with his margin of victory in a number of Congressional votes and are thus known as ''boll weevils.''

The challenger is Reid Hughes, a wealthy businessman and environmentalist who criticizes the Reagan economic program, cuts in social programs and rapid increases in military spending.

Test of Reagan Appeal

Mr. Chappell led by a narrow margin in the first primary last month but failed to win a majority and was forced into a runoff. The outcome is being watched by political insiders in Washington and around the country because it is expected to offer a good test of the electorate's attitude toward the Reagan economic program.
