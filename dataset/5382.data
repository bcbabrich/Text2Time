A Chinese student educated in the United States has been identified by his wife as one of the demonstrators detained in China's crackdown on political dissent.

The student, Yang Wei, returned to China after receiving a masters degree in molecular biology last year from the University of Arizona. He was arrested on Jan. 11 in Shanghai after taking part in the student demonstrations there for freer speech and democracy last December.

His wife, Che Shaoli, said the family's request to visit her husband in prison was denied and ''we do not even know where he is.'' She asked that Chinese authorities release him or ''try him according to legal procedure.''

Ms. Che, who is still in the United States, said in an interview Friday that ''this kind of treatment to a returned student is frightening to all students now studying in the West.''
