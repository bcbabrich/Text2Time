The stock market as a whole just finished one of its worst quarters ever. Virtually the only companies to show gains in a period dominated by crisis in the Persian Gulf were in natural resources, particularly oil.

''It was a difficult quarter,'' said Robert S. Salomon, director of stock research with Salomon Brothers Inc. ''If people didn't realize it before, higher oil prices made many people realize that there is a recession on the way. And interests rates have not fallen as you would expect in a period of economic weakness.''
