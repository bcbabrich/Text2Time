The dollar ended little changed against most leading currencies yesterday. It initially rose to a five-week high against the yen as traders assessed the United States impact of the vote in Quebec that narrowly rejected secession from Canada, but the dollar then slipped back after the Mexican peso weakened.

"Canada helped the dollar, and Mexico held it back," said Jay Westheimer, senior currency trader with Banco di Sicilia in New York.

Concern that a Quebec vote for independence would roil Canadian financial markets made market participants wary of holding too many United States or Canadian dollars during the last few days. After the slim vote against separation, Canadian and United States markets surged yesterday morning, driving both currencies higher.

"Investors are feeling a little more comfortable about investing in North America, hence the dollar is benefiting," Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York, said during morning trading.
