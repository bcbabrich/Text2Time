To the Editor:

I read with great interest and some concern about efforts in Florida to offer parents samples of their newborn child's blood, so that if the child were later to fall victim to a violent crime, he or she could be more easily traced (news article, Jan. 27). While the asserted benefit of this policy is undeniable, we should realize that it also has the potential to become a lifelong double-edged sword.

Indeed, if extraordinary efforts are not taken to safeguard the accessibility and use of information from DNA samples, confidential information could end up in the hands of insurance companies, lending institutions, employers and even the child, who may not want to know that he or she has the genetic indicator for Alzheimer's disease or breast cancer.
