Difficulties for Young Pupils

The newsletter found evidence that mathematics homework creates ''substantial difficulties'' for younger children. ''When the Philadelphia public schools set up a homework hot line for confused children and their parents, they were deluged with telephone calls - and elementary math led the list of troubles,'' it said.

''Elementary schools surely need the regular experience of puzzling alone over math problems,'' it continued. ''But perhaps they ought to do most of this at schools so that they can get informed help when they need it. One study shows that even eighth graders can learn as much from short assignments completed in the classroom as from longer problem sets taken home.''

A major benefit of homework, the newsletter found, is that it leads to communication between parents and the school. ''With students below the high school years, homework involves more than just a child, a book and a pencil,'' it said. ''Whole households participate in one way or another.''

One study of 26 blue-collar parents by Jean Chandler and Catherine Snow of Harvard found that the parents assisted their children in ''appropriate'' ways, providing encouragement and help that the children, who were interviewed separately, described as helpful.

''Homework gave these parents a window on their children's schoolwork and sometimes led them to talk to the teacher,'' said the researchers, adding that such contacts may have improved the children's chances for success at school because ''teachers expected more of boys and girls whose parents sought them out.''

Student Attitudes Vary Widely

Not surprisingly, research on homework suggests that attitudes of students toward different types of homework vary widely. A study of Australian schools by Frank Coulter found that students completed more of their assignments when teachers made it central to the work of the course, collected it routinely, spent time reviewing it in class and wrote it down rather than announced it orally at the end of class.

The researcher also found that high school students were greatly influenced by whether they regarded the homework as useful and interesting. Social studies assignments, for example, tend to be completed more regularly than those in English.
