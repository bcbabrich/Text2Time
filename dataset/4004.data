Consumers and businesses in New York City are overcharged hundreds of millions of dollars a year because of the grip that organized crime has on the city's vital functions, from garbage collection to the wholesale food markets. Thus it is a salutary development that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his administration have begun working with Federal and local prosecutors to do something at last about a huge problem that has long been dismissed as beyond anyone's control.

Two events occurred last week that illustrate the city's new aggressive approach. First, the Mayor joined with the City Council leadership to support legislation imposing strict rules on four major wholesale produce and meat markets similar to the ones put in place last year at the Fulton Fish Market. Legislation before the Council would give the Mayor authority to require background and fingerprint checks on merchants, employees and unions at markets that generated nearly $2.6 billion in sales last year. Second, a Federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order sought by commercial garbage haulers against similar background checks and regulation in their industry.

Mr. Giuliani, who prosecuted many mob leaders when he was a United States Attorney, moved to City Hall at a time when many experts had begun to realize that prosecuting individual mobsters was not sufficient to get organized crime out of legitimate businesses. Too often, when top crime figures were indicted or convicted, they were simply replaced by others who kept the corruption going.

The first organized-crime target Mr. Giuliani went after was the Fulton Fish Market, where kickbacks and extortion were a way of life. The approach there at first led to protests and job actions that disrupted commerce, but the market appears to have returned to normal. The model of requiring background checks and regulating activities at the market was extended to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy, and the law requiring similar checks for the carting industry took effect last month.
