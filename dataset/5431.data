''I have difficulty, you know, reading a contract for a refrigerator'' is how Lewis A. Tambs, former Ambassador to Costa Rica, explained his failure to determine the legality of the Embassy's aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. He testified that ''the fact is that we in the Government have to rely upon legal counsel.'' He had assumed, he said, that ''the people [ in Washington ] who were giving the orders had sought and gotten the legal counsel'' that the aid was lawful.

The main defense in prosecutions growing out of the Iran-contra investigations is likely to be, ''The lawyers said it was legal.'' If a Government official did only what Government lawyers said he could do, can courts convict him because the lawyers turn out to be wrong? The answer must be, ''Sometimes.''

Ignorance of the law is not supposed to be an excuse, whether the ignorance is a product of blissful unawareness or counsel's bad advice. In the past, the courts have refused to accept such an ''advice of counsel'' defense. But defendants in those cases usually have been private individuals who relied on the opinions of private lawyers. While the lawyers may have been guilty of malpractice, the clients remained guilty of the crimes.

We cannot be sure whether the ''advice of lawyers'' defense would work if the defendant were a Federal official who relied on Government counsel. Until recently, the Justice Department had sole responsibility for prosecuting such officials. It would have been understandably reluctant to prosecute an official who was told by the Government's own lawyer - most often in the department itself - that what he planned to do was permissible.
