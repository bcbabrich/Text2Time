If the United States is going to intervene militarily in Haiti, it should do so soon. Prolonging the sanctions (even the new, improved version), when they are causing such hardship for ordinary Haitians while at the same time having so little impact on the renegade Government, is both cruel and indefensible.

President Clinton has spelled out why he feels the United States has a special interest in Haiti, and why the use of force to restore President Aristide is being considered. Haiti is "in our backyard," Mr. Clinton said, and it is the only country in the Western Hemisphere in which the military has seized power from an elected leader. Haiti and Cuba are the only two countries in the hemisphere that are not democratic.

President Clinton also noted that if democracy was not restored to Haiti, the United States at some point would face an enormous surge of new refugees seeking to settle here. (Keeping those refugees out has been the cornerstone of American policy to date.) Other points of special interest, according to Mr. Clinton, include the thousands of Americans who live in Haiti and the one million Haitian-Americans who live here. Finally, there is the fact that Haiti has become a staging area for drug shipments to the United States.

Mr. Clinton did not mention the important role the United States Government has played in the exploitation of the Haitian people. This has occurred through U.S. Government support -- both direct and covert -- for a series of repressive regimes, and through the long-term exploitation of cheap Haitian labor by American businesses. The U.S. has an interest in acknowledging those abuses, and in making the effort to act as a friend rather than an oppressor of the Haitian people.

The military in Haiti believes it has won its battle of the wills with the United States. "Sometimes," said an American diplomat, "the military leaders believe we were never serious about restoring Aristide, and other times they think we may have been serious but lacked the will. Either way they have felt triumphant."
