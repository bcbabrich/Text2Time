Mike Tyson apologized to Evander Holyfield yesterday for biting his opponent's ears during their bout Saturday night, saying that the prospect of losing because of a head butt by Holyfield made him react aberrantly.

''I just snapped and reacted the way many athletes have done and paid the price for it,'' he said, reading from a statement at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., the site of Saturday night's World Boxing Association heavyweight title fight. ''I couldn't tell you why I acted exactly as I did.

''For an athlete in the heat of battle to lose it is not new, but it isn't right.''

In contrast to the histrionic defense he made Saturday night after he was disqualified following the third round, Tyson offered a meek face yesterday, one day before the Nevada State Athletic Commission starts to deliberate on his punishment.

Tyson, whose right eyelid was heavily swollen, said he expected the commission to hand down a severe penalty. ''I only ask that it's not a penalty for life,'' he said.
