The ODC/San Francisco modern dance troupe clearly spent a great deal of time and money on ''Outawak,'' a spectacular, multimedia computer fable that opened on Tuesday for a week's engagement at the Joyce Theater. Dancers spill out across a set-strewn stage dressed in a variety of costumes whose bright colors give the dancers the look of Liquorice Allsorts. There are scrims and screens galore, on which are projected bridges, a church steeple, clouds and members of the cast. And ''Outawak'' is a noble attempt to create a piece for the entire family, which seems to be one mission of the ODC troupe.

The title says a great deal, however, about the level of wit in this eveninglong work, choreographed by Brenda Way and Kimi Okada to music by Paul Dresher and Bruce Barthol. ''Outawak'' was inspired by the teen-age son of one of the choreographers and by Norton Juster's ''Phantom Tollbooth,'' a children's book that shares the dance's tone of cool disengagement. The plot is familiar, and ''Outawak'' slips quickly through its points about language and learning. So it's hard to imagine the very young or the more sophisticated young audience finding the piece the solidly entertaining, and even provocative, theater experience its creators seem to be aiming for.

''Outawak'' tells the story of Cosmo, a typically tuned-out teen-ager, who falls into cyberspace and a series of misadventures in the divided city of Wak. Cosmo is quickly recruited into the B-9 squad, a group of resistance fighters seeking to make peace between the forces of Numeragua and Verbia, committed, respectively, to order and logic and to expressive passion. Along the way Cosmo meets Molly XYZ, a pretty, ferocious member of B-9, and a host of nutty characters with names like Hopping Hindsight, Nuances of Narrowness, Raging Hormone and Crippling Rigidity, several of whom resemble the parents and sisters he left behind. After many chases, arrests and melees, Cosmo discovers Balance, the key to peace, and reunites the warring factions.

Not all of this is clear. But Daniel Levi-Sanchez, who plays Cosmo, has a serenity and sweetness that acts as ballast in the storm. The cheerful, hard-working cast also included Shannon Mitchell, Kevin Ware, Patricia Jiron, Karina Richter, Damon White and Heather Tietsort in lead roles. The sets and lighting were by Alexander V. Nichols, with costumes by Barbara Bandy and Estelle Akamine. The film was by Wendy Slick, and the slide designs were by Mr. Nichols and Larry Ackerman. Live music, including rapping, was provided by the Paul Dresher Ensemble Electro-Acoustic Band.
