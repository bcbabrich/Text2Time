This year's market has been adept at defying skeptics. After shrugging off summer doldrums, stocks have made substantial gains over the last three months. The Dow has returned 9.6 percent since Sept. 30, with stocks like Philip Morris, American Express and I.B.M. posting returns above 20 percent. Even the jitters caused earlier last month by remarks by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, seem to have been forgotten as investors who continue to put money into the market after declines are rewarded. ''It has reinforced investor confidence,'' Mr. Kaufman said.

Not everybody had as much reason to celebrate, of course. Large-company stocks were the clear favorites during the year as investors sought the security and safety of well-known names in large multinational companies like Coca-Cola as protection against the whims of the economy. Small stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, fared less well after this summer's downturn. The Russell ended 1996 up 14.76 percent, to close at 362.61 -- near where it was trading in May.

The year's exuberance has made some pause and wonder. ''Investors have to be very happy,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''They're surprised, shocked and a little concerned because they didn't expect this and don't know what to make of it.''

And as they did at the end of 1995, some experts are warning investors not to expect more of the same. The last decade has blessed stocks with all the right ingredients: the slashing of interest rates and inflation, tax-cutting and the fattening of corporate profit margins, Mr. Micheletti noted, adding, ''A lot of forces behind the bull market are mature, long in tooth and unlikely to repeat.''

Still, investors may not want to make the kind of contrarian bets that have paid off in the past. While some are betting on a resurgence in smaller stocks, which showed some signs of occurring early in December, these stocks may not be outperformers in 1997.

''The economy is brutal in terms of competitiveness,'' said Thomas McManus, a strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, who cautions investors not to discount the strength of large companies, which have proved more profitable than some of their smaller counterparts.

The market's future remains murky even as yesterday's decline was a reminder of just how anxious investors are. While some forecasters say the economy could heat up enough to warrant interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, others are convinced that the economy is slowing down. ''People have been swinging back and forth on the economy,'' Mr. Kaufman said.
