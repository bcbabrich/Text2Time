J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the F.B.I., designated the Black Panthers a nationalist hate group and would soon declare them “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.” Most of the activity of his bureau’s notorious counterintelligence program (known as Cointelpro) was devoted to trying to disrupt, divide and destroy the Panthers. Hoover was particularly concerned with preventing a black “messiah” from rising within the party’s ranks and uniting blacks with white radicals on college campuses and in the antiwar movement into a potentially revolutionary force.

One of the curious things about Hoover as a historical figure is the symmetry between his paranoia and some of the grander aspirations of his adversaries. Mr. Nelson’s film is subtitled “Vanguard of the Revolution,” which is certainly how the Panthers came to envision themselves. But the revolution that unfolded in their wake was the one that took Reagan to the White House, and that has frequently taken pains to disguise its origins in racial backlash politics.

The Panthers’ own record, as Mr. Nelson shows, was a more complicated affair, and his film captures the drama of their rise and fall without sacrificing the nuances, the shifting play of strategy and tactics, means and ends, personalities and procedures. He talks to a handful of historians, journalists and law enforcement officers, but the bulk of the testimony — rousing, rueful, funny and frank — comes from within the Black Panther rank and file.

A few of those members are fairly well known, like Kathleen Cleaver, who was married to Eldridge Cleaver from 1967 to 1987, and Elaine Brown, head of the party from 1974-1977. (Ms. Brown, author of a memoir of her time in the party called “A Taste of Power,” has accused Mr. Nelson of turning “the history of the Black Panther Party into a two-dimensional palliative for white people and Negroes who are comfortable in America’s oppressive status quo.”) Mr. Newton, whose 1968 manslaughter conviction made “Free Huey” a rallying cry for the New Left, died in 1989 in a gunfight on an Oakland street. Mr. Cleaver, who left the United States in 1968 to escape arrest on attempted murder charges after a shootout with the Oakland police, and who became a conservative Republican after returning from his exile, died in 1998. Mr. Seale is not interviewed in the film. But the absence of firsthand testimony from these three leaders doesn’t limit the film’s scope. Instead, it allows us to see them through the eyes of their followers, and to see from a distance how they reflected the passions of their moment.
