This price was acceptable to the sugar producers, hut they were skeptical about the effectiveness of any international agreement, contending that none previously worked.

The industry wanted to return to the pre‐1974 price‐support program of import quotas, tariffs and, when necessary, Government purchases.

An amendment to achieve this was tacked on to the new agricultural bill and an odd alliance of Congressmen from sugar and corn‐producing states was formed to pass it.

Few of the corn‐state Congressmen had any constituents in the sugar business. But they knew that if the price of sugar could he raised above 13 cents, their corn refiners would prosper and there would he an additional use of surplus corn. The sugar Congressmen knew that high‐fructose sweeteners made from corn were a growing threat to sugar, but they needed corn‐state help and they took it.

The Administration lobbyists did pursuade Congress to include a “selfdestruct” clause in the price supportamendment that would nullify it if an international sugar agreement was reached and approved by Congress.

But Congress will not act upon the agreement signed last month in Geneva before spring at the earliest. Meanwhile, the Carter Administration wanted to keep sugar prices down and, at the same time, avoid the internationally painful chore of setting quotas for each importing country or establishing tariffs on sugar imports.

Therefore, the Agriculture Department continued to prepare for payment of subsidies to the sugar producers while it slowly went through the motions of setting up price‐support machinery. That is, until last week, when Senator Robert J. Dole, the Kansas Republican who led the fight for sugarprice supports, threatened to go to the Senate for legislation setting the quotas and tariffs, and the Administration agreed to publish them Tuesday.
