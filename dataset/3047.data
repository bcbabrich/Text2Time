If I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and computer companies like Dell Computer that build servers running Microsoft's NT operating system cannot slow the growth of the Sun Microsystems share of the server market in the first half of 2001, they may be looking at Sun's taillights for years to come.

Sun's growth rests on its position as the clear market leader in the fast-growing server segment that uses Unix operating systems. Solaris, Sun's version of Unix, has achieved the enviable reputation of being the safest choice for information managers in a wide range of business environments, much as I.B.M. hardware was in the 1960's. The Unix market, led by Sun, has been so strong that Microsoft's much ballyhooed NT system has had a far harder time than analysts projected penetrating the business computing market.

Sun gained its momentum during the late 1990's by being among the first computer companies to recognize the potential effect of the Internet. By designing server computers that bundle up to 64 processors and by working to make sure customers had access to plenty of reliable system management software, Sun vaulted past competitors like Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. Only I.B.M. now stands ahead of it in total revenue in the $60 billion worldwide server market.

So many features go into measuring a server's capabilities that comparisons are always tricky. Many analysts believe, though, that Sun's delays in rolling out its new Ultrasparc III processor have given competitors a rare window for counterattack in 2001. The new processor began appearing in smaller servers in 2000 but may not ship in Sun's top-of-the-line refrigerator-size E10000's before next summer. By then, Sun's high-end customers will have been relying on its current generation of Ultrasparc processors since 1997, ancient times in the computer world.
