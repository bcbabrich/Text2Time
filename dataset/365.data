Re “How Immigration Helps Canada,” by Jonathan Tepperman (Op-Ed, June 28):

My grandparents had no special skills when they came to this country. They were poor and uneducated. They came from Russia and Poland because their religion limited their opportunities and put them at risk of death. Their children went to public schools and universities in New York and prospered.

I would like to think that our family has been an asset to this country. The Canadian immigration system, favored by Mr. Tepperman, is rational but cold and selfish. We welcome immigrants and refugees because that is what a decent, moral society does.

We should ask those who are fleeing abuse and death not what they can do for us, but what we can do for them.

Lest Jonathan Tepperman become too smug and self-righteous in extolling Canada’s immigration policy, he would do well to examine Canada’s sins.
