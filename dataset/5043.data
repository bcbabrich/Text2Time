As many as half the nation's airline seats could be on carriers operating under the protection of bankruptcy courts within a few months if high fuel costs, falling revenues and fare discounting persist, according to Robert L. Crandall, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines.

"The airline industry in the United States today is literally going broke," Mr. Crandall, who heads the nation's largest airline, told reporters Thursday night at a dinner meeting in Dallas. "We have too many seats chasing too few customers."

In an interview, Mr. Crandall said the nation appeared to be heading into a recession that could be as severe as the worst economic downturn since World War II, the 16-month slide in 1981-82.

Mr. Crandall declined to identify the weakest carriers, but industry analysts have said that Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines might be forced to seek court protection from creditors if the industry's daunting troubles extend through the winter. Eastern Airlines is already operating in a bankruptcy reorganization.
