Later, his present lawyer, Donald Tucker, gave him $5, and the former gypsy ‐ cab driver walked through the rain alone and took the subway home to his mother's apartment at 401 West 40th Street.

At his mother's apartment Mr. Garcia received the congratulations of relatives and friends late yesterday afternoon. Before that he had been busy seeing his lawyers.

I've been straightening out my life,” he said. “My wife and I have been having trouble since 1966, and we have been separated for the last six years. I saw my wife and made arrangements for the support of my son, Jonathan David, who is 6 years old.

“She will let me visit him regularly, and my chief concern now is bringing him up right. We are going to be divorced—she is giving her consent.

“My lawyers are looking for a job for me and I am also going to welfare to see if they can help, me get a job. I have to have a job to support my son.”

As news of Mr. Garcia's acquittal cittulated yesterday through the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Street, where the case has long been a matter of considerable discussion, Mr. vanden Heuvel spoke out again on the subject.

“I've been pleading for months for this trial to take place,” he said.

It's an injustice, he said, “to keep anyone in detention for more than 90 days without a trial.”
