At one point this season, the Madison Square Garden fans were busy chanting for the team to re-sign forward Sean Avery. But now, with Avery out for the season with a lacerated spleen and the Rangers’ playoff lives seemingly resting on the shoulders of captain Jaromir Jagr and goalie Henrik Lundqvist, the free agent the Garden fans are showering with attention is Jagr.

He was greeted in warmups with signs saying, “Come Back J.J.” and fans chanted his name throughout the game. While Jagr brushed off all talk of his future after the game, even his teammates admitted it meant something.

“I think it means a lot,” said center Brandon Dubinsky. “It’s a good feeling when you have your home crowd behind you and they let you know how much they appreciate you. It was nice to hear our fans acknowledge him and what he’s contributed and what he’s continuing to contribute. I think it feels good for him and feels good for the rest of us too.”



Jagr scored the biggest goal of the season in the second period, the first goal of the game and the one that spelled the end for Pittsburgh in this game. Adding to its drama, Jagr was knocked nearly cold by the shoulder of Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik just after he scored. He lay on the ice for awhile, but eventually was helped up and skated to the bench. He did not miss a shift.

“It was great,” said center Scott Gomez. “He’s definitely taken his game to another level. Every time he touched the puck, he was a threat. It’s great when your captain’s going like that. He’s been playing like that for a long time. You can tell we definitely fed off him.”

Jagr, though, rightfully shared star billing with Lundqvist, who had a spectacular game. He stopped two breakaways by Penguins star Evgeni Malkin and that is not even counting the penalty shot Malkin was awarded after a small shove from Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi. The penalty shot may have been one of the easier saves Lundqvist made because Malkin skated in so slowly and waited so long, he had almost no options by the time he took his shot. Lundqvist knocked it away with his glove.

It was Lundqvist’s second penalty-shot save of the playoffs (the first came against New Jersey’s John Madden) but this was his first shutout of the playoffs. It came at the perfect time for the Rangers, who needed perfection to stave off elimination.

As for Avery, he remains in intensive care at St. Vincent’s Hospital but the Rangers said he was improving.
