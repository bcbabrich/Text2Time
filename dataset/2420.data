Nortel Networks reported a loss of $49 million in the first quarter on higher expenses and $21 million in charges, after posting a profit of $59 million in the period a year ago. Sales rose 3.8 percent in the quarter to $2.54 billion. The filing, which was released late yesterday afternoon without comment from the company, brings the telecommunications equipment maker's financial reporting up to date for the first time since March 2004. Nortel has been through a series of delays and restatements after a financial scandal led to the dismissal of several senior executives, including its chief executive, Frank Dunn. The company is still the subject of criminal and securities investigations in both the United States and Canada. Ian Austen (NYT)
