''I think there are a number of students who would like to see Brandeis become a sectarian institution,'' Dr. Handler said, adding that the school is trying to ''improve diversity, without de-emphasizing its Jewishness.'' Reaction to Quotas

The school was largely created in 1948 by seven Boston merchants, manufacturers and lawyers, four of them immigrants without college educations. In the post-World War II years some elite American colleges still limited the number of Jewish students. The founders of Brandeis believed that Jews should sponsor a nonsectarian university open to all, just as Congregationalists had in Harvard and Yale.

At the same time, there was a concern that, after the Holocaust, the Jewish heritage be protected.

''They created Brandeis out of whole cloth, out of nothing, by grit, by desire,'' said Dr. Handler. And Jehuda Reinharz, director of Brandeis's Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry, smiled as he spoke of the audaciousness of people having ''the courage to get up and say, 'I want to start a university, and in Boston where there are already 17 universities.' ''

The university, named for the Justice Louis D. Brandeis of the Supreme Court and situated on the site of a defunct medical college 10 miles west of Boston, opened with 107 undergraduates.

It ''was able to put itself on the map so quickly,'' Mr. Reinharz said, ''because it was wise enough'' to hire brilliant European refugee and emigre scholars coming to the United States after the war. Emphasis on Science

The school's emphasis on science came about partly because of a large gift from Lewis Rosenstiel, founder of the Schenley's liquor business, to support biomedical research. The school receives $28 million a year in Federal, state and private research grants. It is planning a $41.5 million science building, financed by the Federal Department of Energy, for research in artificial intelligence.

Brandeis has spawned a wide assortment of alumni. Among them are Martin Peretz, editor of The New Republic, class of '59; the anti-war activists Abbie Hoffman, '59, and Angela Davis, '65; Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, '62; Christie Hefner, president of Playboy Enterprises, '74; and Lewis Perlmutter, a senior partner at Lazard Freres & Company, '56.
