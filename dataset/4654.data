They've been together for 15 years and have three children, but now the marriage vows taken 20 months ago on the island of Bali by MICK JAGGER and JERRY HALL are apparently coming asunder.

The Daily Mail in London printed an interview yesterday with Ms. Hall, in which she was quoted as saying: "I can confirm that Mick and I are separated and I suppose we'll get a divorce. I'm in too much pain for this to go on any longer." She is a model and is the Rolling Stone's second wife.

The newspaper said that Ms. Hall blamed CARLA BRUNI, an Italian model, for the estrangement. Ms. Bruni is 25 years younger than Mr. Jagger, who just turned 49. She has been linked in the past with Eric Clapton and Donald Trump (who recalled during an interview yesterday, "I dumped Carla for Marla").

According to The Daily Mail, Ms. Hall, who is 34, suspected that her husband and Ms. Bruni had had a rendezvous in Thailand in January, the day after Ms. Hall gave birth to the couple's third child, Georgia May Ayeesha. Their other children are Elizabeth Scarlett, who is 7 years old, and James, 6. Mr. Jagger also has a daughter, Jade, 20, from his first marriage, to Bianca Jagger, and a daughter, Karis, by Marsha Hunt. He is a grandfather, thanks to Jade Jagger, who gave birth in July to a daughter, Assisi.
