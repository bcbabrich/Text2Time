Carol Hevesi, the wife of the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, underwent surgery yesterday to replace a faulty heart valve.

Doctors operated on Mrs. Hevesi at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, and the procedure was successful, Mr. Hevesi said in a statement. ''Her doctors expect her to make a complete recovery and be healthier than she was before the procedure,'' he said.

Mr. Hevesi said that because his wife would be recovering, she would not attend the inauguration ceremonies today for the three citywide elected officials, Mr. Hevesi, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Public Advocate Mark Green.

Mrs. Hevesi has had other health problems in recent years, including a debilitating spinal injury that has often caused her intense pain.
