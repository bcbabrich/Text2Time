A gifted artist, who was a member of the New York Abstract Expressionist movement and then later in life turned to collage as a medium to create surreal works of unusual power and beauty. Lawrence Campbell wrote in Art News, ''There is a novel and unique strangeness to his work. He flirts with a language which has taken thousands of years to evolve.''
