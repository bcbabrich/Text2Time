Last fall, the racial skew in expulsion rates became a national issue after six black students in Decatur, Ill., were expelled following a brawl in the bleachers at a high school football game, and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's Rainbow/Operation PUSH Coalition filed a civil-rights lawsuit. The case was dismissed and the expulsions upheld, but the testimony showed that blacks accounted for more than 80 percent of the district's expulsions over the last four years, even though they make up less than half of the student body.

That kind of racial skew is common in several aspects of education, the study found. In all nine districts that provided statistics on academic placement by race, the study found, white students were disproportionately represented in advanced placement and gifted programs, and minority students underrepresented.

In San Francisco, the study found that blacks and Latinos make up 42 percent of the student body, but only 14 percent of those in advanced placement and gifted programs. And in Durham, N.C., where blacks and Latinos make up 62 percent of the students, they represent only 27 percent of the students in academically advanced classes. While few of the districts studied had large Asian-American populations, the Asian-American students in most districts were overrepresented in advanced classes and underrepresented among those who were disciplined.

The study asserts that the disparities amount to ''a deep pattern of institutional racism.'' But many education experts took issue with that conclusion. While the inequalities described in the study are distressing, they say, those differences, like the well-documented racial gap on test scores, do not necessarily add up to institutional racism.

''Unfortunately, we have a lot of history and evidence that schools tend to reproduce the economic and social disparities of the larger society,'' said Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve, a school reform group made up of governors and corporate executives. ''We look to schooling to be this great equalizing engine, but history hasn't been terrific on that score. Can one deny that racism persists? Of course not. But I think it's more complicated than racism alone. Obviously, class plays into this, and other factors.''
