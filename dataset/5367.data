As Mikhail S. Gorbachev delivered a televised New Year's address to the Soviet Union, President Reagan's radio speech could be heard over the Voice of America early today on short-wave radios in spite of some jamming.

According to American diplomats who monitored Mr. Reagan's broadcast here, it was audible on most of the frequencies used by Russian-language broadcasts of the Voice of America. One diplomat said that on at least two frequencies the broadcast could be easily understood. On other frequencies, the speech was drowned by static.

Listeners in Leningrad reportedly received the President's message clearly.

Mr. Reagan decided to beam his message to the Soviet Union by radio over the Voice of America after the Soviet Union rejected a White House proposal for an exchange of televised New Year's messages between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev.

Soviet spokesmen said such an exchange would be inappropriate in light of what they described as a poor state of relations between the two countries, notably over the issue of arms control.
