NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., June 1 (AP) —Pat Bradley is serving notice to everyone else entered in the $100,000 Ladies Professional Golf Association tournament that starts tomorrow at the Wykagyl Country Club that she intends to retain her title. The event has been increased to 72 holes and has a first prize of $15,000.

Miss Bradley, a fourth‐year pro now 26 years old, did not achieve her first major victory until competing here last season. At that, it took a four‐player, two‐hole sudden‐death playoff before accomplishing the feat.

“I'm ready,” said Miss Bradley before competing in today's pro‐am. “As a matter of fact, I'm playing quite well and I'm so excited. Everything is going really well. My iron and putting games are stronger. And I'm stroking the ball well. If I make a few putts, the rest of the field better watch out. I'm in the same position now as I was last year.”
