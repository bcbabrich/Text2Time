As he did most nights after work, Rafael Rodriguez drove his Dodge Ram to the gate of his driveway at 2193 University Avenue in the University Heights section of the Bronx Thursday evening, opened the lock and parked the truck behind his wife's car. He locked the gate and went in the back door of his single-family home. The police said they did not know if he saw the broken window.

"I heard shots and looked out," said Gloria Valez, who lives directly across from the Rodriguez home.

"The door opened -- she came out screaming, hysterical," Mrs. Valez said, referring to Mr. Rodriguez's wife, Carmen. "The police came quickly."

Inside the home, the police found Mr. Rodriguez, 40 years old, dead from a shot to the head.

Two gunmen had broken into the house and tied up Mrs. Rodriguez, 37, and a friend, whose identity was not disclosed, said a police spokesman, Detective Joseph Gallagher. "They were ransacking the house and there was quite a fight" when Mr. Rodriguez came through the back door, he said.
