To the Editor:

Anthony Lewis (column, Nov. 30) argues that citizens do not understand the ''dangerous breadth'' of President Bush's executive order empowering military tribunals to dispense justice to noncitizens. What seems more dangerous to me is the strange notion that protection under the Constitution somehow extends to noncitizens.

That sort of logic leads one to conclude that every person on earth is both bound and protected by the Constitution. In addition to devaluing United States citizenship, that argument makes virtually all our military actions illegal and threatens our national sovereignty.
