Houston, which had the best exhibition record among National League teams, didn't quite make it to the National League pennant playoff -- the Astros finished last -- but Pittsburgh and Atlanta, second and fourth, respectively, did.

Before anyone gets that far, the teams have to find answers to significant questions. Below is a rundown of the primary questions for each team:

AMERICAN LEAGUE

BALTIMORE ORIOLES With a healthy Glenn Davis back to bolster the offense, the Orioles turn toward their pitching, seeking three starters who can remain healthy and effective enough to start 30 games each. They didn't have one last year. Ben McDonald, Mike Mussina, Rick Sutcliffe and Bob Milacki are the most likely candidates. BOSTON RED SOX With Carlos Quintana out for at least half the season with a broken arm and broken foot, the number of players competing for five positions (three outfield spots, first base, designated hitter) has shrunk from seven to six. Butch Hobson, the new manager, would like Jack Clark, the designated hitter, and Tom Brunansky, the most likely odd man out, to work out at first base, where one of them could share time with Mo Vaughn. CLEVELAND INDIANS The neatest trick of the spring could be the Indians' convincing themselves that they can look respectable with all the young (make that low-paid) players they plan to use. Kenny Lofton in center, Reggie Jefferson at first, Jim Thome at third, perhaps Mark Lewis at short may not be proven winners, but can they be less respectable than the team that set a franchise record of 105 losses last year? DETROIT TIGERS While the hitters await a supply of bats without holes -- the better to reduce their major league high of 1,185 strikeouts last season -- Sparky Anderson searches for pitchers who will not allow the most hits and base runners in the majors. This is the time, too, for him to work with the mirrors he uses to manipulate the Tigers into the division race. MILWAUKEE BREWERS Of the 13 managers who did not have their jobs a year ago, Phil Garner is the only one who enters spring training with nary a day of managerial experience on any level. The next five weeks will serve as a crash course for the former third baseman as he learns to deal with his players and hones his skills and implements his style of play. YANKEES Don Mattingly, baseball player by occupation, will try to become a magician this spring and make his disappearing production reappear. As desperately as the Yankees need to piece together a starting pitching rotation from a mass of mediocrity and find a third baseman to replace a platoon of buffoons, they have to find out if their once-mighty hitter can resurrect his potency. TORONTO BLUE JAYS While they have added the veterans Jack Morris and Dave Winfield to shore up the pitching and the hitting, the Blue Jays must decide if a couple of rookies can further improve the team. Is Derek Bell (.346 with 93 runs batted in at Syracuse) ready to join Joe Carter and Devon White in the outfield every day, and is Eddie Zosky ready to take the shortstop job away from Manny Lee? CALIFORNIA ANGELS Whitey Herzog continues to resist the temptation to trade one of his trio of talented left-handed starting pitchers, but as the team's puny offense produces little spring punch, the general manager may finally feel the need to part with Mark Langston, Chuck Finley or Jim Abbott for Ruben Sierra. If Bert Blyleven can come back from shoulder surgery, Herzog may feel more comfortable making a move. CHICAGO WHITE SOX Maybe Bo Jackson and the White Sox are fooling themselves. Reduced to the status of a mere mortal, Bo may not be able to hit balls out of the park consistently and limp around the bases. Gene Lamont, the new manager, who comes from Jim Leyland's coaching staff in Pittsburgh, is eager to find out if the real Bo can stand up and contribute to a possible division championship. KANSAS CITY ROYALS Listen to Hal McRae, in his first spring training as a manager, sing, "Getting to know you, getting to know all about you." Rather than experiment with his new players, McRae has designated Gregg Jefferies for third base, Kevin McReynolds for right field and Keith Miller for left, and now he'll find out if his decisions were sound (Wally Joyner, another newcomer, is at first). The same goes for a new starting pitcher, Mark Davis, an expensive bust as a reliever. MINNESOTA TWINS Tom Kelly is the only manager who has won two World Series in the past decade, but that won't make life any easier as he seeks a replacement for the departed World Series hero, Jack Morris. Kelly will scrutinize David West, Willie Banks, Denny Neagle, Mike Trombley, Paul Abbott and Pat Mahomes. OAKLAND ATHLETICS Bob Welch begins the spring with a bad knee, which doesn't bode well for the Athletics, who need strong comebacks from Welch and Dave Stewart on the mound and from Carney Lansford and Walt Weiss (leg injuries) on the left side of the infield. Just as important, they will look for signs that Rickey Henderson is prepared to forget about his contract and play like the 1990 Rickey Henderson. SEATTLE MARINERS Given the nasty post-trade comments emanating from San Francisco, Bill Plummer, the new manager, will hold his breath hoping that the Kevin Mitchell the Mariners acquired to hit tons of home runs in friendly American League parks behaves himself and takes his new job seriously. Plummer will also hope that speculation about the sale of the club to the Nintendo people or a move to Florida will not distract his maturing team. TEXAS RANGERS The will-they-or-won't-they talk about trading Ruben Sierra could get out of hand and distract the Rangers. If they don't want to lose the immensely talented outfielder as a free agent after the season, they should conduct their necessary business well before the season and approach the start with a settled team that has stronger starting pitching than currently inhabits the staff. NATIONAL LEAGUE

CHICAGO CUBS They have a new general manager, Larry Himes, and a new manager, Jim Lefebvre, but with the exception of Mike Morgan, they have the same broken-down bunch of pitchers. If Lefebvre can find a way to establish good health and effectiveness (the Cubs staff had the league's worst earned run average last year), the outlook for Chicago could improve. MONTREAL EXPOS Tim Wallach fervently hopes that George Canale, John Vander Wal, Eric Bullock or Arci Cianfrocco can be impressive enough to win the very vacant first base job. Otherwise, he will have to move across the infield. But that shift would probably be better for the team because young Bret Barberie would replace Wallach at third, and he hit .353 in 57 games with the Expos last year. NEW YORK METS Jeff Torborg knows he can't count on Dwight Gooden to be ready for the start of the season, but he has only a feeling that Howard Johnson will be an adequate center fielder in what is the biggest gamble of his first year as the team's manager. Johnson's successful conversion would go a long way toward improving and stabilizing the woeful Mets defense. PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES They won one more game last year than the year before, and some people already have them a dark-horse candidate for the division championship. First, they have to learn if a pair of surgically repaired starting pitchers, Ken Howell and Pat Combs, are healthy, and if a newcomer, Kyle Abbott, is ready to step into the rotation. Then they have to make sure Lenny Dykstra suffers no aftereffects of his injury-plagued season. PITTSBURGH PIRATES All they have to do is replace Bobby Bonilla. To accomplish that, they will return Orlando Merced, a platooned first baseman last season, to his more natural position of right field and shift Jeff King, following back surgery, from third to first. Those moves, however, don't guarantee that they will be able to replace Bonilla. ST. LOUIS CARDINALS Don Baylor, the new hitting coach, has the job of reigniting the bat of Andres Galarraga, the new first baseman, who batted .219 and drove in 33 runs with Montreal. But who is going to instill speed, mobility and general all-around adequate defensive ability in Pedro Guerrero, forced to move to left field by Galarraga's presence? ATLANTA BRAVES Avoiding the pitfalls of a returning pennant-winner could be the most important thing the Braves accomplish this spring. They must attend to mundane matters as well, such as finding a fifth starting pitcher from among Mike Bielecki, Pete Smith and David Nied and deciding if Mark Lemke or Jeff Treadway, or both, will play second base. CINCINNATI REDS Lou ("I don't really care if I'm liked or not") Piniella will make sure the Reds don't repeat the mistakes they made last spring in their lack of proper preparation for their effort to repeat as world champions. "We're going to work very hard and I'm going to be on top of them," the manager vowed. HOUSTON ASTROS It could take them all spring to sort through the 13 non-roster players with major league experience who are in camp. But they were brought in for specific reasons -- Pete Incaviglia, for example, to add punch to the lineup, and Doug Jones, Rob Murphy and Joe Boever to bolster the bullpen corps. Some need remedial work. "We have a program for each one of them," general manager Bill Wood says. LOS ANGELES DODGERS Darryl Strawberry at first base? Everybody else in camp seems to be getting a chance to replace the departed Eddie Murray there, so why not? The preferred candidate is Kal Daniels, but he could have as much trouble making the switch as Strawberry would. Todd Benzinger is the safety net, with rookie Eric Karros having an outside shot. SAN DIEGO PADRES Players established at one position are on the move. Craig Lefferts, a career relief pitcher, has asked for a chance to be the fifth starter because Randy Myers has bumped him from his closing role. Kurt Stillwell, who attracted little interest as a free-agent shortstop, will play second base, where he dabbled for Cincinnati in 1987. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS Seldom has a team been so eager to shed a player with Kevin Mitchell's production (109 home runs the last three years). Now the Giants will see if the pitchers they received will justify the trade by helping to improve their dreadful staff. Roger Craig, manager and tarnished pitching guru, will oversee the conversion of Bill Swift into a starter after he relieved in 71 games for Seattle last year.
