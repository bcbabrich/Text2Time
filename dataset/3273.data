The actor Leonardo DiCaprio, the star of ''Titanic,'' assumed a new role today, interviewing President Clinton about global warming for ABC News.

Mr. DiCaprio, chairman of the coming Earth Day celebration in Washington, spent 20 minutes with the president for a television special, ''Planet Earth 2000.''

''It wasn't a grilling,'' said an aide to the president, ''but he did ask the president very thoughtful questions.''

ABC News said the hourlong special would be shown in late April in connection with the 30th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22.
