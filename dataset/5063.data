''The Ravel also has some jazz elements,'' he continued. ''And in the Berlioz the trick is to make clear what the music is depicting. The last five minutes is some of the most extraordinary music ever written, and is entirely out of the mainstream of Berlioz's time. Harmony completely breaks down and there is an extremely graphic, detailed program. I'd love to do it with supertitles someday. Because after 50 minutes of music, there's the danger that listeners will just say, 'Oh, yes, here's the death scene.' It should be more than that: there's some wildly creative, dramatic music happening.''

In Mr. Wolff's view, works with a measure of complexity for the players serve a distinct purpose on a conductor's debut program.

''If the pieces are difficult,'' he explained, ''the orchestra gets focused immediately on the music, and not on the personality, temperament or age of the conductor. It's a great challenge for a conductor my age to keep the orchestra from thinking about those side issues. My feeling - and if I didn't believe this, I'd get out of the business - is that every orchestra gives you the benefit of the doubt, at first. Absolutely every one, regardless of its reputation or experience, wants you to succeed, and wants to have an inspiring time. They want that badly, and all they require is that you bring enough concentration to your work to make that happen. The moment you fail to give them that, the side issues begin to come up.'' The Season's Schedule

So far, Mr. Wolff has prevented his relative youth from becoming an issue. After his week at the Philharmonic, he will have conducted all the top five American orchestras except the Cleveland. This season he is also conducting the Toronto, Houston, Milwaukee and Baltimore orchestras, touring with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and leading the New York Philharmonic in a run of summer parks concerts. And he is returning to the National Symphony, where he spent six years as an assistant and associate conductor.

Mr. Wolff was born in 1953 in Paris, where his father was stationed as a Foreign Service officer. Later he lived in London and Washington, studied piano in Baltimore with Leon Fleischer and went to Harvard, where he studied physics, mathematics and chemistry and took piano and composition classes on the side.
