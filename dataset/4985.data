About half the people with the disease never get rid of it; the liver is chronically infected, and the hundreds of functions it performs, from producing bile to making substances that help the blood clot, are impaired. One in five people with this form of hepatitis develop cirrhosis, a scarring that in severe cases can lead to liver failure. A smaller number get liver cancer. And many suffer unrelenting fatigue.

Interferon's Side Effects

Most cases are caused by the recently identified hepatitis C virus, but about 15 percent are caused by unknown viruses, said Dr. Dienstag of Massachusetts General. He added that all patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis responded equally well to interferon.

Dr. Klein said interferon gave hepatitis patients their first hope. ''It was a terrible thing to say to a patient,'' he added. '' 'I know what you have and I know what the probable outcome is, but I have nothing to offer you.' Now you have something.''

Until now patients have been advised to get plenty of rest; to avoid alcohol, which can further damage the liver, and to hope the infection goes away on its own.

Last year, two studies involving more than 200 patients demonstrated that interferon alpha was effective in suppressing the liver infection in nearly half the patients, although nearly half of those suffered relapses and needed further treatment.

Dr. Alter said patients had not been followed long enough to determine whether the treatment would prevent cirrhosis or cancer. But he said that by suppressing the virus, ''it makes sense that you will get less scarring and less cirrhosis.''

But interferon treatment has problems of its own, researchers said. It can produce fatigue, mild to moderate hair loss and lower counts of white blood cells and platelets, leaving patients more vulnerable to infections and bleeding. Investigators are still trying to find the best dose and the best schedule to administer the drug.
