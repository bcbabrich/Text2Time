"Carlito's Way" was a hard-hitting 1993 film starring Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante, a drug dealer from East Harlem. It was written by David Koepp, whose other screenplays include "Jurassic Park," "Panic Room," "Spider-Man" and "War of the Worlds." It was directed by Brian De Palma.

"Carlito's Way: Rise to Power," a prequel, stars Jay Hernandez as a younger Carlito Brigante. It was written and directed by Michael Bregman, a producer whose only previous writing and directing credit is "Table One," a 2000 comedy about a topless bar. "Rise to Power" was released on DVD on Tuesday but also opened yesterday in theaters in New York and Los Angeles.

The plot, recounting the early days of Carlito's career, is a little unfocused. In the course of events, Carlito falls in love with a gorgeous coatroom attendant (Jaclyn DeSantis) who doesn't believe his lie that he makes a living booking musical acts. Meanwhile, Earl (Mario Van Peebles), a big-time dealer whom Carlito met in prison, decides to retire to Barbados, which means changes in the organization chart in New York.

The most interesting character is Reggie (Mtume Gant), one dealer's belligerent little brother, who has a bad habit of deliberately egregiously insulting important people. In one case, he even spits in a man's face. The only real suspense in the film is when Reggie will be killed and which character will have the honor.
