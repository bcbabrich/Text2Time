Frank P. Quattrone, a former Silicon Valley investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston, will testify in his own defense, his lead lawyer said yesterday.

Mr. Quattrone is on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges that he tried to hinder investigations by regulators into how his firm handled stock offerings.

John Keker, the defense team's lead lawyer, told the jury yesterday that they would have a chance to get to know Mr. Quattrone and hear his explanation for an e-mail message that prosecutors have said was intended to encourage First Boston employees to destroy documents sought by regulators and a grand jury.

''You will hear from Frank Quattrone,'' Mr. Keker said.

The decision to testify is a potentially dangerous one for Mr. Quattrone, lawyers said. If he takes the stand, he will be subject to questioning by prosecutors, who will try to show that he knew of the investigations under way at the time the e-mail message was sent in December 2000.
