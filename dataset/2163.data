The word famiglia in a food store's name can be problematic. Named to suggest a homemade quality to the food it sells (perhaps even using nonna's recipe), a famiglia store runs the risk of criticism if it fails to deliver authentic food. But if the food is good -- or better yet, excellent, as it is at Mia Famiglia in Millburn -- a famiglia store is the go-to place when you need to cater your own family gatherings (but don't think anyone will believe you when you try to pass off the food as a family recipe).

Mia Famiglia is the rare Italian store in that it actually resembles a store you could find in Italy. Or as owner Emanuele Licitra puts it, "When people from Italy come in here they say, 'I feel like I'm home'." That's probably because they recognize many brands as what they have in their cupboards.

Take the Strianese tomatoes. You've probably never heard of Strianese, but as Mr. Licitra explains, you may want to try them, not only because they are less expensive than San Marzano tomatoes (which he also sells) but because these dark tomatoes taste the way tomatoes used to 40 years ago. Some highlights of the hard-to-find imports include squid-ink spaghetti, 12-year-old balsamic vinegar, truffle cream and jumbo baccala. Mr. Licitra and his wife, Sharon, also make sausage (loaded with fennel) and age cheese on-site. Prices for the groceries vary, but are moderate.

But the main draw, at least on a workday, is the sandwich bar, which features a daily special of panini, focaccia and frittata. Mia Famiglia's signature sandwich is the eggplant wedge with lightly fried eggplant that's been marinated in balsamic vinegar and is topped with smoked mozzarella, roasted peppers and arugula ($4.50). The bread is a dream and you can't go wrong if that's all you order, perhaps with one topping, such as the marinated artichoke hearts. Add a cup of the homemade soup of the day ($2.50), and you'll have the perfect lunch.
