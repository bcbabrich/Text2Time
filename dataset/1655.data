Talk about the economy is everywhere, and the same things are being said. We’re in a deep hole. We may not be able to dig ourselves out. We’re underwater. Our assets are overwhelmed by our debts, which keep growing. The question is who or what can get us out of this mess? Some answer Obama. Some (a much smaller group) say Geithner. Some (in desperation) say China. But others say Jesus Christ.

At first glance, Christian doctrine and economic exigencies seem unrelated, but in recent days I have come across two different ways of bringing them together.

One is an updated version of the Protestant linking of thrift and virtue. Given that we are commanded by the Bible to be good stewards of God’s graces (I Peter 4:10), the prudent management of the material goods of His creation is a religious duty; not because we are to attach ourselves to those goods (that would be idolatry), but because we will only be able to turn our minds to the true treasure — God’s love for us — if we are free from the crippling anxieties that overwhelm us when our earthly treasure is threatened.

In books with titles like “Your Money: Frustration or Freedom,” “Free and Clear: God’s Roadmap to Debt-Free Living” and “Building Your Financial Fortress in 52 Days” (on a model given in the book of Nehemiah), Howard Dayton, Kevin Cross (a felicitous name, given his calling) and others introduce us to God-as-money-manager.

The Bible, they tell us, contains 2,350 verses “that have to do with money and possessions.” If we attend to the lessons of these verses and learn how properly to husband the resources God has given us, we will be doing his work, for “God desires a life for us that is free of debt , and the entrapments and common pitfalls related to financial difficulties” (Cross). “The way out of debt,” Dayton teaches, “is not a declaration of bankruptcy, but surrender to the word of God.”

But in another popular Christian discourse, there is no way out of debt, and bankruptcy is the condition we are in from the moment of birth. This is a Calvinist discourse in which the language of money is allegorized. The debt we owe is owed to the God who made us in his image, an image defiled and corrupted by Adam and Eve, whose heirs in sin we all are. We may think that this unhappy inheritance could be overlain and covered by a succession of good deeds, but every deed we perform is infected by the base motives from which we cannot move one inch away. Every piece of currency we offer in payment of debt only increases it. The situation seems hopeless.

But it’s not, we are told, if we embrace bankruptcy rather than try (vainly) to extricate ourselves from it. The acknowledgment of bankruptcy and of the impossibility of working our way free of it is the beginning of wisdom.

In a radio spot posted on a Christian site (Need Him Resources), a woman’s voice observes that “bankruptcy is so common these days.” Isn’t is strange, she asks rhetorically, that “the hope of rescue depends on declaring that you are bankrupt?”

Strange perhaps, but true in a deeper way than we might have imagined; for “the only hope for business is also the only hope you and I have of escaping the awful consequences of letting us run our own lives instead of letting God run them.”

The problem is that “in God’s eyes we are totally bankrupt” and our debt to God “is totally beyond our ability to pay.” But wait, the debt has already been paid by another. “That’s why God had to send his only Son to die, to pay for our sins.” This is the perfect day, she continues, “to come to the Saviour and declare your bankruptcy,” for “your bill has been paid on a rugged cross” and “you can go to bed tonight debt free.”

The same message, of debts forgiven before you ask, is delivered (with less cheer) by George Herbert’s great poem, “Redemption,” a word that means the payment of an obligation. Herbert’s speaker finds himself in a situation many would recognize today: he has been “a tenant long to a rich Lord,” but discovers that what he owes far exceeds his assets, and he wants to renegotiate: “I resolved to be bold,/And make a suit unto him, to afford/A new small-rented lease and cancel th’old.”

But first he has to find him, and he looks in the places where a really important person might be expected to be hanging out — “In great resorts/In cities, theaters, gardens , parks and courts.” Either he’s just left or he hasn’t been seen, but then, unexpectedly and in the most unlikely circumstances, he turns up: “At length I heard a ragged noise and mirth/Of thieves and murderers: there I him espied.”

Before he or his reader can ask “what on earth are you doing here?”, the final line provides an answer with a compact swiftness that is literally breathtaking: “Who straight, ‘Your suit is granted’, said, and died.” (“Straight” here means “immediately and without detour” and describes the movement and pace of the line it introduces.) The rich Lord has made himself low and wiped away the sinner’s ever-growing debt with his blood, a gift that is efficacious as long as the sinner has faith in him and in nothing else.

This economy, in which funds depleted are endlessly replenished, is underwritten by a power so great and beneficent that it turns failures into treasures. Some economists identify that power as the market and ask us to have faith in it. God might be a better candidate.
