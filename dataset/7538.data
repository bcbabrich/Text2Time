HOLLYWOOD, Nov. 30 —Within the next month television producers will invest tens of millions of dollars filming shows that, in all likelihood, will never be broadcast on the networks. Most, in fact, will be shown to audiences totaling perhaps 100 people and then will disappear forever.

The shows are “pilots.” When a TV producer wants to sell a new series to a network or a sponsor, he will invest as much as $500,000 to produce a pilot film — a sort of sample. Most are filmed at this time of year, shortly before the networks make their weighty decisions about next season's new shows.

The producers are well aware that they are probably wasting their money, because of all pilots produced only between 10 and 20 per cent are actually sold.

Merle Miller went through such agony trying to get his series on the air that, as therapy, he wrote a book about his tribulations entitled “Only You, Dick Daring.” Predictably, a growing number of television producers are coming to the conclusion that the whole ritual of making pilots is patently absurd and that there are better odds in Las Vegas.
