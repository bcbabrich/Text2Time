It is billed as the biggest football game of the college season, a prime-time matchup on Sunday between two superb teams, Louisiana State and Oklahoma, for at least a part of a national title. For L.S.U. Coach Nick Saban, the outcome of the championship game in the Sugar Bowl carries a personal stake as well.

If the Tigers win and claim the Bowl Championship Series title, Saban will be paid one dollar more than the highest-paid college coach in the nation, according to an incentive clause in his contract. It means his annual compensation will exceed by that dollar the more than $2.2 million package paid to the coach who will stand across the field from him at the Superdome: Oklahoma's Bob Stoops.

How did coaching college football become so lucrative?

''Is Alex Rodriguez worth $250 million to play baseball?'' said Skip Bertman, L.S.U.'s athletic director and former baseball coach. ''Of course not, and it's not a question of whether a baseball player or a coach is worth that much. The issue is what is the market value.''

At least 23 college football coaches now earn $1 million, including the six coaches in the other three B.C.S. bowl games, which kick off Thursday with the Rose Bowl. That million-dollar benchmark, which was first reached by Florida State's Bobby Bowden in the mid-1990's, sometimes does not even include the abundance of performance incentives for everything from rankings and bowl games to players' academic performances.
