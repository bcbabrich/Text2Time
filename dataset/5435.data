As if in ascent from his river lounge, Raja jutted one of his tusks wet and grand from the water and he huffed the blowzy wet sigh of a defiant champion between rounds. But he stayed resting in the mud, idle as the state pensioner he has been for the last 20 years. This nine-foot-high creature is the official national treasure of Sri Lanka and he obviously knows it. As the time for the annual procession approaches, concern has grown that he might finally have to be replaced by one of two younger understudies who have been swaggering ambitiously for some time.

There is the 45-year-old upstart, Raja the Younger, who always has a near-lead position in the glittering Tooth Relic procession. He is a local favorite because his tusks seem slightly longer, if not more exquisite, than the Elder's, a considerable factor since only one in 20 Sri Lankan elephants have tusks. And there is the gifted alien, Vijayaraja, rock-star young at 11 years and imported from Thailand as the official understudy. But he is rushing now to learn the Sinhalese words for the 24 basic elephant commands. These go far beyond simple forward and reverse to graceful sidesteps, ear flappings and trunk manipulations that bear out the islanders' conviction that their elephants are paragons of intelligence and grace. Relic Doubted by Some

Some doubt, after centuries of plunder and desecration, that the casket really contains the sacred tooth said to have been retrieved from the cremation of Buddha in India. Leonard Woolf, the colonial official and husband of Virginia, claimed to have seen the relic 75 years ago, concluding it was not human, but ''a canine tooth, about three inches and curved.''

This is denied as the relic has long been venerated here at the Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Tooth, a rallying point for Sri Lanka across centuries of subjugation.

The casket is kept closed, and the parade is an annual reaffirmation of national spirit. In this, Raja, who has received elephantine doses of rheumatism medicines, cannot be seen to be flagging in his regal bearing.
