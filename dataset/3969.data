A little-noted amendment to the farm bill approved by the Congress last week is causing an uproar among consumer groups and even some producers of meat and poultry. But the framers of the amendment, Republican staff members of the House Agriculture Committee, say they cannot understand what all the furor is about.

The amendment creates a Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection Panel, with broad powers to review the decisions by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service on such matters as inspection procedures, food safety standards and practices in meat and poultry plants as well as work rules and labor relations.

Backers say the review panel would improve food safety by requiring more scientists to be involved in the decisions. Opponents say the panel's mandate will be too comprehensive. "We would grind to a halt," said Mike Taylor, Acting Under Secretary for Food Safety and Inspection Services. "An incredible array of almost all the decisions we make would be put through this committee."

The creation of the panel comes at a time when the Agriculture Department is about to replace the current system of visual inspections of meat and poultry with a more scientific approach that includes microbial testing and performance standards. While the industry does not agree with all provisions of the new system, called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, most in the industry are eager for it to begin.
