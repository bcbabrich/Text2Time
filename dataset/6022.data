In evaluating “Between the Wars,” a 16‐week series going into syndication this week (Wednesdays at 7:30 on WNEW/Channel 5 in the New York area), dispassionate observers would be hard put to decide which is more “creative”: the programs or the commercials. The “Survey of American Diplomatic History From Versailles to Pearl Harbor” has been produced by Alan Landsburg Productions for Mobil Oil as part of a project called Mobil Showcase. In fact, the series was created by Herb Schmertz, a Mobil vice president. How and why has a major oil company gone into the business of television production?

Ironically, it all began with noncommercial or public television. Mobil was one of the first giant corporations to perceive the potential good will and prestige benefits from “underwriting” programs on public TV, which was providing relatively small but more educated, more affluent and more influential audiences. Mobil has reaped invaluable image puffery from its support of Masterpiece Theater and other public TV projects. But such underwriting is limited and occasionally can be tricky. Mobil had its knuckles rapped publicly for a sports nostalgia series, also created by Mr. Schmertz. The series wasn't all that bad, but the television schedule hardly needed another sports show, especially on public television, and the project represented a further suspicious incursion by a corporation into a system that must remain fiercely independent in order to retain credibility.

In the meantime, while the energy crisis was throwing the oil companies into their own public‐relations crisis, Mobil was battling the three major networks about what it might or might not say in its commercials. One solution to all these nagging problems was to create Mobil Showcase, for which Mobil would supply both the commercials and the programs. The commercials have been crafted with consummate shrewdness. In some, Mobil merely notes its good cultural works, such as supporting Masterpiece Theater, collecting brownie points the way sinners used to collect after‐life “indulgences” from the Church. In others, various persons of note are profiled with open admiration while an unseen announcer makes the facile connection between “the imagination of a genius” and “the imagination of a company.” The concluding kicker: “We respect imagination; we wouldn't be who we are without it.” One such subject is Joan Ganz Cooney, indeed a person worth noting, but somehow her establishing and operating of the Children's Television Workshop is equated with Mobil's acquisition of Montgomery Ward. The leaps of logic are breathtaking. It almost becomes necessary to pinch oneself as a reminder that Mobil is in the powerful and turbulent business of oil.

That leaves the programs. A just‐concluded series called “When Havoc Struck” merely cashed in on the public's partiality toward disasters. Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados and the like provided the basic fodder. “Between the Wars,” however, is considerably more ambitious and demanding. Anthony Potter is the series producer. Eric Sevareid, recently retired from CBS News, is the host and narrator. Using the brief theme of the famous opening clarinet glissando from George Gershwin's “Rhapsody in Blue,” the programs tackle complex issues in an effort to demonstrate that, beginning with the peace talks at Versailles, the course of our lives was preordained. They examine a record of “mistakes made, opportunities lost, triumphs as well as tragedies.” Old photographs are combined with newsreel footage, on‐location shooting with period sound recordings to recreate occasions and events. In the second installment, “The League of Nations: Return to Isolationism,” a modern technique is employed as the League of Nations debate is conveyed with artists' sketches overlaying the actual voices of Henry Cabot Lodge and William Borah.
