If any companies in the personal-computer industry are prone to painful cycles and oversupply problems, it is the makers of disk drives, the unglamorous but critical components that store a computer's data. And nobody knows this better than one of the disk-drive pioneers, Finis Conner.

Yet despite his travails, or perhaps because of them, Mr. Conner is back, and with a new strategy.

Mr. Conner's new company, Conner Technology, based in San Jose, Calif., plans to make drives for the budget end of the market, selling $100 drives for PC's that would be priced around $600. Mining this low-margin end of the market, Mr. Conner is trying some profit shortcuts, including incorporating in Ireland to cut taxes and subcontracting manufacturers in China to trim costs.

Certainly, Mr. Conner is no stranger to risk in the drive business. Twenty years ago, along with Al Shugart, Mr. Conner co-founded what would become Seagate Technology, the disk-drive industry's biggest survivor. In 1986, the partners had a bitter falling out, and Mr. Conner struck out on his own, founding Conner Peripherals. Ten years later, despite phenomenal growth, the company became buried in debt, battered by increasingly heavy competition. Mr. Conner was forced to sell out -- to Seagate.

That was 1996, and shortly afterward Mr. Conner disappeared from the scene, self-exiled by a noncompete agreement with Seagate that kept him out of the drive market for two years. Within a few months after the contract expired last year, Mr. Conner founded Conner Technology. Mr. Shugart, incidentally, lost control of Seagate last year and was forced by its board to sign a noncompete agreement that will keep him on the disk-drive sidelines for three years.
