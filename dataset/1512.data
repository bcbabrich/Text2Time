As the search for causes of the financial crisis continues in Washington, one economist, Russell Roberts of George Mason University, says he believes that it was inept government policy, not Wall Street greed, that allowed the financial system to spin out of control.

Mr. Roberts, who follows the free-market Hayek school of economics, argues in a new paper that almost any attempt to reform the nation’s financial regulatory structure will fail to prevent another crisis, as the government will continue to limit the downside risk to both Main Street and Wall Street, encouraging reckless behavior.

He contends that the government has put in place a system in which it is easy to gamble with other people’s money — particularly borrowed money — by making sure that almost everybody who makes bad loans gets their money back.

“The financial crisis of 2008 was a natural result of these perverse incentives,” Mr. Roberts argues in his paper, “Gambling With Other People’s Money: How Perverted Incentives Caused the Financial Crisis.” He asserts that “we must return to the natural incentives of profit and loss if we want to prevent future crises.”

Mr. Roberts argues that public policy decisions have perverted the incentives that naturally create stability in financial markets and the market for housing by subsidizing losses for bondholders and homeowners, respectively. He believes that over the last 30 years government policy has “coddled creditors,” reducing the risk they face from financing bad investments.

While he says that Wall Street was not blameless in this system, as bankers lobbied for polices that created the problem, it was the government’s track record of riding to the rescue of investors that allowed them to take far greater risks than they normally would have if they thought they could lose nearly everything.

For example, Mr. Roberts argues that the government policy to push for greater home ownership led to a chain of events in which unqualified borrowers were getting mortgages for houses they could never afford.

The banks wrote the mortgages to sell to investors who in turn sold them off to government-backed entities, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Without such entities, lending standards would have been stronger.

The public jumped on the housing bandwagon as investors. For no money down, thanks to changes in government policy, people could buy real estate with little downside risk. If they could not pay their mortgages, they could always walk away from their homes with little loss.

The same can be said for large investors. From the Mexican peso crisis in 1995 to the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998 and the fall of Bear Stearns in 2008, the government stepped up with plans to help large institutional investors from losing money.

While equity holders bear the risk of profit and loss, Mr. Roberts argues that bondholders have little downside risk thanks to government intervention.

This supposed preference for bondholders helped Freddie and Fannie attract billions of dollars from small and large investors, which in turn, financed the housing boom as it allowed these government-sponsored enterprises to buy up all those bad mortgages.

If Fannie’s and Freddie’s bonds reflected their true risk, they would never have been bought up by the Chinese government or small investors, Mr. Roberts contends, adding that the government just made things worse when it moved in to secure the two mortgage giants in the fall of 2008.

By not letting the bondholders bear some loss, Mr. Roberts argues, the government just made the system riskier.

The one case in which the government did not come to the rescue involved Lehman Brothers. While some people believe that the failure of such an interconnected investment bank was a main reason that the financial crisis accelerated, Mr. Roberts sees it differently.

It was the shock of a possible change in government policy to bail out troubled bondholders, not the collapse of Lehman, that sent the markets into a tailspin.

When the market thought the government would not bail out other companies from that point onward, investors began pulling their money out of the system, Mr. Roberts noted.

It was not until the government signaled that it would not let any other major financial firm fail that the markets started to normalize.

So-called moral hazard is therefore deeply rooted in the investing world. As such, Mr. Roberts contends that Wall Street is nothing more than a giant government-sanctioned Ponzi scheme.

“Rescues have distorted the natural feedback loops of capitalism,” Mr. Roberts wrote. “Rescuing rich people from the consequences of their decisions with money coming from average Americans is bad for democracy.”

In the end, Mr. Roberts argues that financial regulatory overhaul will fail to prevent future crises, with investors — homeowners, bondholders or Wall Street bankers — continuing to count on the government to bail them out if anything goes wrong.

While some believe more regulation is needed, Mr. Roberts argues that it was government intervention in the markets that created the crisis and that less, not more, regulation is what the system needs to heal and to survive.
