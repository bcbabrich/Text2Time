But the bridesmaids' dresses, which Mrs. O'Neill hoped to make herself, have gone unsewn. She, like so many others, has become a full-time mourner, a person who, unable to make things better, must concentrate on not making things worse. Each day she drives -- to Port Washington, to Manhattan, to Lattingtown, to Islip, to Darien, Conn. -- checking the digital compass above her rearview mirror. And each day she sits in sanctuaries where no matter which way she turns her head, she sees someone she knows who has lost someone else. Having nothing more substantial, she carries tissues. ''For the first time, I understand why a little thing like a handkerchief can be so important,'' she said.

Her first service was on Wednesday, Sept. 19, for Tom Collins, a bond salesman she had known for years. She has been to a service for her husband's 57-year-old partner, Herman S. Sandler, a Mass for her 22-year-old nephew, Peter O'Neill, and a service for John McDowell, 33, an equity salesman. She has attended services for people she has known for decades, and those for people she socialized with once or twice a year. She went to two on Saturday, one yesterday, and will attend at least one today. Memorial services are scheduled well into October.

But there is no abacus for this type of accounting. ''I'm not even adding it up, and you know why?'' Mrs. O'Neill asked, steering toward the Throgs Neck Expressway. ''I want every one of them to be the first. I don't want to be like, this is my 10th, this is my 12th.''

''The first time, I said, 'How can I feel this intensely 67 more times? Am I going to get worn out, and by the 65th one, will I just be drained of tears, immune to the horror of it?' However, I find that each one I go to, it gets worse. It doesn't get better, it gets worse. I would rather have it get worse each time than have gotten better.''

By trial, she has learned her limitations: three services in one day are too many. Two are manageable. Sometimes, she and her husband or daughters can go together. Other times, they must split up. At night, she distracts herself with her knitting, watching ''Friends'' or ''Will and Grace.'' She bakes an apple cake. She lulls herself to sleep with thoughts of her garden, where now the black-eyed Susans have lost their yellow petals and offer only black, budlike cores to the thinning autumn sun.
