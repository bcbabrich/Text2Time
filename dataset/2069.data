Click “read more” and then refresh like crazy to follow the play-by-play commentary of the Group B match between Mexico and Ecuador, LIVE, as it happens at the Estadio Monumental de Maturín in Maturín, Venezuela. Duncan Irving brings you the action.

Final thoughts: El Tri tops Group B and qualifies for the quarterfinals. Mexico deserved this against a labored Ecuador team that needed a fluke goal to make the scoreline respectable. Ecuador needs a win against Brazil on Wednesday night, and a Mexican victory against Chile to retain any hope of advancing. (Here’s a hint: They’re going home.) That’s it from me. Join me tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. eastern for an action-packed minute-by-minute involving the United States and Paraguay.

90+2 Fulltime Mexico 2-1 Ecuador. That’ll do it.

90 There will be two minutes of stoppage time.

85 GOOOOOAAAALLL Mexico 2-1 Ecuador Just when they looked dead, Mendez sends in a long-range daisycutter that takes a deflection off Magallon and wrongfoots Sanchez. The Ecuador players can’t bring themselves to celebrate.

83 Substitution Mexico: Morales off; Pineda on.

79 GOOOOOAALLLL Mexico 2-0 Ecuador. Goodbye Ecuador. Blanco floats an inch-perfect cross into the Ecuadoran box that sub Omar Bravo heads home.

78 Subsitution Ecuador: Carlos Tenoria off; Borja on.

77 Substitution Mexico: Blanco on; Castillo off. Enter the grumpy old man.

76 Benitez hits a hard shot from 20 yards that Sanchez does well to palm wide. Ecuador recovers the ball but nobody is on hand to meet the cross.

71 Substitution Ecuador: Ayovi on; Bagui off.

69 No good work goes unpunished — Castillo gets no joy from the referee after some rough treatment by the Ecuadoran defense.

67 More good work by Nery Castillo, who dances into the box and floats a shot that ends up on top of the goal. It was a little over-elaborate by Castillo, but he really is one of the few bright spots out there for either team.

64 Substitution Mexico: Omar Bravo on; Cacho off.

59 Dangerous work by Mexico’s Arce, who slips into the six yard box, and with Mora stranded, opts to hit a cross-cum-shot that Espinoza clears off the line.

58 Another good turn and shoot from Benitez. This time Sanchez palms it wide.

57 Benitez fires tamely at Sanchez after good work by Bagui.

56 Ouch! Poor old Castro goes up for a header and finds himself floored and flattened by Espinoza. The referee awards a drop ball.

55 … that Mendez drills wide. Ecuador is much improved this half. Or are the Mexicans just being generous? Discuss.

54 De la Cruz hits the deck here, falling over himself outside the area. The ref says Pinto did it. So a free kick to Ecuador …

52 Carlos is the surviving Tenorio. I know this because he’s just hit a nice shot at Sanchez. The ball goes behind for a corner. Benitez gave a good feed.

46 Substitution Ecuador. The eyes do lie. Reasco is on for a Tenorio to be named later.

47 Free kick to Ecuador. This one heads to the far post from the right. The ball is scrambled behind for a corner.

46 We’re off again. Eyes, fingers and thumbs tell me that both lineups are unchanged.

45+1 Halftime: Mexico-Ecuador 1-0.Well, Mexico scored once, and should have had a couple more to put this one away. They probably will add a couple in the second half, unless Ecuador can sort out their left back and their central defenders. Castillo is continuing his fine run of form in attack.

45 There will be one minute of stoppage time.

42 Hoo-boy, another escape for Ecuador. A monumental screwup by the Ecuadoran defense — Hurtado sends a weak header back to the keeper — lets Castillo in. He races onto the ball on the left, and pulls Mora out of the area on the left, but Mora stays with him, one-on-one, until De La Cruz races in to hoof the ball into the stands.

40 Two big chances for Mexico, both from Arce. First, he fires a shot at Mora, who thoughtfully bats it back to him. Then, a second shot that Espinoza chests away on the goalline. Told you he was a man-mountain.

38 The ball is in the net after the free kick, which produced a tangle of bodies before an Ecuadoran emerged to stab the ball in, but the flag’s up for offside. Mexico’s defense looked very shaky there.

37 This is better from Ecuador. There’s more zip and aggression in their approach play. Benitez draws a free kick on the right of the area from Magallon.

33 Good chance for Ecuador. Bagui roasts Castro on the left and hits a low cross to Benitez, whose shot fizzes past the post. Replays show that Magallon had done a good job of closing down the angle of the shot.

30 Close call there for Ecuador. Castillo intercepts a loose ball and charges into the Ecuadoran half. He plays the ball to Arce, who hits a dipping drive over the bar, when he should have passed to Cacho.

29 Good spell of possession by Ecuador, but they won’t be able to maintain this pace.

26 The fans are into it now, as cries of “Mexico” ring around the stadium.

24 That goal arrived just after the first round of the Wave, a sure sign of a boring game. Let’s hope for improvement now, although an Ecuadoran opener would have made for a better game for the neutrals.

23 Yellow card Ecuador: Ivan Hurtado vents his frustrations on Castillo.

22 GOOOOOOALLLLL!!! Mexico 1-0 Ecuador. Nery Castillo takes a fine through ball from Marquez. Castillo darts between Hurtado and Bagui, rounds Mora and slides the ball into an empty net. Cacho should also take some credit, for a dummy run that confounded the defense and allowed Castillo to slip in.

21 Castillo flattens Marquez in the Mexican area. Free kick Mexico.

19 Great run from Carlos Tenoria, who tears into the area from the left. Sanchez takes his no prisoners with a timely dive.

17 Good work from Castillo, as a nice run ends with a cross to Cacho that would have been pinpoint were Cacho seven-foot-five.

14 Mexico begin to probe the Ecuadoran half — hurrah. The passes can’t breach either the offside trap or the man-mountain at center half, Espinoza.

12 Embarrassed. He’s up.

11 That said, Benitez has just made a nice run down the left and has hit a good cross. Fortunately for Mexico, there were no strikers in sight, as Sanchez was flapping around cluelessly in the Mexican goal. He’s now down, either hurt or embarrassed.

10 Okay, this is pretty dull stuff. Ecuador is huffing and puffing around their own half, where they look brilliant. The Mexicans are looking on in admiration in their own half.

7 Ecuador work the ball into the Mexican half, but hit a wall of green shirts. Edwin Tenorio takes a shot from 30 yards, which trundles wide of the far post.

3 Ecuador has a very high defensive line, and Castillo takes a long pass from the back, but is offside.

1 And we’re off. Mexico are playing from right to left. Ecuador start with a counter that leaves Magallon limping after a tussle with De La Cruz.

In the Mexican goal, Oswaldo Sanchez replaces Guillermo Ochoa, who was absolutely terrific against Brazil. There are no changes to the Ecuadoran lineup.

Here’s a look at the starting lineups:

México: Sanchez, Castro, Magallon, Marquez, Pinto, Arce, Correa, Torrado, Morales, Cacho, Castillo.

Ecuador: Cristian Mora, De la Cruz, Iván Hurtado, G. Espinoza, Oscar Bagui, Segundo Castillo, Edwin Tenorio, Antonio Valencia, Edison Méndez, Cristian Benítez, Carlos Tenorio.

Preamble: Hello everyone and welcome to the second head of our double-header. Brazil has just beaten Chile, 3-0, while Mexico is looking to consolidate its position by defeating Ecuador. The 2-0 win over Brazil on Wednesday gave El Tri some much-needed wiggle room, but Hugo Sanchez’s team will be looking to seal qualification this evening.

For Ecuador, though, this is a must win. Luis Suarez’s team really blew it last Wednesday when they squandered a pretty comfortable lead to allow Umberto Suarez and Chile to snatch a 3-2 win. In all honesty, they only have themselves to blame.
