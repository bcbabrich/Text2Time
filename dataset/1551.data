Fox News moves up, The Associated Press moves over and National Public Radio comes in second.

Mark your seating charts. The new assignments for the White House briefing room are in.

The A.P. correspondent will get the highly coveted front-row center seat previously occupied by Helen Thomas, the White House Correspondents Association announced Sunday.

The reporter for Fox will take The A.P.’s former front-row seat, moving up from the second row, and National Public Radio, now in the third-row, will replace Fox. (That’s got to be tough.)

The new assignments are effective immediately.

N.P.R., Fox and Bloomberg News — also seated in the second row — have lobbied for Ms. Thomas’s seat ever since the former United Press International and Hearst News Service writer resigned in June amid controversy over videotaped remarks she made calling on Israelis to get “out of Palestine.”

“It was a very difficult decision, the association said in a statement Sunday. “The board received requests from Bloomberg and N.P.R. in addition to Fox for relocation to the front row and felt all three made compelling cases. But the board ultimately was persuaded by Fox’s length of service and commitment to the White House television pool.”

The decision is not likely to go over well with many liberals who criticize Fox for right-wing tendencies. The progressive group, MoveOn.org, even launched an online campaign to encourage the association to give the seat to N.P.R.
