The American public has eaten up the stories of wrongly convicted people freed by DNA evidence -- in print, on television and even in a recent, well-received play. What the public is less aware of is how hard the government often makes it for convicted people to get DNA testing. In a new twist, prosecutors are increasingly fighting to keep prisoners behind bars even when DNA testing points to innocence. This backlash should be resisted.

At least 132 Americans have been exonerated by DNA testing, but for many of them, getting it was a struggle. About 30 states have laws giving convicted people access to DNA testing, but that access varies considerably. Some states pay for testing whenever there is a reasonable claim of innocence. Others will test only when prosecutors favor it, or give people only a short window of time to show that testing could exonerate them. In Florida, the deadline for old cases is Oct. 1.

As a result of these obstacles, many convicted people who ought to have access to DNA testing can't get it. Even in states where they have a right to the tests, making the case that there is relevant material to be tested, and that a negative result would point to innocence, can take years. In several states, DNA access laws have already expired, after being in force for just a year or two.

Some prosecutors are now arguing that even when a DNA test excludes the evidence being tested, it may not be proof of innocence. In the case of Wilton Dedge of Florida, as Adam Liptak reported last week in The Times, recent DNA testing showed that two hairs, the only physical evidence against him, did not belong to him. But prosecutors insist that the case against him is still strong and are resisting a new trial. In fact, the main pieces of evidence remaining -- a deeply flawed eyewitness identification, a highly dubious ''scent line-up'' by a dog and the word of a jailhouse snitch -- suggest considerable doubt about his guilt.
