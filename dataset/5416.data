Developers frequently complain that the restrictions imposed by preservation agencies on rehabilitations of properties in historic districts are expensive and meddlesome.

In the last few years, however, the value of an authentic historic look has taken on such strong market appeal that developers have been known to add ''historic'' touches to new buildings. The current rush to mirror the architectural features of prewar Manhattan apartment houses is an example.

Now, it seems, history has become such a big seller that it may pay developers to duplicate the objectives of a landmarks commission.

Such was the thinking of Michel Rosenberg when he purchased a row of four vacant and dilapidated 1910 tenement buildings on Garfield Place in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. He bought them for $2.4 million in 1984 with the intention of turning them into 40 moderately priced condominiums. They were neither in a historic district nor individually listed, but they nevertheless had a distinctive character that a sensitive rehabilitation could enhance.
