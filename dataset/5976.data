Families that last year rented their apartments within hours of listing them with an agency are nervously waiting weeks for takers, to subsidize the summer way of life to which they have committed themselves. Classified advertisements that in previous years produced 30 or more interested callers now lead to one or two inquiries. Those who imagined vast profits from sublet rentals that would be above what they pay have knocked their prices down two or three times until they are comparable to rents being asked on unfurnished apartments.

''It is definitely a buyer's market this year,'' said Nancy Packes, president of the Feathered Nest, a sublet agency. ''The law of supply and demand prevails in the sublet marketplace and people are renting for their own rental, if at all. The profit motive has been skewed.''

One woman now asking $3,000 for a two-month sublet of her apartment in a high-rise building on East 75th Street said she received three offers in one day last year ''at a good profit.'' This year she was unable to find a renter after listing her apartment with four real estate agents and running three newspaper advertisements. So she has lowered her price almost to her monthly rent. ''Even without renting it I can still go on my trip to France,'' she said, adding ruefully, ''You are in a tremendous advantage if you can sublet.''

Several real estate agents estimated that there were 2,000 higherpriced sublets (at $600 a month and above) on the market this summer, including sublets listed with agents, in newspapers and on bulletin boards in offices, schools, bookstores and coffee houses throughout the city. More than 300 classified advertisements for furnished apartments and sublets appeared in each of two newspapers on a recent Sunday - almost as many listings as for regular unfurnished units.

On the members-only bulletin board at Actors Equity there were 60 sublet notices posted; last winter there were 15. At Columbia University's student housing office there are 300 index cards with summer sublets available, and only a handful of apartments available for the fall. ''It's a buyer's market for the summer and a seller's market the rest of the year,'' said the office manager, Cherry Sontag.
