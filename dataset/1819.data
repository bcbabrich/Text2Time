Since the advent of the modern primary system in the 1970s, New York Republicans have largely avoided the fractious intraparty battles that have divided their Democratic Party counterparts in election years like 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1992. But the party did so in part by heavily favoring establishment candidates and making it hard for challengers to get on the ballot. In 1996 and 2000, the New York Republican leadership’s efforts to block party insurgents made its arcane rules the focus of national attention — and embarrassment.

This year, the state’s entire Republican establishment — including the state party’s chairman, Joseph N. Mondello; its elected official, State Senator Joseph L. Bruno; and its best-known political figure, Rudolph W. Giuliani — have all lined up behind Senator John McCain of Arizona. But remarkably, it was Mr. McCain who in 2000 waged a highly publicized legal battle against the New York Republican party that ultimately prompted an overhaul of ballot access rules and the creation of a winner-take-all delegate-allocation system like California’s.

Under the old ballot-access requirements, which were considered to be the most daunting in the nation, presidential candidates were required to collect 1,250 signatures or 5 percent of the registered Republicans in each of the state’s Congressional districts, whichever number was smaller. (New York had 31 Congressional districts in 1996 and 2000, but now has only 29.) A minimum of 5,000 signatures had to be gathered statewide. In a time-honored ritual, front-runners would challenge their rivals over technicalities like misspelled names. To be safe, election lawyers urged candidates to get at least twice the number of required signatures in order to withstand legal challenges.

In January 1996, lawyers for Bob Dole, the front-runner in the Republican race to challenge President Bill Clinton, went to court in Brooklyn, alleging that Steve Forbes, the senator’s most serious challenger in the state, had engaged in widespread fraud in his attempt to be placed on the March primary ballot. The Dole campaign challenged the petitions submitted in each of the 11 Congressional districts in New York City.

Mr. Forbes and another candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan, had fought to get on the ballot in many parts of the state, and Mr. Forbes, whose net worth is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, was not going to give up easily. He went to court, and in February 1996 won a unanimous appellate ruling ordering that his name be placed on the ballot in all 31 Congressional districts.

Even with his name on the ballot, Mr. Forbes faced daunting challenges. Under the party rules at the time, primary voters did not vote directly for the candidates, but rather for delegates pledged to certain candidates. Mr. Dole had the support of the state’s Republican establishment — including Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki — and his delegate candidates were well-known local figures. Mr. Forbes’s delegates were people most voters had never heard of.

In the end, such advantages worked to the benefit of Mr. Dole, who won the March 7, 1996 primary overwhelmingly, capturing 92 of the 93 delegates at stake. Mr. Forbes won only one delegate, despite having spent more than $2 million on the primary, and Mr. Buchanan won no delegates.

Following the problems in 1996, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, pushed through changes that reduced some technical requirements and lowered the number of signatures necessary to qualify for the Republican presidential primary ballot in each district. But the changes did not far enough to avoid a similar and even more high-profile problem over ballot access in 2000.

Going into the 2000 primary, the Republican establishment quickly rallied around a front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. As a result, three underdog candidates — Gary L. Bauer, Senator Orrin G. Hatch and Alan Keyes — announced plans to skip New York’s primary. Senator McCain’s campaign faced the daunting prospect of trying to get on the ballot in all 31 Congressional districts.

“There is no reason why New York law should be so difficult,” Guy V. Molinari, who was the Staten Island borough president and heading the McCain campaign in the state, said at the time.

In December 1999, Mr. McCain announced that he would file a federal lawsuit to allow all widely recognized candidates onto the primary ballot. He called on Mr. Bush, Governor Pataki and the state party to abandon the onerous rules, arguing that no other state made it so difficult for presidential candidates to enter primaries.

By the following month, January 2000, even before the lawsuit had been heard, the McCain campaign had managed to secure spots on the ballot in 25 of the 31 Congressional districts. The Bush campaign signaled that it planned to start challenging Mr. McCain’s nominating petitions. Mr. McCain called on Mr. Bush to stop the effort, comparing it to Communist repression.

Then the Republican State Committee announced that it would seek to disqualify Mr. McCain from the primary ballot in roughly half the state.

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had already endorsed Mr. Bush, came to Mr. McCain’s defense. “The primaries should be open, whether you like the people who are going to be in it or not,” he told reporters at City Hall.

As the issue threatened to become a national embarrassment for the Republicans, the Democrats saw a political opportunity and weighed in, aiding Mr. McCain’s efforts to get on the ballot.

The federal judge hearing Mr. McCain’s lawsuit declared at a hearing, “Everything tells us that the reason for all the rules is to advantage the chosen candidate of the Republican Party.” Then the judge forced the party on Long Island to drop its attempt to toss Mr. Forbes from the ballot.

Worried that their hard-charging tactics had backfired, the Republican leaders signaled that they would abandon their legal battle with Mr. McCain. Then an embarrassing situation nearly turned into a farce: party officials admitted that petitions for Mr. Bush had been fraudulently assembled in a Congressional district in the South Bronx, and a state judge removed Mr. Bush from the primary ballot in the district.

Governor Pataki, alarmed about the political costs the battle had exacted, finally gave in, announcing that the party would ensure that Mr. McCain was on the ballot statewide. Days later, the federal judge hearing Mr. McCain’s lawsuit ruled that two of the party’s requirements for circulating nominating petitions were unconstitutional and ordered Mr. McCain and Mr. Keyes placed on the ballot.

By late February, with Republicans facing the first contested statewide primary in New York in 20 years, Mr. Bush held a slim but steady lead over Mr. McCain. In the March 7 primary, Mr. Bush’s victory was even more decisive. He captured 67 of the 93 delegates, with 26 delegates for Mr. McCain and none for Mr. Keyes.

After the primary, Mr. Pataki, who had a great deal invested in Mr. Bush’s victory, urged a revision of the presidential primary rules to make the ballot simpler and to make it far easier for candidates to enter contests.

Mr. Pataki’s proposal also made New York’s primary a winner-take-all contest like California’s, an idea that the State Senate majority leader, Mr. Bruno, opposed. Mr. Bruno eventually gave in, and the State Senate passed the proposal in April 2000 — although, as Richard Pérez-Peña noted at the time, many ballot obstacles remain for office-seekers in New York.
