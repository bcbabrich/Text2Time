If we forget about the controversy surrounding each of these programs over the past 30 days — Brian Kelly leaving for Notre Dame, Urban Meyer’s health scare and ongoing coaching future — this game is as exciting as any bowl this season. On one hand, you have the Big East champion Bearcats, who sport one of the most prolific, exciting offenses in the country. Cincinnati’s rapid ascension from F.B.S. afterthought to Big East power has been one of the best stories of this decade. Florida is running low after a loss to Alabama in the SEC championship, which prevented the Gators from playing for yet another national championship, but the Gators are clearly one of the best teams in the country. Of course, this is the final collegiate game for quarterback Tim Tebow, who we will all miss — whether you want to admit it or not. It may be difficult for both teams to forget about the off-field news, but if we’re lucky, once this game gets underway we will see two of the top teams in the nation.

Cincinnati

Lost in the recent developments in both Gainesville and Lubbock has been the emotion flowing from the Cincinnati program following Brian Kelly’s departure for Notre Dame. If you have forgotten — and no one would blame you — there was a massive sense of anger and resentment from the Cincinnati players after Kelly broke the news; these Bearcats may play their best game of the season merely to spite their former coach, if not to complete a perfect season. Stepping in for Kelly in this game is Kerry Coombs, a former Ohio high school coach and the current U.C. defensive backs coach and assistant head coach. The offensive coordinator Jeff Quinn will continue to call plays while creating the team’s game plan before leaving to take the coaching job at Buffalo. Thanks for hanging around, coach. He will have countless weapons to work with, many of whom have burst upon the national scene thanks to Cincinnati’s undefeated regular season. One is quarterback Tony Pike, who threw for 2,350 yards and 26 touchdowns despite missing at least a portion of four games. His favorite target is the fantastic receiver Mardy Gilyard (80 receptions for 1,150 yards), who also makes an impact on special teams. One area of concern for the Bearcats is on defense, which despite being ranked in the top 50 in most statistical categories has struggled in recent weeks. Giving up 44 points to Pittsburgh is cause for concern.

Florida

One fear for Florida is a letdown. Last season’s Sugar Bowl saw Utah beat an Alabama team that, like Florida, was coming off a loss in the SEC title game that cost the Tide a shot at the national championship. One difference, of course, is that Cincinnati enters this game with a slightly better resume than did Utah, meaning Florida may be less likely to come out flat. One reason why the Gators won’t? Tim Tebow, obviously. Tebow’s wonderful college career — like him or hate him — wraps up here, and the former Heisman Trophy winner will certainly have the Gators ready to play. One reason why the Gators will come out flat? The hysteria surrounding Urban Meyer’s retirement and comeback. While Meyer will be coaching the game tonight, the focus his surreal waffling placed upon the program can only serve as a distraction. Having said that, because of the combination of this being the final game for both Tebow and countless other Gators and the potential motivation of Meyer’s impending departure, it would not surprise me in the least to see the best effort Florida has put forth all season.

Know Your Sponsor

Allstate

We’re all in good hands with Allstate, which has sponsored the Sugar Bowl since 2007. Unfortunately, Allstate has yet to see a competitive Sugar Bowl: 2007 saw L.S.U. beat Notre Dame by 41-14, 2008 featured Georgia’s 41-10 destruction of Hawaii and last season, as mentioned, saw Utah upset Alabama. More bad news: the American Association of Justice ranks Allstate as the nation’s worst insurer. The most damaging quote from the A.A.J.’s press release? “One Allstate employee reported that supervisors told agents to lie and blame fires on arson, and in turn, were rewarded with portable fridges.”

Pick ‘Em

Pete: Florida. Tim Tebow leaves with a decisive final victory, as Cincinnati hasn’t stopped anyone lately.

Thayer: Florida. This game won’t cause Urban Meyer any chest pains.

Paul: Florida. This game really would have been something without the off-field news of the past month.

Fred: Florida. Lots going on in this one other than football, but I think the Gators are just more talented than Cincinnati. I also don’t see Tim Tebow losing his final collegiate game.

Connor: Florida. The Bearcats have given up a lot of points all season and this time they won’t be able to make up the difference on offense.
