At or about 3:30 P.M. on April 14, 1977, Eleanor Schrabal was apprehended by a sharp‐eyed Suffolk County policeman at the Hills shopping plaza in Center Moriches. L.I.

The charge: Driving a moped.

The amazed 46‐year‐old housewife received five summonses, two alleging misdemeanors, making her one of the more extreme—and probably one of the last—victims of the bizarre dispute surrounding New York State's sixmonth ‐ old revised motorized ‐ bicyle law.

Yesterday, after six months of confusion over interpretations of the law, Justice Robert C. Williams of State Supreme Court gave a long‐slaked green light to unlicensed operation of all mopeds that do not exceed 17 miles an hour.

The decision promises to spur locally the fast ‐ spreading national moped craze imported from Europe and to clear the court dockets of cases involving owners like Mrs. Schrabal.
