At the counter, Ms. Maldonado explains to a clerk the purpose of her visit. She wants furniture for the new publicly subsidized apartment that she has just moved into. She had received a $706 grant only two months earlier, which paid for beds for her two children and herself as well as a five-drawer dresser, a kitchen table and four chairs. But she still needed something to sit on in the living room and a dresser for her own room

It is unlikely that the city will help her, she knows, but she has no other way to pay. Although she has received training in Web design and emergency services, and is now getting training as a nurse's aide, Ms. Maldonado has not worked since 2001, when she was a receptionist. The father of her two children is in prison and contributes nothing to the family budget, but she does receive some financial help from her boyfriend, she said.

The clerks give her a lavender slip and send her to the matching waiting room. Ms. Maldonado does not know it, but this room was also a recent innovation, designed for people with relatively simple requests, like a public assistance card to replace one that had been lost or a child-care referral. In theory, by separating people with more complex needs, like applying for public assistance or child care, both lines will move more swiftly.

Still, Ms. Maldonado is unappeased. Having been at the center in December, she knows that all she has to do is fill out a form. With a pretty face and a dazzling smile, she has had luck in the past using personal charm to shortcut the system. She tries here, but to little avail. ''Can't you just give me the form now?'' she pleads with the clerks. But they insist that she has to get in the purple line.

Once in the appropriately tinted section, she takes a quick read of the situation and decides she is in for the long haul. The number printed on her slip is F3127, but on the electronic board that keeps track of clients being served, there is only one F ticket being served -- F3078, at Window 4. Other letters like G and D are at other windows and nobody is going anywhere quickly. After F3078 does not change for 10 minutes, Ms. Maldonado walks out at 12:50. She visits her lawyer (she is suing a previous landlord) and the subsidized housing office before heading back.

2:25 p.m. Ticket F3078 is still being served at Window 4, according to the electronic board.

By now the purple room is standing room only, upwards of 50 people at least -- which is not bad compared to the gold floor, where welfare cases are opened and more than 100 people waited on a recent afternoon. Still, Ms. Maldonado is impatient.

Not one to wait passively for the bureaucracy to do its work, she marches around the corner to Window 4 to find the client responsible for the holdup. But there is no client, only a worker typing into her computer and talking with other clerks. Ms. Maldonado goes to the counter and explains the reason for her pique. The clerk offers no explanation but promises the angry client that her number will be seen soon.
