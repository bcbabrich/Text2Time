''America and Europe will continue to need each other into the 21st century,'' Mr. Schmidt said, ''but it remains to be seen whether the euro is good for the United States. Some governments will shift dollar-denominated assets into euro-denominated ones, which means the U.S. Treasury might have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors.''

Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, though, wishes the euro were not quite so strong at the start. ''The dollar at the moment is a little too weak,'' he said. ''I have the feeling the American economy is slowing down a bit, and that the American authorities accept that. There will be a dynamic between the euro's spontaneous tendency to strengthen, and a monetary policy for the euro that will try to contain that tendency.''

The difference in views reflects longstanding divergence in German and French attitudes toward money. For Germany, a strong mark was a symbol a defeated nation could take pride in after the war, a fact Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he had felt obliged to take into account when he and Mr. Schmidt devised their 1978 plan.

''For the Germans, the idea of abandoning the Deutsche mark, losing it, and entrusting it to a bank controlled by governments they did not feel as much confidence in as in their own independent central bank, was impossible,'' Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said. ''So independence for the European central bank was an essential core idea.

''The ease with which the Germans have accepted the end of the mark surprised me, and I think it surprised them, too. The strict criteria, the requirement to cut budget deficits, the independence of the central bank in the plan, all had the merit of reassuring the Germans.''

The idea of a strong central bank found its way into the treaty that spelled out the final plan for the euro more than a decade later, though not quite the way Sir Edward would have preferred. Britain, alas, will not use the euro, at least at the start.

''Under our original plan, the City of London would have been the center of the whole deal,'' he said. Instead, he added, ''it all went to Frankfurt,'' where the new European Central Bank is located.
