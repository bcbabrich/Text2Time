Philip (Slim) Connelly was Los Angeles editor of a West Coast Communist newspaper, The People's World, when he was arrested and jailed in July 1951 in a roundup of Communist Party leaders in California. After a six-month trial, in 1952 he and 13 other men and women were found guilty of having violated the Smith Act of 1940, which made it a crime to conspire to teach or advocate the overthrow of the Government by force.

It was only the second major test for the legislation as applied to Communists, the first having resulted in the conviction of 11 Communist Party officials in 1949 after a nine-month trial in New York.

In the Los Angeles case, the defendants asserted that they had merely advocated transition to Communism by peaceful means as far as the United States was concerned. Nevertheless, a jury found them guilty, and they were each sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

In 1955, an attorney for the defendants appealed to the United States Supreme Court, filing a petition that contended the convictions were a violation of constitutional guarantees offreedom of the press. The Court overturned the sentences, but Mr. Connelly continued to be denounced by members of Congress. Charges in Congressional Report
