The crew had more than 20 lifeguards at its height. It was made up of young men from the Bronx and Harlem. They met while swimming for the Porpoise Club swim team, which was run by the Parks Department out of St. Mary's Recreation Center in the South Bronx.

The founder of the crew was the coach of the club, a former Coast Guard officer named Charles Smith. Mr. Smith, universally known as Pops or Smitty, was the chief lifeguard at Riis Park from 1952 to 1964. Every summer, he took his swimmers out to work at the beach. ''It was the turning point in all our lives,'' said Mr. Ninons, 61 and a retired accountant. ''He was like a father to us. Some of us had fathers, but some of us didn't. He made us into men.''

Mr. Smith died of cancer last year, but he lives on in the stories his lifeguards tell today.

He was something of a discipline freak, said Mr. Gales, and used to make his men arrange the trash cans on the beach until they formed a perfect a line. His training workouts were apparently brutal. On rainy days when the beach was empty, he had his lifeguards run a half mile down the beach then swim back to the starting point. Run, swim. Run, swim.

''I hated rainy days,'' said Mr. Gales, 62.

Back then, the beaches (known as bays) were fairly segregated, not by law but by choice. Bays 3, 4 and 5 were predominantly black and were run by Smitty's Crew. It always seemed that some fraternity brothers from Howard University had come up on vacation. The basketball court behind Bay 5 was known for its rough-and-tumble pick-up game.

The whites -- mainly Irish and Italians -- occupied the beaches from Bay 6 south. Bay 1 was the gay beach. The serious beer drinkers went to Bay 13. Still, there was frequent mixing and hardly any problems for the lifeguards with their orange uniforms and orange buoys. ''It was never a color thing,'' said Mr. Ninons. ''We didn't see black or white. Orange was the only color we knew.''
