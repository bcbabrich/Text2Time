Faced with additional signs of a weakening economy, the stock market retreated yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point in an effort to revive growth.

Blue-chip stocks managed to hold on to modest gains after trading higher earlier in the day, but technology stocks dropped. Financial stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, also fell, in a sign that the Fed's half-point cut was already reflected in their prices.

''Today's number was totally baked in, so the market's snoozing after that,'' said John F. Powers, director for institutional sales at Robertson Stephens. ''I think the Fed would be perfectly happy with a market that trended sideways to modestly up.''

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.16 points, to 10,887.36. But the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 7.72 points, to 1,366.01.
