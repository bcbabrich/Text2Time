The three-year study, by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, was greeted with relief by the beef and meat industries. But some scientists questioned its results, particularly because it was based on risk models, and not extensive testing.

Dr. John Collinge, a neurologist at University College in London who is a British expert on the disease, said the United States was making a big mistake by refusing to test cattle herds. ''Every country in Europe went through a phase of denying they had a problem,'' Dr. Collinge said. ''After mandatory testing was introduced last year, countries that denied it vehemently discovered that they did have the disease.''

The United States has tested 12,000 head of cattle out of a population of 100 million. Europe has tested five million. Ms. Veneman said that she would increase testing American herds and that next year 12,500 head would be tested.

B.S.E., a brain-wasting disease, was found in British cattle in the

1980's and has spread throughout Europe and, most recently, to Japan, which today announced its third case. The human analogue, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has been tied to the deaths of more than 100 Europeans, mostly in Britain.

Mad cow disease has never been detected in cattle in North America.

The Harvard researchers based their 550-page report on reviews of American and European programs, data on the course of the disease through Europe and surveys of meat processing in the United States. The study credited early import bans on animals, meat and certain animal feed for preventing the disease from crossing the Atlantic.
