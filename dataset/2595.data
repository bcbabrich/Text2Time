The talks between the companies were ordered last week by Michael K. Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as the agency and the industry face impending legal deadlines. As the Bush administration considers whose side to take in the lobbying war over the leasing rates, top executives from both sides decided to participate in the discussions in order not to offend government officials and regulators.

Participants in the discussions included Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon's chairman and chief executive, Michael D. Capellas, MCI's president and chief executive, and David W. Dorman, the chairman and chief executive of AT&T.

But participants in the discussions said that the talks have left both sides far apart, with the exception of Qwest and MCI. Still, the deal was the most significant one in the area since an appeals court earlier this year threw out the old rate rules.

The talks were the latest round in what has been years of litigation and lobbying over the relationship between the regional Bell companies and their rivals. The issue involved in the discussions amounts to billions of dollars in payments made by the long distance providers and small telephone companies to the regional Bell companies. Those small rivals say that their industry, which was created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and its requirement for low-cost leasing, could be largely obliterated by any significant increases in lease rates.

The Bell companies have replied that they are not getting a large enough financial return on their leased equipment to justify making significant new capital expenditures. They also maintain that the marketplace has become sufficiently competitive and that the rate structure is no longer justified.
