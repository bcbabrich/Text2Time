Seeking to address complaints that his $11 billion, five-year school construction plan did not do enough to reduce severe overcrowding in Queens, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has proposed the addition of 10,650 seats for the borough over the number he called for in his November plan.

In sweetening his initial proposal, which promised the borough 31,950 seats, the Chancellor is trying to break a political deadlock among the seven members of the Board of Education. The board missed the state's March 1 deadline for approving the plan because the representative from Queens, Terri Thomson, and her patron, Borough President Claire Shulman, objected so strenuously to the November draft.

Although the new plan, offered yesterday, would add space by 2004 for a total of 67,700 students throughout the city by building dozens of new schools and adding to existing ones, overcrowding would merely be eased, not eliminated. The overall need has been estimated at 53,500 in Queens alone.

No other borough would have to give up new classroom seats to accommodate Queens, the Chancellor's aides said. But there would still be a substantial trade-off: if approved, the plan would eliminate all 21,566 new computers that were to have been installed -- four to a class -- in every fourth- and fifth-grade classroom in the city.
