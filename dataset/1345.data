RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. — The technology elite gathered for the annual AllThingsD conference here to discuss everything from the mood in Silicon Valley, to the latest technology gadgets and services. Here are a few highlights.

Zynga no-show

Mark Pincus, the chief executive of Zynga, was scheduled to speak at the conference. But Mr. Pincus told conference hosts Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg last week that he couldn’t make it. Mr. Pincus didn’t give “any reason whatsoever” for his absence, the hosts said. That, of course, got people talking. And on the conference floor, what I heard most often is that Mr. Pincus didn’t show because Zynga is about to file for a public offering.

Zynga has declined to comment about its plans for an I.P.O. plans, but people briefed on the company’s plans have said that it may file as soon as this month.

I.P.O.s everywhere or nowhere?

On the heels of the LinkedIn public offering, the parade of hot Internet companies presenting at the D9 conference were asked about their I.P.O. plans. Dick Costolo, the chief executive of Twitter, would not comment, despite persistent questions about it. Andrew Mason, the chief executive of Groupon, declined to answer. Next, Jack Dorsey gave what was probably the best answer to the I.P.O. question. “Which one?” Mr. Dorsey is chief executive of Square, the hot mobile payments startup, and he is also chairman and head of product at Twitter. Of course, he also declined to comment on any specific I.P.O. plans.

The public offerings of Groupon, Zynga and others are coming and are certain to fuel more talk of a bubble. In the meantime, LinkedIn closed at $77.45, down 5 percent on Wednesday. Shares are down 37 percent from their peak of $122.70, and below the opening price of $83 on May 19, its first day of trading.

Groupon zingers

The audience consensus was that Mr. Mason gave the best interview, explaining his company’s business and answering questions with poise and humor. When asked why he didn’t sell Groupon to Google, which last year offered about $6 billion for the company, he answered with an expressionless stare (some in the audience called it the “death stare”).

He also delivered a few good zingers. Asked about competition from Google, which began testing its Offers product in Portland, Ore., on Wednesday, he that he was particularly impressed with one thing: “The Buzz integration is seamless,” he said. For those who have forgotten, Buzz is Google’s spectacularly failed attempt to build a social network on top of Gmail. Finally he responded to a question about Groupon’s potential by saying that the entire retail economy was more than $12 trillion, and that if Groupon could get 10 percent of that, he’d be happy.

Ricoh’s pad demo

Ricoh, the Japanese maker of cameras, copiers and printers, is the latest entrant in the tablet market, which is dominated by Apple’s iPad. But rather than going head-to-head with the iPad, Ricoh’s eWriter Solution is a lightweight e-Ink tablet that looks more like a large-screen Kindle that you can write on. Ricoh said the tablet is a replacement for clipboards and paper forms that are still widely used in businesses. You may use it to fill out forms at the doctor’s office, to sign for a delivery of a package or by an insurance adjuster filling a form for a new claim. The flip side of its limitations is that it is very simple to use. “It was designed to be so simple that people could walk out with it and know how to use it,” said Ron Barr, vice president of marketing for Ricoh. It will cost $500 and come with a set of services that will allow companies to manage the tablets and will be available in summer.

Fanhattan search



Trying to decide what to watch on your iPad is not easy. You have to go app by app — say Netflix, iTunes, and others — to see what’s available. Fanhattan, a new free iPad app, allows you to search through all major apps in one go. If you search for “127 Hours” for example, it will show you all the apps where the movie is available. Clicking through to reviews and previews is easy, and the service works for both movies and television shows. It reminded me of Clicker.com, a service for searching and discovering Web video that was acquired by CBS in March. While Fanhattan works on the iPad only, Gilles BianRosa, the chief executive, said the company plans to make a similar app for Internet connected televisions.

Inkling textbooks



I also got a peek at Inkling, a new iPad app that will be unveiled on Thursday and that offers college students digital versions of their textbooks. Inkling has worked with some major textbook publishers to turn some of their titles into interactive books that look beautiful on the iPad and include video and audio. Matt MacInnis, founder and chief executive of Inkling, was a longtime employee at Apple, where he worked in market development for educational products. He said that by fall, Inkling will have about 100 of the most used textbooks. The company is backed by Sequoia Capital, and a chorus of angel investors. It will compete with Kno, which is also working to digitize textbooks for tablets and was unveiled at the same conference last year.

Say cheese

Speaking of Sequoia-backed companies, another one was introduced at the conference on Wednesday. The Melt, describes itself as an innovative, fast, casual restaurant. It was founded by Jonathan Kaplan, the creator of the Flip Video business, and is opening with four locations in the San Francisco area. It plans to expand to 500 outlets in five years. The Melt let attendees taste its grilled cheese sandwiches, which were definitely more analog than digital.
