Shahar Peer, seeded 18th, defeated No. 13 Nicole Vaidisova in a third-set tiebreaker, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (5), winning on her fourth match point when Vaidisova put a forehand into the net. Peer, a 20-year-old from Israel, had served for the match at 5-3 but didn’t collapse after Vaidisova, an 18-year-old Czech, had broken her.

The match took 2 hours 32 minutes and guaranteed that James Blake would have a second late evening. He didn’t walk on the court for his match against Stefan Koubek until 10:17 p.m. His second-round victory over Fabrice Santoro, Blake’s first triumph in a five-setter, ended after midnight Friday.

Peer’s victory completed a tumultuous day for the bottom half of the women’s draw, with No. 2 Maria Sharapova among those being knocked out in the third round. These are its fourth-round matchups, from the top:

Agnes Szavay vs. Julia Vakulenko

Victoria Azarenka vs. No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova, the only champion left on this side of the draw

No. 6 Anna Chakvetadze vs. Tamira Paszek

No. 18 Shahar Peer vs. No. 30 Agnieszka Radwanska

The bottom half had already been considered weaker than the top half, which has these enticing fourth-round matchups on Sunday:

No. 1 Justine Henin vs. No. 15 Dinara Safina (first match for Sunday’s night session)

No. 8 Serena Williams vs. No. 10 Marion Bartoli (first Ashe match, day session)

No. 3 Jelena Jankovic vs. No. 19 Sybille Bammer (fourth on Armstrong; not before 3 p.m. and possibly moved to Ashe)

No. 5 Ana Ivanovic vs. No. 12 Venus Williams (third Ashe match)

Also, No. 2 Rafael Nadal faces Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the match after Bartoli-Serena. The men’s night match is No. 3 Novak Djokovic vs. Juan Martin Del Potro.
