Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem became the first affiliate of General Motors to seek Chapter 11 protection as the carmaker prepares for a massive government-sponsored restructuring.

The dealership, which Reuters noted is owned by G.M., a rarity, filed for bankruptcy in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan. While G.M. has not yet filed — it is expected to do so around 8 a.m. — the company described G.M. as a “debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11.” (Read the filing after the jump.)

Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem listed more than $1 billion in liabilities. It is seeking to retain a slew of advisers who are also representing G.M., including the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges and the investment banks Evercore Partners and the Blackstone Group.

Its largest creditors were listed as the Wilmington Trust Company, representing holders of nearly $22.8 billion of bond debt, and affiliates of the United Automobile Workers union, representing nearly $20.6 billion in employee obligations.

Reuters noted that according to federal bankruptcy rules, companies have one of three criteria to fulfill to file a Chapter 11 case in a particular district. G.M. is incorporated in Delaware, and its principal place of business is in Michigan. So in order to avail itself of the New York court system, it needed an affiliate that had already filed for bankruptcy in that district.
