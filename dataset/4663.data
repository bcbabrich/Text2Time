A United Nations envoy called today for the Security Council to send more peacekeeping soldiers to Bosnia and Herzegovina and give them new powers to counter abuses including the practice known as "ethnic cleansing" that has made refugees of scores of thousands of Bosnians, mainly Muslims.

The envoy, former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland, said the United Nations peacekeepers were powerless to prevent the "massive and grave violations of human rights occurring throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina."

Blaming all sides in the conflict for such abuses, Mr. Mazowiecki's report singles out the fate of Bosnia's beleaguered Muslims as being "particularly tragic" because "they feel that they are threatened with extermination."

The former Polish Prime Minister, who was sent to the Balkans by the United Nations Human Rights Commission to investigate violations, said the United Nations should send more peacekeeping forces to the region, let them patrol the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and order them to "react directly" to human rights violations, assisting victims and reporting on all atrocities they witness.
