Mexico's Supreme Court is ordering the government of President Vicente Fox to investigate the 1968 massacre of student demonstrators by government troops here in the capital, perhaps the darkest chapter of recent Mexican history.

Neither the government nor the military has ever officially acknowledged the gravity of the killings on Oct. 2, 1968, on the eve of the Olympic Games in Mexico City. No one has ever been charged. Official history texts used in Mexico's schools, printed by the government, erase the event.

Historians and human-rights activists say roughly 300 people died, and perhaps 1,000 were injured, when plainclothes government snipers fired on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. News of the event was suppressed and fire hoses washed the blood from the plaza. The government admitted to fewer than 30 deaths, and maintained that the students opened fire.

The little documentation that has surfaced suggests that the killing was orchestrated at the highest levels of the government, with the intent of suppressing political unrest that might embarrass Mexico before the world.
