Fifteen years ago, polio struck the young American pi anist Carol Rosenberger while she was studying in France. But Miss Rosenberger, who made her New York recital de but at Alice Tully Hall on Tues day night, turned that formid able hurdle into a catapult. In every way, her recovery has been complete, and then some.

The attractive blonde's play ing disclosed no technical weakness of any kind, not even in the thorniest thickets of Beethoven's final sonata, tile Olympian C minor (Op. 111). The tricky transitions in the Arietta were not only smooth but highly musical, and she avoided communicating any feeling of pianistic strain in the finale's strenuous trilling, which so often distracts the listener from Beethoven's more interesting communications. Her Op. 111, while perhaps not as noble or ethereal as it some day may be and too concerned with tidiness, came together nicely. At the other end of the

Beethoven spectrum were the Bagatelles (0o. 119). some of which are literally child's play of a grand sort. The Detroit born pianist kept things in per spective, and the pieces sang elegantly. Here touches of blandness and an occasional tendency to miniaturize were less out of place than in Op. 111, where they also could be heard.

The remainder of the pro gram ranged the side roads of the 20th century post‐romantic literature. Szymanowski's 12 Etudes (Op. 33) rippled flaw lessly, and Miss Rosenberger's fluent technique — she has wrists as supple as snakes— could always be admired, though the pieces themselves remain as a special taste. Faure's Barcarolle No. 5 (Op. 66), also ably played, wanted more warmth of tone and more suggestion of the music's wa tery ebb and flow.
