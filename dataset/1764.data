Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times The multimedia revue of the life and work of Stephen Sondheim that fizzled earlier this year at the Alliance Theater of Atlanta will be plugged back in on Broadway by Roundabout Theater Company. On Thursday, Roundabout said that it would produce “Sondheim on Sondheim,” a project with music and lyrics by Mr. Sondheim, conceived and directed by his frequent collaborator James Lapine. This new work will star Barbara Cook, a Tony Award winner for “The Music Man” (and nominee for her 2002 concert event “Mostly Sondheim”) in her first Broadway musical in more than 37 years, as well as Vanessa Williams (a Tony nominee for “Into the Woods”), Leslie Kritzer (“Rooms: A Rock Romance”) and Michael Arden, with additional cast members to be announced shortly. “Sondheim on Sondheim” is to begin previews on Studio 54 on March 19 with an official opening of April 22. Its limited run concludes on June 13. A roster of songs was not immediately announced. The project at the Alliance Theater, called “iSondheim,” was to have featured music from shows including “Gypsy,” “West Side Story” and “Sweeney Todd,” but was canceled due to fund-raising difficulties.
