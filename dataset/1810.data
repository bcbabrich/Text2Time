CLIVE, Iowa—Mitt Romney has added a new favorite word, freighted with meaning in the context of his back and forth with rival Mike Huckabee, to his political lexicon today: serious.

“We need leaders who will tell us the truth, who are serious, capable individuals who will deal with the challenges we have,” he said at a house party in Ankeny this morning.

He offered this at another home in Johnston: “This is a serious election about serious matters.”

While speaking before another gathering of supporters and others here, Mr. Romney said, “It’s a serious and sober time.”

Why so serious?



Today, of course, is the morning after the national media spectacle in which Mr. Huckabee held a news conference to release an ad attacking Mr. Romney, then announced he was not going to air it but still showed it to the hordes of reporters gathered, many of whom laughed in disbelief at what they were seeing.

Mr. Romney’s campaign has been trying to use Mr. Huckabee’s affability—he is known as the funniest of the presidential candidates by far—against him, portraying him as something of a policy lightweight and sending out critical e-mails on his record entitled, “No Laughing Matter.”

As has been his pattern since his return to Iowa last week, Mr. Romney did not bring up Mr. Huckabee by name during his stump speeches today. But he bore into him again in comments to reporters in Johnston, singling out a comment by Mr. Huckabee on Monday to the Quad City Times in which he appeared to take a shot at President Bush while defending himself from an embarrassing moment for him several weeks ago when he did not know about a new National Intelligence Estimate about Iran’s nuclear program.

“The whole perception was based on an ambush question on the NIE report,” Huckabee said, according to the newspaper. “From there, it was like, ‘Wow.’ That was released at 10 o’clock in the morning. At 5:30 in the afternoon, somebody says, ‘Have you read the report?’ Maybe I should’ve said, ‘Have you read the report?’ President Bush didn’t read it for four years; I don’t know why I should read it in four hours.”

Mr. Romney was scathing in his criticism of Mr. Huckabee’s comments, saying President Bush should instead be commended for “the great work” he is doing.

“I’m not sure whether Governor Huckabee did the attack as a joke, but this is not a time to be mocking our president,” Mr. Romney said. “And it was I think in bad taste. I think we should come together and recognize the great work our president is doing and not take on our rhetoric or our plays from the Democratic playbook. This is the kind of stuff you expect of the Democrats. But it’s certainly not something you’d expect of a presidential contender on the Republican side.

It is a similar line of attack Mr. Romney adopted after Mr. Huckabee published an article in Foreign Affairs last month in which he said the Bush administration was guilty in its foreign policy of an “arrogant bunker mentality.” Mr. Romney, apparently counting on the fact that President Bush remains popular among the Republican base, came swiftly to the president’s defense and said Mr. Huckabee owed President Bush an apology.

Mr. Romney, however, has been walking a delicate tightrope in defending the president while also centering his closing message in Iowa on bringing change to Washington and at times jabbing the Bush administration for its handling of Iraq and Hurricane Katrina.

Separately, with the fourth quarter now completed, Mr. Romney was pressed for a second day by reporters about how much more of his own money did he pump into his campaign.

Mr. Romney, who had given more than $17 million through the third quarter, confirmed for the first time that he had given additional money to his campaign but claimed to not know exactly how much.

“Did I give any more in the fourth quarter as opposed to the third?” he said. “I’m sure I made additional contributions in the fourth quarter but I don’t have any numbers for you.”

Afterward, Eric Fehrnstron, Mr. Romney’s traveling press secretary said Mr. Romney knew “he made a contribution” but did not know how much he had given “exactly.”

“All those numbers are being put together,” Mr. Fehrnstrom said.
