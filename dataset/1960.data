Further problems in the renovation of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow have delayed its planned reopening until 2011, Agence France-Presse reported. The theater, the historic home of the Bolshoi Ballet and Bolshoi Opera, was closed in 2005 to begin a $700 million renovation project to create underground dressing rooms and modernize its stage; the work was to be completed this year, but that target date was later pushed back to 2009. On Monday, Natalya Uvarova, a spokeswoman for the Russian culture ministry, told Agence France-Presse that the latest delays could be “explained mainly by the ground quality, which made it necessary to reinforce the foundations further.” The culture minister, Alexander Avdeyev, told the newspaper Izvestia that the delays were the fault of poor management.
