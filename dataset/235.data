Of course, Taurasi “relaxed” in her own way: She’d work out, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, with weights, flexibility, on-court drills and yoga for what she described as a physical and psychological “three-month reconstruction of myself.”

“It’s a credit to her for all the work that she continues to put into her game and to her body, into her mind, everything,” Mercury Coach Sandy Brondello said. “Because at 36 years of age, to go out and play at the level that she plays at really is amazing. I’m in awe of her sometimes.”

It is a testament to her leadership that her offensive game has evolved in a way that maximizes what Griner, 27, has grown into. Once a pure under-the-basket threat, Griner has developed a feathery touch and a confidence in her ability to take over games that have changed the equation for teams game-planning for the Mercury.

“Everybody’s kind of always had a little bit more faith in my shot than me, and I had to work on it overseas and get comfortable with taking it,” Griner said, noting that she and Taurasi have been teammates for years with UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia. “But then, it also has helped me out a lot just so I don’t have to go down and bang on the block all night long.

“Defenders tend to leave me open on the elbow and when I step out, so it was only the smart thing to do to start to knock down the shots so they can’t leave me open up there.”

The result is a greatly diversified Griner. In the 2014 season, Griner took 55 shots from 11 to 15 feet, making 50.9 percent of them. She had already taken 71 shots from that distance and made 54.9 percent of them before this season’s All-Star break. The difference is even starker from 16 to 21 feet, the spots on the floor vacated by Taurasi. In 2014, Griner shot 1-for-8 from that distance; she was 18-for-41 before the All-Star break this year.
