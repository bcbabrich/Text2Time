Dressed as bride and groom, Hema Sakhrani and Shaleen Wadhwani were mourned yesterday as they lay a few feet from each other in a funeral parlor in Queens. She wore a red sari with gold trim that her uncle had brought from Bombay. He wore a bejeweled turban and a black suit. An orange sash, a symbol of the bond between man and woman in Hindu marriage rites, joined the two coffins.

Their parents held two services for the young couple, whose lives had seemed so promising until a man who the police said was obsessed with Miss Sakhrani gunned down Mr. Wadhwani last Wednesday. She was so overcome by grief that she killed herself two days later.

Early yesterday morning, there was a kind of wedding ceremony. Later, several hundred relatives and friends crowded into the same room for the funeral. July Wedding Was Planned

Mr. Wadhwani and Miss Sakhrani, both 20, were students at New York University who fell in love and planned to marry on July 16. He was about to start medical school on a full scholarship. She excelled in chemistry. Their parents, immigrants from India and Pakistan, reveled in their children's happiness.
