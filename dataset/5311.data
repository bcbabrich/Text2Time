To the Editor:

''A Verdict on the Vincennes'' (editorial, Aug. 4) questions the adequacy of the detection equipment aboard the cruiser Vincennes, despite the Navy's opinion that there were no problems with it. This points to the real cause of the tragedy in the Persian Gulf.

The Vincennes has been described as a billion-dollar ship with the world's most advanced electronic equipment. If all that this high-tech gear can do is confuse the crew and let it come to numerous false conclusions and make wrong decisions, then obviously this gear is not as sophisticated as the Navy thinks it is.

The purpose of the investigations and post-mortems should be to prevent recurrence of such disasters. Begin that by investigating the soundness of the Navy's equipment requirements and the contractors' degree of compliance, not the crew's state of mind. HERMAN LEIBOWITZ Bayside, Queens, Aug. 18, 1988
