To the Editor:

Your criticism of United States departure from the United Nations General Assembly during the speech by the Iranian president (Topics, Sept. 24) misrepresents diplomatic practice and United Nations history. The walkout by Herbert S. Okun, deputy United States representative, leading the delegation, was justified. It was Iran that broke the rules. Neither United Nations practice nor diplomatic convention requires a country to sit still for personal diatribes against its chief of state, open threats of terrorism, or appeals for the naked use of force. President Ali Khamenei did all of that and more.

Further, your comparison of the walkout to Soviet boycotts of the Security Council is incorrect. When the Russians walked out of the Security Council in 1950, they stopped participating in its work. The United States is participating fully in the work of the General Assembly. We returned to our seats as soon as the Iranian speech ended.
