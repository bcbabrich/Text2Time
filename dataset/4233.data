To the Editor:

I read with concern Amnesty International's Oct. 30 letter about its visits to Cuba. Though Amnesty observers were allowed into Cuba on three occasions, they have been denied permission to visit with prisoners -- a minimum standard for any human rights investigation. More important, Fidel Castro has never permitted the principal Latin American human rights organization, Americas Watch, to enter Cuba.

Mr. Castro, in his Times interview (news article, Oct. 26), casually admitted to imprisoning at least 600 political dissidents. For their sake, I wish he were as casual about allowing human rights observers to visit them.
