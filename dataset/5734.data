President Reagan has moved to give more prestige to the delegation he sent to Geneva to negotiate arms reduction with the Soviet Union. To impress the Russians with the caliber of the delegation, the President has given what is called ''personal rank of Ambassador'' to four deputies and one coordinator at the talks.

The ranks, given to people on special missions, carry no pay increase and are valid for only six months. The recipients are checked by the F.B.I. before the President gives them the titles, and he sends their names to the Senate, but the Senate need not advise or consent.

The new holders of the personal rank are John A. Woodworth, Warren Zimmerman, Lewis A. Dunn, Henry F. Cooper and Ronald F. Lehman 2d.

''There are no perks involved,'' said Herman J. Cohen, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Personnel. ''These guys are there for that mission, and the ranks are for the benefit of their counterparts on the opposite side. They show that we're serious about these negotiations.''
