Though there was once a time when Netflix was most closely associated with its bright red DVD-return envelopes, the company — now better known as a video-streaming service — is hoping that orange will be its color this summer. On Tuesday, Netflix announced that it has scheduled its next original series, “Orange Is the New Black,” a comedy-drama set in a women’s prison, to have its premiere on July 11; and, as has become its custom, it will make all thirteen episodes of the series available for viewing at once.

Adapted from Piper Kerman’s memoir of the same title, “Orange Is the New Black” chronicles a Brooklyn woman (played by Taylor Schilling) whose relationship with a drug runner (Laura Prepon) gets her sentenced to a year in prison. The series, which also stars Jason Biggs, Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne and Pablo Schreiber, is created by Jenji Kohan, who previously mined laughs from law-breaking women as the creator of the Showtime comedy “Weeds.”

“Orange Is the New Black” will be the fourth original series that Netflix has introduced this year, following its hit political drama “House of Cards,” its suspense thriller “Hemlock Grove” and its new season of “Arrested Development,” which will have its debut on May 26.
