If the first thing you look for in fiction is a clean, uncluttered story line, Mr. Kiely is not really your man. Even hardened admirers are likely to be a bit disconcerted, to start with at least, by the narrative fits and starts of this particular story, ''Eton Crop.'' But if the compensations of Mr. Kiely's rich, witty, allusive prose are enough to keep you going, you will eventually find that everything falls into place, and that what you are left with is a touching story of first love -all the more touching for its absurdities.

Mr. Kiely's roots as a writer go back to the folk tradition in which the telling is as important as the tale. He embroiders, digresses, plays fantastic variations on his chosen refrains. His narratives are larded with puns and parodies, literary tags, fragments of pop songs, curious scraps of learning. The colors are bright, the jokes dart in unexpected directions.

Occasionally he overdoes it, and his meanderings get the better of him. There are one or two stories in ''A Letter to Peachtree'' where you can't see the nucleus for the electrons. But they are very much the exceptions. For the most part, he remains firmly in charge, fashioning a series of coherent, self-contained worlds.

Odd worlds, some of them - none odder than the world of the unnamed hero, if that is the right word for him, in the story ''Through the Fields in Gloves.'' Outwardly he is a dingy Dublin shopkeeper, but he also leads another life as ''Peter the Painter,'' a molester who gets his kicks by assaulting young women with a paintspray. An unpleasant enough theme: but the story is so powerfully imagined, with such an unerring mixture of the humdrum and the bizarre, that its fascination never slackens.

A milder glimpse of sex gone awry is provided by a story called ''Secondary Top.'' Letters have started reaching the authorities complaining that a schoolmaster in a provincial town in Ireland has been showing undue interest in the girls he teaches. Two inspectors are sent out to investigate, incognito, and come up with a benign solution to the problem - though we can never be quite sure how far the teacher is a victim himself. The whole story, at once high-spirited and faintly ominous, is a small masterpiece of ambiguity.
