To the Editor:

You describe the academic dispute over ''The Collapse of the Weimar Republic: Political Economy and Crisis'' by Prof. David Abraham, in which he argues, as you report, that conflicts within German industry and agriculture led big business as a class to turn against the Weimar Republic and choose Hitler as their surest route to economic revival (''A Quarrel Over Weimar Book,'' Dec. 23).

At the Nuremberg trials of industrialists (the I. G. Farben cartel and Krupp), they were charged with participating in the preparation and waging of aggressive war, technically referred to in the indictment as ''crimes against peace.''

Among the documents at those trials was a report of a meeting at Hermann G"oring's house on Feb. 20, 1933, of the leading industrialists of Germany, where the speaker was Hitler and the host Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, former president of the Reichsbank. In Gustav Krupp's confidential file of private correspondence was found a report of the Hitler and G"oring speeches.

Hitler was reported as having said, ''The Weimar Government imposed upon us a certain constitutional order by which they put us on a democratic basis. By that we were, however, not provided with an able governmental authority. . . . Now we stand before the last election. Regardless of the outcome, there will be no retreat if the coming election does not bring about a decision. One way or another, if the election does not decide, the decision will simply have to be brought about by other means.'' G"oring then asked industry to make financial sacrifices to contribute to Hitler. G"oring said, Krupp reported, ''The sacrifices asked for would be so much easier for industry to bear if it is realized that the election of March 5 would surely be the last one for the next 10 years, probably for the next 100 years.'' Dr. Schacht stated in an interrogation that ''all the prominent industrialists and bankers'' were present.
