Photography introduced a number of new subjects to the pictorial canon and then revised some old ones radically. Refugees, for instance: throughout history, wars and politically repressive regimes have left refugees in their wake, but the search for safe haven and the condition of refugees have seldom been painted. The holy family on the flight to Egypt is the exception, a kind of ur representation that usurped all others and did not call for pity alone.

Photography in the 20th century changed the picture. Every war and many of the uprisings since World War I have called forth pictures of civilians thronging the crowded and hazardous paths to safety. Compassion is expected of the viewer. In recent times the press and television have been glutted with images of starving, emaciated, ragged people in wretched camps standing in interminable lines for a bit of sustenance, awaiting death with distended stomachs.

Horrible as these pictures are, they are almost cliches by now. Fazal Sheikh photographs refugees without them. The International Center of Photography showed his photographs of African refugee camps in 1996; what was striking was the dignity of the people, who faced Mr. Sheikh's camera not only with utter seriousness but also with a sense of self, even perhaps of self-worth, that outshone their desperation and seemed to have outlasted self-pity.

Since then, Mr. Sheikh has photographed Afghans in exile in Pakistan. Pace Wildenstein MacGill Gallery has 53 of these pictures on view in ''Fazal Sheikh: The Victor Weeps.'' (Scalo has published a book of the same title.) Again, these are strong, sober, contemplative and respectful portraits rather than scenes of misery, although a few views of the ruins of the Afghan capital, Kabul, which Mr. Sheikh also managed to visit just before the Taliban moved in, make it painfully clear that misery must have been in abundant supply. More than six million people, almost half the nation, fled Afghanistan during the war, and by 1997 some 2.7 million were still in exile.
