President Boris N. Yeltsin's resignation today drove Russian stocks to their highest levels since the 1998 economic collapse, reflecting hope among investors that the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, would revive stalled economic reforms.

The Russian Trading System stock index, the main stock market barometer in the country, rose 18 percent to 177.71. The increase was the greatest one-day jump since July 14, 1998, when the International Monetary Fund agreed to lend Russia $22.8 billion.

But a month later, the Russian economy collapsed. Since then, the market had languished, with periodic rallies occurring on very low volumes.

Russian stocks traded in the United States rallied today as well. Shares of the cellular provider Vimpel Communications, the first Russian company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rose 24.2 percent to $41. The Templeton Russia Fund, a mutual fund that invests primarily in Russian companies, rose 35 percent to $19.9375.
