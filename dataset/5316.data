When Franklin Roosevelt nominated Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme Court, in 1939, voices of the extreme right called Professor Frankfurter a Communist. They cited, especially, the fact that he was a member of a national committee of the American Civil Liberties Union.

On Jan. 12, 1939, Frankfurter himself appeared as a witness before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee: a break from the traditional practice of Supreme Court nominees. The questions, begun by Senator William E. Borah, Republican of Idaho, focused on his association with the A.C.L.U.

Frankfurter explained how the Civil Liberties Union had come into being after World War I, a time of public hysteria about supposed radical plots. He had been a Federal prosecutor, Frank-furter said, and he knew about the dangers of power in official hands. He knew the need for ''a group of people whose special job it should be to be watchful [ of ] the Bill of Rights.''

As an example of his role, he said the A.C.L.U. had consulted him about whether to help the Ku Klux Klan when Boston officials tried to stop it from holding a parade. ''I said, 'Of course civil liberty means liberty for those whom we do not like or even detest.' '' (He was surely paraphrasing a passage in one of his favorite opinions by Justice Holmes: ''If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought - not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.'') Senator Borah asked about the relationship of the A.C.L.U. to Communism.
