Since the nation's securities laws require insiders to report their stock market trades to the S.E.C. by the 10th day of the month following the trade, investors have been able to follow their activity, picking up signals on both the trend of the market and the desirability of individual companies.

''Insiders obviously know things about their own companies that are hidden from outsiders,'' says Norman G. Fosback, editor of The Insiders, a twice-monthly newsletter published out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that tracks insider buying and selling. ''They know if business will be good or bad. They know whether profits are about to rise or fall. They know in advance about takeovers and mergers. In short, they know when to buy or sell their stock.''

Edwin A. Buck, editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published out of Brookside, N.J., added: ''The insiders have been absolutely fantastic. They have called every major turn in the market 85 percent of the time, and they have never been wrong when it is time to buy.''

But analysts caution against thinking everything the insiders are buying is golden and recommend that investors be sure to diversify across several industries. ''Insiders have been buying a lot of banking stocks, but they're not infallible,'' Mr. Fosback said. ''So if seven out of 10 of the stocks in your portfolio are banks, and banks get hit, you're in trouble.'' Still, insiders' record in recent years has been impressive indeed. From the second half of 1981 through the first half of 1982, as the Dow Jones industrial average slid from above 1,000, down to almost 800, insider buying activity was exceedingly heavy, reaching some of its highest levels on record. Sure enough, the market took off in early August 1982 to break 1,300 by the end of 1983. But beginning early in 1983, the insiders were selling heavily, taking profits and predicting the 1984 stall in the Dow and the market in general.

But as investors were discouraged in 1984, the insiders began buying again, just before the 1985 bull market. Again, they sold in the first half of 1985 - taking profits - until mid-year, when ''buying reached almost record levels,'' Mr. Fosback said.

Insiders have also been accurate in picking groups of stocks that were about to do well. Over the last year, corporate executives of savings and loan associations heavily bought stock in their companies, and the thrift unit industry overall was one of the top-performing sectors for 1985.In terms of selling, the insiders have been unloading computer companies, chemical companies, hotels and restaurants and packaged food makers.

''But now things are very turned around, they are starting to sell very heavily,'' said J. Michael Reid, who publishes Insider Indicators out of his home in Portland, Ore. Mr. Reid noted that of insider trades of stocks included on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, there have been 112 sell transactions in recent weeks, compared with only one purchase - some of the highest selling in years.
