The decision this week by the Screen Actors Guild to identify open-mouth kissing as dangerous work out of fear that it may increase the risk of AIDS infection has set the stage for a confrontation between actors and producers.

Many people in the film industry are afraid that the new rule will trigger a backlash against homosexuals. Medical authorities have identified homosexuals, intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs as the groups with the highest risk of being infected by the virus that causes AIDS.

Carol Akiyama, senior vice president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, said, ''We do sympathize with the concerns of SAG's members. However, we feel their approach is not appropriate. It contains conclusions that are not supported by the medical evidence. There are no reported cases of AIDS being transmitted by saliva or tears or open-mouth kissing.''

Under the new rule, producers are required to tell actors before they are hired, if the part includes an open-mouth kissing scene. However, in an effort to avoid discrimination, the actor or actress is not to be told who will be kissed in the scene.
