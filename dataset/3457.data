America's economic boom -- already the second longest on record -- shows no signs of flagging.

Despite a decline in auto production and another sharp deterioration in the trade balance, the United States economy grew at a surprisingly robust 4.5 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 1999, the Government reported yesterday.

That is the sort of heady pace usually associated with the first, not the ninth, year of an economic expansion. Moreover, most forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, had been expecting a visible slowdown from the previous quarter's frenetic 6 percent rate.

''This economy continues to defy the aging process,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company in Boston. ''The only discernible weakness is the trade deficit. And this has merely slowed the economy from warp speed.''

A burst of domestic spending fueled last quarter's gains. Consumers, who account for more than two-thirds of the nation's buying, spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Home purchases shot up at an annual rate above 15 percent. And business investment in new plant and equipment, which had faltered last summer, continued to rebound, advancing at a 7.6 percent rate.
