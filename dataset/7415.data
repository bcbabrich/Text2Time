JOSEPH SCHMIDT: tenor (Capitol T 10367). The extraordinarily brilliant tenor voice of the diminutive Joseph Schmidt (1904‐42) is heard here in the music he waa forced to sing because he was less than 5 feet tall. Because he could not appear successfully on the opera stage, radio became his only outlet, and this disk's selections —popular German songs and excerpts from films and operettas from the tenor's days with the Berlin radio in the 1930's—not only furnish examples of the radiant voice but are also a documentaryof German popular music before the Second World War. There is no depression reflected in the gay tunes and waltzes nor much originality. The album is chiefly recommended for those interested in freak voices of phenomenal range andbrilliance.
