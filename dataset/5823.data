Airports, seaports and border posts have been closed and both telephone and telex communications with Nigeria have been cut.

President Shagari began his second term only three months ago after Nigeria's first civilian-run elections. Elections in 1979 had been conducted by the army. The election campaign this year was a remarkably open and freewheeling affair and the elections themselves, though marred by irregularities, were viewed as an exercise in democracy.

''There were instances of fraud by all the parties involved in the elections,'' a Nigerian commentator said. ''But I don't think anyone can seriously claim that Shagari would have lost had all the rigging been eliminated.''

Scattered outbreaks of violence after the elections were quickly extinguished, and the courts overturned some results as fraudulent. In recent months, the situation has been generally calm.

Mr. Shagari had pledged to wage an aggressive fight against corruption and inefficiency during what, under the Constitution, would have had to be his final term in office.

Nigeria History

With a population of 85 million, Nigeria is the most populous African country. Its vast natural resources, particularly its rich oil reserves, have made it one of the most economically and politically important countries on the continent's West coast.

Nigeria was one of Britain's major colonial prizes in Africa. British traders and missionaries initially worked their way up the Niger River, forerunners of the British rule that began in 1861. However, it was not until the 1920's that the amalgamation of Nigeria's diverse tribal groups in a single colony and protectorate was finally accomplished.
