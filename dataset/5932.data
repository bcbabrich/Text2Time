THERE is a category of foods that has been labeled plebeian, peasant style and bourgeois. These foods are also referred to at times as nourishing and stick-to-the-ribs. They are the most basic, country-style, garden-variety vegetables, such as carrots and cabbage, cauliflower and kale, brussels sprouts and broccoli.

Despite the knockabout labels attached to such foods, they can be prepared in ways that make them casual and delectable and, at once, fit for the finest of tables. This is particularly worth stressing now because these vegetables and others like them have recently been recommended by an expert panel of the National Academy of Sciences.

In a report on the link between nutrition and cancer made public this summer, the panel urged Americans to eat less fat and very few salt-cured, pickled and smoked foods, and to eat more vegetables, fruits and whole grains to reduce the risk of cancer.

Dark green leafy vegetables and deep yellow vegetables -those same ''plebeian'' foods so often taken for granted - were especially recommended because they are rich sources both of beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A, and of vitamin C. Those vegetables include broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage and cauliflower. Of these, only cauliflower is not high in vitamin A or C. Foods high in carotene are associated with a reduced risk of many cancers, including cancer of the lung, breast, bladder and skin. Vitamin Crich foods seem to lower the risk of cancer of the stomach and esophagus.
