While China was a partner of Western countries in the early stages of the Persian Gulf crisis, it has stepped back from the coalition since the fighting began and some diplomats worry that the split with the West could deepen.

The fissure is not expected to widen to the point that Beijing would use its seat on the Security Council to cause major difficulties for the coalition. But even mild Chinese criticism of the allied forces would weaken the sense of international alliance against Iraq and could increase the perception in the third world that Western countries are ganging up against a smaller nation.

When the crisis erupted in August, China joined the West in condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and in imposing United Nations sanctions against the Government of President Saddam Hussein. These days, Chinese officials still call for an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, but in the next breath they call on the allied forces to show restraint.

"We are extremely concerned over the possible escalation of the war," said Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, last week, "and we urge the two belligerent parties to exercise the maximum restraint to prevent the war from spreading and expanding, so as to create the necessary conditions for the efforts to find a peaceful solution."
