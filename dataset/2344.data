OSLO - The newspaper cartoons here often portray Per-Kristian Foss, the finance minister of Norway, buoyed by a spouting geyser of oil. Sometimes they show him bathing in vats of cash. It is easy to see why.

Quietly and with characteristic modesty, Norway has turned the income from 3.3 million barrels a day of offshore oil production into a government-owned investment fund that recently, for the first time, topped one trillion kroner, or about $165 billion.

That makes it one of the world's richest funds, in the same league as the $180 billion fund of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the biggest public pension system in the United States, and only slightly smaller than ABP, the Dutch pension fund, which has more than $200 billion in assets.

Yet there may be trouble ahead.

Much as economic managers like Mr. Foss relish the oil income that has made Norwegian budget deficits a thing of the past, they are also coming to terms with another reality. As in the United States and much of western Europe, aging baby boomers in Norway represent a pension time bomb, creating worries akin to those that are pressing the Bush administration to deal with the unfinanced promises of Social Security.
