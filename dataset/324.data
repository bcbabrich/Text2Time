For William, 20, a junior from Birmingham, Ala., her awakening during this tournament has been a validation of her skill and a rebuke to the countless people who told her she was too short to play major college basketball. After averaging 9.6 points for her career, William scored 41 in a regional final a week ago against Baylor. And then she dribbled three times to the right of the lane just before overtime expired on Friday and hit a 15-foot jumper, sending Mississippi State’s players and fans into delirium.

In that moment, William did what every child who ever played basketball in the driveway or shot at a hoop nailed to a barn has dreamed of and rehearsed — counting the time down, hitting the winning shot and hearing the crowd erupt with the sound of something decisive and astounding.

“Sometimes all it takes is one kid to go into a completely different zone, and they can carry a team through an entire tournament,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “It happens. That kid averaged 9 points a game during the season. This isn’t the regular season. She doesn’t have to do it for the next five months.” Just for one more night.

“That’s a whole different dynamic,” he said.

Auriemma met William at a Final Four banquet on Wednesday night and said he told her: “That’s what the N.C.A.A. tournament’s all about, for kids to throw themselves into the national spotlight. It’s the chance of a lifetime, and you’re taking advantage of it.”

But her career has not followed the same smooth arc as her winning shot on Friday.

When William was a senior in high school in Birmingham in 2014, her stepfather, Donnie Rory, died of a heart attack. He had played football at Samford University in Alabama and had encouraged his stepdaughter to play basketball. She could play in the S.E.C., he told her, and could be the best point guard in the conference. “Every time I play basketball, I think about him,” William said. “He put the ball in my hand when I was 3, and I ran from there.”

At Mississippi State, she found the understanding of Schaefer, who had lost both his parents. William rooms with Schaefer’s daughter, Blair, a reserve guard on the team, and often eats dinner at the Schaefer household.
