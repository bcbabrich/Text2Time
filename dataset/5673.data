To the Editor:

Your Dec. 16 editorial ''The Chinese Correction'' is misleading in creating a myth that Communist China's leaders have entered upon a new path they regard as ''a nameless new ism.''

Let us have no illusion about Deng Xiaoping. In a speech to the Communist Party 12th Central Committee, never reported but later printed in Taiwan's ''Issues & Studies'' (April 1984), Deng revealed himself as a dedicated Marxist. He argued for a thorough cleaning of the party to remove economic criminals, corrupt cadres, and those who refused to toe the new party line - the Maoists.

Deng then insisted that spiritual pollution on the ideological front had to be brought under control. On economic reform and cultural exchange with the West, he said:

''In economy, we adopt a policy of two hands - on the one hand, it's opening up; on the other hand, there must not be blind, unplanned and non- selective importing; moreover, we cannot but resolutely resist the corrosive influences of capitalism. In cultural exchange, why should we let the pernicious things in the capitalist culture move freely?'' Deng frequently urged party members to ''re-strengthen their party spirit,'' saying if the leadership of Marxism were re-strengthened, problems on the ideological front could be solved. The shocking misreporting of the Dec. 7 People's Daily editorial ''Theory and Practice'' again shows how the West has misunderstood Peking's current intent. That editorial simply argues for developing Marxism to fit new conditions and to modernize China - a Maoism for sure. At one point the author states ''one should not adopt a dogmatic attitude toward Marxism.'' In essence, the editorial is an appeal for integrating theory and practice to improve administration. It makes no mention of abandoning basic Marxism-Leninism.

China's leaders intend to follow the road toward socialism and communism. They will eschew excess Maoist leftism and ''creeping capitalism.''
