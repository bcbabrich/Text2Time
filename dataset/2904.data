The White House press secretary this morning blamed former President Bill Clinton for the continuing violence in the Middle East, causing denunciations from former Clinton aides, but he quickly reversed himself and by midafternoon issued a retraction.

''No United States president, including President Clinton, is to blame for violence in the Middle East,'' Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said in a statement e-mailed to reporters shortly after 3 p.m. ''The only people to blame for violence are the terrorists who engage it.''

He added, ''I regret any implication to the contrary.''

At a morning briefing with White House reporters, Mr. Fleischer had strongly implied that the Clinton administration had pushed Israelis and Palestinians too far in aggressive efforts to make peace.

''Actually, I think if you go back to when the violence began, you can make the case that in an attempt to shoot the moon and get nothing, more violence resulted,'' Mr. Fleischer said, adding that ''as a result of an attempt to push the parties beyond where they were willing to go, that it led to expectations that were raised to such a high level that it turned into violence.''
