Swimming heads the list of 40 participant sports in a survey taken in 1987 by the National Sporting Goods Association. More than 66 million Americans took the plunge last year, and swimming was followed in the poll by exercise walking (58.1 million), which drew the most new participants (7.2 million).

A participant is defined as someone 7 years of age or older who plays a sport more than once during a year. In swimming, exercise walking, bicycling, exercising with equipment, running and jogging, and aerobics, the participant must have engaged in the activity six times or more during the year.
