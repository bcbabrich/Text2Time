Russia's Prime Minister said in a television interview tonight that the country ''so far'' did not need emergency international loans to pull itself out of its financial crisis.

President Clinton said today that the United States would support new international financial assistance for Russia if it was unable to meet short-term debts. Although the interview with Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko, broadcast tonight on a popular Sunday news program, had been taped before Mr. Clinton's statement, the President's support had been sought by key members and backers of the Russian Government.

The most important reaction to Mr. Clinton's statement, though, was expected to come on Monday morning, in the response of Russian financial markets to the United States' endorsement of more help for Russia.

That news follows an announcement on Friday that a new installment of a $10 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund had been approved for Russia on the basis of the Government's latest plan to reduce its deficit.
