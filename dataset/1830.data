When the Clinton campaign plane took off from Texas this afternoon, one person was missing: Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Where was she?

Mrs. Clinton hopped another plane bound for New York where she will appear later tonight on Saturday Night Live, much the way Senator Barack Obama of Illinois did last year. It’s a surprise walk-on, and it comes as Mrs. Clinton is finding new places to take her campaign appeal (She appeared on Comedy Central last week).

In what is perhaps not the greatest bit of show business timing, Mrs. Clinton will be sharing the Saturday Night Live bill with Wilco, the popular alt-country Chicago band which has become one of the biggest boosters of – you guessed it, Mr. Obama. (The Obama stickers could be spotted on the band’s gear when it showed up for a two-night stand at 9:30, the Washington music club this week.)
