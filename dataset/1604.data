To call someone a conspiracy theorist is, in truth, to say something insultingly vague, because as we all know conspiracy theorists come in degrees. On the one hand are the elite squad of paranoids who keep 10 years’ worth of kidney beans in their basements, bite their nails and believe that the North Koreans are lacing our club soda with something dangerously nonnutritive. On the other hand are the languorous crackpots who wonder if codes are embedded in their Home Depot receipts, or if George Washington’s wooden leg hid an alternate Constitution. It is for this group that the series “Brad Meltzer’s Decoded” has been conceived.

If you need to ask, “Who is Brad Meltzer?,” then “Decoded” (starting Thursday on History) isn’t for you. It is a series for those who already share his affinities for pyramid symbols, secret societies, puzzles, missing artifacts, Washington tombs, underground labyrinths, stealth agendas of the founding fathers and so on. They are interests that Mr. Meltzer has made well known in his best-selling novels: legal thrillers with an archival fetish largely devoid of subtext and meant for consumption between Dulles and O’Hare. These are books for which there are television commercials.

The latest, “The Inner Circle,” due next month, is fairly representative of the canon. In it a young government librarian gets into trouble when he shows a pretty girl where the president privately studies classified documents. They accidentally discover a 200-year-old dictionary that lands them, as the book jacket denotes, “in a web of deception, conspiracy, and murder that will reveal the best-kept secret of the U.S. presidency.”

A dictionary! How quaintly pre-yellowcake! And yet it is this same spirit of irrelevance that animates — or, more accurately, enervates — Mr. Meltzer’s television venture. Each episode of “Decoded” seeks to unravel some sort of historical mystery in a key that is something close to “Lost” meets a seventh-grade civics lesson. Mr. Meltzer, bald and laboring to seem professorial, narrates while standing, inexplicably, in front of a chalk board emblazoned with math equations as if he were auditioning for a remake of “A Beautiful Mind” or impersonating Glenn Beck.

His team, meanwhile, is dispatched to do the nitty-gritty work of investigating — digging around in vaults and asking the tough questions. In the premiere these questions are posed to Freemasons and the people who think about them. “What are they hiding?” Christine McKinley, a mechanical engineer, asks a filmmaker with expertise in weird brotherhoods. “Their ultimate agenda, which is the new world order,” he answers.
