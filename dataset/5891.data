TO French cooks, garnishes and decorations have always been important. They can take many forms, from a simple sprig of parsley or watercress to an ice sculpture or a pastry that is molded into an architectural shape and baked.

Recently I prepared a recipe given to me by a friend, Noelle Morris. The dish was breasts of chicken sauteed with mushrooms and given a garnish of cooked artichoke bottoms filled with a puree of sweet red peppers. Although it can be made in an hour, I don't think of it as a dish for a casual meal. It is quite festive and worth fixing for a special occasion. The basic dish is excellent, and the artichoke garnish gives it a special style.

The preparation entails sauteing boneless chicken breasts in butter until cooked through. They are served on a bed of noodles with a white wine and mushroom cream sauce. When the garnish is added, the contrasts both in the colors - the green of the artichokes and the red puree of peppers - and in the flavors will make your guests sit up in admiration. Chicken Noelle (Chicken breasts with artichokes) 8 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 2 red sweet peppers, about 3/4 pound 4 tablespoons butter 1/2 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced, about 3 cups 2 tablespoons chopped shallots 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 pound medium egg noodles 2 quarts boiling water 4 buttered artichoke bottoms (see recipe) 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.

1. Sprinkle pieces of breast meat with salt and pepper and set aside.

2. Cut away the core of each pepper. Cut peppers lengthwise into quarters; discard inner veins and seeds. Put pieces of pepper in a saucepan with water to cover and bring to a boil. Simmer about eight minutes. Drain. In a processor or electric blender, blend the pepper to a fine puree. Pour puree into a small skillet and cook about five minutes. Add one tablespoon of butter.
