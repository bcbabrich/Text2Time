The MetroStars have the worst home record in Major League Soccer, and playing a man short for half the game tonight did not help. They lost, 3-2, to the Columbus Crew before 10,602 fans at Giants Stadium.

Right before intermission, Joe Addo was sent off for fouling Brian Maisonneuve from behind in midfield. It was the sixth ejection of the year for a member of the MetroStars, who are 3-6-2 at home and 6-4-0 on the road.

Defensive breakdowns led to two Columbus goals.

''We're not a good team right now,'' MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''We have some major deficiencies in key areas.

''We need a strong player somewhere, and the mechanisms of this league does not make it available to us,'' he added, referring to the league's control of all player signings.
