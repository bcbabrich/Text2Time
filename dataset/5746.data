A Congressional attempt to rescue the Small Business Administration from termination, as proposed by the White House, is being threatened by a resonant clash of Senate personalities, focused, at least ostensibly, on the issue of officially sanctioned prayer in the public schools.

Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, had drafted a compromise bill that would reduce the cost of the small-business agency $2.5 billion over three years.

The Connecticut Republican, who says the measure would continue the most important functions of the agency, had won support for it from Senate leaders and was prepared last week to bring it to the floor.

But then Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, introduced a proposal to legalize school prayer as an amendment to the Weicker bill, which had the effect of postponing floor action indefinitely. Under these circumstances, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, cannot bring up the business-agency legislation without risking tying up the Senate for weeks on school prayer any time Senator Helms chooses to call up his amendment.
