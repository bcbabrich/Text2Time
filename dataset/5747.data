Jiang Jialiane rebounded from a rare loss in the singles semifinals to win two doubles titles today and lead China to a sweep of all seven major events at the United States Open Table Tennis Championships.

Jiang, the world's No. 1-rated player, teamed with Cao Yanhua to win the mixed doubles and with Cheng Yinghua to take the men's doubles.

One day earlier, Jiang lost to Wu Wen-Chia of Taiwan in the men's singles semifinals. But Cheng upheld China's status as the top country in the sport by beating Wu in the finals.

In today's finals, Jiang and Cao defeated their compatriots, Yinghua and Li Huifeng, 21-18, 18-21, 21-19, for the mixed doubles title. Then Jiang and Yinghua beat Jan-Ove Waldner and Erik Lindh of Sweden, 21-16, 21-7, for the men's doubles title.
