BATESVILLE, Miss., June 30 (AP)—The police arrested an Indiana Negro today for the hit‐and‐run death of an unidentified white man south of here.

The police said that Charles Edward Bond, 23 years old, of Michigan City, Ind., admitted the incident.

The victim, about 25 and of medium build, was struck in several places. A funeral home said that the victim did not resemble any of the civil rights workers missing in the Philadelphia, Miss., area.

The body was found on Interstate Route 55 early today by a woman motorist, who reported to the highway patrol.
