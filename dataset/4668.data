Sam Stickler, the production supervisor for "Les Miserables" and other Broadway shows, died on Monday in Albany. He was 37 years old and lived in Oak Hill, N.Y.

He died of AIDS, said Marc Thibodeau, a spokesman for "Les Miserables."

Mr. Stickler worked with the producer Cameron Mackintosh as the production stage manager for the Broadway revival of "Oliver!" in 1984, "Song and Dance" with Bernadette Peters, and the original Broadway and national touring companies of "Les Miserables." His other Broadway credits include "The Real Thing" and "Hurlyburly."

Mr. Stickler was born in St. Louis and studied at the University of Illinois. He worked as a director at the Candlewood Playhouse and the Darien Dinner Theater, both in Connecticut. He was stage manager for the national touring companies of "Evita" and "Annie," and in 1983 he was the production supervisor for the South American tour of "Evita." He was also a co-owner of a restaurant, Sam's Oak Hill Kitchen.

He is survived by his parents, Lee and Cora Stickler of Elsah, Ill., and a sister, Sara, of Clearwater, Fla.
