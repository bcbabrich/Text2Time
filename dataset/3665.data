While Torre wants his players to be lauded for their achievements, he emphasized that they are focused on team goals instead of personal ones like the All-Star team. Torre spoke with Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove, who will pick the rest of the team, and obviously lobbied for David Wells, who is on schedule to possibly start the game; Hideki Irabu; Paul O'Neill, who finished sixth among the outfielders; Brosius and Jeter. David Cone would be a solid candidate, but he is scheduled to start Sunday against Baltimore, so he will probably not make the team.

Like Torre, the Yankees were not forlorn about being overlooked.

''I think if you ask anybody on this team, the recognition they're interested in is playing on a World Series team, not an All-Star team,'' Brosius said.

Martinez, who had crept ahead of Cleveland's Jim Thome in the voting last week, seemed relieved that he had lost because he wants to rest a nagging shoulder injury. The absence of any Yankee starters did not irk Martinez.

''Look at Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez and the types of seasons that they are having,'' Martinez said of the two Seattle stars. ''I'd say they would trade places with us to be where we are in the standings.''

Wells, who is 10-2 with a 3.92 earned run average, is a cinch to make it, and Irabu, who is 6-3 and leads the league with a 2.47 e.r.a. is a dark horse. O'Neill was the first player Torre mentioned as a Yankee who should be on the team, Brosius has probably been the best ll-around third baseman in the league, and Jeter has been touted as a most-valuable-player candidate. Of the three position players, Jeter is the most likely to be bypassed because Hargrove is sure to select Omar Vizquel, the Cleveland shortstop, as a backup.
