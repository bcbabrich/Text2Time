Ruth Freeman, the university's associate provost, and the head of the program, says that Rochester can afford to give the free tuition because the program costs the university relatively little.

''If all 20 students wanted to take the same course and we had to add a section, it would be a real cost, but this way, you can slip them in and not notice them,'' she said. ''It costs a minimum for faculty and administrative time.''

The program also has its public relations value. A recent questionnaire of incoming freshmen indicated that 80 percent of them knew about the program and more than half said it was a major factor in their choosing Rochester.

Officials at the university said that while there were fifth-year programs at various colleges, they knew of none similar to Take 5 and none that were offered free. University Changing Image

Dennis O'Brien, president of the university, has been working to change the perception of Rochester from a college for students primarily interested in science and engineering to that of a truly liberal arts college. He has declared Wednesdays ''University Day'' and abolished afternoon classes so that students could attend special seminars and lectures on a range of subjects, put on exhibits or simply go out and do their laundry. Judging by students' comments it has been very successful.

''This is a place for the curious and the broad-minded,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ''That's the leading edge of the institution. A university like this produces such fine work in the classroom but students tend to think that that's all there is to it.''

Pauline Jacob, a chemical engineering major, took courses in German and political science. This enabled her to spend last summer in Germany working as a chemical engineer for the Du Pont Company.
