In November 2001, Mr. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer, was appointed by Mr. Ashcroft to be special master of the fund, which Congress created in the days after the terrorist attacks as part of an airline bailout package. Families were asked to waive their right to sue the airlines and other entities. In exchange, they would receive a tax-free $250,000 payment for every death, and more money depending on a family's economic loss from that death, minus the deductions for benefits like life insurance and workers' compensation.

In many ways, Mr. Feinberg was both an odd choice and the natural choice for the job. Odd, because of his political credentials as a former chief of staff for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and as someone who was considered for the position of White House counsel in the Clinton administration. A natural, because of his extensive experience in mediating complicated compensation disputes, including those that arose over the Agent Orange defoliant used in the Vietnam War and the Dalkon Shield birth control device.

One month after his appointment, Mr. Feinberg issued draft regulations outlining the mechanics of the fund, relying chiefly on Deborah E. Greenspan, a partner in his firm, the Feinberg Group; Phil Perry, then acting associate attorney general at the Department of Justice; Jay Lefkowitz, who was general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget; and John Wood, deputy associate attorney general at Justice at the time.

But after families and elected officials criticized the regulations as stingy, Mr. Feinberg and his core advisers made significant changes in the final regulations, which were issued in March 2002, to increase the payments. From that point on, Mr. Feinberg worked tirelessly to persuade families to apply to the fund, convening hundreds of meetings large and small all over the country (and in Britain), from the ballroom of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square to the basement of his Midtown offices.

In the end, he said that although he had expected many people to file at the last minute, he was surprised by the sheer volume of those filings. Equally telling, he said, was the fact that 40 people who had originally filed lawsuits against the airlines decided to file with the fund at the last minute, reducing the number of lawsuits to 39.

That means that of the 2,976 eligible families, at last count only about 50 had failed to file either a lawsuit or a claim.

The statistics, Mr. Feinberg said, give him a ''tremendous sense of personal satisfaction'' in validating the fund as ''a dramatic and stunning success.'' But because of the unique nature and emotional complexity of the Sept. 11 tragedy, he cautioned that the program should not be viewed as a template for future attacks, and certainly not ''as an end run around the tort system.''
