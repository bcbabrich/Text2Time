"Legacy" is Michael Wood's search for the sources of religious thought that have endured into the 20th century. In the six-hour series, which begins tomorrow at 8 P.M. on Channel 13, the English writer and narrator of such upscale productions as "Art of the Western World" and "In Search of the Trojan War" goes to Iraq, India, China, Egypt, Central America and, finally, to what he calls "the barbarian West" to learn how the past has shaped or misshaped the present.

The programs move so fast over such distances of space and time that you may feel left behind. (A map or two might have helped viewers to orient themselves, particularly in the Orient.) But Mr. Wood's breathless enthusiasm and the evocative scenes, notably the festivals in India that continue to draw millions of villagers to Mother Ganges, carry one along.

The first two-hour segment begins in Iraq, by the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, where civilization is said to have begun and out of which came the Biblical accounts of the Flood and the Ark. In the area that entered the Bible as the Garden of Eden, which Mr. Wood visited shortly before the Persian Gulf war, he finds "a blasted landscape"; that not unexpectedly prompts him to reflect on the damage done by the overexploitation of nature's resources.

Although he is critical of many aspects of Western civilization, Mr. Wood shows himself to be a good liberal Englishman at heart. The societies that stir his enthusiasm are those, like ancient Baghdad, where many religions coexisted in a spirit of peaceful pluralism. He is pleased with the thought that Abraham, the humane father of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, may have ruled for a time over a piece of what is now Iraq. In the second hour, on India, he focuses fondly on Hinduism, which has traditionally found room for a variety of beliefs, despite a lamentable propensity of some of the faithful to slaughter Muslims and other non-Hindus from time to time.
