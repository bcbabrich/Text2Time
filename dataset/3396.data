To the Editor:

Re ''War Guilt, and the Difference Between Germany and Japan'' )Op-Ed, Dec. 29):

What the Japanese did to the Chinese during the war wasn't like a paper cut. Their inhuman acts were indeed horrifying, to say to the least.

But the Chinese people are not asking the Japanese to feel guilty for their acts during the war: we are asking them not to distort history.

Feeling guilty isn't a bad thing. It is the first step toward recognizing responsibility, which is much lacking in this world.
