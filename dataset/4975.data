Rene Anselmo, like many residents here, is a man of wealth and taste. He drives a Bentley. He modeled his mansion on the Petit Trianon in Versailles. He has donated money to plant thousands of daffodils and tulips along local roads. He even replaced the chain-link barricade at a nearby elementary school with a rail fence more in keeping with this town's country flavor. ''It looked like a reform school,'' he said. Lately, though, Mr. Anselmo's beautification efforts have turned ugly. This month he was arrested on charges of spray-painting a realtor's For Sale sign in front of a home on North Street, the tree-shaded thoroughfare where he lives. He has admitted to vandalizing eight or nine other signs. And he has threatened further attacks.

''They are trashy, cheap and repulsive,'' said Mr. Anselmo, the 64-year-old owner of a television satellite company. ''First, it was real-estate signs; now it's building contractors, roofers, painters, plumbers. The newest craze is burglar alarms: 'Security by Westec.'

''The signs are advertisements. It's an overcommercialization of the neighborhood.''

In a year when Greenwich is celebrating its 350th anniversary, Mr. Anselmo's arrest has pushed the unlikely issue of sign pollution to the top of the political agenda.

Though many residents are aghast at Mr. Anselmo's tactics, they have applauded his goal of eliminating the signs or making them as esthetically pleasing as possible.
