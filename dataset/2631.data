The country's highest court blocked a centerpiece of President √Ålvaro Uribe's plans to pacify Colombia, an antiterrorist statute that would have given security forces broad powers to tap phones, conduct searches and make arrests in the government's war on Marxist guerrillas. The Constitutional Court struck down the law, approved by Congress last year, because of procedural errors in its lengthy approval process. The bill needed court approval to take effect.
