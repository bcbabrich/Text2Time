An investor group said this week that it might increase its 13.8 percent stake in Koger Equity Inc. to as much as 25 percent, if the company lifted its takeover defenses.

The group, which includes RGI N.V. and Resource Group International Inc., also said it wanted to choose two members for the company's board.

Koger currently has a "poison pill" defense that would make it prohibitively expensive for a hostile bidder to acquire more than 15 percent of its stock.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the RGI group indicated that it might try to oust the Koger board if the Jacksonville, Fla., real estate investment trust denied its requests. Koger officials declined to comment.
