Perhaps familiar surroundings and a towel-waving, frenzied crowd at the Garden will help snap the Knicks out of their funk. But by losing Games 3 and 4, the Knicks have magnified the importance of Game 5. The winner will be one victory away from the finals. The loser will be one loss away from vacation.

"We respect the fact that we have the home court, but we also respect the fact that there are no guarantees," said Pat Riley, after a short practice session yesterday. "Home court will not guarantee anything. Players have to guarantee with a great effort. So that's what we're going to have to have."

More baskets would not hurt the Knicks' cause either. No team, not even the Chicago Bulls, have made the Knicks' offense look as bad in the playoffs as the Pacers made it look in the third and fourth games. The Knicks were pathetic in Game 3 when they scored 68 points, a record low for the National Basketball Association playoffs since the advent of the 24-second clock. They were merely terrible in Game 4 when they produced 77 points in an 83-77 loss. Right Kind of Players

Why has Indiana been able to shut down the Knicks so thoroughly? The Pacers have a superb game plan and the players to execute it. They have have a tall, physical front line that matches up well with New York's frontcourt. Rik Smits has a 4-inch height advantage over Patrick Ewing, enabling him to alter Ewing's shot more often than most centers. Smits's backup, Antonio Davis, has the strength to push Ewing away from his favorite low-post spots.

Dale Davis, Antonio Davis and Smits have kept Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason and Ewing from dominating the glass. And Derrick McKey's defense has helped keep Charles Smith from reaching double figures in any game yet. To win, the Knicks simply must have more scoring from their small forward, whether he be Smith or Mason. And when fast-break opportunities arise, the Knicks must react quickly.
