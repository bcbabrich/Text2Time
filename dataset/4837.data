Q. Our finished basement, which is used as a guest, computer and sewing room, shows no signs of leaks; however, it gets very humid in the summer, so much so that mold grows on the furniture, records and books. This area adjoins an unfinished part of the basement that contains the laundry. We have thought of running a dehumidifier all the time to control the mold, but I think this would be quite expensive. Is there anything else we can do to solve the humidity problem?

A. If the walls are finished or covered with paneling of some type, there may be seepage through the foundation walls that you cannot see. Also, check the outside to make sure that all surface water drains away from the foundation, especially water pouring out of the downspouts during a heavy rain. Finally, if the laundry area has a clothes dryer, make sure it is vented directly to the outside. Otherwise, this could be the source of the humidity.

Q. I own a condominium in a high-rise building. Whenever I take a shower, the walls and ceiling of the bathroom are covered with moisture. I tried sizing the walls and running a fan, but this has not helped. Someone suggested I install a ceiling exhaust fan. Would this help?

A. You need some type of fan that exhausts directly to the outside, either through the ceiling or the wall, unless your building already has an exhaust system for the bathrooms. Even with an exhaust fan or built-in exahust vents, condensation on walls and ceilings is almost inevitable when taking a hot shower with the bathroom door closed.
