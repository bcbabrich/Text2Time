The federal bankruptcy judge assigned to the Chrysler case is used to dealing with complicated high-profile cases in which every decision is dissected by legal analysts and the news media. In fact, he has done two at once.

The judge, Arthur J. Gonzalez, oversaw the reorganization of Enron in 2001, which set a record by filing for bankruptcy with $63 billion in assets, and WorldCom in 2002, which topped Enron with $107 billion assets when it filed, The New York Times’s Duff Wilson reports.

Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York on Thursday, and first court hearing on the case was scheduled for Friday.

Like the Chrysler case, the Enron and WorldCom cases were drawn by Judge Gonzalez in a sealed envelope system colloquially known as “the wheel.” The system is meant to assure that cases are assigned randomly to judges in the Manhattan court.

On Thursday, lawyers on both sides of the Enron case said Judge Gonzalez was prepared to take up Chrysler’s Chapter 11 filing.

“I think it’s a good thing for everyone involved — the creditors, the company,” Luc A. Despins, who represented Enron’s creditors, told The Times. “He’s just a very efficient and very organized judge. He’s used to dealing with huge cases with huge dockets.”

Martin J. Bienenstock, who represented Enron, told The Times: “He was experienced, wise, patient and fair. He was a straight arrow. It’s good for everybody.”

Judge Gonzalez, 62, was born in Brooklyn and educated in the Bronx, where he received an accounting degree at Fordham in 1969. He worked as a science teacher in New York public schools for 13 years.

While teaching he met his wife, Marie, who is now an assistant principal, according to a former colleague, Martin Pollner. Mr. Gonzalez took evening classes at Fordham Law School and received his law degree in 1982 and an advanced degree in taxation from New York University in 1990. (The couple’s daughter, Mia, also recently graduated from Fordham law, Mr. Pollner said.)

Mr. Gonzalez worked for the Internal Revenue Service and in private practice in New York before Harold D. Jones, then the United States bankruptcy trustee for New York, Connecticut and Vermont, recruited him to be his first assistant trustee.

“He is extremely bright,” Mr. Jones told The Times Thursday. “He is very calm even when there can be heated discussion.”

Mr. Gonzalez showed he was not intimidated by the job in 1994 when he imposed a penalty of about $1 million on the bankruptcy heavyweight firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges for not reporting conflicts in a case.

“That took guts for a new judge,” Mr. Pollner told The Times.

He is also an avid runner with a time of 4:30:09 in last year’s New York Marathon. But Chrysler wants a fast bankruptcy reorganization, and Mr. Gonzalez has shown he can sprint as well.

“He is a very fast decision maker,” Harvey R. Miller, who heads Weil, Gotshal’s bankruptcy practice, told The Times.
