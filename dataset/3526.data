Overview of Lesson Plan: Students will first explore the power of the visual image to convey a message by examining the portrait of George Washington on American dollar bills. They next use today’s featured article, ‘Prolific Chinese Painter Is Anonymous No More,’ to learn about a famous portrait of Mao, and what the artwork reveal about the People’s Republic of China. In small groups, students next will examine images of important personages in various cultures throughout the world and, finally, create their own portraits that convey messages they wish others to understand about themselves.

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Examine the message conveyed by George Washington’s portrait on American dollar bills.

2. Learn about a similarly famous portrait of a past leader in China, and consider the message it is meant to communicate by reading and discussing “Prolific Chinese Painter Is Anonymous No More.”

3. Explore the messages that artworks of important people convey in various cultures throughout the world.

4. Create their own portraits to communicate something important about themselves to others.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-copies of “Prolific Chinese Painter is Anonymous No More” (one for each student)

-assortment of global art history books (see step 3)

-sketch paper

-large sheets of drawing paper (one for each student)

-drawing materials (markers, crayons, pastels, etc.)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/HOMEWORK: Have students look at the portrait on American dollar bills, posing the following questions: “Who is this person? What do you think the artist wanted us to believe about George Washington? (Look at his expression? Is he someone you might trust or feel confident in? Does he look like he might easily become unnerved?) What is the significance of having this image on a dollar bill?”

2. Now explain that the class will read the article, “Prolific Chinese Painter Is Anonymous No More,” to learn about a famous portrait of Mao, the founder of the People’s Republic of China, which turns 50 on October 1, 1999. Discuss the following questions together:

a. Why is the location of Mao’s portrait significant?

b. What does the writer mean when he writes, “The portrait has seemed to preside over the nation unchanged, sturdy as a piece of Communist architecture, no matter how drastically China itself was being transformed”?

c. Why didn’t people in China originally know who painted Mao’s portrait?

d. Why does Wang Qizhi keep painting the same portrait?

e. How does Mr. Wang feel about having remained anonymous for so many years?

f. How does the artwork offer “a thread of continuity” throughout the tumultuous half-century of communist rule?

g. Why do some Chinese people perceive Mao’s portrait favorably?

h. Why do others dislike Mao? What were some of the negative aspects of his leadership?

i. How does Mr. Wang’s son feel about Mao? Why did Mao target the arts in the 1960s?

j. Did Mr. Wang entirely create every version of his famous Mao portrait?

k. What political message did the Central Committee of the Communist Party feel was inappropriate in the original version of the painting?

l. Why might Mao’s portrait offer some comfort during the China’s current changes?

3. Divide the class into small groups, each one focusing on the way a particular culture portrays important people. You might have students examine paintings and sculptures of:

. Egyptian pharaohs

. Roman politicians and intellectuals

. 17-19th century British aristocracy

. French emperors and kings

. American presidents and social figures (e.g., Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie)

. African royalty

. Mayan religious leaders

. 17th century Dutch burghers

Looking at their assigned image, students in each group should together discuss and then individually answer the following questions in their journals:

. How did the artist convey the person’s importance? Consider size, media, stance, facial expression, accompanying objects, setting, and so forth.

. What might ordinary people have felt gazing upon this artwork?

. How might the artist have felt creating such a work?

. How would you have felt creating this artwork?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Explain to students that they are going to create a portrait of themselves. As you distribute art supplies to students, have them list characteristics they would like visually to convey to others about themselves. Then have them begin sketches and finally their portraits, which they can complete at home or in a subsequent class. Create an “Impressive Portraits” exhibition and have the class discuss what each student artist seems to have wanted to communicate to others.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Is all art meant to persuade or convey a message?

–Is art that is created for political purposes different from art that is created for the sole pleasure of viewing? If so, how and, if not, why not?

–Would you have wanted to remain anonymous if you had painted Mao’s famous portrait? Why do you think Wang Qizhi accepted this condition for so long?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on their written journal entries, participation in class and small group discussions, and thoughtful and imaginative participation in small group research and discussion, as well as their ability to express something about themselves in a visual manner.

Vocabulary:

Beijing, Communist, Tiananmen Square, officialdom, prominent, industrious, suppressing, acquaintances, burdensome, appreciation, retiree, displaced, wake, collective, fervor, idealism, avocation, scaffolding, intolerant

Extension Activities:

1. Compare examples of traditional Chinese court portraiture to the portrait of Mao. What are the differences visually as well as in their messages?

2. Research portraiture throughout American history. How has the style, who is portrayed, and the messages conveyed changed over time? How do these expressions compare to Wang Qizhi’s painting of Mao?

3. Write a diary entry as Wang Qizhi for the day he completed the first Mao portrait, and one for October 1, 1999, the fifty year anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. How might his feelings about his work and China have changed, or not, over time?

4. Role-play a discussion about the criteria for significant art between Wang Oizhi and a western art historian who considers originality and uniqueness of great importance.

5. Investigate Robert Wilson’s monumental performance piece “Nixon in China” (through videotape or audio recording). What does this art form convey about former President Nixon’s landmark 1972 visit to China? What “message” might Wilson have tried to make in this piece?

6. Write letters between Mr. Wang and his son regarding their views on Mao and the importance of Chinese traditional art.

7. Find examples in various cultures of other art forms meant to glorify important people-including architecture, music, dance, songs, theater, and so forth.

8. Research the official portraits of each president of the United States. Compare them in terms of demeanor, style, and the message they communicate about each president. Also investigate the process of selecting the artist and how he or she undertakes this commission. If you were selected today, how would you portray the current president?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Foreign Language- For those languages that you are studying in class, or are represented by the students’ heritage, research the way artists depict important people. How might the art represent the values of these cultures?

Global History- Examine the New York Times special online resource “Issue in Depth: Communist China at 50″ (//www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/index-china.html). Looking at the time line (//www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/china-index-timeline.html), describe the evolution of Mao’s influence over the last 50 years.

-What was Mao’s Cultural Revolution of 1965? Why was it called a “cultural” revolution? Did the dramatic changes come from within the artistic community or from without? How does this compare to other revolutions throughout the world in history? Why might Mao have focused so much attention on culture? What power do you think he perceived culture to potentially have on people?

Journalism- Explore photojournalism. How do journalists use pictures to relate a story and get a message across? How do photojournalist articles differ from those that only are text based?

Science- Interview a museum conservator about the potential damage to art, especially pieces exhibited outside-from sun, smog, and humidity and other factors. What ideas might they offer to avoid having to continually repaint Mao’s portrait?

Using the Times- Read and evaluate art reviews about Chinese contemporary and traditional art. How do the artworks in these exhibits reflect the values of the artists and of Chinese society at the time in which they were created?
