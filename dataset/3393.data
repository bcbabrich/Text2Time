To the Editor:

A Nov. 30 editorial argues against intervention by Florida's Legislature, but it may be appropriate, legally and politically, for it to resolve the selection of electors. We must remember that the margin of error in counting votes is greater than the margin of victory. Also, it is likely that the courts will not finish their work by Dec. 12, when electors must be chosen.

The Legislature could act in a truly courageous fashion and appoint 12 electors favoring George W. Bush, 12 favoring Al Gore and 1 favoring Ralph Nader. It would have a Solomonic result that fairly represented the results in Florida and the country. It would also show the quick way to Electoral College reform.
