Early in “Being Flynn,” the new movie directed by Paul Weitz, Jonathan Flynn slides behind the wheel of a yellow cab as his voice, on the soundtrack, gives vent to a barrage of misanthropy. It is hard for a movie lover not to detect a wink in this otherwise perfectly ordinary scene, since Jonathan is played by Robert De Niro, the most famous taxi driver in movies. “Being Flynn” is a much milder movie than “Taxi Driver,” pursuing intimate themes rather than big ideas, but Jonathan Flynn and Travis Bickle are linked by the discrepancy between self-image and reality and also by Mr. De Niro’s gift for portraying alienated men at odds with themselves.

He has not done much of that lately. Moviegoers too young for “Taxi Driver” or “Raging Bull” know him as the comically menacing patriarch of the “Meet the Parents” movies, the last of which was directed by Mr. Weitz. And while his performance as Jonathan Flynn strays now and then into histrionics (not without reason), it also provides a reminder of what a resourceful, unpredictable and subtle actor Mr. De Niro can be.

Jonathan runs on vodka, orange juice, bile and delusions of grandeur. He is a writer, and in his own estimation one of only three in American letters worth bothering with, the other two being Mark Twain and J. D. Salinger. His own shaggy, rambling manner, and his shabby circumstances, suggest Charles Bukowski, but with more blarney and less compassion. “We are put on this earth to help other people” is his motto, but in practice it seems to mean that everyone else on earth should either see to his needs or leave him alone.

Jonathan is not the only Flynn, or the only writer, in “Being Flynn.” The movie is equally the story of his son, Nick, who grew up with his mother (Julianne Moore) and the legend of his absent dad. Jonathan served time in federal prison for passing bad checks, writing letters to Nick that fed the boy’s literary ambition but even after release never showing up in person. In his 20s Nick, played by Paul Dano, starts working at a homeless shelter where Jonathan, after losing his apartment and his job, happens to take up residence. The two of them establish a difficult, painful and ambiguous connection. The real Nick Flynn wrote about this in a memoir with a title too pungent and profane for me to repeat here. Mr. Weitz, whose adaptation has been approved by Mr. Flynn, has softened and streamlined the story, but his desire to retain some of the book’s candor and poetry is evident. Sometimes awkwardly and sometimes gracefully, “Being Flynn” charts a middle course between the rough honesty of its source and the sentimental triteness of the much worse movie it could have been.

The melodrama of parent-child reconciliation, of redemption and recovery and hard lessons tenderly learned is a staple of movies and television, and the magnetic pull of that therapeutic genre is hard to resist. It is to Mr. Weitz’s credit that he tries. He does not force Jonathan and Nick into teary embraces or ringing speeches but rather lets Mr. Dano and Mr. De Niro find their own rhythms, which don’t always harmonize. Mr. Dano is a quiet, inscrutable presence, but has an odd charisma, a blend of sensitivity and bottled-up rage, that makes him an intriguing foil for Mr. De Niro, as he was for Daniel Day-Lewis in “There Will be Blood.”

The drama in “Being Flynn” arises partly from the battle between the two Flynns about whose story it is. Jonathan certainly knows how to call attention to himself. Nick is more diffident and watchful, and it is easier to sympathize with someone tormented by the death of his mother and the toxic legacy of his father’s neglect. He has his own self-destructive patterns of behavior, but these are examined more superficially than his father’s, which is too bad.
