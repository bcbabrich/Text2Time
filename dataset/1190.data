Seventeen was once the magazine girls picked up before they turned 13 and cast aside well before they headed to senior prom.

But Seventeen’s popularity has been growing with college students, and now the magazine is introducing along with its August issue a 40-page supplement called Seventeen College Style. Due out Tuesday, the issue includes articles on campus fashions, creative ways to apply eye makeup for rush week events and affordable ways to decorate a dorm room and make it the “hangout, study haven, makeout spot of your dreams,” according to the magazine.

In developing material, Seventeen worked with several Web sites, including hercampus.com, aimed at women in college, and relied on a survey of 1,000 female college students. It also tried to tailor its articles to women on a variety of campuses.

“We are the magazine that helps them go to college,” said Ann Shoket, Seventeen’s editor in chief. “We designed the stories so that it was drilled down to what kind of college you are going to.”

Seventeen views the supplement as a safe investment, citing data from the media research firm GfK MRI showing that the number of 18- to 24-year-old women reading the magazine jumped by 17 percent in the last five years.

Ms. Shoket credits the growth partly to the events it has been holding on college campuses, where copies of the magazine and samples from advertisers are distributed to students. For the last five years, Seventeen has also run a “Freshman 15” program in which 15 women write blogs about their first year.

Danai Kadzere, a 19-year-old Harvard student entering her junior year, who appears in the latest issue, said that after taking a break from reading Seventeen for a couple of years, she returned to it because she wanted to see clothes she could actually buy.

“Vogue, I cannot afford a single thing in there. But in Seventeen I can afford most of all of it,” said Ms. Kadzere. “In college, your parents aren’t paying for your clothes anymore. Even with a summer job, it still doesn’t come up to being able to afford a $100 T-shirt.”
