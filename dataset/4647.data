Television, for all its awesome reach, has an ephemeral touch. Even the best programs rarely leave footprints in libraries, archives, indexes or books. It is harder to retrieve the transcript of a documentary seen by millions than to unearth an obscure magazine article read by thousands.

Who remembers, for example, an ambitious four-part CBS documentary called "The Warren Report," broadcast just 25 years ago? It was apparently overlooked by the American Medical Association, which claimed in May that two pathologists, Dr. James J. Humes and Dr. J. Thornton Boswell, had broken a 28-year silence to discuss their autopsy on President Kennedy.

In truth, Dr. Humes had offered essentially the same defense of the Warren Commission's forensic findings when he was interviewed by CBS 25 years ago. I only learned of this during a chance encounter with Leslie Midgley, the program's executive producer, who has been following with bemused detachment the uproar over Oliver Stone's recent film, "J.F.K."

The documentary yields other surprises. Take the famous photograph of a grinning Lee Harvey Oswald holding his rifle. The picture's authenticity has been widely questioned, most recently in "J.F.K." The shadows cast by his face and body don't match, prompting charges that Oswald's head was superimposed on someone else's body.
