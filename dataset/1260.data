Matchup to Watch

Jets’ Offense

vs. Arizona’s Defense

For all their flaws — and they have many — the Cardinals have one clear strength: a stout defense, led by linebacker Daryl Washington (nine sacks) and defensive end Calais Campbell, that has forced 23 turnovers, sixth best in the N.F.L. That is not a good matchup for the Jets, who are prone to turnovers and are 0-4 this season against top-10 defenses. Arizona ranks seventh.

NUMBER TO WATCH

7

The loss total for each team. But the Cardinals’ losses have come consecutively dating to Oct. 4. Arizona’s average margin of defeat is 11 points — nearly 8 fewer points than the Jets’. This is the first game in what seemed a favorable season-ending stretch for the Jets, but none of their opponents seem inferior any longer.
