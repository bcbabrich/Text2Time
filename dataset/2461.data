To the Editor:

As is generally witnessed when disaster strikes, our nation pulls together, at least for a short period of time.

In the face of the indescribable devastation and horror wrought by Hurricane Katrina, we see Louisiana's United States senators, one Democrat, one Republican, standing side by side in unity.

We find the mayor of New Orleans and the governor of the state, both Democrats, in sync and harmony with the Republican administration of our country, as extraordinary relief is requested and granted. All come together to aid those in desperate need of rescue, food and shelter.

How long will the harmony last? If the Sept. 11 attacks are a legitimate barometer, it would appear that the sense of community will dissolve as soon as the crisis fades.
