"Riverdale is a hotbed because it has an affluent, intellectual and verbal community and several platforms for debate including two community newspapers that compete and keep the dialogue going," said Charles G. Moerdler, chairman of the community board's land use committee. Among the more controversial developments are the projects being put up by Shmuel Jonas and Joseph Korff.

When it became clear last fall that a new zoning regulation was about to pass that would limit new construction to eight stories in parts of central Riverdale, both developers raced the clock to get their foundations in the ground under the old rules.

David Mandl, the architect of the Jonas project called Arlington Suites, a 13-story building going up on an irregular parcel between Arlington and Netherland Avenues, recalled how the developer managed to get the building going before the new rules took effect. "We compressed six months of work into 45 days, digging out bedrock, excavating and pouring 18,399 square feet of foundation," he said. "On Sept. 27 I went to the Buildings Department myself and got the last permit at 3:45 p.m. They shut the permit window at 4 p.m. The next morning the City Planning Commission voted to change the zoning, restricting heights to 70 feet."

Though he encountered several challenges to the project's eligibility for coverage under the old code, which requires that the foundation be virtually complete, he did get a stamp of approval from the Board of Standards and Appeals.

"It is all over," Mr. Mandl said triumphantly. "This is the last tall building in Riverdale."

Well, not quite. Mr. Korff's condominium project on a mostly vacant parcel at 237th Street and the Henry Hudson Parkway will rise to 19 stories. The new regulations limit building heights in a 30-block area of central Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil. They also confine new construction in north Riverdale to single-family and semidetached dwellings.

Developers working in other parts of Riverdale will not have those restrictions -- at least not for now. But rezoning is being considered for other areas.

Some of the new projects sit on land occupied until recently by small homes, inciting arguments about scale, context and scarcity of parking. Others are going up on vacant lots, raising environmental hackles. In fact, regulations governing the Special Natural Area District, which was created in 1975 to protect the topography and plant and marine life, were tightened in February..
