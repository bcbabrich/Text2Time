To the Editor:

An April 24 news article notes that growth in income inequality over the last several decades was particularly pronounced in New York State.

The 1990's were a boom time for the state on average, but the prosperity was not broadly shared, and New York's income gaps continued to grow.

These findings should serve as a wake-up call for New York policy makers. Religious, labor, civic, government and business leaders should convene a series of summit meetings to address both the causes and the consequences of this situation and to develop a strategic plan for reducing child poverty, increasing job opportunities and ensuring that the incomes of working families do not continue to deteriorate.
