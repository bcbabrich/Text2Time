The committee's statement covers a wide range of problem areas in undergraduate education, from fiscal planning to decision‐making procedures to the role of students in shaping policy.

But the tuition proposal seemed certain to attract the most attention and argument. As the report put it:

“The committee is fully aware of the controversial nature, particularly within the academic community, of any recommendation to raise the tuitions of public institutions to approximately 50 per cent of instructional costs.”

The committee's main arguments for financing shifts are social. The present low‐tuition structure at public institutions, it maintains, amounts to governmental subsidy of middleincome and wealthy students who should be required to pay more, and thus a diversion of funds from those who are poorest.

The report acknowledges the benefits to society of higher education and says they justify some subsidy for most students. But it adds:

“Nevertheless, because of the benefits of education to the individual, we consider it appropriate for students and their families to pay as large a part of the cost as they can afford.”

The report was presented at a news conference in Washington's Sheraton‐Carlton Hotel by W. D. Eberle, President Nixon's I special representative for trade negotiations and chairman of the Committee for Economic Development subcommittee that conducted the college study; Alfred C. Neal, president of the committee, and Sterling M. McMurrin, dean of the graduate school of the University of Utah and the study's project director.

The three stressed that the increases in tuition recommended in the report should not go into effect until adequate grant and loan systems were in operation.

Mr. McMurrin, a former United States Commissioner of Education, disagreed with the tuition‐increase part of the report because of its heavy reliance on loans for students not poor enough to qualify for outright grants.
