Several issues have not been raised in news articles on public financing of private or religious schools (''Ohio Paying Some Tuition for Religious School Students'' and ''Saying No to Private Schools at Public Expense,'' Education page, Aug. 28).

Public financing is intended to educate the children of the public-at-large, not merely those successful enough to gain entrance and remain.

Private and religious schools pick and choose among students. Every year, we in the public school system deal with dozens of former religious and private school students seeking placement; the reasons they and their parents give are illustrative. ''I couldn't pay the tuition any more'' or ''they told my son he had to pass all his courses or they'd put him out'' or ''he kept getting into trouble.''

It takes savvy parents to get their students into private or religious schools, voucher or no voucher. And students of such parents typically do well regardless of where they go to school. Is it any wonder that such children do better than those students simply sent off, alone, to wander into their neighborhood schools?
