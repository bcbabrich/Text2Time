The two Germanys have signed their treaty of unification, the last major act of the German Democratic Republic before it disappears into a single Germany on Oct. 3. The question of its role in Europe, indeed the role of nation-states in Europe, becomes increasingly urgent as the countries to the East move on from the euphoria of freedom to the agony of transformation.

Preoccupation with the Persian Gulf crisis has diverted attention from the critically decisive period ahead in Europe. It adds difficulties because it has always been harder for the Common Market to move in periods of economic dislocation such as the new oil shock will bring.

The whole timetable of Europe's evolution has changed. There will be a new all-German government based on elections Dec. 2, even before the European Community (absorbing East Germany) begins its major meetings on monetary and political union later that month in Rome. Their results will determine whether there is a European Germany or a German Europe, as the Federal Republic's Hans-Dietrich Genscher puts it.

There are hints that Bonn's pledge for a strong new push to integration is eroding with the temptation of a special role in the East. There have been suspicions this would happen. But so far Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and Mr. Genscher as well, have insisted they are resolved to anchor the new Germany in a union with increasingly limited national sovereignties.
