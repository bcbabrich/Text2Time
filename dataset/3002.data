To the Editor:

Re ''Play Nicely, Everyone. In Nassau, It's the Law'' (news article, Sept. 25):

It is a shame that we have to institute laws to uphold sportsmanship and set up legislation to control what parents and coaches should be able to handle in their own backyard.

As someone who has been an athletic director for several sports, I can honestly tell you that the worst part of the position is dealing with some parents. Their attitude is terrible, and they treat even their grammar-school-age children as if they are playing for the major leagues. Your article is right on target as far as parental behavior goes, because I have seen it.

Perhaps the parents should remember that they are not supposed to be living vicariously through their children.
