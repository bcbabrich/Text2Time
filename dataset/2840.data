A former state agriculture commissioner, Meg Scott Phipps, was found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said Ms. Phipps conspired to cover up illegal campaign donations from vendors who wanted to work at the state fair. Her lawyers argued that her aides had kept her in the dark about the payments. Ms. Phipps, the daughter and granddaughter of North Carolina governors, could be sentenced to more than four years in prison. She also faces federal charges. Ariel Hart (NYT)
