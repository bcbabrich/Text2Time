Ambitious restaurants often present new spins on old practices, but one of the ways Del Posto dares to be different struck me as odd.

It wasn’t worth mentioning in the limited space of a formal review, and it isn’t something that detracts from the pleasurable experience of the restaurant. I nonetheless remain transfixed and perplexed by it.

When I and other guests left Del Posto, the little parting gift we received wasn’t a box of bon bons, which is what diners at Telepan get, or a coffee cake of sorts, which is what the Modern and other restaurants hand out.

It was . . . a bag of breadcrumbs. Yes, breadcrumbs. Not be eaten later in the evening or the next morning, but to be used, presumably, in some future cooking endeavor.

The purpose of this unusual bequest may have to do with what accompanies it: a sheet of text about the various uses of breadcrumbs from a book by the superchef Mario Batali, a television personality and one of the owners of Del Posto. With that text and that reference, the restaurant hammers home the point that it is offering diners more than just a terrific meal. It is offering them a brush with culinary celebrity.

Annotated breadcrumbs are just a part of that experience. On many nights, Mr. Batali, in chef’s whites and orange clogs, personally delivers canapés to tables. Lidia Bastianich, also one of the restaurant’s owners, also the host of her own television show, stands in the dining room whisking zabaglione. It could be argued that she’d do more good in the kitchen, but the kitchen is out of view. Diners wouldn’t be able to see her there.

This sort of exhibitionism isn’t unique to Del Posto, not by a long shot. The open kitchen at Bar Americain affords diners a clear glimpse of the chef (and television personality) Bobby Flay. When I dined there, he was usually standing at the edge of that kitchen, as close to the dining room — and as noticeable — as possible.

If Jean-Georges Vongerichten is at his restaurants Perry St. or Jean Georges on a given night, diners will know it, because he won’t stick to the stoves for the duration. He’ll take a promenade or two or three. He’d be silly — and it would be commercially self-defeating — not to.

Even less vaunted establishments traffic in whatever gastronomic name recognition they can. At Pylos in the East Village, where Diane Kochilas, a widely recognized authority on Greek cuisine, serves as the consulting chef, her cookbooks are on display just inside the entrance.

In restaurants as in movies, star power draws an audience. Follow the trail of breadcrumbs to a savvy marketing strategy: if you’ve got a big name behind the scenes, haul him or her onto center stage.
