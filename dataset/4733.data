By the time Mr. Hallstrom, Ms. Robinson and Mr. Dunne finally managed to get together -- not in Stockholm, not in New York, but in Los Angeles -- Mr. Hallstrom said he had read the script by Malia Scotch Marmo, a native of East Boston who was brought up in Wakefield, Mass., by Italian-American parents. "I really liked it," he said. "It was one of the few scripts I could imagine myself directing. It was sort of European-style, it had low-key comedy touches to it and the dialogue was very real and funny. You could tell it was a personal story, and I really liked the blend of comedy and drama."

But there was a hitch.

Mr. Hallstrom was committed to making a film of "Peter Pan." He spent a year in preproduction work, but the film was never made. In the summer of 1988, he said, he worked with Ms. Scotch Marmo on polishing the script in the expectation of starting to shoot "Once Around" in the beginning of 1989. But the cast, which finally came to include Danny Aiello, Gena Rowlands and Laura San Giacomo, as well as Mr. Dreyfuss and Ms. Hunter, could not be completed.

Mr. Hallstrom then worked on "Mermaids" for a while.

Finally, last January, filming of "Once Around" started in Boston and continued in St. Martin and in Wilmington, N.C., where interiors were shot.

"It was a wonderful experience," Mr. Hallstrom said. Now he is in Stockholm, taking a break from reading scripts and "sort of fiddling with a script of my own." Honor for De Niro
