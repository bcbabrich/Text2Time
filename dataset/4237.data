To the Editor:

The writer of your article on New York City's West 57th Street ("A T-Shirt for Every Theme," Nov. 24) seems to have walked up and down the street with blinders on until the lights became garish enough to see. Too late.

He writes that West 57th Street was "pale" in comparison to Fifth and Park avenues, Broadway and the Bowery. Fifty-seventh Street has always been one of the cultural centers of Manhattan: a magnificent street of width, beauty and elegance.

Regrettably, only Hollywood's and New York City's current catering to tinsel taste awoke him. But this new streetscape is a sad testament to the city's continuing slide into a theme park mentality (42d Street being another case in point).

Long before the likes of Planet Hollywood and the Brooklyn Diner were dropped on 57th Street, that thoroughfare was home to a marvelous juxtaposition of eclectic architecture and companionable commerce: most of the finest art galleries in the city; the Art Students League (housed in a beautiful building); the wonderful old Automat; the Russian Tea Room in all its glory, and the jewel in the crown, Carnegie Hall. It was a street in the true understated European tradition. All this in the short space from Avenue of the Americas to Broadway alone.
