On Saturday afternoon, Clark Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs’ owner, released the kind of statement that he probably never imagined he would have to make.

One of his players, linebacker Jovan Belcher, killed himself in front of team personnel after killing his girlfriend, the police said.

Hunt wrote:

“The entire Chiefs family is deeply saddened by today’s events, and our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy, thoughts and prayers for the families and friends affected by this unthinkable tragedy. We sincerely appreciate the expressions of sympathy and support we have received from so many in the Kansas City and NFL communities, and ask for continued prayers for the loved ones of those impacted. We will continue to fully cooperate with the authorities and work to ensure that the appropriate counseling resources are available to all members of the organization.”

The Chiefs host the Carolina Panthers on Sunday afternoon, and there has been no word that the game will be postponed.

From the Times article by Judy Battista and Marc Santora:

On Facebook, a group calling itself Save Our Chiefs released a statement that said: “We feel that tomorrow’s game is neither the proper place nor the proper time to continue these activities, but rather tomorrow’s game should be a time for all fans to come together and help this team recover from a great tragedy. “While we are mired in a bad season with bad play and bad management, there are 52 guys on the field that just lost a friend. There are things WAY more important than football. Hug your loved ones and appreciate every breath you take. Life is too precious and way too short.”

The Chiefs have announced that the game will be played. The Chiefs fan group is not advocating that the game be canceled; it is calling for a temporary halt to its protests against team management.

But the question remains: Should the game go on?
