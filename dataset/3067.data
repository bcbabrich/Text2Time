A juvenile court judge ordered today that Michael C. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, be tried as an adult in the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley, setting the stage for a dramatic jury trial more than a quarter-century after Miss Moxley was found bludgeoned to death outside her family's home in Greenwich, Conn.

Mr. Skakel, who is now 40, was charged as a juvenile because he was 15 at the time of Miss Moxley's death. If he is convicted as an adult, he could face a sentence of life in prison. Conviction by a juvenile court judge would have meant little or no jail time, and state prosecutors had suggested they might have dropped the case if Mr. Skakel were not tried as an adult in Superior Court. If Mr. Skakel is convicted, the trial judge in the adult court will have to decide how to sentence him.

In a decision filled mostly with footnotes and quotations from statutes, the judge, Maureen Dennis, ruled today that Connecticut's juvenile justice system was not equipped to punish a 40-year-old defendant and ordered the case transferred to Superior Court. She did not rule on a motion by Mr. Skakel's lawyer to dismiss the case.

''From the evidence presented, this court finds that there is no available or suitable state institution designed for the care and treatment of children to which the Juvenile Court could commit the now-40-year-old respondent that would be suitable for his care and treatment, should he be adjudicated delinquent for the murder of Martha Moxley,'' Judge Dennis wrote.
