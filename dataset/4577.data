For the Rangers, it must have seemed like the end of a long climb. Late Thursday night, with four road games behind them and one to go, they had reached a kind of summit to their season, and so they paused to acknowledge it.

Their 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings gave the Rangers their 33d victory and 67th and 68th points of the season, nudging them ahead of the Montreal Canadiens for first place over all in the National Hockey League. It was a moment that they wore well.

"We take a lot of pride in this," goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck said. "That's why we lace 'em up. We're the top team in the league, but this is still no time to pat ourselves on the back. We have a tough game Saturday in Minnesota; it doesn't get any easier." End of Trip in Sight

In nine nights on the road, the Rangers have three victories and one tie after stops at Calgary, Edmonton, San Jose and here. The trip ends Saturday night against the North Stars, but now the Rangers are assured of returning home with a lead in the Patrick Division and with no worse than a tie for the most victories in the league.
