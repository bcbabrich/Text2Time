A FISH IN THE WATER: A Memoir By Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Helen Lane. Penguin, $14.95. The author is best known as a novelist, but he had a brief career as a politician. He explores both roles in this memoir, which describes his formative years as well as his 1990 run for President of Peru. The campaign was a debacle, but many predicted Mr. Vargas Llosa would use the experience to write "a good book," Alan Riding said here last year. "And he has." HEADING WEST By Doris Betts. Scribner Paperback, $12. Nancy Finch, an unmarried librarian, is the kind of woman nothing happens to. That is, until her vacation in North Carolina is interrupted by an armed man, who kidnaps her and proceeds to drive toward the Grand Canyon. Issues of responsibility and accountability arise as Nancy realizes she has become a silent partner in her own abduction. Just restored to print, this 1982 novel offers pleasures "infinitely more subtle, complex and memorable than being scared in your armchair," Beth Gutcheon wrote in these pages when it was published. She added, " 'Heading West' is a book of great delights." Ms. Betts's collection THE ASTRONOMER AND OTHER STORIES (Louisiana State University, $11.95) is also in print again. Many kinds of innocence are lost in these pieces, including, in the title novella, that of a retired man who has assumed he is beyond fantasy and desire. In 1966 our reviewer, Benedict Kiely, said the author "displays equally a rich imagination and disturbing vision." A NEW WORLD: An Epic of Colonial America From the Founding of Jamestown to the Fall of Quebec By Arthur Quinn. Berkley, $15. A historian details the many ways in which early America's idealism was either squelched or nonexistent. (John Smith's character, he notes, was not exactly as it is portrayed in Disney's "Pocahontas.") "His book is a scrumptious reminder of the pleasures of historical writing that rises to the level of literature," George F. Will wrote in the Book Review last year. ARABIAN NIGHTS & DAYS By Naguib Mahfouz. Translated by Denys Johnson-Davies. Anchor/Doubleday, $12. Many folk and fairy tales have a dark side, and this Egyptian Nobel laureate finds one throughout "The Arabian Nights." (Scheherazade's marriage to a lecherous murderer was hardly a happy ending.) His retelling can be read as a "daring and biting critique of the corruption of power in the modern Middle East," one critic said earlier this year. The same publisher has reissued Mr. Mahfouz's novel THE HARAFISH, translated by Catherine Cobham ($11), which depicts the fate of numerous generations of a family whose roots are in what Americans might call the underclass (and Arabs call the harafish). In 1994 one reviewer described it as "a whirling dervish of a good yarn." More Arabian tales can be found in DAMASCUS NIGHTS, by Rafik Schami, translated by Philip Boehm (Scribner Paperback, $11). In 1959 a great Syrian storyteller, struck mute by witchcraft, can regain his voice only if he is given seven unique gifts -- which turn out to be stories. The author "writes with wisdom, wit and lightheartedness," Malcolm Bradbury said here in 1993. TRUE NORTH: A Memoir By Jill Ker Conway. Vintage, $12. The author, who wrote of her childhood in the Australian outback in "The Road From Coorain," turns here to her adult challenges in a different wilderness: academia. She "has come a long way from the parched fields" she grew up in, Carol Brightman wrote in these pages last year. A woman's journeys are also the basis of AN UNSPOKEN HUNGER: Stories From the Field, by Terry Tempest Williams (Vintage, $10). This Utah-based writer and naturalist explores her own connections to the earth and those of women like Georgia O'Keeffe and Rachel Carson. In 1994 our reviewer, John Hanson Mitchell, praised the book's "dark strength and power." ONE TRUE THING By Anna Quindlen. Dell, $6.99. The narrator, a young journalist named Ellen Gulden, has to confront both the loss of her mother and the accusation that she ended her ill parent's suffering. As the novel depicts Kate Gulden's final days, "the reader cannot help caring about her, and mourning her death," Frederick Busch said in the Book Review last year. HENRY ADAMS By Ernest Samuels. Belknap/Harvard University, $16.95. This book, a revision and abridgment of the author's 1964 Pulitzer Prize-winning three-volume work, shows its subject to be more appealing as a historian and writer than as a human being. "It is a complete success" and "a remarkable feat of the biographer's art," Hugh Brogan wrote in these pages in 1989. OUT OF SILENCE: An Autistic Boy's Journey Into Language and Communication By Russell Martin. Penguin, $11.95. Speaking is so natural to most people that it is rarely remembered that every conversation is the result of a complex neurological process. The author writes of just how difficult it was for language to take hold in his autistic nephew's seething brain. The result is "deeply moving," F. Gonzalez-Crussi said here last year. THE TRIBE OF TIGER: Cats and Their Culture By Elizabeth Marshall Thomas. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12. Felines, by no means all aloof or solitary, are revealed in their complexity by the author of "The Hidden Life of Dogs." Whether writing of the cougar or the house kitty, "Ms. Thomas has an astute sense of the meaning of every meow," our reviewer, David Quammen, said in 1994. LAUREL GRAEBER
