It’s come to our attention that some readers, new to all the mania that is global soccer culture, would like a little more annotation geared toward beginners, to supplement what one of them calls our “graduate-level material” aimed at those working toward their Ph.D’s. In that spirit, freshmen take note: some readers seem not to be aware that the bearded French narrator of those “joga bonito” Nike commercials is not a character actor, or at least did not start out as a character actor. He is, in fact, a former player named Eric Cantona, who starred in the 1990’s for Manchester United and, briefly, the French national team.

He did indeed play with flair but was nearly as well known for his frequently violent temper — his official bio chronicles no less than a dozen eruptions — and, particularly in England, for his Delphic pronouncements at press conferences. Here is a video clip of Cantona from his heyday in action on and off the pitch. You’ll get a glimpse of his famous “karate kick” of a fan who made the mistake of heckling him just after he had been sent off, plus some of the headlines that ensued (like “Le Nutter”) and his brilliantly gnomic statement at a press conference later, explaining why there were so many reporters there to talk to him about this incident: “When the seagulls follow the trawler it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.” Hard to argue with that. — R.M.
