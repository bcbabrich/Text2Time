Charles Newland, director of the city's Bureau of Economic Development, said that before the turnaround, there was no commercial office market to speak of. ''Buildings were being abandoned and demolished because they were becoming safety hazards,'' he said. ''Class A office space was going for about $5 a square foot.'' He estimated that office space now rents for $14 to $18 a square foot. CURRENT projects range from construction of new office towers to conversions and gut renovations of former hotels and warehouses, with many a mixture of both. The city has been particularly supportive of rehabilitation efforts that aim to preserve the city's architecturally significant commercial buildings, of which it has many.

Most developers are taking advantage of such incentives as the 1981 Federal Tax Investment Credit Program and loans made available through Albany's Industrial Development Agency. Last year, a municipal tax-abatement program was passed that allows the city to abate up to 50 percent of the first year's property taxes for qualifying projects.

At the forefront of Albany's commercial revitalization is the Norstar Bancorp project. Early in 1984 the bank, the state's 11th largest, announced that it would move its headquarters from the Albany suburb of Guilderland into space it would create out of the landmark Union Station building downtown. The turn-of-the-century Beaux Arts granite structure on Broadway between Columbia and Steuben Streets, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1900 for the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company. It had been vacant since 1968.

Norstar paid the state $450,000 for the structure. Included in the sale agreement was a commitment from the bank to put $8 million into restoration and reconstruction. The building's huge central waiting room, two asymmetrical three-story wings and a new 30,000-square-foot mezzanine level are being made into 80,000 square feet of office and operations space for the bank. The city has put up a two-story parking facility next to the station on the east side and a public park across the street on the west.

Five blocks to the south, a site is being prepared for Keycorp Plaza, an $18 million office and retail complex to be built by the Omni Development Corporation. The major component of the project will be a 14-story corporate headquarters building for Keycorp, which now owns the site but will sell it to Omni before construction begins. The new structure will have 225,000 square feet of space, of which Keycorp will lease 100,000 square feet.

Keycorp's plans also include the restoration of three bank buildings on the site, which is bounded by Beaver, State, South Pearl and Green Streets. It will be linked to a cobblestoned, gas-lit promenade planned by the city along Beaver Street between Broadway and the Empire State Plaza. The project is expected to be completed by mid-1987.

Local developers are scurrying to meet the demand for office space by building and renovating throught the central business district. Among the most active are Walter Ucilini, a national developer of commercial properties who is involved in several downtown projects; John Garry, a former District Attorney, and Herbert Ellis, who transformed the old Y. M. C. A. on North Pearl Street into an office building and health club.
