''If we don't get anywhere in committee,'' he said, ''then we'll try to take the fight to the floor. We think we have enough votes to do that for sure because all you need is a quarter of the platform committee or six state delegations.''

In recent months, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Weld have been in contact with other party moderates about the abortion issue, among them Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Asked how many other governors and leading party moderates could be expected to join the fight for the substitute plank, Mr. Wilson replied, ''We'll begin to see now that we have a plank to propose.''

Governor Whitman's office said she was on vacation in Alaska and would have no immediate comment.

Mr. Wilson said that the Dole campaign was told earlier this week of the plan to offer the substitute, but that ''I don't know what they intend to do with it.''

Mr. Dole, after considerable backing and filling, recently tried to head off any embarrassing convention split on abortion. He proposed that the party retain its long-standing anti-abortion plank but also add a tolerance plank, which would welcome party members who have ''deeply held and sometimes differing views on issues of personal conscience like abortion.''

After the wording of the suggested substitute plank was released today, the Dole campaign released the following statement: ''Bob Dole's long and consistent pro-life record is as strong as his belief that the Republican Party is an inclusive party. The issue of platform language is one that will ultimately be decided by the platform committee.''
