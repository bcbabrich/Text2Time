She was 11 when the New York City Ballet production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" came to Los Angeles. She was cast as a bug. Standing on stage, gazing up at company principals like Edward Villella, Arthur Mitchell and Suzanne Farrell, she became infatuated with dance. Five years later, Ms. Watts came to New York to study at the School of American Ballet. She was nearly expelled for defying every rule -- often missing class, cavalierly showing up late -- penchants that might have precluded a dancing career were it not for Balanchine, who saw the potential in the skinny, rebellious girl with the broad shoulders, amazing extensions and powerful jump.

"Balanchine made me dance," she now says.

"Don't be reverent about my ballets; just dance," he would tell her.

So she danced, and sometimes even she was pleased with her performance. "There are nights when you are lucky enough to tap into something about yourself that you are unaware of and can't possibly control," Ms. Watts says, "and somehow at that moment other people can view it or sense it or feel it."

Yet she never relinquished her defiance. She was outspoken, undiplomatic, possessed of great intelligence and a greater ability to charm and offend. Capable of warm generosity or a rudeness that could verge on cruelty, she was given to extremes of emotion that inspired extremes of approval and disapproval from others. As the years went by, she established herself, on stage and off, as a fiercely commanding presence whose preferred attire was a baseball cap and an oversize T-shirt, a controversial figure who was never what ballerinas are supposed to be. "I guess that ballerinas are supposed to be quiet," she says.

Nothing made her more controversial than her long relationship with Peter Martins, with whom she lived, worked and fought bitterly, often in public. The union began in 1969, when she was 16 and he was a 23-year-old principal dancer with City Ballet, and continued into the 1980's, when he became the company's artistic director. "We grew up together" is how they both tended to put it. And they stayed tied in ways that suggest that certain bonds run long and deep and are difficult to sever.

"As a dancer, Heather was wiry and weird and didn't dance in a usual fashion," Mr. Martins recalls. "She could do classical things, lyrical things. You couldn't categorize her."
