But the college has been embroiled in frequent disputes. It was one of three institutions censured this year by the American Association of University Professors, which accused the college of ousting faculty members without cause or due process and cited the dismissal of teachers who had supported a movement to establish a student government.

"It appeared to us this was not an institution that met minimal standards for accreditation," said Lesley Lee Francis, associate secretary of the professors' association.

The college said the association, which is not an accrediting body, has no jurisdiction over the institution. The regional accrediting body, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, investigated accusations against the college but left its accreditation intact.

During the investigation, the college sued the association, one of many legal actions the institution is involved in. The college itself is being sued by four students who accuse it of attracting them with inflated claims about resources and programs and then defaming them by linking them to a pipe-bomb explosion on campus last year. The college denies the contentions and is countersuing.

The college has also filed suit against the School of Visual Arts, a New York-based institution that is starting a Savannah campus; its president, David Rhodes, and eight former Savannah College of Art and Design teachers, administrators and trustees, accusing them of conspiring to destroy the college's business and reputation.

All have denied the charges and several are countersuing, accusing the college of using malicious litigation to silence critics and help it win approval of the bond issue. In his lawsuit and his statement to the authority, Mr. Minsky, whose group is representing the four students and a former teacher, accuses the college of misrepresenting its curriculum, employment conditions, equipment, buildings and financial practices and of lying on its bond application. 'We're Very Comfortable'

Still, Elizabeth Jick of Oppenheimer & Company, which plans to sell the $23 million bond issue, said, "We're very comfortable with the credit and the people of Savannah College of Art and Design."
