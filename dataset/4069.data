But, Cadet Woodall added, ''You come to the realization that human beings are human beings.''

Even though the rape allegation recalls an incident two years ago in which several football players at the academy were accused of groping female cadets during an athletic rally, male and female cadets here said that they experienced few if any difficulties with each other.

One male cadet said that he had taken his three-mile jog that morning with a female cadet whom he counted as one of his best friends. Another male cadet noted that while there were only 525 female cadets to the 3,468 male cadets, two of the six cadets on the senior brigade staff were female.

As students walked from one building to another between classes today, young men and young women strode in tandem. In fact, in their hats, crisply pressed uniforms and monotonously formal voices, they were sometimes practically indistinguishable.

''From the time I got here, I couldn't believe how well everyone gets along,'' said Eric Tisland, 21, a second-year cadet from Blackduck, Minn. ''I assumed there would be more of a conflict, but there isn't.''

More than a dozen cadets interviewed here today said that the academy devoted significant time and resources to teaching male and female cadets to behave responsibly toward each other. They said that when cadets first arrived, they attended seminars and discussions about sexual harassment and date rape. Not only are women encouraged to report men who act or talk inappropriately, cadets said, but men are also instructed to lodge complaints about women who do so.

Lindy Williams, 18, a first-year cadet from Tampa, Fla., said she actually felt protected and secure among her male classmates here. She said that on Wednesday morning, for example, when a genuine-sounding scream was broadcast over her dormitory intercom as a sort of Halloween trick, three male cadets were at her door within 10 seconds to make sure that she and her roommates were all right. ''One of the principal rules of conduct they teach us is consideration of others,'' Cadet Williams said.

As a result, she said, ''You have this idealistic view of a place like West Point, like it's different from everywhere else. This is a wake-up call.''
