In a move intended to enhance security for its 9,000 residents, this Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank has ordered visiting Arab workers to wear white identification badges. Critics from both the Israeli right and left have compared the badges to the yellow Star of David that Jews were forced to wear by the Nazis.

The new tags are marked with the Ariel council's name and logo, and the words ''Foreign Worker'' in Hebrew. The Arab workers, who mostly work in construction and gardening, pick up the plastic-coated cards at the security booth when they enter the settlement. In exchange, they must deposit their regular Israeli identification cards. Measure Is Defended

Zahava Guntman, a member of the Ariel council, told Israel radio that she did not understand why people were so disturbed about the issue. She compared the identification badges to the special license plates required for cars owned by Arab residents of the occupied territories.

But the measure has been criticized by many sectors of the Israeli public. ''This specific policy omits all sensitivity in a way which creates concern,'' said Ehud Olmert, a Government minister regarded as a hard-liner within the rightist Likud Party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
