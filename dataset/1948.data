THE DAY

Senator Barack Obama got both help and trouble from his family Saturday. The trouble: An aunt from Kenya was reported to be living in Boston public housing even though she was ordered to leave the country in 2004. The help: Vice President Dick Cheney, a distant cousin of Mr. Obama, endorsed his opponent, Senator John McCain, providing much fodder for gleeful Democrats.

* Republicans went after Mr. Obama on patriotism. Seizing on Mr. Obama’s remark that his caucus victory in Iowa ”vindicated” his faith in America, Mr. McCain said “my country has never had to prove anything to me.” At a Sarah Palin rally in Florida, the crowd chanted, “John McCain, not Hussein.”

* Lots of laugh lines. After Virginia and Pennsylvania, Mr. McCain headed to New York to appear on “Saturday Night Live.” Mr. Obama, on the road in Nevada, Colorado and Missouri, beat Mr. McCain to the punch line by congratulating him on the Cheney endorsement. “He really earned it,” Mr. Obama said.





Takeaway: If it looks like the two candidates and their running mates are crossing paths, that’s because they are. The candidates are practically living in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida as the race boils down to a handful of states. Mr. Obama remains ahead in all four. —Peter Baker

CLOSING ARGUMENTS

Senator John McCain

At a rally in Newport News, Va.:

“With our troops engaged in two wars, with a force in need of rebuilding, we’re getting a glimpse of what one party rule would look like under Obama, Pelosi and Reid, and we don’t like that. Apparently it starts with lowering our defenses and raising our taxes. ”

Senator Barack Obama

At a rally in Pueblo, Colo.:

“George Bush may be in an undisclosed location, but Dick Cheney’s out there on the campaign trail because he’d be delighted to pass the baton to John McCain. He knows that with John McCain you get a twofer: George Bush’s economic policy and Dick Cheney’s foreign policy. But that’s a risk we cannot afford to take.”

NOW PLAYING

McCain: “Freedom.” Swelling music, flags galore and emotionally powerful footage of Mr. McCain as a prisoner of war and returning home. His closing argument is the same as the one that brought his campaign back to life a year ago: “I’ve served my country since I was 17 years old. And, spent five years longing for her shores. I came home dedicated to a cause greater than my own.” End thought: “Don’t hope for a stronger America. Vote for one.”

Obama: “Rearview Mirror.” Back to the McCain=Bush argument, while hitting back at Mr. McCain over taxes. A driver sees President Bush in the rearview mirror, Mr. McCain in the sideview mirror and ominous warnings about Mr. McCain’s tax policies in road signs. Ending: Bush and McCain together in that rearview mirror. “Look behind you. We can’t afford more of the same.”

THE ROAR

“I believe the right leader for this moment in history is Senator John McCain. John is a man who understands the danger facing America. He’s a man who has looked into the face of evil and not flinched. He’s a man who’s comfortable with responsibility and has been since he joined the armed forces at the age of 17. He’s earned our support and confidence, and the time is now to make him commander-in-chief.”

Vice President Dick Cheney, endorsing John McCain

“Barack Obama is going to win. He’s got a good chance because he’s a Kenyan and you can’t beat a Kenyan at a race.”

“John McCain! Not Hussein!”

Chant at a rally for Gov. Sarah Palin in New Port Richey, Fla.

“First order of business for Sarah Palin on her return to Alaska: Order the Alaska National Guard across the border to Canada.”-

“Mark” on the Caucus blog, in a comment responding to a report that Ms. Palin had been prank called by a pair of Canadian comedians posing as French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

ON DECK

If you live in Pennsylvania or Ohio, you might want to stay away from the airports as the candidates buzz in and out these next two days.

* Senator John McCain will campaign Sunday in Pennsylvania, including Scranton, the hometown of the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., then heads to New Hampshire. Senator Barack Obama makes three stops in Ohio – Columbus, Cincinnati and Cleveland.

* Florida heat: Both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain end their day making the long nighttime flights down to the Sunshine State — Mr. McCain to Miami for a post-midnight rally, Mr. Obama to Jacksonville even later, but he’s going to bed.

* Top campaign strategists and campaign surrogates fan out for a final pre-election Sunday TV television show blitz. The clash with the biggest chance of blood left on the studio floor will come on “This Week” on ABC: featuring Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, and David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s chief strategist. Could be a rematch of their verbal slugfest on “Fox News Sunday” three weeks ago. These boys don’t seem to like each other much.
