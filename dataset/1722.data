What makes a music festival reflect the place where it’s being held? Historically, that connection has been key to its success. In the 1960s, Woodstock and Monterey Pop crystallized the hippie subcultures of the East and West Coasts. More recently, Bonnaroo in Tennessee gives a bucolic home to the jam bands that have always had one foot in Southern rock, and Coachella captures the stylish mix of indie rock and dance music endemic to Southern California.

What about All Points West? It’s produced by the people behind Coachella, and for the last two years the big question has been whether it would have its own distinct character or be merely a smaller imitation of Coachella. (Well, the convenience of the ferries may have been a more immediate concern.)

In some ways All Points West succeeds beautifully at framing a New York-centric event. Jay-Z was an inspired booking, and there is a strain of New York hip-hop historicism running through the lineup, with Q-Tip, Organized Konfusion and Kool Keith. It’s also not hard to find young New York rock bands: MGMT, Vampire Weekend, the National. Hip-hop is the exception here, however, not the rule, and for every of-the-moment Brooklyn art-rock band that is NOT on the bill (Animal Collective, Dirty Projectors, Grizzly Bear) there are another two or three from England or Texas or Sweden. But is that a good thing or a bad thing? New York is cosmopolitan, and omnivorous in every way. A festival that reflects our tastes should be like a United Nations of pop music. Right?
