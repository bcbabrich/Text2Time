Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said his client will enter a plea of not guilty to the new charges when he appears before a judge on July 9. “Mr. Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false and he expects to be fully vindicated,” Mr. Brafman said in a statement. “Furthermore to charge Mr. Weinstein as a predator when the interactions were each consensual is simply not justified.”

The new indictment puts increased pressure on Mr. Weinstein. The original indictment contained a top charge of first-degree rape, which carries a penalty of between five and 25 years in prison. But Mr. Weinstein is now charged with committing first-degree sexual crimes against more than one person, which is considered predatory sexual assault. If convicted on that charge, he faces a minimum of 10 years in prison and could be sentenced to 25 years to life.

The predatory sexual assault law was not passed until 2006, so it could not be applied to the 2004 encounter involving Ms. Evans. But the other two women mentioned in the new indictment have said they were assaulted in 2006 and 2013, providing prosecutors a basis to charge Mr. Weinstein as a “predator,” law enforcement officials said.

Prosecutors said they are still interviewing witnesses and potential victims and the indictment against Mr. Weinstein may be updated again with more charges.

It remained unclear if the new charges stemmed from accusations already made public against Mr. Weinstein or concerned a woman who has yet to come forward on social media or in news reports.

Two of the women who have publicly accused Mr. Weinstein of attacking them in Manhattan are Paz de la Huerta and Mimi Haleyi. Ms. de la Huerta, an actress known for her work on “Boardwalk Empire,” told Vanity Fair last fall that Mr. Weinstein raped her on two separate occasions in her SoHo apartment in 2010.

Ms. Haleyi, who formerly worked as a production assistant on a Weinstein Company television series, told reporters at an October news conference that Mr. Weinstein had invited her to his SoHo apartment in 2006 for what she assumed was a professional meeting. She said she had said “No” several times in the previous weeks to his flirtatious advances, making it clear she had no romantic interest in him.

Once she was in his apartment, however, Ms. Haleyi said Mr. Weinstein backed her into a child’s bedroom, held her down on a bed and “orally forced himself” on her. “I tried to get him off me and kept asking him to stop but it was impossible,” she said at the news conference. “He was extremely persistent and overpowering.”
