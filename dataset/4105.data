The imports of coats from Ukraine, estimated at $30 million a year, are tiny compared with America's yearly apparel import bill of $30 billion, according to the United States Association of Importers and Apparel, a trade group. But shipments have increased sharply. In the year ended last September, Ukraine exported 88,898 dozen women's coats -- or 1,066,776 coats -- to the United States, up 155 percent from the year before, the Commerce Department said.

By 1994, Ukraine's coat exports to the United States had mushroomed to such an extent that they were outstripped only by coats from the Dominican Republic and Guatemala, two countries to which the United States gives preferential trade. Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Dominican Republic and Guatemala do not face quotas on women's coats.

The sudden surge of Ukrainian imports brought pressure for import restraint from domestic coat makers, who were supported by Senator George Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, and the Commerce Department. Textiles and apparel remain among the most protected sectors of trade in most nations, even though the new rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will eliminate many curbs. And even without the quota, American producers are protected by a tariff of 21.5 percent on wool coat imports.

The Ukrainian coat imports were classified as "disruptive" to the American women's manufacturing industry. The disruptive finding, though vague, was sufficient to justify imposing a quota in a niche of the American apparel industry where employment has declined fairly steadily for years.

According to a senior official at the United States Trade Representative's office, some of the Ukrainian coats were landing in the United States at $212 a dozen. "This was not the absolute lowest, but among the lowest" price of imported coats, the official said, adding, "they're very nice looking coats." Indeed, the coats made in Ukraine have a reputation in the industry for being of higher quality than those sewn in other developing countries.

In theory, the coat quota was negotiated with Ukraine's Government. But the Ukrainian officials were informed by Washington that the United States could unilaterally impose import quotas on them if they did not voluntarily accept restrictions. Besides Ukraine, the United States has quota agreements on women's wool coats with 15 other countries, including Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland.

The quota on Ukrainian coats maintains imports at roughly last year's levels. The quota, the trade representative's office says, was set during negotiations with the Ukrainians at 85,000 dozen for 1995, or 1,020,000. And an extra quota of 25,000 coats, which can be added to shipments in 1995, was set for the last three months of 1994.
