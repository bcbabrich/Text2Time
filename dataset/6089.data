WASHINGTON, Sept. 2—The Labor Department reported today that the unemployment rate rose two‐tenths of a percentage point in August, to 7.1 percent of the work force, and said that the increase reflected almost exclusively higher unemployment among black workers.

Civil rights leaders immediately asserted that the new figures confirmed charges by black leaders earlier this week that the Carter Administration had neglected blacks, the poor and the cities.

President Carter, apparently spurred by the August unemployment results and by the criticism of the black leaders, today asked Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall to prepare a report on the reasons for the rising unemployment among blacks and on steps for attacking the problem.

Jody Powell, the White House press secretary, said that the President had asked that the report be ready for a meeting he has scheduled with the Congressional Black Caucus next week.
