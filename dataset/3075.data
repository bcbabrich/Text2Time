The private holding company of Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH-MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is planning to announce today that it has formed a joint venture with TH Lee, Putnam Capital to create a European leveraged buyout firm that would also make other private investments.

TH Lee, Putnam Capital is itself a joint venture between Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P. and Putnam Investments. The partnership is run by Thomas H. Lee, who is best known for buying the Snapple beverage business for $135 million in 1992 and selling it to the Quaker Oats Company for $1.7 billion two years later. Mr. Lee has just raised a $6.1 billion private equity fund, the largest ever.

The new venture is the latest involving leveraged buyout firms in the United States to set up outposts overseas. Many firms now say that Europe offers more opportunities than the United States. Private American equity firms bought 26 European companies in 2000, up from 7 in 1997, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.

Mr. Arnault's holding company, Groupe Arnault, and TH Lee, Putnam Capital will begin assembling a team of about a dozen investment professionals for the joint venture, to be called TH Lee Groupe Arnault Partners. The venture will have offices in London, Paris and perhaps other sites and hopes to be making investments in European companies as early as this summer. The firm plans to focus on the financial sector, business and information services, telecommunications, media, and consumer products.
