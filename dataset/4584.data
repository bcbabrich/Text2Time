"It's not so different from paying ransom to buy back your baby," said Constance Lowenthal, executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research, an organization that specializes in tracking stolen art.

She was speaking of the out-of-court settlement made final last Tuesday in which the Government of Germany, acting in the name of a small Lutheran church in the medieval town of Quedlinburg, paid $2.75 million to a family in Texas for returning and relinquishing all claims to the glittering, thousand-year-old treasures stolen by an American soldier in the closing days of World War II. Ms. Lowenthal spoke for many who were shocked by the settlement since the heirs of Lieut. Joe Tom Meador, who died in 1980, had admitted in court that he "inappropriately removed" the treasures.

There are practical reasons for paying ransom for stolen art rather than pursuing a case in court. In the art world, the question of who owns what can be anything but clear-cut, especially when works from ancient civilizations are involved, and there is little desire to set precedents that might later be used to question who owns antiquities now in major museums.

But will the Quedlinburg settlement establish a precedent for the payment of multi-million dollar shakedowns ("a finder's fee," the Germans called it) for the return of other World War II war spoils? Or will a more generous spirit take hold?
