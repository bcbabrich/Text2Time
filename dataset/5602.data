CBS News, again retooling its morning news program after years of ratings failure, will not renew the contracts of Maria Shriver and Forrest Sawyer as co-anchors of the ''CBS Morning News,'' according to network officials.

In fact, the ''CBS Morning News'' in its present form will cease to exist by fall, when CBS plans to implement a new type of broadcast in the morning time period. That new program, to be outlined to CBS affiliates in two weeks, is planned as a radical departure from the traditional news program format, and will probably not be named ''Morning News.''

While the three networks' morning programs traditionally have been based in New York, with a male and a female anchor, plans for the new CBS program call for a regional format, with hosts in Los Angeles and possibly Chicago and Dallas, as well as New York, according to CBS News executives who asked that their names not be used.

Ms. Shriver has been asked by the network to accept the position in Los Angeles, but she has not yet agreed to do so. Mr. Sawyer will seek reassignment within CBS News. He has been alternating as anchor of the ''CBS Weekend News'' in addition to his morning post. Other Departures From Form
