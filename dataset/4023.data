Beauty is definitely not in the eye of the beholder, and Merce Cunningham's ''Ocean,'' a 90-minute dance work bathed in a theatrical blend of light and sound, is beautiful by any definition.

You don't need to be a Kantian to set up criteria for beauty here. You need only trust your instincts as ''Ocean,'' with its elegance (who will call it ugly?), is presented through Sunday by the Lincoln Center Festival '96.

Created in Brussels in 1994, then performed abroad and in Berkeley, Calif., the piece is now being seen outdoors for the first time. The festival created the perfect setting for a major New York premiere on Tuesday night at Damrosch Park.

The performance, beginning at 9:30 P.M. to benefit from the darkness, was virtually devoid of raindrops. Surrounded by the Metropolitan Opera House, the New York State Theater, a high-rise and a housing project, ''Ocean'' seemed an oasis in an urban grove, its small round stage encircled by the audience and technical paraphernalia.
