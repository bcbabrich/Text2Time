WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 (UPI)—Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr. of Mississippi said tonight that the Rev. Dr. Martin Lutner King Jr. had left “a trail of blood and bitterness.”

Mr. Johnson was asked at a news conference to comment on a recent charge by J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that Dr. King was a “notorious liar.”

“Of course I agree with him, as do thousands of people,” Mr. Johnson replied.

He said the civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner “has left a trail of blood and bitterness. Rather than a man of peace, he is a man of division and dissension.”

Mr. Johnson also attacked Charles Evers, a Mississippi Negro leader, saying that “members of his own race have little confidence in him and will have even less because of his wild statements.”
