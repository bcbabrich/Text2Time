''No one among the analysts can make out whose proposals are better,'' said Damian Fraser, the head of Latin American research for UBS Warburg. ''Labastida has more experience in government and represents continuity. Fox has a somewhat greater commitment to free market policies.''

The final polls showed Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox in a tie, with Mr. Cardenas well behind. Mr. Fox comes from the moderate conservative National Action Party, known as the PAN, but spearheaded a diverse group of Mexicans who want a change from the ruling system.

Despite the similarities, Mr. Labastida did score one propaganda coup against Mr. Fox. In a much-discussed television commercial, he showed a video clip of Mr. Fox speaking in English during a visit to the United States, describing a program he set up in Guanajuato to train gardeners for skilled jobs in the United States. Mr. Labastida comes in at the end to say that he planned to create jobs for Mexicans in Mexico.

Even though relations with the United States have never been closer, Mexicans retain a gut wariness of their neighbor. Nationalism was unusually dormant through much of the leading campaigns, but in the final days the PRI revived it with accusations that Mr. Fox received illegal donations from across the border. Mr. Fox denied the allegations.

The two candidates both promised a harder line in defense of Mexican immigrants. Mr. Fox stressed a proposal to make a free labor market in the hemisphere in the coming years to parallel the free trade market, opening the border to the millions of Mexican migrants who now risk their lives to cross it illegally.

Education was another hot-button issue, where Mr. Fox and Mr. Labastida diverged. Mr. Fox made a risky pitch to Catholics, who make up more than 90 percent of the population, suggesting that he would make more room for the Roman Catholic Church in public education. The idea drew a furious response from the PRI, whose anti-clericalism and commitment to nonreligious public schools date back to its founding. It was not clear how the overture played among the voters.

Mr. Labastida also gambled, with a nationally broadcast radio commercial saying he would bring English and computer courses to all public schools. The opposition ridiculed the proposal as impractical and elitist. But PRI media experts found that the advertisement was popular with working class voters, and they kept broadcasting it for an extra two weeks.
