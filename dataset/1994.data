In the icy annals of emperor-penguin research, Apsley Cherry-Garrard has been one-upped.

The British explorer described his research project as “The Worst Journey in the World,” a memoir that has become a classic of the explornography genre. In his 1911 quest to retrieve eggs from an emperor penguin rookery, Cherry-Garrard trekked through the Antarctic winter with temperatures of -70 degrees Fahrenheit. He lost his tent (and, he assumed, any prospect of surviving) when it was blown away during a blizzard by hurricane-force winds. The tent was miraculously found afterwards, and he survived to bring the eggs back to the Natural History Museum in London.

It was a heroic achievement. But for all that Cherry-Garrard endured in that dark, frigid winter, he never, to the best of my knowledge, attempted to measure the rectal temperature of an emperor penguin.

It remained for future researchers to accomplish that feat — and more. They also performed field surgery on an emperor penguin. By taking both the rectal and the core temperatures of emperor penguins at the rookery, they’ve learned the penguins’ secret for surviving the winter without a tent.

The American Physiological Society, which is publishing the French research team’s results, reports that the scientists began their work by “entering into the colony with bulb thermometers” and determining that “huddling penguins maintain a lower rectal temperature than birds which were isolated from the colony.” But that still didn’t quite explain how the penguins conserve enough energy to survive four cold months without eating, so the researchers captured five pairs of the birds and surgically implanted devices to measure the temperature deep inside their bodies.

The scientists found that the incubating birds lowered their core temperatures by two degrees Fahrenheit and kept it fairly constant, affected by neither the cold weather nor the heat generated when the penguins huddled together. The researchers suggest this constant temperature was achieved by a depression in the birds’ metabolic rate, which “explains why the birds neither suffer from hyperthermia despite the very high ambient temperatures within the huddle, nor become hypothermic due to the harsh cold.”

And how did the birds reduce their metabolic rate? “Such depression could be achieved by entering sleep. In fact, during tight huddles, birds were observed with their eyes closed.”

So the emperor penguins were sleeping on the job — not that there’s anything wrong with that. I don’t begrudge them their shuteye, nor all the cinematic adulation they’ve been getting for their perseverance. But the more I hear about what’s been going on in these rookeries, the more impressed I am with the perseverance of penguin researchers. There’s a book in this for one of the thermometer-toting scientists: “The Worst Job in the World.”
