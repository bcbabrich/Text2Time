On the eve of his first venture into the heated world of Soviet politics in the provinces, President Bush was denounced today by the Ukraine's leading independence movement as having been "hypnotized by Gorbachev" at the summit meeting.

The Ukrainian popular movement known as Rukh, the umbrella group for more than a dozen of the republic's opposition parties, offered Mr. Bush an advance sample of the sharp-edged politics that await him in this rich, sprawling republic, which the President will visit on Thursday on his way home from Moscow.

Ukrainian politicians cautioned him today to expect the six-hour visit to be no easy, folksy photo opportunity.

Ivan Drach, the Rukh chairman, said Mr. Bush was so supportive and uncritical of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Mr. Bush would arrive here as the Soviet leader's "messenger," with no real appreciation of the suffering that the Ukrainian republic has seen under the Kremlin because of its yearning for independence.
