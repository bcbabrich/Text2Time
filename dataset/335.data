LOS ANGELES — “Victory!!!”

With that single aggressively punctuated tweet, Phillip Iscove, a creator of the Fox drama “Sleepy Hollow,” summed up what Hollywood writers seemed to be feeling on Tuesday, after a middle-of-the night deal between studios and writers to avert a strike.

Conspicuously not doing a victory lap was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios.

A tentative agreement for a new three-year, master contract with the producers’ alliance and unions representing more than 12,000 television and movie writers was reached at around 1 a.m. on the West Coast. The previous contract expired at midnight, and the Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as early as Tuesday morning. A walkout would have immediately sent late-night comedy shows into reruns and threatened important presentations planned by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC to attract advertising.

The unions declared in an email to members that they had won “unprecedented gains.” Leaders added: “Did we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild’s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.”
