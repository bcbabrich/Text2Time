A committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court filed suit in Little Rock today asking a state court to enforce its recommendation that President Clinton be stripped of his law license for falsely denying under oath that he had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.

The filing set in motion the preparation for a full-fledged trial in a Little Rock courtroom, perhaps as early as this fall, over Mr. Clinton's fitness to be a lawyer.

The lawsuit before the Pulaski County Circuit Court became inevitable last month when the committee said that the president should be disbarred for what it said was ''serious misconduct'' in his testimony in the sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against him by Paula Corbin Jones.

David E. Kendall, a Washington lawyer who is representing Mr. Clinton in the Arkansas case, said tonight, ''We fundamentally disagree with the complaint filed today and will defend vigorously against it.''
