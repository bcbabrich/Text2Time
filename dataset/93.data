Ancram, N.Y. | $5.25 Million

An artist-designed house with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a two-bedroom guesthouse and a swimming pool

The only private residence in the United States designed by Ai Weiwei, this home was commissioned in 2006 by Christopher Tsai, a financier and major collector of work by the Chinese artist. Mr. Ai collaborated with HHF Architects in Switzerland to develop the two-building complex: a blocky main house with a corrugated metal skin and a weathered Corten-steel guesthouse shaped like the letter Y. The property encompasses 37.5 acres in the Hudson Valley, about two hours north of New York City. Hudson, N.Y., with its high-end restaurants, design boutiques and train service, is 13 miles northwest.

Size: 3,509 square feet

Price per square foot: $1,496

Indoors: The minimal interior begins with a short, double-height hallway hung with a Frank Gehry-designed Cloud pendant lamp. The hallway is bounded on one side by the main staircase, and leads into a great room trimmed in gypsum wood. The central feature of this soaring space is a floor-to-ceiling gray-brick chimney.

On the other side of the staircase, flowing into the great room, is a Boffi kitchen that includes a central island embedded with a cooktop. (All of the appliances are from Gaggenau.) The full bathroom on this level, with its sleek white surfaces and rectangular tub, could be used as a powder room or by occupants of a main-floor guest bedroom that has built-in cabinetry and a windowed wall looking out on the landscape.

The two upstairs bedrooms have fixed picture windows and shuttered corrugated metal screens that let in air. The master suite includes a dressing room and a bathroom with floating sinks, a tub and a walk-in glass shower. A double-faced fireplace opens to the bathroom and bedroom.
