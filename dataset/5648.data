The mild hurricane season of 1986 officially ended today with only four tropical storms having become full-fledged hurricanes.

The official season ran from June 1 to Nov. 30, and none of the storms reached the intensity of the record-breaking hurricanes of 1985.

Hurricane Bonnie came ashore in June at Port Arthur, Tex., with relatively mild winds of 80 miles per hour and quickly diminished, although its heavy rains caused some flooding. Hurricane Charlie brushed the coast of the Carolinas in mid-August, and Hurricane Earl faded away in the Atlantic in September. The last hurricane of the season, Frances, formed in the Atlantic Nov. 17 and dissipated five days later on the open sea.
