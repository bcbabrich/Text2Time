Thomas A. Duffy Jr., the special prosecutor who investigates the New York City criminal-justice system, was proposed by Governor Cuomo today as chairman of the State Liquor Authority.

Anthony Gazzara, the current chairman, resigned today, effective March 26, to become vice president for intergovernmental relations at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center of New York.

The Governor described Mr. Duffy, a 44-year-old resident of Great Neck, L.I., as ''a law-enforcement official of impeccable credentials.''

Mr. Cuomo nominated Mr. Duffy as one of the five State Liquor Authority commissioners and said he would designate him as chairman, a $72,100-a-year job.
