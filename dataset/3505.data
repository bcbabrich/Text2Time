If Juli Inkster is to win her third major of the year, she will have to catch Laura Davies.

Inkster fell four strokes back today as Davies shot a three-under-par 69 for a three-round total of 207, nine under par for the tournament, the du Maurier Classic. Davies used her length off the tee to overpower most of the par 5's and held a two-stroke lead over Dawn Coe-Jones of Canada, who shot a 72 today. Catriona Matthew of Scotland, who also shot a 72 today, was in third place, three strokes behind Davies.

Inkster struggled to a 74 today, leaving her at five under par for the tournament, tied with Karrie Webb, who shot a 66 to roar into contention.

The final round at Priddis Greens Golf and Country Club will be pressure packed for Inkster, who would clinch a spot in the L.P.G.A. Hall of Fame with a victory. And Inkster is also trying to become only the second player to win three of the four L.P.G.A. modern majors in the same year, joining Pat Bradley, who won three majors in 1986.

While Inkster was not thrilled with her performance today, she hardly saw her four-shot deficit as insurmountable.
