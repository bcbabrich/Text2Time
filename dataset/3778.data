New Jersey's poorest city, Camden, may need more oversight from state officials, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday. The Governor said that she would not recommend a state takeover but might seek legislation to give her administration a greater hand in Camden's financial affairs. The fiscal year is more than half over, Camden has yet to approve its budget and the state has had to give the city an extra $8.3 million to help with its $11 million deficit, said Christopher B. Wolf, a spokesman for the State Department of Community Affairs.

Mayor Arnold W. Webster said he welcomed financial assistance from the state, but he criticized state officials for failing to cooperate with his administration in solving the city's financial problems.
