The musician Travis Barker and the DJ Adam Goldstein have announced that they will play their first show together since they were in a post-concert plane crash in September, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Goldstein, who performs as DJ AM, and Mr. Barker, the drummer for the punk band Blink-182, were flying together on a private plane on Sept. 19 after playing a free concert in Columbia, S.C., when the plane crashed, injuring them and killing Mr. Barker’s bodyguard and his personal assistant, as well as the plane’s pilot and co-pilot. Mr. Barker recently filed suit against several companies in connection with the crash. According to The A.P., Mr. Barker and Mr. Goldstein will perform together as TRVSDJAM at a New Year’s Eve party at The Lot in West Hollywood.
