Those two countries were South Africa and the United States of America. As a junior tennis player in the middle and late 1950's, Ashe was not allowed to play in major tournaments in Kentucky and in the state where he was born and lived, Virginia.

He would eventually be allowed to play throughout both those nations.

This is recalled now because as the United States Open begins in Flushing Meadows today, demonstrations are being organized against apartheid in South Africa, and a resolution is to be submitted to the City Council that would ban South Africans from participating in events on public property. The United States Tennis Center is on a site owned by the City of New York. The organizers of the demonstration would seek to have all South Africans barred from participating in sports in the United States, just as individual tennis players aren't allowed to participate in Grand Prix events in Sweden and the Netherlands and New Zealand and Japan and Eastern European countries and many African countries.

South Africa as a nation is also barred from sending teams to the Olympics and the Davis Cup and the Federation Cup and world soccer and cricket and rugby events.

The position of the United States Tennis Association, which organizes the Open, is that these 15 or so South Africans invited to play in the Open are individuals and with no known political associations with their government.

A similar position is taken by the State Department.

''Visa requests are taken on a case-by-case basis,'' said Anita Stockman, a spokeswoman for the State Department. ''We look for specific things if we're going to keep somebody out. It's called a watch list. Are they known murderers? Have they acted contrary to U.S. laws? But there's no blanket ruling.''
