WHAT a dream job! Do what you want by day. Then, around 8:30, punch in, have an evening snack and maybe read The New Yorker waiting by the bedside to induce drowsiness. At 11, without watching one tale of urban mayhem with the obligatory bloody sidewalk, you doze off in your clock-free private room for at least eight hours of uninterrupted slumber. Barring overtime, of course.

No car alarms, telephones, not even a neighbor's insomniac German shepherd to disturb your monitored bliss. (All right, a few wires are taped to your head.) But next day, you awaken refreshed, eat breakfast, collect $40 and leave.

If you can handle this much pressure, call (914) 997-5825.

There is, of course, more to this line of work than meets the eye, even in the dark of the special sleep rooms here on the fourth floor of the Westchester Division of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where infrared television cameras silently stare down. This is the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center, one of the country's few research sites for the emerging science of sleep. Here, they quietly unravel the mysteries of those momentous moments of mental darkness that seem so empty, yet are so vital.

"There are a lot of misconceptions and myths about sleep," says Margaret Moline, the center director, who needs a good eight hours of sleep herself to function well. (Hers starts after the news.)
