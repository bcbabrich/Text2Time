Heartened by some soothing words from a governor of the Federal Reserve Board and some good news on inflation, the bond market rallied yesterday and carried a depressed stock market with it.

The one exception was the Dow Jones industrial average. It rose for much of the day but was dragged down in the session's last 30 minutes. Most of the fall was attributed to a single tobacco stock, Philip Morris, which was hurt by negative comments last Friday by a Government regulator.

And some investors were still nervous about inflation, at least judging by the price of gold, which Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, recently cited as an important barometer of inflation fears. In New York, spot gold futures specifying April delivery rose $2.70, to $382.50 an ounce. Economically Sensitive Stocks

Nonetheless, economically sensitive stocks like United Technologies, Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, and Pacific Gas and Electric benefited from the stock rally, as well as technology stocks like MCI Communications, Nextel, and Comcast, which announced a new alliance.
