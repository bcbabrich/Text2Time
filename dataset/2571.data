Wal-Mart Stores has begun the first major field test of its progress toward its goal of having its top 100 suppliers use radio tags to track their shipments by the end of the year.

The company said yesterday that it had begun to receive radio-tagged shipments of 21 products from eight manufacturers at a distribution center in Sanger, Tex. It said it was also using the technology, known as radio frequency identification, to track the goods as they are sent out to seven of its Supercenter stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth region.

The radio tagging is intended to reduce theft, better match supplies to demand for particular products and speed distribution. But the technology's supporters need to overcome concerns about its accuracy and cost.

In addition to such economic questions, Wal-Mart and the manufacturers are also confronting critics concerned about whether radio tagging will eventually allow retailers -- or anyone with a radio scanner -- to track what consumers do with products after they leave the store.
