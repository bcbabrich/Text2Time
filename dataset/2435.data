An ultra-Orthodox protester stabbed and lightly wounded three participants in the annual Gay Pride march in Jerusalem that attracted an estimated 2,000 people, the police said. The attacker was among about a dozen ultra-Orthodox demonstrators arrested as the march worked its way through the city, said Shmulik Ben-Ruby, a police spokesman. The march faced opposition from Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious leaders. The city's ultra-Orthodox mayor, Uri Lupolianski, had sought to ban it, but a court overruled him. Greg Myre (NYT)
