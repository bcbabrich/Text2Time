James M. Markham's article ''Who Owns the Past?'' (April 27), on East Germany's use of German history and conservative historical figures such as Luther and Bismarck in its quest for popular acceptance, mirrors events in almost all Leninist Communist states.

Stalin long ago rehabilitated Ivan the Terrible and declared Soviet and Russian history a continuous thread.

The Polish pseudo-Communists have rebuilt the royal castle in Warsaw and even reintroduced the Polish officer's unique four-cornered cap. Nicolae Ceausescu in Rumania has propagated the Roman and Dracula legends and facilitated the restoration of functioning churches. The Chinese take great pride in the excavation and display of imperial artifacts.

Similar processes are at work elsewhere in the Communist world, revealing once again the romantic and even nationalist roots of Marxism and the needs of all states for a legitimacy that the general populace and anti-Communist nationalists might accept.
