Responding to Russian complaints of rude treatment by consular officers at the American Embassy here, Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said today that he had taken steps to improve the visa application process.

Mr. Pickering said he had brought in specialists to monitor the "comportment and deportment" of officers as they conducted interviews, as well as Russian-language experts to study their "use of language."

Mr. Pickering said the embassy had introduced an express line for some applicants to speed the process and to make it less stressful. In an experiment, a handful of accredited tourist agencies will be allowed to apply for visas for their business travelers, he added.

To underwrite some of the costs of a new computer system for issuing and checking visas, the State Department has begun charging Russians a $20 fee for each application, effective today. Up to now the visas had been free. A single-entry visa now costs $20, while a multi-entry visa costs $120.
