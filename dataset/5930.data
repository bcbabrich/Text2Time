To the Editor:

The short ''Day by Day'' feature about mistranslations in the New York City subway system (''Ins and Outs of Translation,'' Aug. 27) only touched on a problem that is reaching epidemic proportions in America: the sad state of linguistics in government and private industry.

G.M. had to withdraw its Nova model from the Latin American market when the company discovered that ''no va'' in Spanish means ''it doesn't go.''

An Iranian construction crew had to grind its operations to a halt when the workers puzzled over ''wet sheep'' (meaning ''hydraulic ram'') in their instruction manual. And we have learned how the term ''software'' was incorrectly translated into Indonesian to mean ''underwear.''

Having been in the translation business for more than 30 years, we have collected dozens of examples of these mistranslations. While humorous, they cost the public and private sectors millions. They can even shatter the delicate framework of international relations. A letter to an official of the People's Republic of China, for example, translated in the florid style of the Chinese written in Taiwan, would trigger a political fiasco.
