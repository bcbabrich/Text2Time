"That hearing is now up in the air," Samerjan said.

Despite the promise held out by the talks, the Devils nonetheless pressed their case yesterday that the authority had defaulted on their lease and thus provided the legal opening to leave on Thursday.

The team claims 13 defaults, including not sharing a $4 million payment from Harry M. Stevens, the concessionaire, and suspending its lease during the N.H.L. lockout. Lou Lamoriello, the president of the Devils, alleged in an affidavit that Mulcahy admitted that suspension was designed to deprive the Devils of "its pro rata share of suite revenues."

Without citing Nashville by name, the team scorned the authority's request for evidence of any talks between the Devils and any suitors. Even if the talks had occurred, the team argued, such legal discovery "would have a disruptive effect" and grant the authority "a seat at the negotiating table." The team added, "The authority should not be permitted to rummage about in the alleged business negotiations."

The team rebutted claims that moving would make it impossible to lure another hockey team or damage the public interest, in light of the authority's skills in luring the Devils from Colorado and the Giants, the Jets and the Nets from New York.

The team argued that the authority "has never acted as if it believes the arguments it is now making."
