I hope your article will convince people that food allergies are serious and can be life threatening. Family and friends have accused me of overreacting when I tell them that my son cannot touch (and certainly not eat) even a trace of forbidden foods. Now, if only you had included a recipe for an egg-free, butter-free, milk-free cake (with frosting) for his upcoming birthday!
