DUBLIN, Ohio — Because of bad weather in the morning, Rory Sabbatini didn’t start his second round at the Memorial until well after 3 p.m. To pass the time, he watched a documentary about the reggae star Bob Marley. Playing in overcast, windy conditions, Sabbatini scored so well he could be forgiven for whistling “The Sun Is Shining” from Marley’s song list.

With his second consecutive 69, Sabbatini took a one-stroke lead at the halfway point, at six-under. His best finish in 2012 was a tie for ninth in his first start, the Tournament of Champions. In his previous start, a tie for 47th at Colonial, Sabbatini birdied four of his final eight holes to build some much-needed momentum.

“On Sunday I was playing awfully and managed to turn things around over the last eight holes,” Sabbatini said, “and I think that kind of maybe flicked a switch on for me and kind of reminded me of what I can do. So coming into this week, I was definitely a little more adamant and a little more positive about my game, and it’s just, it’s all so fortuitous.”

Sabbatini, a six-time winner on the tour, said he was inspired by the Marley documentary. “Great life lesson,” he said. “I’ve actually always loved his music, and I’ve known a lot about him, but just really to see his attitude towards life and just his attitude in general is admirable and something that all of us could only aspire to be.”

As for what he aspires to shoot in the third round, Sabbatini said, “I always say let’s shoot seven shots better on Saturday than I do on Friday, so I’ll take that.”

To the disappointment of many, Sabbatini will not be paired in the third round with Tiger Woods, who is among the three players sitting one stroke back. In the spring of 2007, Sabbatini got Woods’s attention when he said he relished playing against Woods and proclaimed him “as beatable as ever.” Sabbatini’s brashness is as much a personal trademark as his cowboy hats.

“Obviously, it’s great to see him playing well,” Sabbatini said. “There’s a lot of good names on that leaderboard. Ultimately, I’m not worried about what he’s doing or anyone else is doing. I’m focused on myself. Ultimately, it comes down to the challenge inside me, and that’s what I’ve got to focus on.”
