The National Basketball Association fined Bill Laimbeer of the Detroit Pistons and Brad Daugherty of the Cleveland Cavaliers $5,000 each yesterday for fighting during a game last Friday. The players had received one-game suspensions without pay -costing Daugherty $10,000 and Laimbeer $7,300 - and both missed games on Sunday. Wayne Embry, the Cavaliers' general manager, was fined $1,000 for leaving his seat behind the Cleveland bench and charging onto the court during the fight. Daugherty is appealing his fine. ''I was wrong to take a swing at him, but to put me in the same boat as Laimbeer is ludicrous,'' he said.(AP)
