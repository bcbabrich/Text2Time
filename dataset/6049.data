WASHINGTON, June 2—The House, considering a bill to establish a Department of Energy, defeated a major proposal of the Carter Administration by refusing today to give the head of the new department the authority to set natural gas prices.

Republicans, who argued that the move would give one man too much power, voted overwhelmingly In support of an amendment that would put that pricing authority in a new independent Federal commission.

There was no major opposition to the concept of a single department to deal with the nation's energy problems, but the vote on this amendment showed that the House, like the Senate earlier, had reservations about a sweeping grant of power over natural gas pricing, on which the Administration's policy is regarded as unclear.

With a long list of amendments before it, the House could not complete work on the bill tonight, but was expected to pass it tomorrow. It will then go to a conference with the Senate, which adopted a somewhat different price‐setting mechanism.
