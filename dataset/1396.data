PARIS

Only in the spontaneous, high-energy environment of Opening Ceremony, the retail temple dedicated to of-this-moment street style that started on Howard Street in New York nearly a decade ago, does it make any kind of sense that a pair of self-proclaimed mall kids from the suburbs of Los Angeles would wind up at the design helm of a Parisian fashion house.

On Sunday, the founders of the store, Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, both 36, will present their first collection for Kenzo, the label that became a cultural touchstone here in the 1970s when it was founded by Kenzo Takada, a young designer from Japan. Their show is scheduled between those of Hermès and Givenchy.

To give you an idea of how drastically different their approach to French fashion is likely to be, here is what the Kenzo atelier on the Rue Vivienne looked like earlier this week: Mr. Leon and Ms. Lim were sitting in a cramped makeshift office with a large white sculpture of a rabbit peering in at them through an open window. They showed a little animated video that transformed the Kenzo logo into a moving runway with dancing flowers and fireworks. Assistants were showing them samples, saying things like, “Très cute, right?”

With 125 employees at Opening Ceremony, stores in Tokyo and Los Angeles, their own collection, a showroom and fast-moving collaborations with designers around the world, Mr. Leon and Ms. Lim have created the defining retail concept of their generation. They see, they sample, they consume fashion like locusts, they instinctually move on to whatever’s next.

Their surprise appointment at Kenzo — they speak hardly any French; neither had studied fashion when they met as undergraduates at the University of California, Berkeley, in the mid-1990s — represents a new willingness of French fashion to be experimental as well. Rather than putting on a formal runway show, Mr. Leon and Ms. Lim are having a party, with “runway moments” in various rooms of the atelier that have been painted in bright blue or red. The actor Jason Schwartzman is in charge of the music. The designs are meant to be more democratic and less expensive than in Kenzo’s recent past, since it has been under the ownership of the luxury conglomerate LVMH and designed most recently by Antonio Marras.
