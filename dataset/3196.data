To the Editor:

Dennis Baron's reminder of our weak foreign-language knowledge in an era of complex global politics is an eye-opener (''America Doesn't Know What the World Is Saying,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 27). Our enemies have the advantage of conducting their ''business'' in their native language as long as we don't understand.

In most countries, the person with multiple-language skills is considered gifted. When we talk about improving our educational system, it should include foreign languages along with math and science.
