Like many other communities across the region and the nation, this affluent suburban village of 9,000 in northern Westchester County has been struggling for a decade to adapt to an influx of Hispanic immigrants, many of them ill-educated day laborers from impoverished villages in Central America. The Hispanic population here grew from 5 percent in 1980 to about 12 percent in 1990, according to the census.

One question for the courts will be whether the town discriminated against them. In the last three years, the United States Justice Department has sued towns in Illinois, New Jersey and New Mexico, alleging that they violated fair housing laws by using zoning and housing codes to exclude Latin Americans.

In Mount Kisco, the friction between longtime residents, many of Italian and Irish descent, and the Spanish-speaking newcomers has created feelings of loss and anger on both sides, roiling the idyllic surface of this picturesque town.

'We Want Our Town Back'

It was a letter to the editor of The Patent Trader, published in September 1994, that crystallized the anger of many town residents about the presence of the Hispanic immigrants in their midst.

Linda Skiba and Beth Vetare Civitello wrote that they would risk being called prejudiced to draw attention to what they saw as the deterioration of ''the once bucolic Village/Town of Mount Kisco that we have always loved.''

''The overwhelming amount of incidents that involve intoxicated persons should be alerting us to a major problem,'' they wrote. ''Check the police records concerning arrests made involving Hispanics (for lack of a better term); undocumented or legal, either driving while intoxicated or throwing beer bottles or tearing street signs out of the ground or knifing one another.''

In conclusion, they wrote, ''We want our town back!''

At the Sept. 26 meeting of the town's Board of Trustees, Richard T. Roth, a Republican who was then Mayor, read the letter aloud. Residents complained that too many Hispanic men were loitering on street corners, drinking and urinating in public and living in overcrowded housing.
