Mke Heath, the Detroit Tiger catcher, was suspended for two games by the American League yesterday for bumping Umpire John Hirschbeck.

Heath plans to appeal, however, and can continue playing until a hearing is held. This hearing is expected to take place this week in New York, where the Tigers are playing the Yankees.
