"That's the game plan," he said."Basically I think it's pretty clear that people are very dissatisfied with the educational system. They are ready to do something radical. Once their reservations are addressed in a new voucher initiative with the kind of protections people want, I think we've got a winner."

He pointed to a poll by an independent research organization, Policy Analysis for California Education, that found that 63 percent of Californians favor the concept of vouchers.

But, addressing elements that are absent from Proposition 174, the poll found that 87 percent believe that private schools should meet state academic, fiscal and safety requirements; 60 percent believe that they should hire only certified teachers, and 82 percent believe that they should be required to provide additional support for students with special needs.

While opponents campaign against the proposal in these areas of vulnerability, analysts worry about its broader implications in a state that has become increasingly fragmented by cultural and ethnic differences. They say the plan would weaken one of the last remaining institutions that offers a common experience to most Americans.

"If there is any hope of articulating commonalities and common values, it is in the public schools," said Sherry Bebitch-Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate School. "This idea will exacerbate an already Balkanized situation. Already the public schools are far more minority than white and the private schools are more white than minority."

Warren Furutani, a member of the Los Angeles Board of Education, said: "It is clear that the vouchers will benefit those who have the mobility and the additional dollars to go to the private system. Those who are left behind will be relegated to the back seat of society for the rest of their lives."

Critics note that many poor inner city children could not make use of the vouchers because they would not cover the tuition of many private schools. In addition, no provision is made in the measure for school transportation, meaning that poor children might not have access to the better schools.
