To the Editor:

I spent America's Election Day in Chiapas, the southernmost Mexican state, as part of a delegation sent by Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based human rights organization. While California's voters and Gov. Pete Wilson have spent a great deal of time considering the audacity of those who cross our borders illegally, I wonder how much they've pondered what makes these people leave everyone and everything behind?

That became clear to me on Nov. 13, the day I encountered the peasants who had lived on an ejido, a communal farm, called Patricio. Two days earlier, they said, they were violently dislodged from their homes by armed gunmen hired by the wealthier local landowners. These people told of being terrorized for three days by the gunmen until they finally agreed to abandon their farm, if only they would first be allowed to gather their few belongings -- few because their life is one of subsistence farming, where they live in homes with dirt floors, usually without running water or electricity.

They collected their possessions and then, they said, were forced to watch as the landowners' thugs burned them, including the four vehicles they had for 350 people. A child lying inside one of these vehicles was incinerated. Five were shot and wounded. More than 20 men, I was told, were "disappeared" after their heads were shaved and they'd felt the searing pain of a rifle butt in the groin. (One of these men was eventually found dead on another ejido.)

As the rest of the peasants were loaded into buses to be taken away, they said, the gunmen threw gasoline on the vehicles and tried to set them alight. Fortunately, they were unsuccessful, and the screaming occupants escaped with the clothes on their backs.
