Getting a Jump on Dress Season

It isn’t easy to wear conspicuous frills without looking like an attenuated infant, but who isn’t ready for a bit of froth after the endless winter?

The feminine-tough contrast and neutral hues (navy, beige and army green are all good) kept the look stylish and seasonally suitable. Later, she can style up the dress with summer accessories. Here, a couple of girlie options to wear now and into dress season.
