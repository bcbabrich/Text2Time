Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming has been so successful since 1995, Federal officials say, that the first steps toward a single, integrated wolf population in the Northern Rockies have now been taken.

In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward E. Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program. The wilderness of central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults and 60 to 65 pups.

Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and 1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their populations since then.

In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980's.
