After an extraordinary lineup of news specials last night—interviews with Henry A. Kissinger, the late Lyndon B. Johnson and South Vietnam's President Thieu—the Columbia Broadcasting System is tonight turning over its three hours of prime time, from 8 to 11, to Shakespeare's “Much Ado About Nothing.”

Even if neither evening sets a record for audience ratings, both provide splendid illustrations of what commercialTV programing can be at its innovative and imaginative best. It's enough, almost, to give television a good name.

The production of “Much Ado” has been supplied by Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, It began in Central. Parklast summer and is, currently having a successful run an Broadway. The box office is being watched closely to see if the TV production hurts or helps ticket sales.

As wtih many of the feisty Mr. Papp's productions, “Much Ado” has generated its dollops of controversy, its ardent admirers and passionate detractors.
