TELLING

A Memoir of Rape and Recovery.

By Patricia Weaver Francisco.

Cliff Street/HarperCollins, $23.

For many rape survivors, the shame, fear and anger they feel are often followed by silence. For Patricia Weaver Francisco, who was raped in her downtown Minneapolis apartment just before her 30th birthday in 1981, the hush that fell over her was in response to people's reactions. ''Every time I told someone that I had been raped, I caused a small explosion,'' she writes in ''Telling: A Memoir of Rape and Recovery.'' Five years after her attack, Francisco had flashbacks while in labor for 36 hours. She writes that during the moments leading up to the emergency Caesarean section (which saved her baby's life), she felt ''trapped, expected to cooperate, somehow doomed to accept what is happening to me. I've been here before.'' Thirteen years after the attack, the despair returned while Francisco attended the trial of Timothy Baugh, who was charged with raping several women in the same Minneapolis neighborhood where she was attacked. Although Francisco's assailant was never caught, she took comfort in knowing Baugh -- the surrogate'' -- was convicted. Her intimate account of rape's repercussions includes details about the strain it put on her marriage (she and her husband struggled for 13 years before divorcing) and Francisco's decision to tell her young son about her ordeal. Francisco, who teaches creative writing at Hamline University in St. Paul, encourages others to start a dialogue about the ''unspeakable'' crime. Francisco warns against keeping quiet: ''Evil is best borne when it's fully visible.'' Nancy Gavilanes
