The Knicks, who usually win games at home in the fourth quarter, found a way to lose one last night, shooting 23 percent from the field.

While Knicks were missing 20 of 26 shots in the last period, the Golden State Warriors were shooting 70 percent and outscored the Knicks, 134-114, at Madison Square Garden before a capacity crowd of 19,591.

The loss was the Knicks' third in the last six games at the Garden since the Philadelphia 76ers halted their home winning streak at 26 games. The defeat also was the Knicks' worst at home since April 17, 1987, when the Bullets beat them, 142-110. Wilkins Ties Mark

The only good news for the Knicks was Gerald Wilkins, who made six 3-point field goals, tying Trent Tucker's club record set last November against the Pistons. The Knicks attempted 29 3-pointers, the second most in National Basketball Assocation history, and hit 11, equaling a club mark.
