Most of the natural sea salts introduced in the last few years have about the same effect on your food. But texture is a factor and can influence the amount you use. The latest exotic salts are from Asia: Bali, Bangladesh and the Himalayas, from ancient marine deposits left in the foothills.

Two years ago, Ben and Blair Ripple, American entrepreneurs, started Big Tree Farms, a cottage industry in Bali that employs local families to extract sea salt, above, from the black sand beaches. The coarsest of the grains are actually hollow and shaped like pyramids; they have an almost sweet finish. These salts are sold at Dean & DeLuca in 5-ounce boxes for $6.50 and in 10-ounce coconut shells for $14. Kalustyan's has Bay of Bengal sea salt, which is coarse, rustically uneven and a bargain at $8 a pound. Himalania is a sharp-tasting pink salt from the Himalayas, finely milled in France, packed with a wooden spoon in 8.75-ounce boxes and sold at Grace's Marketplace, $11, and Sur la Table, $11.95.
