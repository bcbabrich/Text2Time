SAN MATEO, Calif., Apri1 30 —Albert Lema, the chairman of the Communist party of Northern California, spoke on the campus of the college of San Mateo this morning in spite of vigorous efforts to bar him.

The opposition was led by a new group. The Taxpayers Committee to Oppose Communist Speakers on Campus. Its membership was drawn from the considerable conservative population of San Mateo, a Right‐wing stronghold. The group's leader is the former conservative California Assemblyman, Louis Francis.

Within the last few days the question of Mr. Lema's appearance has become a highly emotional cause in San Mateo.

He was invited to the campus by the students' association of the junior college. Originally he was to have spoken in a hall with a few hundred seats. Because of the excitement generated by the right wing attack on the scheduling, the speech was moved to the men's gymnasium which was filled with upward of 2500 students.
