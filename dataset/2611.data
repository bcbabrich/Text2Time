Even the Adirondacks were no longer lost to me. Although my family hasn't been back to Blue Mountain Lake since we moved to California nearly two years ago, I could relive the sensation of watching the sun set over the lake for $11.95. That's the price adirondackreflections.com charges for a 20-piece assortment box of those little maple sugar candies that I used to let melt in my mouth while I sat on the porch and watched the sky turn red over the mountain.

Just thinking about it, I smelled pine.

Of course, boxed candies are no challenge for the Internet to deliver. Nor are some of the nonperishable Maui specialties that we discovered last week, like peeled sugar cane sticks and jars of onion salsa. Both are available from mauidirect.com, where a three-pack of salsa made from the island's mild, sweet, white onions was $28.25.

But what about the Maui foods I'll miss most?

At Kimuru's Saimin Restaurant in Haiku, we placed our lunch order at the window, then waited impatiently at long wooden picnic tables as the delicious smell of grilled ''wet noodles'' and char sui filled the room. While we waited, we wondered: Had we ordered enough meat sticks? Whose order of noodles was it that we could see being dipped into a vat of hot broth and then hitting the grill with a sizzle? Could the Internet bring back memories of my favorite lunch spot?

I was gratified to learn the answer was yes, in a fashion. At zippys.com, a site operated by a popular chain of Hawaiian-style restaurants, I could buy make-your-own saimin, enabling me to cook the ramenlike soup at home anytime I wanted. An eight-pack of saimin mix was $12.50. Even better, Zippy's sells two-pound packages of char sui (thin slices of sweetly marinated barbecue pork) for $17.

Next door to Kimuru's Saimin Restaurant was the Haiku Grocery Store, where we bought mochi for dessert. The slightly sweetened cubes of rice flour had a chewy, lightly resistant texture -- close your eyes and try to picture edible Play-Doh in the pale pastel hues of food coloring -- and a subtle flavor that hooked us. The first day, we ate the coconut mochi in the car before we got home. The second day, the sweet potato mochi beckoned. The third day, we branched out to butter mochi.

Mochi, a Japanese transplant to Hawaii, seemed like a secret discovery that only we knew about until I went online. There, I discovered mochi world -- zillions of recipes for mochi, advice for flavorings, sources for rice flour, even coconut mochi mix, at islandtrend.com ($6.99 for a 2.5-pound bag and a can of coconut milk).

Mochi is a very personal dessert. The recipe I found that sounded most likely to approximate the coconut mochi we bought at Haiku Grocery Store was one for Baked Chichi Mochi at justgreatrecipes.com, and it recommended the liberal use of food coloring (red). It called for mochiko, a sweet rice flour that www.quickspice.com sells for $1.49 (for a one-pound box).
