In a new world order that is melding Wall Street and Silicon Valley, the business of buying and selling stocks for smaller investors is being shaped as much by lesser-known on-line brokerage firms as it is by the big brand-name firms.

While Charles Schwab & Company and E*Trade have established themselves as the most recognizable on-line names, the fastest-growing firms are Waterhouse Securities, a discount broker turned on-line provider that does relatively little advertising, and Datek Online, a broker that caters to what some in the business call ''hyperactive traders.''

And that, analysts say, is another hint that when it comes to the retail market -- that is, smaller investors -- the shape of things to come may be trickling up from below.

''All the big Wall Street firms are looking at how these companies are shaping on-line trading,'' said Bernard L. Madoff, a member of the Securities Industry Association, which represents many of the big investment houses. ''Nobody at this point can or should ignore it; it's not a passing fancy.''
