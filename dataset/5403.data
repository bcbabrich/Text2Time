''It's so much beyond any expectation,'' said an ebullient Mr. Trump, who had said that he had hoped to just break even or turn a modest profit of about $100,000. ''This is a little different ending than most city stories.''

Mr. Stern agreed that the rink was ''enormously successful.'' Record Admissions

But the Trump Organization still has a lot of negotiating to do with the city if it is to continue to operate the rink. Mr. Gliedman said the two sides are far apart on some key aspects of the proposed concession contract, such as its duration and the fate of the Lasker Rink in Central Park near 103d Street.

The Trump Organization has asked for a 10-year agreement, Mr. Gliedman said, and the city has offered one for 4 years.

Mr. Stern declined yesterday to discuss the negotiations. ''We have a lot of negotiating to do,'' he said.

Mr. Trump took over the project in June 1986 after two city studies had concluded that the renovation was a failure. The city agreed to allow Mr. Trump to take over the project, with both agreeing that all profits would go to public works projects and charities suggested by city officials and approved by Mr. Trump.

The project was completed two and a half months ahead of schedule and cost about $750,000 less than the $3 million that it was budgeted for.

Mr. Stern said the profits came from an unexpectedly high turnout in the winter. He said that about 225,000 people bought the $4.50 admission tickets to the rink as of March 24. Mr. Gliedman said the Trump Organization believes an additional 25,000 people used the rink from March 24 to Monday.
