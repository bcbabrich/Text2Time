Mr. Spitzer, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2006, said the $850 million was the largest settlement with one company since he began investigating corporate wrongdoing three years ago. He has negotiated billions of dollars in penalties and restitution from banks and mutual funds for cheating customers. The largest single payment until now had been $300 million paid by Citigroup, whose analysts were accused of providing misleading advice on stocks.

In the settlement yesterday, Marsh agreed to return about half the $1.7 billion in incentive payments that it said it had received over four years from insurance companies. Mr. Cherkasky did not acknowledge that the incentive payments had increased the cost of insurance, but he said Marsh agreed to the settlement to "put this behind us."

Most of those that will receive restitution, Mr. Cherkasky said, are American businesses, but some overseas companies that bought insurance through Marsh in New York will also be offered restitution.

Mr. Cherkasky's carefully worded apology seemed to be intended to distance the company from further liability. But Mark Geistfeld, a New York University professor who teaches insurance law, said it was not clear that the strategy would succeed.

"The issue is going to be whether they are vicariously liable for the misconduct of their employees," Mr. Geistfeld said. But he added, "The company's argument would be weakened by the fact that the misconduct benefited Marsh and not the individual employees."

Vinay Saqi, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the agreement appeared to be "very manageable" for Marsh.

The stock market seemed to agree. Marsh's shares, which fell sharply after the Spitzer lawsuit, rose $1.41 yesterday to close at $32.50. But that was still well below their price of $46.13 before Mr. Spitzer's lawsuit.
