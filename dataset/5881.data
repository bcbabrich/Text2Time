''Never have I been in such a situation, and I didn't know how to behave myself,'' he said through an interpreter at the Forum's postgame news conference. ''I still think that the best hockey fans live in Montreal. It's difficult to express my feelings. I am very glad they liked how I played, but don't forget I was playing against their team. So that doubles my good feelings about this applause.''

The applause may have been fueled by reports in the local papers quoting him as saying that should Soviet authorities permit him to play in the National Hockey League, he would want to play only for Montreal.

''I would like that because the Canadiens are very much like my team, the Red Army club, in being many times champions,'' he was reported to have said. ''Also, it would be nice to play before such a great crowd. But of course it is up to my coach and the authorities.''

Peter Stastny of the Nordiques disagrees with those who consider Tretiak one of the world's best goalies. Stastny is the 25-year-old former star of the Czechoslovak national team, who defected to Canada with his two brothers. He insists many Europeans share his view.

''A lot of people, especially here in Canada, make a big hero out of him, but he has bad days and good days like any other goalie in Europe,'' said Stastny, who is out with a knee injury. ''The Russians in the past didn't have many good goalies, Tretiak is the best they've had in the past 15 years. But during that time, Europeans will tell you, the Czechs usually had the best goalies in Europe, and the Swedes have had very good ones, too.''
