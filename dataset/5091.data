In three years as president of the University of Maine, Dale W. Lick has heard his share of criticism, but none stronger than that unleashed this week after he said research showed that black athletes perform better than whites because they are better suited genetically for certain sports.

Dr. Lick was asked at a student senate meeting Tuesday why there was a high percentage of minority athletes only in football and basketball at the school. According to a transcript of the conversation, Dr. Lick replied: ''A black athlete can actually outjump a white athlete on the average so they're better at that game. The same is true for football. The muscle structure of the black athlete typically is more suited for certain positions in football and in basketball. Now, this isn't me talking, this is what the research shows.''

Mr. Lick was immediately criticized by students, faculty members, state officials and the chancellor of the state university system. They said the statement was, at the very least, insensitive and showed poor judgment by the head of the state's main campus in Orono. No Derogatory Intention

Mr. Lick, who is 51 years old and has a doctorate in mathematics, said later that he ''certainly didn't mean in any way to be derogatory or discriminatory at all.''
