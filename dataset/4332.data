The Quaker Oats Company said yesterday that it would slash 300 salaried sales jobs in the first step of its restructuring. The food company will close as many as 15 field offices and combine its grocery sales divisions into a single group. More cuts are expected at the company's headquarters in Chicago and its research facility in Barrington, Ill., but that number has not been disclosed. Only field sales for the Gatorade sports drink and food service divisions will remain independent. On May 16, Quaker Oats said it would take a charge of $110 million to $130 million in the fourth quarter, which ended yesterday, to cover restructuring in the next 12 to 15 months. Quaker shares fell $1.125, to $69.75, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
