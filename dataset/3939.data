In the vast drug bazaar that Washington Heights has become, homicide is the leading cause of death for young men. A Federal judge's decision to dismiss charges against a woman caught with a carload of cocaine there is bound to make things even worse.

Around 5 A.M. on April 21, 1995, Officer Richard Carroll saw four young men loading duffel bags into the trunk of a car with Michigan license plates. When Officer Carroll and his partner approached, the men fled. The officers found 75 pounds of cocaine and four pounds of heroin in the bags. The driver, Carol Bayless of Detroit, later confessed that she had made 20 such trips before.

While the size of this transaction was unusual, the things that made Officer Carroll suspicious -- the location, the early hour, the out-of-state plates and the men running away -- surprised no one familiar with the Washington Heights drug trade. No one, that is, except Harold Baer Jr., the Federal judge who found Officer Carroll's explanation "incredible." Judge Baer declared the search illegal and threw out the confession, saying that Mrs. Bayless could just as easily have been an innocent visitor getting help with her luggage.

As for the reason the men fled, Judge Baer had a simple explanation: The police in the neighborhood have a reputation for being corrupt and brutal. "Had the men not run when the cops began to stare at them, it would have been unusual," said the judge, who served on the Mollen Commission, which investigated police corruption.
