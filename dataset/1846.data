By an unusually slim margin of 30 to 20 (with one member absent), the City Council voted on Monday night to call on the State Legislature to adopt congestion pricing for Manhattan south of 60th Street, giving Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his ally, the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, a major victory. As Diane Cardwell notes, the fight now moves to Albany, where the biggest obstacle for the plan may well by Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker. (See related blog post.)

As The Daily News notes, “It was one of the closest votes in recent memory for a Council that usually passes measures by wide margins, but supporters hailed it as a sign of broad support.”

The New York Post reports, “Senate Republicans said they may take up the congestion pricing measure as soon as today, but Mayor Bloomberg’s plan faces significant opposition in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.”

Friend Testifies in Sean Bell Shooting Case

Trent Benefield, who was in the back seat during the fatal shooting, told the court he saw a man standing in front of the car, pointing a pistol at Mr. Bell. Five weeks after three detectives went on trial in the death of Mr. Bell outside a Queens club on Nov. 25, 2006, Mr. Benefield gave the first account from inside the bullet-riddled car. He recalled the last words Mr. Bell, 23, was likely to have heard, those of the front-seat passenger, Mr. Guzman, yelling for him to get out of there.

The Daily News describes Mr. Benefield’s testimony as unhelpful to the prosecution’s case.

In the Village, Alarm Over St. Vincent’s Plans

Preservationists in Greenwich Village fear that the city will sanction St. Vincent Hospital’s plan, which will require the destruction of nine buildings and the construction of two enormous towers. A public hearing by the Landmarks Preservation Commission this morning is expected to be heavily attended.

In a related architectural review, Nicolai Ouroussoff, a critic for The Times, writes, “Sadly, the hospital’s application reflects the pernicious but prevalent notion that any single building that is not a major historical landmark — or stands outside the historical mainstream — is unworthy of our protection.”
