Edward C. Prehn, a professor of education and author of economics textbooks for high-school students, died on Saturday at his home on Staten Island. He was 81 years old.

He died of a heart attack, a friend, Michael Rosenfeld, said.

Dr. Prehn taught at City College, Wagner College and in several Staten Island high schools. He was also a member of the Board of Examiners. He retired in 1972.

His several textbooks included "The Modern Economy in Action" and "Teaching High School Economics."

There are no immediate survivors.
