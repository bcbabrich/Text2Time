Among those results, according to prosecution blood experts, are findings that a bloody glove picked up at Mr. Simpson's house contains a "possible mixture" of his blood and the blood of both victims.

Earlier, prosecutors had said that blood droplets found at the slaying scene contained many blood characteristics also found in samples of Mr. Simpson's blood.

There is also testimony in the transcript that Mr. Simpson, who had a cut on his left hand when arrested, told investigators initially that he did not know how he got the cut, then later said he had apparently injured his hand while in Los Angeles on June 12 and then had re-injured it on the morning of June 13 when, after flying to Chicago overnight, he broke a glass when notified of Mrs. Simpson's death. Dismissed Testimony

The transcript also includes testimony from a woman who said she saw Mr. Simpson speeding away from the crime scene on the night of June 12. Asked by prosecutors whether she had told her story to anyone else, the woman, Jill Shively, mentioned only her mother.

But subsequently prosecutors discovered she been paid $5,000 to discuss her account on a syndicated television program.

The general outlines of Ms. Shively's potentially crucial testimony and subsequent admission were known before release of the transcript. What the transcript provides is an insight into the anger and frustration her admission caused among prosecutors as they pushed for an indictment of Mr. Simpson a few days after the slayings.

She was recalled before the 20 members of the grand jury, and one of the lead prosecutors, Marcia Clark, then told the panel:

"I must ask you to completely disregard the statements given and the testimony given by Jill Shively in this case. I cannot allow her to be part of this case now that she has proven to be untruthful as to any aspect of her statement."
