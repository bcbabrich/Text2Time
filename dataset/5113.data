Sparky Anderson is making progress in his recovery from exhaustion and could return to managing the Detroit Tigers within a week.

''I've talked to the physician in California and he concurs that Sparky has made remarkable progress in the past week,'' Dr. Clarence Livingood, Anderson's personal physician and a Tiger team doctor, said.

Anderson was sent to his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., by Dr. Livingood on May 19. The doctor said no specific date had been set for Anderson's return.(AP)
