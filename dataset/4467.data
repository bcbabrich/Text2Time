Ammirati & Puris in New York has resigned the Schweppes U.S.A. account after nine years, citing a decline in advertising spending and changes in management at the United States parent, Cadbury Beverages.

Ammirati's decision to resign the account, which includes Schweppes ginger ales and mixers and Hires root beer, immediately set off speculation that the agency was hoping to land the account of the Royal Crown Cola Company, headed by John C. Carson, the former president of Cadbury Beverages.

Martin Puris, the president and chief executive of the agency, said Schweppes's ad spending had dwindled recently to about $2.5 million from a peak of about $6.5 million. Mr. Puris said he had not talked to Mr. Carson about Royal Crown. Adweek, the trade publication, had reported that Royal Crown might begin a review of its account, now at Crispin & Porter Advertising in Coral Gables, Fla. Adweek estimated that Royal Crown billings might grow to $8 million to $10 million this year.

Beth Ostendarp, a spokeswoman for Cadbury Beverages in Stamford, Conn., said a replacement for Ammirati was expected in the next 60 days. She added that the company had not decided whether to continue maintaining separate accounts for its Schweppes brands and its Canada Dry U.S.A. brands, which include Canada Dry ginger ales and mixers and Sunkist soft drinks, or consolidate them.
