SATURDAY PUZZLE — Some puzzle constructors are attracted to a marquee phrase as their seed entry and some constructors can’t resist the Scrabbly allure of the rarer letters of the alphabet when selecting a place to start filling their themeless grids. Today, David Phillips shows us what it’s like to fall for the allure of the letter X.

Sure, it’s attractive. And when it has a twin, as in the clothing chain T.J. MAXX? Hard to say no, isn’t it, Mr. Phillips? But is it a store that everyone knows? They are very popular in the northeastern United States, but I don’t know whether they are national or international. Research suggests that the chain has stores in several large cities, but raise your hand if you live in a non-metro area and recognize it as a competitor to Kohl’s.

The entry that caught my eye was HATERS GONNA HATE, a lively way to start off our solving year. I also liked SKIN TIGHT (which comes out of retirement after it’s last New York Times usage in 1953), POWER GRAB, ALL SPICE, AVALANCHE, TAKE A DIVE, RAISINETS (because yum) and LEFT TURN. I was not familiar with NESSES as a synonym for “promontories.”

Clue(s) of the Day for me are “Mass master?” for J.S. BACH and “Input signal?” for CARET (it’s funnier if you’re an editor), followed closely by “Roman leader?” for GRECO.

Let’s check in with Mr. Phillips:

Constructor’s Notes:

When constructing a themeless, one thing I like to do is design my black square arrangement around an interesting entry. If done correctly, I feel this technique can help to squeeze in a few unusual letters, avoid the temptation of a prefab grid, and perhaps even create a unique solve. For this puzzle, T.J. MAXX was the entry of interest. Once I had placed black squares around T.J. MAXX (a few under the X’s and one above the J), the resulting NW and SE sections seemed to want to form stacks. But, placing a black-square finger in columns 5 and 11 meant that what is now 27D would have been either a long entry starting with “J” bordering a stack (would this be fillable, I pondered) or a stumpy 3-/4-letter entry starting with “J” (if I added another black square). Since I didn’t like either of those options and wanted to avoid stacked 11’s in the NE/SW, I opted for 9 stacks all around (with extra 8’s in the NW/SE). Lastly, I tried to place the remaining black squares in such a way to give solvers multiple opportunities to enter each corner. Of the entries in my original submission, Will and Joel liked the NE/SE, but disliked a buildup of proper nouns in the SW and the (non)phrase LEAVE LATE in the NW. After a little more back-and-forth, we settled on the fill you see. Stuff like NESSES and ANAS aren’t that great, but they’re relatively isolated and don’t have too many bad crossings, IMO. As for clues, Will and Joel changed quite a few to bring this puzzle up to Saturday difficulty. [Auto racer Luyendyk] became [Part of “Die Fledermaus”], [Widow’s peak, e.g.] became [Plugs can move it forward], and [Figures in red] became [Red menaces?], etc. Fortunately for my ego, Will/Joel kept one of my favorite original clues — [Still the most?] for STEADIEST — and even felt that a question mark was warranted. At any rate, I hope solvers appreciate the added “crunchiness” in their Saturday puzzle; make sure to thank your tireless editors! =) That’s it from me. I’ll have Ms. Swift lead you to the Sunday puzzle. Happy holidays and happy solving!

Oh, right! That’s my cue!
