The President of a delicately balanced country critical to the United States is killed. His top military officers die with him; so do the Ambassador and the military attache of the United States.

There is at the very least the strong suspicion that they were murdered, and political logic indicates that the murder was committed by the same foreigners who had been threatening the President for years. This month there will be an election to replace him.

Whatever happens in the country will affect the peace of a continent and the conflicting security interests of the United States and the Soviet Union. Altogether it is one of the most dramatic and important episodes taking place in the world.

The American public pays no attention. Journalistically, the death of President Zia of Pakistan and the 29 others who were aboard his plane when it crashed in Pakistani territory on Aug. 27 - and its consequences -would have disappeared except for the persistence of a few reporters like Elaine Sciolino of The New York Times and Lally Weymouth of The Washington Post.
