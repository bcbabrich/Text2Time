Some readers of a certain age may remember the B-52’s “52 Girls,” a danceable recitation that included this trippy line: “Can you name, name, name, name — name them today?”

On the bottom half of the draw, as of today, the names are no longer Nadia, Martina, Patty and Maria. It’s now Agnes, Julia, Victoria, Tamira and Agnieszka.

“These are the girls of the USA/The principal girls of the USA/

Can you name, name, name, name them today?”

These are the girls/women of the USA Open:

*Agnes is Agnes Szavay, an 18-year-old Hungarian ranked a career-high No. 31 and a player we previously profiled on this blog. She defeated No. 7 Nadia Petrova, 6-4, 6-4, and if you read this blog regularly, you knew Petrova had a bum leg (and remains possibly the most talented current player not to win a Grand Slam tournament).

*Julia is Julia Vakulenko, the old woman of the group at 24, who defeated Maria Kirilenko, 6-2, 6-4. Vakulenko, who lives in Barcelona, is ranked No. 50, even though she reached No. 33 in May. She is from the Ukraine, not Russia, as I’d previously written.

*Victoria is Victoria Azarenka, an 18-year-old from Belarus, who now lives in Scottsdale, Ariz. The 41st-ranked player defeated, well, smoked No. 16 Martina Hingis, the 1997 Open champion, 3-6, 6-1, 6-0. Azarenka, who unfortunately is a bit of shrieker when she hits, was the 2005 junior champion.

Tamira is Tamira Paszek, an Austrian and the baby of the bunch at 16. She defeated No. 11 Patty Schnyder, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (1). She is already ranked No. 43 despite her restricted schedule and is coached by Gustavo Kuerten’s old mentor, Larri Passos.

And last but definitely not least is the player who started today’s rash of upsets: Agnieszka Radwanska, an 18-year-old Pole who defeated the defending champion Maria Sharapova, 6-4, 1-6, 6-2. Radwanska is seeded and ranked No. 32.

Let’s not forget No. 6 Anna Chakvetadze of Russia, who advanced to the fourth round by defeating No. 26 Sania Mirza. Chakvetadze is only 20.

So what to make of these newcomers on the bottom half of the draw? “… You can see the new generation coming up,” Hingis, 26, said after her loss. They’re very dangerous. I knew it’s not going to be easy. My mom texted me. She said, ‘Watch out.’ But I was. I was awake.”

But after being asked whether the media had overlooked Agnieszka, Agnes, et al, Hingis being Hingis replied: “This is the first tournament that they ever passed — like for her, it’s the first time she’s in the fourth round of a Grand Slam,” she said of Azarenka. “So you cannot write a story about somebody who’s never won anything.”

And how are you old-timers holding out? “So far we’ve been able to hold them back, but it seems like they’ve improved.”

Yeah.

There was one victory for the old school. Svetlana Kuznetsova, who won the Open in 2004, defeated Anadel Medina Garrigues, 6-3, 6-1. Kuznetsova, the highest remaining seed in the bottom half of the draw, is 22; three years younger than her opponent.
