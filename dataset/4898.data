Samuel Cochran Phillips, an Air Force lieutenant general who directed the Apollo space program through the lunar landing in 1969, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif. He was 68 years old.

General Phillips, who retired from the Air Force in 1975, took over the Apollo program in its infancy in 1964.

''The men and equipment that are Apollo 11 have performed to perfection,'' he said at a news conference after the triumphant liftoff from the moon's surface by the mission commander, Neil A. Armstrong, and his co-pilot, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. ''Perfection is not too strong a word.''

Before the launching of Apollo 10, in May 1969, Dr. Wernher von Braun, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., singled out General Phillips as the man to whom the greatest credit belonged for pulling the many pieces of the program together and making them work.
