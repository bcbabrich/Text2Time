OTTAWA, Oct. 31—An opposition member of the Canadian House of Commons said today that a bugging device had been found in his chair in his parliamentary office by an electronics expert.

The announcement, by Elmer McKay of the Progressive Conservative Party, caused an uproar in the Commons. Other offices in the Parliament buildings were being searched this afternoon for similar devices but none have been reported found.

Mr. McKay's announcement followed the disclosure by Solicitor General Francis Fox, the Cabinet minister in charge of law enforcement, that the security unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been involved in another questionable break‐in besides two such incidents revealed earlier.
