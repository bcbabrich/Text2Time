Ad=vanced Micro Devices Inc., the Intel Corporation and the National Semiconductor Corporation charged today, as expected, that Japanese semiconductor companies are dumping computer memory chips known as Eproms on the United States market.

In a joint petition filed with the Commerce Department and the United States International Trade Commission, the three Silicon Valley companies said that Japanese chip makers were selling Eproms, which provide semi-permanent storage of data in computers, at below manufacturing cost in the United States, a violation of American trade law.

The petition asks the United States Government to impose anti-dumping duties on Eproms from Japan.

According to the petition, Eprom prices fell dramatically below the traditional industry ''curve'' as Japanese producers entered the market and undercut American manufacturers' prices. The petitioners estimated that revenues to United States producers from 128K and 256K Eproms would be reduced by $203 million between July 1985 and July 1986 because of Japanese pricing policies.
