WESTBURY, L. I., June 2 —Carmine Abbatiello is the world's best harness racing driver—according to Car mine Abbatiello.

The 34‐year‐old horseman from Colt's Neck, N. J., where he owns a 45‐acre spread and raises cattle, chickens and standardbreds, will not hesitate to tell any one that “if I had the stock that Billy Haughton, Stanley Dancer, George Sholty and some of the other ‘name’ drivers have, I'd convince everyone of my greatness.”

Most of Abbatiello's col leagues learned long ago that when Carmine “pops off” it is not to be regarded as braggadocio. In fact, the ma jority of reinsmen are quite friendly with him and are most respectful to Carmine, who currently is the leading driver in North America. His older brother, Tony, is also an outstanding driver.

Must Get Rolling Now

The other drivers often are amused by Carmine's self proclaimed superiority and always are happy to be in his company. At the moment, though, Carmine is not alto gether happy with himself. He is behind the schedule he set for himself at the start of the campaign, when he pre dicted:

“This year I will become the first American driver to bring home 400 winners.”

Herve Filion of Angers, Quebec, had 407 winners in 1968.
