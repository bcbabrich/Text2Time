Flower and vegetable displays lined the banquet room at Tavern on the Green and spilled onto a sunny terrace last week, a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.

There were masses of flowers, including New Guinea impatiens in shades of lemon, ivory or pink on deep bronze green; pale pink and deep rose vincas, and geraniums with rose-freckled pink petals.

And there were bouquets of cream, yellow and crimson roses as fragrant as they were beautiful.

The mounds of vegetables included yellow, green and orange squashes, Chinese blue cabbages, purple-on-white Japanese eggplants and yellow canary cherry tomatoes.

Stealing the show on the terrace, though, was a huge basket shaped like a three-leaf clover that overflowed with vegetables prepared for pre-luncheon nibbling.
