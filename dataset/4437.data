Last Friday, Glenn Ganey lived his nightmare. "I was working at a desk when the explosion hit," recounted Mr. Ganey, who works in Dean Witter's data processing department. "Like everyone else, we didn't know what to do, since communications were knocked out and there was no guidance." It took 90 minutes for Mr. Ganey to make it down from the 67th floor.

Mental health professionals, who have already started to provide post-disaster counseling, worry about how long it will take people like Mr. Ganey and thousands like him to recover from the trauma of the explosion.

The American Red Cross and other agencies met over the weekend to develop a plan to make counseling available for the thousands of workers who were trapped and made their way to safety. The New York office of the Red Cross is coordinating efforts by several agencies to help workers at the World Trade Center cope with the psychological aftermath.

"We are aware of the trauma people have experienced and their concerns," said Melvin Reeves, director of disaster services at the Red Cross.
