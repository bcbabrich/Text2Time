The United States has received a private response to American messages sent to Iran, Administration officials said today, and Secretary of State George P. Shultz indicated his willingness to meet with Iran's Foreign Minister if the Iranians asked for such a meeting.

The message from Iran and Mr. Shultz's comments in a television interview suggested an intensification of signals between the two countries in recent days that could create a climate for an improvement in relations.

An Administration official said today that the message from Iran was channeled through a third party that the official declined to identify. ''There's basically no change in their position,'' the official said, referring to the Iranian message. ''It's basically the same as their public position.''

The official said the United States had not responded to the message. Statement by Reagan

The message was received late last week after President Reagan said that the United States was ready to discuss the American hostages in Lebanon if the leaders of Iran were ''willing and ready to talk.'' But the official said that the Iranian message appeared to have been prompted by a communication sent to Iran by the United States welcoming Teheran's acceptance of a United Nations cease-fire resolution.
