To the Editor: Betsy Wade's "Tracing the Trail of Black History" (Practical Traveler, July 14), is an informative and useful article. I would like to bring to your attention a marvelous resource of black history and culture that the article overlooked.

The Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center in Jackson, Miss., houses collections, including an incredible array of quilts, and exhibits depicting black Mississippi's struggles, achievements and experience. The building, built in 1894, was the first public school for black children in Jackson and opened as a museum in 1984. It is situated between the downtown business district, the Capitol and historic, but currently forlorn, Farish Street (once the Sweet Auburn of Jackson). (Smith Robertson, one of Jackson's first black elected officials, served as an alderman during Reconstruction.)

The phone number for Smith Robertson Museum is (601) 960-1457. FREDRIC C. COOPER Columbia, Md.
