An article in The Arts on Tuesday about Logo, MTV Networks' new gay channel, misstated the name of a PBS series that included an episode featuring lesbian parents that PBS chose not to distribute. It is "Postcards From Buster," not "Buster the Bunny." The article also referred incompletely to the name of a popular VH1 show for which Brian Graden, president of Logo and MTV Networks Entertainment, was responsible. It is "Best Week Ever," not just "Best Week."
