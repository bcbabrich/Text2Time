President Obama wrapped up a summit meeting in Washington aimed at preventing nuclear terrorism. But the focus at a final news conference shifted to the U.S. presidential race.

The president said the comments reflected a person who “doesn’t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.”
