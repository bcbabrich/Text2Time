Helionetics Inc., a military contractor based in Irvine. Calif., filed for protection from its creditors today under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.

The electronics and laser development company said that it had been forced to file the petition after its negotiations with the Downey Savings and Loan Association, a major creditor, failed.

The bankruptcy petition names only Helionetics Inc. and not its subsidiaries, the company said.

The company had previously been in Chapter 11 proceedings, but emerged in 1981, when its founder, Bernard B. Katz, attracted noted military figures to the small company's board.

Members included Edward Teller, developer of the hydrogen bomb; William E. Simon, former Treasury Secretary, and retired Navy Adm. Thomas B. Hayward, all of whom have since resigned. Despite the well-known board members, however, the company failed to attract the big military contracts that it was seeking.
