THIS is the time of year when tenants of big new apartment houses who have been reveling in the services of doormen and elevator operators around the clock are likely to wish that they inhabited walkup brownstones where they would carry out their own garbage.

It is the time of year when any attempt on the part of a postman to say more than “Good morning” is suspect and when the delivery boy's smile, which has always seemed so ingenuous, suddenly seems full of guile.

It is, to come right out with it, the approach to the Yuletide season, when all New Yorkers are divided into two camps —those who are wondering whom they had better tip and how much, and those who are wondering if they are going to be tipped and how much.

The most important thing for those in the first camp to remember is never to try to get any advice on the subject from those in the second. No matter how skilfully and subtly the questioning is handled, the one doing the questioning is at a disadvantage.
