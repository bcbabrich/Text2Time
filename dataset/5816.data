The way Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sees it, the only thing wrong with the little teddy bear holding a minature basketball net and wearing a uniform bearing the blue and gold Los Angeles Laker colors, is its name - Kareem Abdul Jabear. The pun, according to Abdul-Jabbar, who receives no royalites from the enterprise, violates his rights to exploit his own name and injures his marketability.

Accordingly, the Laker star has filed suit in Federal court in Los Angeles against North American Bear Inc., the company that markets the Jabear bear. The Laker center, who is seeking unspecified damages as well as an injunction halting sales of the bear, is believed to be the first celebrity to object to being the model for one of the company's line of Very Important Bears. Since Barbara L. Isenberg, a New York designer, started the V.I.B. line, it has included such bears as William Shakesbear, Zsa Zsa Gabear, Douglas Bearbanks, Queen Elizabear and Bjorn Bear. Mrs. Isenberg, who was also named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
