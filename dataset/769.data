VASSALLO--Edward F. Today, my baby cousin Ed Vassallo breathed his last in this world. He fought as a samurai warrior against the leukemia that returned last year, after a wonderful year in remission. I could go on and on about his humor, his heart, his sense of justice and desire for all mankind to be treated equally, his daily missions and video postings from the Rockaways after Hurricane Sandy, his stint on The Sopranos, his membership with the LAByrinth Theater Company, his deep love of all New York sports teams.... an actor, an inspiration to all who met him and worked with him, he will be missed by his friends around the world, and mostly his family. My heart goes out to his wife Chen, his dad John Vassallo, his brother John Vassallo, his dear sister Elena Vassallo Crossman, his mom Carol Vassallo Soderholm, and all the nieces and nephews who deeply adored him. These were my closet cousins growing - up we have wonderful memories.... I will miss you very much Eddie Freddie.... xoxo see you on the other side. Lee Robin
