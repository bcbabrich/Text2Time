To the Sports Editor:

Tom Durkin's article about Saratoga Race Track (''From So Old to So Valuable,'' The Times, July 25) was interesting and informative, but it contained one inaccuracy. Durkin states that the horses are still ''saddled under the trees,'' much as they were when Ulysses S. Grant lived nearby. Sad to say, this is not true.

For most of this century, the horses were saddled in the beautiful open area behind the grandstand where the trees were numbered 1 to 14. Each horse was saddled beneath the tree that matched its saddlecloth number. Since there was no barrier, the racegoer could view the horse, the trainer and the preparations from reasonable proximity, and this greatly enhanced the race-track experience. It was a wonderful feature that made Saratoga distinctive. This practice was discontinued about 10 years ago.

Now, as at most other tracks, the horses are saddled in a paddock, and the average patron is kept at a distance.

Durkin might also find it interesting to check out the scene behind the grandstand nowadays. No saddling of horses, but a formidable mob, with picnic tables, blankets and towels, beer coolers and pizza, noisy youngsters running about and many of the adults wearing beach attire and rubber sandals.
