Skimming the magazine, I was upset to discover that Anna Quindlen, one of my dear colleagues in schmoozing and opinionating, had been pronounced a treasure of New York.

"Anna Quindlen must feel rotten about turning up on a treasure list so tacky it doesn't even include the Empire State Building," I told my wife. "I ought to phone and tell her not to cry. It could happen to anybody."

My wife pointed out that though the list omitted the Empire State Building, it included Balducci's, a victuals retailer in Greenwich Village. While she didn't want to speak for Anna Quindlen, she went on, she would personally consider it a nice compliment to be declared as valuable to New York civilization as Balducci's.

I would have let the matter rest there if I hadn't bumped into David Halberstam at the opera. The world, of course, knows him as author, raconteur and investigative journalist, but I have known him, man and boy, as a friend. Or so I thought. I have often said, "David Halberstam is a man I can go to the well with."

Now, studying this magazine in which Halberstam, having been asked to name a New York treasure, had named Jules Feiffer, I told my wife, "And I always thought David Halberstam was a man I could go to the well with."

"Nobody goes to the well these days, except maybe in India," she said.

"Well, let me put it this way," said I, suppressing a snarl. "I thought he was a man I could go up in an elevator with."

"Instead of sulking because you didn't get labeled 'Treasure,' " she suggested, "why don't you go up to Lincoln Center and catch the intermission of the opera? You know David never misses a night at the opera. You can tell him how you feel."
