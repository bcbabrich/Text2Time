John Derian’s second home in Provincetown, Mass. — built for a local sea captain in 1789 and purchased by Derian, the interior designer and home goods retailer, in 2007 — can resemble, at times, a particularly thoughtful cabinet of curiosities. A 19th-century flower drying rack from Denmark now displays Derian’s shirts and jackets; silvery, lightly faded midcentury wallpaper hangs in a sitting room near one of the house’s five working fireplaces, the mantel of which is clustered with shells and rocks collected from the surrounding landscape. Large, oil paintings of a dog and a cat, acquired at a flea market in Paris, add whimsy to the kitchen; a copy of Rembrandt’s portrait of his mother, purchased at a Wellfleet flea market, hangs nearby.

It is, throughout, a home of unexpected contrasts. Derian’s handsome, 18th-century dining table, for example, can be swiftly outfitted for Ping-Pong with the addition of a vintage net. A room featuring a purple paint-splattered “Cape Cod floor” — inspired by a Victorian-era method of creating a textured faux finish — is offset by a low, elegant white sofa, designed by Derian and outfitted with vibrant Jeanette Farrier textiles made from vintage Indian saris.
