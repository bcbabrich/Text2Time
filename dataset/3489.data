THE Fourth of July isn't only about fireworks. It's about relaxing with a vengeance, and this year there is a bevy of new accouterments to make that pursuit all the easier. Good news for day-trippers: a new Igloo cooler that plugs into a car cigarette lighter and needs no ice or ice packs. It's $119 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street).

1. A candle lantern in the shape of a golden metal sun ($50) hangs on a crook that can be stuck in the lawn. A tin-roofed glass house lantern, $60, comes with a floor stand, to use inside or outside. Both are at Pier 1 Imports; (800) 447-4371 for stores.

2. An umbrella made of waxed cotton and bamboo, six feet in diameter, is $200 at Portico Bed and Bath in Bridgehampton, N.Y., (516) 537-1449.

3. Old Glory woven into an American-made cotton hammock is available for $160 at William-Wayne & Company, 846 Lexington Avenue (64th Street).
