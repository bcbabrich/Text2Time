If this centuries-old Latin American tradition both marks a young girl's passage into womanhood and celebrates her innocence, it also highlights the powerful role that age-old rituals play in modern American society. The quinceanera, celebrated wherever Hispanic families live, is as much a family statement, a reaffirmation of its cultural identity and its unity in a new world as it is an overblown birthday party.

It also underscores a struggle of the Roman Catholic Church, which is intent on maintaining a foothold among young Hispanics, who are increasingly wary of religion.

The tradition makes a teen-age girl face contradictions in her life. She is at an age when beer parties may seem more attractive than dancing a waltz with her father (a quinceanera tradition). Reaffirming baptismal vows and making a commitment to chastity might compete with the pressures faced by any young woman: boyfriends, having a baby, drugs or, in some neighborhoods, joining a gang.

Yet, the quince, as it is called here, endures. In Houston, where more than 30 percent of the population is Hispanic, priests say there are more quinceanera blessings than weddings. And there is marketing to match. Some shops focus entirely on outfits, and families fall into debt to pay for a celebration that can cost $50,000. Critical of the extravagance of quinceanera parties and of the widespread tendency to ignore the religious part of the tradition, the Catholic Church now promulgates guidelines through its dioceses but leaves it to each parish to adapt the guidelines to tradition. In Texas, some parishes perform quinceanera blessings by the dozens with no requirements, while others require lengthy religious preparations and still others refuse to do them altogether. Some families shop around to find a priest willing to perform a ceremony for a daughter unwilling to have religious training.

"We're trying to make sure the religious significance is maintained," said the Rev. Frank Rossi, chancellor of the Galveston-Houston Diocese. "With the church blessing comes the expectations of Christian living."
