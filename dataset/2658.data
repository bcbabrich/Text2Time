Activities / Procedures:

DAY ONE: UNDERSTANDING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class: “How are the President and Vice President of the United States elected? Jot down everything that you know about the process.” Allow students a few minutes to write, and then have them share their responses briefly with the class. Depending on the level of the class, students’ responses may range in understanding from popular votes to explaining the electoral college system. If students are unfamiliar with the electoral college, be sure to define it. Discuss the following as a class: What do students know about the relationship between popular votes and electoral votes? How did this topic come up in the 2000 presidential election? What might be some of the benefits of the electoral college? Why might some perceive it as unfair? What is a battleground (or swing) state, and how are they related to the electoral college and the candidates’ campaigns?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Focus Narrowing as Close Contest Nears Finish Line” (found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20041101monday.html), using the following questions:

a. How many states does the article refer to as “hard-fought”? What does this mean?

b. What have the candidates done to campaign in these pivotal states?

c. How many electoral votes are needed for a presidential candidate to win the election?

d. How many electoral votes does each of the battleground states mentioned in the article have?

e. Why might Ohio be considered a particularly important battleground state, according to the article?

f. What might pose a threat to John Kerry’s candidacy in Minnesota, according to the article?

g. How might the 2004 election prove to be more of a legal controversy than the 2000 election, according to the article?

3. Explain to students they will be working in groups to create parts of a class-wide pamphlet about the United States presidential and vice presidential electoral process to inform students their age who might not be familiar with the electoral college system. Divide the class into four groups, and assign each one of the following topics to cover in the pamphlet (written on the board or copied on a handout for easier student access):

GROUP ONE: HOW THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WORKS This group explains the difference between popular votes and electoral votes, how electors are allotted to each state, how electors are appointed, and how and when electors cast their votes.

GROUP TWO: HISTORY OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group examines the electoral college’s origins, how the electoral process differs from the Constitutional Convention’s 1787 plan; Article II, Section I of the Constitution; the 12th and 23rd Amendments to the Constitution; and disputed elections throughout history.

GROUP THREE: THE DEBATE OVER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group addresses the controversy of the “winner take all” system, arguments to abolish the college, as well as arguments to defend the system.

GROUP FOUR: THE FUTURE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE This group investigates proposals to reform the electoral college, including direct elections, proportional representation, and the “national bonus plan,” and the likelihood for abolition of or alteration to the system in the future.

Using all available classroom resources, groups research their pamphlet topics. Students should be sure to make note of the bibliographical information of the sources they use. Once groups have completed their research, each group should type its section of the pamphlet in a predetermined font and font size. Each group’s section should take up approximately one column of a tri-fold pamphlet. Create the class pamphlet by folding a paper into thirds. The front of the pamphlet may be designed by a student. The next four columns should include the four groups’ works. The final column should provide bibliographical information. Completed pamphlets should be copied and distributed in a future class. (They may also be made available to other students.)

4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Each student should view The New York Times 2004 Election Guide Interactive Graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/), which allows one to view a voter map of the United States geographically, by number of electoral votes, and by battleground status. (If home Internet access is not available, the maps may be printed out and distributed to students). Using the information from the maps, each student creates a chart listing the states deemed battleground states in the left column, with the other columns detailing the number of electoral votes each state receives, its current status as leaning toward one of the bipartisan candidates or as an unclear or swing state, and the party for which state voted in the 2000 election. Then, each student should write a journal entry analyzing how the information on these maps might be used to predict the outcome of the election.

DAY TWO: BATTLEGROUND STATES AND PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, create the chart assigned for homework on the board and fill in only the names of the twelve battleground states (Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Leave the columns under the headings “Number of Electoral Votes,” “Current Status,” and “Party Voted for in 2000 Election” blank. When students enter class, assign each a blank to fill in on the chart using the data they compiled for homework. Once the classroom board chart is complete, have students compare it to their homework charts for discrepancies, and then discuss their responses to the homework journal assignement.

2. Divide class into six groups, and assign each group two battleground states and their corresponding New York Times articles:

Arkansas

Colorado

Florida

Iowa

Michigan

Minnesota

Nevada

New Hampshire

New Mexico

Ohio

Pennsylvania

Wisconsin



Each group should read and discuss each of its two articles aloud and answer the following questions after reading each article (written on the board for easier student access):

-What makes this a “battleground state” in the 2004 election?

-What is this state’s particular political history or tradition?

-What information provided in this article might provide a clue to which candidate might receive this state’s electoral votes?

-Based on the predictors in the article, how do you think this state will vote on November 2, 2004?

After groups have read their assigned articles and answered the questions on each state, the class should reconvene to fill in a final column added onto the battleground states chart on the board titled “Prediction.” Each group should provide their prediction with a brief explanation. Based on the groups’ predictions for the twelve battleground states and the Interactive Graphic maps’ predictions for the other 38 states, whom does the class predict will be the winner of the November 2, 2004 election?

3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students should follow the televised election coverage and evaluate whether the predictions for their assigned battleground states were accurate. In their journals, students should analyze why their predictions were right or wrong, as well as their reactions to the election results.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-In your opinion, should the electoral college system be preserved, abolished, or changed? Why?

-How did the 2000 election change the way Americans view the electoral system?

-Do you think the Osama bin Laden tape mentioned in the article will have an impact on the election? If so, how? If not, why not?

-Why do you think so many of the so-called “swing” states are in the Midwest?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on journal responses, contributions to the class electoral college pamphlet, participation in group discussions, well-informed battleground state and election predictions, and thoughtful response to the outcome of the 2004 election.

Vocabulary:

intensity, tinglingly, deployed, stump, furor, trending, conservatism, wooing, troika, third-party, hairbreadth, treacherous

Extension Activities:

1. In the 2004 Election Guide interactive graphic (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/politics/2004_ELECTIONGUIDE_GRAPHIC/), The New York Times addresses the “Nader Factor,” or those states where Independent and Reform parties candidate Ralph Nader has been included on or blocked from the ballot. Research the controversy and litigation around Mr. Nader’s candidacy, and write an article for your school’s newspaper about his role in the race for the White House.

2. On November 6, 2001, U.S. Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) introduced three new pieces of electoral reform legislation to the House of Representatives. Investigate these bills and create a chart tracing the progress of each from its introduction to the present time. Then, offer your opinion about each of these bills.

3. With terms such as “battleground” and “the ground war” as examples from the American political vocabulary, brainstorm as many war metaphors as you can. Compile the list into glossary of war metaphors (which can be expanded upon using different themes, such as sports or nature) with definitions and examples of usage for each.

4. Using the 2000 election as an example, create mock television news coverage for the other instances in United States history in which the electoral college votes differed from the popular votes. Had television existed in those times, what issues or controversies surrounding the elections of 1824, 1876 and 1888 would have made the news?

5. During election week, read The New York Times every day and analyze its balance of coverage of the candidates. Alternately, create a headline timeline of articles related to a specific theme, such as a specific candidate, candidates’ views of one another, key issues, voting trends or personal reactions to the election. (To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.)

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics- How much did each candidate in the 2004 election spend on his campaign? Research and chart the campaign finances of the bipartisan and third party candidates.

Global Studies- Research the electoral systems of Australia, Great Britain and Canada. Explain and compare each to the United States electoral college in a creative presentation to your class.

Mathematics- The article read in class mentions the “limitless ways” the two main candidates could reach the “magic number” of 270 electoral votes. Based on the research conducted in class, create ten different mathematical combinations that would result in victory for each candidate.
