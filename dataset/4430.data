Throughout the two years that his country was collapsing into anarchy, Hussein Hassan Awale stood guard at the central police station here. While looters stripped everything they could from the neighboring buildings, Mr. Awale lived here, preserving the station's courtyard and terraces from ruin.

Today, as Lieut. Gen. Robert B. Johnston of the Marines, commander of the United States-led forces here, announced the withdrawal of 2,700 troops over the next 10 days, American officials worked on handing over the job of policing Somalia to Somalis. The Forces' Broader Role

"I'm very happy," Mr. Awale said. "It's a kind of rehabilitation for the country, and for me, too."

Underscoring the United States role in rebuilding the police force, which will not carry weapons initially, former police officials announced the revival at the compound of the United States envoy here, Robert B. Oakley. The force will be paid in food and cash, with logistical support from United Nations workers and advice and firepower from by the multinational military force, said Col. Richard Mentemayer of the Air Force.
