Beacon Wax, Glisade Fabric Finish, Glis Spray Starch and Down ‐ the ‐ Drain are leaving the house of Doyle Dane Bern bach to join Jato and a whole bunch of Lysol products at SSC&B.

All the brands are house hold products of the Lehn & Fink Products Company, which is consolidating them following its “mutually agreed” termination with D.D.B. The relationship had lasted two years. L. & F., a division of Sterling Drug, has three other agencies, War wick & Legler; Gaynor & Ducas and Berta, Grant, Winkler.
