Very few golf strokes scare touring pros, quite a few scare the rest of us, and one scares everyone.

The frightening stroke in question would be the slice putt, the dreaded slider, the one that is forced by the contours of the green to move from left to right for right-handers and from right to left for lefties. The slippery slope of putting, the slider comes in different lengths, rolls uphill or down, goes by several names and has been called many unprintable things.

Sliders have ruined more rounds, shortened more careers and left more mental scars than all the snap-hooks, cold-tops, whiffs, slices and shanks combined.

“As a general rule, handicap golfers hardly ever make the left-to-righter,” said Dave Pelz, a short-game guru who has spent 30 years gathering data on every imaginable sort of pitch, chip and putt.

“There’s a dramatic difference between the number of right-to-left putts made versus left-to-righters,” he said, speaking from the perspective of a golfer who putts right-handed. “At a distance of 10 to 12 feet from the hole, handicap golfers miss three to four times as many left-to-righters as they do right-to-lefters.”

With so much room for improvement in a part of the game that requires perhaps the least athleticism, one would reasonably assume the fix would be easy and available. One would also be wrong, because logic rarely applies to the most counterintuitive of sports.

Two researchers in the early 1990s thought they had found the solution to this putting puzzle. Tim Holman and Ed Stack, golf enthusiasts and standout basketball players at San Jose State, were frustrated with their inability to make sliders with any regularity, so they set about finding answers.

Their premise turned into a study, which turned into a manuscript for their self-published book, “The Art and Science of Switchputting,” a treatise — radical for the time — on why right-handed golfers who had trouble with sliders needed to learn to putt them left-handed.

They gave a copy to Wally Goodwin, who was the Stanford University golf coach. Goodwin asked Holman and Stack to administer their test to his 1993 team, which included the three-time all-American Notah Begay. None of them were surprised by the results: four of the top five players made 14 percent fewer left-to-right-breaking putts than right-to-lefters.

“Wally brought Ed and me in and told us, ‘I’ve been watching my players miss that left-to-right putt for years,’ ” Holman said. “Nobody ever reads enough break into that putt to start with; then they leave the face open and block it, and it’s heading south with no chance of ever getting close.”

Ten years earlier, Holman and Stack had persuaded the former PGA Tour regular and current NBC commentator Roger Maltbie to try their switch-putting method, with some success but with little fanfare. After the Stanford test, they made a believer of Begay, who putted from both sides of the ball as a professional starting in his Nike Tour season of 1998 and during his 11-year PGA Tour career, which has been interrupted by serious back injuries.

“I think there’s an inherent advantage to switch-putting,” said Begay, 38, who used the method exclusively while winning four Tour events in 11 months in the 1999 and 2000 seasons. “But I think inside 15 feet is probably the maximum distance you want to go with it. Once you get outside 15 feet, then speed becomes the focal point over line. When it comes to lag putting, I find it loses some of its advantage.”

So what does this mean for amateurs? Short of taking Sam Snead’s legendary advice to “take two weeks off and quit,” or going through the difficult process of learning to switch-putt from the other side of the ball, there is hope for amateurs seeking to overcome the pitfalls of the left-to-righter.

Brad Faxon, one of the three best putters of the last 30 years, likes to keep it simple. He rolls his eyes about all the hypertechnical advice being ladled out these days, saying: “I think the science of putting is hurting a lot of tour players. I think this having to do it one way — have to have a perfect setup, have to be square — I think it ruins a lot of guys.”

His advice?

“Most of the guys don’t aim it at the right place and don’t start it at the right place,” he said. “When you putt a breaking putt, make sure you don’t start it on the wrong line. For practice, putt it with a tee to aim at. Put an object just left of your line so that if you pull it, you’ll hit that.

“That’s probably as technical as I’ve gotten.”

The short-game expert Stan Utley, who has a long list of students among tour players and a growing one among amateurs, says it is a matter of training one’s roving eyes.

“Anytime a player is hitting a breaking putt, it’s easy for their eyes to veer toward the hole,” Utley said. “Their last look really needs to be on the start line. What I’ll do with some students is, after they’re lined up far enough to the left and before they take their last look, I’ll step right in front of them where they can’t see the hole and tell them, ‘Now hit the putt where your putter’s aimed.’

“All of a sudden, they don’t hit a push-cut-block to the right. They hit it like any other putt.”

Ah, yes. The push-cut-block to the right, a chain of bad events that starts when the player’s head moves, an open putter ensues and the blade cuts across the ball and sends it low and off line. As ugly as that sounds, and as horrid as it looks, it is not an affliction limited solely to weekend hackers or high handicappers. Quite possibly the single most gruesome example of this butchered stroke occurred in 1970 at the British Open at St. Andrews, when Doug Sanders had a 4-foot left-to-right putt to win his first major championship.

Sanders, whose colorful career included 20 victories — but no majors — can still be seen in the mind’s eye as he opens the putter blade and misses the hole entirely. Shocked, he starts to reach over with his putter to drag the ball back for a redo before, mercifully, remembering where he is.

Sanders lost a playoff the next day to Jack Nicklaus, who, fittingly, made a 5-foot downhill slider to close out his one-stroke victory.

Nicklaus and Tiger Woods come to mind as the two golfers in the modern era who have shown almost no weakness when it comes to making the crucial, pressure-packed, hard-sliding left-to-righter.

Nicklaus, however, acknowledged for this article that he found nothing at all easy about the putt most find more difficult than any other.

“Anytime you are going against the grain of what you are doing, it becomes more difficult,” he said. “You are making a right-handed swing, it opens and shuts, and that would be a swing of right to left. If you have a right-to-left swing and the ball is going the other way, it’s a harder combination.

“I would think any golfer would agree that it’s always been the case.”

Nicklaus should know. In 1990, at the United States Senior Open at Ridgewood Country Club in New Jersey, he needed a 5-foot slider to save par at the 71st hole and keep alive his chances of catching Lee Trevino, who was watching from the television tower with a one-stroke lead.

As Nicklaus was over the putt, Trevino said, “Jack sometimes peeks on these short left-to-righters,” which is just what the Golden Bear did, coming out of the putt just enough to make it lip out. Another slider missed.
