The off season lasted about 36 hours for the San Francisco 49ers' coach, GEORGE SEIFERT, who was faced yesterday with the prospect of losing players from his championship team. Six players -- offensive tackle HARRY BOATSWAIN, safety DANA HALL, fullback MARC LOGAN, tight end TED POPSON, running back ADAM WALKER and defensive end MARK THOMAS -- were left unprotected yesterday for the Feb. 15 expansion draft and could be with Jacksonville or Carolina next season. Also, DEION SANDERS and RICKY WATTERS are free agents, and Seifert said the process of trying to re-sign them will begin soon. (AP)
