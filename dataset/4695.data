Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has stumped the state and urged residents in radio ads to elect a State Legislature on Tuesday that would be packed to the rafters with third-party candidates from Mr. Weicker's own independent Connecticut Party.

But there's a significant caveat: Most of the candidates that his party has endorsed and that will appear on its ballot line, which reads "A Connecticut Party," are not members of the party at all. Many say that if they win, they won't owe the Governor anything.

So the question is, what's going on here?

Is Mr. Weicker really building a permanent third party in Connecticut? Is he just endorsing candidates who may or may not need his help? Or is he really doing no more than building support for himself? Politics as Usual, He Says

Mr. Weicker, for his part, has said he is only keeping promises. Mostly, he has endorsed candidates who supported him last year in his efforts to impose an income tax.
