It was just one line in an otherwise unremarkable meeting on Monday, but it surprised the officials in the room: Secretary of State Warren Christopher suggested that the West should begin to think about a Russia without Boris N. Yeltsin.

Mr. Christopher's declaration came in response to a question by Italy's Foreign Minister, Susanna Agnelli, who expressed concern about the Russian President's leadership. She bluntly asked Mr. Christopher whether the West should "go on supporting" him, according to participants in the meeting.

"Perhaps the world should be looking for an alternative," a senior Italian official paraphrased Mr. Christopher as saying.

Ms. Agnelli declined in an interview to characterize Mr. Christopher's thinking on the sensitive subject. But she said that the time has come to look beyond Mr. Yeltsin.
