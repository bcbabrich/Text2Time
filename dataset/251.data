The middle-aged woman looked out into the crowded emergency room. Sherry could barely remember driving herself to the hospital. She couldn’t remember at all how she got from her car to the door of the E.R. She couldn’t remember the nurses taking her blood pressure or placing the IV into the permanent port that had been inserted under the skin of her chest for the blood transfusions she had needed for years. But she knew all of this must have happened because she was watching the dark red liquid drip from the bag, down the tubing into the needle that disappeared into her chest.



It scared her. Not the blood transfusion — she had dozens of them over these past 18 years. She was scared by the degree of impairment she must have had while driving here. When her blood count got really low, she couldn’t think straight; she knew this about herself. And yet she had driven the 12 miles from her home in suburban Austin to this hospital in a condition she now knew was unsafe. She had been behind the wheel when she was severely impaired. Not by drugs or alcohol, but by a brain starved of sufficient blood. Sherry knew she would have been angry if her children had driven in a similar state. She felt embarrassed and ashamed of her own recklessness.

She watched the second unit of blood ease into her system. She felt like every drop helped her feel just a little stronger, think just a little more clearly. When the transfusion was done, she was eager to go. They checked her blood to make certain it was at a safe level and, when reassured, discharged her.

When she got home, she told her husband and teenage children what had happened. “Never let me do that again,” she begged them. If they saw her with the car keys in her hands, they needed to talk to her to make sure she was making sense. If she wasn’t able to carry on a conversation, she was sure she shouldn’t be allowed to drive. Why didn’t you ask for a ride? her older daughter asked. We were all here. Sherry felt her face redden. I guess I was too impaired to know how impaired I was, she confessed.

A Long History of Deficiency

Sherry had been anemic for most of her life. When she was very young, her mother told her, her doctor had put her on iron drops. In middle school, another doctor had put her on iron pills. And she took them — even though they made her constipated and hurt her stomach. When she was in her 20s, she was again put on iron pills. But through all this, she felt fine. She finished high school, started college, finished nursing school and married. She had two kids. Sure, she was tired some of the time. But not, she thought, more tired than other women who had husbands, careers and kids.

But then in 2001, when she was pregnant with her third child, Sherry’s OB got worried. She was, he told her, very anemic. Pregnant woman often have blood levels that look anemic but aren’t. That’s because blood counts are determined by the number of red blood cells per amount of fluid in our arteries. And in pregnancy, there’s a lot more fluid in the circulation, and so the blood is more dilute. A normal blood level, or hemoglobin, for a woman is 12 grams of red blood cells per each liter of fluid. For pregnant women, the “normal” level drops to between 10 and 11. Sherry’s hemoglobin level, she was told, was less than 8. Because blood is essential for fetal growth and development, the obstetrician insisted that Sherry have a transfusion — her first. That one infusion of red blood cells got Sherry through her pregnancy, but it seemed that after that she was constantly anemic. She took iron pills three times a day for as many days as she could manage. But even with that, her hemoglobin level was usually between 9 and 10 and her iron was often barely detectable.

Precious Metal

For the next several years, Sherry worked hard to keep taking her iron, but every year she seemed to be losing ground. No matter how much iron she took, she could feel herself getting more and more tired. She started to crave ice — a strange but common symptom in those who don’t have enough iron to make the blood they need. And despite her best efforts, when her iron levels were measured, they were always low.

Her gynecologist thought it was the heavy menstrual flow she developed after the birth of her last baby and recommended a procedure to permanently remove the lining of the uterus that causes the monthly bleed. She had that done and it stopped her bleeding, but it didn’t keep her from being anemic.

A Shot in the Arm

Her doctor then suggested that she try getting her iron supplements intravenously rather than taking it as a pill. After the first treatment, Sherry felt energetic. Her fatigue disappeared. She felt great. But it didn’t last. Whenever she found herself carrying around cups of ice again, she would call her doctor. Her blood counts continued to measure low, sometimes dangerously so. She started seeing a blood specialist, a hematologist, who put her on a monthly dose of intravenous iron.

Her hematologist noted that sometimes Sherry’s blood count would drop suddenly. One report showed Sherry’s count drop from 7.1 to 6.4 overnight. There aren’t many medical problems that could cause such a drop. A significant episode of bleeding might do that. But Sherry said she hadn’t noticed any blood loss. She did notice an episode of dark urine over the weekend while camping with her family. Her hematologist suspected that maybe her last transfusion had caused a reaction leading her immune system to destroy the new blood. That kind of destruction could cause a loss of blood and its constituent iron as the recycling systems would be flooded and overwhelmed. He looked for evidence of red blood cell destruction. He didn’t find it.

Still, what else could cause her blood counts to drop this way? He started her on high-dose steroids. If her anemia were caused by her own immune system, the steroids, which suppress that system, would help. Remarkably, her blood counts stabilized almost immediately. She had required six units of blood early in the month to get her hemoglobin above 7. Two weeks after starting the steroids, her blood counts remained high — for her. And they stayed that way for several months. To Sherry’s hematologist, this suggested that her anemia was caused by her immune system interfering with either some process in the way blood was made or possibly destroying the blood itself. He couldn’t find direct evidence of either, but the fact that the steroids helped supported his hypothesis.

Steroid medications, like prednisone or dexamethasone — which is what this patient was on — are powerful immune-suppressing medications. They can also cause terrible side effects. Infections are more common because these drugs are so effective at suppressing the system dedicated to fighting them off. Steroids can also damage the tough lining of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. They can damage joints. They make healing more difficult. And they made Sherry’s stomach hurt. Because of all these potential harms, the hematologist wanted to find a medication to replace the dexamethasone. He tried infusing antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) from other people’s systems — a drug called IVIG, short for intravenous immunoglobulins. That seemed to work, but whenever he tried to reduce or eliminate the dexamethasone, her blood count and iron level would plummet. You can see some of the early notes from the hematologist below.

When her hematologist left the practice, she switched to his partner. He tried adding a different, less dangerous immune-suppressing medication called Rituxan. But again, when he tried to get rid of the dexamethasone, or even just lower the dose, her need for blood and iron would lurch upward. How could she get the benefits of the steroids without the risk? He adjusted the doses — could he increase the IVIG and rituximab and just keep her on a very low dose of dexamethasone? These frequent transfusions — nearly one a month — and biweekly infusions of iron carried their own risks. When the Rituxan didn’t help, the decision was made to remove Sherry’s spleen. Removing this organ, basically a very large lymph node, has been shown to be helpful in treating autoimmune disorders of the blood. The thinking is that the spleen traps the red blood cells that have been targeted by the rogue antibodies. Once trapped there, the red blood cells are destroyed. Although no one had ever found any evidence that Sherry had an autoimmune disorder, it was the most likely cause of her chronic anemia. The splenectomy was a bigger operation than expected, but once Sherry recovered, the frequency of her blood transfusions dropped from twice a month to once a month and then to twice a year or less. To see the note about splenectomy, see below.

A Terrible Complication

After two and a half years of high-dose steroids, Sherry’s body gave the signal that she’d had enough. She developed an ulcer in her stomach, which, over time, ate its way through the full thickness of the muscle, causing a rupture. Her stomach’s contents and all its acid were splattered throughout her abdomen. She was on vacation with her family in New Orleans. They’d been walking around the beautiful old city all morning and her kids wanted to go to the zoo. She had been having trouble with her back for most of the holiday and said she’d go back to the hotel and rest while her husband took them to see the animals. When they got back they found her pale, sweaty and doubled over in pain. She initially diagnosed herself with a kidney stone but when the pain worsened, she allowed her son to call 911. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where the perforation was closed. She required several more surgeries that year to fully repair the damage done.

For the past several years, Sherry’s doctors have been trying to manage her anemia with IVIG alone. Because iron can build up in the body, causing organ damage, the doctors have been relying more on blood transfusion. They follow her blood counts and iron levels closely and replete only when necessary. As it has throughout her life, Sherry’s disease seems to wax and wane. She needed only occasional blood or iron from 2013 until 2016. In 2017, she got blood about every other month and iron only three times. This year it has been about the same.

A Slew of Testing

Throughout all this, her doctors have been searching for a cause of Sherry’s persistent iron deficiency anemia. She has been tested for evidence of red blood cell destruction, or hemolysis. None has been found. They continue to suspect an autoimmune process, though again, none of the tests have shown any signs of an immune system gone wild. She has been tested for a rare disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria — an acquired abnormality in the red blood cell itself that causes the (normal) immune system to mistake the cells for invaders and try to destroy them. Only a minority of patients with this disease have the characteristic red urine seen first thing in the morning that gave the disease its name. She has had five colonoscopies and several upper endoscopies to look, unsuccessfully, for a loss of blood there. Three bone-marrow biopsies have shown good production of red blood cells. Results from a few of these study results can be seen here along with her hematologist’s most recent note.

She has seen several of the doctors in a large practice specializing in disorders of the blood. A couple of them have wondered if she causes the drops in her blood counts intentionally. One doctor, Sherry tells me, even asked his nurses to examine her body for signs that she was bleeding herself. They didn’t find anything. The past few years, Sherry has been distracted from her anemia by the many surgeries she has needed on her large joints, probably because of her years on steroids. She has had both hips replaced. And both shoulders were replaced. Twice. But to the extent she can, she tries not to let any of this slow her down. She did have to retire from nursing. It broke her heart, she told me. But she worried that the clarity of her thinking was unpredictable, and she couldn’t expose those children to the risk that she would miss something because her blood levels were low.

Now she just tries to take care of her teenage children. And a patient husband. And, of course, her own body, when she has to.
