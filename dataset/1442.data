SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — We’ve had a fair number of tough Saturday crosswords over the last few months, and today’s offering does nothing to soften the curve. Robert H. Wolfe presents us with a mix of long entries, sly clues and some challenging vocabulary in a wide-open grid.

The grid is one that Mr. Wolfe has used three times in the past, and its unusual windmill design is more than just a tribute to the letter T. The black squares divide the puzzle into four solving quadrants composed of only 58 total answers. Only seven other Times constructors have matched or bettered that feat for a 15×15 grid.

One result of this is a total lack of three-letter entries and only four four-letter entries, both of which can be helpful in cracking a themeless puzzle. The other result is an extremely high number of common letters. E, R, S and T account for 99 out of the 190 grid letters. An additional 40 letters are either A, I or N. Assuming this in advance can help when solving.

The Details:

Did “Early 1990s first lady’s first name” have you searching in the United States when you should have been looking to Russia and Mr. Gorbachev’s bride? I wondered about the accuracy of “A conductor may have it memorized” for BUS LINE, since I’m not familiar with bus drivers being referred to as conductors, but the dictionary tells me otherwise. POLLUTERS for “They’re not green” was far down the line of interpretations I considered for that clue. YTTRIA, or yttrium oxide, is a compound that helps put the red in television picture tubes.

The toughest crossing for me was STI_ES crossing SE_TIMES. I spent a fair amount of time looking at that missing letter, until I vaguely remembered the word STIPE from somewhere deep in my brain. Thank goodness, because SEPTIMES wasn’t going to come, with or without that S on the end of it. Those were a bit out there, but I guess there’s no arguing that “Way out there” yielded the most ESOTERIC answer.

A Final Thought: Mr. Wolfe practices veterinary medicine on Long Island in New York at the Wolfe Animal Hospital. He’s been married 38 years, with two daughters and a granddaughter, runs three miles a day and plays the piano and guitar. He also writes poetry and has written a screenplay and a novel (as yet unsold) — as well as over 2,000 crossword puzzles.

Notice: The crossword community has lost Dan Naddor, a prolific constructor who passed away Tuesday night from cancer-related causes. More than 100 of his puzzles were published in the Los Angeles Times over the last three years. He made his New York Times debut this past August (Across Lite, Solution).
