Re "Richard Wagner, Musical Mensch" by Anthony Tommasini [April 10]:

Wagner may have been a raging megalomaniac and a ranting anti-Semite, as well as the composer whom Hitler deemed dearest to the Aryan soul. Yet when I, a Jew, joined the Metropolitan Opera orchestra in 1961, I was mystified to find that several of my Jewish colleagues -- elderly Holocaust survivors from major German opera houses and orchestras -- actually relished playing Wagner. I recall one violinist proudly showing us novices his Vienna Opera fingerings for murderous passages in "GÃ¶tterdammerung," which he knew from memory. I questioned him about his emotions when playing Wagner. With moist eyes, he bitterly complained about the numerous frevelhaft (sacrilegious) cuts in the Met score.
