Got the shakes for some lip balm? Try the Chap Stick Addicts support group on sixdegrees.com.

The group had about 250 active members at last count, and is adding more every day -- from a high school student who says she can't concentrate without her balm to another who can't walk into a dime store without buying a new stick.

The notion of Chap Stick as addictive product came as news to the folks at Whitehall-Robins, the American Home Products unit that makes Chap Stick. ''It's certainly not addictive -- it's a petroleum product for lips,'' said Carol Dornbush, a spokeswoman for the company, based in Madison, N.J. ''I guess we have a lot of loyal customers.''

Don't tell that, however, to the several dozen people who took to the site last week to discuss their habit, or any regular at Lip Balm Anonymous, an unrelated site (www.kevdo.com/lipbalm) whose stated purpose is to ''stay free from lip balm and to help others achieve the same freedom.'' The premise of those who see a potential for addiction is that lip balms eventually dry out the lips, forcing the user to apply more.

Chap Stick Addicts is only one of 15,000 discussion groups on sixdegrees.com, an advertising-supported site that states it was ''inspired'' by the theory that every person in the world is connected to every other person through no more than six relationships. The site appears to have a struck a chord: more than 6,000 new members sign up every day, each apparently interested in chatting with people of similar interests. A spokeswoman for the company, Rebecca Tompkins, partly attributes the popularity of the Chap Stick group to its being featured in the site's theme of the week section last week.
