Miss Musgrave knows how to set the English language infinitely better than most of her colleagues. Never is the natural accent of words wrenched askew; never is the natural flow interrupted. She also is enough of a traditionalist to work within established operatic conventions, and “The Voice of Ariadne” is built around solo, duet and other set pieces.

The libretto, too, is extremely intelligent. It has been adapted by Amalia Elguera from a Henry James Story “The Last of the Valerii.” Naturally, James being involved, there are all kinds of relationships. But basically the story tells about a Count infatuated with the Ariadne legend. He alone can hear her voice, and he falls in love. At the end his wife takes on Ariadne and conquers.

This is a bald synopsis of a very literate libretto, one that is capable of being interpreted on many levels. Nothing much really happens; there is no violent action or, indeed, much action of any kind. Yet the character development is so strong that the story holds the attention. And the entire production strives for a period quality that transcends the period. The sets and costumes by Carl Toms are naturalistic, handsome and rich‐looking, and Colin Graham's direction points everything toward the denouement. For once, in Henry James, an American can meet the European aristocracy on even terms.

Miss Musgrave's music uses a small orchestra, has taped sections—Ariadne is never seen, only her voice on tape heard—has a good deal of aleatory and plenty of dissonance. Yet it anything but avant‐garde. Miss Musgrave constantly tries for melody.

Whether she succeeds is another question. She still writes in a style that sounds very old‐fashioned, with oll those seconds and ninths. She favors a type of melodic declamation, and even the big numbers, where she wants to get a soaring line, manage to sound tight and constricted. Basically her resources are very limited. Textures sound monotonous after a while, and the musical materials are just not very interesting. What Miss Musgrave does, she does with integrity, but this is still. another opera that does not “sing.”
