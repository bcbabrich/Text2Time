If nobody complained, why the convulsion? Because those paying more than their share of costs were not prevented from finding alternatives. Lured by new technology, the F.C.C., starting in the late 50's, gradually let competitors skim the cream from Ma Bell's commercial and long-distance services - the very ones that were subsidizing local rates. And when the ensuing antitrust actions led to a divorce of A.T. & T.'s long- and short-distance systems, the F.C.C. had to find a way to replace the subsidies from long to short.

Though every phone is billed locally, most will still be served by several companies: Ma Bell's regional offspring, and long-distance connectors like A.T. & T. and its competitors. The economically pure remedy would be to charge every phone line $7 more a month, the amount of the old system's subsidy to local service. But that would ignite a rebellion against any change.

So the F.C.C. decided to shift the burden gradually, to charge business phones more than residential and to justify the higher charge by calling it a fee for ''access'' to the interstate system. This rationalization has gone down poorly with consumers trained to restrain their long-distance calls. And it has complicated the job of state regulators who may have to let local phone rates double in a decade. There are fears the increases will drive poorer families off the phone grid, destroying the universal service that benefits everyone. Congress already feels pressure to preserve the subsidies from long-distance to short. What's wrong with that? The short answer is efficiency. Technology promises many new conveniences, and savings, through long-distance communication; society will reap the benefits only if costs are properly allocated. A further answer is that innovations like cable and satellites will make it easier for high-volume business communicators to bypass the phone network altogether; stick them with the subsidy and they'll soon be unreachable. The best answer is that a carefully planned reform need not threaten universal service, while accurate pricing could produce billions in new benefits. The number of people who would drop phone service priced at full cost is probably very small; a tripling of rates tomorrow would leave the average family paying no more of its income for basic service than in 1950. And if Congress wants to protect the very poor, the least distorting way is to subsidize their phones directly. Or state regulators could freeze the cost of a no-frills service for the poor. But the truer the price for everyone else, the broader the social gain. Underpricing local calls may enrich a shut-in's communication with neighbors, but it severely limits communication with grandchildren or friends far away. And artificially high long-distance prices raise the price of everything else: business calls that might cost $2 end up in a letter that costs $3.50 to type. Small change, perhaps, until it dawns that Americans make 300 billion telephone calls a year. Will price reform improve service? Not if rate increases are beaten down politically and local phone companies are left starving. But a gradual approach to real costs can yield ever more efficiencies. Much depends on the political skill, and courage, of regulators and the understanding of the public.
