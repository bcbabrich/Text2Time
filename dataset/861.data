FERNAINE--Antoine V. Lutheran HealthCare in Brooklyn, NY, mourns the passing of Antoine V. Fernaine, M.D., former co-chief of the Department of Cardiology, a cardiologist at Lutheran Medical Center since 1979, and a key member of the Medical and Dental Staff. Dr. Fernaine was a highly respected physician, peer and friend to many. His passion for his patients and expertise in cardiovascular disease built the foundation for Lutheran's significant expansion in cardiology and the creation of the May Ellen and Gerald Ritter Cardiology Center. He will be sorely missed. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, physicians and staff of Lutheran HealthCare, we send our sincere condolences to his wife and his entire family. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the Antoine V. Fernaine Memorial Endowment at Lutheran HealthCare. A wake will be held at the McLaughlin and Sons Funeral Home, 9620 Third Avenue, Brooklyn, on Monday, September 1 from 7pm to 9pm and on Tuesday, September 2 from 2pm to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm. Services will be held on Wednesday, September 3 at St. Mary's Church, 192 81st Street, Brooklyn, at 10am.
