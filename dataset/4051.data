The Italian clothing manufacturer and retailer Benetton S.p.A. said yesterday that its profit rose 9 percent in the first half of the year even as its revenue held steady. Benetton said the improved profitability reflected cost containment and lower financing charges because of reduced debt.

The company earned 116 billion lire, or $77.3 million, up from 106 billion lire a year earlier. (AP)
