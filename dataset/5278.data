Three men were charged yesterday in the slaying of a Queens woman who was killed Saturday as she stood in her kitchen, talking on the telephone with her infant in her arms.

A fourth man, who fled after the car the suspects were riding in was stopped by the police at a checkpoint yesterday, was being sought by the police. He is also a suspect in the slaying.

The men were charged with second-degree murder in the death of the woman, Maxine Peterson, 43 years old, who was struck twice when a hail of bullets smashed through the kitchen windows of her house at 202-01 109th Avenue in Hollis, Queens. Mrs. Peterson was holding the youngest of her nine children when she was shot.
