An article on Wednesday about the Formosa Cafe in West Hollywood, Calif., incorrectly summarized the ownership history of Warner Hollywood Studios, which is seeking to have the restaurant demolished. The studio was built in 1919 as the Jesse D. Hampton Studios. It was taken over by United Artists in 1928 and acquired by the Samuel Goldwyn Studios in 1938. Warner bought it in 1980.
