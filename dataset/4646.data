With summer sports in full swing, weekend athletes who rip up shoulders and other joints will at least have the comfort of access to a new generation of surgical aids that can speed their recovery.

Until recently, orthopedic surgeons used screws and washers to pin torn ligaments and tendons to bone for the months it took the tissues to reattach themselves. But such devices were often too big or difficult to position properly at the exact spot of injury, leading to slow or incomplete recoveries.

Now, thanks to Mitek Surgical Products Inc. of Norwood, Mass., and Zimmer Inc., a subsidiary of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, surgeons can bury a bit of titanium alloy in the bone and use it as an anchor to sew the soft tissue into place. The technique typically requires a much smaller incision and less surgical skill, in addition to yielding more natural results.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved the anchors for use in shoulder surgery -- Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers pitcher, was an early recipient in 1990 -- and the agency is considering Mitek's application for orthopedic use throughout the body. While such clearance is needed before Mitek can advertise the device for use outside the shoulder, many doctors are employing it elsewhere without Mitek's encouragement.
