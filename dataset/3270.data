To the Editor:

Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Op-Ed, March 29) clearly implies that Elian Gonzalez needs to be rescued from the pernicious effects of immersion in American culture; hence Mr. Garcia Marquez's gratuitous reference to the recent classroom shooting in Michigan.

He should be informed that the defining characteristic of life in the United States is not violence but liberty, a blessing not to be found in Fidel Castro's totalitarian police state.
