WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — You would think that after having solved so many puzzles over the years, we would know everything there is to know about the relationship between the OREO cookie and crosswords. The miracle of this cookie is that, besides being delicious and the official dessert of the New York Times crossword, there are still things to discover about it.

For example, did you know that the word OREO comes from the combining form of the Greek word “oros,” which means “mountain”? You can read more about the history of the naming of our beloved OREO here, and you can click here to see how the cluing of OREO changed around 1993-1994, which is coincidentally when Will Shortz became crosswords editor. Make of that what you will, but I, for one, am profoundly grateful for it.

We haven’t seen a daily crossword puzzle by Fred Piscop in The New York Times since 2011, but he’s back today with a puzzle that made me hungry. While it is true that there is actually very little that doesn’t make me hungry, Mr. Piscop hit me in the sweet spot: pasta! We are used to seeing more theme material in crosswords these days, but the three theme entries and the surrounding fill made for a tame yet satisfying puzzle for midweek. We have three theme entries that use types of pasta — ZITI, ORZO and PENNE — as punny near sound-alikes for the real things, CITY COUNCILMAN, OR SO IT WOULD SEEM and PENNY ANTE POKER. While the three near sound-alikes are all amusing, I would have preferred to see all three entries as nouns. The middle theme entry, ORZO IT SEEMS, while clever, is not a noun like the other two theme entries and feels out of place to me.

In nontheme news, the fill is clean albeit not as lively as I normally like for a three-theme entry puzzle. This one felt more like a Monday to me. It looks like some attempt was made to make the clues for UBER and HUGE (clued to Donald Trump) up-to-date.

Let’s hear from Mr. Piscop:

Constructor’s Notes:

Not much to say here, really. One of the entries – PENNE, as I recall – came to me out of the blue. ZITI, of course, was quite easy to pun, and I had to juggle some ORSO phrases to come up with a good ORZO pun. As you might expect, though, other varieties of pasta don’t exactly lend themselves to punnery. RIGATONI (fix an acting award?)? FUSILLI (use a welding torch in a poor manner?)? I don’t think so.

Let’s move on to the Thursday puzzle with one of Melissa Clark’s delicious pasta recipes, including the secret behind what she calls “the lemon trick”:
