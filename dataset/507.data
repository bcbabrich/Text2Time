Long ago, in a distant galaxy, Hollywood’s superhero movies were as modest as the comic books or radio shows that spawned them, using special effects that now feel homespun to conjure fantasies with the artless quality of folk tales.

“Chandu the Magician” (1932), adapted from a popular nightly radio broadcast of the same name, is one such film. Reissued on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber, it concerns the adventures of the benign adventurer Frank Chandler (Edmund Lowe), who having studied the “mystic arts” and learned the “secrets of the Yogi,” is now known as Chandu. When a crystal ball reveals the world-conquering ambitions of the nihilistic madman Roxor (Bela Lugosi), based in Egypt, Chandu trades his turban for a pith helmet and then a burnoose, traveling from India to North Africa to confront the fiend.

Chandu is an indefatigable escape artist with the power to cloud men’s minds. He can induce hallucinations so that some subjects imagine they are scolded by tiny replicas of themselves and others believe that their guns have turned into snakes. With such an occult hero, “Chandu the Magician” anticipates “Doctor Strange,” the coming movie based on the Marvel character. But as a stout defender of Western values, and with his easy mastery of third-world civilizations, Chandu is a forerunner of Indiana Jones.

Directed with breathless panache by Marcel Varnel and William Cameron Menzies, the movie is a 71-minute fun house of mad scientists, comic camels, proto-TV transmissions, “death ray” machines, secret passages and slave markets. A glamorous princess (Irene Ware) is on hand as rescue bait, but the most glorious attraction is Mr. Lugosi, resplendent in black tights and a matching turban. The actor’s lunatic conviction is an ode to megalomania as he gloats, chortles and rants, expressing his desire to “be greater than any pharaoh!”
