Jim Leyland, who turned the Pittsburgh Pirates into contenders and guided them through the pressure of a pennant race, was selected as the National League manager of the year yesterday.

Leyland took a team that went 74-88 and was fifth in the National League East in 1989 and molded it into a division champion at 95-67. The Pirates overcame the Mets and all the odds in the stretch to finish with the second-best record in baseball.

Leyland got 17 of the 24 first-place votes and finished with 99 points. Lou Piniella, who led Cincinnati to the World Series championship in his first season with the Reds, got three first-place votes and was second with 49 points.
