The police stood guard inside the church and British troops poured into surrounding Catholic sections as Princess Alexandra, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth, arrived in Ulster today to attend the consecration of a Protestant cathedral.

Princess Alexandra flew to Ulster mainly to attend the consecration today of Belfast's new St. Anne's Church of Ireland Cathedral.

The police were stationed in the cathedral all night.

Guerrillas earlier detonated a powerful bomb in an attempt to destroy an armored police vehicle on a Londonderry street, but the explosion was mistimed. A police spokesman said one member of the patrol was injured although the blast, believed set off by remote control, destroyed the roof of a pub 300 feet away.

Extra troops of the local militia, the Ulster Defense Regiment, were drafted into Belfast's city center to search shops and bars, after The Rev. Ian Paisley, a militant Protestant leader, let slip yesterday that the Princess would make a previously unannounced visit. Troops were posted on rooftops and additional security forces moved into the two nearest residential districts, both heavily Catholic.
