In a country where the Flemish- and French-speaking populations have battled for decades, Mr. Leysen's role demonstrates the rapidly expanding economic power of the Flemish. Besides its industrial holdings, Generale is said to have interests in more than 1,200 companies, including major Belgian banks, armament makers, insurance companies and chemical and metals concerns. A Change in Criticism

While many of Belgium's newspapers have decried the idea of an Italian taking control of Belgium's largest holding company, last week many of Belgium's French-language papers attacked the idea that someone from Flanders might take control.

''A lot of Belgium's French-speaking people would much rather have de Benedetti take control than Leysen,'' one prominent Flemish journalist said.

Mr. Leysen, considered one of Belgium's most aggressive financiers, said last week that the investor group would buy 12 million new shares in Generale - all of the company's planned capitalization issue. If the issue, which would increase the company's capitalization by almost 60 percent, survives a court challenge, Mr. Leysen's group will pay almost $900 million to obtain about 34 percent of the company.

''Now it seems clear that Generale de Belgique will be changed fundamentally - whether or not de Benedetti ever gets a controlling interest,'' said Patrick Vermeulen, an analyst with Dewaay, Sebille Servais et Compagnie in Brussels. 'Why Not Collaborate?'

On Friday, Mr. Leysen suggested that he and Mr. de Benedetti talk. Some analysts said the men might join forces to improve Generale's undervalued stock price and underperforming operations. Perhaps the best known of these is the struggling Fabrique Nationale d'Armes d'Herstal S.A., known for the Browning gun.

''Let's accept the reality that there are two blocks of shareholders,'' Mr. Leysen said. ''Why not collaborate to defend the interests of all shareholders, managers and staff?'' He added, however, that he felt there was a ''need to anchor Societe Generale's share holdings firmly in Belgian hands.''
