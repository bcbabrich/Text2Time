A very unusual bridge game was being kibitzed by Dr. Simon Klein of Melville, L.I. It was, he decided, a battle between England and the United States, and three of the players were easily identifiable.

Sitting in a wheelchair in the West seat and waving his trademark cigarette holder was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His partner, wearing a superbly tailored general's uniform, was Dwight David Eisenhower, a man always ready to shuffle the cards. In the South seat, puffing on a cigar, was Winston Spencer Churchill, a man whose judgment in bridge was decidedly inferior to his judgment in politics.

The North player was harder to place, although like Churchill he was a writer of renown. William Somerset Maugham was looking at the hand of a long bridge-playing life. With 13 top tricks he could not resist the temptation to announce "seven hearts."

This was somewhat naive, and he failed to recognize that he was on the razor's edge. A slower approach, in the hope of being pushed into a grand slam, would have been more subtle. The danger was that an opponent might be provoked into bidding seven spades and that North-South would wind up with a small penalty.
