MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1984 International Preliminary talks with Moscow on arms control and other issues are expected to begin within a few weeks as a result of conversations with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, Reagan Administration officials said. But they said they doubted actual negotiations would resume before the end of this year or early next year. (Page A1, Column 6.) Jordan's renewal of ties with Egypt was defended by King Hussein. He challenged Syria, Libya and other critics of his decision to restore full diplomatic relations to come to a summit meeting to debate this and other issues that have divided Arab ranks. Syria turned down the King's invitation. (A1:2.)

China renewed overtures to Taiwan regarding reunification with the Communist mainland. Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang reiterated Peking's offer to let Taiwan retain its capitalist economic and social system if it was reunited with the mainland. China has said Taiwan would become a special administrative region like Hong Kong, but could have even broader autonomy. (A1:5.) An anti-Mafia roundup in Italy brought dozens of organized crime figures into custody. Officials described it as one of the most sweeping anti-Mafia operations ever conducted in Italy. The nationwide arrests began after a Mafia leader gave what officials described as detailed information on many crimes. (A1:3.) Cairo's chief judge gave prison terms to 107 Moslem extemists for trying to overthrow the Government in the aftermath of the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat. He acquitted 174 others. (A6:3.) National The most unfavorable TV coverage of President Reagan since he began his re-election campaign, according to White Housde advisers, focused on his impromptu remarks on the bombing of the United States Embassy in Lebanon. Both sides regard Mr. Reagan's tendency toward misstatement as a ''wild card'' in the national televised debates scheduled for Oct. 7 and Oct. 21, and this leads some Democrats to hope Walter F. Mondale can claw his way back into contention in the Presidential race. (A1:1.) The tough and sassy Queens parlance of Geraldine Ferraro has become the surprise hit of the campaign season. When she was chosen by Walter Mondale as his running mate, his aides privately worried that her speech might be ''too tough'' and ''too New York wise guy'' to play in proverbial Peoria. But they have watched with relief and growing admiration, as her colloquial diction and frankness have charmed audiences from Texas to California. (A1:1.) Do-it-yourself health testing devices are enabling people to check themselves for early symptoms of illness, from the onset of stress to certain forms of cancer. Rapid changes in technology, especially the development of smaller and cheaper computer chips, have led to such consumer medical products as the Ames Glucometer, the Astropulse and the E.P.T. Plus. Physicians say home testing can be useful, but they warn against self-diagnosis. (A1:4.) Failing citrus farms in Florida hit by a freeze last winter are another threat to the industry and to the hopes of growers like the Symmes family. On The Ridge, near Orlando, the prospect of foreclosure, unpaid taxes or having to sell out to developers are not related to the recent discovery of the citrus canker that has ruined other Florida groves. (A14:2.) An extension of spending levels for most Government agencies is expected to be approved today by the House. The Senate has approved the two-day extension to the keep the agencies operating. The measure would provide Congress with a 48- hour respite in its struggle to adopt a catchall spending resolution to keep the Government running in the new fiscal year, which began this morning. The respite is needed beause the Senate version of the spending bill is mired in a controversy involving a civil rights measure that supporters hope to attach to it. (A17:1.) Metropolitan Innovative prison construction is being used as states try to solve the problem of prison overcrowding. An example of this is the Southern State Correctional Facility in New Jersey, which looks like an Army training camp. It is the state's answer to how to build a prison in a hurry and at relatively low cost. (B2:1.) Fordham University's 31st president was installed in ceremonies at the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. He is the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, who was born in the Bronx 53 years ago. He succeeds the Rev. James C. Finlay, who retired in July. (B3:3.) Two teen-aged youths were arrested in the Bronx and charged with shooting a woman with an air pistol Thursday night at 97th Street and West Avenue in Manhattan. The police believe they were responsible for seven similar shootings in the Bronx and Manhattan Thursday night and early Friday morning. (B5:3.) A World Trade Center skyscraper will get underway tomorrow in the lower Manhattan block bounded by Vesey, Washington and Barclay Streets and West Broadway. The 47- story building will rise from a trapezoidal base. It will be the center's seventh and final building. (B16:4.) Page D1
