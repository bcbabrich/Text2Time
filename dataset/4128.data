Nicholas W. Leeson, who rose from a working-class background in a dreary London suburb to wealth and power in the macho, ego-laden world of financial trading, celebrated his 28th birthday last Saturday in hiding, presumably somewhere in Asia.

Two days earlier, Mr. Leeson and his 23-year-old wife, Lisa, had abruptly left their luxury apartment in Singapore, where he headed the derivatives trading operation of Barings P.L.C., the British investment firm that had employed him since 1989. He left behind a financial disaster that would bring down his employer within days and set off a wave of panic in world markets -- a crisis that judging by the evidence made public so far he had created.

Mr. Leeson remains in hiding -- perhaps, by some reports, at sea on his yacht or in Thailand -- and his story will be picked over for years by fellow traders, regulators, journalists and probably even film makers.

While the outcome of his trading is most unusual, his background is typical of the aggressive young traders who make a living by betting on arcane information flickering on computer screens at investment firms worldwide.
