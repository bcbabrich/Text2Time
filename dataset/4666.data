Pro-democracy campaigners imprisoned in northeast China have smuggled out a letter in which they charge that they are are often beaten, shocked with electric cattle prods and forced to work 12 or more hours a day making matchboxes.

The letter, which was made public today by Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, accuses prison officials of torturing some political prisoners so severely that they passed out. It also says the officials often call on common criminals to beat and humiliate the pro-democracy prisoners.

The best-known of the political prisoners reportedly subjected to this treatment is Liu Gang, a 30-year-old physicist who has campaigned since the mid-1980's for a free press and multi-party democracy. Mr. Liu is now in the fourth year of a six-year sentence for "counter-revolutionary conspiracy to subvert the government."

It had been known that Mr. Liu and other political prisoners were being kept at the Lingyuan Prison complex in Liaoning Province in the northeast. But until now little has been known about their condition.
