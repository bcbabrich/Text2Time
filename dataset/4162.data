For the second time in its 67-year history, the Goldman Open Pairs, the oldest event of its kind in the world, has been won by a married couple. In play Sunday in Manhattan, the winners, thanks to a 69 percent final session, were Robb and Linda Gordon of Manhattan. The only other married winners were Tobias and Jan Stone in 1957.

On the diagramed deal, Robb Gordon as West made a well-judged opening lead against a four-spade contract. With a choice between the club queen, the diamond king and the heart two, he chose the last. This was obviously a singleton, since in the partnership style he would have doubled one spade to show three-card heart support.

South won in dummy and adopted the obvious line of play. Assuming that West held the spade king as part of his opening bid, he cashed the ace and king of clubs and led the spade queen for a finesse. But East produced the king and gave her partner a heart ruff, for one down when West cashed his diamond winners.

This was worth 24.5 match points out of a possible 25, because at many other tables at which the game was reached West led a top diamond before shifting to the singleton heart. This gave South crucial information: West was now marked with both top diamonds and it was far more likely that the spade finesse would lose. So the declarers played the spade ace at the second trick and followed with a second round, eliminating the danger of a heart ruff. The diamond suit eventually produced two tricks, and a discard of the potential heart loser to make the game.
