First-time claims for unemployment benefits tumbled 28,000 in the most recent four-week reporting period, Labor Department figures indicated today. The average number of claims for the period fell to the lowest level since late 1989.

The unexpectedly sharp decline, which followed a week in which storms kept many workers from claims offices, was regarded by many as evidence that the economy's growing strength was spreading into the job market.

"I think you're going to see further improvement," predicted Daniel Laufenberg, an economist for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. Gains in output, he added, have so far been mainly a result of unsustainably rapid increases in productivity, with new hiring expected to follow inevitably.

At the same time, however, analysts said that the drop in jobless claims, to an average of 341,250 over the latest four weeks, still owed more to a slowing in layoffs than to the generation of new jobs.
