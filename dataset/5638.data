The New York State Health Commissioner plans to tighten the procedures doctors use for prescribing sedatives, including Valium, one of the most prescribed and abused drugs in the nation.

The Commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, wants to include Valium and 13 similar drugs, such as Ativan, Centrax, Dalmane, Librium, Restoril and Xanax, in a regulation that requires a triplicate prescription form, one copy of which goes to the State Health Department.

The drugs, benzodiazepines, are used to control anxiety, muscle spasms and convulsions.

Currently, 49 drugs are issued under the triplicate prescription system. They include certain amphetamines and barbiturates such as Demerol, Percodan and Secobarbitol. 'One of the Most Abused'

The proposal to include Valium and the 13 other drugs under the regulation could become effective as early as January, state health officials said. The Commissioner's aim is to catch physicians who are profiteering from the drugs, to stop doctors who are prescribing the drugs unnecesarily and to keep the drugs from making their way to the street and the illicit market.
