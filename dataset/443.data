Season 5, Episode 2: ‘Nev-AD-da’

President Meyer is more often defined by her ambition, narcissism, salty tongue or barely veiled disdain for her daughter than she is by her romantic relationships. That makes “Veep” both progressive and refreshing from a gender perspective. She has been vice president or president of the United States for five seasons now: When would she have time to find, or even care about finding, a man?

In this week’s episode, a tick-tock of the events on a key day in the Nevada recount, Selina makes the time, reminding her aides that, while she may be president, she’s still a woman with certain … urges. “I’m human,” she says. “I just sometimes need a little banking task force.”

Only in Washington — or, possibly, some corners of Manhattan’s financial district — would the term “banking task force” be used as a euphemism for sex. In Selina’s case, it’s also coded language for the person with whom she wants to have sex: Charlie Baird, the financial power player portrayed by John Slattery, is a C.E.O. with whom she immediately clicks at the banking task force meeting originally organized by Tom James. Since everything on “Veep” involves at least 50 shades of awkward, Selina’s efforts to flirt with Charlie are less than deft; at one point she tries to telegraph her attraction by showing him a random closet in the White House where “Harding fathered a child with his teenage mistress.” Wow. What a turn-on.

Nevertheless, Charlie and Selina manage to, um, “task force,” which seems like a terrible idea. It’s obvious that their liaison will become public knowledge (it does) and that, presumably, being romantically linked to a 1 percenter from the business world will reflect poorly on Selina. “President in Bed, Literally, With Wall Street”: The headline-writing is right there on the wall. But “Veep,” in its brilliance, makes the Selina/Charlie encounter a mistake that politically weakens Selina for unexpected reasons. It turns out Charlie may be tapped by Selina’s rival, Bill O’Brien, to serve as treasury secretary if O’Brien wins the presidency, a fact the silver-haired fox doesn’t bother to share with Selina. His failure to fully disclose before disrobing leads to their immediate breakup and hits on the core theme of this episode: rampant miscommunication.
