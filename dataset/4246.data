Coach Rich Kotite calls Matt O'Dwyer a tough guy, just like he used to be.

Boomer Esiason reminded the rookie in the huddle last Sunday at Seattle, "You came in with a reputation as the toughest guy in the draft." Esiason, the old pro who delights in bringing newcomers down a peg, paused and added, "The only reason you're starting is Carlton Haselrig isn't playing."

When the Jets face the St. Louis Rams on Sunday at Giants Stadium, it will mark O'Dwyer's second straight start at right guard. The Jets have refused to disclose why Haselrig isn't playing or where he is.

Enter O'Dwyer. Until last Sunday, his most prominent roles had been as a fill-in at guard and for his spirited play during practice and the exhibition season, when the Giants complained about his tactics.

Those contentions don't sit well with O'Dwyer, who played for Northwestern rather than "football factories like Nebraska." Now, he wonders, will his mother have the wrong opinion of him?
