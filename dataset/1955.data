The Football Scientist, KC Joyner, contributes weekly to The Fifth Down. His latest book is “Blindsided: Why the Left Tackle is Overrated and Other Contrarian Football Thoughts.”

I often say that I review players with both a metric eye (meaning via statistical analysis) and a scouting eye (meaning via traditional tape analysis). At no position is this statement truer than at quarterback. With that thought in mind, here is my take on the question of which quarterback I would pick to guide my team for the next 10 years: Eli Manning or Tony Romo.

I’ll start with the metric overview. There are three main metrics I use for gauging quarterback play: yards per attempt (YPA), success percentage and bad decision percentage. I use these in place of the official passer rating system because that method tends to reward dink and dunk quarterbacks and punish gunslingers. In this series of measurements each type of quarterback will have his individual strengths and weaknesses displayed, and as such I think it makes for a more detailed, granular form of analysis.

Yards Per Attempt

I use four route depth levels when tracking YPA. They are: short (1-10 yards), medium (11-19 yards), deep (20-29 yards) and bomb (30+ yards). Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 totals through week 8:

Manning

Route Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 139 100 823 4 1 3 18 5.9 Medium 48 24 411 2 1 4 20 8.3 Deep 19 8 217 1 1 1 5 11.1 Bomb 13 3 106 2 1 1 31 9.8 Other 10 1 31 0 0 0 0 3.1 Total 229 136 1588 9 4 9 74 7.0

Romo

Route Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 132 98 923 6 1 2 9 7.0 Medium 35 19 374 4 3 0 0 10.7 Deep 14 4 108 1 1 1 -10 6.5 Bomb 10 5 264 3 0 0 0 26.4 Other 11 0 0 0 0 1 5 0.4 Total 202 126 1669 14 5 4 4 8.1

Romo has been better this year on short passes by just over a yard and he was better in 2007 by a similar amount. Romo also has a lead in two of the three vertical routes (i.e. medium, deep and bomb) and his combined YPA on vertical passes is also much higher (10.3 to 8.6).

This doesn’t look like a one-year anomaly, either, as Romo’s 2007 vertical YPA was appreciably better than Manning’s (12.2 to 8.8), although to be fair some of the metric difference in 2007 probably had to do with Plaxico Burress’ injury. Even with that caveat, I still have to give the overall YPA edge to Romo.

Success Percentage

Success percentage is determined by adding the number of completions and defensive passing penalties (i.e. any penalties that happen while the pass is in the air, such as pass interference, illegal contact, etc.) and dividing that total by the total number of attempts. The total number of attempts includes both the defensive and offensive pass penalties (e.g. offensive pass interference). Other passes are balls that either don’t make it past the line of scrimmage (e.g. pass knocked down at line) or are throwaway tosses.

Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 success percentage totals by route depth:

Manning

Route Depth Success % Short 74.1% Medium 56.3% Deep 47.4% Bomb 30.8% Other 10.0% Total 62.9%

Romo

Route Depth Success % Short 75.8% Medium 54.3% Deep 35.7% Bomb 50.0% Other 9.1% Total 64.4%

This is a very even contest. Manning is a bit better in medium passes and much better in deep ones, but Romo has a big edge in bomb throws and a slight edge in short ones. The overall split between these two in 2008 is negligible but in 2007 and 2006 Romo’s percentages were quite superior over Manning’s (64.5% to 57.1% in 2007, 65.6% to 58.7% in 2006). Again, a metric segment goes in favor of Romo.



Bad Decision Percentage



This metric gauges how often a quarterback makes a mistake with a pass that either leads to an interception or a near interception. These gaffes can range from staring at a receiver to not seeing a defender in a passing lane, but the common thread is that they are errors that generate turnover opportunities for the opponent.

The key to keep in mind in this metric is that small percentages make a huge difference. For example, a 2.0% bad decision rate means that a passer is messing up once in every fifty passes. A 3.0% rate in this category doesn’t look that much higher but it means a quarterback’s error rate is now up to once in every thirty-three passes. To express this in game terms, the 2.0% rate means the mistakes are coming about two times in every three games (or less if the team doesn’t throw often), while the 3.0% means they are probably coming once in every single contest.

So how do Romo and Manning fare in this category? Thus far in 2008, they are about equal. Manning has a 2.5 % rate and Romo a 2.9% rate. That wasn’t the case in 2007, however, as Romo’s 4.0% bad decision clip ranked him 5th worst among qualifying quarterbacks. Manning wasn’t that much better but his 3.4% rate was lower. Their 2006 totals were about equal (1.9% for Romo, 1.8% for Manning), so that means that Manning gets the overall edge in this category, albeit by moderate margin.

Intangibles

This is where the scouting eye comes in. I look for a lot of things when scouting QBs but it really boils down to one question – does he make his team play better than their talent level says they should?

Take Philip Rivers. It is said that he possesses great intangibles and that those were a main reason his NC State teams went 34-17. The track record says something a bit different. To quote from Scientific Football 2006, “Winning two out of every three games is a praiseworthy feat…but in this case there should be a big asterisk next to it. Fourteen of [Rivers’] thirty-four wins came against teams that either ended the season with three wins or less or were non-Division 1A opponents. Two more victories came against teams that ended the season with four wins. Add them up and it means that nearly one-half of Rivers’ collegiate wins came against poor competition. Or, to put it another way, Rivers was 18-17 against good teams.”

I point this out because Rivers and Manning came into the league at the same time and Rivers is always touted for his leadership while Manning has often been knocked for his lack of fire. I used to be one of the pundits who knocked Manning, but I stopped doing this once I saw that his teams were doing better and going further than Rivers’ more talented Chargers teams.

For instance, Rivers led a team with a 12-14 win talent level to a 14-2 mark in 2006, but then piloted them to a home divisional playoff game loss. The 2007 Chargers were nearly as loaded as their predecessors and he guided them to a wild-card berth. He won the opening playoff game that season against a limited Tennessee roster and technically got the win in the divisional round, but he wasn’t on the field when San Diego’s offense made their comeback. The Bolts were quite banged up for the AFC championship and couldn’t overcome the Patriots. Put it all together and it means that Rivers has but the single wild-card playoff win that he can claim as his own. That’s a poor record when you have a physically superior team, as the Chargers were in those seasons.

Contrast that to Manning. The Giants have always had a very good roster, but my personnel eye says they were not in San Diego’s league. New York also played in a division that was strong from top to bottom, unlike the AFC West. In spite of this, Manning has led his team to more playoff berths and more playoff wins than Rivers has. I don’t like to lean solely on the win criterion, as it has its weaknesses (see Trent Dilfer and the 2000 Ravens), but in this case Manning has done a lot more with a less than Rivers has, so I’ve taken to giving him the edge in that matchup.

Now let’s look at Romo. The Cowboys have been the near equals (if not equals) to the Chargers in roster strength the past couple of seasons and yet Romo has not a single playoff win to show for it. He also lost a home divisional game to a Manning-led Giants squad last year. I can’t put all of that on Romo, but lack of leadership is one of the reasons that team is losing the big games, and some of that does fall at the feet of the quarterback. That means Manning gets a large edge in this department and it’s the reason I have to go with Manning as the better QB.
