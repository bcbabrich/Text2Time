PETRA, Jordan, Oct. 31 (UPI) —The rose‐red city of Petra, an awesome collaboration be tween man and nature, is sink ing back into the silence that enveloped it for centuries.

Tourists have stopped com ing because of Jordan's wars. Government excavations have been halted for lack of money. One Petra hotel has been closed since the 1967 Mideast war; a second nearby is open but empty. The city is deserted and quiet, except for a handful of Bedouin squatters and their sheep.

Petra, sprawled across a nearly inaccessible ravine at the end of a mile‐long canyon, is a triumph of human Imagination and an almost perfectly preserved portrait of a civiliza tion that flourished more than 2,000 years ago.

The city was founded about 300 B.C. by Nabataean Arabs who grew wealthy on tribute from passing caravans. Later they became traders and em pire‐builders. They traveled widely and brought Greek ar chitecture back to their home.
