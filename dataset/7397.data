PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 31—The Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations reported today that The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily News had voluntarily agreed to exclude racial references in classified advertising for jobs.

Thomas A. Masterson, commission secretary, said the policy was adopted Jan. 28. He said it did not forbid racial references in advertising for jobs such as baby sitter, housekeeper and housework.

“However,” he said, “The Inquirer and Daily News agreed to eliminate such references because they share the commission's opinion that they tend to perpetuate discriminatory practices.”

The New York Times has a policy of refusing to print advertisements that contain references to race or religion.
