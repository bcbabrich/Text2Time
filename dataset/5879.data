PERHAPS aspiring to the mantle once worn by such entertainers as Bob Hope and Martha Raye, Suzanne Somers appears to be turning into a trouper in search of a war. Since leaving ABC's ''Three's Company,'' following a rather nasty and very public salary dispute, Miss Somers has been doing a nightclub act and an occasional variety special for CBS. Her last television appearance was taped aboard the aircraft carrier Ranger at the San Diego Naval Station. Tonight at 10, she can be seen entertaining Army and Air Force personnel at Ramstein Air Base in Kaiserslautern, West Germany. The hour is called, with an almost leering exclamation point, ''Suzanne Somers ... and 10,000 G.I.s!''

As an ambassador to the armed forces, Miss Somers falls somewhere between the typical beauty-contest winner paraded out for such occasions and ''Verna: the U.S.O. Girl,'' the vulnerable, questionably talented young woman created by the writer Paul Gallico and depicted on television not too long ago by Sissy Spacek. With a perky personality and shaggy blond hair, she is unflaggingly awed and sincere. Bouncing onto the stage in red sequined tights, she tells her understandably cheering audience: ''What a welcome! I can't believe it! Fifty thousand soldiers all to myself!'' The exclamation point is clearly an integral part of the Somers act.

The supporting cast includes Jonathan Winters, whose appearances are kept noticeably short, especially when he shows the slightest inclination to become too irreverent about the event. The Pointer Sisters are brought on to do their foot-tapping, hand-clapping act, but not before Miss Somers has co-opted their popular ''Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'' number for herself. And Susan Anton, another blond actress-singer who has had a checkered television career, does a solo and some cute production numbers with Miss Somers. Miss Anton is very tall.

Miss Somers does try, going from slightly blue material (''I thought bivouac was something you did with a paddle'') to the blatantly manipulative (bringing a serviceman up from the audience while she sings ''You Made Me Love You''). Throughout, an effort is made to portray the G.I.'s as lonely guys doing their duty on the front lines. Sometimes, a serviceman appears on the screen to send greetings back home (''Hello to mom and dad, and Rosa and Jose Vasquez'').
