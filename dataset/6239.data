By WILLIAM ROBBINS Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON, Jan. 31—The Nixon Administration acted today to put millions of acres of idle farm land back into production and thus help check the rise in food prices.

The action will also reduce the cost of farm subsidies. This year, total subsidies are expected to be $1‐billion below last year's levels.

Food prices can be expected to begin reflecting the effects of the action after crops are in, in the late summer and fall, experts at the Department of Agriculture said.

The move—a reduction in the amount of land that farmers must leave idle to qualify for subsidy payments on livestock feeds from the Federal Government, was announced by Earl L. Butz, the Secretary of Agriculture.
