Forty years ago Sunday, on Sept. 2, 1972, in Montreal, one of the most stunning upsets in the history of sports took place. Team Canada — an N.H.L. all-star team led by Phil Esposito, Brad Park, Yvan Cournoyer, Frank and Peter Mahovlich, Bobby Clarke,Ken Dryden and the Rangers’ GAG Line of Jean Ratelle, Rod Gilbert and Vic Hadfield — met the Soviet national team, the world and Olympic champion but a group that had never played a game against professional opponents.

It was supposed to be a cakewalk for the Canadians, what many in North America believed would be the first of eight straight victories against the supposedly outclassed visitors from behind the Iron Curtain.

And indeed that’s how it started, with quick goals from Esposito and Paul Henderson. The organist at the Montreal Forum played a funeral march. Esposito laughed and wondered on the bench whether they should take it easy so as not to embarrass the Soviets.

But then Yevgeny Zimin scored, then Vladimir Petrov, then Valeri Kharlamov – twice – and Boris Mikhailov, Zimin again and Aleksander Yakushev.

When it was all over, the Soviets — swirling, passing, creating beautiful play after beautiful play on clockwork rushes — had shocked the Canadians, 7-3. Canada’s image as an unassailable hockey superpower was shattered forever.

Vladimir Petrov centered the great Soviet first line in the 1972 Summit Series, flanked by his wings, Boris Mikhailov and Valery Kharlamov; he scored three goals and four assists in the series’ eight games. Last week, Petrov answered our questions via e-mail from Russia on what it was like to play that first game in Montreal, in what was then the terra incognita of head-to-head hockey against the great Canadian professionals.

Q.

Were you as astonished by your victory as everyone else in the hockey world?

A.

Naturally we were very surprised with the result of the first game. None of us could even think about such an outcome.

Before the game some officials from the sports committee told us, “Just don’t lose by a big margin.”

Q.

Do you think you caught the Canadians off guard?

A.

It was easier for us to play against them than it was for the Canadians to play against us. We were quite experienced players — we had behind us the Olympics and world championship tournaments. We tried to study them, but they did not bother to collect information about us.

So for them it was a surprise when they saw us continuing to play our game even after we went down, 0-2, in the first seven minutes.

After the first victory our bosses who asked us to lose only by the minimum started to tell us that we now must win all the games and we have no right to lose.

Q.

What was it like to go to Canada?

A.

We were surprised with many things, starting with the royal treatment we received in hotels and so on. After Game 1 we were recognized at every Canadian airport, and people were stepping aside to make corridors for us to walk down. As we were going through them some fans gave us friendly slaps on our shoulders. We even joked that Kharlamov had more slaps from fans than body checks in that first game.

Q.

The Canadians were already playing rough in Game 1 of the series. What was your reaction?

A.

Speaking frankly, we had no experience of playing in a game of such intensity.

We were not followers of the Leo Tolstoy philosophy — if you get a slap on the cheek, give him one back. We had some fights, but we were instructed from the very beginning that it is better to score more goals than to have some fights.

But naturally we paid back, and as you know some players still remember my friend Boris. [Mikhailov kicked Gary Bergman in the leg with his skate blade in Game 7, bloodying Bergman’s leg.] But that’s history. At that time nobody could foresee that we were forging the history of modern hockey.
