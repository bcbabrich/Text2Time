"The idea here is that there is something akin to a thermostat that regulates body fat," said Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, a molecular geneticist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Rockefeller University in New York and a discoverer of leptin. A set point, like the temperature setting on a thermostat, would be the body fat level that the brain maintains to keep leptin concentrations optimal.

The idea of leptin as a signaler of body fat can help explain why some people are naturally fatter than others. For example, some people may have fat cells that are genetically disposed to make meager amounts of leptin. Their bodies would need to create more fat cells in order to contribute the right amount of leptin to the bloodstream. Others may be genetically predisposed to respond weakly to the hormone, perhaps because the receptor molecules on their brain cells, where leptin exerts its signals, only feebly bind the hormone. These people too would need more fat cells for the brain to feel it had received the right signal for its fat-thermostat setting.

The notion of a leptin as a body fat regulator may also lead to an understanding of how body weight is inherited. Identical twins reared apart turn out to weigh almost exactly the same. Children who were adopted resemble their biological parents in terms of body weight, rather than their adoptive ones. What may be inherited is an ability of fat cells to make leptin at a particular rate or an ability of the brain to respond to the hormone.

The effects of leptin on metabolism and food intake may also explain the finding that body weight is maintained not just by the regulation of appetite but also by adjustments in metabolic rates. Mice that have too much leptin greatly increase their metabolic rates and decrease their food intake until they lose enough fat to bring their leptin levels into line. The hormone is thought to act on the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls appetite and metabolism.

People also adjust their metabolic rates and food intake when their body fat is greatly altered. The extreme example of what may turn out to be a severe leptin deficiency comes from studies of people who weigh at least double what they should who participated in research requiring them to live on a hospital ward for a year or more while their food intake was carefully controlled. Their weights plummeted to what was considered be ideal for their heights, but their bodies became deranged. Their metabolisms were sluggish and they were always cold. They were obsessed with thoughts of food. The women stopped menstruating. Although they looked normal, they behaved as though they were starving.
