Mery Griffin confirmed yes terday that he is taking his late‐night talk show to Cali fornia.

Reports that Mr. Griffin was planning to move to the West Coast have been widespread for several months. The TV host said he would leave for Holly wood tomorrow. The first pro gram there will be taped Sun day evening and will be aired on the Columbia Broadcasting System either the following Tuesday or Wednesday.

“I'm delighted with the move,” Mr. Griffin said. “Some thing had to be done. There are three late‐night talk shows in New York and the same guests bounce from one to an other. Hollywood will give us a lot of fresh faces.”

Audience to Be Smaller

Mr. Griffin said his show would originate in Studio 43 in Television City, which has about 200 fewer seats than the Cort Theater, in which the New York show was taped, but a much larger stage area.

Mr. Griffin's move to the West Coast also paves the way for participation by Saul Ilson and Ernest Chambers, who signed as creative consultants with Mr. Griffin last week but whose contract depended on West Coast origination. The consultants have served as ex ecutive producers of such shows as “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” and “The Leslie Uggams Show.”
