“We worship an awesome God in the blue states,” Senator Barack Obama said in his star-making speech at the 2004 Democratic convention. Democrats would go on to do some major soul searching about why people who called themselves “values voters” were voting for Republicans. The party has looked for ways to close the “God Gap” and some view Mr. Obama as a Democrat who just might have the whole “God talk” thing down.

That didn’t stop some major conservative Christian leaders from objecting to Mr. Obama’s scheduled appearance at an AIDS summit at Saddleback Church, a California megachurch run by Pastor Rick Warren, author of “The Purpose-Driven Life.” Phyllis Schlafly, the head of the Eagle Forum, led 17 other conservative leaders in a letter urging Mr. Warren to rescind the invitation due to Mr. Obama’s support of legalized abortion:



You cannot fight one evil while justifying another. The evangelical church can provide no genuine help for those who suffer from AIDS if those involved do not first have their ethic of life firmly rooted in the Word of God.

Mr. Warren defended his decision and stuck to it:

This summit will put people together who normally won’t even speak to each other. But if you can only work with folks you completely agree with, you’ve ruled out most of the world.

So Mr. Obama appeared earlier today, and despite the furor building up to his appearance, he didn’t hesitate to make comments that might alienate his hosts:

Like no other illness, AIDS tests our ability to put ourselves in somebody else’s shoes, to empathize with the plight of our fellow man, to live up to the Golden Rule. While most would agree that the AIDS orphan or the transfusion victim or the wronged wife contracting the disease through no fault of their own needs help, sometimes it’s been easy for us to distance ourselves from those who we think are somehow at fault — the promiscuous youth or the unfaithful husband or the gay man — and say, ‘This is your fault, you’ve sinned. We have nothing to do with you.’ And I don’t think that’s a satisfactory response. My faith reminds me that we are all sinners. My faith reminds me that there are times where I have fallen and made mistakes. My faith tells me, as Pastor Rick has said, that it’s not a sin to be sick. My Bible tells me that when God sent His only son to Earth it was to heal the sick and comfort the weary and feed the hungry and clothe the naked, to befriend the outcast and redeem those who had strayed from righteousness.

And, in the something-for-everyone style the junior senator from Illinois is becoming famous for, he even had a little bit of political grist for Republicans in the audience:

Now, let me say this: I want to publicly applaud the Bush administration — I don’t do that that often. And sometimes unfairly so. Because this is an area where I think the Bush administration has not gotten enough credit. The administration and this Congress have been serious about putting resources in contributing to the fight against HIV and AIDS.

Tonight, Mr. Obama moves on to a more secular stage, when he’ll appear on the Jay Leno show. Let’s hope he has the audacity to best one of Mr. Leno’s jokes.
