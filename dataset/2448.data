The pianist Marc-André Hamelin has made his name by programming intensely difficult works and then dispatching them not only with an ironclad technique, but with thoughtfulness and musicality as well. That combination of qualities is clearly in demand: when he performed at the International Keyboard Institute and Festival at the Mannes College of Music on Saturday evening, the school's concert hall was packed.

Mr. Hamelin's program was a concise tour of Romantic pianism, from its Classical roots in the early decades of the 19th century, through the unabashed exhibitionism that extended into the 20th century. This is music of composers who were also pianists, and who wrote to their own strengths. The 20th century saw the end of that -- and a preference, among composers, for the hyper-rational rather than the overtly showy. But Romantic pianism never quite died away, and judging from the performances at Mannes these last couple of weeks, in fact, it has returned with a vengeance.

Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 664), in Mr. Hamelin's reading, had a graceful Classical veneer, with the rumblings of Romantic rebelliousness peeking through its textures. In its first movement especially, it was as though the melodies in the right hand were etched by Mozart, while the left hand accompaniments were by Beethoven. Mr. Hamelin, in keeping his dynamics and phrasing flexible, made that tension especially poignant.

The Schubert Sonata shared the first half of the program with nine of Leopold Godowsky's "Studies After Chopin's Études." In these astonishing reworkings, Godowsky took the already difficult Chopin études as a starting point, and painted on fresh decorative layers. In some cases that meant padding out chords to create a bigger, richer sound. Elsewhere, it was a matter of reharmonizing the originals, setting Chopin's familiar themes amid strange hues and textures.
