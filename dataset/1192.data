After a year of trying a Tumblr page, the Web site for NBCLatino.com is ready to face its readers. On Monday, NBC News will officially announce the site dedicated to news and features for a Latino audience.

“We want to tell the Hispanic-American story with Hispanic-American voices in English,” said Chris Peña, the site’s executive editor. “It’s a young demographic; we know it’s a growing demographic.”

Content on the site includes articles and videos on immigration, politics, parenting, lifestyle and food.

“Its not that we want Latino news,” Mr. Peña said. “We want culturally relevant content.”

Staff members for the Web site are bilingual in English and Spanish, indicating a push toward creating content for a bicultural Latino market.

“There hasn’t been a lot of attention paid to people who are bilingual and who speak English and who have grown up in bilingual homes,” said Steve Capus, the president of NBC News. “There’s an audience that we think is underserved and highly valued.”

Natalie Morales, the “Today” show news anchor on NBC, will contribute to the site, as will Tom Llamas, Gabe Gutierrez and Miguel Almaguer. The site will also take content from MSNBC, Telemundo, “Today” and the nightly news.

“Network news, if you will, looks different now than it did 20 years ago,” Mr. Capus said of the anchors and correspondents. “We’ve got some very high-profile players who reflect the diversity in this country.”
