There is the remembered grandeur of the Penn Station demolished in 1963 and the envisioned grandeur of the new Penn Station proposed at the post office site. In between is a dreary, sweltering, subterranean hub with an industrial-basement atmosphere.

But this summer, in the culmination of a $190 million renovation by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a new central entrance will open: a 90-foot-high glass and brick tower on the south side of 34th Street just west of Seventh Avenue. A rediscovered clock from the original Pennsylvania Station will hang there.

"It's going to be the Long Island Rail Road's new front door," said James C. Collins, the project manager. "It's something we've never really had, with all our side entrances, and it will give the station an identity."

The tower will hold powerful air-conditioning equipment to cool the terminal, long vilified as an inferno in the summer months.
