To the Editor:

A. M. Rosenthal (column, July 29) suggests that it would be imprudent to send William F. Weld as ambassador to Mexico because Mr. Weld is ''soft'' on drugs.

An ambassador is supposed to act on behalf of a particular government, as a President is supposed to act on behalf of the people.

An ambassador's individual opinions on a particular issue should not affect administration policy. As William J. Bennett says in his adjoining Op-Ed article, on alcohol marketing and inner-city crime, ''conservatives need to go where the facts, not ideology, lead.''
