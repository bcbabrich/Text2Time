Detroit Lions

Quarterback Rodney Peete and the Lions resolved their contract differences. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but the Lions said the contract was dependent upon Peete's passing his physical. A starter since his rookie season in 1989, Peete, a sixth-round draft choice from the University of Southern California, missed the last half of the 1991 season and the playoffs after tearing his Achilles' tendon.

The Seahawks reeled in the big one, coming to terms on a four-year deal with their 300-pound first-round draft choice, Ray Roberts, an offensive tackle from Virginia. Roberts (No. 10 over all in the 1992 draft) is expected to sign today, leaving only one missing rookie, wide receiver Michael Bates, a sixth-round (No. 151) pick from Arizona. Bates has been excused from camp. He is on the United States Olympic track team as a 200-meter man. Denver Broncos

It's not that quarterback John Elway won't have any friends to throw to, but after bidding adios to Ricky Nattiel (traded to Tampa Bay) and Vance Johnson (out for three months with a shoulder tear) the Broncos' Three Amigos are down to one, Mark Jackson.

The team's receiving corps has been further depleted by off-season back surgery to wide receiver Michael Young, who is expected to miss most of training camp, and a broken ankle suffered last Saturday by running back Steve Sewell, a favorite Elway target on third down.
