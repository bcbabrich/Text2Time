Add Melvin Lowe to the roster of strongmen who have fallen from power in this season of democratic rebirth. Under pressure from a state Supreme Court, Mr. Lowe has resigned as chairman of the Student Senate at the City University of New York.

The reason: He is no longer a student.

Mr. Lowe might have had some reason to start thinking of himself as chairman for life. He was elected three times to the office, which carries such perquisites as a seat on the CUNY Board of Trustees, a stipend of about $6,000 a year and control of a staff and an annual budget of $300,000 - activity fees collected from the university's 180,000 students and meant to be spent for their benefit. What became unforgivable was Mr. Lowe's behaving like chairman for life. He had to be taken to court for moving the date of new elections from last January to May. And then it emerged that he had not even bothered to register for classes at Hunter College this semester.

Mr. Lowe has resigned and dropped from sight. The university has commissioned an audit of Student Senate finances during his tenure. And an interim regime has been installed. It promises new elections in May.
