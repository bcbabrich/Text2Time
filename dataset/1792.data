WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — I heeded this puzzle’s 62 Across advice before I even knew what it was. If HASTE MAKES WASTE, then my solving performance on this puzzle was pretty frugal. It wasn’t that I preferred to plod, it was just the pace the puzzle imposed. Of course that very same HASTE MAKES WASTE entry serves as a hint to the puzzle’s theme, the idea being that if you change the H in HASTE, it makes WASTE.

The Details:

Regarding the theme, BASE WIT in the center of the puzzle was a nice extra touch. And an amusing one as well. “Bread in a jar, perhaps” was a great clue for TIPS and “Big Indian” had me scratching my head before discovering it was RAJA. Did you know LYNDA Carter, a k a TV’s Wonder Woman, was a former Miss World USA? I didn’t, but the next time it comes up in conversation, I’ll be armed. I’m not sure if that’s a good or a bad thing.

“Pikake garland” was something new for LEI, which is always a good thing. In case you’re wondering, pikake isn’t a Hawaiian city, it’s a species of jasmine. Along with plumeria, it’s the most common flower used to make a lei. Maile vines and leaves might also be used, especially if you’ve got hula dancing or getting married scheduled for the afternoon.

Looking for a way to share the puzzle with your children? Here’s a word search game they can play using your completed puzzle: Find AL 16 times in the grid, reading forward, backward, up, down or diagonally. (Or if you happen to know Alexander Haig, give it to him to try. He turns 85 today.)
