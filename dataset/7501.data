LONDON, Sept. 30—The calm of Britain's general election campaign was shattered today when Harold Wilson voiced Labor party suspicions that a strike in the vital automobile industry was politically motivated to damage Labor's chances in the voting two weeks from tomorrow.

Mr. Wilson, the party leader, followed this up tonight with a major campaign speech in which he charged the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas ‐ Home, with “one of the most fatuous deceptions ever” in contending that Britain's economy “has seldom if ever been stronger.”

Referring to yesterday's official figures showing that Britain spent £256 million ($716.8 million) more than she earned in the first half of 1964, Mr. Wilson said the economy had been kept going only by borrowing heavily from the British Commonwealth and, more recently, from New York.

‘Crawling’ to U.S. Scored

“Not content with crawling to the Americans and. becoming dependent on them for a weapon they regard as vital, Sir Alec and his colleagues are putting us in pawn economically,” the Labor leader charged.
