To the Editor:

American consumers now pay more than twice what they should for sugar! But Senator Daniel K. Inouye has sponsored a provision in the 1989 appropriations bill for agriculture that would further subsidize a few large sugar refiners under the guise of helping the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries and the Philippines.

United States sugar refiners would purchase raw sugar at the domestic price (again, more than two times higher than the world price) from Caribbean Basin producers and the Philippines. Domestic refiners would refine and export the sugar to the world market at the substantially lower world price. The taxpayer would then compensate domestic refiners for the difference.

This is a business subsidy in its worst form because the domestic sugar program, which artificially props up prices by virtually precluding sugar imports from other countries, already costs the United States consumer nearly $3 billion a year!

And this sugar export enchancement program would cost taxpayers $140 million more a year, with the subsidy going to about 10 major refiners.
