Two polls published several weeks earlier had shown similar divergences.

The candidates themselves, like most of their supporters, see the race developing in something close to even terms.

''I see it very close, with me a little bit ahead,'' said Mr. Bond.

Mark Ulven, Mrs. Woods's press secretary, said: ''Our own polling shows the race a dead heat. I really believe the momentum has shifted our way.'' Vast Differences in Candidates

The candidates themselves show differences as great, both in personalities and in backgrounds, as the polling results.

Mr. Bond, 47 years old, the son of a middle-Missouri manufacturing family and a graduate of Princeton University, has the more privileged background of the two. But he exhibits a manner that, as one expert put it the other day, ''is not too urbane, not too folksy, just professional.''

He finished first in his law school class at the University of Virginia, became a clerk for a Federal appeals court in Atlanta and worked for a Washington law firm before returning to Missouri.

Back home, he started early and near the top in politics, running for Congress at the age of 29. He lost that race but in 1970, at the age of 31, he upset an entrenched incumbent to become State Auditor. Two years later he was elected Governor, a post in which he faced repeated conflicts with Democratic legislative majorities. He was defeated in a race for re-election in 1976 but ran successfully for a second term in 1980. Former Newspaper Reporter

Mrs. Woods, 59, a candidate who often seems to captivate audiences (''I hate the word charisma, but she has it,'' said one analyst who has followed her campaign.) is a native of Cleveland and a graduate of the University of Michigan who first came to Missouri as a newspaper reporter in St. Louis. Her first political race, at the age of 40, was for membership on the City Council of University City, a St. Louis suburb.
