John Turner won a resounding endorsement today for his continued leadership of the Liberal Party at a national convention.

Delegates to the convention voted to keep Mr. Turner by a margin of 2,001 to 622.

Gathering 76.3 percent of the vote, Mr. Turner considerably surpassed the total various foes had said would be necessary for him to continue.

Mr. Turner's victory represents a major comeback from his September 1984 defeat by the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Brian Mulroney.

''Now I know that I have your confidence,'' Mr. Turner told the convention. He said his task now would be to prepare for a federal election in 1988.
