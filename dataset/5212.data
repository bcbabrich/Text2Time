Pat Robertson's well-heeled Presidential campaign adjusted its financial course again today by agreeing to accept $4.5 million in Federal matching funds. But it pledged to put the money in escrow while Mr. Robertson decides whether to keep it or try to give it back.

Mr. Robertson, the former television minister, has raised $11 million and is eligible for the additional $4.5 million in matching money. He had asked the Federal Election Commission to delay dispensing the matching money for 30 days while he decided whether to accept it.

However, the Robertson campaign today withdrew the request and on Monday will receive the $4.5 million from the United States Treasury.

Mr. Robertson's campaign manager, R. Marc Nuttle, said that the campaign ''plans to segregate the funds'' while deciding ''whether to seek an advisory opinion from the F.E.C. about the possibility of giving the money back to the American taxpayers without incurring any liabilities.''
