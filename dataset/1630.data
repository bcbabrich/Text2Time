MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — Approaching the Fountainebleau Hotel here on Wednesday — a purely journalistic mission, I assure you — I noticed a large contingent of Cincinnati Bearcat players were waiting outside.

That wasn’t the only thing I noticed, as the swanky digs were filled with scantily clad women returning form the pool, loud conversations in all sorts of foreign languages and just a wild medley of people.

But it was moving day for the Bearcats because Coach Brian Kelly knew that his desire for New Year’s peace and quiet wouldn’t likely happen. Diddy, the star rapper whose fame transcends his many name changes, was hosting a New Year’s party at the Fountainbleau. Let’s just say that those tickets were a bit harder to come by than Orange Bowl ducats. (Tickets for the game were going for 99 cents on eBay earlier this week.)

Always coaching, Kelly knew when he saw a mismatch. He punted on his team staying at the hotel, where they’d been all week, moving them to a more remote and sedate location.

“It’s the Orange Bowl, it’s exciting,” Kelly said. “You’re going to have those kinds of things. But I won’t get a chance to see the show.”

Instead, the well-rested Bearcats will hope to put on one of their own.
