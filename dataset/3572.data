The commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf region said today that the American military buildup in the area had in all likelihood thwarted the threat of hostilities by Iraq, but warned that a military confrontation remained a possibility.

Addressing American troops here, the commander, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, said that he did not yet know when the United States would be able to withdraw additional forces sent to the region last month during the most recent showdown with Iraq.

''The biggest question is where are we on the crisis and how long are we here,'' he said to the troops. ''I will tell you we are not out of the woods on the crisis even though things have leveled off a little bit.''

General Zinni, a stocky, blunt-spoken marine, is the commander in chief of the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla., the position held during the Persian Gulf war by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. General Zinni's remarks came as he completed a brief holiday visit to troops in the region, which also included stops at American bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
