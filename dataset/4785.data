The nation's two biggest auto makers announced huge first-quarter losses today.

The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest car maker, reported a net loss of $377 million. It would have reported a $1.1 billion loss except for one-time gains from an accounting change and the sale of the G.M. Building in New York.

The Ford Motor Company posted a quarterly loss of $884 million.

Although the companies' failure to make money was unsurprising, given the slumping economy, the size of the losses underscored the vulnerability of the nation's biggest manufacturing industry to worldwide competition. Ford Sees Improvement

Ford's vehicle production and sales to dealers are expected to improve sharply in this quarter, but Ford said it would probably not be profitable because of competitive pressure in the American market caused by a glut of worldwide production capacity. Moreover, Ford said it would be "difficult" to make a profit for 1991.

Robert C. Stempel, the chairman and chief executive of G.M., said the company was facing "the toughest and most competitive North American automotive market in the corporation's history."
