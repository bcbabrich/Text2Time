To the Editor:

Although I support the military operation in Afghanistan, the Oct. 29 photograph of four Afghan children being prepared for burial after an American airstrike is as haunting as some of the images from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against our country. The accompanying news article about more civilian deaths because of the airstrikes is equally disturbing.

A dearth of obvious targets seems to be forcing the United States military to strike at marginal targets, leading to the death of innocent civilians. No matter how much good will the United States' military operation enjoys, if major military actions can't be justified, the American people, and their supporters around the world, will see these actions as an illegitimate and unnecessary use of force.

The government has prepared us for, and we will accept, a long and difficult war against terrorism. Now the United States government and the military should take their time, and do it right.
