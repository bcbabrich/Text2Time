'All the Protection'

Dexter Lehtinen, the acting United States Attorney in Miami, replied to Mr. Rubino's charges in a written statement saying: ''Mr. Noriega has been accorded all the protection of due process and right to counsel. Nothing the Government has done regarding illegally obtained assets has infringed on these rights in any way.''

Judge Hoeveler said he expected to meet with defense lawyers and prosecutors on Wednesday in an effort to resolve the impasse over General Noriega's funds. He said it was possible that the defense would decide to sue the Government to force release of some of the assets, but Mr. Rubino said he had not yet decided on additional steps.

Mr. Rubino said Judge Hoeveler had considerable leeway under the law to appoint a public defender or other counsel, or if he chooses, to force the present lawyers to continue to defend General Noriega. Judge Hoeveler said it would be difficult for a public defender to handle a case that ''will require enormous resources.''

The United States Government, Mr. Rubino asserted, was claiming that all the general's assets, estimated at between $20 million and $60 million, were profits from illegal activities and therefore were subject to seizure. Mr. Rubino and other defense lawyers strongly disputed the Government's contention.

Question of Money's Origins

At least a portion of General Noriega's assets had been earned legitimately, Mr. Rubino contended. He made a point of arguing that some of the frozen assets had come from fees that Central Intelligence had paid to General Noriega over the years for services to the United States Government.

Mr. Rubino estimated that charges and expenses incurred in General Noriega's defense had mounted to more than $1 million, and he said that defending the general was threatening to bankrupt him. After more than four months of nearly full-time work, Mr. Rubino said, he and other defense lawyers have received less than $100,000 for expenses including travel, hotels and secretarial fees.

In addition, the burden of defending General Noriega, Mr. Rubino said, has prevented him from taking on several clients whose cases he would have accepted under other circumstances.
