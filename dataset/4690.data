Here are some excerpts from the conversation:

Q. The Governor has directed you to focus your attention on the cities. Why?

A. I sometimes feel we don't understand our cities too well. The Governor suggested that I would like to become involved in his urban initiatives. We put together a team of deputy commissioners and visited 10 cities during the summer to listen. We learned that cities would like coordinated service delivery, less red tape (which is an impediment to getting things done), more dollars for reimbursement for nonprofits and tentative steps toward regionalization.

You've got a fair part of the state's population living in cities, so they are worth caring about. They offer us a great deal. Our cities are critical. They have a cultural richness that feeds the surrounding towns.

Q. Can the state offer more money to the cities as compensation for their untaxable properties like hospitals and universities?

A. I think cities would certainly like to have greater compensation, but the question is, does the state have the capacity to do that? The books in this state are balanced. However, we have a statutory spending cap next year. That frees up $440 million that can be spent on programs in addition to what we spend this year: $104 million have been earmarked for corrections; $282 million has been earmarked for educational cost sharing for the towns. That's almost $400 million.

That doesn't take into consideration what the increase will be in Federal Medicaid payments. It doesn't even touch urban initiatives, educational initiatives, health initiatives, all of which are tremendous concerns. And it doesn't take into consideration anything for business. Don't forget the bottom line in all of this is that somebody's got to pay for it. The only way we can get the money is to develop the revenue base. That's why we are fighting to attract and retain every single job, every single business. They make such an enormous contribution to the state.
