Here is a random sampling from manufacturers' documentations that supposedly clarify things for newcomers to home computers.

- ''You can use (WSBAUD.BAS) to set the baud rate for your (computer). However the setting will only be in effect as long as the computer is not rebooted from a cold start.''

- ''Remember to initialize the sum before the next FOR-NEXT loop.'' - Examples of Daisy Wheel Pitch Changes: 'The word ''Acrammed'' is printed in alternate pitch will print with the word ''crammed'' in 12 pitch and the rest in 10 pitch if no preceeding. CW commands have altered pitch.''

- ''The Override procedure used to (1) override BSC parameters specified in the user program without recompiling the program, or (2) specified parameters that cannot be specified by the user program.''

- ''The main menu, showing single-control-character (non-prefix) editing commands, displays at the default help level, level 3.'' Should you decide that you can muddle through this mystery, that you are going to keep your equipment, you'll be urged to send in your ownership registration card to the manufacturer. Your may be surprised to find, though, that you are not a consumer (as in consumer's name, address, etc). You are an ''end user,'' whatever that means.

Having dutifully mailed in your card, you are then warned to ''write protect'' in bold letters somewhere. It means that your program disks are not protected against accidental erasures; to keep your program from self-destructing you have to put a piece of tape over one of the notches. You know, write protect.

You are also told in the beginning of the documentation that you should sit in the ''cockpit'' at your terminal, facing your keyboard and monitor. Do you think that means pull up a chair and get yourself familiar with your computer?

The trouble is that the words and expressions begin to make sense after a while. You find yourself ''interfacing'' (talking) with other owners, blurting out sentences like: ''We really felt the need to buy a double-sided double disk drive. After all, we have a growing family.'' Or, ''The dot matrix printer is okay if you're just using it around the house, but I'd never think of having my output seen in public without an LQP.''

Should you feel the urge to be part of a brotherhood of computer owners (user group) you may decide to start by picking up some magazines at your computer store (product center). A quick scan will convince you that English is not spoken here. The following are honest-to-goodness excerpts from letters to the editor in a recent edition of one of them:

- ''(The author of an article's) comment, 'The fact that the PC uses the Intel 8088 microprocessor...makes it a strictly ASCII machine' is nonsense. The 8088 processor does not preclude the use of EBCDIC or any other character code.''

- ''The account you gave of the origins of the MS-DOS is incorrect. MS-DOS was originally written by Seattle Computer Products under the name 86-DOS. Microsoft modified 86-DOS for the PC and in late 1981 bought the rights to 86-DOS from SCP for distribution as MS-DOS.''
