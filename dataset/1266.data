The Clippers rookie Blake Griffin scored 30 points and pulled down 12 rebounds Wednesday night to record his 20th straight double-double.

That broke the team record set in 1986-87 by Michael Cage, and it is the longest double-double streak by any N.B.A. rookie in 40 years.

Only Kevin Garnett (37) and David Lee (24) have had longer streaks in the last 10 years. Since 1986-87, only Charles Barkley (26 and 23), Hakeem Olajuwon (26) and Kevin Willis (21) have recorded more than 20 consecutive double-doubles.

Griffin, who missed last season with a knee injury, seems to be a leading contender for rookie of the year. He is averaging an impressive 21.5 points and 12.4 rebounds and puts his streak on the line Sunday when the Clippers host Atlanta.

Eight rookies in N.B.A. history have averaged at least 20 points and 12 rebounds: Bob Pettit, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Walt Bellamy, Elvin Hayes, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Robinson and Shaquille O’Neal. Seven of them are Hall of Famers, and O’Neal is sure to join them.

The one chink in Griffin’s armor so far this season has been his free-throw shooting. He is 158 for 270 at the line (58.5 percent).
