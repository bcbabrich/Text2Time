The Beame administration yesterday ruled out using the $200 million in new tax revenues to cancel any of the $200 million worth of layoffs and reduced services ordered earlier this year, before the new taxes were forced on the city.

First Deputy Mayor‐designate John E. Zuccotti said the extra revenues, approved la,st week as part of the latest fiscal rescue of the city would be used to reduce the deficit that still existed, not to rebuild the payroll or spare threatened day‐care centers and other popular services.that are scheduled to be closed.

“Regardless of the increased revenues, we intend to go forward with a $200 million budget‐reduction package,” he declared, emphasizing the priority of making budget cuts totaling $725 million in three annual reductions so that the imbalance of the city's budget can be ended by mid‐1978.

While Mr. Zuccotti was explaining the city's plans for its new revenues, Congress was preparing to enact the Federal legislation that is the other major ingredient in the current package to avert default. The House is expected to approve today President Ford's proposal for $2.3 billion in Federal loans to the city. [Page 78.]
