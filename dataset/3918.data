Cleanest of all would be electrification with power from no-fuel ''renewable'' technologies like wind. But with a stubbornly low price of oil, and declining prices for coal, their future popularity is hard to predict.

Globally, electricity use is growing; in this country, about 40 percent of all fuel is converted to electricity before the energy is consumed; that total is slowly rising. Another area for improvement, therefore, is the choice of fuel and the means by which it is converted to electricity.

Of the hydrocarbon fuels, coal has more carbon than hydrogen, and when it is burned -- or oxidized -- it produces relatively little H2O and lots of CO2. Oil is more evenly balanced, and natural gas is mostly hydrogen, and so the fuels line up in that order in greenhouse effect.

But in coal plants and conventional oil and gas plants, two-thirds of the heat potential of the fuel is lost by the generating process, which involves heating water into steam, using some of the steam's energy to turn a generator, and then cooling the steam back into water.

From a greenhouse standpoint, natural gas presents a better possibility, because it has less carbon and because a modern combined-cycle plant wastes only about half the heat value of the fuel. It burns gas in a jet engine and uses the waste heat to boil water and make more electricity, thus producing about a quarter of a pound of carbon per kilowatt-hour. (Enough power to light 10 100-watt bulbs for an hour; a typical American house uses about 20 kilowatt-hours a day.) In contrast, a coal plant that makes the same amount of electricity produces about six-tenths of a pound.

But in many places, coal, for now, is the cheapest or only option.

Carbon dioxide output from electricity production is already large, and could become staggering. According to Westinghouse, which wants to sell zero-carbon nuclear reactors, China was consuming 560 billion kilowatt-hours in 1990, when about 70 percent of its electric grid was powered by coal, but wants to triple output to 1,593 billion kilowatt-hours by 2010, which would vastly increase carbon emissions. (By contrast, in 1990 the United States was using 20 times as much electricity per person as China, about double China's projected level for 2010.)

The next step, to hold down carbon emissions, is to make the best use of the electricity.

Take, for example, the way that Coors paints its beer cans. For years it used the traditional method: applying paint and then running the cans on a conveyor belt through a giant natural gas oven. The paints emitted pollutants, so Coors used yet more natural gas to burn the fumes.
