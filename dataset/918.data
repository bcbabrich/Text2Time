The case of Burch vs. Burch is about to be closed.

After a year of legal wrangling between the designer Tory Burch and her former husband, Chris Burch, who is also the owner of the clothing retailer C. Wonder, Ms. Burch announced on Tuesday night that an agreement had been reached to settle all pending legal claims between the couple.

Additionally, Ms. Burch said that BDT Capital Partners and General Atlantic were making minority investments in the company. Mr. Burch will retain at least some of his stake in the business, which the Burches founded together in 2003 while they were still married.

Mr. Burch had filed a lawsuit against Ms. Burch in October, claiming that she and the board members of her company had interfered with his attempts to sell part of his 28 percent stake. Ms. Burch responded with counterclaims that Mr. Burch was at fault because, after their divorce in 2007, he started C. Wonder, a company with similar preppy clothing and store designs to hers. Any interested investors were hesitant to make a deal until the Burches settled their differences.

While the spat spilled over into the press, and then the courts (a judge in the case described it as a “drunken WASP fest”), both parties were interested in a settlement to protect their investments in the Tory Burch brand, which has sales of roughly $800 million annually and has been one of the most successful new fashion businesses of the last decade.
