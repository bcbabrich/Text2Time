Wimbledon and St Averil have been withdrawn from Saturday's Kentucky Derby because of minor injuries, reducing the field to 18 horses.

Wimbledon, who won the Louisiana Derby before finishing fifth in the Santa Anita Derby, was scratched Friday morning after his trainer, Bob Baffert, discovered a knot about the size of a dime on the left front leg near a tendon.

''These things sometimes may not be that bad,'' said Baffert, a three-time Kentucky Derby winner who will have no Derby starter for the first time since 1995. ''I don't think it's a career-ending injury, but it's enough that we don't feel comfortable about taking him out there and running him this weekend.''

Baffert said that he had Wimbledon jog and that he was all right.

''He's not sore, but I had a vet come in there and look at it, and there is something going on there,'' Baffert said. ''It's probably not that bad right now, but if we were to go out there and run him, then you can really hurt him.''
