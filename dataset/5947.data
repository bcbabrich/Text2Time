''We are taking in about 70 percent of our total budget in ticket sales,'' he said, adding that the corporate side and ancillary efforts have made up the difference.

However, he said that the theater capacity in both the 500-seat facility and the larger 2,310-seat one ran about 60 percent last year. During the coming season, the center hoped to raise that to 90 percent.

''With the help of Stanly Simon, the Borough President of the Bronx, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs has given us a grant of $25,000 for the elderly, which will pay for half of their half-price tickets,'' he said. Ticket prices range from $7 to $15 for all performances.

Mr. Light has dropped last year's plan to increase rental income from the two theaters, because they are used most of the time. For example, the center is now the home of most of the Bronx's performing-arts groups, including the Bronx Opera, the Bronx Symphony Orchestra, the Bronx dance theater and the Bronx Arts Ensemble. In addition, the college's academic departments, mostly music, theater and dance, are heavily using the 500-seat theater now, he said. Some of the costs for these operations are offset by the Bronx Borough President's Office,

''In short,'' Mr. Light said, ''we are really striving to be a community theater, and Westchester is considered part of our community.'' Group sales, he said, are particularly strong from Westchester.

The managing director said that many performing-arts groups were considering the Lehman center as a doorstep to Manhattan. This trend has been continuing since the first season, and many groups who want to play New York but can't afford the tremendous costs of renting in Manhattan, or for other reasons, are doing this.

The Dayton Ballet, which is coming in March is one example of this trend, and that troupe will have a New York premiere, ''Stage Piece,'' then, Mr. Light said. This was true in previous years of thePittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Le Grand Ballet Canadien. ''Afterward they went downtown and then to S.U.N.Y. Purchase. We got them tremendous press coverage, and now they are coming regularly. Last year Ballet Jazz made its New York City debut at Lehman College, and this year the Ballet Hispanico will have a world premiere by Patricia Birch, their choreographer, on Nov. 20.
