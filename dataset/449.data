MONDAY PUZZLE — Paula Gamache is back, and she seems to be telling us something in her theme.

You’ll find that something in the revealer at 41A (ME TOO), which explains why there are two MEs in each of Ms. Gamache’s theme entries, like 18A’s PRIME TIME.

Beginning solvers, there are three more theme entries like that for you to find, and some of you might be having a hard time finding those entries. Here are a couple of general hints on how to locate theme entries in a Monday puzzle:

– Sometimes, although not today, the theme entries might end with a question mark.

– Theme entries are usually, but not always, the longer entries in an early week puzzle.

– If you know about diagonal symmetry in crossword grids, the theme entries will usually lie opposite each other. In the grid to the right (not today’s puzzle), for example, one theme entry can be found at 17A (shaded in blue) and another can be found at its symmetrical opposite at 58A (shaded in green). The other two theme entries for that day are at the symmetrical entries 24- and 51A.

And, if you need another hint, sometimes there’s what we call a revealer, which ties up the theme nicely. In Ms. Gamache’s puzzle, the central entry ME TOO, takes a familiar phrase and reinterprets it to help you understand the theme.

Just in case you need something uplifting to start your week, here’s a compilation of (in my opinion) the best “Greeting to a returning soldier, maybe.”
