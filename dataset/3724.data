Got that?

It is the Republican-turned-Democrat vs. the Democrat-turned-Republican in heavily Republican Suffolk County, and even Mr. Bianchi and Ms. Mazzarelli acknowledge that their campaigns are known less for the issues than for political intrigue.

Ms. Mazzarelli calls Mr. Bianchi a hologram and a puppet. Mr. Bianchi says his challenger is an opportunist. Advertisements by the Republican State Committee say, ''Vote No on Debra Mazzarelli,'' without ever mentioning that Mr. Bianchi is its man.

''I'm a Democrat with a little 'd,' not a New York City D,'' Mr. Bianchi said in a telephone interview from his home in Bellport. ''My voting record is not that different, not that far off from the Republican positions.''

Ms. Mazzarelli, of Patchogue, is a former telephone union worker who was picked in 1994 by John Powell, the Republican county leader, to challenge Mr. Bianchi. With the powerful Republican apparatus behind her, the previously unknown Ms. Mazzarelli sent Mr. Bianchi back to tend to his orchids.

Now, after being re-elected in 1996 as a Republican, she faces her first challenge as a Democrat.

''The Republican Party has been influenced by the extreme right,'' she said of her decision to jump ship to the Democrats. ''The litmus test for a good Republican is being anti-choice, and I couldn't go for that. The Republican Party is not standing up for women or working-class people.''
