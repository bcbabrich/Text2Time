The academy does not replace Zingaro, which is preparing a new show, ''Loungta, the Horses of the Wind,'' to celebrate its 20th anniversary this year. But the two institutions are linked by more than Bartabas. ''Zingaro created an original kind of equestrian show, but we always had trouble recruiting,'' Bartabas -- he uses only this name -- explained. ''For dance and theater, there are schools and conservatories. But Zingaro needed people with more than equestrian technique and there was no school to create equestrian artists.''

Bartabas's good fortune was to be granted space in the Grande Écurie, which, along with the adjacent and identical Petite Écurie, has been variously occupied by the army, government archives and local government offices since 1830. Now, with a $2.5 million government grant, part of the Grande Écurie has been renovated to provide classrooms for the students as well as fine stables for the 28 horses donated by Zingaro and for Bartabas's own mount when he gives classes here.

But the jewel of the restoration, which was carried out by the French architect Patrick Bouchain, is the manège, or horse training arena, which occupies a large 17th-century hall. Mr. Bouchain has covered the walls with pine and mirrors and has lighted the sandy area with 15 chandeliers. At one end of the hall he has built bleachers with room for some 600 spectators. And off this viewing space is a reception area that looks toward the Palace of Versailles.

The academy is hoping to draw about 150,000 visitors a year, each paying the equivalent of $7.50, from among the 2.5 million tourists who visit the palace each year. Indeed, since the academy will receive no further government assistance, it is counting on these visitors to provide at least half of its $1.6 million budget, with the rest coming from sponsors. Saddles, for instance, have been donated by Hermès and riding habits by the Belgian designer Dries van Noten.

Perhaps most remarkable, however, is that this entire operation has been created for just 10 students and 4 so-called aspirants. Even ''student'' is a misnomer: they are given free board and lodging and are paid the equivalent of $1,000 a month. Chosen from among 100 applicants, all have extensive riding experience, including participation in dressage competitions and, in three cases, several years of performing with the Zingaro group.
