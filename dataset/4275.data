And because this network of parallel streets is all under the jurisdiction of the City of Los Angeles, rather than a patchwork of smaller municipalities, it is relatively simple for state and local officials to work together on a designated smart corridor, which was nearing completion when the earthquake struck. The smart corridor includes sensors embedded in the road that calculate the speed and number of vehicles, closed-circuit television monitors that let transportation officials watch traffic and changeable message signs urging motorists to try other routes.

These innovations let state and local transportation officials assess how well the detours are working around the 3.4 miles of closed freeway and to fine-tune the system, which was put in place within hours of the quake.

The system involves two detours in each direction, shorter ones for cars carrying two or more passengers and longer ones for single drivers, who face a $271 fine for cheating. The 1976 experiment defined a car pool by the more onerous standard of three or more passengers.

The number of motorists choosing the car pool detours, although low, has steadily increased: 700 during the peak hour of the morning eastbound drive and 1,100 during the peak hours of the morning westbound drive and the afternoon drives in both directions. Cutting Delays

State transportation officials wonder if the relatively low car pool numbers are a result of how well they have fine-tuned the detours. Early on, delays beyond normal driving time for solo commuters were as long as 27 minutes, while for car pools it was about 6 minutes. Now, delays hover at six minutes and one minute, respectively.

The improvement is a result of re-marking ramps to create two narrow lanes where there had been one; adding a second left-turn lane at difficult intersections, and increasing the number of orange detour signs so fewer people make mistakes along the way.

"We got things going good before we got a car pool mindset in place," said Perry Lowdin, the state's deputy chief of traffic operations. "It wasn't hard enough for long enough."
