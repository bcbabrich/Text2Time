THEY may be wearing pinstriped uniforms, but five of the nine Yankees in tonight's batting order still have to prove they're Yankees.

And you can prove you're a Yankee only by winning the World Series.

Anything less, as George Steinbrenner would be the first to tell you, means you've failed to do what has been done by so many proven Yankees, who Joe Torre called ''my guys'' -- earn four World Series rings in five years and come within the ninth inning of another ring a year ago.

Many of Torre's guys are still here: Derek Jeter at shortstop, Bernie Williams in center field, Jorge Posada catching, and several pitchers, notably Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, David Wells, Orlando Hern√°ndez and Mariano Rivera. And even without a World Series ring, second baseman Alfonso Soriano has shown he's a Yankee.

But the Yankees' success this month figures to turn on those new guys.

Of the five new postseason Yankees in tonight's opener of the American League division series against the Anaheim Angels, first baseman Jason Giambi and third baseman Robin Ventura don't need to be introduced. But will they be as productive in the postseason as Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius were?
