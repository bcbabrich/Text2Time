The city of Richmond, Va., put the streets and sidewalks in and around a crime-ridden public housing project off-limits to nonresidents in 1997 in an effort, duplicated elsewhere around the country, to control crime by controlling access.

The question for the Supreme Court today was whether the city violated the First Amendment by turning a public space into a no-trespass zone where those who want to distribute leaflets, speak, or simply visit family at the 4,100-unit Whitcomb Court need the permission of the police or a housing authority official.

After the hourlong argument, the answer to that question appeared to be: perhaps, but not in this case.

The trespass policy was challenged by a man who was arrested on a sidewalk in the middle of the downtown Whitcomb complex, where his mother and children lived. The trespass conviction was the third for Kevin L. Hicks, who had previously been notified by the property manager that he was ''not welcome'' there and would be arrested if seen on the property again. A state appeals court and the Virginia Supreme Court ruled in his appeal that the policy was so broad, so vaguely written and gave so much discretion to officials to decide who could enter and speak that it violated the First Amendment.
