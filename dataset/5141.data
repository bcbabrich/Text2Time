The Xerox Corporation reported a 7.2 percent gain in second-quarter earnings today and attributed the improvement to its revamping.

Earnings totaled $179 million, or $1.67 a share, for the April-June quarter, compared with $167 million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose nearly 8 percent, to $4.4 billion, from $4.1 billion.

''These results indicate we are on track toward achieving our goals for 1989,'' said David T. Kearns, chairman and chief executive of Xerox, the world's leading maker of copying machines.

''Improved financial returns from business products and systems in this year's second half and in the years beyond will result from the restructuring program we announced in January, plus our continuing emphasis on customer satisfaction and tight cost controls,'' Mr. Kearns said.
