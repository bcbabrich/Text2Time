A collision between two vehicles last night at Farmers Boulevard and 110th Avenue in Queens sent at least four people to the hospital, injuring two critically, the police said. A Long Island man was arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, the police said.

At least four people were taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens. The police said there were five persons in the vehicle that was hit shortly after 9, but a spokeswoman at Mary Immaculate could confirm that only four persons were at the hospital -- a 35-year-old man and three girls, 7, 11 and 14 years old.

The man who was arrested, whom police identified as Paul Wachter of Westbury, was listed in stable condition at Queens General Hospital.
