The players suspended are German Mesa, a smooth-fielding 27-year-old shortstop who had been a national idol, pitcher Orlando Hernandez and catcher Alberto Hernandez. According to news accounts from Havana, all three were summoned Monday to the headquarters of Cuban State Security and questioned for several hours about their relationship with Juan Ignacio Hernandez Nodar, a sports agent.

Hernandez Nodar is a cousin and former assistant of Joe Cubas, the Miami sports agent who arranged the defection of the bulk of the nearly dozen Cuban baseball players who have signed contracts with Major League Baseball teams over the past five years. Granma said Hernandez Nodar was preparing to take the three players out of Cuba ''in a fraudulent manner'' and now faces criminal charges for having attempted to do so.

''Through the investigations that have been carried out, it has been convincingly demonstrated that he first collaborated in these actions with the notorious trafficker Joe Cubas, who dedicates himself to harassing, bribing and corrupting Cuban sportsmen,'' the Granma account said of Hernandez Nodar. ''Lately he has done so on his own and has been the direct instigator of organizing the defection of our athletes.''

The Cuban Government has vowed to bring down ''the full weight of the law'' on Hernandez Nodar, who is not related to either of the banned players with the same surname. It was not clear whether charges had already been filed against him, but Prensa Latina said the agent had been ''carrying out the work of attracting young players'' and had developed ''close ties'' with the suspended players by offering them gifts.

''This is directed not only at me but at the remaining players on the Cuban national team,'' Cubas said in an interview here, adding that he had sought to persuade the three suspended players to defect, but that all had refused. ''The Cuban Government is trying to send the message that, should you be in a position to defect and we catch you beforehand, you will pay the price.''
