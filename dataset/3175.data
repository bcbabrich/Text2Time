Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. React to patriotic symbols; evaluate ways in which Americans have demonstrated their feelings of patriotism since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks; explore patriotism as a common reaction to national crisis.

2. Examine how patriotism can unite and divide a country in times of crisis by reading and discussing “Flag Fever: the Paradox of Patriotism.”

3. Develop questions and strategies for interviewing people of their parents’, grandparents’, or great-grandparents’ generations, focusing on times of national crisis or tragedy through which they lived.

4. Conduct interviews; compile interview information in a creative way.

Resources / Materials:

-patriotic items representing your country to display in the classroom (flags, advertisements, quotations, etc.)

-recording of patriotic tunes of your country and playing device

-classroom board

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-copies of “Flag Fever: the Paradox of Patriotism” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, display one or several patriotic items representing your country on the classroom board or around the room, and arrange for patriotic music of your country to be playing as students enter the classroom. Students respond in their journals to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “What does ‘patriotism’ mean to you? How do the items in the environment of the classroom make you feel? Why do these types of symbols evoke these feelings? Think about ways in which Americans have demonstrated their feelings of patriotism since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. What other patriotic symbols and actions can you list, either that are typical representations of patriotism or ones that are specific to the reactions to the terrorist attacks?” After five minutes, encourage students to share their answers. (You might want to share Merriam-Webster’s definition of patriotism: “love or devotion to one’s country.”) Then, further the discussion by posing these questions: Why is increased patriotism often a reaction to national crisis? Is there is ever a negative side to such nation-wide patriotism for some people, and if so, when and to whom?

2. As a class, read and discuss “Flag Fever: the Paradox of Patriotism,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why, until September 11, 2001, had “generations of Americans never found a compelling reason to take a stiff drink of patriotism or take comfort in its unifying high”? To what generations does this refer?

b. How does this article seem to define “patriotism”?

c. How have geographical and political boundaries somewhat disappeared since the terrorist attacks and the resulting sense of patriotism, according to this article?

d. What are “Constitutional rights,” and how do they “supposedly form the core of patriotism’s appeal”? What has happened to those rights because of the fear that Americans now feel, according to this article, and whom in the United States has this impacted?

e. What “self-appointed censors” seem to have emerged in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and why?

f. When, according to this article, was the last time that “a heartfelt and reinvigorating love of country [was] universally experienced in the United States”? When else in American history has such patriotism existed?

g. How, according to Gary Gerstle, is the patriotism that is emerging now different than that which surfaced after the Civil Rights movement and the war in Vietnam?

h. Why does “patriotism seems particularly potent and purely felt among the tens of millions of Americans who came of age after the 1960’s and early 70’s”?

i. How, according to historians, can patriotism be unifying and excluding, and why does “the (American) flag, as much as any symbol, embody the paradox”?

j. How have Arab-Americans and members of other ethnic-American groups been affected by the show of patriotism?

k. Why have some Americans reacted negatively to the show of patriotism?

l. What is the history of what the flag should symbolize, according to this article?

m. What events in American history stemmed from “a corollary of fear, with abuses most widespread when the federal government (played) a supporting role”?

n. What has the Bush administration done to attempt to combat “systemic abuses of civil liberties” that may arise in the country following the terrorist attacks?

o. What does “scapegoat” mean? Why do you think the article ends with the statement, “If the president is going to continue to insist on an inclusive kind of patriotism, home-front defense of tolerance could prove as formidable as the war itself”?

3. Explain to students that they will each be interviewing a person from their parents’, grandparents’, or great-grandparents’ generation, focusing on a time of national crisis or tragedy through which he or she lived (either in the United States or elsewhere). First, as a class, determine what time periods are included in these generations based on the age of their potential interviewees, as well as what events might be included (such as wars, assassinations of a leader, economic depressions and environmental disaster). Next, brainstorm a list on the board of questions that all students should pose to their interviewees regardless of the events they discuss. For example, students might ask about the role that the interviewee played in this troubled time (active participant in some way or bystander), what he or she remembers about the “facts” of the event itself (who, what, where, when, why and how), how patriotism manifested itself, and any negative impacts that resulted for some groups of people. Once a standard set of questions is developed, be sure that all students write them down for use in their interviews. Also explain to students that once they choose an interviewee, they should also each develop questions particular to the topic being discussed, which may involve some prior research.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students prepare for and conduct their interviews. Students should write down, as accurately as possible, their questions and the answers they receive. If they wish to use tape recording devices, they should obtain permission from the interviewees as the first recorded item on the tape. Then, each student should compile his or her interview information in a creative way — a classroom poster, a narrative or comparison/contrast essay, a children’s book, a poem, a brief dramatic piece, a piece of visual art, a newspaper front page, etc. Students should be encouraged to clarify factual information with other resources, if necessary. Allow students to share their works with the class or, if possible, with other classes as a museum exhibit entitled “Patriotism in Times of National Crisis: First-Person Perspectives.”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is a “symbol,” and what power does a symbol hold?

–What roles do flags play in organizations, both governmental and non-governmental?

–What symbols represent the United States to you, and why?

–What events or people in American history best represent the notion of patriotism, and why?

–What is “nationalism”? How is it similar to and different from patriotism?

–How do you define “American”? How has the “picture” of what an American is changed since the United States gained its independence? How did it change in the 20th century? How has it changed in your lifetime?

–What are “civil liberties”? What civil liberties are granted to all Americans? How are those rights protected?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, participation in class discussions, and thoughtful and thorough interview-based projects.

Extension Activities:

1. The writer of the article states, “for all its ennobling kick, historians agree that patriotism has almost always been at odds with itself. It reinforces a sense of community by erecting strong walls to comfort those on the inside. But outside those exclusive walls, it has a history of denying equal protection under the law and making life seem scary.” Support this statement with specific examples from the 20th century or throughout American history. Then, create an illustrated timeline, short book, or other informational resource based on your findings. You might want to refer to first-person accounts of those who have been “(denied) equal protection under the law and (for whom) life (has been made to) seem scary,” or reread the last paragraph of the article and include the concept of the “scapegoat.” Additionally, you might explore reports of hate crimes following the terrorist attacks on the United States [listed on sites such as the New York City IndyMedia Center (//nyc.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=11365)] and provide your commentary on the reports and on tolerance.

2. The article asserts that “a contentious and still unresolved struggle over what the flag should symbolize has been going on since at least 1863.” Research this history and create an illustrated timeline or encyclopedia entry about it.

3. What does it mean to be an American? Create a collage addressing your response to this question. Alternately, create a collage or other creative piece addressing the difference between assimilation and acculturation. You might also develop a guide to the cultures of the community in which you live, including important organizations that meet the needs of the various ethnic, racial, and religious groups that live there.

4. Write a biography for a person who you feel best represents patriotism in the United States, or write an essay, poem, short story, or short play about the theme of patriotism throughout American history.

5. Brainstorm as many emblems of American patriotism and history as you can, categorizing them under the headings of Symbols, Icons, Monuments, and Historic Places. Then, choose one of these items as the focus of research. What is the history behind this emblem? (Why it was “created,” who created it, and when it was created.) Where would one find this item? How has the meaning of this item changed over time? (What does this symbol represent or mean now?) What do you think caused these changes? Then, create an interesting and colorful classroom poster that traces the “evolution” of this historic American emblem and that includes all research responses. Alternately, investigate symbols of American patriotism and history in your community. Create a tour guide of your community that includes snapshots of historic places and things, the history behind the creation of your community, and stories about your community gathered through interviews of long-time residents.

6. Write a historical narrative about an event or era in American history from the perspective of a person (famous or non-famous) living through the events at this time. Include the “creation” or evolution of patriotic symbols in the narrative.

7. Investigate the origins and meaning behind your state’s or country’s flag. Create a creative guide or other presentation of your findings.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts – Learn about patriotic musical compositions such as the “Star-Spangled Banner,” “God Bless America,” “You’re a Grand Old Flag,” “Stars and Stripes Forever,” and “America the Beautiful.” In what ways is each piece related to the idea of independence? What was happening in the United States when each piece was written? What ideals does each piece present?

Global History – Write an essay exploring what patriotism and freedom mean in other countries around the world, including countries in which citizens have limited freedoms, countries that have become democracies in the past fifty years, and countries that were once under the colonial rule of another country. Alternately, obtain translations of the national anthems of countries around the world, and compare and contrast their messages. Include your nation’s anthem in the analysis as well.

Journalism – Create a photo journal showing displays of patriotism since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Try to include a wide variety of places and methods of demonstrating patriotism in your collection.

Mathematics – The article states that, “New York City, the erstwhile epicenter of selfishness and sin, has been judged in its time of trial and found good by more than 8 out of 10 Americans. Perhaps boundaries were melting between the Red Zone, the conservative heartland that voted for the Republican president, and the Blue Zone, where coastal liberals had clung to doubts about President Bush’s work ethic, his judgment and his intelligence.” Conduct a school or community poll about changes in views of New York City, divisions between political parties, the Bush administration’s and other countries’ reactions, and other topics since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Analyze your results and write an article for your school or local newspaper on your findings. Try to find other polls on similar topics to include as well.

Media Studies – Watch and analyze a movie about a war in which the United States was involved. From whose perspective is the narrative presented? What historic events are offered, and how is their portrayal impacted by the point of view from which the story is told? When was this movie produced, and how do you think that impacts the way in which this story was told? How are the people and views of the different sides of the war portrayed? How is the theme of patriotism explored? Write a review of the movie. If possible, find published reviews and compare your responses.
