''Break It Down,'' Lydia Davis's new collection of fiction, just out from Farrar, Straus & Giroux, gives us 34 stories in 177 pages. Half a dozen of these ''stories'' are no more than a page - or a paragraph - long. The one called ''Safe Love'' reads in its entirety:

''She was in love with her son's pediatrician. Alone out in the country - could anyone blame her.

''There was an element of grand passion in this love. It was also a safe thing. The man was on the other side of a barrier. Between him and her: the child on the examining table, the office itself, the staff, his wife, her husband, his stethoscope, his beard, her breasts, his glasses, her glasses, etc.''

As part of a larger narrative collage this fragment might help shed light on certain characters or a situation. And alone, it might serve as a good idea for a story, even a good idea for a good story. As it stands, however, it's nothing but an unrealized sketch, a free-floating bit of prose. Why then, one wonders, did Ms. Davis - who elsewhere in ''Break It Down'' demonstrates a gift for narrative complexity, an ability to capture and orchestrate emotional nuances -choose to include such flimsy pieces in this volume?

The thing is, Ms. Davis is hardly alone in publishing the sort of fragments that writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald used to relegate to their notebooks. Michelangelo Antonioni's new book, for instance, consists entirely of what he calls ''nuclei'' - that is, scenarios for possible films. Some of the entries in ''That Bowling Alley on the Tiber'' sound like newspaper clippings, describing heavily ironic events (i.e., some people go on a crocodile hunt and are subsequently eaten by their would-be prey); others are nothing but perfunctory descriptions of vaguely ominous landscapes.

In a sense, such ''stories'' represent another dead end reached by the Minimalism so popular in the last decade. Spareness of expression, a willful refusal to impute motive or interpret character, an inability or unwillingness to use the conventions of traditional narrative - all were initially strategies invoked by writers to portray the alienation experienced by a generation. And they were strategies that mirrored, in their very form, the post-60's sense of discontinuity and flux. In the hands of such writers as Raymond Carver and Ann Beattie, this approach could result in tightly controlled works of considerable emotional power; but at its worst, it dwindles into a grudging fiction in which the white space between the words and lines seeps into - and subsumes - the actual stories.
