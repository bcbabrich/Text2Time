About Real Estate Ruling on Dual Taxation May Be Costly By LEE A. DANIELS

A court decision concerning the calculations that New York City has used to levy taxes on a Manhattan apartment building during the Section 421-A tax-exemption program may compel the city to refund millions of dollars to developers.

For the most part, Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Alvin F. Klein's decision, handed down June 6, did not break new ground. Several other court cases in recent years had determined that the city had long erred in collecting taxes under the program, and the city has revised its policies.

But Justice Klein's determination in Trizec Western Inc. v. City of New York, unlike the previous rulings, did establish the time-period for which the city is liable for tax-refunds. The amount remains under dispute because the City is expected to appeal that part of the ruling.

This, in fact, is a key point that, for this one case, could determine how large a refund the city owes the building's owners. And, depending on how many developers of the 400 other buildings that were built under the Section 421-A program can prove tax-overcharge claims, it could have substantial financial implications for the city.
