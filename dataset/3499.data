HOLLYWOOD CARTOONS

American Animation in Its Golden Age.

By Michael Barrier.

Oxford, $39.95.

The best animated cartoons of the 1940's and 50's -- Walt Disney's ''Dumbo,'' Chuck Jones's ''Duck Amuck'' and ''One Froggy Evening,'' Tex Avery's ''King-Size Canary,'' John Hubley's ''Rooty Toot Toot'' -- are miniature masterpieces that can stand direct comparison with the silent films of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Such, at any rate, is the thesis of ''Hollywood Cartoons,'' and Michael Barrier, formerly the publisher and editor of Funnyworld magazine, makes a strong case for it, in part because he is so rigorous a critic. Outside of a few evocative memoirs, much of what has been written about Hollywood animation smacks of cheerleading; this book, by contrast, is a genuinely thoughtful attempt to explain what makes golden-age cartoons work, and why some work better than others. Nostalgia merchants may bristle at some of Barrier's more sharply drawn distinctions, particularly his shrewd analysis of the decline in quality of Jones's later cartoons (Jones's version of Bugs Bunny ''was simply too pleased with himself . . . he minces and flounces and verges on effeminacy''). But those who take the art of animation seriously will find this tough-minded book challenging and revelatory. Terry Teachout
