With Mr. Claudio's face smeared with charcoal to symbolize the toll taken by the previous year, the group accompanied the mule as it took on the sorrows and burdens of the neighborhood. And when they ended their journey at midnight -- hoarse, tired and tipsy -- they would burn the mula, their raggedy clothes and their worries, starting the year anew.

Theirs is the tradition of the parranda, a caroling party rare in New York, yet thriving in the snow and cold, luring old ladies to shout excitedly from their windows. As the carolers slapped hand drums and tambourines, the mule swayed down blocks lined with graffiti memorials, gated windows and empty lots. They dropped in on beauty parlors, bodegas, firehouses and homes, staying long enough at each stop to bring season's greetings, as well as receive offerings of a few dollars in an upturned drum and perhaps a drink to brace for the journey.

THE custom has journeyed from Puerto Rico, though it is fading there as crime has discouraged the carolers from their rounds. Perhaps it is more needed in the Bronx; the carolers know that, although they are far from home, buried beneath their sweaters, shirts and coats beat hearts strong with the rhythms of their youth.

"This is a seed that grows where we plant it," said Jose (Chema) Soto, who has led this ragtag group for more than 15 years. "In any country we're in, even on the moon, on the moon we'd take out the mule."

A few days earlier, Chema had finished sewing the mule costume inside Rincon Criollo, a wooden shack that is the headquarters in New York for the traditional music known as plena. Here, in a room lined with portraits of Puerto Ricans ranging from Roberto Clemente to Fernando Ferrer, the mule lay limp atop a freezer.
