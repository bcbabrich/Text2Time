DISCHE-Renate. The Departments of Pathology and Pediatrics of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University mourn the death of Renate Dische, Ph.D.; M.D. Born in Breslau, Germany in 1920, Dr. Dische received the Ph.D. in biochemistry from Columbia in 1953 and the M.D. in 1957. She served with distinction on the faculties of Cornell, Mt. Sinai, Toronto and Columbia. Dr. Dische was a pioneer of studies of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and a leading authority on pediatric cardiac disease. An outstanding teacher, she brought energy and precision to all her work. We extend our sympathies to her daughter, Irene, and her family. Michael L. Shelanski, M.D. Chairman of Pathology Gerald Fischbach, M.D. Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Columbia University
