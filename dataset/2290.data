My Saturday Off the Charts column, which pointed out that European employment is rising more rapidly than that of the United States, among men and women in the 25-54 age group, has drawn complaints from some readers who think the actual figures should have been clearer.

They are reported below. The figures show the percentage of people in the 25-54 age group with jobs.

There also was a complaint that the United States figures are understated because they exclude self-employed workers. In fact, because the figures are based on a population survey, they are supposed to include such workers. Nonetheless, there are issues that make international comparisons risky, such as the belief that in some European countries there is a large underground economy whose workers avoid official statistics to dodge taxes, or the fact that more Americans are in prison, and thus not counted as part of the civilian noninstitutionalized population.

But such factors do not obscure the trends within countries. And it is clear that the percentage of Americans in that age group with jobs is slipping, while European countries are either gaining or slipping less rapidly.
