More than 15 months before the opening of the 25th Summer Olympics, Barcelona has already decided that the stars will be the artists, designers and architects who are using the games to promote this city as a major European cultural center.

There is little talk about athletics here these days, but a $50 million program called the Cultural Olympics is in full swing. Further, a $7 billion urban renewal program preparing the city for the games is as much a tribute to sculpture and architecture as it is to engineering.

The message is clear: Barcelona is determined to be remembered for more than just three weeks of good organization and intense competition after the closing ceremony of the Olympics on Aug. 9, 1992.

"The Olympic Games are an exceptional occasion that enables us to mobilize exceptional resources," said Manuel Foreste, a spokesman for the Cultural Olympics. "We aspire to turn Barcelona into a cultural capital that forms part of the international circuit of the arts." Rich Past, Rich Present
