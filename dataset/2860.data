Sushma Swaraj, India's Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, said she would approach the Finance Ministry for the money. The Geneva-based Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria also has agreed to provide India with $100 million over five years for prevention, treatment, voluntary testing and counseling, although technical disagreements have delayed the signing of a final agreement. The fund's director, Dr. Richard Feachem, said that it was possible that more of the money could be committed to treatment to support the new venture.

But that reducing the price of the drugs would be critical.

Cipla, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and Matrix Laboratories -- now joined by a fourth Indian company, Hetero Drugs Ltd., and a South African company, Aspen Pharmacare Holdings -- recently reached an agreement with the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation to provide the drug to four African and nine Caribbean countries for about 37 cents per patient per day.

Under the agreement, the companies will increase production in return for a guaranteed customer base. The companies will supply the therapy to at least 1.5 million patients during the next five years, and the price of their raw materials will be pre-negotiated with the government. They will sell directly to the foundation or the governments, rather than middlemen, and be paid immediately.

But no such agreement is planned in India, where the drug companies say past efforts to work with the government have been frustrating. Ranbaxy has quietly undertaken to provide antiretroviral therapy directly to Indian patients at less than 90 cents a day in AIDS-endemic states. Cipla donates the drug used to prevent mother-to-child transmission in the government program. But at this point, ''we are probably doing more outside the country than in the country,'' Cipla's chairman and managing director, Yusuf K. Hamied, said in a recent interview.

Mr. Hamied said the companies needed to be able to sustain the manufacture of the drugs indefinitely, and to predict how much would be required. ''If the government wants to buy, they must let us know for how many, when, and do they have the money,'' he said.

For two weeks, the companies and government have been in what one participant called ''backbreaking'' negotiations over those issues. Ms. Swaraj has made clear that she would like the companies to provide lower prices in India than those agreed to with the Clinton Foundation. ''That's only natural because these are companies based in India,'' she said.

Industry representatives say the government needs to understand the business imperatives of companies that have become Indian success stories and wealth creators.
