Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, sued three immigration consultants yesterday, saying they defrauded dozens of clients out of $175,000. Pending a hearing in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, a judge ordered the consultants -- Angela Pasquino, Luis Cuero, and Francisco Morales -- to stop seeking clients, Mr. Spitzer said. He said the three, who operated from Queens, promised to obtain green cards for clients, but did not submit paperwork to federal agencies. Abeer Allam (NYT)
