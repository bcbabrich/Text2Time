Yet most Argentine governments have been staunchly anti-Communist and have supported United States attempts to fight Communism in the Western Hemisphere. President Roberto Eduardo Viola has publicly supported American involvement in El Salvador and a senior army general suggested that Argentina should send troops, though General Viola quickly disavowed that idea.

Since a retired American general, Vernon A. Walters, visited this capital four months ago seeking support for the United States policy in El Salvador the Administration has been trying to improve relations with the key countries of South America, particularly Argentina and Brazil. Sea Defense Is Issue

Mr. Buckley and others have said that Argentina and Brazil are necessary to defend the South Atlantic sea lanes. Tankers from the Persian Gulf area round Africa and move up the Atlantic narrows to Europe. But both Argentines and Europeans here note that several thousand miles separate the coasts of South America and Africa and that there is almost no international ocean traffic along the coast of Argentina and around the tip of South America.

The South American route would become more important if the Panama Canal were closed, but numerous strategic studies in the United States have observed that the most critical goods passing through the canal could be moved overland.

Moreover, it is noted here that even when relations between the United States and Argentina were at their worst during the Carter years Argentina was too anti-Communist to forge a military relationship with the Soviet Union. Out of economic necessity it has sold grain to the Soviet Union and it bought Soviet heavy water for its nuclear reactors last year. But there are no Soviet military advisers or equipment here, and even Soviet cultural affairs officers must get special permission for their activities.

Any lifting of the United States arms embargo is unlikely to result in a boon for the United States arms industry, defense analysts here say. The Argentines are already locked into long-term contracts with West German and French suppliers for such items as surface ships and submarines. The country makes many of its other weapons, such as tanks. Spare Parts Are Needed

Some air force generals here have raised the possibility of a $3 billion order for jet fighters to replace some of the country's older A-4's and its assortment of French and Israeli planes. But Government officials say that any such order is highly speculative because the Government is trying to cut its budget.
