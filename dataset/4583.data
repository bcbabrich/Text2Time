On Wall Street, there are staunch, powerful, well-connected Democrats committed to the party and to influencing the political process, Democrats able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single Presidential candidate. But some of them remain tantalizingly unattached. Call them the Uncommitted Committeds.

Paul Carey, the Northeast fund-raising director for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, rattles off the current list of uncommitteds: "Let's see, Felix, we've met with him; Ace Greenberg, still searching; Jenrette, taking a pass; Larry, pass."

Translation: Felix Rohatyn, the senior partner at Lazard Freres & Company is apparently waiting for Gov. Mario Cuomo's definitive decision. Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman of Bear, Stearns & Company, is said to be waiting until after the primaries. Richard Jenrette, chairman and chief executive of the Equitable Assurance Society, is not even planning to come in later, preoccupied with nursing the insurance company back to health. An aide in his office pleaded: "Please make that very clear." Laurence Tisch, chief executive of CBS, has said that as owner of a network, pledging allegiance to any candidate would be a conflict of interest.

Democrats on Wall Street are worried about two things. Bush can't be beaten. Bush can be beaten but not by any of the current candidates. "People will make a contribution, but there is less enthusiasm among the Democrats this year," says David Sawyer of the Sawyer Miller Group, a New York-based political consulting group. "They will go to the dinners and they will write the checks. But it isn't the same."
