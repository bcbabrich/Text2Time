As a special treat for readers of The Moment, the power gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin writes about new exhibitions in Paris.

Yesterday night was the opening of the “La Louvre – Paris” exhibition by Gelitin, the four-man art collective, at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (ARC). The Museum was packed. A fashiony and artsy crowd was hanging out at the entrance and inside the museum.

The group known as Gelitin, from Vienna, took over an entire floor of the museum. They filled the space that the museum gave them with more than 3,000 artworks, from big installations, to small pieces, exhibited from the floor to ceiling. Broken walls, toilets, photographs of men half naked, piles of chairs, pipes, stuffed animals, real birds — this is the world of Gelitin. A whole room is filled with paintings made with modeling clay: a re-visitation of masterpieces referencing Paris: La Joconde (Leonardo da Vinci), etc. See above.

A large band of artistic friends took part in the creation of some works. After being overwhelmed by the vision of all these works (paintings, sculptures, installation, drawings knitting works, photos.), I started to detect the smell of caramel and cheese, which were used to make some of the works on display. Cheese, like caramel, was coated on to a sculpture: the smell was very strong as the room was getting warmer and full of visitors.

The world of Gelitin could be defined as an enormous extravagant chaotic and proliferating universe. It is difficult to describe the work with a few adjectives. I am very enthusiastic with this exhibition and its dynamic, colorful, unpredictable and unique in its style. I was leaving the museum while a band was performing in front of an extravagant and flamboyant crowd.

“La Louvre – Paris,” Musée de la ville de Paris, exhibition on view from March 1st to April 20th, 2008.
