A park naturalist has built a smaller cage within the wolf enclosure where he has penned a half‐dozen Alpine choughs (pronounced “chuff”), jetblack birds with bright yellow, curving bills that are related to crows, but only half the size. Like crows, these birds are smart, and around the highest rocks where they nest, they fly like fools, stunting and rolling in small groups. The naturalist has to walk through the enclosure to feed his birds. and from outside the fence, one can watch him pick his way around the detritus of wolf meals: clots of lamb's wool, small heaps of bones, an occasional black cowhorn polished like onyx.

A few miles down the road, a little village called Opi sits on a steep‐faced ridge and looks across a deep ravine at an equally precipitous slope about 50 yards away. The naturalists want to introduce a small herd of the Abruzzo chamois on this hillside, a skittery surface of crumbling rock if this plan works, visitors to Opi will be able to park on the switchbacks across the gorge and observe the chamois in surroundings very similar to their natural habitat.

One morning before daybreak, with three friends, I work my way up the side of the park's Monte Amaro (Bitter Mountain) in search of a chamois.

The well‐marked trail begins at picnic site in the valley where we leave our oars. The first stretch of what our park map describes as a trail of “moderate” difficulty is gentle enough, an easy climb along a stream that runs down the mountain through a beech and maple forest. Foxes fresh out of their dens are busy marking their territories; all morning we walk through pockets of their scent, as rich and pungent as the smell of skunk cabbage.

Resting at the base of a tree, I absentmindedly scoop up a tiny, gray‐armored ball‐it's plated like an armadillo and its Italian name, armadillidio, suggests the relationship‐but this pea‐size creature is a land crustacean, and in the heat of my palm it begins to unroll, hesitates, and coils up tight again. At the base of the ridge, at treeiine, there are snowbanks in the shadows and brilliant purple crocuses nearby; on the way up we saw primrose and gentian. Two broadwing hawks plane over, one of them dangling a mouse from its beak.

A few minutes later we emerge from the trees and are in steep‐sided amphitheatens of grass and rock outcrop, just the place for eagles, choughs and chamois; animals that don't like to be surprised. We work along a ridge and soon see below us in an Alpine meadow ‐two, then five, then a dozen chamois. They're about twice the size of goats, with large eyes, contrasting head markings and thin, delicately curved horns. They know we're here, about 50 yards away, but they come ahead anyway, keeping an eye on us and finally stopping just below, to graze. They can skitter and dance across the merest of ledges; even though the grassy slope is steep, they don't dislodge any of the small rocks on the surface. Only the young kids show us any fancy footwork as they crowd each other off a large boulder, their tiny hooves clicking.

The mountains roll away around us, the sun beats down and we sprawl in the grass, mesmerized. We feel like shepherds.
