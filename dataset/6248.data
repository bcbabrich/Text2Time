The city's 5,000 unarmed auxiliary policemen — withdrawn from street patrols last Monday after attacks on regular uniformed policemen left one man dead and eight wounded — will resume their patrols tomorrow might, but in civilian clothes.

Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy said at a news conference yesterday that before going out on patrol again, to serve as the “eyes and ears of the Police Department,” the auxiliaries were getting two nights of instruction on how to patrol in civilian clothes. The auxiliary's uniform is the same as a regular patrolman's except for the shoulder patch.

“We're stressing safety and rapid communications at the special training sessions tonight and tomorrow night,” the Police Commissioner said.

He also reported that back‐up patrols for the regular force would continue. The back‐up patrols were begun after a patrol car was ambushed last Thursday. Two patrolmen were injured by automatic‐weapons fire in that attack, and two more in a second attack on Sunday. Policemen have been volunteering to work overtime —including on their days off —for the back‐up patrols.
