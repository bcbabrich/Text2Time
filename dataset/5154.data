Roberto Cossa's comedy ''La Nonna'' is sometimes dark, and often its humor may be too robust for delicate sensibilities. But in the production by Repertorio Espanol, the Argentinian writer's play at the Gramercy Arts Theater is very funny; the laughter it brings from the audience is gleeful and utterly unashamed.

Mr. Cossa toys with some dangerous themes. How many playwrights would risk making a 100-year-old matriarch a comic monster? There are rough ethnic jokes; people fall victim to nothing more blameworthy than their own innocence; calamities are made ridiculous. The play is a formidable challenge to a director and cast.

In this case, seven regulars from the Repertorio Espanol, under the direction of Braulio Villar, create characters whose absurdities ward off an audience's sympathy and keep the action moving so swiftly that there is no time for ethical reflection. And they do it without turning the characters into cartoon figures even though some of the pranks here put one in mind of the mayhem of Saturday morning television.

The story is simple enough: A family of Italian extraction in Buenos Aires is driven into poverty and desperation by its centenarian grandmother, who is eating them out of house and home. Her language is a hilarious mixture of Italian and Spanish, but she is easy to comprehend; every word is about food and she does nothing but eat.
