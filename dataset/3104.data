Investigators arrested a police memorabilia dealer yesterday after confiscating more than 5,000 authentic-looking police badges from his Yonkers home. Police officials said the dealer, Elliot Sash, 44, sold the mock badges, left, by mail for $75 each. It is legal to make and sell mock badges unless they resemble the real thing so closely that they could be used to impersonate an officer, officials said. ''The average person would not know the difference,'' Lt. John Zerillo, commander of the Police Impersonation Unit for the New York Police Department, said of Mr. Sash's badges. Officials said Mr. Sash had played bit parts in the television program ''Law and Order.'' Kevin Flynn (NYT)
