To see the Dictionary program that comes with Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 display definitions, press the command key and the space bar and then type a word into the Spotlight search bar; you can also open the program from the Applications folder. But like its paper counterpart (the New Oxford American Dictionary), the Dictionary program does much more than word definitions, even without an Internet connection.

With Dictionary open on your screen, visit the Go menu at the top of the screen and choose Front/Back Matter. Just like the front and back pages of a standard dictionary, the app has all sorts of helpful information, including a conversion table for weights and measures, a list of chemical elements and their abbreviations, a chart depicting proofreaderâ€™s marks, a grammar guide, a history of the English language and the full text of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution.
