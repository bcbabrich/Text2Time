The Sunday television talk shows examine what’s in store for 2011 as the 112th Congress rolls into town this week.

Let the battles begin.

The Obama administration is facing strengthened ranks of Republicans, who will be looking to harvest gains they made in the midterm elections. The president’s top economic adviser, Austan Goolsbee, discusses the White House’s economic agenda and how Mr. Obama plans to work with Republicans on ABC’s “This Week.”

Republicans have promised to make oversight one of their top priorities in the new Congress. Representative Darrell Issa of California, who is slated to take the reins of the powerful Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the Republican-led House, discusses his plans for the panel on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” CNN’s “State of the Union” and “Fox News Sunday.”

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, outlines Senate Republicans’ agenda on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Senator-elect Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and The Times’s David Brooks take part in the show’s panel discussion.

CBS also has Representatives Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota; Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida; Anthony Weiner, Democrat of New York; and Representative-elect Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania.

Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who will become the ranking Democrat on the oversight panel, also appears on CNN. Other guests include Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, Representative Jason Altmire, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and former Virginia governor Timothy Kaine, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Ed Henry, CNN’s chief White House correspondent, stands in for host Candy Crowley.

Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, the incoming chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, also appears on “Fox News Sunday,” along with two Republican lawmakers elected with the help of the Tea Party: Senator-elect Mike Lee of Utah and Representative-elect Allen West of Florida.

Former Ambassador Ann Wagner, one of six candidates bidding for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, takes questions on C-Span’s “Meet the Press.” The full slate of candidates is expected to debate on Jan. 3.

On Univision’s “Al Punto,” Representatives Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, discuss the change of command in the House and what it means for immigration and Mr. Obama’s agenda. Another guest, Jorge Castañeda, the former secretary of foreign affairs of Mexico, discusses pending elections, the drug war and economic rebuilding in Central and South America.

Also on ABC: Actor George Clooney and John Prendergast, a co-founder of the anti-genocide Enough Project, discuss the tensions building in Sudan. The country’s southerners are expected to vote this month to split from the north. The vote could rekindle a civil war that raged more than two decades until 2005.

On Bloomberg TV’s “Political Capital,” reporters look ahead to 2011.

Meawhile, TVOne’s “Washington Watch” looks back at 2010.

An earlier version of this blog post gave the wrong title to Pat Toomey. He is a Senator-elect, not a Representative-elect.
