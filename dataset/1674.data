Disney Theatrical Productions announced a new ticket-discounting strategy on Wednesday to boost sales for its three Broadway shows, offering a $15 companion ticket to any theatergoer who buys a regularly priced ticket this spring. The promotion will apply to “The Little Mermaid,” which has lost considerable ground compared with a year ago, as well as “Mary Poppins” and “The Lion King.”

According to a comparison of ticket sales for the first 13 weeks of 2009 and the same period in 2008, grosses for “The Little Mermaid” have declined about 29 percent. “Mary Poppins” is down about 19 percent, while “The Lion King” is off about 6 percent. By comparison, the Broadway musical “Wicked,” which also appeals strongly to families, is down about 6 percent for the same period.

David Schrader, executive vice president of Disney Theatrical Productions, attributed the drop in grosses to the recession’s impact on overall Broadway theater attendance and to earlier discounts for Disney shows during the winter. He also attributed the sharp “Mermaid” drop-off to its relatively strong sales last winter, when the show was a new addition to Broadway.

As for “Mary Poppins,” he said another factor was competition with other Broadway “nostalgia shows” that draw audiences with an affinity for an earlier film or theater version of a production. He cited Lincoln Center Theater’s hit musical “South Pacific,” which opened in April 2008, as one example.

Mr. Schrader said he wasn’t concerned about sustaining three major productions on Broadway without each one eating into the other’s potential audience. “When we look at statistics of people who actually see the shows, they are different,” he said. ” ‘Mary Poppins’ skews a little older. ‘Lion King’ is a little broader, pulling in more international tourists, for instance, while ‘Mermaid’ is much more New York City-metro-focused.”

For the most part the ticket discount is available for weeknights, when the three Disney theaters do not consistently pack in capacity crowds, and for specific sections of the theater that usually have scattered empty seats.

The discount is not valid, for example for Wednesday matinees, which are popular with children, or orchestra seats at weekend matinees and Saturday-evening performances.

The ticket offer begins at noon Sunday and runs through April 19, for select performances between April 21 and May 31.
