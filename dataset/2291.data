After talking about chess in my previous post, I have decided to continue the trend and not write directly about the extraordinary Formula One race that we all got to see today – at least I hope you did, since it was sensational, as Schumacher showed that he is far from losing his talent even as he retires.

While not present in China, I was in France for the go karting world championships – also organized under the aegis of the FIA – and I found it to be yet another interesting thing to compare to Formula One. At one end of the spectrum there’s a Formula One and chess world championship that seem to get out of control, but at the other end of the spectrum, karting is riding high…yet unfortunately heading toward the same exclusivity as Formula One.

In fact, walking through the paddock at the track in Angerville this weekend at the 43d karting world championships it almost felt like I was walking through a Formula One paddock. Same security, with a closed off paddock accessible only to the few with passes attributed, and with drivers so busy and deep in concentration that talking to them was almost impossible. Many of the faces were also the same as in Formula One.

“Karting is Formula One in miniature,” said Franck Lagorce, who was there as the leader of the team of French drivers.

And indeed it was. In fact, who should I run into but Nicolas Todt, the son of the Ferrari director Jean Todt. Nicolas is also the manager of Felipe Massa, and a director of the title-winning GP2 team. Nicolas was attending the kart race to watch over another of his drivers, Jules Bianchi, who was racing in Formula A, the highest level of karting. Patrick Tambay, the former Formula One driver, was there with his son Adrien. Former Formula One driver Jan Lammers’ son Bas was there racing as well. And I recognized one or two people from Bridgestone who are usually in the Formula One paddock, but priorities brought them to the karting track to take care of the tires.

(I didn’t recognize any of the engine people though, but decided I’d stick my minidisc recorder’s microphone out along the main straight and record some engine sounds as the karts passed. So you can click here and listen to the engines and practically see the karts pass before your eyes as the spectators did on the same straight pictured in the photo above, since the recording is in stereo.)

Finally, I should mention that in a way this miniature Formula One weekend turned into a “real” and not a “virtual” paddock for one of the readers of this blog, Pierre-Etienne Bost, who maintains the excellent blog de course. Pierre-Etienne and I met on Sunday for the first time, and spent the afternoon in the paddock.

And to round out the theme of the karting being all about the future of Formula One, some things work by way of the past as well. Pierre-Etienne pointed out to me that Adrien Tambay’s kart bore the same sponsor that his father’s cars did in Formula One: Moulin Rouge.

Like the Formula One race, the final of the karting world championships was raced on Sunday on a wet track. Just minutes before the start it began to rain very heavily and the race was delayed by five minutes as many drivers had to put rain tires on, including Bianchi, who was starting from second on the grid. It then stopped raining but with a soaked track, Bianchi got off to a great start and led the race gaining a massive lead lap after lap, just as Fernando Alonso did in Formula One in the morning. But Bianchi, 17, like Alonso, then found himself in trouble and on the fifth lap he was passed by Davide Fore, the 32-year-old Italian former world champion. He then abandoned the race on lap 7 with a technical problem.

Fore led until with seven laps left, another Italian, Francesco Antonucci passed Fore and won the race and the world karting title. It was his first world title, and he started the race on the fifth row.

As soon as Formula One has a boring race, it is criticized for being a boring formula. Often the critics say that the drivers should all have the same material and it would not be so boring. But today in this world championship kart race, the highest level of the lowest form of motor racing, there was no comparison at all: today’s Formula One race was much more exciting.

This is not to denigrate a three-day weekend of fun and exciting qualifying races leading up to the final race. Its 15,000 spectators had an excellent final race and a great weekend of karting entertainment – especially those who had the privilege of being able to go into exclusive Formula One-like the paddock. In fact, it wasn’t all new to Pierre-Etienne, who used to race karts at a regional level in France, and who said the paddock did not used to be so exclusive even a few years ago.
