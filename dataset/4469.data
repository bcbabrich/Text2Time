According to Mr. Greenwald, Tatra's management, desperate for sales after its market collapsed in Russia, agreed to send 2,500 trucks, or more than half last year's production, to Libya. The trucks were sent but the $52 million for them never arrived. With the help of lawyers, most have been retrieved from points in Europe where they were sent before they would have gone to Libya.

"The company got ripped off bad," Mr. Rutherford said. "But we've got approximately 2,000 back, and we spiffed them up. We've moved about a thousand of them."

More difficult for Mr. Greenwald and his partners are the deeper problems common to many manufacturers in the post-Communist era. Productivity is poor, a combination of too many workers and apathetic work habits bred by the old system. And while labor is comparatively cheap -- most Tatra workers earn under $200 a month -- Mr. Greenwald said this advantage would not last.

"We do need to get on with improved productivity and quality," he said. 1,666 Workers Dismissed

To that end, the company dismissed 1,666 workers last month. Three years ago it had 14,000 employees, or one for every truck produced. Now it has 9,000.

To get what he needs from suppliers, Mr. Greenwald has had to negotiate with Czech banks for $25 million so Tatra could pay its bills. Once the suppliers start shipping, Mr. Greenwald said, he is confident they will gradually shift to the more efficient just-in-time system of delivery, a side benefit from a recent investment by Volkswagen A.G., Germany's largest auto maker, in the giant Skoda automobile plant 40 miles northeast of Prague.

Already, he said, Volkswagen is working with Czech suppliers on just-in-time delivery, the system conceived by the Japanese and now common in Western auto plants. In contrast to the Communist way, just-in-time delivery lets parts arrive at a plant as needed rather than in huge orders that build inventory. Motivation a Challenge

Perhaps most challenging of all to the Americans will be motivating Czech workers and management, many of whom seem battered by years of Communism and the last three years of an unsuccessful transition.
