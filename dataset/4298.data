AS channel surfers glide through the airwaves of Storer Cable of New Haven they might see "Men's Christian Basketball," "Islamic Insights" or "Melting Fishbowl," a local arts program. Other options include "Live Pet of the Week," "Underground News," "American Atheist News" and "Healthy Child, Happy Child."

This offbeat range of public access television shows is broadcast by Citizens TV, or CTV, on Channels 29 and 33. Today it is adding a third public access channel on 28, as a result of rebuilding its system. The three channels provide public access, educational and governmental programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All their programs are produced by amateurs with training provided by CTV; the production staff is all volunteer.

The New Haven public access operation has been underwritten since 1989 by Storer Cable as part of a refranchising agreement. While all 24 cable franchises provide public access operations, only Storer and TCI Cablevision of Central Connecticut have sophisticated, independent studios, said Beryl M. Lyons, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Utility Control, the state agency that oversees cable television systems.

More of the remaining cable franchises will probably be providing similar operations as their original franchising agreements expire, Ms. Lyons said. "As these companies come up for franchise renewals, one of the things that we look at very closely is their commitment to public access," she said. "We're looking at it more and more and making certain that the companies are putting their commitment there." Dollars Related to Size of Franchise
