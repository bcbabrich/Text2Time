Nguyen Van Thieu, the former president of South Vietnam who led his nation through most of its war against North Vietnam until it was finally overrun by a Communist offensive in 1975, died late Saturday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center here, a hospital spokesman said. He was 76.

The hospital would not release the cause of death, but the spokesman said Mr. Thieu had collapsed at his home in suburban Foxboro on Thursday and was taken to the hospital, where he was kept on a respirator.

Since the end of the war in April 1975, when Mr. Thieu, like many Vietnamese, believed that his American allies had abandoned him, he had lived quietly, first in London and later in Boston, avoiding politics.

As a colonel in the South Vietnamese army, Mr. Thieu first came to prominence in helping to organize the coup that ousted President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963. He moved up swiftly, becoming chairman of the ruling military junta's National Directory, then chief of state in 1965. He won the presidency in 1967, beating the more flamboyant air force officer, Nguyen Cao Ky. He won the presidency again in 1971 in a rigged election and remained in the post until April 21, 1975, when he resigned and fled the country as North Vietnamese troops rushed toward Saigon.
