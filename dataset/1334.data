PHILADELPHIA — Just before ducking into the indoor batting cage Sunday afternoon, Jose Reyes spotted an old mentor he had not seen in five years, one who had a big impact on his career, he said.

The man was Bobby Valentine, the former Mets manager who was at Citizens Bank Park in his role as a broadcaster for ESPN. He was in the clubhouse to talk to Terry Collins, the current Mets manager, before the game, when Reyes saw him. Valentine went over and greeted Reyes, kissing the back of his hand, and came away with a huge smile, saying, “And by the way, in case anyone asks, I made him into a switch-hitter.”

Although Reyes was already technically a switch-hitter when Valentine got to him during spring training in 2002, there is some truth to what Valentine said because, according to Reyes, Valentine made him into a real switch-hitter.

“At that time it was still kind of new to me and I was struggling from the left side,” Reyes said. “I didn’t have any confidence, but Bobby helped me a lot. He really worked with me and it made a huge difference for me.”

It was on a trip to Fort Lauderdale in the spring of 2002, while the Mets were there to play the Baltimore Orioles. Valentine had Reyes, who had played only in the Class A South Atlantic League, come along on the two-hour trip. Reyes was 18 and had played in only 157 professional games, but his raw talent was obvious.

Valentine brought Reyes, who spoke little English, and the bilingual coach Juan Lopez into the batting cage in the Orioles’ complex and worked with him for more than an hour, focusing purely on Reyes’s left-handed swing. Valentine watched, demonstrated, explained and educated the young prospect.

“I took about 1,000 swings from the left side,” Reyes said. “He would watch me for a while and then say something and I would do what he just said. Then he would watch me take a few more swings and he would tell me something else. It went on like that for over an hour. I was sweating and getting tired, and listening to everything he said. It was great. I never forgot that day.”

Reyes grew up in Villa Gonzalez, Santiago, in the Dominican Republic and was strictly a right-handed hitter. Despite being very skinny, he would hit a home run in almost every youth league game he played in.

But about a year before the Mets signed him in 1999, Reyes began to consider the idea of becoming a switch-hitter. Learning to hit left-handed was a struggle at first. When he joined the organization professionally, it became even more difficult because the pitching he was facing was much better.

“It was hard, man,” Reyes said. “You just don’t feel comfortable, you know? You get in there and you don’t feel confident and then these pitchers are throwing pretty good stuff and you can’t get a hit. It’s tough, really tough.”

He said that after that day with Valentine, he took a new confidence into the left-handed batter’s box with him.

“I really appreciated what he did for me,” Reyes said. “I was very young and up to that point I didn’t have anyone like that who could spend more than an hour working with me. That was a key for me, it really was. It was very important for me to become a real switch-hitter.”

Reyes is still a stronger hitter from the right side, bring a .301 career batting average from that side of the plate into Sunday night’s game against the Phillies, compared with a .282 average from the left side. This year, as has occasionally been the case in previous years, is just the opposite. He went into Sunday’s game batting .326 from the left side and .240 from the right. Reyes is hitting .308 over all.

In spring 2002, at the end of his session with Valentine, who would manage the Mets only one more season, Valentine told Reyes he should be ready because if it were up to him, Reyes would be in the majors soon.

Unfortunately for Reyes and Valentine, it would not happen, and that is the postscript to the story. Reyes split his time that season between Class A St. Lucie and Class AA Binghamton, hitting a combined .288 with 8 home runs, 19 triples and 58 stolen bases.

Valentine’s Mets were so bad in 2002 that by the end of the season the principal owner Fred Wilpon told Valentine to manage the final week of the season as if it were the World Series, a test to see whether the players were still listening to him. Valentine said, “If that’s the case, then I want to bring up Jose Reyes.”

The request, which would have to have been executed by then general manager Steve Phillips, was denied. With Rey Ordonez and Marco Scutaro playing shortstop, the Mets went 1-6 in their final seven games and Valentine was fired. Reyes was finally promoted on June 10 the next year, too late for Valentine.
