Mr. Young has left stage managing and says he is now in a ''career crisis,'' working as an administrative assistant while he figures out what he wants to do next.

Although it has taken more than a year to complete the apartment, the major work took place over three months, and during that time they moved with their two dogs into a small studio. When they moved back, they were so thrilled by its transformation that all four of them ran through the new rooms.

The apartment is entered through a foyer that at Mr. Egozi's suggestion retained the lower ceilings, to make the height of the main room more dramatic by contrast. He also suggested using floor-to-ceiling doors in the powder room off of the foyer, ''to give a sense of grandeur,'' Mr. Odorisio said.

In their large kitchen, both the counters and island are finished in concrete, installed by Smoothcrete, a Canadian company with low prices that they found on the Web, and which works all over North America.

They love the smooth, cool feel of their counters, and the look. ''I love that it has impurities,'' Mr. Young said. ''People ask, does it stain, and I say, yeah,'' he added happily.

The counter includes a cutout with a top for garbage and a trough behind the faucet that holds pebbles and bamboo. Although it looks like the result of an aesthetic decision, it was placed there to keep water from dripping over the counter and to obscure the fact that they did not rebuild the window to make its bottom flush with the counter.

Keeping plants alive proved a challenge in a room with little natural light. The bamboo was the winner after wheat grass and yucca failed to thrive.
