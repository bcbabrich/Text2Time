To the Editor:

I applaud Gian Carlo Menotti for his brilliant use of Mozart to redefine ''artist,'' and particularly for his outcry against modern biography, which serves up gossip and scandal under pretext of enlarging our understanding of great creators.

But in combating that urge to unmask, developed by amateur psychologizing since Freud, that very frame of mind has betrayed Mr. Menotti into a related failing. He tells us that he forgives Goethe, Tolstoy, Michelangelo and, above all, Mozart for their human sins, because they gave us great art. Who is he, who are we to forgive sins - sins not committed against ourselves? And why should art absolve? or only great art? and Mozart's more than Goethe's?

This stock-exchange method of trading off art and morals de-grades them both. With unconscious arrogance, one arbitrarily bestows mercy on favorite artists and abandons the rest to their public fate.

Meanwhile, one stays blind to a small oversight: where in the biographical pillory and the esthetic excuse is there accurate and relevant judgment? Perhaps it is unnecessary. All artists, we know, are great sinners, whereas all ordinary citizens are free of oddities and lead sane and blameless lives. JACQUES BARZUN New York, June 10, 1989
