Nancy McCarthy, a former WPIX news writer, yesterday depicted Fred M. Thrower, president of WPIX, as inti mately involved with the pres entation of news on his station, calling during and after news casts to complain or make sug gestions.

Her characterization of the station executive was at vari ance with large segments of Mr. Thrower's testimony earli er in the WPIX license hearing. Mr. Thrower, under question ing by the Federal Communi cations Commission's lawyer, Pat W. Valicenti, had por trayed himself as leaving day to‐day operations to others. He testified that there were long stretches when he didn't watch WPIX's news.

Mrs. McCarthy's testimo ny, Which came on her third and final day on the witness stand, was capped by her pic ture of Mr. Thrower's concern, and by a recital of what she considered misrepresentations of news by WPIX.

Under cross‐examination by WPIX's counsel, John R. Schoe mer Jr., last Friday, Mrs. Mc Carthy admitted that when she complained of news distortions to Mr. Thrower at a confer ence in his office on Dec. 5, 1968, she had, in one instance, exaggerated. Yesterday Mr. Va licenti, on re‐direct examina tion, attempted to rehabilitate Mrs. McCarthy's testimony.
