A Federal judge said today he would approve a plan to liquidate the assets of the American Continental Corporation, Charles H. Keating Jr.'s company that was the parent of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.

Under the plan, American Continental's assets would be liquidated over three years to provide partial payment to the company's 25,000 creditors, who are owed $365 million.

More than 9,200 creditors participated in a recent vote on the proposal, and 95 percent approved it, said Donald Gaffney, a lawyer for unsecured creditors.

The plan was opposed by Mr. Keating and some of his former top executives, who invested in the company's securities. They said it would push them to the end of the creditors' line and make it unlikely they would receive any money.
