“We feel this is a significant day in Buffalo Bills history.” — Russ Brandon, the Bills’ chief operating officer.

Brandon was speaking at a news conference Saturday to introduce the two newest members of Buffalo’s revamped defense, defensive tackles Marcus Stroud and Spencer Johnson. In the first two days of the free-agent signing period, the Bills have been among the most active teams in an attempt to improve a defense that ranked 31st in the N.F.L. last season. On Friday, Buffalo added linebacker Kawika Mitchell, a former Giant.

“It was unanimous that Josh Brown was the top free agent at any position available.” — Rams Coach Scott Linehan.

Yes, Linehan is talking about kicker Josh Brown. This coming from the coach of a team whose offensive line last season was decimated, allowing 48 sacks and a bevy of quarterback injuries. The Rams apparently made an offer to guard Alan Faneca, but Brown was in their sights after Jeff Wilkins retired Friday. Brown agreed to a five-year, $14.2 million contract to move from one N.F.C. West team to another.

Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren was not pleased last year when receiver Darrell Jackson was traded to a division opponent, and he can’t be too happy to see Brown go to a rival, too. Brown was considered so valuable that Seattle used its franchise-tag on him last year. He was expected to be a top priority for the Seahawks to re-sign, and although they reportedly offered him $14 million, Brown said Saturday that the offer was backloaded.

”I was kind of nervous about another team in the division and I was like, ‘I’m going to get massacred by the Seattle fans now.’ But it’s all part of the game.” — Josh Brown.



Brown was not the only free agent to change teams but not divisions. After being cut by the Rams, with whom he had spent his entire career, Isaac Bruce signed with the San Francisco 49ers, who have hired Bruce’s former coach Mike Martz as their offensive coordinator. Bernard Berrian decided to trade an unsettled quarterback situation for a slightly less unsettled one, moving to the Vikings from the Bears. The Buccaneers signed Jeff Faine away from the Saints, making him the highest-paid center in the N.F.L.
