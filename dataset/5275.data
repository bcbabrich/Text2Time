Last Thursday Lilco agreed to sell the $5.3 billion Shoreham plant for $1 to New York, which has opposed its opening because of safety concerns and which plans to decommission it. Since then, state and Lilco officials have worked on an agreement to be presented to the Long Island Power Authority, the State Public Service Commission, the Legislature and other agencies for approval.

Officials said a meeting of the power authority, which Mr. Cuomo has said must approve the agreement, could be scheduled as early as Thursday. A power authority spokesman, Stephen Villano, said the agency's consultants are studying the agreement, adding that a decision by the trustees could come quickly.

In another development today, Lilco's board rejected the power authority's $8.75 billion bid to buy the utility. In a letter to William L. Mack, the power authority's chairman, Dr. Catacosinos said Lilco's evaluation committee - a group of outside directors -determined that the latest offer is ''not fair to Lilco and all its shareowners and is, therefore, rejected.''

Mr. Villano said the authority would have no immediate response to Lilco's rejection of its offer, which had been widely expected. He said the authority would ''consider its next course of action'' within a week's time. Legislative Approval Needed

Of all the agencies that must approve the accord, the power authority is the one expected to offer the least resistance. Six of its nine trustees have already expressed support for a negotiated settlement and several have begun to rally support for an accord.
