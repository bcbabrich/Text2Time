New York smells like many things, and some of them are good: freshly baked bagels, a beer and a dog at Yankee Stadium, the salt air that blows in on a summer morning.

Of course, many New York smells are not so good. Feel free to think of some of your own least favorites.

Though you would probably be hard pressed to come up with an official scent of New York, a state legislator from Staten Island, Matthew Titone, thinks he has: pine.

In a press release on Friday (and yes, we realize it was April Fool’s Day, and the assemblyman’s office swore this was not a joke), Mr. Titone introduced legislation that would name pine as New York’s official state scent. He said that while New York had the usual official flower, tree, bird, fish and whatnot, we did not have a state scent. “And that stinks,” he said.

Mr. Titone acknowledged that each New York community had its own smells, saying that his Staten Island constituents occasionally had to endure the odors of New Jersey. In choosing pine, however, he said he had found a unifying scent for the state, citing the pine barrens of Long Island, the Adirondack forests, and taxi air fresheners as his influences.

“The pine tree, like New Yorkers who are known for their can-do attitude, takes root where it can,” Mr. Titone said in the release, “surviving and thriving.”

Readers, we put it to you: Do you support Mr. Titone’s choice, or do you have your own ideas of what should be the state’s official scent?
