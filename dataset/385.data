ENTER RYAN FITZPATRICK

THE PUNCH

Not long before the Jets were scheduled to practice on Aug. 11, a team spokesman walked into the press room at their complex and announced an impromptu news conference with Coach Todd Bowles.

The subject? Unclear. But it was urgent.

Seething, Bowles revealed that Ikemefuna Enemkpali, a reserve linebacker, had punched the presumptive starting quarterback, Geno Smith, in the face, breaking his jaw and sidelining him for an estimated six to 10 weeks.

The punch, prompted by an unpaid debt, cost Enemkpali his job. Smith also lost his — because Ryan Fitzpatrick never gave it back.

As other backup quarterbacks floundered in starting roles, Fitzpatrick, on his fourth team in four seasons, flourished. He threw two touchdown passes in the opener against Cleveland and two more the next week at Indianapolis. Now, more than three and a half months later, Fitzpatrick is finishing one of the best seasons by a quarterback in Jets history.

Along the way, he shed his reputation as a caretaker and became the reason the Jets won instead of the reason they did not lose.

Fitzpatrick needs one more touchdown toss and 284 more passing yards to set franchise records in those categories. It is harder to quantify his intangible qualities: the calm he projects, the stability he provides, the trust he inspires.

His teammates wear T-shirts that say “FitzMagic.” They believe in him.

In the Jets’ tense December victories over the Giants, Dallas and New England, Fitzpatrick completed 67.9 percent of his passes (36 of 53) during the fourth quarter and overtime, with three touchdowns and no interceptions.

Smith has not pouted or bemoaned his circumstances. Had he never been slugged, maybe he, too, would have thrived; maybe not. Maybe the Jets would have still won 10 games; maybe not.

It is not a hypothetical worth exploring. They are one victory from their first playoff berth since 2010 because of Fitzpatrick, and they are better for it.
