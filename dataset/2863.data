Usually at this time of year, a debate rages about a certain bronze statue presented by the Downtown Athletic Club. It centers on what turns into a bedeviling question: is the Heisman Trophy awarded to the best college football player in the nation, period, or to the best player on the best team?

Until Miami rolled over Pittsburgh on Saturday night, 28-14, that issue was going to be argued back and forth until the Heisman ballots were due Dec. 10. No more. Oklahoma quarterback Jason White can book his flight to New York and bring an empty suitcase to take the trophy back home to Norman.

Any mystery about the race was removed after White's closest competitor, Pittsburgh receiver Larry Fitzgerald, had a frustrating outing against the Hurricanes. He caught only 3 passes for 26 yards, although one of them was an 18-yard touchdown pass that extended his streak for consecutive games with a touchdown catch to an N.C.A.A.-record 18.

Armchair Heisman-ologists can blame Pittsburgh Coach Walt Harris for a game plan that seemed to take his star out of the game: only two balls were thrown Fitzgerald's way in the first half. But the groundswell of late-season Heisman support he garnered was about something else. Fitzgerald has underdog cachet.
