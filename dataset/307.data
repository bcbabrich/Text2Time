His tenure has been dogged, though, by suggestions of uneasy relationships with some of his players — most notably Messi — and by accusations that his coaching style does not follow the elegant template laid down at Barcelona by Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola. His meetings with Catalonia’s ravenous news media have also been consistently fractious.

Enrique had warned Robert Fernández, Barcelona’s sporting director, before this season that he might not sign the new contract the club was prepared to offer him. Discussions over that deal had stalled in recent months, and it is quite likely that Enrique’s announcement that he would step down did not come as a shock to the club.

Barcelona now has three months to identify the most suitable replacement. Ernesto Valverde, the experienced coach of Athletic Bilbao, has considerable support among Barcelona’s executives as well as his own Barcelona connection: He won the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup as a player for the club in 1989. That his Athletic side beat Barcelona in this season’s Spanish Super Cup could add weight to his case.

Jorge Sampaoli, the coach of Sevilla, is the other leading contender. In his first job in European soccer, Sampaoli has turned Sevilla into a genuine contender for the Spanish title, and the expansive playing style he prefers is seen by some as dovetailing neatly with Barcelona’s traditions.

Sampaoli is also on the cusp of qualifying for the quarterfinals of the Champions League, something Barcelona — which was beaten, 4-0, in the first leg of its round of 16 matchup with Paris St.-Germain — is unlikely to do.
