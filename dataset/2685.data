Opera management declined to comment, saying it was still reviewing the lawsuit. "We will respond to it in an appropriate manner within an appropriate time frame," it said in a statement. "San Francisco Opera values its relationships with its unions and continues to look forward to working with them on these and all other issues." Ms. Vaness sharply disputed the union's characterization. She said it was common not to use typical contracts for such galas, and that the singers felt no pressure. "Every single person at that gala that I know -- and I knew just about everybody -- was there with great respect for Donald Runnicles," she said. "I even popped out of a cake!"

Some company members were also angered by Mr. Runnicles's pay. Tax documents show his salary for the 2002-3 season as $513,000, a 42 percent increase over the previous year. The singers and dancers said that earlier this year they had agreed to a wage freeze for the next two years and a 2 percent increase after that because the opera was citing financial distress. Chorus members also took a de facto pay cut when the opera limited extra weeks of work during the season, Ms. Heiber said. They earn $45,000 to $55,000 a year, which, she added, is difficult to survive on in San Francisco.

One chorus member, who did not want her name published for fear of retaliation, said she had no problem with Mr. Runnicles's earning what the market would bear. But many in the company, she said, resented his plea for them to make financial sacrifices without doing the same himself.

Opera house officials said Mr. Runnicles was paid more because he conducted three additional productions, for which guest conductors would have to have been paid.

Mr. Runnicles, well respected by many critics, recently agreed to a three-year extension of his contract, which would have ended in 2006. The announcement revived memories of his comments to an Austrian newspaper in August that he "would really have to think" about remaining in the United States if President Bush won re-election.
