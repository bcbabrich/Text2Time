A United Airlines Boeing 767 carrying 116 people went into a dive to avoid a collision with a small plane, passing within 100 feet of the smaller craft, according to a report received by the Federal Aviation Administration.

The 108 passengers and eight crew members aboard Flight 76 from Long Beach Municipal Airport to Chicago were not injured in the incident, which occurred at 7:33 A.M. Sunday, said Elly Brekke, a spokeswoman for the agency.

She said that the United pilot told the F.A.A. that he saw the single-engine Cessna in front of his aircraft, so he dived to avoid it, passing within 100 feet of the smaller craft, Ms. Brekke said.

Air traffic controllers advised the United pilot of the light plane's position, but Ms. Brekke said she was not sure what role the warning played in avoiding a collision. The mishap occurred about five and a half miles southwest of the airport.
