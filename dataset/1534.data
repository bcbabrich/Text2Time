Netherlands vs. Brazil

The Netherlands and Brazil, two teams that have subjugated their natural, swashbuckling impulses in favor of more measured approaches, meet in Port Elizabeth for this much-anticipated quarterfinal match. The Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg was singled out for praise by his coach, Bert van Marwijk, after making two crucial saves in a 2-1 win over Slovakia in the Round of 16 on Monday. But Stekelenburg’s job becomes markedly harder against Brazil, which scored three fine goals in its 3-0 win over Chile on Monday. Brazil’s defense, led by the team captain, Lúcio, continues to look impenetrable, while the team’s attacking stars — Robinho, Kaká and Luís Fabiano — appear to be finding harmony at the right time.

Uruguay vs. Ghana

Two young strikers are the main attraction in this quarterfinal in Johannesburg. Luis Suárez, 23, scored both goals for Uruguay in its 2-1 victory over South Korea last Saturday in the Round of 16. His superb play in South Africa should not come as a surprise to anyone who followed him last season at Ajax in the Dutch Eredivisie, where he scored a league-high 35 goals. Ghana has relied on its own young star, Asamoah Gyan, for production. Gyan, a 24-year-old forward nicknamed Baby Jet, has scored three of the Black Stars’ four goals in this Cup, including the match winner in extra time against the United States in the Round of 16 last Saturday.
