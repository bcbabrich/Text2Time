In the budding hollows of Appalachia, it is time to hear it for the H-word, hillbilly.

''It's a little paradoxical, but when you can laugh at yourself, that's a healthy sign that you can acknowledge a part of your heritage and be comfortable with it,'' said Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky. Accordingly, Mr. Patton, a Democrat born rural and poor, blesses this town's coming Hillbilly Days Festival as a measure of how far this outpost of Appalachia has progressed in creating a new image of itself.

The controversy that once attended the word hillbilly here in a place that was once the backwoods base of the feuding Hatfield and McCoy clans is slipping aside in the face of modern progress. Four-lane highways broke through years ago from the larger world, and the telecommunications and health care industries are booming the way mining once did. The first class of Appalachia's own students will graduate this spring from the Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine.

In this transition, the annual Hillbilly Days festival, which packs 100,000 visitors into this town of 6,500, has become Pikeville's touch of self-parody. People wearing overalls and carrying moonshine jugs parade around, making the point that the past is past and the present is better. The word hillbilly, once shunned as a contrivance of ignorant outsiders, is freshly embossed on the festival's special edition bottles of Coca-Cola. The bottle, bearing the likeness of a bearded backwoods fiddler, is already a collector's item.

''The old days of Lyndon Johnson's foray into eastern Kentucky to highlight domestic poverty are gone,'' said Governor Patton, an Appalachian native whose hands still bear the ingrained coal dust of his years as a miner. ''What we offer now is intellectual service to people around the world.''
