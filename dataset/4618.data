Max Roach Quartet

Max Roach, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at Perry Street, Manhattan, (212) 255-4037. Max Roach will be leading his quartet, featuring the trumpeter Cecil Bridgwater and the saxophonist Odean Pope, this weekend. The date's a chance to hear Mr. Roach at close range, where every note of his drum kit, from the muffled thump of his bass drum to the frying-oil sound of his ride cymbal, has resonance. Mr. Roach is one of jazz's great figures: his sense of swing is distinct, his contribution to jazz's vocabulary immense. Shows tonight and tommorow are at 9:30, 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; on Sunday there is no third set. There is a $20 cover charge and a $10 minimum. Flanagan at the Keyboard

Tommy Flanagan, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Manhattan, (212) 242-1785. Part of jazz's appeal can be its ease, the way complicated conceits of the imagination are translated into music. The pianist Tommy Flanagan does it better than almost anybody, his ideas springing off the keyboard. And Mr. Flanagan's sets are filled with pieces by Thad Jones, Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, standards in the jazz world. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 10 P.M., midnight and 1:30 A.M.; there is no third set on Sunday night. The cover is $15, and there is a $6 minimum.
