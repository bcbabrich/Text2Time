TAMPA, Fla. — So, the Pittsburgh Steelers have won a sixth Super Bowl championship, the first team to do so. What should we call this one? “One for the other thumb”? “One for the other index finger”?

Naila, in Tampa, and John, back in New York, chatted before the game, so to come full circle, here are our postgame thoughts:



John: What a game, Naila. Holy moley.

NJ: Didn’t look like it would be much of a game for a while there, huh?

John: No kidding. I never thought anything would trump that Giants’ win for excitement. But that might have done it. Kurt Warner really played a heck of a game. I think that was the sixth highest passing total in a Super Bowl. But doesn’t Ben have incredible nerve?

NJ: That was one hell of a drive by Ben Roethlisberger. Is it possible that Larry Fitzgerald is so good that he hurt his team’s chances of winning the Super Bowl?

John: Really. Good call. They scored too quick. I am so impressed with Roethlisberger, how such a big oaf can be such a good quarterback. And so mobile.

NJ: But did the Cardinals have any business being in that game? Would it have been a travesty had the Cardinals won, like some have suggested?

John: That would have been weird. But the Cardinals straight-up played a solid game. The passing offense really figured the Steelers out. The only breaks the Steelers created were those turnovers. They did not do much with their pass rush. It’s all about winning. Good teams are supposed to win those games. Really, the Cardinals outgained the Steelers by a lot. 407 to 292. That tells the story. The Cardinals might have blown the Steelers out if not for James Harrison.

NJ: And, well, if they hadn’t committed so many penalties (10 for 106 yards).

John: Ooof. Those three personal fouls were brutal. Just brutal. The Cardinals’ best defensive stars of the game making bonehead plays.

NJ: The Steelers were not doing themselves any favors near the end there either.

John: Nope. What do you think was the most memorable play. Holmes’s TD? Harrison’s?

NJ: Man, that’s hard. Is it going to be like Tyree’s catch and Plaxico last year? Plaxico won the game, but Tyree got all the replays.

John: You are right. I think you could make the case for Fitzgerald’s TD, the go-ahead score. He was gone in a flash.

NJ: Hard to top very large man running 100 yards.

John: I agree.

NJ: Let’s end with the question we started with: coach or stands? As a Steelers fan, would you have wanted to be here?

John: No. That is too much. I think you miss too much in the ballpark. And, anyway, I could never have afforded the tickets. I am going to get hazed for that, but I don’t care. I can do my own replays with the DVR.

NJ: I’m not sure we’re going to settle this couch vs. stands debate. But Super Bowl XLIII was the first pro football game I have ever attended live, and I’m not sure watching this game on TV, with all the chatter and all the commercials, will ever feel right again.

I would also like to say, I told you so: Santonio Holmes.



10:46 p.m. Dan Rooney, accepting the Lombardi Trophy, thanked President Obama before he thanked the Steelers fans. The president took the unusual stance of saying that he was rooting for one team over the other in the Super Bowl, returning the Rooneys’ support from the presidential campaign.

When he got the microphone for the trophy presentation, Coach Mike Tomlin was asked how concerned he was when Larry Fitzgerald scored on a 64-yard play to give the Cardinals the lead. He said if they were going to score, that was the way the Steelers would have wanted it: quickly.

“Steeler football is 60 minutes,” Tomlin said, and with that, the cheers from the robust, towel-waving crowd drowned out whatever he said next.

Santonio Holmes was the Super Bowl M.V.P., with 9 receptions for 131 yards, most of which coming on the final drive. He scored the game-winning touchdown, on a 6-yard pass with 35 seconds left. (That just happens to be exactly how much time was left when Plaxico Burress scored the winning touchdown last year.)

“I wanted to be the guy to make the plays,” Holmes said.

Asked what the play call was for the winning score, Roethlisberger said: “Drop back, scramble right, scramble left, find someone open.”

The field at Raymond James Stadium is now covered with silver confetti. It looks a little like it snowed here. Larger groups of Steelers fans are gathered around the entrances to the tunnels, still waving their towels and chanting, “De-fense!” They probably should be chanting “Of-fense!”

Some final stats:

*Roethlisberger: 21 of 30 for 256, 1 TD, 1 INT, 93.2 passer rating

* Willie Parker was the Steelers’ leading rusher, with 53 yards on 19 carries. He was a bit of nonfactor after being one of the stars in Detroit three years ago.

* Kurt Warner was awe-inspiring again, 31 of 43 for 377 yards, 3 TDs and that one fateful interception. His passer rating was 112.3.

* Larry Fitzgerald had two touchdowns in his seven catches for 127 yards, most of it in the second half. If there was a Conn Smythe trophy in the N.F.L., for M.V.P. of the entire postseason, Fitzgerald would win it.

*Anquan Boldin had eight catches for 84 yards, while Steve Breaston also had some big plays in his 6 catches for 71 yards.



John’s analysis from the couch in Brooklyn:

After the teams exchanged drives early in the quarter, Warner got the Cardinals back in a high gear. They were moving the ball like they had been in the second quarter, really, like you felt they could have been moving it for the whole game. The key play of the drive came on a second and 4, from midfield, when Warner found J. J. Arrington coming out of the backfield for a 22-yard gain. Warner finished it off with a TD pass, a picture-perfect fade route to Larry Fitzgerald. The Cardinals had cut the lead to 20-14. Just like that. They went 87 yards in eight plays (all passes) over 3:57. The Steelers took over at their 24, with 7:24 left. If they could have ground out another drive like they had in the middle of the third quarter, the game would have been wrapped up. But Roethlisberger took another huge sack, and the Cardinals got the ball back with 5:28 left. It was another dramatic swing. It didn’t happen as fast as Harrison’s return, but it was just as important. The Cardinals started at their 25, but quickly moved to midfield after a personal foul. A play later, they were inside the Steelers’ 30, after a pass to Steve Breaston for 23 yards. With about four minutes left, the Cardinals were driving to possibly win the game. Then it got dramatic. A holding penalty, then a tipped pass. Then another near interception. Then an incompletion. And the Cardinals decided to punt. This time, it was the Steelers saying, Whew. Perhaps not from relief, though. The Cardinals’ punt had pinned them at their 1. After narrowly avoiding a safety, Roethlisberger had a completion to Holmes at the 20. But the refs flagged the Steelers for holding on the play. In the end zone. And that’s a safety by the rules. But, really, the safety didn’t matter. The Cardinals, trailing by 20-16, had to score a touchdown, anyway. Two plays later, they did. Larry Fitzgerald takes a strike on a post route, in the middle of the field. He turned upfield and ran for a touchdown, watching himself on the big screen the whole way. The Steelers’ comeback did not begin well. A holding penalty put them in a deeper hole, if that was even possible. But it ended spectacularly. Roethlisberger, as he had many times in the game, extended plays with his lumbering legs. Starting from their 12, Roethlisberger pushed the Steelers to midfield and then, after an amazing pump fake, he finds Santonio Holmes. Pure speed to about the 5. An amazing play. An amazing drive. An amazing game. Two plays later, Holmes made a dramatic catch for a touchdown. At the edge of the end zone, his tippy-toes in the red and the whole crowd watched

him fall out of bounds. The officials reviewed the play. It was good. We used to do that all the time when I was a kid, in the streets in front of our houses. You’d purposely throw the ball so your friend could catch it like that, with his feet in the street and his body falling into the zoysia. The Cardinals had a final chance, with 29 seconds left. There was a flourish. Two completions. But a fumble by Warner, as he struggled against a withering rush, clinched it for Pittsburgh. In the end, the Cardinals’ stunning Super Bowl comeback came a few minutes too soon.

FOURTH QUARTER

The Cardinals were able to drive to the Pittsburgh 44, but Kurt Warner, trying to heave one last-chance pass, fumbled and the Steelers recovered to end the game. Wow.

4Q, :35 Ahem, Naila would like to say that she predicted a big game by Santonio Holmes. Roethlisberger and Holmes took over the Steelers’ drive, with Holmes scoring the go-ahead touchdown, on his tip-toes in the corner of the end zone. Holmes had 73 yards receiving on the drive. Roethlisberger’s pump-fakes did just enough to keep the Cardinals defense off balance.

But it should be pointed out that the Cardinals scored on their last drive in 21 seconds. They have 35 seconds left.

4Q, 1:57 Jeffrey Marcus reports from the below the stadium that four men with black Reebok gym bag full of “Steelers win” hats and T-shirts who had walked onto the field, just came running back through the tunnel. They returned with bags that said “Cards win.”

4Q, 2:00 O.K. maybe it wasn’t too little, too late. In the last 20 minutes, a dull, chippy, frustrating Super Bowl became a classic, the end of the second half mirroring in the end of the first in drama and twists.

The Cardinals have just gone ahead on a touchdown by, you guessed it, Larry Fitzgerald.

4Q, 2:57 Weirdness has ensued. It is now the Steelers who are committing bad penalties. A holding penalty in the end zone gave the Cardinals a safety.

4Q, 3:30 This place is all yellow towels right now. A holding penalty on Mike Gandy after the Cardinals had reached the Steelers 26 was crippling to what had been a promising drive for the Cardinals. But the Steelers held solid after that and stuck after crossing midfield, the Cardinals punted and were able to down it at the 2. A shoving match after the play led to an unnecessary roughness penalty, putting the Steelers at the 1.

Warner had completed 10 passes in a row, but misfired on three straight.

4Q, 5:37 How did we get here? Kurt Warner with the ball, down a touchdown with five minutes left in the Super Bowl? This did not seem possible even 10 minutes ago. Darnell Dockett has been a man possessed on the Cardinals’ last two defensive series. Another sack of Roethlisberger on second down was crushing, as the Steelers went three and out. It was a defensive stop the Cardinals desperately needed.

4Q, 7:30 Again, Larry Fitzgerald will catch anything thrown in his general direction. It may be too little, too late, but Fitzgerald finally is having an impact on this game.

Starting deep in their own territory after Steve Breaston was crushed on a punt return by William Gay, the Cardinals moved 86 yards in eight plays. The drive included four passes to Fitzgerald for 31 yards. The last one was a 1-yard touchdown pass in which Fitzgerald pulled the ball out of the sky. If this were basketball, it would have been an over the back call.

4Q, 11:42: Australia is getting to see plenty of their favorite son, Ben Graham. After getting a first down, the Cardinals again killed themselves with a penalty, a holding call that gave them second and 19 at their own 24. They gained only 6 more yards and on came Graham. His punt traveled only 27 yards.

After giving the Steelers another first down with a penalty, Darnell Dockett had two tackles for a loss, including a sack for Roethlisberger for a loss of 12. It was the Cardinals’ first sack of the game.

4Q, 13:49 A thought of James Harrison. On Monday, Harrison said he did not think he would rush the quarterback as much in this game. And lo and behold, his biggest play so far was in pass protection. But he certainly rushed — 100 yards for a touchdown.

THIRD QUARTER

John’s third-quarter analysis from the couch:

At the beginning of the third quarter, as the Cardinals tried vainly to forget about the most unforgettable play of recent Super Bowl history, they were, within minutes, nearly waylaid by another big defensive play. With Warner under heavy pressure on a third down at midfield, James Farrior knocked the ball out of his hand. But, after the review, the potential fumble was ruled an incomplete pass. The Steelers took over at their 18, and tried to turn the clock back to the early second quarter, when they stopped had a chance, after stopping the Cardinals’ offense cold, to add to a 10-point lead. For a while, it looked like they might deliver a knockout blow. Powered by inside runs from Willie Parker and helped by three personal fouls, two of them on the two Cardinals who’ve made the biggest defensive plays so far — Rodgers-Cromartie and Dansby — the Steelers rolled downfield — 79 yards in 16 plays over 8:39. (The third personal foul, unbelievably, came on a field-goal attempt, giving the Steelers a new set of downs inside the 5.) In the end, with 2:11 left in the quarter, the Steelers settled for a field goal. And the Cardinals dodged a haymaker. The Cardinals have spent most of this game wiping their brow and saying, Whew. The Cardinals’ offense has been able to move the ball, a little, but in short bursts, Dan Marino-style. They end the quarter with a second and 9 at their 34. The Steelers’ drive chewed up a big chunk of the third quarter. That’s how games get won. But, although the Steelers have displayed flash on defense, through three quarters, their pass rush has lacked a certain oomph. Only one sack so far. Over all, they seemed to be focused on the Cardinals’ marquee receivers, covering the downfield lanes. That left the flats open to Warner, who seemed to have an outlet receiver ready whenever the Steelers’ rushers get close.

The Cardinals have been undisciplined in this game and it was devastating on the Steelers’ first drive of the second half. The Cardinals had the eighth-most penalties during the regular season, with 98 for 816 yards. They have the second-most penalties in the playoffs, with 19 for 156 yards.

On this drive, Cardinals penalties helped the Steelers drive down to the red zone after starting from their own 18. Pittsburgh got three first downs on Arizona penalties, including a roughing-the-kicker after Jeff Reed had kicked a 27-yard field. The Steelers had a whole new set of downs at the 4-yard line. But the Steelers couldn’t capitalize (Roethlisberger nearly threw an interception that seemed certain to be returned for a touchdown), and still only got 3 points.

The Cardinals already have 8 penalties for 81 yards.

3Q, 10:57 Considering how discombobulated the Cardinals’ offense looked in the first quarter, it is hard to question now Ken Whisenhunt’s decision to defer after winning the coin toss. But Arizona needed an impressive drive to start the second half and it didn’t get one. There was another long review, this time to check if Kurt Warner had fumbled on 3rd and 6 from the Steelers 49 or had thrown an incomplete pass. It was ruled an incompletion, which angered the Pittsburgh contingent of the crowd, but the result was essentially the same. Ben Graham’s punt was not spectacular, and the Steelers had the ball at the 18 instead of deep in their own territory.

Some key halftime stats:

*Kurt Warner: 12 of 18 for 135 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT

*Ben Roethlisberger: 11 of 14 for 130 yards (His stats for all of Super Bowl XL: 9 of 21 for 123 with 2 INTs)

*Edgerrin James: four rushes for 10 yards, three catches for 26 yards

*Willie Parker: eight rushes for 34 yards

*Heath Miller: four catches for 47 yards

*Anquan Boldin: three catches for 56 yards

In case you were wondering, Hines Ward has 1 reception for 38 yards, on the second play of the game. Larry Fitzgerald had one catch for 12 yards, near the end of the half.

Dan G in comments asks what would have happened if the replay had reversed the play at the end of the half and James Harrison had been ruled down at the 1. Would the Steelers has been able to run another play? The answer, according to Al Michaels, was no. Harrison’s rumbling down the field had used up all 10 seconds left on the clock and wherever he stopped, the half would have been over.

John’s second-quarter analysis from the couch in Brooklyn:

The Steelers began the second quarter with a touchdown, which was an absolute must. Scoring is important, I know, but they had been inside the 5 about five minutes earlier and came away with only 3 points. But on third down, Gary Russell took the handoff and headed inside, following close behind the left guard. It was not a slow-developing play, but it took some pushing and shoving for him to score. That gave the Steelers a 10-0 lead with 14:01 left. The Steelers have shown the ability to gain tough yards on the ground when they need to. It’s true they were a solid rushing team in the regular season, but the offensive line has been a bit of a patchwork at times. The Cardinals’ second drive began with short passes, and a little sputtering. Warner had looked a little rusty. At least two of his first five passes were visibly off the mark. But he quickly settled down. After a holding call with about 10 minutes left in the half, which could have been a body blow to the Cardinals’ momentum, Warner — with three consecutive plays — announced his intention to stick around and play awhile. On the first play after the penalty, Warner responded with a 13-yard pass to Steve Breaston, basically erasing the 10-yard loss. On the next play, Warner found himself with plenty of time and he fired a 20-yard rocket downfield to a wide-open Anquan Boldin, who kept going after the catch and was dragged down inside the 5. Then the TD, on a fade route to the backup tight end, Ben Patrick. That cut the Steelers’ lead to 10-7. The Cardinals seemed to thrive on the energy of the successive gains. The offense went from stumbling short passes to vertical slashes through the Steelers’ defense. And they got an important foothold on the scoreboard. The teams traded futile drives, and then the action started. With under three minutes to play, after a punt that pinned them inside their 20, a pass by Roethlisberger was tipped high in the air and intercepted by Karlos Dansby. A hard pass tipped at the line became a gift-wrapped chance for the Cardinals to end the half with the lead. A preposterous possibility, to anyone who had watched the first quarter. Given the break in field position and opportunity, the Cardinals looked like a different team. They really did. But as if on cue, the Steelers’ defense trumped the Cardinals for the game’s big play. The Cardinals were at the 1, and then Warner threw an interception to Steelers linebacker James Harrison. Right to him. He jumped up and was off to the races. He returned it 100 yards, and was finally tackled as he slid into the end zone for a disputed touchdown. They reviewed it and reviewed it and John Madden said, “To heck with it, if he makes a runback like that, just give him a touchdown.” The refs did. Harrison was getting oxygen. He deserved it.

HALFTIME

Everyone in Raymond James Stadium was given a flashlight and were told to point it at the stage. Between the camera flashes and the flash lights, and the red light that has now enveloped the stadium, and the fire works shooting from the stage, this is pretty darn cool. If only Bruce could play “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out” all night.

Bruce follows with “Born to Run.” No surprises here so far. Everything is blue now. A snippet of the new single, “Working on a Dream” is next, with a smooth transition into “Glory Days,” with a friend who’s an old football player this time. The effect of the flashlights is fantastic. Naila doesn’t want them to turn the stadium lights back on.

SECOND QUARTER

The game changed dramatically in the final seconds of the half. The Cardinals got the ball back with two minutes left and moved smoothly down the field. Larry Fitzgerald made his first contribution to the game, catching one pass for 12 yards. On first and goal from the 1, Kurt Warner tried to hit Anquan Boldin in the end zone and was intercepted by James Harrison, who returned it 100 yards for a touchdown. Harrison, the defensive player of the year, appeared close to being tackled several times before fighting his way to the end zone. He seems to have learned something from Ben Roethlisberger. The play was reviewed to see if the ball crossed the plane of the goal line, but the call was upheld. It was the longest play in Super Bowl history, of course.

2Q, 2:09: The Steelers were not to be outdone. The Cardinals went three and out, going backwards. They started at the Steelers 43 because of Breaston’s punt return, but ended up at their own 40, thanks to two penalties.

But the Steelers were unable to capitalize. Ben Roethlisberger threw an interception two plays later.

2Q, 4:16 The Cardinals are pumped up now. After the touchdown, the defense came out on fire, holding the Steelers to six plays and 12 yards. Then Steve Breaston reeled off a 34-yard punt return.

2Q, 8:43 As Naila suspected, receivers other than Larry Fitzgerald were going to be big factors in the Arizona offense. But it was Edgerrin James who finally got the Cardinals moving. James had 27 total yards on a nine-play, 83-yard drive. Anquan Boldin had the big catch, gaining 45 yards on a play in which Kurt Warner seemed to have six months to throw. And Ben Patrick got the touchdown on a play in which Warner nearly fell down. It was the type of balanced drive that has been the hallmark of the Cardinals in the playoffs.

Alan Schwarz reports in to The Fifth Down from the concession line with this nugget:

So I’m waiting on line for a $12 bratwurst, and who’s in front of me but Cuba Gooding Jr. I asked him who he was rooting for, and he said, “Cardinals! C’mon! Rod Tidwell!” I’m embarrassed to say I had no idea what he was talking about – I nodded knowingly, thinking Rod Tidwell was maybe the Cardinals’ fourth receiver and a buddy of Gooding’s. Only when I got back to my seat did Jeffrey Marcus fill me in: Tidwell was the football player that Gooding played in “Jerry McGuire,” the one who yelped “Show me the money!” into the national vernacular. True to the character that won him an Oscar in 1996, Gooding ordered a turkey (sandwich) and a hot dog.

2Q, 14:09: At his news conference Thursday, Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin addressed his team’s struggles in short-yardage situations: “We found a guy in Gary Russell, who we believe has an aptitude for those situations. I think we’ve had more success since we’ve featured him specifically in those situations.”

The Steelers were facing third and goal from the 1. Who do you think they turned to?



FIRST QUARTER

John’s analysis from the couch:

I know it’s early, but the Steelers’ first drive really made an impression, if you ask me. On the first play, they came out with three tight ends, they bulled their necks and gained 3 yards on a run. Play No. 2 was a bootleg pass, and Hines Ward was wide open, crossing from left to right. A big gain, and early tests of the Steelers’ up-front power and of Ward’s knee: They looked fine from here. Of course, after loping down the field, the Steelers settled for a field goal. (And after I expressly told them in the pregame not to do that.) But 9 plays for 71 yards was a nice start. The Cardinals’ first drive made an impression, too. And that was of a wall straining to hold back the surf. There was a holding call, a fumble and running backs who lost their footing. Not a nice start. The Steelers picked up where they left off on Drive No. 2. Roethlisberger took a shot at the end zone, on a second down from near midfield. It was a beautiful, on-target pass, what I was looking for

from Roethlisberger. But the ball was tipped away at the last moment by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. The Steelers quickly shook off that disappointment. The play of the drive happened next. Roethlisberger, on a third down and 10, eluded the Cardinals’ pass rush for what seemed like a half an hour, and finally found Heath Miller for a first down. The Steelers showed acumen with short passes, and power in its rushing game. And they showed some calmness, letting the quarter run out with the ball snug in the red zone. They outgained the Cardinals, 140 yards to 13. Roethlisberger is 8 of 9 for 122 yards. A nearly perfect passer rating. Best commercial of the first quarter, Bob Dylan and Wyclef Jean Will.I.Am shilling Pepsi together.

“This is an especially exciting Superbowl for me, because I have close friends and family in both Pittsburgh and Phoenix. They are all telling me how excited and proud the two cities are to have their teams in the Superbowl.” — Adrian Childeres

The quarter ended with the Steelers in the red zone again. Antonio Rodgers-Cromartie saved a touchdown by tipping a deep ball away before it got to the wide-open Nate Washington in the end zone.

Roethlisberger is showing tremendous mobility. He escaped what seemed to be a sure sack on third down and passed for a first.

The Steelers showed a wildcat formation with a direct snap to Willie Parker, which wasn’t effective. But Parker has been gobbling up yardage otherwise. He had seven carries for 26 yards.

1Q, 9:45: Cardinals punter Ben Graham made his first appearance for his fans in Australia, where it is almost 11 a.m. on Monday. He said during media day that it would a good time for football fans in Australia to skip work. The Cardinals gained only 3 net yards on their first drive, hampered by a penalty and a fumble.

Judy Battista notes that the first tackle of the Super Bowl was made by a kicker, the Cardinals’ Neil Rackers, one of the best tackling kickers.

A colleague points out that after the apparent touchdown, Ben Roethlisberger did not do his typical “jump and bump” to celebrate. He jumped, but he did not bump. The condition of Roethlisberger’s ribs and back have been in question since he was speared during the A.F.C. championship game.

1Q, 5:15: Handing the Steelers the ball did not work out very well for the Cardinals. The Steelers did exactly as John suggested and threw deep early. Hines Ward was wide open when he gained 38 yards on Pittsburgh’s second play from scrimmage. Willie Parker had a good first drive, gaining 16 yards and had good success running outside.

It appeared Ben Roethlisberger had scored on the a 5-yard touchdown run, sending the crowd into a frenzy. But in an eerily familiar situation to the Steelers’ last Super Bowl, Ken Whisenhunt challenged whether Roethlisberger crossed the goal line, and the review ruled that he was down two inches from the goal line. Almost the exact same play was ruled touchdown for Pittsburgh three years ago against Seattle.

And again, just like John said, the Steelers didn’t make the small play. Mike Tomlin elected to kick a field goal, another questionable move to start the game.

John in Brooklyn said: Andrea Kremer is reporting that Hines Ward did some kind of weird blood-filtration treatment to get recovered from his sprained knee.

PREGAME

6:28 p.m.: Coin toss time. Gen. Petraeus will do the honors, with Lynn Swann, Roger Craig and John Elway looking on. Al Michaels says the N.F.C. has won the toss 11 times in a row. … And make that 12. Pittsburgh called tails, and it was heads. Arizona won the toss and deferred, which is surprising. A bold move, perhaps.

6:22 p.m.: Jennifer Hudson, performing for the first time since the murders of her mother, brother and nephew, delivered a fantastic national anthem. She followed Faith Hill’s ‘America the Beautiful,” and a walk-on by the crew of US Airways 1549. Chellsy Sullenberger may have gotten a bigger cheer than Faith.

Jerheme Urban of the Cardinals said last week that he was looking forward to playing in an open air stadium so he could hear the jet flying overhead. His first Super Bowl was in a dome in Detroit. He was right about the impact. The boom, the camera flashes, the waving towels, all make for an inspiring start.

6:16 p.m. Kurt Warner has just won the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. Seems as if no one else could have won. The other finalists were Brian Dawkins of the Eagles and Matt Birk of the Vikings. John says from Brooklyn: Brenda Warner is not wearing feathers.

6:14 p.m.: One difference between the stands and the couch: While Naila was watching an awesome marching band from Daytona Beach, John was watching Faith Hill sing what he described as a “some impossibly terrible song.”

The teams have run on to the field to rousing cheers from each of their fans, but Steelers fans’ boos may have been overpower the Cards fans’ cheers.

6:02 p.m.: Naila-Jean and John chatted online a little while ago with some pregame analysis:

NJ: So, John, an hour before game time. Thoughts?

John: Ready.

Oh.

Yeah.

One thing I want to bring up, before we get all bloody, is this: I have a serious quibble with the notion that Ken Whisenhunt worked some kind of miracle with the Cardinals.

The A.P., in its preview for this game, writes that “Whisenhunt quickly transformed them into winners.” Ugh.

NJ: Everyone says the pieces were all in place. People who worked there three years ago say that. Actually even Whiz says that.

John: Good for him. Only five — two in 2008 — of his 17 victories were against winning teams.

That’s like me losing 10 pounds and demanding airtime for an informercial.

I should say, though…

That he has presided over an impressive playoff run.

None of those games were cheap or controversial.

NJ: yep. He got them to adjust.

John: But let’s see what happens to the Cardinals next season before we outfit Whisenhunt for, you know, a cassock or whatever. …Is there one thing you are going to be watching for?

NJ: Believe it or not, the coin toss. I’m very curious to see what happens if the Cardinals get the ball first. If they can jump on the Steelers like they did the Eagles, it’s going to be tough for the Steelers.

John: That is an obvious point of friction, their passing game vs. the Steelers’ defense.

It’s tempting to say defense wins those battles, but Warner was in a similar spot in the 2002 Super Bowl.

The Rams lost that game, but only because of an amazing last-minute drive by the Patriots. For his part, Warner hung 365 passing yards on the Patriots’ defense, which was ranked sixth in the league that season.

NJ: It’s so funny to me now how Warner is being lauded for his quick release and his handling of pressure after all his troubles in St. Louis and New York with just those things. I’m impressed with that adjustment

John: I know what you mean. It’s weird that he has come out of nowhere.

What do you think of Big Ben? NJ: I think he’s tough kid. I think just like last time, he doesn’t have to have a great game for them to win. But he can’t be as bad as he was in Detroit either.

John: True.

NJ: I don’t think he will be. There has been talk about him being better adjusted to the special Super Bowl balls.

John: Because why?

NJ: Warner wears gloves now, so it’s not problem for him. But Roethlisberger has said he had trouble gripping the Super Bowl balls in Detroit. He might be wearing gloves tonight to deal with that

John: Heh. The weather won’t be a thing, though, right? You were saying it was chilly, but not football chilly. right?

NJ: No, just Florida chilly. It seems pretty calm and clear. Though one of the kickers said this week that it’s always a little windy, but most people wouldn’t notice it. It’s a gorgeous night, really.

How’s the weather in New York? :)

John: Ha. It’s beautiful today.

There is one thing I am going to watch for. It’s whether or not Roethlisberger throws deep early in the game. By “deep,” I mean a pass where the TV cameras have to pan way above the field, into the lights. If he does, that will be a sign that 1) Roethlisberger is healthy and 2) that the Steelers are not going to hunker down and try to bulldoze the Cardinals with Willie Parker. Furthermore, it will mean that this will be a more balanced clash of offenses.

Watch for the long passes. If the Steelers don’t try any in their first few drives, then the Cardinals’ job will be easier. What do you think of that? ..

NJ: Santonio Holmes seems primed for a big game. There has just been too much talk about all the other receivers. For the same reason, I think Boldin may be huge tonight.

John: That is a good point, too. Holmes and Limas Sweed are both deep threats, but neither have made big catches. There are some cringe-worthy highlights of them dropping the ball.

But, against the Chargers, the Steelers threw several long passes. And I think it created room for the O-line and Parker to operate — the Steelers gained 165 yards on the ground in that game.

NJ: Look at you with your stats.

John: I’m a pro. I did my pregame research listening to “Power and the Glory,” NFL Films soundtrack CD. Also, I was watching “Failure to Launch,” which “stars” the Super Bowl M.V.P. Terry Bradshaw.

NJ: That is being a true fan.

John: You want another stat?

NJ: I love stats.

John: Here’s a useless one: The Steelers have won two of the last three meetings. But they have played only three times since 1997, and the Cardinals won the most recent matchup, which was last season, 21-14, with a big game from — of course — Larry Fitzgerald (10 catches for 120 yards).

NJ: I interviewed a Cardinals fan a little while ago and he said that the Steelers fans had been very nice to them because, really, how could there be any pent-up animosity? They hardly play each other.

John: No kidding. And the Cardinals haven’t had the chance to annoy people by winning.

We should wrap this up. I have a concluding nugget.

NJ: I think maybe Eagles fans are annoyed

John: Wait, why? Oh. Yeah, well, them’s the breaks.

NJ: Nugget me!

John: Our boss, the venerable Tom Jolly, picked the Cardinals, and talked about how the big plays could be enough to win the game.

For me, I think the key for the Steelers is to avoid the little plays, drives that peter out and end in a field-goal attempt. That’s the way teams with good defenses and mediocre offenses die.

Just ask the Giants.

NJ: Well said. Can’t be settling for field goals against a team like this.

So one final question from me: How are you enjoying the view from the couch so far?

John: It’s great. This is the greatest day for a football fan, except for a few choice ones from my Husker past. But it’s great. I am happy. I am ready to start disagreeing with John Madden.

NJ: You’ll have to let me know if he says anything awesome. I’ve got to say, though, the game hasn’t even started yet and it’s going to be hard to top the view from the seats. It is outrageously loud already. But I can tell there’s a part of the field I’m not going to be able to see. Enjoy the game!

John: You, too.

5:34 p.m.: Anthony Vertucci, a longtime Cardinals fan featured in The Fifth Down last week, said Sunday he was so excited he could hardly speak. Don’t bring up Cardinals kicker Neil Rackers. It makes him nauseous. He doesn’t even want to think about the Super Bowl coming down to a kick.

Vertucci and his friend, Mark Augusta, who said he had been “brutally bludgeoned for 22 years” by the Cardinals, have seats near the pirate ship in Raymond James Stadium. (Did you know there is a Disney-esque “It’s a Pirate World After All” village behind the bleachers here? Well, now you know.)

Reader Comment “Steelers by 17 as I predicted 8 months ago, to their 6th record Super Bowl victory, and the start of a new dynasty!” — Walter Boehme

They were surprised just how many other Cardinals fans were in town, spending last night with 500 of them at the unofficial Cardinals bar in Tampa, Wings Gone Wild. Every Cardinals fan who passed by on the concourse at Raymond James was a new friend. Or an old one. Vertucci pointed to a man in a red suit and a red wig. He said he’d known the man for years from Cardinals fans message boards and chat rooms, but he wouldn’t have met him in person if Arizona hadn’t made the Super Bowl.

As he talked, a Cards fan would come up for a high five, others would chat. Vertucci has been a Cardinals fan for his whole life, for nearly 45 years. But Joe Giancolo had him beat. Born in St. Louis in 1963, Giancolo said the Cardinals were the only football team he had ever followed. The team moved to Phoenix in 1988; he moved there in 1990. Giancolo and his friends, all dressed in red, said the stars were aligned; it was their team’s destiny to win.

“We’re few, but we’re proud,” Augusta said.

5:15 p.m.: Seen on the concourse at Raymond James Stadium: Jon Gruden being surrounded by Steelers fans. A man, Kevin Salvagni, in a T-shirt that was half Kurt Warner jersey, half Ben Roethlisberger, with the name Warnberger and 17 on the back. A Tampa resident, Salvagni wasn’t rooting for a team. He was rooting for offense. His shirt intrigued Marc Johnson of Atlanta, who stopped to talk. Wearing a Tommy Maddox Steelers jersey, Johnson said this was his 17th Super Bowl. But he had not seen his own favorite teams in one. He is a Chiefs and Lions fan. So he had a tough year. He figured it would be five years before the Chiefs would be in a Super Bowl. And the Lions? “55 years,” Johnson said.

4:22 p.m.: As (Not) Journey performed “(Don’t Stop) Believin'” at the tailgate concert outside, two nuns passed by wearing Cardinals gear. Then Kurt Warner came running down the field toward the large section of Cardinals fans, bringing another roar.

Reader Comment “In fact there’s little to celebrate about the Super Bowl because the NFL ultimately denies freedom to the millions of Americans who will be watching today.” — bmeisen

But that ovation was countered with shouting and towel waving for Ben Roethlisberger, who emerged on the field for a jog shortly after.

4:14 p.m.: A rousing “Let’s Go Cardinals” chant just erupted from section 106, directly in front of the auxiliary press tables. It is one of the few places in the stadium at the moment where Cardinals fans outnumber Steelers fans. All week long, not surprisingly, Steelers jerseys were far more prevalent than Cardinals one.

4:02 p.m.: Steelers kicker Jeff Reed was perhaps the first player on the field at Raymond James Stadium and his jog around caused the few Steelers already in their seats to set their Terrible Towels a-twirlin’.

Reed was a popular interview in the week leading up to the game, his bleached blond hair eliciting as many questions about his style as Troy Polamalu and Larry Fitzgerald got.

But the cheer Reed got was nothing compared to the roar that went up when Hines Ward, his knee the subject of the most questions of the week, did a lap around the field.

3:35 p.m.: Earlier this week, we asked if you would rather watch the Super Bowl from the stands or from the couch. Watching from home is the leader for now, 7-5. But The Fifth Down is going to put the question to the test on the big day. Naila-Jean Meyers will be writing from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, while John Woods is getting cozy on his couch in Brooklyn. We will be offering live analysis (though not complete play-by-play, as the N.F.L. does not allow it on site) and give you a little flavor from each of our experiences.

Have you made your predictions yet? 57 percent of the 7,500 voters on the Point/Counterpoint feature have chosen the Steelers.
