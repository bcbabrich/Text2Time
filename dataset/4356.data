Acting over the objections of 11 of the defendants, a Federal judge yesterday postponed for more than two months the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 12 other men accused of conspiring to wage a war of urban terrorism against the United States.

Judge Michael B. Mukasey, who is presiding in the case, set a new trial date of Dec. 5 to give time to newly appointed lawyers to prepare their cases for the defense.

Judge Mukasey's decision was made necessary in part by his disqualification last week of the firm of William M. Kunstler and Ronald L. Kuby from defending their remaining client in the trial, Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny. The judge accepted a Government motion to disqualify the Kunstler & Kuby firm on the grounds that they had a conflict of interest.

Mr. Elgabrowny has engaged a new defense lawyer, Anthony Ricco, who last week told Judge Mukasey that he would need two or three months to prepare his case. Concern About Trial Speed
