The ''L'' word wasn't dirty in at least one place last night - the annual Liberal Party dinner.

Governor Cuomo told up to 700 Democrats and Liberals that ''liberalism properly understood is not just consistent with the American idea; liberalism properly understood is the American idea.''

The Governor was attending his first Liberal Party dinner in several years after a rapprochement with the party leadership. He made an unusually serious speech for such a noisy political dinner, attacking ''the grubby campaign of slander that the Republicans have waged trying to fool the American people.'' He assailed the Republicans for ''cheap efforts to distort'' liberalism.

With Republican distortions, he said, ''freedom means permissiveness, liberty means license, privacy is pornography, progress becomes chaos, government means intrusion and conciliation means weakness.'' 'Celebrating the Liberal Policies'

The Governor echoed other speakers, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Arthur Schlesinger, the historian, and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, in ''celebrating the liberal policies that have made this country great,'' in the words of Fran Reiter, vice chairman of the Liberal Party.
