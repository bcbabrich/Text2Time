The regional government of Berlin decided to ban the wearing of visible religious symbols by civil servants. Under the decision, to go into effect this summer, police officers, firefighters, judges, court officers and public school teachers are prohibited from wearing Muslim head scarves, Jewish skullcaps and large Christian crosses on the job. Berlin is the sixth of Germany's 16 states to ban the wearing of such symbols by civil servants. Kirsten Grieshaber (NYT)
