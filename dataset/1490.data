Introduced on Wednesday: 2011 Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid

What is it? A hybrid substitute for green acceleration junkies. Redesigned inside and out, the Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid is capable of running on gas, electric or both and reaching a top speed of 150 miles per hour.

Is it real? Is it ever. Porsche is expanding its portfolio (now the largest the company has ever offered) and, yes, they keep hinting that the Porsche 918 Spyder Hybrid will become a reality, too.

What they said: “The challenge was to come up with a new system that was credible,” explained Detlev von Platen, chief executive of Porsche Cars North America. In other words, the company recognized that simply tacking on an electric motor to a high-performance car would draw the same kind of derision some early luxury hybrids received. Mr. Platen noted that the hybrid is lighter (by 400 pounds) yet includes an added 150 pounds of safety related equipment (not to mention the added weight of the battery under the back end). The car is 40 percent more fuel efficient than today’s Cayenne S.

The car will go from a standing start up to 35 miles per hour before seeking help from the gas engine. However, by decoupling the engine from the electric motor via a nifty new transmission, the Cayenne S Hybrid allows drivers to switch off the gas engine and run on pure electricity while cruising down the highway, er, autobahn at up to 97 miles per hour. Given the almost total absence of engine noise in such a situation, Porsche engineers call it “sailing.” We’d call it an adrenaline rush.

What they didn’t say: While the decoupler may be revolutionary, the basic components of the electric motor and battery are not. It uses a nickel-metal hydride battery, for example, rather than the next-gen lithium-ion battery. (Martin Bratzler, the Cayenne project manager, noted that using lithium-ion batteries could save the vehicle additional weight, but the company didn’t feel they were reliable and durable enough yet.)

Still pending is a fuel economy rating for the new models. But the sister to the Cayenne — the Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid — is expected to have a combined fuel economy rating of about 26 miles per gallon. One wonders how many buyers will in fact choose the Tourareg Hybrid over the Cayenne S Hybrid.

Finally, people will still be lusting after the Turbo model. The zero-to-60 time is 6.1 seconds on the hybrid compared with 4.4 seconds for the 500-horsepower turbo.

What makes it tick? The permanent all-wheel-drive S.U.V. has a supercharged, 3-liter V-6 with a 47-horsepower electric motor and an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. The whole package tops out at 380 horsepower.

How much? How soon? Not as expensive as you might think. Expected to arrive in North America late this year, the Cayenne S Hybrid will be $67,700. That’s considerably less than the Turbo’s $104,800 sticker price, but much more than the base price of $46,700 for the conventional 6-cylinder model.

How’s it look? More slipstream than the previous Cayenne with a sharklike front-end that from certain angles is almost indiscernible from the Panamera. Although it looks lower and smaller than its predecessor, it is in fact a few millimeters higher off the ground and 1.9-inches longer and 1.6-inches wider. It’s certainly sexier than the similarly spec’d, but blunt-nosed Touareg. But the question remains: Can one really lust after a hybrid?
