But getting rid of a big distortion requires a bigger tax cut than getting rid of a small one. Thanks to all those tax-sheltered accounts, exempting dividend income from individual taxes could cost only half as much as making companies' dividend payments tax-deductible. Exempting only part of the dividend from taxation, as the Bush administration is expected to propose, would cost the Treasury even less. And most policy makers would rather keep the money in Washington.

Giving individual investors a break on their dividend income already subjects politicians to demagogic attacks as friends of the rich. Cutting corporate taxes, even to eliminate distortions, is politically dangerous.

In a campaign, ''my opponent supported tax breaks for giant corporations'' is even nastier than ''my opponent supported tax breaks for wealthy investors.'' Sounder tax policy hardly seems worth the trouble.

The second good idea gone bad is cutting the payroll tax, which takes 6.2 percent of everyone's paycheck from the first dollar of income up to a limit, set in 2002 at $84,900. Employers pay an equal amount for the privilege of employing people. The employer tax does not show up on the FICA line of your pay stub, but it nonetheless increases the gap between what you take home and what you cost the company.

Reducing the payroll tax would give every worker an immediate tax break and encourage companies to hire (or retain) employees. It's a winning idea whether you're looking for a Keynesian jolt to consumer spending or a supply-side boost to hiring. And it would particularly benefit low-income workers, who pay little or nothing in federal income taxes but still owe payroll taxes.

The problem arises in defining what it means to ''cut the payroll tax.'' A permanent rate reduction, the ideal reform, is not what lawmakers have in mind. The most common suggestion is a one-year exemption on the first $10,000 or $15,000 of income. This idea has two problems.

To spur either spending or long-term hiring, income tax cuts need to be permanent, not short term.

Of course, employers and workers would appreciate even a one-year break, especially a large one. The idea is a political winner, but a temporary cut does little to encourage hiring or spending.
