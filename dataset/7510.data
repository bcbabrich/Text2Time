LONDON, Oct. 31—Joe Gri­mond, leader of the Liberal party, specified today for the first time the areas where the Labor Government could count on Liberal support in the new Parliament.

At the same time, lhe ruled out the possibility of a Liberal­Labor alliance. Most of the talk about a pact, he said, seems to come from a “too vivid imagina­tion of the Liberals themselves.”

Addressing a special meeting of the Liberal party council in London, Mr. Grimond said Lib­erals should find it possible to support the Government on legal reforms, the social services and, “if the Labor party will tackle it,” the whole question of indus­trial relations and restrictive practices by unions.

He specifically excluded steel nationalization. Despite its slim five‐seat over‐all majority, the Labor Government plans to try to get a steel na ionalization bill through the next Parlia­ment.
