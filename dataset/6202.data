“It was just the beginning of the migrating season when this happened,” Mr. Best said, “so we had to shoo away other ducks who tried to land on the lake for the next few days.

Subsequent rains have cleared the lake enought so that other migrating birds have landed safely.

“But they don't stay for long because there are no fish there for them to eat,” Mr. Best said.

Dead Fish Removed

“We cleaned out all the dead fish,” Mr. Jaffe said, “and we vacuumed with skimmer.” As for replenishing the fish supply in the lake, he said:

“We're going to get a biologist to test the water and the lake bottom to see if new fish can live there now.”

Mr. Potash said that Scher Brothers was “assuming that we're responsible for some shampoo base getting in there in small amounts, but we have no proof one way or the other. We diked off the area.”

Mr. Jaffe confirmed that the company has sealed its outlet into McDonald Brook, which begins in Morris County and meanders through several communities, including Clifton, before flowing into Hughes Lake.

“We're in a process, through a community development grant, to divert the brook water past the lake and let it be fed by the nearby springs,” he said. “Or else, we will skim the pollutants and pump them out so that this won't happen again.”

As of two weeks ago, Mr. Best said, “We still smelled the pollutant, and so we had a meeting to look into the problem.”
