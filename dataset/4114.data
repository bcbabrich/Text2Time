Mark Everett's credentials as a runner are superb.

He has five national outdoor titles in the last seven years at 800 meters and two national titles indoors in the last three years at 500 meters. He is the third-fastest American ever at 800 meters (1 minute 43.40 seconds) behind Johnny Gray (1:42.60) and David Mack (1:43.25). And he is ranked third in the world in the 800 behind only Wilson Kipketer and Patrick Konchellah, both of Kenya.

Yet, when Everett steps to the line for the men's 800 in the Chemical Bank Millrose Games on Friday at Madison Square Garden, many people may not remember him, despite his six Millrose titles (three at 500 meters, three at 600 yards) in six races. Everett, however, may be recalled for the races in which he finished far behind less-gifted runners, the races in which he seemed unfocused and uncaring.

Everett says he understands. He also says the 26-year-old Mark Everett you see now is different.

"I'm older and wiser," he said last week. "I have a coach now, J. J. Clark. I got married in October, which helps a lot. Everybody knows that when you marry, it stabilizes you, or tears you up a lot."

The one who tore him up in the past was himself. Often, Everett would lope far back, then roar past rivals who had written him off. And his unsophisticated tactics (or lack of tactics) made him look bad even when he succeeded.
