To the Editor:

Professor Tuerkheimer (letter, Feb. 14) has not persuaded me that the grand jury acted properly in dismissing the case against Bernhard Goetz. The grand jury's purpose is to protect the innocent from groundless prosecution, and its secondary function is to economize on court resources.

There are indeed grounds to prosecute Bernhard Goetz. He shot four people, two in the back, with a weapon he knew it was illegal to carry. The court's time is not wasted in determining the guilt or innocence of the five parties to the incident.

A grand jury hearing is less of a venue than a courtroom trial. It's abbreviated, it's pro forma; in some cases, it's perfunctory. It is not an appropriate venue for resolving issues that command national attention.

I am not cheered that the Goetz case was handled expeditiously. If the courts are overburdened, it is no victory that they are spared something as messy as the Goetz case. Mr. Goetz now stands accused only of having had the gun, not of shooting it. That's not justice; it's legal flimflammery.
