Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students investigate the role of mathematics in their everyday lives. They then discover, through reading a Times article and through analyzing a specific example of art, that mathematics exists on a deeper ‘metaphoric’ level in art.



Author(s):

Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. List and discuss all that they do on a daily basis that involves mathematics, both on obvious and more hidden levels.

2. Read and discuss “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction.”

3. Relate a mathematical concept metaphorically to a piece of art.

Resources / Materials:

paper

pens/ pencils

copies of “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students list all the things that they do that involve mathematics. Students then share their lists with the class as the teacher writes suggestions on the board. Students then add to the class list by brainstorming other daily tasks or chores that involve mathematics.



2. Read the article “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” and discuss the following questions:

–The author of this piece argues that “Good Will Hunting” is not a movie about math just because much of the plot revolves around a mathematical genius. How does he support this argument? What stereotypes about mathematicians does he feel are promoted by the movie?

–In what way does the movie “Sliding Doors” relate to mathematical concepts?

–How does Chuck Close’s art retrospective incorporate mathematics?

–How does the novel “Larry’s Party” relate to mathematical concepts?

–What does the writer mean when he says that “mathematics, like beauty, is more than skin-deep”?



3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students search for mathemetical metaphors in favorite books, stories, art pieces, music, movies, or television shows. Students choose one of these examples and describe in writing the mathematical concept or theory it expresses. Teachers may need to help younger students with creating such metaphoric comparisons.

Further Questions for Discussion:

What are some examples of stereotypes about mathematicians and people who are interested in and good at doing math? How do movies and television promote these stereotypes?

How does math apply to the profession that you want to pursue?

What are some examples of mathematics employed in music?

What are some examples of mathematics employed in dance?

What is the relevance of mathematics in your daily life?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in classroom discussion and “mathematical metaphors in art” project.

Vocabulary:

dimunition, derives, peripheral, discipline, chaos theory, trajectories, intersect, compression, labyrinths, symmetry, geometry, continuum, abstract algebra, profound, intuitive

Extension Activities:

1. Students interview a person who uses math in his or her occupation. Students should find out specifically how math is used in this occupation and obtain an example of a typical math problem (worked out to find a solution). This information can then be posted in the classroom.



2. Study a famous mathematician or mathematical discovery, and present this information to the class.



3. Find another New York Times article dealing with mathematics in the “everyday” world to read and discuss with your classmates.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Science: Relate perceptions and stereotypes of scientists to those of mathematicians. How are scientists portrayed in movies and on television? How are these media stereotypes similar? How are they different?



Language Arts: Study the “mathematics of poetry” (specifically, meter and rhyme schemes).

Academic Content Standards:

Grades 6-8

Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmark: Understands that mathematicians often represent real things using abstract ideas like numbers or lines- they then work with these abstractions to learn about the things they represent.

Art Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmark: Knows how various concepts and principles are used in the arts and disciplines outside the arts (e.g., balance, shape, pattern)



Grades 9-12

Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmarks: Understands that theories in mathematics are greatly influenced by practical issues- real-world problems sometimes result in new mathematical theories and pure mathematical theories sometimes have highly practical applications; Understands that mathematics provides a precise system to describe objects, events, and relationships and to construct logical arguments; Understands that mathematics often stimulates innovations in science and technology

Art Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmarks: Knows ways in which various art media can be integrated; Understands how elements, materials, technologies, artistic processes, and organizational principles are used in similar and distinctive ways in the various art forms
