''If anyone thinks they're going to win that way, they're crazy,'' said the 32-year-old Denison University graduate in his pit before Andretti hitched a ride back to his. ''Because I'm sitting here and he's sitting somewhere out there.''

Fittipaldi inherited the lead, but only because Al Unser Jr. had already made a routine pit stop. The 38-year-old Brazilian, a two-time world driving champion who is in his second season with Indy cars, held it until he had to pit on lap 38. This gave Little Al, as he is known by his competitors, a large lead, which he held until the 68th 1.68-mile lap when he made his final refueling stop. Fittipaldi, however, had to give back the lead for good on the 80th lap when he made his final pit stop.

Al Unser Jr., winning his second race in three years on the Indy circuit, averaged 90.167 miles an hour in a car named ''Domino's Pizza Hot One Lola'' after the sponsor.

''Mario and Danny ran into a little bad luck and that's pretty much all we needed,'' said young Unser, who drives for Doug Shierson's team, which last year had Sullivan as its driver.

Last year at Laguna Seca, Calif., Mario Andretti was second and Michael third, the best previous father-son performance in Indy racing. Today's performance was not exactly thrilling to Al Sr. ''Very few fathers get to see their sons win a race,'' he said. ''I'd still want to win myself. People are always asking what will happen when it comes down to the two of us at the end of the race. I'd have liked it to happen today. I know one thing. He's not going to back off.''

Al Sr. was asked if he would give his son some tips on the Cleveland road course, where he won last year and where the circuit goes next week.

''I think it's about time he returns the favor,'' said Big Al, ''and tells me what's going on.'' ''I think it's great,'' said Little Al. ''The agreement a long time ago,'' his father told him, ''was that you're not supposed to pass your father.''
