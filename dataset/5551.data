''We were clearing out, they were boxing out Billy and Herb,'' Ellison said of the play.

He saw the shot was going to fall well short. ''I might have been the only one to see it,'' said Ellison, ''because nobody jumped but me.''

Louisville then completed its finishing run, a 17-8 surge. The Cardinals used strong rebounding - they grabbed 22 to Duke's 10 in the second half - to overcome their 24 turnovers for the game. They also had seven blocked shots; Duke had none.

''We just pulled together like we normally do in the stretch,'' said Thompson, who scored 8 of his 13 points in the second half. Crook finished with 10 points as Louisville, which shot 54 percent in the first half and 61 percent in the second.

Meanwhile, Duke which shot 41 percent in the first half and still lead by 37-34, slipped to 39 percent in the second, in great part because the Cardinal defense shut down Dawkins.

Denny Crum, the Louisville coach who watched Dawkins score 15 points in the first half and 7 straight early in the second half, put Jeff Hall, a 6-5 senior, on the all-America guard.

After Dawkins hit a jumper with 15:27 left to give Duke a 48-42 lead, he never made another field goal. He went scoreless until only 3:08 remained when he hit two free throws that gave Duke its final lead at 65-64.

''He's so dangerous when he gets the ball, so I just wanted to keep him from getting the ball,'' Hall said of Dawkins, who led Duke with 24.
