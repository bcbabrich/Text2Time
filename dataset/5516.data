The Government has established an undersea research station in the Caribbean Sea that it says will allow scientists to work for a ''virtually unlimited time'' to examine the ocean depths.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Sunday that the 81-ton station, called Aquarius, had been placed on the floor of the Salt Water Canyon off the island of St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands.

The $5.5 million station, which is 43 feet long, 12 feet wide and 16 1/2 feet high, has three compartments and can house up to six people. It replaces the undersea station Hydrolab, which completed nearly 200 missions from 1966 to 1985. Living on the Ocean Floor

The new station ''makes it possible for scientists to live and work on the ocean floor for virtually unlimited time, allowing a nine-hour day of research before returning to the habitat,'' the agency said in a statement.
