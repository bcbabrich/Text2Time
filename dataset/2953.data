Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and the N.B.A.'s marquee team survived another evening of incredibly taut playoff basketball. They will play Sunday not because they displayed the flair and panache for which they have come to be known. No, the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Sacramento Kings tonight on sheer resolve, lowering their collective shoulder until they got to the free-throw line and Game 7 of the Western Conference finals at Sacramento.

At the end, when the Lakers had won, 106-102, to even the series at three games apiece, Mike Bibby's nose was bleeding from an elbow by Bryant as Bryant worked to get around Bibby in the final seconds. Vlade Divac was bruised and sore and on the bench after getting the worse of a battle down low with O'Neal.

The Lakers scored 16 of their final 18 points from the line, the last 4 coming from Bryant in the final 20 seconds. But O'Neal (41 points, 17 rebounds) carried them for most of the night.

He made his first 10 free throws, the way a good child eats his vegetables. He took up residence a few inches from the rim, just as his coach, Phil Jackson, wanted. He blocked shots. He rebounded. He scored and scored.
