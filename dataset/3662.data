Windows 98 went on sale last week with little fanfare and supported by a puny marketing budget compared with the spending for its relentlessly promoted predecessor, Windows 95. And Windows 98 also came to market under a legal cloud, as Exhibit A in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation.

No matter, it seems, at least not in the first few days. Windows 98 flew off store shelves just as quickly as did Windows 95 when it went on sale, even slightly faster, according to PC Data, a market research firm.

In the first four days of sales, from last Thursday through Sunday, retailers sold 530,000 copies of Windows 98, PC Data reported yesterday, based on daily sales reports from 20 chains with 6,000 stores. In its first four days on the market three years ago, Windows 95 sold 510,000 copies.

Microsoft had sought to deflate expectations for Windows 98, positioning the new operating system as a ''tune-up'' to its predecessor instead of a ground-breaking new product. With the low-key introduction, most analysts had expected Windows 98 sales to build more gradually than was the case with Windows 95.
