More than 50 Special Operations troops have been active in the cave-riddled mountains of Tora Bora, near Jalalabad. Some have been working with anti-Taliban Afghan militias, who are searching through the caves for die-hard Al Qaeda members and intelligence documents. Other Americans, including commandos and snipers, have operated independently in their hunt for Al Qaeda warriors trying to escape into Pakistan.

It was unclear which Americans were attacked today.

In Kandahar, Mr. Shirzai had been planning to send thousands of soldiers to begin a military campaign against the Taliban holdouts. But the plan was placed on hold late Sunday when Taliban commanders offered to surrender, said Yusuf Pashtun, a senior aide to Mr. Shirzai.

''We have now canceled that plan,'' Mr. Pashtun said this morning, minutes before he left Kandahar for Helmand in a convoy that included the six American vehicles. The convoy stopped briefly in front of the house of Ahmed Karzai, the brother and chief spokesman for Hamid Karzai, the leader of Afghanistan's interim government.

Afghan commanders said the Taliban had been given until Thursday to fulfill their surrender agreement.

Sher Muhammad, the governor of Helmand, who was in Kandahar this morning, said a force of Afghan soldiers and the American Special Forces troops were going to the towns of Musa Qala and Kajaki, just south of Baghran. The Taliban were expected to surrender their weapons and vehicles in those towns, before being allowed to return to their villages, Mr. Muhammad said.

Mr. Muhammad said the Taliban there are being led by a commander from the area named Abdul Waheed, but better known as Rais Baghran. Mr. Muhammad added that the Taliban commander had insisted that Mullah Omar was not in Baghran, an assertion that some anti-Taliban commanders seemed willing to believe.

But Muhammad Zali, another senior commander for Mr. Shirzai, said the Taliban officials might be lying and buying time to allow Mullah Omar to escape. ''They will say anything,'' Mr. Zali said. ''We cannot trust them. We have to search all the areas in Baghran to make sure Mullah Muhammad Omar is not there.''
