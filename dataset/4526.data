The Federal Government's first comprehensive study of whether giving clean needles to addicts can help prevent the spread of AIDS has concluded that it does and that the Government should finance a significant expansion of such programs.

The Federal panel reviewed programs in the United States, Canada and Europe, in which drug abusers can turn in a used needle and get a fresh, sterile one.
