It was to have been an audacious gesture in an already daring design. As envisioned by the architect Santiago Calatrava, the enormous counterpoised wings forming the rooftop of the World Trade Center Transportation Hub were to have opened almost 50 feet wide to the sky, in fine weather and on each anniversary of the terrorist attacks.

“On a beautiful summer day,” Mr. Calatrava said, “the building can work not as a greenhouse but as an open space.”

And on each Sept. 11, he said, the rooftop could open again, “giving us the sense of unprotection.”

The idea of an entire building in movement was startling, but it would not have been the first kinetic work by Mr. Calatrava, who is a sculptor and an engineer. The winglike sunscreen at the Milwaukee Art Museum opens and closes twice daily, and has become a civic attraction in its own right.

But this morning, Mr. Calatrava’s wings were clipped at the World Trade Center site, as officials began to reckon with budgets and timetables that they now concede are well beyond earlier estimates.

The roof is not going to be operable, said Christopher O. Ward, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The authority is building the hub as a PATH terminal and as a connecting point for subway lines and below-ground pedestrian traffic.

“This is a tough choice, but it is the right choice,” Mr. Ward said in a statement. “It’s reflective of the kinds of choices we simply must make in the coming weeks and months if we are to establish priorities and milestones, to which we can be held accountable.”

In the text of a speech prepared for delivery to the Alliance for Downtown New York, Mr. Ward also said: “Making this decision helps preserve the overall iconic nature of Calatrava’s winged design, but it will allow the Hub” to “literally fit better with the other buildings on the site; when the wings opened they came far too close to the surrounding office towers.”

When the idea was introduced four years ago, it was said that the operability of the roof would help clear the main transit hall of smoke in case of a fire.

Given financing limits, the authority must find ways to build the hub for no more than $2.5 billion. Though officials have insisted that the hub’s signature features would be maintained, subtle and not-so-subtle changes have already been made, some that are arguably more significant than opening and closing roof wings. For instance, the underground mezzanine was originally to have been illuminated with skylights set in the pavement of the memorial plaza above. That arrangement, which far more directly affects the experience of daily commuters, was quietly scrapped in recent months.

As the design is further modified — some might say whittled away — another possibility is that more of the existing PATH terminal will be used than was originally planned.

While the mechanism to open and close the wings was relatively straightforward, the wings themselves would have to be specially engineered to maintain their structural integrity in different positions and while in motion. Keeping the roof stationary and sealed might save tens of millions of dollars at least. The defenders of Mr. Calatrava’s design have maintained that the architectural flourishes, a small part of the overall budget, are easy and obvious to trim but exact a high cost for the overall aesthetic integrity of the project.
