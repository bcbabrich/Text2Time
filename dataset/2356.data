A battle over a closely contested State Senate seat in Yonkers that has dragged on since Election Day continued yesterday before the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals. Lawyers for Nicholas A. Spano, the Republican who is seeking re-election to the seat, and Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat who has waged a vigorous campaign to unseat him, argued for more than an hour before the panel of seven judges, who are expected to issue a ruling in the case this week. The legal arguments centered on unresolved questions about hundreds of paper ballots in the 35th Senate District. Mr. Spano is leading by 58 votes. He has served in the State Legislature for 26 years, 18 of them in the Senate. Ms Stewart-Cousins is a Westchester County legislator. Al Baker (NYT)
