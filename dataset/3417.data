New-media concepts still baffle many of the 17,000 who attended Natpe. Many think digital television means high-definition television, and dismiss it as a gimmick. Others understand that digital TV simply means a digitally compressed signal that can carry voluminous amounts of extra information with the traditional sound and picture -- but even those people have no clue what extra information their viewers will want.

And so the computer mavens -- distinguishable by the sporty polo shirts they wore instead of jackets and ties -- swooped in, preaching the gospel of digital bits and video streaming. Steve Klein, director of new-business development for Intervu Inc., a company that helps people expand the reach and speed of their Web sites, said Internet knowledge among television executives was rising.

''Two years ago, it would have been 'Streaming -- what?' '' he said. ''Last year it was, 'Streaming -- how?' And this year, it's 'Streaming -- when?' Can you do it live? Can you do video on demand?''

Last year, three panels during the four-day convention addressed new-media issues. This year, 11 did, out of 31 altogether. Last year, a seminar on how to sell ads on a Web site drew 10 people who sat around a table together; this year, it attracted almost 100, and aides had to drag more chairs into the room.

Molly Glover, the director of interactive marketing at the Granite Broadcasting Corporation, which owns 10 television stations, helped conduct that seminar.

All 10 Granite stations have Web sites, and 3 -- in San Jose, Calif., Buffalo and Austin, Tex. -- are ''streaming'' their news broadcasts now: This means people with personal computers, no matter where they are, can watch the station's local news live, or tune in to catch the traffic report. They do so through Mr. Cuban's company, Broadcast.com, which announced during Natpe that it had just signed contracts with two ABC stations -- WABC, Channel 7 in New York, and WPVI in Philadelphia -- to stream their news.

''We've had quite a few E-mails from servicemen or other people overseas who have watched their local news,'' Ms. Glover said. ''And snowbirds in Florida like to watch the Buffalo weather.''
