The two-and-a-half-hour play is performed on Saturdays and Sundays (except Easter Sunday) at 2:30 P.M. Tickets are $20; $12.50 for children. Slices of homemade cake are available for $1 at intermission.

Parking is difficult, but there is a municipal lot behind the theater, from 35th to 38th Street. The No. 127 bus from the Port Authority in Manhattan stops at 32d Street; the exact-change fare is $1.90 each way and the trip takes about 15 minutes. (Make sure you're on the right bus; there are many marked "Union City.") On the way back to Manhattan, we rode on the bus with King Herod and St. Peter, in street clothes. Easter Egg Hunt and Rolling Contest Central Park North Meadow, Ballfield No. 9 Enter at 100th Street and Central Park West or 97th Street and Fifth Avenue (800) 201-7275 Recommended ages: 3 to 12 Tomorrow

Last year, Bruce Cannon, a puppeteer at the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater in Central Park, was the bunny who presides over this annual contest. This year, he's not. "I got chased around a lot last year," Mr. Cannon said. "Particularly by the girls." Which wasn't so terrible, he admitted, but it was exhausting.

It's that time, when about 600 children, representing a healthy cross section of New York City, compete with one another as they trample the North Meadow, which is as brown as cowhide right now. At least the plastic eggs for the hunt add color. (The 2,000 eggs will be hidden at 8 A.M. tomorrow by New York City Parks and Recreation employees.) The hunt, for 3- and 4-year-olds only, please, is at 11 A.M., but you must register by 10 A.M.

At the egg roll, 5-to-12-year-olds use spoons to roll wooden eggs along marked lines to the finish, which may sound easy, but it's not. Participants must register by 11 A.M. for the noon event.
