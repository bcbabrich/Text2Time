The study did not look at the incidence of diseases associated with obesity, like diabetes, high blood pressure and high levels of blood cholesterol. About 6 percent to 8 percent of obese people develop diabetes, said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, adding that ''diabetes heads the list'' of diseases associated with being fat.

The lead author of the study, Dr. June Stevens, an epidemiologist and nutritionist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, said that she and her colleagues analyzed data collected by the American Cancer Society for a study of cancer prevention.

The investigators excluded people who had ever smoked and people who were ill or who had had a recent unexplained weight loss. But that still left more than 300,000 people who had been followed from 1960 to 1972.

In analyzing the data, Dr. Stevens and her colleagues considered body mass index as a measure of fatness. Body mass is defined as 4.89 times the weight in pounds divided by the height in feet squared.

The ideal body mass is usually said to be 21. For a woman who is 5 foot 5, that corresponds to a weight of about 126 pounds. Every 6 pounds of weight gained would increase her body mass index by 1 point.

A man who is 5 foot 10 and had a body mass index of 21 would weigh 146 pounds. Every 7 pounds he gained would increase his body mass index by 1 point. (To calculate how many pounds equal one point in your body mass index, take your height in feet, square it, and multiply it by 0.204.) But, the data show, even among the youngest people in the study, those ages 30 to 44, among whom the effects of obesity were most profound, there were no excess deaths associated with obesity until the body mass index was above 27 and, even then, the effects were relatively modest -- less than a 25 percent to 50 percent excess death rate -- until the body mass index was about 32, when the risk of death approximately doubles for those ages 30 to 54.

Dr. Stevens said that she found the increase in death rates caused by obesity at younger ages to be alarming. And even though there is no good treatment, or even a proven prevention, that does not mean that people should be complacent, she said.

''Obesity is an extremely important public health problem,'' Dr. Stevens said. And, she added, with one third of Americans overweight, defined as body mass indexes above 27, ''Americans are getting so fat that it's incredible.''
