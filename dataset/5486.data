Merrill Lynch Mortgage Investors Inc. is offering $71.5 million of 10.20 percent mortgage pass-through certificates due 2002, at a price of 98.27, to yield 10.63 percent, or about 1.4 percentage points more than Treasury notes due 1992.

Rated AA by Standard & Poor's, the pass-through certificates are backed by a pool of mobile-home loans with an average interest rate of 14.5 percent. Additional security is provided by letters of credit from a group of banks rated double A, covering 22 percent of the unpaid principal balance of the loan pool.

The loans are expected to prepay at a rapid enough rate to result in an estimated average life of about five years for the certificates.
