[ “Terms of Endearment” and “Clue” are among several films being adapted for the theater ]

Authenticity was not necessarily Mr. Sudeikis’s stated goal at “S.N.L.,” where he contributed impressions of Joe Biden and Mitt Romney. He and Kristen Wiig played a pair of arrogant blockheads; and he and Will Forte teamed up as ESPN anchors barking out play-by-play commentary and awkward sponsorship slogans (“the Today contraceptive sponge: put a baby blocker in your lady locker!”).

On “S.N.L.,” Mr. Sudeikis said, “braggarts and show-offs” were his specialty. Compared to someone like Ms. Wiig, who he said “could picture a character and then write toward that picture,” Mr. Sudeikis said he, out of a “lack of imagination, could only write things that were always like a version of myself.”

But there was room, too, for unusual character pieces and flights of fancy, like a sketch where he and Mr. Forte played two Southern-accented eccentrics arguing whether Mr. Sudeikis had stolen a potato chip from Mr. Forte’s bowl. “That is absolutely a Tennessee Williams play,” Mr. Sudeikis said. “If we took 10 percent off that, that’s a full drama.”

Mr. Forte said that in their “S.N.L.” partnership, “He’s the alpha dog, and I’m the second-fiddle bumbling buddy — he’s doing all the hard work, and I just have a goofy smile on my face.”

Growing up in Overland Park, Kan., Mr. Sudeikis said he was the product of a wide range of influences. As a high school student averse to handing in his English homework, Mr. Sudeikis landed in night school, where a teacher turned him on to classic films like “Citizen Kane.” At community college, another instructor encouraged him to try out for the school musical after he quit the basketball team, and he landed the role of the Boy in “The Fantasticks.”

He received a different kind of education when he moved to Chicago in the 1990s to study comedy with Second City; the Annoyance Theater, whose founder, Mick Napier, became a mentor; and ImprovOlympic (now iO) . That training led to paid positions in Second City’s national tour and its Las Vegas company, and then to “S.N.L.” in 2003.
