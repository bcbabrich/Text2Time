A few weeks later, since fishing is her passion and my mother's friend is no fisherman, I searched out the bamboo poles from the depths of the woodshed. We spent an hour sanding rust from the old hooks. ''Every time we fished we had to sand every single one clean,'' she said. ''Father would never throw a one of them away.''

We stashed the bank poles in the trunk and drove to the river, where everything's feeding on whatever's in reach: dragonflies, mosquitoes, water snakes on top, bass, catfish, crappie in the sinkholes, and, stalking the mussel beds, the great blue herons. Mother cocked her head, listening. '' 'Can't catch when the locusts grind,' is what father always said.'' But we did: The next morning a single pole bobbed and dipped, a nice blue channel cat. Back home she pried the hook free, studied it a moment, then tossed it in the garbage.

Should I dwell on her strength - plunging a butcher knife into the channel cat's steel-gray head - or her need - angry and red-faced at her impotence before the medical bureaucracy? Anyone who's not dealt with health-care systems for the elderly is in for an education. I know what we wanted to hear, myself and my scattered brothers and sisters: she's doing fine, she loves our visits but doesn't need our help, she has her bridge club, bowling, golf, reading, volunteer work, the church, friends. Over long-distance lines, in letters she tells us this, and we believe her.

But a summer is a long time to keep up an illusion, and one Monday morning after I'd been gone for the weekend she dropped her guard. ''It's Sunday afternoons that get to you,'' she said. ''There's nobody to call, nothing on television, a million things you can't bring yourself to do. Sometimes I just get in the car and drive.'' Then she stood abruptly and disappeared, to reappear a half-hour later waving a wrench: ''I fixed the toilet,'' she said. I checked it out: the leak was gone.

I was in Kentucky for only three months, but things move fast in California - out of sight, out of mind. To listen to my friends, I might have been leaving for Beulah Land. Three months in Kentucky? Drop a line, my San Francisco friends said, and I could have cut their skepticism with a knife. Let us know how it goes, they said, we're thinking of doing the same for our folks.
