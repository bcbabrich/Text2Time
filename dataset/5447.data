President Chun Doo Hwan approved sweeping democratic changes today, including direct presidential elections, and said he hopes they would usher in ''a new era of democratic development and mature politics.''

''Let us work another miracle by developing Korea into a model of political development deserving to be so recorded in world history,'' Mr. Chun said in a nationally broadcast address. ''We must not be content with having newly become a model of economic development.'' [ Excerpts, page A8. ] Mr. Chun's acceptance of change, recommended unexpectedly on Monday by his designated successor, sealed one of the most dramatic and sudden reversals of policy in South Korea's 39-year history.

It was an action Mr. Chun clearly did not seek, but instead had forced upon him by a mixture of street protests, United States pressure and concern about the long-range consequences for the South Korean economy and the successful staging of the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. [ In Washington, Administration officials described a process of delicate maneuvering over the last few months to encourage the Seoul Government to accept a range of political initiatives. They said the United States had made it clear that it would not support any move by South Korean officials to resist such changes. Page A8. ]

Opposition leaders praised Mr. Chun's speech but cautioned that much remained to be done.

''This is the beginning of a new step for democracy in Korea,'' said Kim Young Sam, president of the main opposition group, the Reunification Democratic Party. But Mr. Kim warned, ''From now on, if something untoward should happen, the people would not forgive him.'' Overture to Protesters
