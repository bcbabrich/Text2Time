"I don't feel like it was a raw deal for me," Hector said. "With six weeks, I should be ready to go."

Hector said that he's leaving open the possibility that the Jets will call him back, but he said there were no guarantees offered when he reached his injury settlement with team officials this morning.

"If they feel like after six weeks I'm 100 percent healthy and I can help the team, then they'll call me back," Hector said.

Coslet said the thought of having Hector return about the middle of the season was in the back of the Jets officials' minds when they made the injury settlement. Coslet said the team's situation would dictate whether Hector would be brought back at the end of six weeks.

Hector said he hadn't thought about the possibility of being picked up by another team. That is unlikely since he has an injury that will require six weeks to heal. If he does not return to the Jets, he will be remembered for his performance against Miami in the final game of last season. Coming off the bench and subbing for an injured Thomas, Hector had 13 carries for 132 yards and helped put the Jets in the playoffs for the first time since 1985.

Heading into training camp this year, Hector was facing stiff competition for the fourth running-back spot from A. B. Brown, who was coming off a knee injury, and Chaffey, a big fullback who blocks and catches well. When Brown was cut last week, Hector realized he was vulnerable.

With Taylor and Stargell being cut, the Jets no longer have any of their draft picks from the second through the sixth round of the 1990 draft. Blake Will Be No. 3 Passer
