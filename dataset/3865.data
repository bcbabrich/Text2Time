''It's impossible to talk about any other alternatives without one side accusing you of being a traitor and having a hidden agenda,'' Professor MacCoun said.

The polarization has been illustrated by the refusal of Senator Jesse Helms to let the Foreign Relations Committee that he leads consider the nomination of William F. Weld as United States Ambassador to Mexico. Senator Helms, Republican of North Carolina, accuses Mr. Weld, the former Massachusetts Governor, of being soft on drugs because he favors making medicinal marijuana available for seriously ill people. In fact, Mr. Weld, as a Federal prosecutor, put drug traffickers behind bars.

The 34 professionals advocating a new look at drug policy plan to announce 14 ''principles for practical drug policies'' at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday. Their move constitutes the first attempt in years to bring pragmatism as well as civility to what has degenerated into a shouting match.

''It's being done to make clear to people that the argument between the legalizers and the drug warriors isn't where the action is, if what you're really trying to do is reduce the damage that drugs do to American society,'' said Mark A. R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''What we'd like to do is make it politically safe to say something sensible about drug policy.''

Though the people who have signed the statement are generally known for their work on issues like drug addiction, most have not publicly spoken out about drug policy before. To avoid partisanship, none of the prominent personalities on either side of the drug debate were invited to sign the declaration, which also avoids much of the language of the current heated debate. For example, it speaks of reducing the damage of drugs to society rather than ''harm reduction,'' a phrase that connotes cutting down on the harm addicts do to themselves.
