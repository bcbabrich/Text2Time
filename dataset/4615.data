The Missing 'Falsettos'

The Broadway season ended this week on a slightly sour note for "Falsettos," despite the many positive reviews it received. It was the last musical to open by Wednesday, the cutoff date for Tony Award eligibility, but neither Channel 5's 10 P.M. news nor Channel 4's 11 P.M. news carried reviews by their respective critics, Stewart Klein and Pia Lindstrom. "Falsettos" combines two one-act musicals about gay life in the early 1980's -- "March of the Falsettos" and "Falsettoland," by William Finn and James Lapine -- that were produced separately Off Broadway.

So why does it matter that these two news programs looked the other way? For the Broadway theater industry, locked in a constant struggle with local stations about lack of coverage, it means a lot. Broadway has been lucky these last six weeks with its anomalous surplus of Hollywood stars. But without Glenn Close or Jessica Lange to tantalize local news directors, Broadway shows have been increasingly ignored in the last year. "Falsettos" has no stars.

"It's a great disappointment to us that a major network like NBC has arbitrarily decided not to support a new American musical by refusing to review our show," say Barry and Fran Weissler, the show's producers. "It is outrageous that this is a decision that not only affects our show, but could affect our entire industry in the coming seasons."

Ms. Lindstrom says: "We have had a policy over the last year not to cover every Broadway show. What I review is my decision in collaboration with the executive producer, who will look at a list of openings and ask, 'What can you eliminate here?' If a show is a revival, doesn't have stars or has a limited appeal, then we don't do it. As a news organization, it is our right to decide what to cover."
