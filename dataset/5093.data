Successive NATO commanders have said that at present strengths, Soviet conventional superiority will force them to request authority to use nuclear weapons very early in any conflict. Gen. John Galvin, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, said that ''we must rely on our short range nuclear forces.'' His predecessor, Gen. Bernard Rogers, calculated that it would be just a matter of days after coming under attack that nuclear weapons would be needed to prevent the collapse of NATO defenses. Complex Control of Warheads

But even in the unlikely event that the alliance's civilian leaders agreed that tactical nuclear weapons should be used - in the equally unlikely event that such a war broke out - the request and authorization process to use nuclear weapons must go through seven military and political levels before a warhead would be released. Under the best of circumstances this would take about 24 hours. In the chaos of the early days of a war, it is doubtful that the process could be completed in time to keep up with events on the battlefield.

Gen. Donn Starry, in testimony on Capitol Hill before he retired from the Army, said, ''The delays that are attendant upon asking for and receiving nuclear weapons release always create a situation in which, if you wait until they get into your territory to ask for the use of nuclear weapons, it is always too late.''

The Soviet Union has forsworn first use of nuclear weapons, but its military writings make it clear that NATO's battlefield nuclear arsenal is at the top of its list of targets. There are less than 100 American-controlled nuclear storage sites in Europe and the Soviet commanders know their locations. According to American intelligence officers, the Soviet forces plan to attack them from the air and with special operations forces in the event of war. And Soviet military journals imply that if there are signs that the alliance is preparing to use the weapons, the other side would pre-empt such action with its own nuclear weapons. A Short-Lived Advantage

But even if NATO forces fire first to halt a Soviet attack, it would provide only a short-lived military advantage if Soviet forces responded by using nuclear missiles from their own formidable inventory of battlefield weapons. This in turn could lead to nuclear escalation, which neither side wants.
