Ramsey Clark, a former United States attorney general, spent several hours with the former Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, in a United Nations cellblock where Mr. Milosevic has been held since June 29. Mr. Clark, who plans a third visit today, has ''only given legal advice'' to Mr. Milosevic and has not been hired as counsel, said Jim Landale, the spokesman for the tribunal that charged Mr. Milosevic with war crimes. Mr. Clark, 73, who served under President Johnson in the late 1960's, has since taken up causes that often put him at odds with American policy. Marlise Simons (NYT)
