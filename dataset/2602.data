In the statement accompanying the interest rate increase, the central bank acknowledged that the economy showed strength, and it ended by saying that it would ''respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.''

But many view the Fed's extremely measured approach to curbing inflation, which is running at a rate of 2.9 percent so far this year, as a mistake. Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said such a tack allowed for too much inflationary pressure to build before meaningful brakes were finally applied.

Mr. Kasriel points to the past for evidence of what can happen when the Fed begins to raise rates well after inflation has taken hold. He identified two other periods during which the Fed began to increase rates when the Fed funds rate was in negative territory, adjusted for inflation, as it is now. Each time -- in March 1971 and July 1980 -- inflation soon took off with a vengeance.

''Everyone recognizes that holding the Fed funds rate below the inflation rate is a recipe for accelerating inflation because it creates an incentive for people to go out and buy things and finance them at relatively low rates,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''That act tends to drive the prices of those goods and services even faster. That was the predicament the Fed got itself into in the 1970's and spent a long time remedying. Now the Fed is in the early stages of squandering some of the gains that chairman Volcker made in eliminating inflation during the 80's.''

Mr. Kasriel said he thought the Fed would be forced to abandon its measured approach to interest rate increases early next year when inflation pressures become undeniable.

The stock market barely reacted to the rate increase; the Dow Jones industrial average closed the day up 22.05 points. Bonds rallied, pushing yields on the 10-year Treasury down to 4.58 from 4.69 on Tuesday.

Richard Bernstein, chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he was surprised that investors seemed so optimistic about the Fed's move because corporate profits were no longer rising. A study of history, Mr. Bernstein added, indicates that financial disruptions have followed periods when the Fed raised rates while corporate profits slowed.
