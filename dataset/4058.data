A behind-the-scenes skirmish erupted into a full-scale partisan battle in the Senate today over the ability of Federal Express workers to organize.

On the surface, the argument was over the arcane issue of whether to restore the words ''express company'' to the Railway Labor Act, an action that could greatly restrict the ability of Federal Express workers to affiliate with a union.

But it turned into a heated debate in Congress between supporters and opponents of organized labor and stalled passage of a bill providing financing for the Federal Aviation Administration.

Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, took to the floor today to denounce the lobbying efforts of Federal Express to change the wording of the law.
