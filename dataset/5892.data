In July of 1933, we left Germany on a temporary visa and went to Czechoslovakia, where we stayed for the summer. We then proceeded from country to country, seeking admittance to the United States. It was very difficult in those days to come to the United States. It still is. That is one of the reasons why I take such an interest in the immigration bill.

In 1933, we lived at first in Czechoslovakia. Then we went to Switzerland and stayed there for about a half year, and then on to Holland and stayed there also about six months. At each stop, my father would talk to the American consul in order to see if we could gain admittance to the United States, and at each stop he was told no, because of the quota systems that existed at that time.

Finally, when we were in England, my father was able to convince the American consul that we should come under the German quota. So finally we were able to come here.

My father told me that each stop, he would always ask himself whether we were far enough removed from the threats that he saw even in 1933 and 1934. In 1935, even with the channel between us and Germany, he felt we were not far enough removed.

So yesterday was a momentous day. I called my brother and my sister and we talked about it. We talked about our luck, about the greatness of the opportunity to come to the United States and what a remarkable country it was, proven by the fact that someone of my background should rise to become a U.S. Senator from a state like Minnesota, which is inhabited mostly by Scandinavians and Germans and certainly not by people of my background and origin.
