It is not a surprise that the state Democrats decided to hold their annual conference here in Garden City in Nassau County.

In terms of political geography, it’s the heart of the state’s Republican Party and its last redoubt, the majority held by Republicans in the State Senate. In fact, the hotel where the Democrats are meeting is only four miles from the offices of Joseph N. Mondello, the state Republican Party chairman and head of the Nassau County party.

Occasionally, a factoid has been presented by some — though it is hard to confirm — that at the high point of Republican dominance here, Nassau had the highest per capita Republican registration of any county in the entire country. It was the archetype of the conservative, Republican-voting suburb during the postwar years.

But Long Island Democrats have slowly come back in recent years, a comeback driven by changing demographics, Republican scandals and the lessening salience of crime as a political issue. In 2001, Thomas R. Suozzi became the first Democrat elected Nassau County executive here in nearly 70 years. Steve Levy followed in Mr. Suozzi’s shoes a couple of years later. Democrats control the Nassau County Legislature and have a shot at grabbing a majority in the Suffolk one, too.

That’s a story that Democrats would like to see repeated for state-level offices — like the seven powerful Republican state senators from Long Island. There used to be eight, until Craig M. Johnson took an empty seat, with help from Gov. Eliot Spitzer, in a special election this year.

State Democrats are hoping to knock off a few more of their Republican colleagues next year. Three more seats would give the Democrats a majority in the State Senate. There is already a Democratic-elected governor in Mr. Spitzer and a majority in the State Assembly.

“We selected Nassau County because Nassau County is very important, not only in the local races this year, but to signal the importance of Long Island for the future of the party,” said June O’Neill, the chairwoman of the state party.
