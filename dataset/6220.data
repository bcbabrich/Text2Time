Blood shortages so severe as to force postponement of elective surgery exist in several major cities across the United States. Acute shortages were first noted in New York City, where this weekend officials of the Greater New York Blood Bank Program asked surgeons to cancel all but emergency operations. Although donors have responded in sufficient numbers to increase the blood reserve to a day and a half's supply, still shortages were so low yesterday that officials said they could not effectively deal with a disaster such as an airplane or bus crash.

Donors were urged to go to either the Red Cross building at 150 Amsterdam Ave. at 66th Street on the West Side or to the blood center at 310 East 67th Street. More than 900 pints were collected at the centers yesterday.

Even in cities where blood supplies are low but still adequate to permit elective surgery, hospitals are being forced to rely on blood from paid donors, thus increasing the risks of patientsâ€™ developing infectious or serum hepatitis, which are serious liver infections. Use of commercial blood carries with it a much greater risk of a patient's developing hepatitis from several weeks to months after receiving a transfusion of even one pint of blood.

Among the areas where blood is in short supply are: metropolitan NeW York, Boston and elsewhere in Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Fredericksburg, Va., New Orleans and Shreveport, La., Chicago and Los Angeles. Some cities were able to meet their community needs only by importing blood that had been donated elsewhere. Injuries resulting from recent plane crashes in Chicago further depleted the city's supplies.
