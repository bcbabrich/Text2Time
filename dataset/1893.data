So who won the Subway Series this year?

As the Mets spokesman, Jay Horwitz, said in a statement, “We won four of six games from the Yankees.”

And over the weekend, the Mets and the Yankees won two games apiece — “a split” in the words of our Mets reporter, Ben Shpigel.

So how is it that the Empire State Building officials declared the Yankees victorious, illuminating the landmark icon in the Yankees’ blue and white team colors on Monday night? A news release on Monday declared, “Empire State Building Shines For Yankees’ Win!”

This sparked confusion. An e-mail message was sent to City Room, written by a curious reader: “I just looked out my office window and noticed the Empire State Building shining a bright blue and white. How can this be when the Yankees lost the Subway Series, 4 games to 2?”



Other Met fans expressed indignation.

It’s enough to validate the recent sentiment espoused by Jerry Manuel, the Mets’ manager, who said that his squad is “kind of the second team.”

But the light slight, apparently, comes down to how one defines “series.”

As has been noted on this blog before, the Empire State Building, outfitted with high-tech lights, has done a Solomonic splitting-the-baby approach during this year’s two Subway Series weekends, splitting the four sides of the building into both teams’ colors: blue and white (Yankees) on the north and south sides, and blue and orange (Mets) for the east and west. The victor of each three-game series knocks out the other team’s colors for that weekend.

So what happened? Well, the Mets won two of the three games at Yankee Stadium in May, but the third — the May 16 game — was rained out and rescheduled for this past Friday, just before the first of the already scheduled three-game series at Shea Stadium — it resulted in a day-night doubleheader in two stadiums.

The Yankees then proceeded to win the scheduled three-game series at Shea Stadium, 2 games to 1.

“Each year, the Empire State Building celebrates the friendly New York rivalry of the Mets-Yankees subway series by splitting its tower lights for both teams’ colors, with the winning team of each weekend’s games claiming the entire crown of the world’s most famous office building,” said James Connors, the general manager at the Empire State Building.

Mr. Connors went on to say:

We’re bipartisan here at the Empire State Building and love both of our home teams equally. Because the Yankees won two of the three scheduled games for this past weekend’s Subway Series at Shea, the building was lighted in Yankees blue-and-white on Monday night. As you may remember, the Mets won the Subway Series weekend last May, so the building was lighted in Mets blue and orange as a result. Thus, both teams are 1-1 for the overall 2008 Subway Series season, just like the results from last year. We’re glad to see New York City’s baseball fans getting into the fun spirit of the Subway Series games with hopes of team-color bragging rights lit up on the Empire State Building.

Next, a call was made to the Elias Sports Bureau, the official baseball statistics keeper, and this is where things get murky.

“The thing is that there is no real definition of series,” said Ken Hirdt, a researcher who answered the phone. “A ‘doubleheader’ is a defined term in the rulebook and ‘series’ is not one of those terms.”

“Usually we define a series as change of venue or opponent,” he said. Note: change of venue, not change of city. And what happened on Friday was that the two teams changed sites between their two games. The Mets won in the afternoon, 15-6, at Yankee Stadium, before the Yankees won at night, 9-0, at Shea. (So much for home-team advantage.)

“There were two games in one day in the same city with the same teams — I can see why it could be considered one series,” Mr. Hirdt said. “This weekend shows where there is some gray area in the definition of a series.”

There have been Subway Series since 1997, when Major League Baseball introduced interleague play. After starting with just three games apiece in 1997 and 1998, the league moved to six games (two series of three games, one at each stadium) in 1999 because of the popularity of Yankees vs. Mets. For the last three years (2005 through 2007), 2002 and 1999, the teams split the six games. In 2004, the Mets won, 4 games to 2. In 2001 and 2002, the Yankees won, 4 games to 2.

In 2003, the Yankees won all six games. “That was a bad year for the Mets,” Mr. Hirdt noted.

(Of course, in the Subway Series that mattered most — the 2000 World Series that pitted the teams against each other — the Yankees beat the Mets, 4 games to 1.)

If it is any consolation to the Met fans (as Mr. Connors pointed out), since their team had won the two of three scheduled games in May of this year (with one unplayed), the Mets got the Empire State Building lights all to themselves.
