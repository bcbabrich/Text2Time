The Defense Ministry announced today that Palestinian students could return to Hebron University, more than three years after the school was shut to prevent political activity on its campus.

In a statement, the ministry said the university was reopened as part of a "gradual normalization of the education system" in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The three other major Palestininan universities in the territories remain closed under a military order first issued in early 1988.

"The success of the reopening process depends on the fact that this university will remain solely an academic institution, and not a center generating violence and disorder," the statement said.

The army has long accused Palestinian college students of planning and organizing the 40-month Arab uprising. But students and educators insist that Palestinian universities had no real influence on the uprising and point to the fact that the revolt has continued long after the schools were closed. They say the closings amount to collective punishment of the entire Arab community.
