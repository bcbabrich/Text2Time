When I was growing up, my aunt and uncle would occasionally leave Manhattan to visit us in our leafy suburb, but to our bewilderment, they would seldom spend the night. ''All this peace and quiet makes me nervous,'' my uncle would mutter before hurrying back to the perpetual hum of the city.

Getting away from it all -- sounds nice, doesn't it? But once you scratch the surface of that alluring phrase, what's underneath? It all depends on what you're getting away from.

For those stressed-out overachievers whose status is measured by the number of hours they spend at work, it might mean repairing to a remote island for two weeks to do nothing but lie on the beach and read books. On second thought, overachievers can seldom relax; they'd rather turn holidays into a competitive sport. In which case, they'd probably be happier hiking around an island where a series of eco-tourism resorts offers a bracing, days-long trek between lodges that incorporate self-sustaining energy technology into elegant (but appropriately spartan) modern architecture. Or, as they say in the movies, no (or almost no) unspoiled lands were harmed in the making of this vacation.

For those of us who are less geographically ambitious, maybe a two-hour drive to a little cottage at the beach is all we need. One man's getaway, lovingly perfected over the course of a decade, is far from palatial but makes up in sheer charm and comfort what it lacks in square footage. A legendary Modernist architect took the less-is-more concept even further, building himself a minuscule but perfectly organized log cabin overlooking the sea. What if you don't even want to leave your backyard in order to escape? There's a man who can design and build a folly or you -- a rustic dining pavilion, or a tiny, screened sleeping hut that offers all the romance of camping out, minus the pesky mosquitoes, and you don't even have to gas up the car.
