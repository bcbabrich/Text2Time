A Federal judge yesterday struck down major sections of the 1996 act that deregulated the telecommunications industry, saying that the law unfairly kept the regional Bell telephone companies out of the long-distance business.

If the judge's ruling withstands appeals, it would allow the Bell companies nationwide to offer long-distance service for the first time since the AT&T Corporation was broken up under court supervision in 1984. Long-distance giants, which could face a range of new competitors, are almost certain to challenge the decision.

''This is so big I can't believe it,'' said Scott Cleland, a telecommunications analyst in Washington for the Legg Mason Precursor Group. ''This was the cornerstone of the telecom act. This turns the telecom act upside down.''

Yesterday's ruling was the latest and largest salvo in a battle mostly between state regulators and the Bell companies on one side and Federal regulators and the long-distance carriers on the other. The long-distance companies and the Federal Communications Commission have been pushing the Bells to demonstrate that their networks are wide open to competitors before the Bells can offer long-distance service. The Bells and many state regulators have said the commission is making excessive demands on the Bells.
