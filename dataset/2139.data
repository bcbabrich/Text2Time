As Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans are busy working on their articles for Sunday’s newspaper, here is the situation:

West Virginia, No. 2 in the latest B.C.S. poll, lost to unranked Pittsburgh, 13-9, virtually ensuring that No. 3 Ohio State (11-1) will earn a spot in the B.C.S. championship game.

About an hour later, Missouri, which is ranked No. 1 in the B.C.S., lost to Oklahoma, 38-17, in the Big 12 title game. The Tigers’ loss opened up a spot in the B.C.S. title game for a team like Georgia, Louisiana State, Virginia Tech, Hawaii, Kansas or Southern California.

Georgia (10-2), No. 4 in the B.C.S., did not even play in the SEC title game yesterday. L.S.U. (11-2), which held the No. 1 spot for much of the season, won that game, but is currently No. 7 in the B.C.S. standings. Georgia and L.S.U. were separated by a mere .053 in the latest B.C.S. poll, with idle Kansas (11-1) and the new A.C.C. champion Virginia Tech (11-2) between them.

Here is last week’s B.C.S. poll. Crunch numbers to your delight until tomorrow night’s announcement.
