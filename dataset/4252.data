Holtz makes his case for recalling the 1989 season, when Miami won the championship over Notre Dame, which finished second. Although the two teams had the same record and both won their bowl games, the strongest argument in favor of Miami was that the Hurricanes had defeated the Irish in a head-to-head meeting.

Nothing else but that game was really relevant, Holtz recalled, including what he thought was Notre Dame's tougher schedule and the fact that the Irish beat Colorado, the top-rated team, in the Orange Bowl. Ergo, should this year's calculation resemble that of four years ago, Notre Dame should get the decision, Holtz said.

"If nobody's undefeated, then you say, O.K., the No. 1 tie breaker in everything I know is match play," Holtz said. "The N.F.L. does it this way. The college conferences do it this way. And they did it in '89. So, I don't know. All I'm worried about is finding a way to beat A&M." On Natural Turf

He spoke early today at the Cotton Bowl, where his players went through a light workout on the newly installed natural turf.

The natural turf was installed this year in preparation for next summer's World Cup soccer tournament. The playing surface should favor Notre Dame, which plays on a similar surface at home. Texas A&M plays on artificial turf. Pieces of the old plastic sod were mounted on plaques and given to Holtz and to R. C. Slocum, the A&M coach, earlier this week as mementos.

Although the game has a possible impact on the national title, its tickets aren't the hot items they once were here in what some call the capital state of football. Seats are available. Rick Baker, executive director of the game, said today, "we'll have a crowd of 71,000." Capacity is 71,456.

Part of the problem could be that the game is not only a rematch of last year's one-sided Notre Dame victory, it is the third consecutive appearance by an Aggie team that has lost the previous two. Another new wrinkle is the time of the kickoff. It will be 4:40 p.m., Eastern time, and it will be televised by NBC, opposite the Rose Bowl on ABC. The weather forecast calls for partly cloudy skies, strong breezes and temperatures in the low 60's.
