In recent years, a dramatic change in attitude toward bankruptcy has occurred within the legal profession and the corporate world. Bankruptcy was once considered a second-rate specialty, like criminal and labor law. Almost exclusively devoted to holding demanding creditors at bay, the practice was disdained by the white-shoe firms; company managers viewed bankruptcy as a humiliating last resort. But, as a result of innovative lawyering, bankruptcy courts have become forums for airing product-liability problems and labor disputes. Chapter 11 has become a refuge for solvent companies such as A. H. Robins, maker of the Dalkon Shield, and the Manville Corporation, the asbestos manufacturer, whose products have injured customers and produced an onslaught of potentially ruinous law suits. Other companies, such as Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lines, have availed themselves of the bankruptcy laws to break unions. Bankruptcy has thus become a sword as much as a shield. And no lawyer has wielded the sword more aggressively than Harvey Miller.

''Bankruptcy,'' Miller said in a recent speech in Houston, ''is like dancing with an 800 pound gorilla. You dance as long as the gorilla wants to dance.'' Typically, the bankruptcy process involves anunpredictable conflict between the company's management and committees recognized by the court to represent creditors and shareholders. Participants on both sides have their own batteries of lawyers, investment bankers and accountants.

''Bankruptcy practice now means one-third litigation, one-third negotiation and one-third mergers and acquisitions,'' says Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a senior managing director and bankruptcy specialist at the investment banking firm of Rothschild Inc. The committees can play pivotal roles in reshaping the business. They can challenge pre-bankruptcy transactions as improper conveyances that have been executed to defraud them. Their views are solicited on sales of assets, plans for liquidation and the valuations of the new company or its individual parts. And they can seek to have management thrown out in favor of a court-appointed trustee.

In the war over control of a company in Chapter 11, the first round of battle can take place outside the bankruptcy courthouse. Fearing that Pennzoil might ask Texas state courts to start seizing Texaco's assets to satisfy a $10.5 billion judgment, Miller had two associates - armed with bankruptcy papers and a walkie talkie shadow two Federal bankruptcy judges in New York over a period of months. Ultimately, Miller went with a battery of Texaco lawyers to Judge Howard Schwartzberg's house in Larchmont, N.Y., on a Sunday morning in April 1987 and personally delivered the bankruptcy petition. By beating Pennzoil to the courts, Miller took the first step in keeping his client in control of the bankruptcy process.

The toughest battle is usually over who gets to file a plan of reorganization. because this will determine who among the creditors and shareholders gets paid, and how much, and what form the company will assume after emerging from bankruptcy. At the outset of the bankruptcy proceeding, management has what is known as a period of exclusivity lasting 120 days, during which it alone may propose the reorganization plan. A bankruptcy judge has wide discretion in deciding whether to extend exclusivity.

A SLIGHT, NASAL TONE in his speech gives a clue to Harvey Miller's Brooklyn roots. Born in 1933, the second of two sons of a wood-flooring salesman, he grew up in the working-class Gravesend section. The first in his family to go beyond high school, Miller graduated from Brooklyn College in 1954 after majoring in political science. Following a two- year army stint during which he was posted to Germany, he entered Columbia Law School and, after graduation in 1959, took a job with F. E .M. Ballon, a small law firm with a general practice. After a few months, he inherited the Chapter 11 proceeding of Wise Shops, a large retail company.

''I loved it,'' he recalls. But in his next bankruptcy case, he arrived at a hearing only to discover that his opponent was Charles Seligson, a professor at New York University School of Law, who was widely regarded as a leading scholar in the field. ''I was trembling in my boots,'' Miller says. ''The judge stepped down from the bench, shook Seligson's hand and said, 'Professor, what an honor to see you.' ''
