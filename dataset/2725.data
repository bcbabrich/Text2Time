Mr. O'Keefe said that those remarks should be taken in context and that they did not address some extraordinary efforts NASA could have mounted in an emergency, as in the Apollo 13 accident in 1970.

When an oxygen tank exploded while Apollo 13 en route to the moon, the three astronauts aboard had no certain way to return home and hardly enough breathable air. But engineers cobbled together a plan to use the lunar landing vehicle as a lifeboat, cleanse the air and bring the astronauts home safely.

''Apollo 13 was not in anyone's scenario or contingency plans,'' Mr. O'Keefe said. Had anyone known that the Columbia was in trouble, he said, the agency would have used all its resources to find a solution. ''We would have poured everything we had into it,'' he said.

At a news conference shortly after the Columbia disaster, Mr. Dittemore said there would have been no way to minimize the severe heat of re-entry to protect the shuttle in the event of severely damaged tiles and thus little hope of bringing the craft down safely. Other officials also said that the shuttle did not have enough fuel to make it to the International Space Station for refuge and that there was no time for a safe launch of another shuttle to rescue the crew.

Mr. O'Keefe acknowledged that he knew of no formal contingency plan that would have covered the case of the Columbia, in which a space shuttle in orbit was suspected of having an unknown degree of damage to its thermal protection tiles. But he and William F. Readdy, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, said that much of the agency's training dealt with handling unexpected events and emergencies.
