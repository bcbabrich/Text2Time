The summit meeting in Moscow made notable advances with the signing of a strategic arms accord and a dramatic commitment to convene a Mideast peace conference in October. But Presidents Bush and Gorbachev both shied away from the hard, imperative task of seeking deeper reductions in the nuclear arms that still imperil the world.

Both said it would be impractical to eliminate their arsenals at a time when other nations still possess nuclear arms. Mr. Bush expressed particular concern about nuclear weapons in the hands of "renegades." But he seemed to rule out the risk of renegade nationalists or military officers in the Soviet Union gaining access to some of its huge stockpile of weapons. The best way to reduce that risk, however remote, is to negotiate further cuts.

The Start treaty signed yesterday cuts the long-range nuclear arsenals of the two sides for the first time since the superpower arms race began. Just as important, it provides a framework of definitions, accounting practices and verification procedures that would facilitate further reductions without the need to retrace the long and tortured path that finally produced this treaty.

Further reductions are needed because even with a 35 percent cut in Start, a chaotic Soviet Union still has 7,000 long-range nuclear weapons, and thousands more in its shorter-range arsenal. But the Soviets will only reduce these stockpiles if the U.S. agrees to corresponding cuts.
