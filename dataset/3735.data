A man who the police said threw chairs at officers as they moved to end a youth rally in Harlem was arraigned yesterday on charges of assault and reckless endangerment.

The suspect, Patrice Peterson, 22, was one of five men, then unidentified, indicted by a grand jury last month in connection with their roles at what sponsors called the Million Youth March in September. The others remain at large, the police said.

Mr. Peterson did not enter a plea at his arraignment yesterday before Judge Herbert J. Adlerberg. Mr. Peterson was arrested in Brooklyn last week on an unrelated charge that was later dropped.

Judge Adlerberg set bail for Mr. Peterson at $20,000. Roger Wareham, Mr. Peterson's lawyer, said Mr. Peterson was being arrested for political reasons and said he would ask for lower bail.
