PITTSBURGH, Dec. 1—Jerry McAfee, chairman of the Gulf Oil Corporation, lashed out today at another giant Pittsburgh company, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, contending that Westinehouse tried to hide its “greed or mana- gerial mistakes” in the nuclear power business by raising a “uranium cartel smokescreen.”

But a Westinghouse spokesman said, “If anybody is hiding behind a smokescreen, it is Gulf Oil, which has consistently refused to make available cartel documents.” A suit previously filed by Westinghouse named Gulf as one of a group of uranium producers that had allegedly conspired to fix prices.

At a meeting here before securities analysts, Harold S. Hammer, Gulf executive vice president, said Gulf made about $3 billion in capital investments this year, a record total nd almost $1. billion more than anticipated. He described the amount as “an aberration,” caused partly by the acquisition of the Kewanee Oil Corporation for 5455 million and an investment of $314 million in offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico, where natural gas discoveries have been made. Mr. Hammer said Gulf's spending would be normal $2 billion in 1978.

Mr. McAfee said commodity speculation caught Westinghouse short 60 million pounds of uranium that it had promised to utility customers. Westinghouse has been sued by more than 20 utilities over its uranium supply contracts.
