In June, the Comptroller completed an audit of the way the board keeps track of televisions and other audio-visual equipment purchased for schools. Equipment Missing

Last year, auditors visited 10 of the city's 150 high schools, selected at random, to inspect inventory records, according to Roger D. Liwer, Deputy Comptroller for audits. In the 10 schools, they discovered that much equipment was missing, including 25 televisions, 45 videotape machines, 75 tape players and five video cameras, worth a total of $77,000, Mr. Liwer said.

The most serious problems were at Julia Richman High School on East 67th Street in Manhattan, where 55 appliances worth $15,000 were missing, the report said. In a written response to the auditors, Theodore Bronsnick, an acting assistant principal at Julia Richman, acknowledged that the missing items had probably been stolen. At Herbert Lehman High School on East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, however, where 42 appliances worth $8,400 were missing, Robert Leder, the principal, told auditors that school officials had simply discarded old and unusable equipment without deleting it from board inventories.

The auditors' attempts to trace the missing items were complicated because in most cases there were no records to confirm that the equipment had ever been delivered to the schools, Mr. Liwer said.

The Bureau of Supplies buys pencils, notebooks and other high-volume products in vast quantities, storing them in its central warehouse at 44-36 Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City, Queens, for distribution to schools. But to supply schools with costlier items like computers and televisions, the bureau has commercial suppliers deliver equipment directly to schools. Criticism Ignored

In five separate inspections of the bureau from 1992 through 1993 by the Comptroller's office and by Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, auditors criticized the bureau for paying for televisions and other equipment as soon as suppliers billed the board, without confirming deliveries, Mr. Hevesi's report said. Each time the supply bureau ignored the criticisms, the report said.

In June, the bureau also rejected Mr. Hevesi's recommendation that it establish procedures to confirm deliveries before payment.
