The Aluminum Company of America says a ceramic packaging business for microchips may not meet expectations.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Paul H. O'Neill, the chairman, made the comment to securities analysts last week at an Alcoa plant in Iowa. Alcoa has spent at least $100 million on the packaging and had set this year as a deadline.

The company has said the packaging could generate $3 billion in revenue in 5 to 10 years. It was one of the few non-aluminum products Alcoa has pursued under Mr. O'Neill.
