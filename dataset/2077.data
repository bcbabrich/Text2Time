Knicks and knacks from the lovely press box at Citizens Bank Park…

As expected, the Mets placed Jorge Sosa on the disabled list this morning to create room on the roster for today’s starter, Mike Pelfrey. An MRI confirmed the strain in Sosa’s left hamstring, but Willie Randolph did not want to speculate as to how long Sosa could be out.

Nor did Randolph sound all that certain about Oliver Perez’s status. Perez seemed confident that the stiffness in his lower back would subside so he could start Tuesday in Colorado, but Randolph brought up the possibility of putting Perez on the disabled list, retroactive to Wednesday, and letting him rest through the All-Star break. If that happened, they would have to recall a pitcher from the minors. Jason Vargas would be the most likely option, but is scheduled to pitch today for Class AAA New Orleans. The Mets could always pull him.

If Perez remains in the rotation, here’s what it looks like heading into the All-Star break:

In Denver

Monday: Tom Glavine

Tuesday: Oliver Perez

Wednesday: Orlando Hernandez

In Houston

Thursday: John Maine

Friday: Pelfrey

Saturday: Glavine

Sunday: Perez

The Philadelphia Inquirer ran several stories, including one above the fold on A1 and two consecutive pages inside the sports section, on the Phillies’ “Phabulous Phutility.” They are four losses away from 10,000, and Julio Franco, who, contrary to popular opinion has not been alive for all of them, was very impressed with the presentation. “Look at all this history,” he said.

Franco began his career in the Phillies’ organization in 1978, when he ate Kentucky Fried Chicken three meals a day for their rookie-league team in Butte, Mont., and played 16 games for them in 1982 before being traded with four others to Cleveland for Von Hayes. “The best thing that ever happened to me,” Franco said.
