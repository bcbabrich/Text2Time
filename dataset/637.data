Finding a place to stay in the Hamptons during the summer can be a greater headache than the traffic, hence the anticipated reopening of the Chequit on Shelter Island. Built in 1872 as a dining hall for a local Methodist group, it has been transformed into a quaint boutique hotel with bright, airy rooms overlooking the harbor. There’s also a new restaurant, Red Maple — named after the towering tree in the center of the outdoor terrace — that serves up small plates such as smoked bluefish rillettes and oysters from nearby Montauk.
