To the Sports Editor:

"Football the Way It Oughta Be Played" (The Times, Oct. 2) made this Columbia man stand up and cheer. I played in 1939-41, and graduated in 1942. October 31 was our 50th reunion homecoming game against Princeton. My team's last game, against Princeton, was played at Princeton in 1941. We won, 21-0, and our three touchdowns were scored by three men worth remembering: Paul Governali, an all-American and the Maxwell Award winner; Phil Bayer, who scored the winning touchdown against Georgia in 1940 and a Marine killed in action on Palau in 1944, and Stewart McIlvennen, a 170-pound fullback, basketball captain, recently retired lawyer and the only survivor of the three.

George Vecsey has found something fresh and positive in college football. We should also thank him for for helping us to remember the right stuff. JACK ARBOLINO Harrington Park, N.J.
