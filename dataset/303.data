The Weather Service warned that Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia were most likely to endure severe storms on Wednesday, though forecasters also said there was an “enhanced” risk for severe weather in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

“Damaging winds are the primary severe threat,” the Weather Service said, “though a few tornadoes and hail will be possible, especially west of the Appalachians.”
