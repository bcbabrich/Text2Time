To the Editor:

The debate is not over (''What's Round, Fried and Inspirational?'', April 25)! You may have overlooked the one spot with truly the best doughnuts in New York. Has your reviewer never tasted the handmade doughnuts at the Cupcake Cafe at 39th Street and Ninth Avenue? The jelly doughnuts puffed up with raspberry jam, or honey-dipped pumpkin, whole wheat oat or simple plain doughnuts dusted with sugar are surely the best doughnuts in town.
