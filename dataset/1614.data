ESPN finally named Dan Shulman, Bobby Valentine and Orel Hershiser as its new “Sunday Night Baseball” announcing team Wednesday, three weeks after declining to renew the contracts of Jon Miller and Joe Morgan. Hershiser joined Miller and Morgan last season.

Valentine, the former Mets manager, said he was “offered” some managerial jobs in the off-season but did not specify which ones. He interviewed for jobs with the Brewers, Mariners and Blue Jays, and took himself out of the running for the Marlins’ managerial position.

He said that Terry Collins, the new Mets manager, would be “challenged” by his situation at Citi Field.

“I think he’ll also challenge the players,” he said during a conference call. “I think it’ll be a work in progress.”

Valentine, who last season was featured on ESPN’s “Baseball Tonight” program, said that he would resist the allure of managing as long as he does well in the Sunday night booth.

“It depends if Norby and the crew like what I do and if I continue to get better at what I do and continue to enjoy it,” he said, referring to Norby Williamson, the executive vice president for production at ESPN, who assembled the three-man team. Williamson extolled Miller’s and Morgan’s contributions for 21 seasons and simultaneously defended his decision to replace them.

“With Dan, Orel and Bobby,” he said, “you not only get an accomplished play-by-play announcer, but an accomplished pitcher and an accomplished manager — people who have performed at the highest level of their craft, who are conversational and know the sports inside out.”

Shulman, who has been calling ESPN’s Monday night baseball games, recalled during the call how he became a fan when he went to the Toronto Blue Jays’ first home opener in 1977.

“I was 10 years old the day the Blue Jays started,” he said, “and sat in the snow with 45,000 other fans.”
