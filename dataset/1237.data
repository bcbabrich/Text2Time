When a movie sits on the shelf for four years and appears to be receiving a theatrical run only because some of its stars now have much bigger names, you expect it to be abysmal. “The Understudy” isn’t abysmal, though it certainly is off target.

Marin Ireland (“Homeland,” “Boss”), who was just emerging as one of New York’s top stage actresses in 2008 when the movie was made, plays Rebecca, understudy to the lead in an Off Broadway production of “Electra.” Rebecca tends to commit an accidental sort of homicide that keeps putting her onstage in the star’s place. The film pits her lust for the spotlight against her guilty conscience.

Aasif Mandvi of “The Daily Show,” now receiving good reviews in “Disgraced” at the Claire Tow Theater, is respectable as Rebecca’s roommate, and the cast also includes recognizable actors like Richard Kind and Tom Wopat. The film’s downfall is its clumsy mix of serious drama and attempts at humor through tired theater clichés. Its writers and directors, David Conolly and Hannah Davis, would have done better to jettison a few plotlines and make a movie with a consistent tone.
