The Essex County Prosecutor's office today began investigating a melee that erupted as police officers tried to break up a teen-agers' holiday party at a home here early Sunday.

The disturbance led to 10 arrests, including that of Amiri Baraka, the poet and playwright, and a heavy police response that startled residents of the normally quiet neighborhood at the northern end of Montclair Avenue.

Officials said all phases of the incident would be reviewed.

"We're trying to determine exactly what happened," said Raymond Weiss, a spokesman for Prosecutor Herbert H. Tate. "We're reviewing reports and questioning as many witnesses as we can find." Complaints of Noise

Two police officers and one partygoer, identified as Mr. Baraka's 18-year-old son, Amiri Jr., suffered minor injuries as the officers, responding to complaints about excessive noise, went to the home and tried to disperse the youths, officials said. The police estimated that more than 100 people were at the party.
