With a budget squeezed by declining revenues and greater demands, and with a new City Charter, even mayoral power is subject to increasing limits. But that power can still be substantial, if only because no other city official has as much. Can anyone doubt that if Mayor Dinkins is concerned about early childhood education, he will find a way to translate that concern into policy?

But power is also at the root of the fears. Will the new Mayor be fair and evenhanded? Or will he be insensitive toward groups that didn't support him and made no secret of their dislike for blacks? Or will he be so concerned with meeting unrealistically high expectations of the poor and their advocates that he'll bankrupt the city?

Mr. Dinkins would seem to have answered the first two concerns already. His entire political background, his campaign theme of healing and his first appointments all bespeak fairness. If anything, he has demonstrated that he'll risk angering his black base to be evenhanded. The second concern ignores both his acknowledgment of the city's fiscal limitations, the role of the City Council, which must approve his spending plans, and other institutional constraints.

But power is only part of the significance of David Dinkins's mayoralty, and in the long run maybe not the most important part. Only after the late Schools Chancellor Richard Green died did most non-black New Yorkers appreciate how important he had been as a symbol to the African-American youth of New York. Mayor Dinkins is an even more potent symbol.

Months ago, before he formally announced his candidacy, Mr. Dinkins sat with a group of reporters and editors from The Times and reflected on how pleasant and secure and comfortable he was as Manhattan Borough President. Nevertheless, it was already clear that, at age 61, he had decided to sacrifice comfort and security for the challenge of winning the second-hardest job in America. He chose not to be paralyzed by fear of losing, but propelled by hope of winning.
