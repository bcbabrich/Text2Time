Louise Fishman Robert Miller Gallery 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan Through Oct. 16

One becomes accustomed to Louise Fishman's latest abstractions in the way one acclimates to seeing objects in the dark. Her large canvas called "Mars" is at first a forbidding wall of black and gray wrapped in a grid whose painted lines are like straps of black leather. Then the darkness yields up patches of red and flecks of white like light dimly glinting on the edges of the straps. This yielding up is a beautiful, slow process, and it means that "Mars" intensifies in the variety and impact of its effects.

Sometimes, as in "Sanctum Sanctorum," "Valles Marineris" and "Shadows and Traces," the rectangles within the thick framework of the uneven grid become windows of mottled colors, windows not so much onto some fictional deep space but onto a painstaking and elaborate painterly process. Ms. Fishman's art is about surface, gesture and light. But it is also about this intense and step-by-step process of pictorial construction.

With the heavy, thrusting, black and white streaks in "Iron Sharpens Iron," a different, more athletic kind of artistic labor is suggested, but one that remains measured, contained in its approach.

With some of the smaller works in the show, where the grid becomes indiscernible, the colors clash and the composition devolves into a frenzy of clotted paint, Ms. Fishman loses her grip. The grip must be tight for the works to succeed. And it is in the bigger paintings, where the emotions feel hard-won and the complex making of the images seduces the eye slowly, that Ms. Fishman confirms her position as an artist of seriousness and substance.
