A bias against modern dance and lack of understanding of Isadora Duncan's role in its foundation is reflected by the English critic Edward Thorpe in an article in the souvenir program in which he expresses his ignorance of the subject. His questionable assertion that Isadora Duncan left no codified technique overlooks entirely the very principle of personalized creativity she laid down that has made 20th-century dance, including ballet, more than a closed system. Mr. Thorpe's wife, Gillian Freeman, wrote the script that Mr. MacMillan uses as a sequential outline, and she, at least, has used familiar documented source material.

It is so familiar, in fact, that every episode is predictable to anyone who has read the same books, and more, as Miss Freeman. It was obvious then that when a lesbian from the Loie Fuller company makes advances to Isadora, that this duet will be succeeded by one with the Hungarian actor Oscar Beregi, and then with the designer and stage theoretician, Gordon Craig, and so on. When an actress, who is Isadora's speaking double, comes out in a red dress and gives Isadora's famous Boston speech, we know she will actually bare a breast on cue.

Where does the distortion, then, come in? In the lack of balance of the ballet, of course. No one would bother to do a ballet about Isadora Duncan's life merely because she had a series of lovers. It is her stature as an artist that is the reason, but that stature is nonexistent here.

The reply that Mr. MacMillan does, in fact, touch upon her dancing, begs the question. He is, in effect, in danger of confusing a public that may not realize how stylized his version of Duncan dances are and that these are not the real thing.

As an admirer of most of Mr. MacMillan's work, this writer can experience a twinge of distress at his literalness in the duets. Only once does this approach work - in the duet for Isadora and Craig. The choreography is daring in every sense, inventive in its lifts, such as one in which she is swung out and then bisects Craig's body with her legs. Avant-gardists both, they were a very modern couple. Merle Park, who gives a magnificently sustained performance as the dancing Isadora and Julian Hosking as Craig, made this duet as credible and startling as it should be.
