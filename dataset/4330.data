There can be no amnesty for war criminals," Lord Owen, international mediator in the Yugoslav conflict, said last year. "I believe the moral order of this world is marred if those who are guilty of war crimes are not brought to justice."

The U.N. Security Council voted 16 months ago to create a War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. But to date no prosecution has been brought, and many wonder whether any of the murderers and torturers who have ravaged Bosnia will ever be brought to book.

In fact, a good deal of progress has been made in establishing the court and gathering potential evidence. The first indictments are expected by September or October.

The War Crimes Tribunal has 11 judges from around the world, chosen by the General Assembly. The court has adopted rules of evidence and is ready to receive proposed indictments at its seat in The Hague.
