Season 2 Episode 4: ‘Blood in the Streets’

This week’s episode, “Blood in the Streets,” is all about debt. Owing it. Owning it. Pardoning it, and calling it in. It was Baron Rothschild, the 18th-century nobleman who pronounced “The time to buy is when there’s blood in the streets,” after he’d made a fortune buying up property when Napoleon lost at Waterloo. Naomi Klein in her 2007 book “The Shock Doctrine,” argued that capitalism, in the post-9/11 and Hurricane Katrina era of privatization, monetizes disaster and disproportionately benefits the uber rich. Klein wrote:

“It’s easy to imagine a future in which growing numbers of cities have their frail and long-neglected infrastructures knocked out by disasters and then are left to rot [...]. The well-off, meanwhile, will withdraw into gated communities, their needs met by privatized providers.”

“Left to rot,” indeed.

While watching the cold opening of this week’s episode, wherein Nick sneaks around a tent encampment, it was impossible not to note the Hurricane Katrina imagery. It wasn’t so long ago that Americans watched other Americans spell out “Save Us” on their rooftops. Nick then finds his way into a luxurious if empty housing development, where a man, Carlos, is waiting for Strand.

It was in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina that Strand, before the apocalypse and before his good wardrobe, lost his hard won fortune. The son of a strip mall preacher and long-absent mother, Strand came into his own by buying up credit card debt until he had enough to make money in the way people who already have money do: by buying land. It just so happens that he sunk all his money into New Orleans before the city itself was sunk beneath floodwaters.

Enter Thomas Abigail.

Played by Dougray Scott, whom some of you will recognize from the Cinderella fairy tale “Ever After” and others from the Tom Cruise fantasy “Mission Impossible II,” Abigail has what Strand wants: money, power, and more than anything, control. When Abigail catches Strand with his stolen credit cards (lifted during a flirtatious and drunken evening), the businessman proposes something other than jail time to a grateful Strand. But lest you think he’s in the clear, Abigail reminds Strand: “I didn’t pardon you, I obligated you.”
