OMAHA — A man entered the CenturyLink Center on Sunday morning in a T-shirt with “Torres 41” stenciled on the back. Presumably the shirt was 4 years old and referred to the swimmer Dara Torres’s age at the 2008 United States Olympic Trials, since the 1 had been crossed out and replaced by a handwritten 2, then subsequently crossed out for a 3, and then a 4, and then a 5.

The shirt had room for more numerals, but the 45-year-old Torres declared months ago there would be no more comebacks. After surgery on her right shoulder following the 2008 Beijing Games and reconstructive left knee surgery in 2009, Torres will devote herself to other fitness pursuits once she has concluded this bid to make a sixth Olympic swim team, which would extend her American record.

Torres is swimming only one event here at the Olympic Trials, the 50-meter freestyle, and cheers greeted her when she strolled onto the pool deck for preliminaries and semifinals on Sunday.

In the preliminaries, Torres made up ground in the last 20 meters to finish second in the heat and fifth over all in 25.00 seconds. Torres came back to swim 24.80 in the semifinals, third fastest behind Jessica Hardy (24.56) and Christine Magnuson (24.72). The final is Monday night, and Torres must finish first or second to make the team.

“It wasn’t all I’ve got,” she said. “I went a little faster than I hoped, but going faster is always a good thing. I’m ecstatic.”

By the way: Torres is 20 years older than Hardy and 18 years older than Magnuson. And none of the other finalists were alive when Torres swam at her first Olympics in 1984.



Four years ago, Torres stunned the swimming world by winning the 50 and 100 freestyles at the Trials. Even more remarkably, as the oldest swimmer ever to race at the Olympics, she overcame a painful shoulder to take silver in the 50 free. She set an American record that still stands, 24.07 seconds, while finishing just behind Britta Steffen of Germany. Torres added two silvers in relays to give her 12 Olympic medals, tying Jenny Thompson for the most by an American woman. Natalie Coughlin has 11.

Now the shoulder is better, but the knee remains troublesome. It hurts to kick, Torres said, so she surfaces earlier than other swimmers and relies on her upper-body strength to pull her through. Torres said her coach, Bruno Darzi, told her to use her legs more in the semifinal to make sure she advanced.

“It’s much tougher this time around,” Torres said. “People were saying I was middle-aged when I was 41. I’m really middle-aged now.”

And because of her age, Torres said her body can’t recover from hard swims the way it used to. That’s why she didn’t double up in the 100 free, an event with three times the chance of going to London. The top six in the 100 free qualify because it feeds the 4×100 free relay, with the fifth- and sixth-place finishers handling preliminaries for the bigger names.

Entering the 100 and the 50 would have meant two swims a day for three straight days, which Torres considered too demanding.

“I know people say there are six places on the team in the 100,” Torres said. “But I have a hard time swimming twice in a day, let alone three times in two days. It’s much better for me to go for the 50 even though the chances aren’t as great.”

Hardy, the 100 freestyle champion, swam next to Torres in the preliminaries and the semifinals.

“It’s really fun racing Dara,” Hardy said. “She’s an inspiration for me. Just seeing her in such great shape at that age, she’s in better shape than all of us out there.”

Torres’s continued defiance of the calendar inspired a reporter to ask 40-year-old Janet Evans, who emerged from a 14-year retirement to swim the 400 and 800 here but never advanced out of the preliminaries, whether she should have tried shorter races.

“I cannot swim a 200 and a 100 and a 50. Are you kidding me?” Evans said sweetly, and with a smile. “So I never thought of that. I can’t sprint to save my life. I wish I could, but I can’t.”
