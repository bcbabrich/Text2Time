SAIGON, April 30 (UPI)â€”A squad of 10 Communist guerrillas penetrated the capital of Long An Province this week, captured 74 former comrades who had defected, and fled with them, American sources disclosed today.

The raiders managed to capture the defectors without firing a shot in a stealthy operation that United States sources said had dealt the Saigon Government a severe psychological blow.

There was speculation that many of the prisoners would be executed.

According to the report, the 10 guerrillas crept into Tan An shortly after midnight Monday. Tan An is 20 miles from Saigon.

The report of the raid came as the Government announced the release of 2,109 persons who had been held for political reasons. The announcement was made at a ceremony at Cong Hoa Stadium in Saigon that was presided over by Premier Nguyen Khanh. About 1,200 of those who had been detained were present.
