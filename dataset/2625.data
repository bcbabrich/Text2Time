STONINGTON has the kind of reputation that any town would treasure. It is an old-fashioned New England seaport town that still has a fishing fleet and where people from New York and New Jersey snap up second homes for a chance to live in a community that is right out of a Homer Price book.

But over the past year, the town's reputation has darkened. The first selectman just resigned after he was arrested for repeated acts of sexual misconduct with a young girl, a town employee who gambled about $1 million at Foxwoods was arrested in June for embezzling $257,000 from the town, and the Republican registrar of voters died in December after contracting flesh-eating bacteria. The harbormaster died in November after she was hit by a car, then hit again by a second car while she was being treated on the side of the road. The elderly man who ran the local Christmas tree farm was found severely beaten in his bed, then died a few weeks later.

And the bizarre case that still hovers over the town, unsolved, is the death of a beloved second-grade teacher, who was found dead in her home at the bottom of a staircase in 2002. The teacher, Leslie Buck, died just days after she told the police she had escaped a kidnapper, who she identified as a handyman often hired by her husband, Charles. A local barmaid, who bar employees said received expensive gifts from the husband, told the police that Mr. Buck had asked her to run away with him a few hours before his wife's body was found. Last Tuesday, a jury found Russell Kirby, the handyman, guilty of kidnapping the teacher. He faces up to 21 years in prison.

Things like this didn't happen to Homer Price.

''This is still an outstanding community, but it's not the way it once was,'' said Police Chief David Erskine. ''Things are going to happen.''
