Carl Icahn, owner of Meadow Star, an undefeated 2-year-old filly, was named the winner yesterday of the New York Turf Writers Association's John A. Morris Award as the person who did the most for racing during the year.

Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines, announced before Meadow Star's victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies on Oct. 27 at Belmont Park that her future earnings would be donated to the Children's Rescue Foundation for the care and treatment of substance-abusing homeless mothers.

The Red Smith Good Guy Award was given to co-winners, Mary Lou Whitney of the horse racing family and Don La Place, the linemaker for the New York Racing Association. (AP)
