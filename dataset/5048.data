ANY hobbyist can be a No. 1 collector, and today would be a good day to start planning. The reference, of course, is to the first stamps issued by each postal authority. Such a collection is a popular area and, with imagination, need not be expensive.

Many of the stamps, which carry No. 1 in the Scott's catalogues, also carry very high catalogue values, especially those issued in the mid-1800's when the first adhesive stamps were issued. But non-purists can build an attractive collection.

Almost all postal authorities have issued stamps to mark the centenary of their first stamps, and almost all these commemoratives carry the images of those first issues. Few cost more than a dollar or two and together they form the popular topical collection called stamps-on-stamps.

Thus the first Swiss stamp, issued by the cantonal government of Zurich and bearing Scott No. 1L1 (for first local issue) has a catalogue value of $14,000. Both 1L1 and 1L2 were reproduced on a 1943 issue by Switzerland; the catalogue value is 8 cents.
