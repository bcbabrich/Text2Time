To the Editor:

New York's Finest have dusted off an 1845 law to curb demonstrators during the World Economic Forum meeting here this week (''Police Vow Zero Tolerance for Violence at Economic Forum,'' news article, Jan. 29). The law forbids people in groups to wear masks or hoods in public.

Like so much else in our legal code, its roots are English. A British law against public disguise was cited against those unruly Yankee patriots who masqueraded as Mohawks to stage the Boston Tea Party in 1773.
