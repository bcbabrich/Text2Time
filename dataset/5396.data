''Certainly I wasn't in a hurry to run fast after last week, and with the world championships next week,'' Coghlan said. Last week he ran 2,000 meters, longer than a mile.

Of course, the national-indoor-championships record crowd of almost 16,000 wasn't thinking about last week or next. They were hoping to see as fast a race as possible.

They weren't even to know how fast the mile was going, however. The scoreboard timer wasn't operating. Instead, all they saw was ''0:00'' on the board in the one event in which every fan is concerned about the time. Fans had to settle for calls after each quarter over the loudspeaker. But when the race was run, no one, except those who had stopwatches and could use them accurately, even knew that Coghlan had eclipsed 4 minutes again.

Carl Lewis also conceded that he wasn't that concerned about speed -in fact, he said he didn't even care about winning.

''This meet really has nothing to do with anything,'' he said.

''I just want to get on the 11:15 plane back home,'' he said after finishing third in the 55-meter dash. He failed to qualify on the American team for the world indoor championships.

''Even if I had,'' he said, ''the 55-meter to me is just a warm-up for the 100-meter outdoors. I ran indoors to work up my first 60 yards.'' Sour Grapes Attitude? Sour grapes? Perhaps. But he said he planned to start training again on Tuesday for the long jump (in which he captured one of four Olympic gold medals). He underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last November.

If there were other distractions for Sergei Bubka, the world's best pole-vaulter, they could not be discerned so easily. In the warm-ups he corrected the public-address announcer over how many times he had set world records. Bubka then passed a chance to leap at 17 feet 9 1/4 inches, at 18-1 1/4 and 18-5 1/4. The Soviet star, though, then failed three times at 18-9 1/4. He refused to be interviewed later.
