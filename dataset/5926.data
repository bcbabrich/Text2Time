* To the Editor:

Your July 26 editorial on the costs of free concerts suggested that they could just as well be held in a stadium. But the reason they are held in Central Park is that people like to be around growing things once in a while.

It's a different sort of atmosphere.

In theory the park is there to be enjoyed; if it gets damaged, you fix it. If funds are not available for music that draws 350,000 or more people, then what are we all working and building tall glass towers for?

Meanwhile, who gave Henry Stern, the Commissioner of Parks, the authority to decide that The Clash (punk-rock group) can't play in the park (news story July 26)? Seems to me like a lot of power over what we hear and think. DAVE LIPPMAN New York, July 26, 1983
