Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is an astonishing work. But it's easy to forget that, since so many performances are overlaid with political symbolism. For generations, Beethoven's Ninth has been conscripted into service by conductors eager to make grand statements of affirmation: for United Nations Day, to commemorate the Allied victory or to celebrate the tearing down of the Berlin Wall or such.

But Kurt Masur has an infectious belief in the meaning of such gestures and in the message of this choral symphony, with its unabashed call for brotherhood and joy. He also just happens to know a lot about conducting Beethoven. So for the last two years the New York Philharmonic's New Year's Eve performances of Beethoven's Ninth drew packed houses to Avery Fisher Hall.

The hall was sold out again for this New Year's Eve concert, but, since the orchestra never plays on Sundays, the performance took place on Saturday. The blizzard that hit the region just added to the sense of occasion. Naturally, many patrons called in to return their tickets. But plenty of determined Beethoven lovers showed up before the concert to take their places.

It felt good to be part of this hardy audience. If only the Philharmonic could attract this many young people to its subscription concerts. And Mr. Masur assembled a wonderfully diverse roster of performers.
