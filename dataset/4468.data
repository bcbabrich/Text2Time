A BUSINESS thrives on publicity -- good publicity -- but not every one knows how to get it. The owner of a small business may serve as public relations person or may assign the duties to a subordinate who learns, or fails to learn, on the job. A medium-size to large business may have its own person, or staff, to handle publicity or may hire an outside agency.

Publicity Builder, a book-software combination from Jian, formerly Tools for Sales, of Los Altos, Calif., amounts to a course in how to win editors and influence reporters. Every public relations person could benefit from the wisdom of admonitions like these:

"A press release should rarely be longer than two pages."

"Send a fax ONLY if the reporter requests it."

"Always introduce yourself, your company and your product; never assume the reporter remembers you."

The book is an adaptation and expansion of "How to Publicize High Tech Products and Services," by Daniel S. Janal. This version applies to any kind of product or service, although many of the examples are drawn from the computer field and computer-related companies. Mr. Janal is a former reporter and editor who has his own public relations agency. He also conducts training seminars in publicity.
