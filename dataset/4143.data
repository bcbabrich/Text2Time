In an interview, Mr. Chafee, who helped expand Medicaid to reach millions of children and women in the 1980's, said: "I don't want to get into a situation where we're reducing the number of people covered. That could happen if Medicaid is no longer an entitlement."

Medicaid pays for one out of every three births in the United States, finances care for more than a fourth of the country's children and pays for 2 out of every 3 people in nursing homes on any given day. It is much more complex than the main cash assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and costs about six times as much.

In the last 10 years, Federal spending on Medicaid quadrupled, to $82 billion in 1994, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost will rise an average of more than 10 percent a year in the next five years, reaching $148 billion in 2000. Medicaid has become a huge financial burden for the states, which must put up their own money to get Federal Medicaid money. On average, the states contribute 75 cents for each Federal dollar, but those with high per-capita incomes, like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, must match the Federal contribution dollar for dollar.

Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senator Domenici said they had told the governors that they intended to cut Medicaid's current growth rate by half. If the Federal Government held the growth to 5 percent in each of the next five years, it would spend $97 billion less than it expects to spend under current law.

How could such savings be achieved? Governors and Congressional leaders say more Medicaid recipients must be enrolled in health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. They assume that the Federal Government will reduce or eliminate special payments to hospitals serving disproportionate numbers of indigent patients. But ultimately, they say, states may have to impose new restrictions on eligibility or cut coverage of some services.

James D. Bentley, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said he feared that in negotiating with Congress on block grants, each state would "pursue its narrow self-interest, saying 'me first' " as it tried to maximize its share of Federal Medicaid money.

Seven states have received permission from the Federal Government for statewide experiments to control Medicaid costs or expand eligibility, and 10 other states, including New York, have applied for such waivers. But the state experiments are modest by comparison with the block grants being devised in Congress. None of the state programs eliminate the individual entitlement to Medicaid, the bedrock upon which the program has been built for 30 years.
