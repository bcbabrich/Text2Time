The story’s political undercurrent lingered in the 1907 opera it inspired. Composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, it is a cartoonish political satire dressed up as a fairy tale, in which he pushed his usual musical language — highly colored instrumentation, sinuous melodies, folk motifs — to a parodic extreme. “The Russia depicted in this opera is a caricature,” the Princeton musicologist Simon Morrison said in a phone interview, adding that the composer “contrasts this with a fantasy space of the exotic east.” In other words, nothing in “Golden Cockerel” feels remotely real.

Still, the content was troubling enough to alarm the censors and delay its premiere. The opera opened in Moscow in 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov’s death and was picked up a few years later by the Ballets Russes. In that version, from 1914, staged by Michel Fokine, the story was acted out by dancers while the singers and chorus sat in tiers on either side of the stage. The separation of the voice from the body made the similarity to puppet theater even more apparent.

Fokine’s take was also less political, not “a satire on royalty,” he wrote in his memoirs, “but on human frailty and weakness in general.” His characters were puppetlike, in the style of Russian folk art, echoed by the production’s spectacular designs, by the avant-garde painter Natalya Goncharova: brilliantly colored, vehemently two-dimensional, almost childlike. Richard Hudson’s designs for the current production are based on Goncharova’s, though not as exuberant. “I simplified some of the backcloths,” he explained in an email from London, “to achieve a clear, sharp, coherent stage picture.”

In 1937, Fokine created a new, one-act, pure-dance version, without singers. (The designs, again, were by Goncharova.) The cockerel, which had been represented by a prop bird, was now a ballerina on pointe. Extended excerpts were captured on film. (You can see them at the Public Library for the Performing Arts.)

Fast forward to 2012, when the Royal Danish Ballet asked Mr. Ratmansky to create a new work for the company. He was intrigued by the lore surrounding the Fokine staging. “The first knock on the door for me was that Fokine said it’s his best ballet,” said Mr. Ratmansky, who expresses a great love of ballet history. “I thought, it must be a very special thing.” He went back to watch the footage from the 1930s production and was persuaded to give it a try. His own version quotes just a few of Fokine’s movements, particularly in the sharp, jerky choreography for the cockerel. They are like a salute to the ballet’s past.

Mr. Ratmansky’s two-act ballet opened to mixed reviews in Copenhagen in 2012; critics lauded the designs and the characterizations, but some complained that there wasn’t enough dancing. For American Ballet Theater, Mr. Ratmansky has added more. Even so, there is more mime than most contemporary audiences are accustomed to, all in the interest of conveying the fantastical story. The political subtext is not emphasized. “I mean, what do I do, put Putin makeup on the king?” Mr. Ratmansky asked, with a wry laugh. “I wish I could be more daring in that sense, but I don’t see how I can translate that. For me, it’s about the music and visuals and characters.”
