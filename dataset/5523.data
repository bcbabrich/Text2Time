WHEN people ask whether it is proper to combine meats or poultry in the same dish without conflicts in flavor, I am amused. Such combinations occur in kitchens throughout the world. The classic example in French cuisine is chicken or veal Marengo. In the original recipe chicken is combined with tomatoes, olive oil, garlic and crayfish, among other things (like a fried egg on top). The Chinese are famous for combining meat or poultry with seafood; the Portuguese justifiably dote on cataplana, made with pork and clams, and in Spain, paella is almost a national dish, blending chicken, pork, clams and mussels.

I came up with an abbreviated version of paella that can be made in less than an hour's time. I do not boast that it is authentic, but those who sat at my table ate it with enthusiasm.

A piquant accompaniment is an endive and Boston lettuce salad with a mustard and vinegar dressing.
