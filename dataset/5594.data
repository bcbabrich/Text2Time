The Biennale, which opened Sunday in the sweltering heat of Venice, is as ambitious and confused as any in this international art exhibition's long and controversial history. It has a global theme - art and science. With an unprecedented 40 countries represented and with national and theme shows spilling into the city from the Public Gardens, the exhibition's permanent site, it is the largest Biennale so far.

The lifeblood of the exhibition continues to be provided by the national pavilions. In this 42d Biennale, the attention has been focused on four in particular, each devoted to a single artist. The United States pavilion is honoring Isamu Noguchi, the Japanese-American sculptor whose installation of sculpture, lamps and sculptural and environmental models underlines the continuity and unity of his work.

The paintings and drawings by Frank Auerbach that fill the British pavilion were all done in the last eight years. All of the paintings are arenas in which slashing brushstrokes and dense paint battle against an almost classical feeling for structure and composition. The French Conceptual artist Daniel Buren used floor-to-ceiling stripes, some attached to the walls, others hollowed out of them, both to dress up the French pavilion and strip it bare.

One of the pastimes during the week before the official opening was waiting for the German artist Sigmar Polke. The German pavilion was the last of the major pavilions to be completed and the only one to open late for the press. It turned out to be the pavilion most worth waiting for. Polke's declarative and quizzical paintings, riddled and clumped with a bewildering assortment of materials, both reject authority and command an almost reverential respect. Although Polke wants nothing to do with traditional approaches to painting, in their grand gesture, their sense of scale and their understanding of materials, these are the works of a master.
