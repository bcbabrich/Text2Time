Stores that do a lot of their own private-label business in Asia have also benefited from the region's woes, although in many cases any gains are offset by the instability of suppliers, some of whom may not stay afloat. And Asian suppliers who buy their raw materials outside their country are being hammered by the currency ills, raising their costs.

But the savings to consumers are clearly beginning to trickle in. ''We expect to receive price concessions from our existing overseas manufacturers, allowing us to pass on savings to our customers,'' said Terry J. Lundgren, president of Federated Department Stores Inc.'s merchandising unit. Federated owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, as well as other department store chains.

In the consumer electronics business, which has also shown modest price decreases, retailers say that most of the price cuts are in products that have simply lost value with age. Nintendo 64, for example, sold for $249 at Toys ''R'' Us when it first came out; it can now be purchased for half that price.

The Import Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that prices of imported toys and various other electronic goods fell last month. Indeed, between March 1997 and March 1998, import prices of consumer goods (excluding autos) fell nine-tenths of a percent. ''There is a strong correlation between price deflation and deflation in import prices,'' said Edward Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York.

In some cases, while prices may not be falling, retailers are trying to beef up what they are getting for their money. ''There are some opportunities for lower costs,'' said Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for the Dayton Hudson Corporation, ''and we are using that to improve and upgrade quality.'' Some furniture sold at the company's Target discount stores, for instance, will now have extra features for the same price, she said.

Of course, retailers, especially of things like computers and televisions, where margins are razor thin, would love to bolster their balance sheets with these savings. But with rare exception this will not be possible.

Most of the savings are occurring among routine commodity items, where competition is stiff and price is the main draw. ''Retailers are so competitive,'' Mr. Glassman said, ''that if one company gives consumers an edge, everyone else is forced to do it.''
