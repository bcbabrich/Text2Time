When Tony La Russa, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, was told that Ned Yost, the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, said that he would do anything to help them deal with the death of reliever Josh Hancock, La Russa nodded his head in appreciation.

Then La Russa, trying to steer an emotional conversation back to baseball on Monday night, said, “Can they forfeit the three games?”

La Russa smiled. While his team is coping with the loss of one of their own after Hancock was killed in a car accident on Sunday in St. Louis, he knows that the Brewers are playing about as well as anyone in the major leagues.

Going into Tuesday’s games, the Brewers (16-9) are in first place in the National League Central and are tied with the Atlanta Braves for the second-best record in baseball. The Boston Red Sox (16-8) have the best record. The Brewers have already built up a 5 1/2 game lead over the Cardinals (10-14), the defending World Series Champions.

Jeff Suppan (4-2, 2.55 earned run average), who beat his former team on Monday, Chris Capuano (4-0, 3.21 ERA) and Ben Sheets anchor the Milwaukee rotation. The Brewers also have a wealth of talented young players like Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks, J.J. Hardy, Bill Hall and Tony Gwynn, Jr. So far this season, the Brewers have been enthusiastic and fearless.

“Our guys are doing a great job of not getting giddy,” Yost told reporters on Monday. “They go out there every day and play their game. You can’t be jumping up and down. You can’t be going crazy. It’s April. We’ve still got five months to go.”

Yes, they do. But, after one month, the Brewers have looked formidable. Even as La Russa mourned Hancock, he noticed that, too.
