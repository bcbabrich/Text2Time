The Yankees have dominated the number-retirement business over the years. They lead the major leagues in the category, Mattingly's number being the 14th they have taken out of service. No other team has retired more than eight numbers.

Perhaps the most curious part of this kind of day is the gifts the player receives. Despite the millions that players make these days, Mattingly and his family received a car, a pickup truck, two golf carts, five sets of golf clubs, a computer, two airplane tickets to Europe, a 51-inch television set, three video cameras and rings or pendants for all.

The player and the commercial donors of the lavish gifts benefit, but wouldn't it be nicer if charities could be the recipients of such largesse?

A collection of former teammates and older Yankees were on hand to help Mattingly celebrate this once-in-a-lifetime day. Invited from a guest list designed by Mattingly himself, Bill (Moose) Skowron and Hank Bauer were there because Mattingly ''fell in love with those guys'' at a fantasy camp he once worked; Willie Randolph, Rich (Goose) Gossage, Jim (Catfish) Hunter and Graig Nettles because he ''learned how to play from them''; Dave Righetti because Mattingly had ''tremendous respect'' for him and because Righetti ''made me feel comfortable''; Mike Pagliarulo because he ''played so hard'' and ''I loved being across the infield from him,'' and Wayne Tolleson because he played with the same intensity as Pagliarulo.

One person Mattingly invited who was not there was Yogi Berra, the manager who made Mattingly an everyday first baseman. Berra, the guest of honor said, had to be in California, but Mattingly knows that Berra, whose own number was retired in 1972, has said he will boycott Yankee Stadium as long as George Steinbrenner lives there.

''I was trying to make it real easy for him to come back,'' Mattingly said. ''I didn't want to see him stay away from the Stadium. He deserves to be here.''

Mattingly, after a two-year hiatus, disclosed that he will not remain apart from the Yankees much longer. He said he hopes to be an instructor in spring training next year, then work out a way that will enable him to work with the system's young first basemen and hitters.
