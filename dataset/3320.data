In a culture of silence, words can be weapons. In perhaps no contemporary state has the written word proved more threatening than in Saudi Arabia, where sins, sources of shame and sometimes even accomplishments tend to be hidden away.

So it was with a determined lack of fanfare nearly a decade ago that Prince Khaled bin Sultan, the Saudi media baron and former co-commander of the military coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, opened a front in the cultural war against silence in his country, even as he prepared to lead the multinational forces into battle to free Kuwait.

In September 1990, the prince quietly agreed to finance an ambitious project by a group of Saudi scholars to document the country's rich cultural heritage and traditions before they disappeared. Ten years and several million dollars later, the Encyclopedia of Folklore of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a 12-volume, Arabic-language compendium of a vanishing way of life, has just been printed in Belgium. Its authors say that the series, which includes 5,000 drawings, illustrations and graphs, is the largest body of secular scholarship ever produced in Saudi Arabia. It includes separate volumes on topics like historical and archaeological sites, traditional medicine, geography, even children's games. And there is an entire volume devoted to the camel.

While Prince Khaled said he had contemplated such a project for two years before the gulf war, the conflict was the project's main catalyst. ''The widespread ignorance of Saudi Arabia and its cultural heritage, not just among foreigners but among younger Saudis made me determined to try and document and preserve our traditions before it was too late,'' he said in a telephone interview.
