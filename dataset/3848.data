She ended up at Harvard University, in culture shock. ''I spent the first week almost locked in my room,'' Ms. Charo said. For once, she had bought clothes to replace her hand-me-downs. But, she said, ''we're talking Kmart.''

Appearance was only part of it. ''I really didn't know how to behave,'' Ms. Charo said. The other freshmen ''kept talking about things I had no experience with.'' They spoke about vacations in Europe when she had never been on an airplane.

''To me, Europe was 'the other side.' That was the immigrant phrase.''

Soon, she said, she retreated to what had worked in Flatbush, her own version of cool. Her attitude was, ''I'm rough and tough from Brooklyn with a chip on my shoulder.'' Ms. Charo cringes to think about it. ''I was so irritating to everyone,'' she recalled. ''I was so tedious. I'm just grateful that some of the friends I made stuck with me as I worked through this stage.''

Inspired by her junior high school teacher, she majored in biology. ''If Mr. Miller is still out there, he should know that he's the man who determined the course of my life,'' Ms. Charo said. But her first two years were a struggle as she gradually learned how to study and what was required to get good grades at Harvard.

After a few summers in biology laboratories, and a few too many laboratory courses, Ms. Charo finally admitted to herself that she just did not enjoy that kind of work, and drifted into a major that she felt was still acceptable: behavioral evolution and evolutionary theory. At the same time, she took some law courses and was fascinated, but wary, and almost embarrassed to think about becoming a lawyer.

''To me, law school was a real drop in status from science,'' Ms. Charo said. ''I thought that scientists were the only people who create something new. Everyone else is massaging existing data.''

Torn between law school and graduate school, she compromised -- she took the Law School Admissions Test and the Graduate Record Exam. Her score on the Graduate Record Exam, used by graduate schools in deciding whom to admit, was ''respectable,'' Ms. Charo said. Her score on the law school examination, she said, was ''stellar.''
