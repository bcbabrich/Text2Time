KABUL, Afghanistan — Samsor Dawlatzai, a part-time laborer, settled in after dinner Monday night to watch a television interview with the American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad.

The envoy had just mentioned reaching a peace agreement “in principle” with the Taliban when Mr. Dawlatzai’s house collapsed on top of him, his family and his guests. A suicide truck bombing nearby left eight people in the house bloodied and battered, among them a 1-year-old boy, five women and a guest lacerated by flying glass as he prayed.

“What peace are you talking about?” Mr. Dawlatzai asked Tuesday, referring to Mr. Khalilzad.

Mr. Dawlatzai, 23, had the misfortune of living near Green Village, a fortified compound of foreign nationals that had been rocked by bombings in the past. The latest attack, on Monday night, destroyed or badly damaged dozens of nearby shops and homes, killing up to 30 people and wounding at least 100, security officials said.

The police in Kabul said Wednesday that six foreign nationals were killed in Monday’s attack – five Nepalese and one Romanian.
