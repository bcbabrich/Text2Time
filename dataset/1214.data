Pia Sundhage is taking her tactics, her teaching and her singing voice home to Sweden.

Hours before the United States women’s national team opened its post-Olympic victory tour with an 8-0 thrashing of Costa Rica in Rochester, Sundhage announced that she was stepping down as the team’s coach to pursue a job in her native Sweden.

Her new post was cleared up before the sun set: Sweden’s football association announced on its Web site Saturday night that it had hired Sundhage to coach its women’s national team. She will start her new post on Dec. 1, according to the Swedish F.A.

“I have long dreamed of becoming Sweden coach and now I am so happy,” she said.

Hours earlier, she reflected on the end of her tenure with the United States team.

“It was an honor to be able to coach these players for five years, and I learned a tremendous amount from them,” Sundhage said. “I want to thank all the players and all of my assistant coaches for making me better. Before I took this job, I always admired the spirit and character of the U.S. team, but to experience that first-hand on the training field and from the bench as their coach was truly special and something I will treasure for the rest of my life. Although it is time to move on, I’d like to thank U.S. Soccer for this wonderful opportunity and I wish this team and the players all the best in the future.”

Her decision to leave was not a complete surprise; Sundhage’s contract was up after this year, and in an interview last year she had expressed interest in returning to Sweden.

“After the Olympics we had discussions and early in the process it became clear that Pia was very interested in returning home to Sweden,” U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati said in a statement. “It certainly wasn’t an easy decision for U.S. Soccer or Pia. She deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the amazing success the U.S. Women’s National Team had during the past five years.”

Sundhage’s tenure has unquestionably been a successful one, though the United States failed to win the Women’s World Cup with her at the helm. Sundhage has compiled a record of 89-6-10 and won 11 tournament titles, including two Olympic golds. She also helped patch together a team in transition after its disastrous finish at the 2007 World Cup in China, when Hope Solo turned on her backup and her coach after losing her starting role and the American veterans responded by essentially shunning her.

Sundhage put that broken team back together and led it to the Olympic gold medal a year later, saw it lose on penalties in the 2011 World Cup final, then won gold again at the London Olympics this summer. For that, she will be remembered as one of the top coaches in the team’s history (granted, six is a small group, but still …).

Better than Anson Dorrance and Tony DiCicco, who each won World Cups? That’d be a tough sell, though Sundhage led the team in what one could argue was a much more competitive era. That might have been what U.S. Soccer officials were trying to convey in Saturday’s announcement. This line in particular from the U.S. Soccer news release ought to go over really well with the Hamm-Lilly-Foudy-Chastain crowd (my emphasis):

During her five years on the job Sundhage helped the U.S. team continue to evolve its style of play technically and tactically in the increasingly competitive environment of women’s international soccer. Her tenure culminated in two of the team’s best tournaments ever – the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Germany and the 2012 Olympics — in terms of the quality of play on the field and excitement generated by the matches.

It’s almost as if the author got halfway through that sentence and suddenly realized what it was saying.
