On the first day of his trial on treason charges, the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan apologized for his past and said he would call for an end to guerrilla violence if the Turkish authorities would give him the chance to turn his army into a civilian political party.

Speaking with rising emotion, Mr. Ocalan admitted that he and his fighters were responsible for all the killings and other acts attributed to them by prosecutors, and added, ''I could list many more you haven't mentioned.'' But he said he had come to believe that his approach to solving the country's ethnic problems was ''a dead-end street.''

''Now is the time to end this conflict, or else it will get much worse,'' he said. ''I want to dedicate my life to bringing Turks and Kurds together.''

There have long been complaints from Kurds, a distinct ethnic group in Turkey and neighboring countries, about official suppression of their language and culture. The Kurdish guerrillas have been at war with the Turkish Government for 15 years, a struggle that according to various estimates has taken more than 30,000 lives and cost Ankara $100 billion.
