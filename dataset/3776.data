Senator Lott said earlier in the week that he was concerned that some of Ms. Herman's activities might have come ''awfully close to the edge'' of Federal laws that limit the partisan activities of Government workers. After meeting with Ms. Herman today, the Senator said: ''It was a good meeting. She answered a number of questions I had concerns about.''

But he added, ''I still think there is a lot of explanation needed.''

The most controversial issue has been the role of Ms. Herman's aides in inviting a Federal bank regulator to meet with Mr. Clinton and some of the nation's most powerful bankers at a coffee meeting sponsored by the Democratic Party last May. White House spokesmen have said that Ms. Herman's office was involved only because of a miscommunication about the nature of the event, and that Ms. Herman decided not to go to the coffee after she learned it was being sponsored by party officials.

But the controversy has also focused a broader spotlight on the public liaison office, which promotes grass-roots support for the President's social and economic policies among ethnic, business and civic groups, and how the Administration has used it.

Several people who worked in that office in previous Administrations, both Democratic and Republican, said in interviews that officials of the liasion office have historically not had an extensive involvement with party operatives, especially during election campaigns.

Anne Wexler, who ran the liaison office under President Jimmy Carter and whose son works for Ms. Herman now, said she occasionally asked the Democratic National Committee if there were any donors it would like her to include in large groups -- usually of 200 or more people -- invited to White House briefings. But she said Mr. Carter rarely met with small groups, and her office was ''never connected in any way with fund raising.''
