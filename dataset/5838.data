A West German businessman was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport today for allegedly attempting to export a United States-manufactured electronic circuit board system without a license, the Commerce Department said.

Michael Hans Ludwig, 53 years old, was preparing to board an aircraft for Munich, West Germany, when he was arrested by export enforcement officers and Customs agents, the department said.

He was charged with violation of United States national security export controls, according to a department statement.

The electronic circuit board system he was carrying has military applications, sensory devices and robotics, and the required export license had not been obtained, the statement said.
