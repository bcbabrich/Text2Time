Geraldine A. Ferraro's 22-year-old daughter, Donna Zaccaro, was heckled and booed when she criticized President Reagan's policies at a fund-raising party to welcome back the ''Doonesbury'' comic strip, an organizer said today.

Jan Hollingsworth, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Children, which benefited from the dinner, said her organization was not aware that Miss Zaccaro's comments would include a strong attack on the President.

''It started out with quiet boos after they realized she was getting into a heavy topic,'' Mrs. Hollingsworth said.

Miss Zaccaro defended the criticism she expressed Saturday night of Mr. Reagan at the $250-a-plate dinner and said the overall response was positive. She said it was ''unfortunate'' if there was an organizer who did not know her subject matter would be political.
