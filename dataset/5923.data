Indian Summer In the City

'Shorakkopoch,'' reads the brass

marker on the boulder in Inwood Hill Park. The word means ''the waiting place,'' an urban park ranger explained to visitors yesterday - the place where the Reckgawanc Indians of Upper Manhattan waited for low tide to wade the Harlem River.

Near the marker, an encampment of youngsters worked on Indian handicrafts, wearing headbands and beaded necklaces they had made. And deeper still into the cool woods, under towering walls of Manhattan schist, children crawled into old Indian caves and emerged with tales to tell.

''All wet leaves and spider webs, and I didn't know if I could get out,'' reported 9-year-old David Russo, one of six Russo cousins gathered together from Rockville Centre, L.I., and Great Kills, S.I.

It was the last day of the Urban Park Rangers' first Native American Weekend, being held in seven parks in five boroughs. Flushing Meadows- Corona Park in Queens offered games and cookery of the Mattinecocks, Rockaways and Massapequas. Staten Island celebrated the basketry and lore of the Leni Lenape. The modern tribes were out, too, in Inwood: the tennis, softball and stickball players, the tricyle riders, the bench sitters, the family picnickers. But Fernando, Gigi and Noel Ramos, aged 8 to 13, learned from the rangers that the soccer field used to be a Reckgawanc Indian cornfield.
