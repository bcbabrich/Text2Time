According to the report, when Prime Minister Zhou Enlai was seriously ill in 1975, Mr. Deng took charge with Mao's support and tried to undo some of the chaos caused by the Cultural Revolution and the so-called Gang of Four, the name given to Mao's radical associates, including his wife, Jiang Qiang, who have since been purged.

Mr. Deng presided over various meetings and ''the situation took an obvious turn for the better,'' the report states. ''However,'' it goes on, ''Comrade Mao Zedong could not bear to accept systematic correction of the errors of the Cultural Revolution by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Second Purge Is Recalled

Mao was said to have attacked Mr. Deng as a ''right deviationist'' and once again plunged the nation into turmoil. The report says Mao purged Mr. Deng a second time in 1976 after the Tian An Men incident in which thousands of supporters of Zhou, who had died in January 1976, turned out in defiance of orders at a wreath-laying and memorial demonstration. The report says Mao did not recognize that this was a demonstration against the Gang of Four.

''In essence, the movement was a demonstration of support for the party's correct leadership as represented by Deng Xiaoping,'' the report says. ''It laid the ground for massive popular support for the subsequent overthrow of the counterrevolutionary Jiang Qing clique.''

It was only after Mao's death and the purge of the Gang of Four that Mr. Deng was again returned to the leadership in the summer of 1977.

In discussing an earlier stormy period known as the Great Leap Forward, the report says that Mao and others became ''smug'' in 1958 over their economic successes and launched the Great Leap and other economic policies that ''overlooked objective economic laws.''

The Great Leap, a crash program of economic development in 1959-60 leading to the withdrawal of Soviet economic aid, caused ''serious losses to our country and people,'' the report says.
