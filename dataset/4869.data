"People come here from all over the city. It's important to keep it going. It's the kind of education I believe in."

Hooker's reputation is so strong that out-of-district families are regularly turned away for lack of room. Many are drawn by the rich diversity of the student body. Over a third of the students, about 90 children, come from abroad -- from Norway and Nigeria, Yugoslavia and Venezuela, China, Korea and Japan. Mr. Angeletti said that some families have opted for Hooker over private schools in the city. Many of these families come to New Haven because one or both parents are Yale graduate students. Often they must leave before their children reach the fourth grade. 'A Good Foundation'

Recently Nwabata Oputa, from Nigeria, celebrated her sixth birthday in Mary Burns's first-grade class. The happy occasion was tinged with sadness, because the little girl's mother, Alexandra Oputa, explained that the family was moving to the South in the winter.

"Bata got a good foundation here," her mother said. "She was blessed to have wonderful teachers." When the family moves, Hooker will lose one of its faithful cafeteria volunteers.

"Many want to stay but can't," said Mrs. Burns who has taught in the New Haven school system for 29 years, 12 of them at Hooker. "Most only stay two or three years. This school is special."

The children said they valued their diverse classmates. "I have special friends from Korea and China," said Leah Pillsbury, a fourth grader. Her friend Emily Williams reported, "Foreign students are cool, especially because I got to tutor a Chinese boy in reading." For tiny Terri Ramiah, a first grader from Malaysia, Hooker is special because, "they give you books to read, and it is not as hot as home, 100 degrees."

The school has a teacher who works full time with children who need help in mastering English. The teacher, Joan R. Carroll, meets with each of her charges 30 minutes a day.
