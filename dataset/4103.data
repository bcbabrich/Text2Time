Just as there was more to sports in 1994 than the Rangers winning and the World Series vanishing, there was more to sports books than the bound version of Ken Burns's "Baseball." Various members of the Times sports department offer what they consider were some of the best sports books published in 1994. OCTOBER 1964 David Halberstam (Villard Books, $24).

An intriguing sociology of an era told through a season. Halberstam uses the classic 1964 Yankees-Cardinals World Series to trace the demise of the Yankees empire, largely due to the franchise's failure to grasp the implications of Jackie Robinson and the integration of major league baseball. The Cardinals became something of a model of integration during the mid-60's. WILLIAM C. RHODEN
