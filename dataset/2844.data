To the Editor:

Your Oct. 25 editorial opposing the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated that the American Bar Association is ''all but a rubber stamp for the administration's nominees.'' That is not the case.

The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary evaluates a nominee only with respect to integrity, judicial temperament and experience. Its 15 members are independent, and carefully and exhaustively conduct scores of confidential interviews with judges, lawyers and public officials before making a recommendation. This process is impartial.

The committee does not evaluate ideology, or whether a nominee's opinions are in or out of the mainstream. That evaluation is for the president and the Senate.
