In 1974, 4-year-old Brenda Probasco was found dead 16 miles from her home here in Gloucester County. Now, a former neighbor has been charged with her murder.

Though Edwin C. Blood, 51, was an early suspect, the authorities said they did not have enough evidence to charge him until he confessed to New Jersey State Police detectives while being questioned recently at a New Hampshire prison. Mr. Blood was nearing the end of 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to molesting another girl.
