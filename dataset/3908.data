To the Editor:

Owen Harries's Oct. 26 Op-Ed article acknowledges the harmfulness of United States interventions in Central America and the Caribbean, but still calls them ''well intentioned.''

I'm puzzled about where Mr. Harries finds evidence of these good intentions. Perhaps he sees them in Woodrow Wilson's pronouncements about ''our peculiar duty'' to teach the natives ''order and self-control.''

United States actions spoke more frankly: the main goals of invasions of the region were to discourage economic inroads by Europe and Japan and to prop up governments friendly to the United States and overthrow unfriendly ones.

President William Howard Taft expressed the driving motivation in 1912: ''The day is not far distant when three Stars and Stripes at three equidistant points will mark our territory: one at the North Pole, another at the Panama Canal, and the third at the South Pole. The whole hemisphere will be ours in fact as, by virtue of our superiority of race, it already is ours morally.''
