The agent in charge of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration in New York City and a top undercover agent for it are leaving the D.E.A. with harsh words about Federal drug policy, saying that it is ill conceived and that the Government's operations abroad are futile.

Both men, who are retiring after 25 years as Federal agents, said they had long harbored objections to the way several Administrations in Washington had attacked the drug problem but had been unable to speak out publicly while in Government service.

Robert M. Stutman, who retires today as special agent in charge of the 500-agent D.E.A. office in New York City, said the Bush Administration's emphasis on stopping drugs at the borders and on paramilitary operations abroad had not stemmed the flow of drugs into the nation's neighborhoods.

In an interview on Monday, Mr. Stutman, who is 46 years old, said leaders in Washington are underfinancing drug-treatment and drug-education programs because, he said, they consider them to be undramatic policies that can show results only over the long term and that do not have the immediate political appeal of ''agents knocking down doors and aircraft carriers off the coast of Colombia.''
