North Korea's rush to remove the spent fuel rods from the reactor raises two concerns. One is that by unloading the fuel rods without segregating some for future assay, it could be trying to keep inspectors from learning about its nuclear past. That past includes a 100-day period in 1989 when the reactor was shut down and some spent fuel was diverted -- two bombs' worth by one worst-case estimate. The assays would help the inspectors determine how long and at what power the reactor was operating and thus how much spent fuel it should have produced. The assays could also help determine whether any of the original fuel rods were replaced; the plutonium extracted from them could end up in bombs.

A second, even greater, concern is that the spent fuel now being removed will itself be diverted to bomb-making, giving North Korea enough material from this batch of fuel to make perhaps four or five bombs. At the moment inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency see no sign of that. But as long as the spent fuel remains at Yongbyon, inspectors will need access to assure that no diversion occurs. So far the North has permitted that access.

North Korea has long sought a resumption of high-level bilateral talks with the United States in an effort to gain diplomatic recognition and increased trade and investment. But Washington has set two critical conditions for holding the talks. The North has thus far satisfied one condition by allowing inspectors and cameras to monitor the current removal of fuel rods to prevent diversion to weapons programs and allowing them to complete work it interrupted in March -- work that would verify that it has not diverted any spent fuel or reprocessed plutonium in the past year.

But North Korea is dangerously close to making it impossible to meet the second condition -- that nothing be done to preclude analyses that could determine whether fuel was diverted earlier, particularly in the suspect 1989 period. Indeed, when Washington tried to schedule the high-level talks for this week, the North proposed a later date and accelerated removal of the fuel rods without setting any aside for later sampling.

Time is running out for the kind of diplomacy the U.S. has pursued. If the North stays on its present course, by week's end the world will face an unpalatable choice: Live with the possibility that North Korea may have diverted two bombs' worth of plutonium in the past, or move to sanctions. Pyongyang should recognize that the Clinton Administration and its South Korean allies will be under enormous pressure to impose sanctions, even if that leads the North to bar inspectors and make more bombs.
