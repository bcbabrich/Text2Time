Bosnian Government leaders today criticized the United States and four other major powers for failing to take decisive action against the Bosnian Serbs for rejecting a peace plan.

In Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia recommended that Bosnian Serb leaders reverse their rejection of the peace proposal, which would require the Serbs to acknowledge Bosnia's sovereignty, at least temporarily, and hand back a third of the territory they have captured and "ethnically cleansed."

At a meeting in Geneva on Saturday, the foreign ministers from the so-called "contact group" countries -- the United States, Germany, France, Great Britain and Russia -- warned that they would, among other things, press the United Nations Security Council to tighten spottily enforced economic sanctions against Serbia because of the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the peace plan. But the five countries avoided tougher measures like a renewed threat of air strikes. U.N. Review Scheduled

The Security Council is expected to consider the foreign ministers' recommendation in about a week.

At a news conference today, members of Bosnia's Muslim-led Government used words like "disappointing" and "indecisive" to describe the contact group's response to the Serbs' rejection of the plan.
