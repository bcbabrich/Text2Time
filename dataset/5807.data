Check-In Arrangements. Almost all airlines have special check-in counters for first-class passengers at major airports. Most also have a private lounge that is either exclusively for first-class passengers or also used by dues-paying members of the airline's club. Drinks and snacks are available there, often free, and you can relax or do paperwork until your flight is called.

Aboard the Plane. On jumbo jetliners, first-class passengers generally board last and are the only ones permitted into the first-class compartment, which usually is just behind the cockpit or, on some 747's, on the upper deck. On smaller aircraft, however, economy-class passengers must sometimes pass through first class to get to their seats.

First-class passengers are seated two abreast, often with pairs of seats on each side of the cabin for a total of four across, compared with 9 or 10 across in the economy class of jumbos. On short domestic flights, however, the first-class compartment may be so small that cigarette smoke from the rear seats may disturb nonsmokers to the front.

On long-distance flights, first-class seats usually recline to an angle of 50 to 62 degrees, with about five feet between rows; often legrests are also provided. (On the Concorde, a narrow-body jet that carries only 100 passengers, the seating configuration is tighter, but a trans-Atlantic trip takes only three and a half hours. On trans-Pacific flights of Philippine Airlines, the upper deck of the 747 has 14 beds. Japan Air Lines has five berths on some trans-Pacific flights - but not from New York - at a 20 percent surcharge above the first-class fare.) Pampering begins as soon as the passenger is seated, often with a glass of Champagne. (Air-India, for example, has one attendant for every four first-class passengers.) A hot towel may be provided, as well as a pair of slippers, eyeshades and maybe even a robe on long flights. Gifts include chocolates on Qantas and Swissair and Swedish glass objects on Scandinavian Airlines System. Most airlines also distribute a gift deemed appropriate to the flight, which on T.W.A. may mean an overnight kit with toiletries for eastbound trans-Atlantic flights and a business portfolio with a calculator and stapler for those going westward. A recent Alitalia overnight kit for men included cologne, a comb and nail file in a case, tubes of bath gel and shampoo, a bar of soap in a plastic case, a hand towel, a disposable razor, shaving cream, a sewing kit and a ballpoint pen.

Food and Beverages. The menu given passengers in Aer Lingus's Golden Shamrock service, which is what the company calls its first class, says, ''Togha gach bi is rogha gach di.'' As translated from the Gaelic by Patrick M. Hanrahan, the company's public relations officer in New York, it means ''The best in food and drink to you'' - which is what airlines like to discuss most when promoting first class.

The longer the flight and the more competitive the route, the more elaborate the food and drinks. Most airlines stock the major premium brands of spirits and soft drinks, often with local specialties such as Irish whisky on Aer Lingus and aquavit on S.A.S. They also usually stock fine wines and Champagnes or the local equivalent. (On Saudi Arabian Airlines, however, expect superb Arabian coffee and soft drinks but, in accordance with Islamic law, nothing alcoholic.) If time permits, meals are served course by course, usually with fine china, glassware and silverware. To illustrate how elaborate the menus can be, the following was a recent dinner selection on Swissair between New York and Geneva: hors d'oeuvres; Caspian Sea caviar; consomme with cheese toast or cream of chicken soup; salad; sirloin steak with bearnaise sauce, pork chop with vegetables or fillet of sole and scampi with shrimps; potatoes or rice and a choice of vegetables; assorted cheeses and fruits; cheesecake or strawberry ice cream with liqueur and double cream; coffee and liqueurs, and Swiss chocolates.

Arrival. First-class passengers usually leave the plane first, and their checked baggage, which typically is loaded last, is removed first. This gives these passengers a decided headstart on domestic flights, but on international arrivals, they have to go through customs and immigration procedures just like anyone else, unless they are important enough in their own right to warrant special treatment. They get a headstart on other passengers from their flight, but could find themselves at the end of a line of passengers from flights that arrived earlier.

Hotel Offerings. Some airlines offer first-class passengers a free or reduced-rate night at a hotel upon arrival at their destination or while awaiting a connection. Some offer it only to connecting passengers who cannot get their next flight until the following day. A creative travel agent, on request, may be able to arrange for you to miss a same-day connection if you would like to linger overnight in London, for example.
