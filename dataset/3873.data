Vlada Stevanic, bare-chested and wearing a faded pair of shorts, walked slowly through his cow pasture until he stood in front of a gaping hole in the ground.

''There,'' the Bosnian Serb farmer said, as if the huge pit could be missed. ''We were all in bed when the missile landed, blowing out the windows in our house. It was like an earthquake. Now NATO says it has come here to help us. But none of us trust NATO. How can we trust anyone who tried killed us?''

The Tomahawk cruise missile strike, which took place in September 1995 and killed one of Mr. Stevanic's goats, was part of the two-week bombing campaign by NATO forces to end the Bosnian Serb siege of Sarajevo.

NATO warplanes blasted military installations and gun emplacements throughout Serbian-held Bosnia, severely crippling the Bosnian Serb military and laying the foundation for the Dayton peace agreement. This missile strike, about two miles off target, was part of an attack on the television transmitter on Mount Kozara, in northwestern Bosnia, as well as the nearby military barracks. The transmitter, which was replaced seven months after the air strike, and the barracks were demolished. The barracks remain a tangled shell of brick, cement and undergrowth. The new transmitter, controlled by supporters of Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb president who continues to hold de facto power from his stronghold in Pale, is one of the installations that backers of his rival and nominal successor, President Biljana Plavsic, hope to seize.
