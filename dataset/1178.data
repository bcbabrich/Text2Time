DETROIT — Joe Torre managed Russell Martin for three seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers. But his phone call to Martin, the Yankees’ catcher, on Thursday was not to say hello or ask about his Carolina blue sneakers.

As major league baseball’s executive vice president for baseball operations, Torre is responsible for discipline and umpiring. Torre wanted to hear Martin’s version of the snit with the plate umpire Laz Diaz on Wednesday night in Anaheim, when Martin questioned some pitches and Diaz declined to hand him new baseballs to throw back to the pitcher. Martin claimed Diaz told him he had to earn the privilege.

Martin said he returned Torre’s call Friday before the Yankees faced the Tigers at soggy Comerica Park. Torre had already spoken to Diaz, Martin said.

“He wanted to hear both sides of the story,” Martin said. “It’s not a major issue. It’s more childish than anything else.”

Yankees Manager Joe Girardi, a former catcher, said Friday he had never heard of an umpire penalizing a catcher in that way. “I’m glad it’s over with, just kind of let the league handle it,” Girardi said. “I know Russell was frustrated by it. Let it die, and we’ll move on, and the league will handle it the way they’re going to handle it.”

Martin likes to toss new balls to the mound to keep his arm loose, especially with men on base. Girardi understood why Martin made an issue of it. “It’s a guy’s personal preference,” he said. “As athletes, very seldom are we going to back down, either.”

It is not clear whether Torre might discipline Diaz for his actions or Martin for speaking out. Martin brought up the conflict with reporters after the game without being asked about it. He used an expletive in referring to Diaz, and his comments included, “I know he can hold a grudge with the best of them.”

Friday, Girardi brushed off questions about possible reprisals by Diaz or other umpires.

“We may not see him for three months,” Girardi said. “I’m not concerned. And I’m sure baseball will watch, and he understands that, too.”

Said Martin: “I just hope to get to throw the ball back to pitcher next time. I don’t think it’s going to be an issue, unless you guys write about it every day.”

Young Returns to New York The last time the Yankees and the Tigers met, in late April at Yankee Stadium, Delmon Young spent the entire series on the restricted list after being arrested in the early morning April 27. Young was charged with aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor, after an altercation with four men outside the New York Hilton Hotel in midtown.

The Tigers had flown in from Detroit the night of the 26th after a day game at Comerica Park. The police said an apparently intoxicated Young yelled an anti-Semitic remark and tackled one of the men. The Tigers put Young on the restricted list the next day. He later drew a seven-day suspension without pay from Major League Baseball and apologized for his conduct.

Young returned to New York last Tuesday morning for a brief hearing, then rejoined the Tigers in Boston and went 1-for-4 that night in a 6-3 loss to the Red Sox. He is due back in court on Aug. 2.

Since the suspension, Young has hit .265 (26 for 98) with 3 homers and 14 runs batted in, raising his season average to .256 from 242 heading into Friday. All the home runs have come since May 18. Young was in Detroit’s starting lineup Friday night, batting fifth.

Robertson to Throw Off Mound David Robertson (strained left oblique) will throw off a bullpen mound for the first time Saturday or Sunday in Tampa, Girardi said, a key step in Robertson’s recovery from a strained left oblique. Girardi said Robertson was supposed to play catch Thursday but could not because of rain.

Girardi said Brett Gardner (strained right elbow) took batting practice in the covered cages in Tampa.

Neither player is close to returning to the active roster.

Anniversary for Jeter Friday marked the 20th anniversary of the Yankees drafting Derek Jeter out of Kalamazoo Central High School as the sixth overall pick. “Twenty years goes way too fast is probably what comes to mind the most,” Girardi said with a laugh. The five players chosen ahead of Jeter: third baseman Phil Nevin (Houston), pitcher Paul Shuey (Cleveland), pitcher B.J. Wallace (Montreal), outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds (Baltimore), and outfielder Chad Mottola (Cincinnati).
