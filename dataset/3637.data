Seagram Americas has expanded its relationship with Grey Advertising in New York by naming the agency to handle creative and media assignments for Seagram's VO Canadian whisky, American media services for Seagram's 7 Crown whisky and electronic media buying for most of its spirits brands. Billings were not disclosed.

Grey was selected to handle the VO and 7 Crown duties after a three-month review that also included other Seagram roster agencies. Those assignments had been handled by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, part of WPP Group, which continues to handle the worldwide Martell Cognac account for Seagram.

Grey was awarded the electronic media buying assignment without a review; it had been been handled by various roster agencies including Grey. Grey also handles various assignments for Seagram brands like Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum, Crown Royal Canadian whisky and Myers's Original Dark Jamaican Rum.
