Once again, as they say, they wuz robbed.

Longtime Brooklyn Dodgers fans have been pushing in recent years for the baseball Hall of Fame to induct Gil Hodges, the team's beloved first baseman who later, as manager, guided the 1969 Mets to a World Series championship. But yesterday, they learned that Hodges had been passed over again.

Wait till next year?

Actually, fans of Hodges have been doing just that for the last 30 years, and many said that this year, with its lack of strong contenders, was their idol's best chance to get into the hall. Many fan organizations and even Hodges's widow, Joan, campaigned tirelessly to foster a groundswell of support to sway the members of the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, which selects new members.

More than 40 years after he last played in Ebbets Field, Hodges still has a particularly strong following in the city, which has named a bridge, a Little League, and a school after him.

His wife continues to live in the Brooklyn home the couple bought 40 years ago, and yesterday, family members gathered at her Flatbush house to commiserate.
