To the Editor:

The online headline for a Sunday Review news analysis on June 25 was “Men Don’t Want to Be Nurses. Their Wives Agree.”

I can say that after 40 years nursing continues to be a fulfilling profession, and my wife agrees. My son, my soon-to-be son-in-law and my nephew value their decision to become nurses, as do their spouses.

Men should look at nursing as a career choice that provides security while offering a continuously rewarding opportunity in specialties like palliative, primary, trauma and critical care, where nurses ease suffering and make a true difference in people’s lives.
