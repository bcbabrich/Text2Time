The questions were given added impetus when Mr. Motley this morning abruptly canceled a speech he was to have delivered tonight before the Council on Foreign Relations. The speech was entitled ''Consistency and Constancy - Keys to a Successful Central America Policy.''

'Not a Surprise to the President'

Meanwhile, President Reagan weighed the possibility of imposing trade sanctions against Nicaragua, a step many senior State Department officials, in interviews over the last several years, have frequently said they strongly oppose.

But Mr. Motley and Mr. Shultz vigorously denied today that a policy disagreement had led to Mr. Motley's resignation, and a senior State Department official said Mr. Motley had endorsed the idea of trade sanctions during an interagency meeting on the matter on Monday.

Mr. Shultz said Mr. Motley had told him several months ago that he intended to resign. And Mr. Motley, in an interview, said his resignation ''may be a surprise to you, but it is not a surprise to the President or'' to Mr. Shultz.

Mr. Shultz, speaking to reporters today, said he asked Mr. Motley to remain in the job at least until Congress voted on renewed aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, or contras. The votes took place last week.
