At the same time, however, it acknowledged the difficulties that could arise in bringing such a case to trial, when large amounts of classified information might have to be disclosed.

Problems of Security

In the past, both President Carter and Attorney General Griffin B. Bell have said that legitimate problems of “national se curity” might arise from any attempt td prosecute Mr. Helms and that President Carter would make the final decision on whether classified information could be made available for use in a trial.

In a statement this afternoon, Jody Powell, White House press spokesman, said that President Carter had not been informed until today of the Justice Department plan to accept Mr. Helms's “nolo contendere” plea to misdemeanor charges, but that he had approved of it.

He said that the President believes “it is a just decision.”

It is one that “upholds the law but also serves the interests of national security,” Mr. Powell said.

Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, who was head of a committee that investigated abuses by the intelligence agencies, however, was critical of the arrangement.

“I thought there was to be an end to the double standard of justice for the big shots,” he said in a statement relayed by his press aide this afternoon. “Apparently Helms was too hot to handle.”

The issue, which has been under investigation for approximately two years, concerns testimony that Mr. Helms gave in 1973 concerning covert operations in Chile by the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Helms said, in response to questions, that his agency had not funneled money to opponents of the late Salvador Allende, who at the time was the Marxist President of Chile.
