What the fans don't realize is that the Yankees' gigantic payroll only assures that the Bombers will reach the postseason and not that they'll win the World Series, or even a playoff series. In the course of the regular season, the Boss opens his wallet and buys a replacement part here and there and the Yankees rumble into the postseason. But after that, anything can happen, and for the last two years anything has. In 2001, Arizona beat the Yankees with two amazing pitchers; last year, Anaheim battered the Yankees' starting pitching with a relentless attack. And if yesterday's game was any indication, the Twins are going to make the Yankees expend energy in this series. They challenged the arms of the Yankees' highly paid outfielders and made the Yankees look like the small-market team.

The play of the game, perhaps the series if Minnesota wins, was when Cristian Guzman singled in the third inning, then boldly took third base on a single to left, Guzman daring left fielder Hideki Matsui to throw him out. Matsui didn't. His throw was high and Aaron Boone missed the tag. Here was Guzman, a $2-million-a-year shortstop, challenging Matsui, the $6 million outfielder.

Alfonso Soriano threw a ball over Boone's head, allowing the Twins to score their third run. Bernie Williams allowed a ball to roll under his glove, Matsui let a ball get by him and Jason Giambi, the $13 million designated hitter, was 0 for 4. You wonder: what's up with this?

Pohlad had an explanation: his Twins had caught the Yankees counting their championships.

''What happens in cases like this,'' he said, ''is that sometimes teams like the Yankees will feel like they've already won, psychologically.''

The advantage for Minnesota in this postseason is that it is not feeling the pressure that teams like Boston and the Yankees are. The Red Sox have the ghost of seasons past breathing down their necks, the Yankees have Steinbrenner breathing down theirs.

And though you can't equate money with results, Steinbrenner does. He has huffed and puffed all season long about his $180 million team, whose payroll dwarfs every other. After yesterday's loss he was surely wondering: ''How can my $13 million power hitter be so lifeless? And how can my $12 million center fielder overrun a ball?''

As Pohlad left the Twins' clubhouse yesterday, he turned to Gardenhire and repeated his theory about the Yankees being overconfident. ''There you go,'' Gardenhire said in agreement. ''So we'll get after 'em, we'll keep going.''
