Meharry Medical College in Nashville, a historically black school, has started a $10 million, five-year study to learn why blacks are half as likely as other groups to wear seat belts, officials from the university and the Department of Transportation said. State Farm Insurance will pay for the study. The officials said the results should help improve campaigns promoting seat-belt use. ''You have to understand behavior before you can begin to change it,'' Dr. John E. Maupin Jr., president of the college, said.
