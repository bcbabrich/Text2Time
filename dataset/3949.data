The San Diego Chargers signed Miami Dolphins defensive end Marco Coleman to an offer sheet today, and in a stunning related move they released running back Natrone Means to help clear room under the salary cap.

Means rushed for a team-record 1,350 yards in 1994 and helped lead the Chargers to their first Super Bowl. But he held out of training camp last summer in a salary dispute, then missed most of the last half of the season with a groin injury.

General Manager Bobby Beathard wasn't immediately available for comment. The Chargers, who were pleased with the emergence of the rookies Aaron Hayden and Terrell Fletcher, apparently expected similar trouble negotiating with Means this year.

The Chargers also released wide receiver Shawn Jefferson and tight end Duane Young.

Coleman signed an offer for three years at $9.6 million, including a $4 million signing bonus. The Dolphins have seven days to match it.
