SATURDAY PUZZLE — It’s a RED LETTER day when we get a Brad Wilber/Doug Peterson puzzle. They are consistently well-filled, well-clued and really good at tripping me up.

Maybe you’ve had a similar experience. I had BANS instead of BARS at first, but corrected it when I got the crossing O’HARA. EAGLE Cam instead of PANDA Cam at 25 Across. BOOYAHS, HOOHAHS and HOOYAHS (not a word) until I got HOORAHS. I didn’t even come close to POOH POOH for “Discount” for the longest time, although I thought it was very clever when I got it. I don’t really think of WHOLE FOODS as a competitor to Trader Joe’s (hallowed be his name), because of the difference in price points.

But always look for the gimmes, and there will be at least a few, even on a Saturday. I dropped in LEONI for 34 Across’s “‘Madam Secretary’ star,” O’HARA for “‘Sir, you are no gentleman’ speaker,” RYAN for “Name on 2012 campaign posters,” ANISE for “Flavoring for springerle biscuits and cookies” (that was an EDUCATED guess; I already had the A), HOGWARTS for “Where Arithmancy is an elective” and more. Look at how much territory just those answers cover. From there, you can definitely branch out and solve a Saturday-level puzzle. It will just take longer than an early-week puzzle, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Let’s hear what Mr. Wilber and Mr. Peterson liked about their puzzle:

Constructors’s Notes:

Brad Wilber: Interesting that 17A worked out for us here. My brother and his family live in the Austin, Tex., area now, and so my first glimpse of any WHOLE FOODS was the giant “HQ store.” A grocery store that has its own parking garage tends to make this little country mouse hyperventilate. I have to travel quite a distance at home to get exotic items like fish sauce or Gruyere cheese or tomatillos. Doug Peterson: I’m a headbanger, so GUITAR SOLO and its clue are my favorites today. I also love the clue for HARE and wouldn’t mind at all if Deb posted a Bugs Bunny video on the blog. If you’re lucky enough to be at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament this weekend, please find Brad and me and say “hi.” For a modest fee, we’ll even give you hints for our puzzle.

That’s cheating! But HARE’s the very first wabbit video, when he was very much a prototype. The cartoon also has more gunshots per minute than most cartoons do nowadays, I would think.
