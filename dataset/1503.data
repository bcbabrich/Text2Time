It was an evening of jokes about Representative John Boehner’s tan, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s lack of restraint and the Fox News-MSNBC divide at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, a yearly convergence of policymakers, entertainers and the people who cover them. Nearly 3,000 people watched standup routines by Jay Leno, host of the “Tonight Show,” and President Obama on Saturday night at the Washington Hilton. (Videos from C-Span.)

Though most of the president’s jokes did not directly relate to policy, one biting quip conveyed the tensions behind the newly reignited immigration battle.

Mr. Obama noted Senator John McCain’s recent assertion that he had never identified himself as a “maverick.”

“We all know what happens in Arizona when you don’t have ID,” Mr. Obama said. “Adios, amigos.”

But most of the president’s jokes were gentler, often directed at himself. He joked about his drop in approval ratings, and in an apparent reference to the conspiracy theory that he was born in Kenya, he noted that his ratings were “still very high in the country of my birth.”

“The only person whose ratings fell more than mine last year is here tonight. Great to see you, Jay,” he said to Mr. Leno.

The 96-year-old event is one of the capital’s most glamorous, complete with a red carpet and exclusive galas. While the gathering honors journalistic achievements and raises money for the association’s scholarship fund, the boldface names in attendance tend to generate the most excitement. The likes of teen heartthrobs Justin Beiber and the Jonas Brothers mingled with Leon Panetta, the Central Intelligence Agency director. Kim Kardashian of reality show fame was in the room with Chris Matthews, a fixture of the original reality programming: the talking head panel. Twitter users characterized the event succinctly: “#nerdprom.”

Mr. Obama noted the presence of the Jonas Brothers, who can count Sasha and Malia Obama among their fans. But the First Father warned the band: “Two words: predator drones.”

“Speaking of tween heartthrobs, Scott Brown is here,” the president continued. He lauded the new Republican senator from Massachusetts, who posed in an advanced state of dishabille in Cosmopolitan when he was younger, as a “politician in Washington with nothing to hide.”

Sarah Palin was a favorite target for Mr. Leno. But he did have a kind note: If she ever wins the presidency, he said, “it would be the first time a beauty queen could actually bring about world peace.”

The dinner is seen by many as an opportunity for politicians and reporters to put aside daily antagonisms, but that can be awkward as well. After a searing critique of President Bush by Stephen Colbert in 2006, organizers have pursued entertainers with less edge.

“When you laugh, you indicate how you feel about something,” said the comedian Bill Maher, explaining to reporters gathered on the red carpet why Washington figures make for a difficult audience.

Levity can also be a risk during times of national crisis. Mr. Obama took a break from the humor toward the end of his set to be “mindful of the incredible struggles of those on the Gulf Coast” amid the oil spill, as well as of the “men and women in uniform who put their lives at risk every day for our safety and freedom.”

Mr. Obama continued his more serious tone in repeating an appeal he made to graduates of the University of Michigan during his commencement address earlier in the day, calling for people to broaden their sources of news, rather than filtering out outlets that don’t share their individual perspectives.

Michelle Obama helped present $132,000 in scholarships from the association to 18 students. The recipients of several journalism awards were honored: Ben Feller of The Associated Press and Jake Tapper of ABC News for deadline coverage, Mark Knoller of CBS news for sustained excellence and Suzanne Bohan and Sandy Kleffman of The Contra Costa Times for coverage of national or regional significance.
