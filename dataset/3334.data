Today alone, eight new fires were reported scattered throughout the region, and Ms. Barrett said overworked and exhausted firefighters would soon have to be rotated off duty for rest. She said officials would also have to be selective about where they put their stretched resources, trying to control fires of less than 10 acres as quickly as possible in what is known as ''initial attack'' to keep them from spreading, and, eventually, letting some isolated areas burn.

''As much as we worry about the fires, there's not a blade of grass or a tree out there that's important as the lives of our firefighters,'' Ms. Barrett said.

Except for a training accident in Alaska, there have been no firefighter fatalities in forest fires this year.

The fire in the Sequoia forest, a habitat for California spotted owls, is in an isolated area west of California Route 395. Eleven firefighters there have suffered injuries, all minor. Nine water-spraying helicopters and eight fixed-wing aircraft dumping flame-retardant chemicals are being used to supplement the efforts of firefighters on the ground, said Doug Johnston, an engineer with the Fire Department of neighboring Kern County, who was one of those called to the scene to help attack the blaze.

''The estimate now is that it won't be fully controlled for about two weeks,'' Mr. Johnston said, speaking by telephone from a regional command center in the town of Kernville. ''Our weather is going to change on us, with thunderstorms forecast. If we could get some precipitation, that would be good. But the history of this area is you just get lightning, with no rain.''
