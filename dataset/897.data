Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, is not running for re-election this fall, but he’s certainly kept busy this fall stumping for candidates in North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa. On Sunday, Mr. Paul will continue to promote his party, which many forecasters say will retake Congress, on several network shows, including CNN’s “State of the Union,” CBS’s “Face the Nation” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Most likely, Mr. Paul will also field a few questions about his own election plans, presidential election plans, that is.

The midterm elections are days away and Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, will make the cases for their parties on ABC’s “This Week.”

On “Fox News Sunday,” Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and 2012 Republican presidential candidate, will weigh in on the possible results of the midterm elections. Later on the show, Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, will push his party’s platform. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, will do the same on CBS.

Samantha Power, United States ambassador to the United Nations, will discuss the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where she recently visited, on CBS.

James Baker, former Secretary of State and chief-of-staff to President George Bush, will talk about what President Obama can accomplish in his final two years in office on CNN.

Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, will appear on Telemundo’s “Enfoque.”
