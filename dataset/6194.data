UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 2—If the boyish‐looking Arab were seen sipping his mint drink anywhere except in the Delegates’ Lounge here, he might hardly be noticed, yet he prominently helped gather support for the divisive draft resolution that would define Zionism as a form of racism.

He is Abdalla Yaccoub Bishara, chief delegate of Kuwait—which has a population of about one million—at the United Nations. He also belongs to the small group of movers and shakers, power brokers and king‐makers whose influence in the world organization by fear exceeds the relative importance of the countries they represent:

Their role is mainly behind the scenes rather than on the rostrum of the General Assembly hall; anyone who wants to grasp the inner workings of the United Nations must watch what they are doing.

The Kuwaiti representative, a handful of influential delegates from other parts of the world and a few high United Nations officials—some of whose names may mean little to the public—are players in an unending diplomatic poker game beside the East River.

How does one qualify for such backroom games, and how does one get the trump cards?
