The first track on ''Songs for the Deaf'' (Interscope), the third album by Queens of the Stone Age, consists entirely of a voice saying, ''Huh? What?'' and then 90 seconds of hums and clicks. The second track begins with someone tuning a radio, and a D.J. welcoming listeners to KLON: ''We play the songs that sound more like everyone else . . . than anyone else.'' There's a tinny drumbeat and a tinny guitar -- maybe the idea is to trick listeners into turning up the volume -- and then, finally, the whole band kicks in, playing a loud, fuzzy, exhilarating song called, ''You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, but I Feel Like a Millionaire.''

The guitarist Josh Homme has described his music as ''robot rock,'' in reference to his own metronomic style. But the vision he pursues is as flexible as the band's membership: on each album, Mr. Homme and the bassist Nick Oliveri are joined by a rotating cast of musicians; the guests on ''Songs for the Deaf'' include the former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, on leave from his current band, Foo Fighters. (Mr. Grohl is to perform with Queens of the Stone Age at Roseland in Manhattan on Thursday.)

Many of the songs find simple ways to avoid predictability. On ''God Is on the Radio,'' the band comes to a dead stop in the middle of every refrain. ''No One Knows'' is a battle between elegiac vocals and a chopped-up riff. And ''Song for the Dead'' grinds along, works itself into a frenzy and then collapses, exhausted.

The album isn't quite as impressive as its predecessor, ''Rated R.'' There are a few moments of monotony, and the band's digressive approach is occasionally exasperating. Most of the time, though, the band succeeds, charging (and sometimes lumbering) through a heavy, mysterious disc filled with in-jokes. Careful listeners are rewarded near the end, when a familiar guitar line jumps out of a spellbinding progressive-rock track: it's the same song the D.J. at KLON was listening to, almost an hour ago.
