SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — Holy moly, this one by Barry C. Silk took my breath away. I feel energized and beaten up at the same time, and as the “Top Gear” host Jeremy Clarkson once said, “the last time I had this much fun, furniture got broken.” This one got me RARIN’ TO GO.

Look at the insane long Downs that plunge through this puzzle: ZOOPLANKTON, F.D.R. MEMORIAL, BROWN SUGAR, PAPER TIGER, POP CULTURE!

Let your writing implement of choice wander through the white space and scrawl in some really fun entries, like ZEPPO (Marx,) OLD GEEZER, and DON’T MAKE ME LAUGH.

Blow your KAZOO for clues like “Things worth waiting for?” (TIPS) and “People pick pockets in it.”

And then sit back and wait patiently for a special Variety puzzle while we groove to the Rolling Stones:
