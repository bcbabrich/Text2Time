Barefoot runners have caught the attention of shoe giants and upstart companies, The New York Times reports, with many offering thin-sole designs that give the feel of barefoot running but with a layer of protection to protect the feet from scrapes, splinters and sharp rocks. Training methods like ChiRunning and the Pose Method as well as the best-selling book “Born to Run” also have fueled interest in the barefoot experience.

To shod runners, the idea of running without a shoe sounds impossible. But research has shown that barefoot runners use about 4 percent less oxygen than those wearing shoes. Barefoot runners appear to naturally compensate for the lack of cushioning and land more softly than runners in shoes. Running barefoot may improve running form and reduce injury risk because runners without shoes tend to land in the middle of the foot.

To learn more, read a summary of the data on barefoot training in this review in the journal Sports Science. A few years ago I wrote about barefoot running in this story, “Is Barefoot Better?” To learn more about thin-soled footwear that mimics the barefoot experience read The Times story, “Wiggling Their Toes at the Shoe Giants.”
