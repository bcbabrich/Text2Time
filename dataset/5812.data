A few weeks later she phoned to tell me that the Dramaten had mailed her a packet of photographs of its production. Would I like to see them? I said I would and, having in mind that she was elderly and walked with a cane, suggested that I stop by for them at her home in Patchin Place in Greenwich Village, since I often lunched in the neighborhood. She could even bridle on the phone: ''No, I prefer not to have visitors here. I'll bring them to your office tomorrow.'' The futility of disagreeing with her about matters small or large, especially if one was a publisher, was obvious. I respected Miss Barnes as an artist and admired her as a writer. We took pride in having her play on our list, and if we could possibly accommodate her wishes, we did so. I told her I looked forward to seeing the photos the next day.

Marianne Moore once told Elizabeth Bishop she had run into Djuna Barnes on the steps of the New York Public Library. ''I was curious,'' the younger poet wrote, ''and asked her what Djuna Barnes was 'like.' There was a long pause before Marianne said, thoughtfully, 'Well, she looked very smart, and her shoes were beautifully polished.' '' My own view of Miss Barnes was equally subjective and colored by what I had learned from Eliot, who had known her for decades. He greatly enjoyed her company. Whenever he was in New York, he took her to Charles, a French restaurant on the east side of Sixth Avenue, directly across from the old Jefferson Market and Patchin Place. He told me she had been ''disowned'' by her family because of her rather notorious life in Paris during the 1920's and 30's, as a member of the circle that gravitated around the wealthy American expatriate Natalie Barney. (This group of artists, writers and actresses, many of whom were homosexual, was vividly depicted by Colette in her book ''The Pure and the Impure.'') Occasionally I saw Miss Barnes walking in the neighborhood of our office at Union Square. She held her tall and thin frame as straight as a ramrod, using a silver-headed ebony walking stick and favoring her left side. Her most striking feature in her younger years had been a fine head of glossy auburn hair, which began to turn gray, thin out and frizzle in the 1960's. She was always smartly groomed and often wore black suits with a brightly colored or polka-dot scarf at her throat.

The limited earnings from her books - including her best-known work, the novel ''Nightwood,'' which Eliot had published in London in 1936 - were insufficient to sustain her. She depended on the generosity of patrons, and her chief supporter during the 50's and 60's was Peggy Guggenheim, a cousin of the publisher Roger Straus. I learned from Eliot the surprising fact that her four brothers were well-to-do, and I seem to recall that at least one was a banker. Her unconventional father, Wald Barnes, was born Henry Budington. He was 14 years old in 1870, when his mother, Zadel Barnes Budington, an early feminist, divorced her husband - an unusual event then - and went back to her own name, which the son then adopted.

Young Wald Barnes married Elizabeth Chappell of Oakham, England, and they gave exotic names to their five children - Thurn, Djuna, Zandon, Saxon and Shangar. Djuna, the second child and only daughter, was born in 1892 and grew up in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., in a house her father built on the Storm King mountain estate owned by their uncle, Justin Budington. Wald Barnes refused to send his children to school. According to her account, Djuna Barnes was ''educated at home, and received some of her first paychecks from New York newspapers,'' including The Morning Telegraph and The World. In 1915 her first book, ''The Book of Repulsive Women,'' was brought out as a chapbook by Guido Bruno of Greenwich Village fame. The Provincetown Players produced three of her plays in 1919; four years later Boni & Liverwright published her collection of stories, plays and verses, ''A Book.'' Horace Liverwright issued her novel ''Ryder'' in 1928 and her book of short stories, ''A Night Among the Horses,'' the following year. Her ''Ladies Almanack'' was privately published also in 1928. With the appearance of ''Nightwood,'' she achieved an international reputation. And after a gap of 22 years, she published her play. ''T HE ANTIPHON'' is impossible to understand without knowing the family background that inspired it. Its odd and sometimes archaic language adds to the difficulty: Dag Hammarskjold confessed to Miss Barnes that when he first read it, he was frequently baffled but, ''having worked with 'The Antiphon,' I now share your view tat there is nothing obscure in it.'' The play centers on a mortal combat between an aged and widowed mother, Augusta, and her daughter, Miranda, ''a tall woman in her late fifties'' who has ''a distinguished but failing air.'' Their duel, the author says, ''should be waged with style.'' The play ends with their deaths, the mother killing her daughter with a large brass bell, falling dead herself from the effort.

It is as fantastic a play as the stage set Djuna Barnes prescribes for it, with a balustrade on which hang ''flags, gonfalons, bonnets, ribbons and all manner of stage costumes. . . . A long table with a single settle facing front, at either end of which is set the half of a gryphon, once a car in a roundabout.'' All this is ''surrounded by music stands, horns, fiddles, guncases, bandboxes, masks, toys and broken statues, man and beast.'' This unlikely setting, to which members of the family have journeyed from the four corners of the earth for a reunion, serves as a kind of baroque courtroom in which we are the spectators while the whole family is put on trial. Miranda, the outcast daughter, is both prosecutor and defendant. At one point she makes an accusation against her mother for some obscure act that jolts the reader who grasps that she is describing her own birth: ''The salt spilled, the bread broke. Unmuzzled bone / Drew on the hood of flesh, entombing laughter: / Tongues came forth, and forth the hissing milk / Its lashing noose, and snared the gaping mouth. / A door slammed on Eden, and the Second Gate, / And I walked down your leg.'' A play of brilliant recrimination, ''The Antiphon'' is a version of the author's family history from her view, a dramatic parallel to another American playwright's long day's journey into night. W HEN Miss Barnes came and spread the photos of the Dramaten production on my desk, she also brought along a rave review by the drama critic of the Stockholm newspaper Espressen. I had never seen her look so happy. ''I owe Dag Hammarskjold everything,'' she said. ''If it hadn't been for translation, none of this would have happened.'' That there were no plans for a New York or London production she attributed, quite unfairly, to the disastrous tryout - in fact, it was a reading without sets or costumes - that Eliot had arranged for the Poets' Theater Company to put on for her at Harvard University in 1956, before ''The Antiphon'' was even published. In addition to Eliot, his friends I. A. Richards, Edwin Muir and Robert Lowell were in the audience. Everything about the Harvard tryout displeased her - the actress playing Miranda was not thin enough, all the performers mouthed difficult lines whose meanings had not been sufficiently clarified for them. Since this was merely a reading, they interrupted themselves from time to time, reasonably enough, to ask Miss Barnes what certain lines and words meant. This had enraged her. In her view, no poet should be subjected to such questioning, especially in public. To her the tryout was a wounding breach of good manners.
