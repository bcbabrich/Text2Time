Many of these bands play for audiences that range from college students through 60-year-olds. Some play a lot of 40th and 50th birthday parties. These local performers, who range in age from late 30's through 50's, take their music seriously -- or at least as seriously as you can when your band's name is Housewives on Prozac or you're singing Jackson 5 hits. But they are also adults with ''real'' lives complete with spouses, mortgages and children who need to be driven to baseball games and helped with their homework.

''From 3 to 7 p.m., I'm with my kids, taking care of homework, haircuts and doctor's appointments,'' said Mark Jacoby, who is known as Mark the Music Man and is especially popular in his home village of Irvington as a children's music specialist, entertaining at nursery schools, birthday parties, and other such events. What some residents may not know is that at night, Mr. Jacoby, 42, plays in one of two bands, the Blue Roadhouse Orchestra, which plays classic rock, including music by the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, and AM Gold, a modern pop band.

Mr. Jacoby said he and his wife had worked out a tag-team system that enables them to take care of their sons, ages 12 and 13. ''When my wife walks in the door after work,'' he said, ''I say, 'Benny has to read two chapters for tomorrow, a long-term project is due, they haven't eaten dinner yet, and I'm going to a rehearsal.' ''

Why do these aging rockers do it? Not for the money. Most working Westchester bands are doing well if they make $200 to $500 for a long night of playing. And being in a band involves more than rehearsing and performing.

Besides buying and maintaining instruments and recording equipment, there is the business side: calling club owners, distributing CD's and more.

''I spend a lot of time sending out e-mails, poring over Billboard top-100 lists and hunting for clothes,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''If I had a nickel for every minute I spend on eBay looking for bell-bottoms . . .''

THE reward, said the musicians, is not the money. They perform and make music to feel good about themselves. ''My band is my passion,'' said Joy Rose, 45, a mother of four from Hastings-on-Hudson who is the founder and lead vocalist of Housewives on Prozac, a successful female rock band.
