Now the cracks are starting to show on wide receiver Mike Sherrard. Sherrard said today he was angry and that he is being left out of the offense.

He wanted to make it clear that while he is upset about what he sees as his diminishing role in favor of the rookie first-round draft pick Thomas Lewis, he is more upset about the team's losing. He's a team player. But Sherrard says he has all disappeared from the offense, and in recent weeks has not been in the game on at least half of the third-down situations.

"I'm not happy about several situations," said Sherrard. "I'm not happy first because we're losing. I'm also not happy because I'm being taken out of the offense and I haven't been told why.

"The coaches did tell me earlier in the week that Thomas was going to get more snaps and I asked why and they said, 'We want to get him more time.' I'm thinking, 'At my expense? Am I the one who is causing the losing?' It's strange. If they want to get Thomas the ball more I can understand, but why at my expense?"

Sherrard has told teammates that he would be shocked if the Giants asked him back next season.

He would not comment on this, but it does seem to make sense. Sherrard is earning $1.3 million this season and is scheduled to earn $1.2 million next year. In the era of the salary cap, are the Giants going to pay that kind of money to a player who says he is being phased out? Not to mention that the coaching staff loves Lewis, a speedy player who can also return kicks.
