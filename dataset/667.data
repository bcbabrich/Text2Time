Q.

Tell me about the photo you chose as your turning point.

A.

I took this image the night after it was announced that George Zimmerman was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin trial two years ago. There were protests in the South Central neighborhood in Los Angeles, so two friends and I drove down from Ventura, Calif., to photograph them.

Q.

How was this photo made?

A.

There were 200 or so people in the streets, most of them residents of South Central. This was definitely not the same crowd that was protesting during the daytime in downtown Los Angeles at City Hall. This was a group of people that were upset and that dealt with the police on a pretty regular basis. Coming from Middlebury, Vt., and then living in Iowa, I’d never seen that many people in the street and never seen that many people upset and protesting. We marched with this group for a mile or two. Throughout the evening I had seen this gentleman walking around with a bat. I don’t know if he still had the bat at this point, but as the police got into formation some of the protesters went forward toward the police and some of them retreated. In that moment I rushed in, saw this gentleman protesting, got close to him and took the picture.

Q.

Why was this a turning point for you?

A.

It was a turning point for me because I got close to him, I started taking myself seriously as a journalist, and it wasn’t just for a school assignment. I was with the crowd and I was watching as everything was happening. I felt compelled to be there, that I needed to be there and tell their stories. It was the first time I could tell that what I was shooting was different from what everyone else was shooting and that I had my own unique way of seeing things. It put this hook into me about photojournalism, about getting closer to people, about not being afraid to take chances. This image really started everything for me.

Q.

What did you learn from this experience?

A.

This photo and this experience taught me to get closer to people, to talk to people and to show them that you actually care. The man in the photo didn’t want to even give me his name, but because I kept coming and kept showing up, and showed that I wasn’t just there to take a cool photo and leave, he eventually gave me his name. I showed that I was interested in the people who were participating in these protests. That message has stuck with me: Don’t just be a tourist. Show that you care by showing up, talking and listening to people, and that carries across in everything that I do. Whether I’m shooting a prom or anything else, you’re always going to make better images when people believe that you care about their story, and I try to care as much as I can.

Q.

How has photography itself influenced you as a person?

A.

Photography has made all the difference. I’ve always been a person who’s been interested in everything, interested in everyone, even at a very young age. As I got older, I couldn’t decide what I wanted to be, but I started picking up a camera and using it as a way to communicate with people and explore things that interest me.

It’s taken me places I would have never imagined going, and I have met so many wonderful people that I would not have met without photography. I get to wake up every day and if I’m really mad or sad, or any negative emotion, I love that photography gives me the option to find something so beautiful every day. It’s like I’m forced to find something beautiful and even if I’m photographing a sad situation, I’m trying to find the light in it.
