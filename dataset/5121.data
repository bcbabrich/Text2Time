Mike Krukow, a Giants starter, underwent arthroscopic surgery yesterday that disclosed a torn rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder. The 37-year-old right-hander, is expected to miss at least the rest of this season.

''It doesn't look good,'' Manager Roger Craig said. ''It's a lot worse than we thought.''

Krukow, who was originally thought to be suffering from bursitis, has spent parts of each of the last three seasons on the disabled list with shoulder injuries. Last year he pitched 124Z innings, the lowest total in his 11-year career.

This season Krukow had pitched only 43 innings in eight appearances, compiling a 4-3 record.(AP)
