The Bagger is so far back on the red-eye to Newark that he had to take a break on his way to the seat. It is more crowded than the People magazine party after the Screen Actors Guild awards, and although the Bagger can’t see first class from here, he’s pretty sure Philip Seymour Hoffman is not in the room. The Bagger is typing through turbulence over Kansas and trying to forget the trauma of watching “Flight 93” on the A&E channel. It didn’t scare him; it made him feel dirty for watching the whole thing. Now let’s roll:

Call the Bagger a geek, a newbie, a rube without portfolio, but he thoroughly enjoyed the Oscar announcements Tuesday morning. After several days of awards events where the signal-to-noise ratio was so high on the noise side it left much beyond the Bagger’s ken, the nominations were a clarifying moment, comparatively speaking. The event had it all: media throng, glamour in the form of Mira Sorvino (sorry, Sid), tension, excitement and denouement. And it ended in providing a new data set that can be endlessly deconstructed. It was organized well – the Bagger was ushered into a clean, well-lighted place with ample opportunities for hydration and engorgement, the event went off almost on time, and then the Bagger was thrown clear. And now that the nominations have been announced, ending months of speculation, the real speculation can begin. The almost five weeks of idle time means that much mischief will unfurl. So let’s do our part.
