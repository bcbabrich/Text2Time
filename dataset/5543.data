The Yankees and the team's owner, George Steinbrenner, weren't commenting, but Jon F. Hanson, the chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, flatly denied yesterday that authority officials had made any overtures to the Yankees in an effort to lure the club from Yankee Stadium to a new baseball stadium planned for the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. The denial, a sharp break with the authority's policy of not commenting on speculation about negotiations with major league teams, came after Vincent Tese, the chairman of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, citing unnamed ''sources,'' said that authority officials had offered to buy out the club's lease on Yankee Stadium, which runs through 2002, and to guarantee the team a minimum attendance of 2.2 million a year if the club would move to the Meadowlands.
