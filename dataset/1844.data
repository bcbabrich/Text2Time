Updated, 3:23 p.m. | Neither rain, nor wind, nor gloom of Chambers Street — nor even the inevitability of April Fool’s Day references at the two microphones — could stay preservationists and developers from their appointed controversy Tuesday morning at a much-anticipated public hearing in Manhattan.

The prospect of holding forth on a gargantuan new expansion proposal for St. Vincent’s Hospital Manhattan had already attracted 90 people by the hearing’s 9:39 a.m. start in the Borough of Manhattan Community College at the aforementioned Chambers Street, No. 199 to be exact.

Hundreds were expected to testify by the end of the day.

It was unusual for the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to abandon its cozy 50-seat hearing room on the ninth floor of the Municipal Building for such a capacious 913-seat hall. But the commissioners were aware that community board meetings on the issue had attracted more than 500 vociferous residents, so populous that many never got to the microphone.

The commissioners’ odyssey was not, however, unprecedented: in January of last year, during the cut-and-thrust over the plan to build a 355-foot-high tower at 980 Madison Avenue, the landmarks commission commandeered a large courthouse room to hear the public. The tower proposal was rejected.

At issue Tuesday were two concerns that could hardly be more important to residents of Greenwich Village: the possibility that the streetscape could be blighted by two enormous new towers at the expense of nine demolished buildings in a designated historic district, versus the future viability of essential, top-level medical care in the neighborhood.

Administrators and architects for the hospital — which is outmoded and cramped, and emerged from a two-year bankruptcy only last July — immediately made the PowerPoint case for its development plan. St. Vincent’s would raze its modernistic O’Toole Building on Seventh Avenue between West 12th Street and West 13th Street (originally mocked as “the overbite building,” but now admired by many preservationists). In place, it would build a 21-story advanced teaching hospital.

Eight other landmarked hospital buildings across Seventh Avenue between West 11th Street and West 12th Street would be sold to the developer William C. Rudin. They would be razed and replaced by a 21-story condominium tower, low-rise town houses and a midsize apartment building. The only way the hospital could afford the new building is to sell its buildings and land, administrators said.

The first three hours of the hearing included a detailed presentation on the project from the hospital’s consultants and the developer’s architects that offered a thorough disquisition on the history of medicine as it related to St. Vincent’s, not to mention a Power Point malfunction..

The audience, which was continually recirculating but hovered at about 150, thinned at that point.

After the visual show, the audience testimony finally began just before 1 p.m. Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said in a statement read by an aide that demolishing eight buildings on the East Side of Seventh Avenue would be “too extensive” and quoted a local preservation group that said that demolishing the buildings would “wreak havoc on the character of the historic district.” (An earlier version of this article rendered part of her statement incorrectly; it has been amended here.)

Also in a statement, State Senator Thomas K. Duane said that “the proposed 265-foot residential tower is inappropriate for this area,” adding that both the residential and hospital towers “are too tall and bulky.”

Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, said that “to allow the destruction of nine historic buildings in the Greenwich Village Historic District would obviate the entire meaning of landmark protection,” setting a harmful precedent.

If veteran audience members had no small sense of deja-vu, it was because they remembered that Greenwich Village has beaten back scores of incursions through the years — notably the plan of Robert Moses to bulldoze an expressway through the neighborhood under the rubric of “slum clearance.”

But hospital supporters stepped up to the microphones as well. “St. Vincent’s must be allowed to unlock the value of its real estate,” said Patrick Gaspard, executive vice president of 1199/SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, which has some 1,800 workers in the hospital.

He added: “It is not a simple choice, but it is the only one available.Without it, there is a real chance that the hospital would have to shut down.”
