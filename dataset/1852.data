In testimony at times combative and bristling with anger, Joseph Guzman, the man wounded 19 times by gunshots that killed his friend, Sean Bell, told a packed courtroom on Tuesday about hearing his friend’s last words.

Mr. Guzman thought he was going to die, he said. “I thought it was over.” He had climbed on top of Mr. Bell in a frantic effort to escape from the bullets coming at him through the passenger door, and he was practically on top of Mr. Bell. He said, “‘I love you, son.’ He said, ‘I love you, too.’ Then he stopped moving. Stopped talking.”

Mr. Guzman was shot 16 times, but three of the bullets passed through him, causing 19 wounds, he said. He stood up and stripped off his necktie to show Justice Arthur J. Cooperman, who is hearing the case without a jury, two scars on his shoulder and chest from bullets. On direct examination, Mr. Guzman, a hulking presence on the witness stand in State Supreme Court in Queens, leaned into the microphone and calmly described almost every bullet.

He said Mr. Bell was pulling away from the curb on the morning of Nov. 25, 2006, when a van ran into them. Suddenly a man appeared before the car, he said. “Black man,” Mr. Guzman said. “Silver gun.” The man, who was Detective Gescard F. Isnora, one of the three detectives charged in the shooting, opened fire, he said.

“The first shot is like, winged — I’m looking at his eyes as he shot me — he’s continuing to shoot,” Mr. Guzman said. “This is not a robbery. They’re trying to kill us. This is not a robbery.”

He said he told Mr. Bell, “Do it,” meaning drive away. He said he saw no police shield on the man, and that the man made no commands or said anything. Mr. Guzman said he then began scrambling toward Mr. Bell’s window on the driver’s side while Mr. Bell drove the car backward and forward again, hitting a wall and the van a second time before coming to a stop.

“I’m not trying to get shot in the face, so naturally I’m trying to go across the car,” he said. “I’m trying to go out the driver side window, is what I’m trying to do. I was getting shots from the top of my back. Three shots in my buttocks, four shots in my right side. I got three shots in my ankle.” He said he is permanently injured.

“I’ve got a dropped foot and nerve damage,” he said, and he has a metal rod where one leg bone was shattered. “My intestines were shot. I have numerous holes in my intestines. I have four bullets in me now.”

On cross-examination by Anthony L. Ricco, who represents Detective Isnora, Mr. Guzman became hostile several times and drew enough cheers and laughter from the Bell family’s supporters in the courtroom that Justice Cooper twice had to demand silence.

Mr. Ricco asked Mr. Guzman at length about his convictions for robbery and reckless endangerment, and for selling drugs, and frustrated the witness by asking him to recount exactly where Detective Isnora was standing when he fired.

“You know what needs to happen?” Mr. Guzman said. “This needs to happen to your family.”

As for the argument outside the Club Kalua between Mr. Guzman and others and a stranger near a parked S.U.V., Mr. Guzman said he never said, “Get my gun,” contrary to police witnesses, including Detective Isnora’s testimony last year before a grand jury.

Mr. Guzman’s cross-examination will continue Tuesday afternoon.
