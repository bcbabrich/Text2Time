Merger mavens aren’t very optimistic about the future.

That’s the view found in a survey of 59 of the leading bankers, lawyers and other experts on mergers and acquisitions who are heading to New Orleans for Tulane University Law School’s annual Corporate Law Institute. The M.& A. conference is scheduled to begin on Thursday, and DealBook will be on the ground to give you an inside look.

According to the survey, which was conducted by the Brunswick Group, a corporate communications firm, 69 percent of respondents believe it will take up to five years to return to the level of M.&A. activity seen in 2007 — up sharply from the 42 percent who shared that view in 2008. Meanwhile, only 29 percent of respondents maintain there will be signs of recovery in a year to 18 months — down from 52 percent last year.

As to what’s holding back deals, 39 percent primarily blamed the tight credit markets, while 26 percent cite the slowing economy and another 26 cite a lack of confidence in chief executives.

When deals do get done, 79 percent believe that they will be domestic deals as opposed to cross-border or foreign deals. Meanwhile, 88 percent believe that the dealscape will become nastier as low valuations tied to the depressed market are likely to set off an upsurge in unsolicited or hostile deals.

The 21st annual Tulane M.&A. conference is expected to attract some of the biggest names in mergers and acquisitions. The key speakers at the event include Robert Kindler, the global head of M.&A. at Morgan Stanley; Leo E. Strine Jr., the vice chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and Timothy Ingrassia, head of M.&A. for the Americas at Goldman Sachs. DealBook’s Andrew Ross Sorkin will be appearing on a panel as well.
