President Reagan offered a wry measure of his confidence today as he visited his campaign workers and joked about snoozing at Cabinet meetings.

''Some of you here were up all night, I have found out, and working,'' Mr. Reagan told a gathering of workers at the Reagan-Bush headquarters north of the Capitol. ''I know the long hours that many of you have put in. And I can only tell you that, if I could manage it, I would schedule a Cabinet meeting so that we could all go over and take a nap together.''

His partisans laughed loudly and applauded his allusion to the report earlier this year that the President occasionally nodded off when presiding at particularly monotonous Cabinet meetings. Where once the White House was embarrassed at the nap disclosure, Mr. Reagan made light of it today, indicating he hardly thought he was in an electoral home stretch in which any single utterance could prove costly with the voters. President Honors Hispanics

His day's schedule said as much. Mr. Reagan engaged in only light campaigning in the Rose Garden as he presided over the unveiling of a new stamp honoring Hispanic Americans, the ethnic group that Reagan strategists have courted for the past three years. ''I've always been aware of the many contributions that Americans of Hispanic descent have made to our country,'' said Mr. Reagan.
