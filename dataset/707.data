“I found my peace when I decided to never kill again,” Eastman said.

And thus was the new Morgan explained, his new code for survival solidified when his most coldblooded murder literally came back to haunt him, giving his sensei a mortal nibble. As death descended, Eastman handed over his lucky rabbit foot, the one we saw in the Season 5 finale, and gave a final piece of advice that sent Morgan on the quest back to Rick and friends. “You could stay here, but you shouldn’t stay here,” he said. “Everything is about people; everything in this life that is worth a damn.”

And therein, as another sage storyteller once put it, lies the rub. Because not-killing in the name of preserving your own inner peace is great, for you and your adversary, but less so for the people who might encounter that adversary later. The Wolves Morgan declined to kill last season, including the one he lectured on Sunday, later took out others and eventually attacked the Alexandrians who were feeding and sheltering Morgan. At least one of the Wolves he turned loose in Episode 2 appeared to attack Rick last week.

Inner peace is great, but preserving it in such a way that jeopardizes the people who both sustain and depend on you is ultimately an act of selfishness. If you let me go, Morgan’s captive told him after his story, “I’m going to have to kill you, Morgan — I’m going to have to kill everyone,” children included. “Those are the rules,” he said. “That’s my code.” So chew on that, Morgan-san.

That’s the problem with codes: They work in isolation but get trickier when they bump up against one another. For all the objective nobility of Morgan’s decision about how to exist in the world, it doesn’t really answer the question about what he owes everyone else, and how best to satisfy those obligations. That’s a riddle that he and nearly everyone else on this show, whether it’s Rick’s ruling with an iron fist or Glenn’s encouraging others at his own peril, have yet to solve.

A Few Thoughts While We Put Our Feet Up

• Glenn Watch: No answers this week, not that I expected them. And not that I’m complaining, either. I’m not sure Sunday’s episode needed to be 90 minutes long. (Does any TV show need to be 90 minutes long, which seems to happen more and more these days?) But I do think, after the pace of the first three, we all could use a little break. (Update: Commenters and others point out that Steven Yeun was left out of the opening credits.)

• Enjoyed the flaming walker who emerged from Morgan’s fire in the early part of the episode. Seems like you could weaponize those things, right? Light them and direct them into a rival camp? I suppose it doesn’t show much regard for one’s opponent, but it would be fun to watch.
