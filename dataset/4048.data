''We never had a discussion about 'Let's change your image, George,' '' Mr. Rubinstein said. ''The discussion centered on, 'What's the best thing to do as I build a good team.' Last year George told me he wanted to build the best team he could for New York and for Yankee fans, and to let that do the talking for the team.

''He's aware of all the bad publicity, and this was his decision, to build the club and let people write about the club. It's been on purpose that he's given very, very few interviews. He came up with the solution, he stayed the course, and it was hard. During this whole year, he wasn't boastful, he wasn't hateful. It was an interesting effort on his part.''

Not everyone thinks that the Yankee owner has changed his stripes. ''Sports fans have the feeling that the Yankees win in spite of him,'' said Chris Russo, the co-host of ''Mike and the Mad Dog,'' a popular sports call-in radio show on WFAN-AM. ''Most realize he's a pain in the neck.'' But even Mr. Russo, who is emphatically not a Steinbrenner fan, acknowledges a seeming change in the volatile facade.

''Last year he really ticked people off,'' Mr. Russo said, ''so I'm not going to give him a break just because he's had a good 11 months.''

But not only do some fans feel he has a lot of making up to do, there's also a feeling that Mr. Steinbrenner is making nice to New Yorkers before announcing that he will move the team from the Bronx to Manhattan or even New Jersey.

''He just wants to get a nice reputation before he makes the big move,'' said Frank Myers, 19, who was outside Yankee Stadium yesterday afternoon. ''With a guy like him, it always comes down to money. If he moves the stadium to a richer neighborhood, he'll make more money.''

Mr. Steinbrenner, 66, broke his silence briefly yesterday and spoke to a reporter on the subject of his image. He said his demeanor this season had nothing at all to do with the issue of whether he will move the team. He declined to address the question of whether he would move. As for his treatment of Mr. Showalter, he said, ''I will not say one bad thing about Buck Showalter, but I don't think I have to apologize for what happened.''
