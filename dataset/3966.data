The editor of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, William F. Woo, is one of the country's most prominent journalists. But when it came to getting the news that he was being forced out of his job, Mr. Woo was among the last to know.

Mr. Woo was in Europe on vacation late last month when the paper's publisher, Nicholas G. Penniman 4th, told the newsroom staff that a new editor, yet unnamed, would be brought in. The decision capped the Pulitzer Publishing Company's efforts to revive a lagging flagship by imposing a more business-oriented leadership. In the process, the paper is losing its preeminence in a corporate family that includes nine thriving television stations in markets scattered from the Carolinas to the desert Southwest.

I came home to find the broadcast media reporting that I had been fired, my minister was on the phone saying he was praying for me, my children were asking, 'Daddy, are you being fired?' " said Mr. Woo, who is 60 and has been editor for 10 years. "So there was a certain amount of personal distress -- quite a bit, in point of fact -- associated with the circumstance with which this thing happened."

The changes not only left Mr. Woo, a nationally respected editor and columnist, shaking with anger but also plunged the paper into turmoil, as the editorial staff of about 270 people questions everything from its management to its politics.
