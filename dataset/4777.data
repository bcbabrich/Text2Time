In this land of high emotions, it would have seemed odd if there were no demonstration to mar the beginning of the talks. And Cedric Wilson, a Democratic Unionist and former Mayor of nearby Castlereagh, insured that this day was no different than any other in the last two decades of strife that have racked this province. "Ulster is British! That is the message for you. No surrender to Dublin rule!" he shouted at Mr. Hume, who was unruffled.

"We are very patient people," Mr. Hume told reporters. "It is a beginning and we hope it will be successful," he said of the talks. In an interview last week, he said he was "more hopeful than optimistic" that the talks would result in an agreement, making him one of Ulster's more upbeat politicians.

If the four parties make substantial progress toward agreeing on a form of regional government -- and Mr. Brooke will be the arbiter of "substantial progress" -- the Irish Government will join the talks. Disagreement Among Protestants

Besides the divisions between unionists and nationalists, there is also disagreement within the unionist ranks. James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, wants fuller political integration between Ulster and Britain and has opposed the idea of a regional assembly. The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, favors the latter. But there are also elements within their respective parties that disagree with them.

Members of the Social Democratic and Labor Party have mixed feelings about any regional government that could be dominated by the unionists.

How to insure that the unionists do not abuse their majority status and discriminate against Catholics as they did in the 50 years before direct rule by London was imposed in 1972 is a contentious issue.

Although some are more willing to compromise than others, Democratic Unionists and Ulster Unionists generally oppose setting up a power-sharing executive branch like one created by the so-called Sunningdale agreement of 1973. That guaranteed the Social Democratic and Labor Party a minimum number of seats on the executive irrespective of its electoral support. Even though the administration only had limited powers, it was brought down in May 1974 after only five months in office by protests and strikes by Protestants. Protecting Minority Rights
