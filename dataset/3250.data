If Vice President Al Gore has counted on anything in this tumultuous political season, it is that the strong economy will give him the upper hand in the general election should he win the Democratic presidential nomination.

The economy remains as strong as ever. But Mr. Gore's strategy for using it to his advantage would have to change -- and could in the end prove to be less potent -- if his Republican opponent turned out to be Senator John McCain rather than Gov. George W. Bush.

To Mr. Gore's team, Mr. Bush, who until a few weeks ago seemed to have a lock on his party's nomination, is in many ways the ideal rival. The centerpiece of the Texan's campaign has been his big tax cut, a proposal that Mr. Gore's advisers are certain they could label fiscally irresponsible, a threat to Social Security and a gamble with the current prosperity.

When it comes to economic issues, Mr. McCain presents a smaller, more elusive target. While he supports tax cuts, they are of a scale closer to those advocated by Mr. Gore. Like President Clinton and the vice president, Mr. McCain emphasizes that saving Social Security is his first goal. And like the administration, he promotes the long-term benefits of reducing the national debt.
