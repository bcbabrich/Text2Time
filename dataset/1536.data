FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — I liked this puzzle for a variety of reasons. First, it had a good-looking grid. Second, it was an interesting construction. Third, it had a slightly different vibe to it. Fourth, there were some clever and different clues.

The Details:

A construction like this, with its waffle pattern of eight 15-letter entries, can sometimes make for an easier solve. The higher number of 3-letter answers is a factor. But that’s a good thing in my book. I like a good-but-not-too-tough challenge on Friday, reserving the real pain for Saturday. I mean, banging one’s head against a wall is great, but one day a week is plenty.

My favorite clue was “Cook’s final setting.” I thought first of a temperature setting on an oven, then a place where a bake-off might be set, before finally arriving on HAWAIIAN ISLANDS, the setting where Captain Cook died in 1779 at the age of 50.

After getting ABE for “Phiz on a five,” I still had no idea what that clue meant. Turns out phiz is slang for a face, via the word physiognomy.

No, we’re not cranking “Ask Will” back up on a regular basis, but a question came up recently on the cruciverb.com “cruciverb-L” e-mail list, which I decided to put to Mr. Shortz:

ASK ? WILL

Q.

What rules do you have for using or not using question marks at the end of clues that involve wordplay?

A.

• The more twisty, iffy or nonliteral a clue is, the more likely it is to have a question mark.

• A borderline twisty clue may get a question mark early in the week and not get one later, even though the clue is worded exactly the same.

Sometimes, however, I have to admit I’m not consistent. Every so often Frank Longo will inform me, when he’s test-solving a Times puzzle: “You used [or didn’t use] a question mark the last three times you ran this same clue.” And unless I can articulate a good reason to be different this time, I go back to the way I’ve done it before.

In sum, when to use question marks in crossword clues is not a science. In borderline cases, often arguments can be made either way. Sometimes even Frank and I argue about whether or not a question mark is needed on a particular clue. There is no hard and fast rule.

A Final Thought: Here’s IVO Pogorelich getting a workout at the Chopin Piano Competition in 1980, one he was famous for not winning.
