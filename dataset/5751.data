To the Editor:

Abolition of the National Labor Relations Board does not require repeal of all the substantive provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.

Prof. William B. Gould 4th is surely correct in his judgment that workers and their unions would be worse off in a regime regulated only by the market and, perhaps, the criminal law .

But all players, including management, stockholders and consumers, may be better off if the regulatory system does not rely upon an ''independent'' administrative agency, presumably ''expert'' in matters of labor-management relations.

Like most administrative agencies, the labor board's first loyalty is to the board. The agency seeks to maximize its influence (and its budget) by ever-increasing regulatory intervention. The result is a mass of detailed rules lacking overall coherence. Parties are induced to engage in endless litigation to ''distinguish'' their case from all others.
