Dennis Martinez gained his first victory at Yankee Stadium 11 days before Joe Torre got his first victory anywhere as a manager. Last night, Torre made it 1,000 as the Yankees edged the Seattle Mariners, 3-2, and Martinez is still looking for No. 2 at Yankee Stadium.

''It doesn't seem that long ago, but it was 20 years,'' Torre said of his first victory, with the Mets. ''We beat Montreal at Shea Stadium. Craig Swan. It was the first game I managed.''

Torre joined Bobby Cox and Tony La Russa as the only 1,000-game winners among active managers, primarily because David Wells pitched his best game with the Yankees. Wells, admittedly growing weary of comparisons with Jimmy Key, scattered seven hits, walked none and struck out nine in seven and two-thirds innings. He was especially tough with runners on base.

''All I've been hearing for the last stinking week is we want Key back and all that,'' Wells said. ''People are going to say things. Let them say it and go on.''
