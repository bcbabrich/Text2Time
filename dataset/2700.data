Alan Nero, Hernandez's agent, said all of the offers he had received were for one year in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million. The last time he was a free agent, in 1999, Hernandez signed a contract with Milwaukee that paid him $10 million for three years, plus the $25,000 bonus he earned for making the 2002 National League All-Star team.

''What has happened,'' Nero said, ''is this market, from the players' point of view, is very depressed. Players have to decide whether they want to take massive paycuts or wait their turn. In Jose's case, he feels he's coming off a career year, and he doesn't feel he should have to take a paycut.''

The Mets, San Francisco, Colorado and Cincinnati are the teams that have pursued Hernandez, 33.

Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, will not discuss negotiations with a particular player, but it is clear he wants to put together the left side of his infield as cheaply as possible. He signed Rey Sanchez -- for a $1.3 million salary and the chance to earn $700,000 in bonuses based on playing time -- to keep shortstop warm for Jos√© Reyes. He would like to get Hernandez for a similar total.

The Mets had Bill Mueller on their list of prospective third basemen, but he lost interest in them when Phillips would offer no more than one year. A report circulated among general managers and agents yesterday that Mueller had agreed to a two-year, $4.5 million contract with Boston, but Mueller's agent, Dave Meier, said they had no deal. ''We're talking to them, but we're not there yet,'' he said.

Dan O'Dowd, the Rockies' general manager, acknowledged that he had been talking with Nero about Hernandez. Asked about the low, similar offers Hernandez received, O'Dowd said: ''I can only speak for ourselves. We just don't have a whole lot of money to work with.''
