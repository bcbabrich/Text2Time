As someone who served in the Air Force in World War II, and again in the Korean conflict, I would comment:

The military is an artificial society with its own traditions, requirements and purposes. Asking the military to catch up to modern society in terms of its gestalt is absurd

There is no right to serve. In fact, the military refuses to accept many otherwise qualified people for reasons that may seem slight until they are subjected to combat stress -- flat feet, colorblindness, wrong height, wrong weight, asthma attack after age 12.

Let us focus on AIDS. The military draws over four-fifths of its blood supply from its own people. Dog tags carry each serviceman's/woman's blood type to facilitate transfusions in emergency and combat situtions.

I would refuse to accept a transfusion from a blood supply to which homosexuals had contributed. If I were in an emergency situation and there was no donor but a known homosexual available, I'd bleed a long time waiting for someone I could trust.
