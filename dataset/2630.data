United Airlines, which is trying to develop a restructuring plan to leave bankruptcy protection, said yesterday that it had identified $625 million in additional annual savings. The executive vice president, Peter D. McDonald, said the biggest savings, $200 million a year, would come from the maintenance department. United also wants to save $150 million a year on airport operations. Other savings will come from fuel, distribution, reservation centers and at the United Express regional carrier. United has said it will probably terminate its four employee pension plans and replace them with less-generous programs. United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, has warned employees to expect other cuts. Micheline Maynard (NYT)
