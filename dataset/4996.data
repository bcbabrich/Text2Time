The trip is a homecoming for a musician who has built a jazz style on his South African heritage; the name of his group, Ekaya, means ''home.'' In Mr. Ibrahim's music, the rolling rhythms of Cape Town's township jazz meet gospel chorales and shouts, Ellingtonian harmonies and spiky modernist passages, bound together by an overarching warmth and dignity. ''In some ways, in the music, we never left South Africa,'' he said. ''I know where my roots are, and they stay with me.''

But to make his music, Mr. Ibrahim left South Africa. He was named Adolphe Brand when he was born in 1934 in Cape Town, a city he calls ''the most beautiful place in the world.'' As he studied piano, he soaked up gospel - his grandmother was the pianist at the local African Methodist Episcopal church - and jazz; he was nicknamed ''Dollar'' because he bought albums from visiting American sailors. Growing up, he lived in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg, and in 1959 he formed the Jazz Epistles, which also included Mr. Masekela and which became a leading South African jazz band.

'A Decision You Had to Make'

By the early 1960's, ''the noose tightened on a social level,'' he said. ''The social and political atmosphere was really becoming oppressive. There was no place to play, and musicians were not considered professionals.''

''There was a decision you had to make in South Africa as a creative artist,'' he continued. ''Either you toed the line and worked under those conditions, which was almost completely impossible, or you stopped playing, or you left. The bulk of the culture left, and we were among the last people to go. It was like being in a vacuum. And we had come to a period in our lives when we needed to be with others working in the same direction as we were.''

Mr. Ibrahim and Ms. Benjamin settled in Switzerland, and Duke Ellington, who was touring, heard the pianist's trio in a club in Zurich. Ellington brought the group to Reprise Records - its first album was called ''Duke Ellington Presents the Dollar Brand Trio'' - and to the 1965 Newport Jazz Festival. Ms. Benjamin sang with Ellington's band; later, Mr. Brand substituted for Ellington as pianist for five nights with the Ellington orchestra.

Mr. Ibrahim, who changed his name after converting to Islam in the late 1960's, and Ms. Benjamin traveled in the United States, Europe and Africa through the late 1970's. Their first son, Tsakwe, was born in Swaziland, where Mr. Ibrahim tried unsuccessfully to start a music center; their son Sidi was born in Cape Town in 1974.
