More Americanization

Sometimes it seems that French comedies never die. They're simply exported to the United States for recycling. ''The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe'' becomes ''The Man With One Red Shoe.'' ''A Pain in the A-'' becomes ''Buddy Buddy.'' ''Three Men and a Cradle'' becomes ''Three Men and a Baby.''

Need further proof? Pay a visit to Tacoma, Wash., where the French director Francis Veber, who has had three of his comedies - including the first two above - made into American movies, has been putting the finishing touches on ''Fugitives,'' starring Nick Nolte, Martin Short and James Earl Jones. The film, made for Disney, is the American version of Mr. Veber's ''Fugitifs'' (1986), with Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard.

Or try Vancouver, British Columbia, where the American director Joel Schumacher (''St. Elmo's Fire,'' ''The Lost Boys'') has been at work since the end of May filming ''Cousins,'' for Paramount. The film - starring Ted Danson, Isabella Rossellini, Sean Young, William Petersen, Norma Aleandro and Lloyd Bridges - is the American version of the popular 1975 French film ''Cousin, Cousine,'' directed by Jean-Charles Tacchella and starring Marie-Christine Barrault, Victor Lanoux, Marie-France Pisier, Guy Marchand, Ginette Garcia and Sybil Maas.

''I discovered it's very difficult to remake a movie,'' Mr. Veber said. ''It is far more difficult than to make an original film, because in an original film you have an impression of inspiration. You create something. When you remake a movie, you are - in spite of yourself - in reference to the other movie, even if things are changed a lot, which is the case in this one.''
