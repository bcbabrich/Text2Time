Stanley E. Michels, a lawyer and politician from Washington Heights who served on the City Council from 1978 to 2001 and was active on environmental issues, particularly water quality, and tenants’ rights, died this morning. He was 75.



The cause was angiosarcoma, a cancer of the circulatory system, his family said. A full obituary of Mr. Michels is in the Saturday print edition of The Times.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ordered municipal flags to be flown at half-staff from today through Sunday, when Mr. Michels’s funeral service is scheduled. The service will begin at 10:30 a.m. at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, on Amsterdam Avenue at West 76th Street
