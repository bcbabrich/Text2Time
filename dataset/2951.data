To the Editor:

The effect of permitting American novelists to compete for Britain's most coveted literary award (''Booker Prize Is Tempest-Tossed,'' news article, May 25) may perhaps be suggested by the record of the Irish Times International Fiction Prize, open to all books written in English and published in Ireland, Britain or the United States.

Since the prize's inception in 1989, five of the nine winning writers have been Americans (Don DeLillo, Louis Begley, Norman Rush, Annie Proulx and Lorrie Moore) and one a Canadian born in Sri Lanka (Michael Ondaatje). The other three are British (A. S. Byatt), South African (J. M. Coetzee) and Irish (Seamus Deane). The three-person international jury has never included more than one writer from the United States.
