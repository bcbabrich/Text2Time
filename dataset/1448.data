PASADENA, Calif. — It has been a trying season for Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor.

But throughout the ups and downs, he’s been able to turn to the Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James for advice. James started talking with Pryor last year to try to help him cope with his youthful fame.

The two have not spoken recently, but Pryor said that James had preached to him about the importance of taking advantage of opportunities like his eighth-ranked team’s game Friday against No. 7 Oregon in the 96th Rose Bowl.

“Every game is a stage,” Pryor said. “This is a big stage. We have to perform better on big stages.”
