Pat Dye, the Auburn coach, was fit to be tied again. In a home-stadium battle on Saturday night with Tennessee, their foremost Southeastern Conference rival, Dye's Tigers came from a 26-9 deficit to trail, 26-25.

Auburn had scored on a 13-yard, fourth-down pass, Stan White to Greg Taylor with 1 minute 56 seconds remaining. For the ensuing conversion play the choice was to try for 2 points and victory, or place-kick for 1 and a deadlock.

Dye chose the tie and got it, as he had on the last play of the 1988 Sugar Bowl when Auburn tied Syracuse, 16-16. After that fans of the Orangemen sent the coach dozens of neckties and derisive challenges to his courage.

After this latest tie, the Auburn coach predictably said that his team had played too hard to come away with a loss; that a defeat might have knocked the Tigers out of the run for the conference championship, which Auburn has won or tied for the last three seasons, and he did not want to take that chance away from his team.
