Warnings by the Reagan Administration that it would oppose further World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank loans if Chile's leaders did not improve their human rights record, appear to have shaken the ruling junta a bit. According to the Center for International Policy, Chile asked that final consideration of some $250 million in multilateral development bank loans be postponed until November.

They had originally been scheduled for consideration in September or October.

Recently, Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams warned that, if Chile did not move toward a democracy, the Administration would oppose any of the new loans. Chile's President, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, in turn, threatened to stop payment on all of Chile's $20 billion in foreign debt, the highest per capita in South America.

But that could just be necessary grandstanding. Future financing that might total $1.5 billion from private banks appears to hinge on Chile's good standing with the World Bank and the development bank. As such, although the loan was in the final stages of approval, ''Chile claimed that it needed additional time to get its economic plans in order before presenting the loan to the World Bank executive board,'' the international policy center said.
