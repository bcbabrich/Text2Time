An article on Friday about retail coffin sales in Brooklyn misstated the position of the National Funeral Directors Association. The group is lobbying the Federal Trade Commission to include retailers under Federal regulations that require the disclosure of funeral prices and services, not to require licensing of retailers as funeral home directors. The article also misidentified the association's headquarters city; it is Milwaukee, not Washington.
