''I made a complete model of the Palais Royal before deciding what would work,'' said Ms. Pepper, 77, an American who lives between New York and Todi, Italy. ''This is an extraordinary challenge because my work is vertical and high and the trees are vertical. Putting something vertical next to the vertical is very complicated. Because the space is long and narrow, I opted to turn it into an installation, with a series of portals, to create an experience as you go along.''

Ms. Pepper's large abstract sculptures in iron and steel, some of which evoke Brancusi, others Giacometti, were most recently exhibited in the spacious gardens of Fort Belvedere in Florence. Perhaps surprisingly, they look equally at home here. The space imposes symmetry, and Ms. Pepper has not tried to fight it. Her first piece, ''Cleopatra's Wedge,'' 18 feet high and weighing 4,000 pounds, sets the tone, its broad face presiding atop a wooden plinth, like a sentinel -- one of her favorite words for her work -- over the entire installation.

It leads to an assortment of columns, at times reminscent of ornate medieval lances, as well as to what she calls ''urban altars'' through which people can walk. In the middle a circle of five smaller sculptures called ''Moline Markers,'' which she describes as ''metamorphosized tools,'' provide a moment of relief from the monumentalism. ''I don't try to get into meaning,'' she said. ''I'm interested in memory, continuity, a sense of the past. I believe in the permanence of beings and things.''

Ms. Abakanowicz, 69, who currently has an installation of five large sculptures on the Roof Garden at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents her works on a more human scale, with the exception of ''Cor-ten Armor,'' two geometrical forms that resemble stylized dinosaur heads. Versions of some of the sculptures here are also present in New York, among them ''Figure on Beam,'' ''Birds'' and ''Bambini,'' which shows 100 (in New York there are 40) small headless figures. All but ''Bronze Crowds'' (1991), comprising 35 larger headless figures, have been done in the last year.

''When I was invited to show here a year ago, I was empty, I had nothing,'' she said. ''So this was a stimulus for me to make things. I had always wanted to do 'Birds.' I had a real need to do 'Birds.' I think they fit into the rhythms of this garden, with the lace of the trees.''
