This city is as dominated by one-party rule as any in the country. The registered Democrats in the nation's capital outnumber Republicans by more than 11 to 1, and even independents dwarf Republicans by nearly 2 to 1.

That has kept Republicans out of most significant elected offices since local residents were given the right to elect their own leaders more than 20 years ago under a plan known as Home Rule. But as the city tries to climb out of a financial crisis that led to the creation of a financial control board in the spring, it has been a Republican, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has played a leading role in resolving the city's management and fiscal problems.

Acting as a buffer between House Republicans with ambitious ideas for reshaping local government and city officials who want to protect the limited autonomy they have, Mr. Gingrich has shepherded the factions along a path lined with political thorns.

House Republicans, many of them acolytes of Mr. Gingrich, are eager to flex their muscles of fiscal conservatism by reversing years of overspending and questionable management practices. They have proposed such bedrock Republican notions as eliminating all financing for abortions as a condition of the city's winning its 1996 appropriation from Congress, a $660 million subsidy for taxes that are not paid by Government agencies, foreign embassies and not-for-profit institutions.
