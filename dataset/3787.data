Louis Auslander, distinguished professor of mathematics and computer science at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died Tuesday at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 68 and lived in nearby Pelham Manor.

The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, the university said.

Dr. Auslander was equally at home in the divergent branches of pure and applied mathematics, as evidenced in his voluminous output of books and research papers. He had been on the CUNY faculty since 1971, when he joined the sprawling institution's elite group of teachers recognized as distinguished professors.

A native of Brooklyn, he graduated from Columbia College in 1949 and then earned an M.A. at Columbia. He received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1954, shortly after starting his teaching career as an instructor at Yale University.

He advanced through the academic ranks at the University of Pennsylvania and Indiana University, was appointed a full professor at Purdue University in 1962 and taught at the Belfer Graduate School of Science, Yeshiva University, before joining the CUNY faculty.
