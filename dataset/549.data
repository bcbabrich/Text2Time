In the still, quiet space, with the afternoon light coming in from Harrison Street, I could tell he was measuring my words. Finally, he reached a verdict. “I don’t think you want to be my assistant. But you might want to be a playwright.”

The thought had never occurred to me.

I began writing plays.

Years later, I found out that Albee, whose early goal was to be a poet, had shown his poems to Thornton Wilder. Wilder apparently read each carefully, then suggested Albee write plays instead. Now, my playwriting career was not what Albee’s was to Wilder’s, but Albee had somehow seen something in me that I had not yet seen in myself. This was another gift from Albee. Who soon became “Edward.”

He helped me get a fellowship to his foundation in Montauk, where writers and visual artists spend the summer in Spartan rooms carved out of an old barn. He would come by every morning with the mail, and to chat. He wanted to know what we were reading. He approved of my deep dive into Franz Xaver Kroetz. He made a face when I mentioned Barbara Pym. He was, I came to realize, trying to cultivate taste.

He spoke with contempt about Hollywood and the writers who went there. TV had yet to begin its renaissance, and Hollywood was a place where writers slouched in disgrace. I held my tongue. I never revealed my admiration for Mike Nichols’s work on “Virginia Woolf,” especially knowing how Edward had frowned on the film’s “hopeful” ending, its “sentimental” score.

I never mentioned I wished more of his plays had been made into movies in that jaggedy, in-your-face Cassavetes style. That there was something exhilarating about being trapped with those monsters, and their words, in those fat, messy close-ups. Each word of dialogue measured for its vitality, its maximum punch. For its ability to do damage. To wake people up to themselves.

As I write this from Los Angeles, where I now write for television, I often think of those words, his awareness of their currency and energy, their ultimate economy. This is precisely what’s needed on the small screen. It’s also what Edward Albee began encouraging in me from our first meeting.
