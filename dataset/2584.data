The diaries are an English equivalent of Spalding Gray's monologues, a stream of highly personalized, mordant conversations with himself. In ''The Smoking Diaries'' he writes about the plight of playwrights: they ''work in solitude, then expose the work of their solitude in an indecently public manner.'' He says he likes the first part, not the second. In a wry aside he writes that he regards himself as ''a negative reverse alchemist, in that I take the dross of my life and turn it into something drossier.'' At the core of the book are his obsessions. Drinking four bottles of Champagne a day, he became an acute alcoholic. About eight years ago, as he took one last sip of Champagne, he felt his life draining away, and he fell into a coma. After weeks in delirium in a hospital, he gave up drinking.

Smoking was another matter. He has been ''a heavy smoker'' since he was 7, and when it was suggested that that is an extraordinarily early age, he said, ''I think in Cambodia children start smoking at 3 or 4.'' His parents were also a lifelong smokers. On her deathbed his mother finally vowed not to have another cigarette.

When Mr. Gray had a bout with prostate cancer, he went to a urologist who smoked. ''My sort of urologist,'' he said.

After his friend Ian Hamilton, the biographer, died, and Mr. Pinter was found to have esophageal cancer (after surgery, he recovered), Mr. Gray began writing another diary to keep his mind off these personal tragedies, not intending it for publication. Part of it was printed in Granta, leading to the book.

In a profession in which the writer is at the whim of producers and critics, he is a true survivor, undiminished in his enthusiasm for theater even as he wonders why his plays are not performed more often.

Two fairly recent ones, ''Simply Disconnected'' (a sequel to ''Otherwise Engaged'') and ''The Late Middle Classes'' (a poignant memory play inspired by his childhood), have never been staged in London. And ''Butley,'' for one, is still so identified with Bates, who died in December, that it is not often revived. Nathan Lane, however, did it last year at the Huntington Theater in Boston, and there are plans to bring it to Broadway next season.

What could improve London theater? Without pause, Mr. Gray said, ''It's capitalism, profit and loss, and there's not much you can say about that.'' On the other hand there is ''the subsidized theater, which has altered the equation,'' except in his own case. He has had trouble connecting with Britain's major theaters. ''If only I'd had a gift for basic diplomacy,'' he says in his book, he might ''at least have got my plays returned more speedily by Trevor Nunn,'' then director of the National Theater.
