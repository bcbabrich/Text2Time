Following are excerpts from remarks by Senators Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, in the Senate debate yesterday on the nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general, as recorded by The New York Times:

Senator Smith

I consider it an honor and a privilege to stand here today in support of the nomination of John Ashcroft to be attorney general of the United States. Contrary to some of the rhetoric we've been hearing on the other side, everybody, and I say everybody, in this institution knows that he's one of the finest people who ever served here. He's a man of great religious faith and a moral man. And yet, as you listen to this debate, if it wasn't for the fact that it was so personally destructive and so vindictive, it would be humorous. Here you have a man who served six years in the United States Senate, served two terms as governor, two terms as the attorney general of the State of Missouri and yet to hear the debate here he's anti-child, he's anti-woman, he's anti-black, he's anti-gays, anti-Catholic. What else can possible be said? One thing we can be certainly be sure of: the left knows how to play politics and they do it well and I commend them for it.

Unfortunately, though, sometimes in politics you destroy unfairly the reputations of people who don't deserve it. And that's what offends me the most. And I'm not going to use the term anger, but it does offend me that this kind of personal destruction has to be used.

I recall the comments earlier in the debate today of Senator Leahy when he said that there are 280 million Americans with divergent ethnic backgrounds and political views. Well, out of that 280 million Americans, according to the left, if there are any of those 280 million Americans who are conservative and happen to be pro-life or pro-gun, they can't be attorney general. Now, if they are pro-choice or if they are anti-gun, then they can be. And I would again remind my colleagues that the vote on Janet Reno was 98 to nothing. I think most of us would, on this side of the aisle, would agree that her views and ours were quite different. But we supported her nomination because the president of the United States has a right to pick his or her cabinet, and that's a fact.

And I just want to say that some of the comments, especially as a Catholic, I just want to respond directly to this anti-Catholic charge. It's so outrageous. A man is -- I don't know how people can look in the mirror, to be candid about it, and do this, this kind of personal destruction. John Ashcroft, let me read the letter that I just received, a copy of the letter that I just received from Senator Kennedy's own cardinal, Cardinal Law. I'm going to read it into the record:

''Dear Senator Ashcroft, let me begin by expressing my deep dismay at the unfounded and scurrilous charge that you could possibly harbor anti-Catholic feelings. I was astounded to hear that anyone was making such a ridiculous accusation. From my time as bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau until today, I have always found you to be a man of honor, integrity and deep faith. I recall with great fondness the many opportunities we had to work together on many issues affecting the lives of the good people of the State of Missouri. In a particular way I recall how kind and thoughtful you were to invite me to address the cardinal's annual prayer breakfast on Jan. 9, 1992, when you were serving as the governor of Missouri. On that same day, you also honored me with an invitation to address the Governor's Leadership Forum on Faith and Values. College students, then and now, are beneficiaries of your generous love and concern for them and their futures. I do not recall that you made any distinction between black, white, Protestant, Catholic or Jew in your desire to instill in them a love for their faith, their families and one another as brothers and sisters in the human family. Let me assure you, John, of my prayers in asking God to bless you, Janet, the children and all whom you hold dear. And with warm regards, I am sincerely yours in Christ, Cardinal Law, Bernard Law, Archbishop of Boston.''
