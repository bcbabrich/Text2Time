To the Editor:

Iran did not, as you state in "Iran Resurgent" (editorial, Nov. 16), "seize" a strategic Persian Gulf island in September. Iran has partly controlled the island, Abu Musa, since 1971 under a settlement of gulf territorial disputes by Iran, Britain and the then new United Arab Emirates.

That settlement included: (a) Iran's relinquishing of its claim to Bahrain, with recognition of Bahrain's independence; (b) creation of the United Arab Emirates and its recognition by Iran; (c) repossession of the Tambs Islands by Iran, and (d) establishment of an Iran-Sharjah condominium over Abu Musa.

All other major powers and most Arab governments acquiesced in the arrangement. The brewing controversy in the Persian Gulf threatens to unravel this settlement in its entirety; bloodshed cannot be far behind.

Moreover, Iran's aggressiveness is not, as you suggest, fueled by the lack of restrictions in obtaining sophisticated "dual-use" technologies. On the contrary, the resurgence of radicalism in Iranian foreign policy is the effect of frustration with the Bush Administration's unfulfilled promises. President Bush said in his inauguration speech Jan. 20, 1989, that if Iran cooperated in repatriation of hostages, he would reciprocate by offering an olive branch. Through the good offices of President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the last United States hostage was repatriated this year; Iran gained nothing in return -- not even an olive branch.
