Just over two weeks ago, the Devils’ season appeared to be unraveling.

After losing at home to the Islanders, 1-0, on Nov. 16, the Devils were in the Atlantic Division basement with a 7-10-2 record. They had scored only 42 goals in their first 19 games — an average of 2.2 a game — and had lost three straight games as Martin Brodeur was attempting to notch his 500th career victory. (Listen as Marty discusses his milestone here.)

I had watched the Rangers defeat the Devils at the new arena in Newark on Nov. 14 in a way I had never seen — with patience and opportunistic scoring, formerly a Devils trademark! With Scott Gomez and Brian Rafalski lost to free agency, and with Brodeur another year older and possibly a little slower, it was getting easy to believe that the Devils were a team in decline and looking at a season that was only going to get worse.

So what happened? After shutting out the Canadiens, 4-0, Friday, the Devils had won their sixth game in a row and were only four points out of first place in the division!

While six games does not make a season, it is clear that this team cannot be counted out. Brodeur has been in net for all six games, allowing only seven goals and recording two shutouts. Zach Parise (7 goals, 6 assists) and Brian Gionta (5 goals, 5 assists), along with Jamie Langenbrunner (9 assists) have given a huge lift to an offense that has scored 22 goals during the six-game streak.

Were you one of the ones ready to count out the Devils? Do you think they will continue to improve as the season goes on? Will they win another division title?
