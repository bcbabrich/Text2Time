With the clock ticking down until Election Day and new polls showing that her re-election remains in doubt, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman turned her attention today to some of her softer areas of support, giving a speech on personal responsibility that seemed intended to appease social conservatives in the Republican Party and expressing her solidarity with minority voters who traditionally favor Democrats.

Mrs. Whitman, whose positions in favor of abortion and gay rights have alienated some fellow Republicans, told hundreds of teen-agers at Cedar Grove High School in Cedar Grove that she wanted to begin a dialogue with children in New Jersey about the importance of choosing between right and wrong.

Alluding to a number of widely publicized crimes by teen-agers in New Jersey over the last year, Mrs. Whitman said, ''We as adults have not been doing a very good job of communicating to you and the people coming up after you about consequences and responsibility.

''When you make a decision and take an action, there are going to be consequences,'' she said.

Later, Mrs. Whitman stood on a dais outside the Oak Avenue School in Orange, a relatively poor city that has traditionally been a Democratic stronghold, and accepted endorsements from several local black leaders.
