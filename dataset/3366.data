Kari Kohl, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes-1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Respond to a controversial statement on U.S. immigration policy.

2. Examine the dangerous conditions illegal immigrants will face to reach the U.S. by reading and discussing “The Desperate Risk Death in a Desert.”

3. Generate creative solutions to the immigration problem on the U.S.-Mexico border.

4. Formulate a coherent policy to present to U.S. lawmakers.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “The Desperate Risk Death in a Desert” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following (written on the board prior to class): “React to the following statement: The U.S. allows in too many immigrants and should tighten its borders.” Students then share their answers.

2. As a class, read and discuss “The Desperate Risk Death in a Desert,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why are there only wire fences to mark the tightly patrolled border between Mexico and the United States?

b. What does Mr. Flores worry about on his border crossing?

c. Why has the area around Sasabe, Mexico become the newest gateway for illegal immigrants?

d. How dangerous is crossing the Altar Desert? Why?

e. Why do people make the dangerous journey across the border?

f. What has been the effect of doubling the number of agents patrolling the border between Mexico and the U.S.?

g. What is being done to make immigration safer along the Arizona-Mexico border? Who is leading these efforts?

h. How have the towns along the border changed as illegal immigration has increased?

3. In the article, Roberto Rodriguez Hernandez, the Mexican Consul in Nogales, is quoted as saying, “We have to find more creative and imaginative ways; ways that address the need for workers in the United States and the lack of good opportunities in Mexico.” Students will brainstorm, in groups of three, to find some creative and imaginative ways to make changes that will affect the desire of Mexicans to emigrate. Students should be encouraged to think about creative economic solutions to the problem. After brainstorming these ideas, groups will share them with the class, and the teacher will make a list of possible solutions for the class to see and discuss.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Using the possible solutions brainstormed in class, students will write letters to their Senator or Representative to the U.S. Congress outlining plans to decrease illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. Students may choose to send these to their representatives in Washington.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Can you imagine being so poor and desperate that you would be willing to risk your life to improve your fortunes? What do you think that would be like? –If the situation in the United States became desperate and you needed to leave, where would you go? Why?

–How do illegal immigrants fit into the United States economy? What would happen if the U.S. succeeded in stopping all illegal immigration?

–The United States has recently increased the number of legal immigrants it allows to enter. Why has it done this? Why has this change made almost no difference in stopping illegal immigration from Mexico?

–Do you agree or disagree with Mexican government officials and human rights advocates who lay the blame for deaths in the Arizona desert on the “failures, and even cruelty, of recent United States border enforcement operations”?

–Do you think the border patrol’s job is to stop illegal immigrants or save them? Are these tasks mutually exclusive?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and small group discussions, and written homework assignments.

Vocabulary:

mountainous, terrain, barren, inhospitable, hypothermia, dehydration, enforcement, perilous, phenomenon, civilization, downtrodden, abandon, acquaintance, reassurance

Extension Activities:

1. Create a detailed map of the border between Mexico and the United States, with all the border towns and the geographical features. Mark the area written about in the featured article.

2. The European Union began as separate nations and has slowly turned into one large “market.” Study the steps the E.U. has taken to reach today’s status. Write an essay explaining if you think the same type of union might one day exist between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, whose NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) is similar to the beginnings of the E.U. Explain why you believe as you do.

3. Create an “Illegal Immigration” board game. Learn about the process of illegal immigration, and use this knowledge to create positive and negative scenarios for your players.

4. Brainstorm common American myths about Mexican culture. Then study the culture of the different states and regions of Mexico. Create a poster showing which myths are true and correcting commonly held misconceptions.

5. Write a first person autobiographical account of everyday life in Mexico, detailing the conditions that lead so many to choose the dangers of illegal immigration over staying where they are.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Create a timeline of U.S. immigration since 1900. For each decade document the number of immigrants (legal and estimates of illegal), their national origins, and any major changes in immigration law or policy.

Civics- Examine in detail the process of gaining citizenship in the United States. Create a visual display explaining each step of the process.

Fine Arts- Create a three-dimensional desert landscape such as the one illegal immigrants cross to get to Arizona. Try to evoke the conditions immigrants encounter during the perilous journey.

Journalism- Collect at least 5 articles about illegal immigration from a variety of sources. Compare the attitude of each author toward illegal immigration, the immigrants themselves, coyotes, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the United States Border Patrol.

Other Information on the Web:

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (//www.ins.usdoj.gov/graphics/index.htm) provides information on immigration services and benefits, legislation updates, and news on border management.

National Immigration Forum (NIF) (//www.immigrationforum.org/) defends legal immigration, fights anti-immigrant prejudice, and seeks to preserve the American tradition of diversity.

U.S. Border Control (//www.usbc.org/) supports legislation to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling, restore national security, and develop fair and effective immigration policy.
