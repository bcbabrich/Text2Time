New York State’s Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, apologized this afternoon for making an off-hand comment that Senator Charles E. Schumer “will put a bullet between the President’s eyes, if he could get away with it.” He called the comments “incredibly stupid and moronic’’ and insisted that he is “not a person of violence.’’

“Nobody feels worse about this than I do,’’ Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, said during a hastily arranged news conference in midtown Manhattan. “I have made thousands of speeches. And I have never done anything like that.’’

Mr. Hevesi made the provocative comments earlier in the day during a commencement ceremony at Queens College, where he took a moment to praise Senator Schumer, who was also speaking there, for the senator’s willingness to challenge the policies of the Republican president.
