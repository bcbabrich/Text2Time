They call it ''biaotai,'' and it is a standard technique of Chinese Communism revived by the recent anti-Government upheaval and its suppression.

The word means ''to express an attitude.'' What happens is that people in offices, institutes, schools and the military all over the country are called on to express their attitude about recent events.

The performance, a Chinese said, is just that: a performance that does not necessarily reflect what the speaker thinks. Everyone knows what to say, which is currently something like this:

''I resolutely support the quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion, which was created by a very small number of ruffians whose ultimate goal was the overthrow of socialism and the creation of a capitalist republic for China. China needs above all stability and unity so that it can modernize. I fully support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech in which he made a penetrating analysis of the causes of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.''

The practice of biaotai, which was developed by the Communist revolutionaries even before their victory in 1949, has given rise to a different, bittersweet term, ''shuo wei xin hua,'' which means ''to speak against your heart.''
