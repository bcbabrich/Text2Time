DUKE--Anthony. Anthony "Tony" Drexel Duke (1918-2014). It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to our beloved founder, Anthony "Tony" Drexel Duke, founder and president of Boys & Girls Harbor. Tony died on April 30, 2014 after a long battle with cancer. He was 95. The entire Harbor community, while grieving Tony's death, will observe his passing by celebrating his extraordinary legacy. Tony spent a lifetime educating children, growing Boys & Girls Harbor, the education and performing arts nonprofit he founded in 1937, from a small summer camp for 12 inner-city boys to an arts and education organization that serves 1,000 students and their families from Harlem and surrounding communities. To date, more than 50,000 young people have attended the Harbor. Tony's compassion and generous gifts were widely known among New York's charitable circles, but he was far more than just a patron. From the Harbor's early days until a few years before his death, Tony was a fixture at the organization, developing personal relationships with Harbor staff, students, and alumni. He made sure that the Harbor served as a real home and learning environment for students. The Harbor deeply mourns the loss of Tony, a true living legend.
