When Michelle Grewe was going through some boxes in her grandfather’s house, she found a cache of writing by her grandmother, Eleanor Virginia Webster. Among other things, she’d written out her “Ten Tips to Happiness” on a series of 20 postcards, sometime during the war in Vietnam. No one in her family had seen the postcards, or realized that Eleanor, who died in 1998, was a closet writer. Michelle and I both thought “all of you young people” would appreciate her grandmother’s words. — KJ Dell’Antonia

Ten Tips to Happiness

By Eleanor Virginia Webster

The following story is a true one for the purpose of encouraging all of you young people who are so mixed up now with the present war in Vietnam, birth control dilemma, religious rebellion and the ever present political problems.

It was the second world war. Everyone was so mixed up. Should we get married now or wait until the war is over? That was the $64.00 question. By the way, that was a lot of money then. Now it must be $6,400, at least.

Well I decided and got married. My husband was in the Army. I traveled with him. No Children! That’s what we said. No children till the war is over. So we were very careful. Then came the terrible day we knew would come: the overseas alert. Yes it was all a deep military secret, but nevertheless, he was going to the South Pacific. He was going out of my life for a while. Will he be back? I hoped so, but it was all so uncertain.

The next two years were a blank. I worked. I ate (I guess). I moved around, but in a daze. Then came the day that I received a letter from my husband. He was scheduled to be sent to Japan, right in the middle of the worst fighting. My heart became a stone. I guess I died a little. Then two days later, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The war was over. It was V.J. Day. This was a moment never to be forgotten. My heart took wings, it was over. Praise be to God. Then the town and cities everywhere began to celebrate. It was wonderful.

Now my husband was on his way home, finally after two years of waiting. There he was. It was early morning. It was foggy. I stood on the porch of our home. He looked so wonderful, but when we finally got together again, I had to get acquainted all over. It was like meeting for the first time and knowing that we loved one another.

We adjusted and decided we wanted a family. Now when we wanted one, we couldn’t have our baby. Something was wrong. Three years went by, but no baby. Finally in desperation, I saw a doctor. He examined me and said I was run down. I went through much treatment and finally one day he said! “You are ready.”

Now when I look back, it seems so long ago. I was the one that only wanted two children. It seems that when I was a teenager, I even hated children. Awful? Yes it was, but I didn’t really. But remember once you start, it will be easy. It was. We had four lovely daughters and three wonderful sons. I’ve never been so happy. I’ve enjoyed my children to the fullest.

Now to the point of all this. If you have large family, you needn’t be hum drum or a mess in plain words. You can still be expecting and enjoy everything life has to offer. Here are the basic rules.

1. Enjoy your children, appreciate every new development. Be proud of them, no matter how many or how few you have.

2. Give them a lot of love. This includes discipline and cut down on gifts. You can’t buy their love.

3. Help them to develop some talent. Encourage them in what they want. Not what you want.

4. Keep yourself neat and slim. Don’t let yourself into a mess. You can keep a good figure. This is a must.

5. Let your husband know you love him and are as concerned about him as you are about your children.

6. Keep active. Develop your personality and keep on studying. You are never too old to learn.

7. Keep religion in your home and develop your children in this respect. Attend church with your children and husband.

8. Keep an interest in things in the school your children attend. In your church, in your community, be interested.

9. Get an interest of your own. Something you enjoy. Let your husband do his thing too.

10. Also try to do something or go somewhere with your husband alone.

With these ten things, you will find happiness as I have and be a better person. Don’t worry about the children you may have. God knows what’s good for us. I know I have been married twenty seven years and I am happy.
