So what does Tyco International look like without the accounting gimmickry? Tyco's chief executive, Edward D. Breen, acknowledged yesterday that it is not the fast-growth, high-margin collection of assets that L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive, loved to compare to General Electric.

Still, Mr. Breen proudly proclaimed in a conference call with investors that ''we're going to grow this business back for the future,'' now that Tyco has completed its internal investigation, which uncovered a pattern of aggressive accounting and prompted a $382 million restatement in earnings.

But the company will never be the Tyco that Mr. Kozlowski dreamed of.

The new Tyco, though still viable, is what skeptics always thought it was: a hodgepodge of consistently profitable but unconnected, slow-growth businesses that produced things as diverse as surgical gear and home-security systems. Mr. Breen's reiterated earnings forecast for 2003 of $1.50 to $1.75 a share acknowledged as much.

Without a steady stream of acquisitions -- and the artificially inflated earnings boost that Tyco engineered for the first couple of quarters after each deal was completed -- the consistent growth that made Tyco a highflying stock in the last couple of years is over. And there is going to be a bumpy road ahead.
