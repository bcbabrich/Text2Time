''I got a phone call and was told to call the Governor,'' Mr. Yevoli said. ''He got on the phone and said he wanted me to know this literature would be coming out. 'Lew,' he said, 'this is the kind of thing that's going to happen if you continue in your opposition.' Do I think he's behind it? All I know is that suddenly, mysteriously, came this literature the next day.'' 'Psychological Blackmail'

Senator James J. Lack, a Suffolk County Republican named in one of the pamphlets, called them ''psychological blackmail.''

''Do they really think,'' he said, ''that they can put some lies in a brochure and that I'm going to say: 'Oh, my, my, Mario's going to get me. I'd better make a public announcement Mario's right'? Does he think all the substantive points I raised I really didn't think were meaningful? That I made them up? That with threats and blackmail, they go away?''

The Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans, has said it will not take up the Shoreham bill unless the Assembly, which is Democratic controlled, does so first. Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker, says he will not take it up unless a majority of the seven Assembly Democrats from the Island support it. But so far, four of the seven oppose it. As a result, Mr. Cuomo has concentrated his attacks on them.

''Of course it bothers me, sure it bothers me,'' Mr. Miller said when asked if he was disturbed by the attacks on Democrats. ''He's playing the Republicans' game. It's a cheap shot, and it's no way to get this bill.''

Mr. Cuomo implied that the Speaker should overrule the four Assemblymen. ''It presents an interesting question for the Assembly leadership,'' he said. ''Mel's quoted as saying he agrees with the deal. If you agree with the Governor that this is important to the safety of 2.7 million Long Islanders, what do yo do with the four people who disagree?'' A Special Session Hinted

Mr. Cuomo has brought more and more of the weight of his office to bear. He says that, if necessary, he will convene a special session of the Legislature on Shoreham. He will travel to the Island this week to speak on a local television show. He has taken the unusual step of attacking legislators by name at news conferences and on radio.
