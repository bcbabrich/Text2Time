NO sooner is Willie Nelson released from jail after serving 20 years for trying to rob a train, than he gets together that old gang of his and goes off to try to rob a train again. He knows that an ex-Texas Ranger, Richard Widmark, who stopped him the first time, will be out to get him again, with that old gang of his.

Old is the key word in ''Once Upon a Texas Train,'' the two-hour television movie on Channel 2 at 9 P.M. Sunday. Some of the robbers and lawmen hauled out of retirement have trouble shooting in the right direction, staying in the saddle and telling a horse from a bicycle.

The notion of a tale about aging cowboys is not exactly original, but this easygoing effort, written, produced and directed by Burt Kennedy, ambles amiably along as the pals regroup and head toward the bend of the Rio Brazos, only to discover that the river has long since dried up and the railroad tracks have been torn up. Just about then, durn it, the script dries up or goes off the track, stranding all parties, like the little engine that couldn't.

Mr. Kennedy tries to keep things chugging by bringing in Angie Dickinson, who won the hearts of both Mr. Widmark and Mr. Nelson when they were comrades in the Confederate Army. She looks mighty good for a gal from the Old Confederacy and smiles lovingly upon both her creaky suitors, but such affairs produce no steam. Then, there is a gang of young baddies who dare to confront the old baddies, a prolonged encounter that makes little sense even for a television western. The chief young baddie gets to kiss a pretty miss who is brought on for no other reason than to be kissed. It is an uphill trip before the final improbable shoot-out between the generations in one of those empty towns whose only industry is shoot-outs.
