Joe Torre's 65-year-old brother, Frank, will watch the first round of the playoffs from the same hospital room he watched the Yankees win the World Series from last year.

Frank Torre, who underwent a successful heart transplant operation in the midst of the World Series last Oct. 26, was admitted to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center last Friday for treatment of infections related to the transplant operation, according to Dr. Donna M. Mancini, head of Columbia-Presbyterian's heart transplant program.

Mancini said that two infections had inflamed Torre's throat and parts of his colon. He is being treated with antibiotics and is expected to be released Saturday, Mancini said.

''He doesn't look bad,'' she said. ''He doesn't feel bad. He doesn't have a fever. He's responding to the drugs well. We don't anticipate there's going to be a problem.''
