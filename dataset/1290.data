Related Article A Breast-Feeding Plan Mixes Reactions This article prompted e-mails to the Public Editor regarding the use of anonymous blog quotes.

Kate Zernike, in her report on Michelle Obama’s effort to promote breast-feeding, went to the blogs to canvas political comment. There, she found a surprising number of people crossing political boundaries to express support or opposition.

But reader Michael Denham of Boston questioned the quality of the sourcing of the story, as did other readers who contacted the public editor’s office. Mr. Denham noted a quote in the story that was attributed only as “one person on a blog” – and an anonymous one at that.

“One person on a blog does not a citation make,” he wrote in an email. “Upon reading it, I felt uneasy with the utter lack of sourcing.”

The story, which was published online Feb. 17, demonstrates a problem inherent in using blogs for quote fodder. If you were to identify a hierarchy of sources by quality, an anonymous blogger would have to occupy the bottom rung, or near it.

The Times’s policy on anonymous sourcing describes the use of anonymous sources as a “last resort to obtain information that we believe to be newsworthy and reliable.” The policy goes on to say that the identity of every anonymous source should be known by at least one editor. Unfortunately, it is all but impossible to know the identity of an anonymous blogger.

That said, I can see some merit in reporting on how a particular political controversy is playing out in the blogosphere, so long as that is clearly described as the basis of the story.

In this case, the story went some distance toward doing this – in the third paragraph, the story said, “On blogs and in interviews, some liberal Democrats found themselves agreeing with Representative Bachmann, a Tea Party celebrity from Minnesota, when she criticized the first lady for a campaign to promote breast-feeding. Some conservatives, meanwhile, stood up for Mrs. Obama for promoting what they said was a healthier choice.”

Ms. Zernike told me her reporting included interviews, as well as the blog material, and that interviewees were reluctant to be quoted. The blog material supported what she was hearing in her interviews, she said.

“I wouldn’t have taken only blog postings, but given that they backed up what I was hearing elsewhere – and that this was generating so much comment online – they seemed to be relevant,” she said.

Rick Berke, the national editor, said, “Kate’s piece tried to capture the huge outpouring on different sides on the blogs.”But she had a difficult time getting people on the record, he said. “I wished we had explained this outpouring and how people did not want to speak for quotation. We should have also better identified the specific blog posts. We generally shy away from anonymous blog quotes.”

The Times’s anonymous blog quotes may add color to a story but they don’t bring much more.
