In the last few days, environmental arguments against a huge new hydroelectric project proposed in Quebec have become far more likely to force further delay in the signing of a 20-year, $19.5 billion contract between Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power Authority, and in the project's construction.

At a forum Thursday night in Manhattan, the chairman of the Power Authority, Richard M. Flynn, said that an environmental review of the project's effects in Canada, including effects on native Cree and Inuits, might take 18 months to three years. Therefore, he said, his agency will not sign the agreement by Nov. 30 as it earlier agreed.

"We're certainly not going to finalize agreement while there are important questions left on either side of the border," Mr. Flynn said.

The authority, under pressure from environmentalists in New York, had asked Hydro-Quebec, which is developing the project east of Hudson Bay in northern Quebec, to determine its effects on animal and plant species. Opponents argue that it would destroy a wilderness, harm animal species and increase mercury pollution.
