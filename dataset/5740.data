In a break with tradition, leaders of the Republican and Conservative Parties in Suffolk County have decided not to endorse two judges from their own parties seeking re-election.

The judges, Surrogate Ernest L. Signorelli, a Republican who holds what is considered the most politically influential judgeship in the county, and Judge Harry E. Campbell of Family Court, a Conservative, said they would challenge the decisions by seeking renomination in the Sept. 10 Republican and Conservative primaries.

The surrogates and Family Court judges serve 10-year terms.

Republican leaders said they would abide by the decision of the Conservatives about Judge Campbell, and the Conservative leaders said they would honor the Republicans' decision about Judge Signorelli.

Reasons for Decisions

The judges said they thought that they were being denied renomination because they were the victims of party politics. Both have been rated qualified by the Suffolk County Bar Association.
