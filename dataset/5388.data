''We ran, all right - and ran and ran and ran.''

Chamberlain now lives in the exclusive area of Bel Air in Los Angeles, in a $1.5 million mansion he had built about 15 years ago. Now 50 years old, he seems to have aged little. Occasionally, there is still a report that some N.B.A. team wants to sign him for part of a season. He laughs about this, and graciously declines. When last seen in Manhattan, over the summer, Chamberlain was still a well-chiseled specimen, with a slim waist and biceps the size of, well, not quite watermelons, but cantaloupes, anyway. He is still busy in sports, and is an avid volleyball player, and retains ambitions of playing for the 1988 United States Olympic team.

But now he was looking back instead of forward, back to that Friday night 25 years ago in Hershey. It was a rather small arena, seating 7,200, and a crowd of 4,124 showed up.

''It's amazing,'' Chamberlain recalled in a telephone interview recently, ''but I'll bet I've had 25,000 come up to me and say they saw the game. What's more amazing is, most of them say they saw it at Madison Square Garden. That's some feat. Can you imagine how good their eyes were?''

One person who was not at the game was Phil Jordan, the Knicks' starting center, who was ill. Eddie Donovan, the coach of the last-place Knicks, started his second-string center, Darrall Imhoff. It was Imhoff's assignment to guard Chamberlain -with, of course, help from the forwards when possible, as was the case with all the centers in the N.B.A. who played Wilt. ''You're all I've got tonight,'' Donovan told Imhoff. ''Try not to foul out.''

Imhoff tried, but didn't succeed. ''He was getting down the court so fast I couldn't keep up with him,'' recalled Imhoff, who played a total of 20 minutes and fouled out in the fourth quarter. ''We tried collapsing three guys around him, but it didn't help.''

Chamberlain recalled that he hit his first six jump shots from the outside, and at the end of the first quarter the Warriors were ahead, 42-26. Chamberlain had 23 points, including 9 straight free throws.

''Remember, I was a notoriously bad free-throw shooter in games,'' said Chamberlain. ''But now I thought I might break a record, but it was for consecutive free throws. Breaking the single-game record for total points didn't enter my head -not even at the half.''
