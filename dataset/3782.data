The T. Eaton Company Ltd., owner of Canada's best-known chain of department stores, has declared the equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Eaton's, which has a debt load of more than $350 million, sought court protection on Thursday under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. This will give the company four months to devise a restructuring plan. The move could mean closing up to 40 of the company's 87 stores. Eaton's creditors and suppliers will not be paid for anything billed before Thursday until a restructuring plan is approved. Eaton's owes the Toronto Dominion Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia $160 million. It has turned to GE Capital Canada, which will provide $555 million to let the company continue to operate.
