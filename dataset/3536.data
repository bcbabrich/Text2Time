It may not have the cultural or political wattage of New York City, but Hartford has touched off its own tussle over taste and publicly financed art.

Hartford officials, prompted by complaints from more than a dozen citizens and a member of City Council, have postponed a sexually charged exhibit that was scheduled to open on Oct. 21 in a city gallery, in a city park, next to a city playground.

The centerpiece of the exhibit, ''Domesticated Pleasures,'' is a set of seven ceramic sexual devices, one for each day of the week.

''It's sort of like a calendar,'' said the artist, Tanya Batura.

But many callers to City Hall said yesterday that they found it more like pornography. They compared Miss Batura's show to the exhibition scheduled to open tomorrow at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
