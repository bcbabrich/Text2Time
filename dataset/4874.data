It's not surprising that Americans save less than people in other industrial countries. Our society, after all, does a better job at selling the pleasures of consumption than it does at teaching the virtues of saving. Although advertising may magnify the problem, it is not the cause. Americans are undisciplined savers because our society not only tolerates, but encourages, investment illiteracy. Unless we tackle this, many of us will find the American dream unaffordable.

At the root of the problem lies our habit of viewing economic and social issues in isolation, or, worse, in conflict. In newspapers and televised news coverage, business matters are often relegated to their own section, as if they affected only a select audience. And when financial issues do take the limelight, it's often when social or political forces are called in to check the excesses of the business world. So many Americans consider economic and social goals to be inherently in conflict that the mutual-fund industry has launched "socially conscious funds" -- as if other funds pursue goals at odds with beneficial social behavior.

But investing, by its very nature, is a socially conscious act. On a broad level, investing provides the capital that finances goods and services -- the books that make our lives fuller, say. On a more personal level, the discipline of investing -- rather than spending -- insures that you are an economic benefit, rather than a burden, to society. Obviously, one individual's investing won't cure all our social ills; neither will one person's recycling solve our ecological problems. But in both cases, the solutions start at home.

That Americans will rally for a social cause like the environment but feel no remorse for their lack of savings demonstrates our investment illiteracy. Many Americans simply do not make the connection that spending to the limit, living beyond one's means, has social consequences -- reducing America's competitiveness by cutting into funding for research and development, for example.
