Mr. Pyle said Vietnam was, for many journalists, an indefinable experience that altered their lives. "Vietnam was a magnetic force -- you can't define it," Mr. Pyle said. "It wasn't just the best story of our careers, it transcended that. We all moved on to other things, but we all have Vietnam in our systems forever. You never really get away from Vietnam. It's always there."

Authors as varied as Mr. Maugham and Mr. Greene have used similar words to describe a city that changes but doesn't really, a city thick with the scent of jasmine and spice and motor fuel, a city that seems mysterious even when it's not.

The narrow street adjacent to the Continental and Caravelle Hotels in downtown Ho Chi Minh City reflects some of the city's transformation. The French knew the street as Rue Catinat, a street whose cafes and shops served as the center of colonial life for decades. After the French left in 1954, the South Vietnamese changed the street's name to Tu Do, or Freedom. The influx of American soldiers led to a flood of bars and prostitutes. After the war, the Vietnamese changed the street's name to Dong Khoi, or Uprising. In recent years, the street has mirrored the nation's economic confidence, with upscale shops and boutiques interspersed with more modest ones. The remnants of colonialism and the G.I.'s are gone.

For some of the foreign journalists here, one attempted meeting was a visit to the home of Pham Xuan An. Mr. An was one of the more celebrated Vietnamese journalists working in Saigon in the 1960's and 1970's, a reporter for Reuters before joining Time Magazine, and especially popular with journalists for the larger newspapers and magazines, and visiting editors and columnists. Mr. An was elegant, candid and seemed highly informed about the inner workings of the South Vietnamese government. He was also an espionage agent for North Vietnam.

According to an English-language paperback book purchased here, "Pham Xuan An: a General of the Secret Service," by Hoang Hao Van and Tan Tu, Mr. An was actually a retired major general and a top intelligence officer in the Vietnam People's Army. The book said Mr. An was trusted by the Central Intelligence Agency and extremely close to the Saigon government run by Nguyen Van Thieu. But how Mr. An operated as a journalist and intelligence agent and what he accomplished as a spy remains a mystery.

By phone, Mr. An said he had emphysema and took ill at the moment to chat. "I was born in 1927," he said. "I'm 78. I'm the same age as Fidel Castro. I'm two years older than Arafat, but he's gone now."
