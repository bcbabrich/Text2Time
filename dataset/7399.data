The Worcester, Mass., Art Museum announced yesterday the acquisition of probably the most famous and certainly one of the finest early American paintings, “Portrait of Mrs. Elizabeth Freake and Baby Mary.”

The less well‐known but worthy companion portrait of John Freake, the husband and father, was acquired at the same time. Yesterday at the museum the portraits were put on public view for the first time in 20 years.

Painted nearly 300 years ago when the Freakes were residents of Boston, the portraits have been in Worcester County for more than 200 years, having been brought first to Oxford, Mass., by Baby Mary's grandson and heir, Josiah Wolcott, when he settled there.

Worcester's acquisition of two paintings coveted by major museums all over the country came about in part because of the owners’ wish that they should remain in the county.
