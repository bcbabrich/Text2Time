DETROIT, April 2 (UPI)—The Detroit Red Wings moved into third place tonight, a point in front of the idle Montreal Cana diens, in the nip‐and‐tuck East ern Division battle in the Na tional Hockey League by down ing the Toronto Maple Leafs, 4‐2. The victory gave the Wings a three‐point edge over the New York Rangers, who also did not play tonight.

The triumph gave the Wings a total of 93 points, two behind Chicago and Boston, who are tied for first. Each team has only two games remaining in the regular season.

The Wings, led by Alex Del vecchio, wasted no time taking charge. Delvecchio pushed the puck past the Toronto goalie, Bruce Gamble, after 16 seconds of play for his 20th goal of the season—the 11th time he has, reached that mark in 19 years in the N.H.L.

Delvecchio assisted on two more goals, Gordie Howe's 28th of the season and Frank Mahov lich's 37th. Both came in the second period. The other Wings score was tallied by Gary Berg man, who took a pass from Paul Popiel at 6:10 of the first period.
