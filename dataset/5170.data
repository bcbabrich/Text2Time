For student organizations, rental space at Harvard has always been hard to come by. Now, it's more costly as well, as Harvard raises rental fees for the first time in a decade, in some cases. The largest group affected is Harvard Student Agencies, a student-run corporation that provides jobs for hundreds of undergraduates, writing and publishing the popular ''Let's Go'' series of travel books.

On July 1, the rent on H.S.A.'s 3,566-square-foot offices in the basement of Thayer Hall, a dormitory, was raised from $4,100 to $12,000, The Perspective, a Harvard student magazine, recently reported in an editorial. It could not be learned from university officials if the figures - representing close to a 300-percent increase -were correct, and H.S.A. officials refused to confirm or deny them.

Martha Gester, associate dean of the college, explained that since H.S.A. is a business, it could cover more of the building expenses on its own. ''The basic philosophy and the agreement in the beginning is that they should cover costs,'' she said. ''There is not a good reason for the university to subsidize them.''

Gina Berardi, a senior, president of H.S.A., agreed that the increase was justified, and noted, ''We are not complaining.''
