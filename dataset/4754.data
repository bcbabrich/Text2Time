Iraq has very little money to pay war reparations, and had overdue debts to many creditors even before it invaded Kuwait, current and former United States Government officials and other experts say.

The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Oct. 29 that made Iraq liable for war damage and losses suffered by Kuwait and other countries. When President Bush specified Wednesday the allies' conditions for a permanent cease-fire, he included Baghdad's "acceptance in principle of Iraq's responsibility to pay compensation for the loss, damage and injury its aggression has caused."

Iraq said Wednesday that it would comply with all 12 resolutions.

But forcing Iraq to pay reparations will be difficult, given its lack of money, and will conflict with other American interests, said Richard W. Murphy, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. Empty Coffers Influence War

Iraq's near-empty treasury has been a cause of the war and an obstacle to its conclusion.

On Feb. 15, when Iraq first said it would consider negotiating a withdrawal, one condition was the cancellation of its foreign debts and thoseof neighbors who had not assisted the allied war effort.
