To the Sports Editor:

I read with sympathy about Jeff Hostetler's putting his playing career on hold (''Hostetler Puts Focus on Paralyzed Son,'' The Times, July 25) after his son had a serious accident riding on a recreational vehicle. Hostetler said he is looking into starting a foundation for people with paralysis. A wonderful foundation already exists, the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis.

If Hostetler wants to put his name on a worthy cause, maybe he should start an organization that seeks to educate the public, especially young people, about the dangers of driving these so-called ''recreational vehicles.''
