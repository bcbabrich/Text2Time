A suit was filed In Federal Court here yesterday to prevent the confinement of children considered “incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient.”

The suit seeks s the convening of a three‐judge panel to declare a state law unconstitutional for using “hopelessly vague” standards to confine children in state training schools or temporary detention facilities.

“This suit Is the beginning of an intensive and systematic effort to establish civil liberties for children,” according to Ira Glasser, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

Conditions Called Cruel

“All over this state,” he said, “children who have committed no crimes are incarcerated with little or no due process, confined under duel and coercive conditions, and abused under color of law. We hope to persuade the courts that children are people within the meaning of our Constitution.”
