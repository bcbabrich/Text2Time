Three compilation albums aimed at teenage fans vied for the top spots on this week’s Billboard chart. “Now That’s What I Call Music!” Vol. 30, with songs by Lady GaGa, Britney Spears, Pussycat Dolls and others, reached No. 1 with 146,000 sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan, followed by the soundtrack to “Hannah Montana: The Movie” (Disney), with 139,000, and the “Twilight” soundtrack (Atlantic), with 102,000. Keri Hilson’s new album, “In a Perfect World …” (Interscope), opened at No. 4 with 94,000 sales, and Kelly Clarkson‘s “All I Ever Wanted” (RCA) is No. 5 with 52,000. In a week crowded with high-charting new releases, Papa Roach’s “Metamorphosis” (Interscope) reached No. 8, Jim Jones’s “Pray IV Reign” (Columbia) opened at No. 9, Martina McBride’s “Shine” (RCA Nashville) is No. 10, and Mastodon’s “Crack the Skye” (Reprise) bowed at No. 11.

Some of the most notable sales of last week were for albums that do not qualify for Billboard’s standard chart because they were released more than 18 months ago. A reissue of Pearl Jam‘s debut album, “Ten” (Epic/Legacy), is No. 1 on Billboard’s catalog chart with sales of 60,000, the fifth-biggest total among all albums last week, and more than new releases by Ms. Clarkson, U2 and Lady GaGa. After Smokey Robinson appeared on “American Idol” last week, download sales jumped for classic Motown songs like “Tracks of My Tears” and “Signed, Sealed, Delivered,” and two compilation albums also got boosts: “Motown #1s,” released five years ago, sold 5,000 copies, and “Motown #1s Vol. 2,” released in 2007, moved 6,000; those had combined sales of less than 1,000 the week before.
