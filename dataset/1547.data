LOS ANGELES — A crowd of finance-starved filmmakers wanted to know where the money was.

They were at a symposium on state-sponsored incentives for film production at the Landmark Theater here on Friday, and the news was mostly bad.

Iowa’s subsidy program has collapsed in the face of a criminal investigation. New Jersey’s is suspended. California spent its $100 million yearly allotment of tax credits in one day.

But there is new money on the way, insisted Schuyler Moore, a veteran film lawyer with the firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, who spoke to fellow panelists at the symposium, organized by the Incentives Office consulting firm.

From where?

Mr. Moore said. “It’s absolutely coming.”

Less comforting was Mr. Moore’s assurance that Chinese film investors would be looking not so much for monetary return as cultural influence.

The key, he said, is to “find a project that portrays their culture in a positive light.”

Roland Emmerich’s “2012,” backed by the Japanese-owned Sony Corporation and shot in Los Angeles and Canada, showed how a Hollywood film could give China a boost, Mr. Moore said.

In that one, as much of the planet was being destroyed by tidal waves, China saved the day with a bunch of ingeniously built arks — and the film was a blockbuster in Beijing.

If Chinese plot lines don’t appeal, Mr. Moore suggested that producers keep an eye on the trading in box-office futures, a proposed practice that was ostensibly banned by the federal government’s financial reform act.

“There’s a way through that,” said Mr. Moore, who did not trace the exact path.
