Poles lined up today at banks to buy shares in the first five state-run companies to be sold to individual shareholders under the country's post-Communist economic program.

Five companies are being privatized in the first round: the Krosno glass works; Kielce, a construction company; Exbud, a textile company in Lodz; Prochnik, a Silesian cable factory, and Tonsil, an audio equipment company.

Share prices ranged from 50,000 zlotys (about $5) to 112,000 zlotys (about $12). The minimum purchase was five shares.

Ultimately, some 7,000 companies, representing more than 80 percent of the Polish economy, are to be transferred from state to private ownership or otherwise liquidated in the drive to create a capitalist economy and an investment market.
