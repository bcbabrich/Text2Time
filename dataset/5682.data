The slaying of a Chinese-American author in California has created a national scandal here.

Much about the case remains a mystery, especially whether there was a deliberate decision to kill the author, Henry Liu, and if so, why. But already the slaying, which occurred last October, appears to have strained Taiwan's relations with the United States, the biggest market for this island nation's abundant exports and its main arms supplier.

Mr. Liu, under the pen name Chiang Nan, was the author of a gossipy, critical biography of Taiwan's President, Chiang Ching-kuo, first published in book form in 1975.

The biography, according to the editor of a dissident magazine, was ''more irritating to the authorities than damaging.'' The book dealt with aspects of the 74-year-old President's life that go unmentioned in the state-controlled press: Mr. Chiang's early infatuation with Communism, his 12 years of living in the Soviet Union and his illegitimate son. These facts might prove embarrassing to the President of a nation whose official policy is strongly anti- Communist and that prefers its leaders to display a Confucian asceticism.

Intelligence Agents Implicated

Still, a recently published version of the biography, dealing more with the President's later life, is less damaging than the earlier volume. Besides, journalists point out, it is tame compared with what is published in dissident magazines in Taiwan these days.
