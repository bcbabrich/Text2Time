KEENAN REYNOLDS The Navy senior quarterback scored twice in the fourth quarter to tie the collegiate mark for career rushing touchdowns, and the Midshipmen set a team record with three 100-yard rushers in a 29-17 home victory over South Florida.

The Midshipmen did not lead until Reynolds bulled in from the 1 to make it 22-17 with 6 minutes 58 seconds left. After South Florida fumbled on the ensuing kickoff, Reynolds clinched the win with another 1-yard touchdown run with 1:49 remaining.

Reynolds scored his 77th career rushing touchdown, tying the former Wisconsin running back Montee Ball (2009-12) for the most in N.C.A.A. history.

“It’s just a number,” Reynolds said of his touchdown total. “At the end of the day, it was just about getting ahead and putting the game out of reach. We were able to execute that play. It’s a big deal, obviously. I am very blessed and fortunate. But I always deflect the attention to my teammates because it’s 11 guys out there working.”
