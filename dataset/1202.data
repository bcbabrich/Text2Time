Chris Smith said he experienced poor cellphone reception for most of Tuesday. When Smith was able to get a rare signal, he received a text message from his agent, Marc Cornstein, that read, “Call me ASAP.”

A day later, Smith, a guard from Louisville who is the younger brother of J. R. Smith, realized a dream when he signed with the Knicks.

“I’m ecstatic,” Chris Smith said. “The process was really amazing. It means a lot for me and my family.”

Cornstein and Smith declined to disclose the details of the deal, but it is probably a one-year, nonguaranteed contract.

“We’re thrilled with the deal,” Cornstein said. “Chris is excited about signing his first N.B.A. contract and playing next to his brother.”

Smith was the first one to let Knicks fans know he was joining his brother. He announced the signing on his Twitter account by posting a picture of himself signing the contract while sitting next to General Manager Glen Grunwald.

Then Smith sent the picture to his brother to alert him to the news.

“I was pretty much just smiling,” Smith said. “Then, I started thinking about what can I do to stay here and be an asset to this team.”

Smith, 24, will get his chance to make the roster when training camp begins in early October. The odds will be against him. The Knicks already have seven guards on their roster.

Cornstein said one advantage Smith has is his brother. J. R. Smith should help his brother learn Coach Mike Woodson’s system and how to get prepared for training camp.

“I think it can help tremendously in having your big brother there and getting advice from him on a day-to-day basis,” Cornstein said.

Smith will be joined by forward Chris Copeland as the only players likely to enter camp without a guaranteed contract.

Smith and Copeland played for the Knicks’ summer league team last month in Las Vegas. Copeland led the team with 13.8 points a game. The 6-foot-2 Smith averaged 5.2 points and 2 rebounds. His best game came against the Toronto Raptors when he had 10 points and 3 rebounds.

Smith said he remembered talking to Woodson during the summer league and that Woodson encouraged him to get better.

“I learned how to use the pick-and-roll and to be actually humble,” Smith said. “That’s a big process in this league. I found that out pretty early.”

At many of the Knicks’ summer league games, J. R. Smith sat courtside to watch his brother play. The two also spoke after games.

“He’s very excited for me,” Chris Smith said of his brother. “It’s great for my situation. I just finished college, and I’m starting a new life. He’s really helped me with all these aspects of life.”

Cornstein said the Knicks began negotiations with Smith soon after the summer league ended.

“He was able to make somewhat of an impression on the Knicks and not just in games, but also in practice,”

Cornstein said of Smith, who the Knicks see as a combo guard, “I think he showed some of his versatility.”

Smith could be assigned to the Erie BayHawks, the Knicks’ Development League affiliate, if he does not stay with the team after training camp.

At Louisville, Smith played point guard. He helped lead the Cardinals the Final Four last season while averaging 9.2 points and 3.6 rebounds a game. The Cardinals also won the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden.

J. R. Smith also signed a two-year deal with the Knicks in July worth $2.8 million in the first year, with a player option for the second. After joining the team in February, Smith averaged 12.5 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists.

Now, Chris Smith is hoping to build his career next to his brother.

“Everything is set for me to be a successful story,” he said. “I know I’m a rookie. I feel like I have a great chance.”
