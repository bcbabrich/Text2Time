Could London eclipse New York as the world’s hedge fund capital? If so, it would likely take a while. The Economist reports that New York (counting the leafy Connecticut suburbs, chiefly Greenwich) is home to roughly twice as many fund managers, but London managers (many of them headquartered in Mayfair, a Greenwich analogue) generated twice the returns of their New York peers last year, giving the city a new cachet that is attracting more money and talent.

In London, as in New York, the rise of hedge funds is “changing the face of financial services,” the magazine writes. “Increasingly, talented financial professionals are abandoning big investment banks for small firms.”

There are differences between the two financial capitals, in terms of investment strategies. The Economist explains:

Data from Hedge Fund Research, a consultancy, show that in the second quarter, a share-hedging strategy involving both long and short sales was the most popular in America and Britain. But American-based managers were more likely also to trade “event-driven” strategies, based on unexpected occurrences such as takeovers. British-based funds, meanwhile, were more likely to trade in emerging markets and fixed-income.

London funds still rely heavily on American investors. “The U.S. investor side is the broadest, the deepest and the most willing to back new managers and strategies, wherever they may be,” says Tim Spangler, a lawyer who advises hedge funds.

The Brits find the American regulatory to be “bipolar,” the magazine reports. It’s easy to start up a fund, and regulations are fairly relaxed, but when there is a problem, American regulators are vehement in their response. By contrast, British regulations make starting up a hedge fund “sufficiently burdensome to be useful,” said one fund manager there.
