APOLOGY or no apology, Mike Tyson ought to receive not a cent for his fight Saturday in Las Vegas, Nev., against Evander Holyfield, the heavyweight championship bout that some people have mistakenly likened to the Roberto Duran ''no mas'' bout. This was more Shakespearean, as when Marc Antony asks, ''Lend me your ears.'' But Tyson is not one to ask for anything. He takes. Ask Desiree Washington, whose rape accusation eventually sent Tyson to prison for three years.

In a live televised statement yesterday, Tyson said that he had ''snapped'' when he bit Holyfield's ears and drew a disqualification. ''It was the worst night of my professional career,'' he said, and added, ''I apologize'' to the world, his family, the Nevada State Athletic Commission, among others.

He said he did what other athletes have done and has ''paid the price.'' And he mentioned, for one, the ballplayer who spit into the face of an umpire. But no one in memory has chewed off part of an opponent's ear.

Officials of the Nevada State Athletic Commission will today make a recommendation on whether to suspend Tyson or give him a life sentence from boxing in their state as well as whether to fine him. Tyson, in effect, was seeking leniency in his apology. And because he has shown remorse, leniency should be considered.
