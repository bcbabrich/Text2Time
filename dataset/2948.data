The economy of Hong Kong continued to stagnate in the first quarter, with output falling nine-tenths of a percent from a year earlier, near the low end of economists' expectations. A small increase in exports of services, notably a big jump in tourists from mainland China, failed to offset record unemployment of 7 percent and sinking exports of goods. But the economy fared slightly better than it did in the fourth quarter, when output shrank 1.4 percent compared with a year earlier.
