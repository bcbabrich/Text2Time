VOORHEES, N.J. — To really irritate Ian Laperriere, the assistant coach in charge of the Philadelphia Flyers’ penalty-killing unit, all a player needs to do is avoid an opponent’s slap shot. The Flyers know Laperriere certainly never did that when he played hockey.

Laperriere, whom everyone calls Lappy, was hit in the face with flying pucks, too — twice in one fateful season. The second slap shot, launched by Devils defenseman Paul Martin in April 2010, ultimately led to Laperriere’s retirement in June 2012.

“Any player who’s willing to put his face in front of a slapper, you’ve got to respect what he’s saying,” said Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, a veteran forward who kills penalties for the Flyers. “When Lappy tells you something, he’s not telling you something to mess around.”

Laperriere still remembers everything about being hit by Martin’s shot — the dive to block it, the impact, the ringing in his ears, the lost vision in his right eye. He even remembers the first thing he said to the Flyers’ trainer when he came out to attend to him.
