Eastern Air Lines Inc., reeling from an industrywide fare war, reported yesterday a second-quarter loss of $44 million, compared with a profit of $25.5 million, or 37 cents a share, for the corresponding period a year ago.

Eastern's revenues declined 15.4 percent, to $1.1 billion, from $1.3 billion.

Wall Street had been expecting bad news from Eastern, whose chairman, Frank Borman, resigned on June 30.

Joseph B. Leonard, Eastern's president, attributed its poor performance to the combination of industry fare discounting and remaining fallout from union threats against the company earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the Texas Air

Corporation, which had agreed to buy Eastern in a $676 million deal that is pending before the Transportation Department, reported that it had a second-quarter loss of $44.8 million, compared with net income of $41 million, or $2.69 a share, a year ago. Revenues rose 9 percent, to $539.6 million, from $495.1 million.
