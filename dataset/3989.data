Allen Iverson is expected to disclose his National Basketball Association plans on Wednesday, and the Georgetown star is likely to become the first player in Coach John Thompson's 24 years to leave early for the pros.

Iverson has two years of eligibility remaining. The university would not confirm his intentions, saying only that a news conference will be held "regarding Allen Iverson."

Iverson has been driving a $130,000 Mercedes on loan from an auto dealer since early April, an apparent violation of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules that would come into play should he decide to return.

Three weeks ago, The Washington Post quoted unidentified sources as saying the all-America guard had decided to turn pro.
