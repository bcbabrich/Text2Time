But first many experienced periods of unemployment or working at nonprofessional jobs, such as clerking in an office or being a salesman in a store.

Memories Still Linger

The years, however, have not erased their bitterness or memories of their “humilia tion and degradation,” as one dismissed teacher put it.

Even now, two of them said, the receipt of an inno cent letter in an envelope bearing no return name and address brings back memories of the many anonymous hate letters they received after they were dismissed.

Most of the teachers are reluctant today to be identi fied by name. The five who were willing yesterday to be interviewed and identified were reluctant to have their employers named or their home addresses given. One asked that her husband's name not be used because “it might cause him trouble.”

Not all managed to over come the circumstances of their dismissal:

“There were many wrecked lives,” said Dorothy Bloch, a dismissed teacher who is now a certified psychologist and a psychoanalyst in private practice.

If the former teachers were reinstated, they would be come eligible for retirement credit for all of their serv ice in the system prior to their discharge. They would first have to serve a term as substitute teachers before being restored to regular teaching status at the salary steps they were on at the time of their dismissal. School salaries today are about two and a half times what they were when the 31 were dismissed.

As a condition to re‐em ployment, they would be re quired to waive all claims for back salary, retirement credit and other benefits for the period from their discharge to reinstatement.
