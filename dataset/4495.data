Under the new initiative, registered homosexual and unmarried heterosexual couples are granted the same standing as married couples in qualifying for apartments and in inheriting leases in residential buildings overseen by city housing agencies. They also receive the same visiting rights at city jails and hospitals. Those who work for the city may also take unpaid leave to care for newborn children. But the health benefits offered spouses of city workers are not granted to live-in partners, a benefit that the Mayor promised gay voters in his 1989 campaign.

While the registration program has come under criticism for carrying little weight on practical issues like health coverage, city officials call the program, which was created by an executive order issued in January, a significant step. Though there are no precise figures on the number of people covered by the order, everyone recognizes that many New Yorkers live in nontraditional arrangements.

"It's a major statement about the legitimacy of these families in our society," said Dennis deLeon, the Commissioner of Human Rights. 'A Binding Agreement'

"It means something," said Arlene Kochman, executive director of Senior Action in a Gay Environment in Manhattan. "The more people who say, 'We are domestic partners and we have this piece of paper,' the more it will begin to be known that this is a binding agreement and it will be respected."

But for Ellen Carton and Diane D'Alessandro, the certificate recognizing their commitment is a reminder that public acceptance of their seven-year relationship remains an elusive goal.

The couple's certificate is tucked in a manila envelope in the kitchen, nearby so that it can be easily found in the tidy clutter of their Greenwich Village apartment. The certificate has not left its envelope. It is next to their living will and other documents they have prepared for their own legal and financial protection.

"We can still be discriminated against in a way that married couples aren't, in terms of health benefits, in terms of tax returns, not to mention that our relationship is not validated by society," said Ms. Carton, 35, who directs the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in New York.
