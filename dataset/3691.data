To the Editor:

In ''The Picture of Bill Clinton'' (editorial, Aug. 23) you state that President Clinton has not harmed respect for the Presidency because Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan had demonstrated that even the failures of Richard Nixon had not done permanent damage to the office of the President. Very obviously omitted from that list of Presidents since Nixon was President Bush.

George Bush brought honor, dignity and respect to the office of the Presidency, in the eyes of the American people and the world at large. I believe you owe your readers an apology and a correction for an editorial that has a glaring omission and could create an erroneous impression.
