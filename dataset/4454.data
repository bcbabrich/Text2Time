To the Editor:

Your description of child care on the night shift (front page, March 14) is one more example of the lengths parents are forced to go to in order to support their families.

The Toyota Center is certainly a better alternative than many parents have. Without it, the workers you describe would be forced to quit their jobs, leave their children home alone or patch together a series of arrangements, with the constant worry over whether or not their children are safe and well cared for.

Shift work doesn't put undue stress only on children. Shift workers experience higher rates of on-the-job injuries and stress-related illnesses. It's time to look for ways to strike a better balance. In many European countries, round-the-clock production is restricted to industries that require continuous operations, such as oil refining and chemical production.

Rather than continue to organize work as we have always done, and simply add child-care centers to the benefits, let's ask whether or not there's a better, more family-friendly way to protect production and families at the same time. At least, overtime should be voluntary, and parents who can't work the night shift should be able to bid for day jobs that open up.
