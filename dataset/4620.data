Someday soon, the Yankees will have a healthy bunch of players. Danny Tartabull, Mike Gallego, Pat Kelly and Don Mattingly, the latest casualty, will all be ready to play. At least the Yankees think so.

Mattingly, who missed Wednesday night's game, could return as early as tomorrow. The Yankees said Mattingly has tendinitis in the little finger on his right hand, and Mattingly said doctors told him he has carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder, in his fingers. He will be examined by a hand specialist today. The ailment has bothered Mattingly since the spring, and his expectations of playing this weekend could be optimistic.

If there are no other injuries, there will eventually be questions about playing time. Since Buck Showalter is an equal opportunity manager, he has spent hours wrestling with various lineups. Though Showalter will not reveal most of his ideas, there can be situations that will be quite intriguing. Pondering the Possibilities

The manager has pondered just about every possibility. He has even bandied about the idea of playing Mattingly in left field. The Don Mattingly who has already won six Gold Glove awards and is perhaps the best defensive first baseman in baseball. It would allow the Yanks to keep Kevin Maas in the lineup if Tartabull comes back as a designated hitter. But Showalter insists it is only a possibility.
