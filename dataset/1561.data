If you were one of those children who read Roald Dahl’s “James and the Giant Peach” and thought the idea of living inside the giant stone fruit sounded swell, you really ought to get yourself a jar or two, or 14, of Dry Creek Peach jam.

You might not be able to get 14, though. They’re not made in bulk — production is limited by the season’s crop — and the goods go fast.

These jars are a byproduct of the farming done on a modest orchard in Healdsburg, Calif. The property lies in the northernmost part of Dry Creek Valley, on that patch of the verdant floor closest to Sonoma.

A decade ago, a year after her son was born, Gayle Okumura Sullivan figured it was time to find the country home she and her husband, Brian Sullivan, had been casually seeking. She knew she wanted to work with land — impressive when you consider the fact that she, a high-tech marketing operative, and her spouse, a finance guy, “had no growing experience,” she says. The plan was to find a vacant property and “just decide what we wanted to grow.” What they stumbled upon was a peach-dominant farm with a few other conventional products here and there.

The Sullivans honed in on the peaches, which were the property’s largest crop and its only organic one. “When we purchased the farm,” Okumura Sullivan says, “it was the only remaining peach orchard in Sonoma County, and most people expected we would replace it with grapes.”

Soon the Sullivans had an entirely organic orchard devoted to stone fruit, almost all of it peaches. Now, with fewer than 1,000 trees, Dry Creek Peach generates an average of 40 tons of fruit per year, some of which goes to eateries like Chez Panisse, Cyrus and Downtown Bakery, and to specialty markets like Bi-Rite; you can also find them at area Whole Foods Markets. One portion of the harvest is sold on the premises, at the orchard’s farmstand, and another at Sonoma County farmers’ markets.

That leaves a minimal percentage for canning. The number of jars depends on volume and resources. The Sullivans plant 30 varieties of peach, white and yellow, and Okumura Sullivan makes single-strain batches of at least a dozen. In order of annual appearance, these include the Red Haven, “a classic peach that’s almost old-fashioned”; the Suncrest — “it’s nice and bright”; as of last week, the Zee Lady — “a dark-skinned peach that has a dark interior and really incredible, strong flavor”; the Fair Time — “a traditional yellow peach”; the Autumn Flame — “it looks like its name”; and, in the final row, the Last Chance — “it’s beautiful.” Those are merely the yellow options. Of this year’s jarred white alternatives, the Snow King and Yukon King creations, she says, are very delicate, like the fruit, “because most white peaches are sub-acid; the tartness does not exist, making a floral and gentle jam.”

Each type only lasts for a couple of weeks, and the bulk usually arrives in September, although things are running late this year. Okumura Sullivan starts canning and selling her wares immediately. “Everyone else is doing combinations with basil and pineapple,” she says. “I want to keep it to what we do and grow well. It makes a really nice, pure little product.”

Pure? Yes. Little? Not quite. Big flavor is packed into every glass vessel; each one is redolent of the peach that made it. Whereas most peach preserves are watery or bland, these are the exceptions; they’re the reincarnation of summer’s end, and if you pace yourself, you can enjoy them all year ‘round.

It starts at the source. “We let our fruit hang on the tree as long as is physically possible,” Okumura Sullivan says. Then there’s the formula: “It’s a combination of the fruit and sugar. That’s what preserves is as opposed to fruit spread.” While other jams tend to favor the sugar, she uses a lot of fruit, and she tries to avoid pectin.

Some things to do with the jam: Okumura Sullivan, who worked under the pastry chef Christine Law at Postrio back in the day, applies a coat of the peachy spread to her dough as a base for the fresh peaches that fill her galette. (She offers a recipe for it on her Web site.) For a quick chutney, she pan-fries sweet Walla Walla onions and throws the jam on top; it’s a condiment intended for grilled pork or steak.

Looking for a lunchbox special? Here’s a preparation that doesn’t require any cooking at all: the AB&J. Split a baguette and slather it with equal parts almond butter and some of the Dry Creek Peach jam. Give it a try on a rainy day when that first autumn chill creeps in.

Or eat it now. If you can get your hands on a jar of Okumura Sullivan’s Santa Rosa plum jam, eat that, too, with a mild goat cheese.
