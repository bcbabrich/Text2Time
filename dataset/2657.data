WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 - Not quite halfway into the debate on Thursday night, answering a question about the lessons of Iraq, President Bush repeated a line he uses so often on the campaign trail to justify his decision to invade: "The enemy attacked us," he said, and "we would rue the day" if the United States left Saddam Hussein in power.

Senator John Kerry was waiting for that moment. "Saddam Hussein didn't attack us," Mr. Kerry shot back. "Osama bin Laden attacked us." Mr. Bush, he said, had strengthened Al Qaeda with a war in Iraq that was a "diversion" in the broader war on terrorism.

With that exchange, the two men crystallized an argument that has bubbled along for months now, an argument over whether toppling Saddam Hussein was the right course or the wrong one for a nation suddenly confronted with a set of threats that were never aired during the last presidential campaign. It captured, in a moment of head-to-head clarity rarely seen in this campaign so far, the starkly different ways the Vietnam veteran and the sitting commander in chief view the question of when diplomacy has been exhausted, and how to focus the resources of a superpower that, for all its strength, cannot deploy its armies on every potential battlefield.

On everything from the question of whether the coalition that Mr. Bush put together to attack Iraq was truly a global alliance for a global war on terrorism or a Potemkin coalition of convenience, to whether Mr. Bush deserved credit for breaking up the world's most dangerous network of nuclear salesmen or has left bomb material lying around for terrorists to seize, the two men chose their facts to bolster their arguments for taking very different roads. Along the way, each rewrote recent history a bit.
