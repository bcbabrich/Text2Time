Well, it looks like Congress is going to stop this flag desecration that's been going on. Going on somewhere. Not sure where anymore.

Went on all the time everywhere, though, back in Vietnam War days. At least everywhere a television camera caught an anti-war demonstrator in its view finder.

Congress is going to fix that.

Next time there's a Vietnam War there's going to be none of that burning the flag, none of that sewing the flag on the seat of your pants and sitting on it.

Congress is going to amend the Constitution to stop it. That's right: the Constitution Itself. The Big Parchment. Going to amend it.
