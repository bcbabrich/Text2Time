Although it's been a state since 1788, Connecticut has no official song, and this peeves Gov. Thomas J. Meskill. He said he's sick and tired of hearing “Boola Boola” played when he's introduced at out‐of‐state functions, as though it were the state's official song.

There's no lack of musical talent in Connecticut, Mr. Meskill said, noting that Leroy Anderson, Hugo Winterhalter and several other composers have homes there.

I'm tired of running.” Mr. Hamlin, who created the comic strip featuring Oop, Oola, Foozy, and Dinny the Dino saur 37 years ago, said that although he was stepping aside, the strip would continue, with a young Sarasota artist, David Graue, behind the drawing board. “I don't think anybody will notice any difference in Oop,” Mr. Hamlin said.

Lieut. Gov. Lester Maddox of Georgia wanted to clear up the matter at once, and so he wired former President Johnson: “News reports quote you as saying that you will support the Democratic nominee for President in 1972, regardless of who the nominee may be. If Lester Maddox should gain the nomination, would you still honor the pledge? Your early response to my question would be appreciated.” The telegram was sent to the former President's ranch at Johnson City, Tex. In reply, there was a deadly silence from the banks of the
