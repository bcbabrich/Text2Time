ALBANY — It was not even 11 a.m., but the day already looked lost for Gartrell Johnson.

On Sunday, the first day of Giants training camp, Johnson was struggling to complete a conditioning test.

Johnson, a second-year running back, eventually did finish, bringing up the rear, but that was the closest thing to an incident as the Giants kicked off their season.

“Rigor mortis,” Coach Tom Coughlin said of Johnson’s struggles.

Otherwise, Coughlin said, it was a great way to open camp. There were no injuries and none of the players were overweight.

“We have an entire team where no one is overweight,” Coughlin said. “All the big guys. I can’t remember being with a team where all the big guys made it. They all made it.”

On the injury front, Ahmad Bradshaw (feet and ankle) and Keith Bulluck (knee) did not participate in the conditioning test in the morning, but practiced in the evening.

Kenny Phillips (knee) and Kevin Boothe (pectoral) were on the physically unable to perform list.

But perhaps the Giants will be adding another player to the list: Johnson (rigor mortis).
