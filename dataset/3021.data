In the world of important art institutions, nothing is quite as flattering as one acting as showcase for another. Having paid the Kimbell Collection in Fort Worth that tribute some years ago, the Frick Collection has now selected the Toledo Museum of Art, in Ohio, for the honor, mounting a small but weighty exhibition titled ''Masterpieces of European Painting From the Toledo Museum of Art.''

The idea, says Samuel Sachs II, director of the Frick, is to expose its audience to works from museums a little off the beaten path, a generous gesture not to be sneezed at even by culturally mobile New Yorkers. There are just 12 paintings in the show, but they are indeed masterworks and in some ways they complement the Frick's own collection.

What's more, Toledo's story, which begins with its founding in 1901 under the leadership of the glass manufacturer Edward Drummond Libbey and his wife, Florence Scott Libbey, in some ways parallels that of the Frick, which was also set up by an industrial magnate, Henry Clay Frick. Both men collected European masterworks, although Frick turned away from mythological and religious subjects and had little interest in art of his own era.

At his death, in 1919, Frick left his Fifth Avenue mansion and his collection, together with a $15 million endowment, to establish a museum for the public. When Libbey died, in 1925, his entire estate went to the museum, with half the income from the endowment to be used for further acquisitions. (His wife left her own bequest in 1938.) With one exception, all of the paintings in this show were purchased with the Edward Libbey endowment.
