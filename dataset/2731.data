It has been more than two years since a federal appeals court ruled that Wilbert Rideau had to be set free or retried for shooting three people during a 1961 robbery and then cutting the throat of a woman as she tried to crawl away.

In that time, the district attorney here has engineered the selection of a white judge to retry the case, won the disqualification of the black judge who replaced him, and fought to keep the case before a third judge who had worked in the district attorney's office for 11 years. Mr. Rideau is black and his victims were white.

Forty-two years after the crime, the district attorney, Rick Bryant, is determined to convict Mr. Rideau for a fourth time and ensure that the key to his freedom is thrown away for good. Today, the third judge was disqualified for conflict of interest, and Mr. Bryant immediately moved to appeal.

The defense is equally hard-nosed in arguing that Mr. Rideau has paid his debt to society fully, if not fourfold, considering that until the 1970's people sentenced to life in Louisiana were often paroled after 10 or 15 years. Mr. Rideau -- who is technically in pretrial detention and was even eligible to vote in last fall's elections -- has still not tasted a day of liberty.
