It’s always been easy to admire Susan Choi’s novels, especially “American Woman” (2003), loosely based on the Patty Hearst kidnapping and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in fiction. It’s been harder to love them. She’s so poised on the page, so reserved, that distance can slip between teller and tale.

Choi’s new novel, her fifth, is titled “Trust Exercise,” and it burns more brightly than anything she’s yet written. This psychologically acute novel enlists your heart as well as your mind. Zing will go certain taut strings in your chest.

They did in mine, at any rate. Perhaps this is because “Trust Exercise” is a densely imagined high school novel and, like most of her central characters, I graduated from high school in the early 1980s. Choi gets the details right: the mix tapes, the perms, the smokers’ courtyards, the “Cats” sweatshirts, the clove cigarettes, the ballet flats worn with jeans, the screenings of “Rocky Horror,” the clinking bottles of Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers.

These things do not explain this novel’s appeal. “Trust Exercise” is set at a performing arts high school in a large Southern city (it appears to be Houston), yet it is hardly a chicken-fried “Fame.”
