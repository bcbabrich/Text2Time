New York, on the evidence of ''New York Stories,'' is a place of magical coincidences, a place where the most daring dreams of wealth, ambition and psychic well-being can come true. It's a place shaped by success, which can take many forms. It is, for instance, the kind of place where Woody Allen, Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese might join forces to make a film together, simply because they are Woody Allen, Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese.

Each of them has contributed a short film to ''New York Stories,'' and each of the films in some way presents its director's vision of this city's unlimited possibilities. For Mr. Scorsese, whose ''Life Lessons'' is about the way an artist's work and his obsessive love affair commingle, the romance of New York springs from its boundless capacity for fostering creativity and rebirth. For Mr. Coppola, whose ''Life Without Zoe'' is about a latter-day little Eloise who bestows chocolate kisses on a homeless man and considers this a marvelous gesture, the city's glamor is rendered in terms of empty glitter.

And for Mr. Allen, whose ''Oedipus Wrecks'' is the delight of this collection, New York's amazing openness is its salient quality. Mr. Allen's New York is a place where, if one's mother were up in the sky above Columbus Avenue telling embarrassing stories to everyone who could hear her, the people on the street would be happy to answer.

''Oedipus Wrecks,'' the last of the three films and the one most worth waiting for, features Mr. Allen as a lawyer named Sheldon Mills who still has a lot to fear from his mother. She (Mae Questel, who nags with great style) is the type of woman who might just show up in her son's office unannounced, waving the program from ''Cats'' and saying loudly of one of Sheldon's partners, ''This is Bates, the one with the mistress.'' She's a mother who tells her son's fiancee (Mia Farrow), ''You know, his father, may he rest in peace, was completely bald, too.'' When Sheldon objects that he isn't bald, his mother insists, ''You will be.''
