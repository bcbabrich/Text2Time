So, this is how it is done.

It took the Jets less than three hours today to accomplish what they had done once in the last 642 days -- win a football game in the regular season.

And quite a season opener it was, for the team and for its new head coach, Bill Parcells. In trouncing the Seahawks by 41-3, the Jets put together a quality performance they had not demonstrated since a tantalizing stretch with some outstanding teams in the mid-1980's.

Indeed, they had scored this many points on opening day just twice before and had never won their opening game so decisively. Quarterback Neil O'Donnell was near tears as he held a football and described for his brother and sister-in-law, who had a stillborn baby last week, how he was ''bringing this one home for you.''

O'Donnell threw for a career-high five touchdowns -- two each to Wayne Chrebet and Jeff Graham, one for good measure to Kyle Brady -- and in a commanding performance connected on 18 of 25 passes for 270 yards.
