To the Editor: Not mentioned in ''What's Doing in Palermo'' was a religious site (and sight) that, while not for the faint at heart, is fascinating. In the lower level of the Capuchin monastery, nearly 2,000 bodies, embalmed and preserved in oils and chemicals over the centuries, repose above ground in various stages of decay, fully dressed, down to shoes and hats.

The monks wanted people to see what happens after death so that the faithful would behave in life. It is truly haunting.

As advised in the article, we discussed the fare with our taxi driver before entering his cab, and he told us he would deposit us and wait, making a round trip. When we demurred, saying the cost would be prohibitive because he would be kept waiting a long time, he assured us it would be O.K. Expert that he was, he knew we would not be ''sightseeing'' in that gruesome place for too long. He was right. We stayed for less than 10 minutes.JUNE OLIANSKY Brooklyn
