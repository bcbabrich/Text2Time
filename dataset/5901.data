When the Yankees visit Baltimore, they enjoy getting their fill of crabcakes, but when the Orioles visited New York this week, they did not enjoy getting their fill of Butch Wynegar.

On Monday night, Wynegar stroked a two-out single against Tim Stoddard in the 11th inning that gave the Yankees a 4-3 victory over the Orioles. Last night Wynegar socked a two-out home run against Stoddard in the 12th inning that gave the Yankees another 4-3 victory over the Orioles.

The latest victory gave the Yankees a sweep of their three games with Baltimore and 10 victories in their last 13 games. They also climbed six games above .500 for the first time this season. The Orioles, on the other hand, have lost six of their last seven games and have fallen two games behind the first-place Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East. The Yankees are a half-game behind the Orioles.

''It's always a thrill for me to hit a home run because I don't hit too many of them,'' said Wynegar, whose two-run homer completed the 7-0 victory over Baltimore Wednesday night. ''But when you're with a team like this and you know you have a good chance of going all the way, it has all the more impact on you.''
