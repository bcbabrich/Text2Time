''Now, it's all about a legacy for this team and for Kareem,'' Riley said. ''That's the only thing left for them at this point. Once he leaves there'll be a new, fresh challenge. Another ring? That's not enough. When I asked them who they thought the greatest team ever was, the only team out of their lips was Boston. Every time anyone looks at Russell, all they think of is the respect he achieves through his association with that team. These guys have a chance to attain that same kind of respect.''

In fact, the Lakers are well stocked and well prepared to defend their title, perhaps more so than any champion in the last 18 seasons. But talent and preparation, as many of their predecessors have proved, do not assure any team of repeating. Other factors conspire to undermine the champion's resolve. Jealousy? If this was to have afflicted the Lakers, it would have done so last season when Riley passed the torch of leadership from Abdul-Jabbar to Johnson. With that torch came a season in which Johnson took more shots and scored more points than he had in any of his seven previous seasons, and won the most valuable player award for the first time. Rather than resist what was a drastic change, the Lakers, including Abdul-Jabbar, seemed inspired by it.

Byron Scott, James Worthy, Michael Cooper and even Abdul-Jabbar all either had what Riley calls ''career seasons'' or surpassed their achievements of the previous season.

''I think everybody has taken their game to a higher level,'' said Scott, the Lakers' other guard. ''We all still take our cues from Magic. It's worked so far.''

This season, Johnson and his lucrative smile dominate the cover of the team's media guide, clutching the golden championship trophy behind smaller images of Abdul-Jabbar, Cooper, Worthy and Riley. So far, copies of the book have not been passed around the locker room. Greed? It often happens that teams are weakened by the desire of players to cash in on their championship seasons, or the feeling by management that it must make personnel changes in order to avoid stagnation. Either the team loses one or more players through free agency or it executes a trade, or players press for renegotiation of their contracts, all of which tinker with the championship team's already-delicate balance. For example, in the year following the Seattle Supersonics' championship season in 1979, tensions between starting guards, Dennis Johnson and Gus Williams - primarily over money - and their coach, Lenny Wilkens, began a long decline for that team.

On Friday evening at the Forum, perhaps all but one of the 12 players who were members of the championship team will be present to receive their rings. Adrian Branch, a bit player, is on the verge of losing his place on the roster to Milt Wagner, the former Louisville guard, or Jeff Lamp, formerly of Virginia.

And the only player who has crowed for a raise is Johnson, who is unhappy with his $1 million salary (even with $1.5 million in deferred money starting in 1994), which is about $2.5 million less than what Abdul-Jabbar earns. Jerry Buss, the team owner, will probably settle the issue before it becomes a problem. Injuries? This is the one area over which no one has control, and it is already beginning to have an effect. Johnson played in only three games during the exhibition season because of tendinitis in his left ankle, a condition that will require him to wear a specially constructed shoe and perhaps undergo regular treatment. And last week, Worthy suffered a sprained ankle in an exhibition game against the Nets. It was not diagnosed as being severe, although Worthy has missed two games.
