Faiyazuddin Dagar, a singer whose family has been performing its own tradition of Hindu classical music for 19 generations - since the 15th century - died of a heart attack Feb. 7 in New Delhi. He was 55 years old.

Mr. Dagar and his brother, Zahiruddin, had toured the world singing in a style of dhrupad, an ancient devotional form of raga, named Dagarbani after the family. In Dagarbani style, the two brothers sang in overlapping, conversational phrases; one of the oldest surviving Indian classical traditions, drhupad is both meditative and virtuosic. The Dagar brothers were widely praised for their control and concentration.

The Dagar brothers were born in Indore in the state of Madhya Pradesh, and studied with their father and their elder brothers, Aminuddin and Mahinuddin Dagar, for 20 years before performing in public.

Mr. Dagar is survived by his wife, four daughters, a son and two brothers.
