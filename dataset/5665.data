The Interior Department today canceled the second part of a scheduled sale of oil leases off New England, citing lack of industry interest and a court decision that placed much of the area under Canadian jurisdiction.

The first part of the sale, which included the Georges Bank fishing ground, was canceled in September after no bids were received for the available tracts except for those submitted by Greenpeace, a conservation group that opposed the sale.

The department also announced that it would defer setting a date for still another sale of offshore oil leases in the area until a new five-year plan for the development of the outer continental shelf was completed.

That plan would succeed the current five-year program put into effect by James G. Watt when he was the Secretary of the Interior. That program, which made virtually the entire billion- acre Atlantic, Pacific and Alaskan coasts available to bidding by oil companies, was attacked by conservationists and officials of coastal states who said it did not pay sufficient heed to the coastal environment and coastal economies.
