A uniformed officer stood guard over construction workers repairing the sidewalk outside the Chapel Square Mall. Other police officers patrolled inside the mall. Still more patrolled the parking garage underneath.

The officers were all members of the New Haven police force. But they were working in their off-duty hours. The mall reimbursed the city for their services and the officers earned an average of $1 an hour above their regular hourly pay.

The officers were among 150 members of the 350-member police force who regularly spend their off-duty hours guarding malls and housing developments, construction sites and rock concerts, supermarkets and department stores.

Last year, these off-duty officers earned a total of $1.4 million for these additional duties. The top off-duty wage earner grossed $26,500, about as much as he earned in his regular police job. In addition, the city earned $70,000 in 5 percent surcharges for its role in handling the extra-duty requests and assigning the police officers.
