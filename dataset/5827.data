White House aides acknowledged that the most stinging criticism of the commission, which was headed by Adm. Robert L.J. Long, retired, was aimed at the whole idea that the marines' presence in Beirut could by itself shore up the beleaguered pro-Western Government of President Amin Gemayel. The commission urged, in fact, ''a re-examination of alternative means of achieving U.S. objectives in Lebanon,'' including ''a more vigorous and demanding approach to pursuing diplomatic alternatives.''

To minimize damage from the commission's criticism, Mr. Reagan held a news conference before the report was released and, in effect, pre-empted the commission's findings with his own assessment of the situation. In addition, the White House prevailed on the Pentagon to cancel a briefing on the report to avoid having the military repeat its criticisms.

For some time, White House aides have acknowledged that military leaders were uncomfortable with Mr. Reagan's widening of the American military role in the Middle East, as well as in Central America, in the absence of adequate public support. The Long commission concluded that the American military's siding with the Lebanese Army against Druse and Moslem Shiite forces marked a fundamental shift from the marines' original role. They had been sent to Lebanon as an ''evenhanded and neutral'' force in the country's civil conflicts, the Long Commission said, and once this role was left behind, there was a general failure to change the rules of engagement. (Reagan's changing explanations, page 4.) Senior Administration officials acknowledge that the marines remain in Lebanon largely because withdrawing them would lead swiftly to withdrawal by French, Italian and British forces, and that would lead to ''chaos'' as the Lebanese Army fought with its Shiite and Druse foes for the territory left behind.

To some at the White House, the most compelling reason why Mr. Reagan had to accept responsibility for the deaths of the marines was that he had made the decision to change the nature of their role after sending them in the first place.

Among Mr. Reagan's advisers, then, the main concern about the Long commission was not the casting of blame but whether there would be new impetus for Congress and the public to question the principle of committing American forces to support the Gemayel Government. Some in the Administration agreed that the report would reinforce demands on Capitol Hill that Mr. Reagan do more to force Mr. Gemayel to negotiate to achieve a government of ''national reconciliation.'' Mr. Reagan, by rushing to accept blame for the deaths of the marines, may have put the issue of culpability behind him even while opening up the debate over his policies.
