Although the European Community has acted to ban imports of beef from cattle treated with growth-stimulating hormones, most experts in the United States insist that when the hormones are properly applied, the beef is safe to eat.

But some consumer advocates say the hormones are not always properly used. They tell of an investigation by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1986 indicating that some feed lot operators gave animals too much hormone or implanted it in the animals' bodies where it did not belong.

The Agriculture Department says that it has stepped up enforcement since then and that misuse of hormones is now rare. But the consumer advocates are advising shoppers to look for beef from cattle not treated with the hormones. Hormone-Free Products
