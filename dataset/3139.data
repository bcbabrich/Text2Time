A sense of Thompson's own history is all the more necessary because prevailing interpretations of the British past have shifted with disorienting speed in the past 20 years or so. When Thompson began his work in the late 1940's, in a Britain marked by profound social and political antagonisms, Whig historians and Marxists alike tended to portray British history as a story of unending conflict. For the Historians' Group of the English Communist Party, which included Edward and Dorothy Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm and Christopher Hill, the central episodes were the 17th-century civil war (they called it the ''English Revolution'') and the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. The one supposedly heralded the ascendancy of the bourgeoisie, the other the rise of the working class, and both pointed the way to the longed-for triumph of socialism.

This perspective infused Thompson's early work on Morris, and he later regretted that he had allowed ''some hectoring political moralisms, as well as a few Stalinist pieties, to intrude upon the text.'' These moralisms and pieties did not survive the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolt of 1956, and by the time he wrote ''The Making of the English Working Class'' (which began as the first chapter of a history of the English labor movement, but swelled to 848 pages), he had broken both with the Communist Party and with orthodox Marxism. But his sense of history as struggle had only intensified, for he had now come to his notion of a working class that had actively and heroically ''made itself,'' and that moreover had come ''within an ace'' of starting a proto-socialist revolution in the early 1830's. The failure of that revolution, supposedly in the face of concerted repression, gave the book a tragic tinge that only intensified its political appeal.

A vision of British history as continuous conflict remained dominant through the 1970's, in large part thanks to ''The Making of the English Working Class.'' But today, in Tony Blair's Britain, the past looks very different. Leading British historians like John Brewer and Linda Colley write not about early class struggles, but about the early vigor and dynamism of the British state and British culture, and about the people's patriotic support for the government against France. Colley presented her book ''Britons,'' which focuses on the same historical period covered by ''The Making of the English Working Class,'' as ''an attempt to rescue . . . the seeming conformists from the condescension of posterity,'' leaving no doubt which condescending nonconformist historian she had in mind. To the extent that the new prevailing interpretations highlight conflict, it is no longer class conflict, but rather ethnic conflict between the constituent nations of Britain (the English Civil War now sometimes goes by the title of ''the War of the Three Kingdoms''), and religious conflict. The most important period in the story now appears to be less the age of Cromwell or the Industrial Revolution than the 18th century, once derided for its supposed complacency and corruption, but now heralded as the moment when Britain consolidated itself and rose to world dominance.

In this new climate, it sometimes seems as if E. P. Thompson has altogether disappeared under a scrum of his critics. It is pointed out acerbically that the 18th-century legal system was less draconian and repressive in practice than he thought. It is argued that religious dissent, rather than emerging class consciousness, guided radical politics before 1832. From among Thompson's own professional and political allies come calls to emphasize race and gender as well as class. It is even charged that Thompson deliberately played down the racism, sexism and anti-Semitism of his radical heroes. And there are those who deconstruct the concept of class altogether, replacing Thompson's saga of working-class heroism with an impersonal tracking of shifts in the language of novels, pamphlets, plays and newspapers.

In truth, there is something to be said for many of these criticisms. It is hard to imagine how the society described in ''The Making of the English Working Class,'' agonizingly divided between repressive patricians and struggling plebeians, could have marshaled the herculean resources necessary to defeat Napoleonic France, let alone laid the foundations of a worldwide empire. The imaginative sympathy this missionary's son usually showed for his subjects tended to evaporate when it came to religion (from ''The Making of the English Working Class'': ''Calvinism was not the same thing as Methodism, although it is difficult to say which, in the early 19th century, was worse''). Although Thompson could display a remarkable feminist sensibility, as for instance in the moving defense of Mary Wollstonecraft included here, his admiration for the radical William Cobbett was undiminished by Cobbett's vicious anti-Semitism and his talk of ''fat and greasy Negroes.'' Thompson's close attention to language and ritual anticipated much of the current ''new cultural history,'' but his notions of working-class consciousness were simplified and exaggerated, and called out for sharper analysis.
