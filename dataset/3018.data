While much of the area around the school looked relatively unscathed, the school itself was reduced to dusty debris and flattened to a fraction of its former size. It looked as if something colossal had crashed down upon it.

Even hours after they began sifting through the debris, rescue workers seemed transfixed by the sight of it and unable to come to terms with what lay beneath it.

One firefighter who stood a few yards from the school, taking a short break, whispered into a cellphone: ''They are children. They are children. They are dead children.''

Ambulances waited along the streets, and endless phalanxes of police officers, their hands linked, formed human chains to keep the streets clear for emergency traffic.

At about 9:15 P.M., the rescue workers suddenly accelerated their pace, and minutes later, several of them rushed to a stretcher with a wriggling boy who residents said was 6 or 7.

As they laid him on a stretcher and wheeled it to an ambulance, Giuseppe Colombo, the school's principal, who had been pacing up and down the street with a frantic look on his face, reached out his hand and brushed the boy's cheek with it.

''How are you?'' he said. ''How are you? They tell me you're going to be fine.''

Mr. Colombo carried a list of all the children who had been at school that day, so he could keep track of who had been found and who had not.
