''As to topics, we discussed the full range of issues and problems that we have,'' he said. ''While we see some progress in some areas, there are some very deep differences.''

With a view to trying to smooth some of the differences in the summit meeting, Mr. Shultz said, they ''tried to put in place a process for working at them and for making preparations for the Geneva meeting.''

''I think that this meeting can well be called a good first step in getting ready to make that meeting a genuinely productive one between our two leaders,'' Mr. Shultz said. 'Inner Compass of His Own'

He said he felt that after the meeting today he and Mr. Shevardnadze ''should have an easy ability to talk to each other in a direct and useful way.''

Americans present at the meeting called Mr. Shevardnadze ''an interesting person, a strong person,'' who is a ''good, strong interlocutor,'' and who has ''an inner compass of his own.''

''He is a very capable person, clearly,'' an official said. ''You can tell that immediately. Even though he is just starting on this job, he has got a good command of things.''

Mr. Shevardnadze's background has been in the internal administration of his native Georgian republic of the Caucasus, one of the non-Slavic states of the Soviet Union. There he headed the Young Communist League in the late 1950's, served as Interior Minister, in charge of the police, from 1965 to 1972, and for the last 13 years, as the Communist Party leader, was in effect the ruler of Georgia.
