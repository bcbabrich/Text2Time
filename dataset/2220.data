Clement Price, a long-time Newark resident, teacher of a course on city history and director of the Rutgers Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience, knows a thing or two about the racial politics of Newark. He is rarely shocked by the angry tone or insults hurled between candidates.

But he said today that the battle over blackness and racial loyalty reached a new low last week with Amiri Baraka’s broadside against the Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council. Mr. Baraka went too far, he said, by suggesting in starkly racial terms that Reverend Jackson was serving white interests by opposing the city’s effort to spend $80 million on redevelopment projects selected by the mayor and his allies.

“Historically in this town, ministers — as you would expect — have enjoyed a kind of stature, and respectability that seemingly has been breached by Amiri’s very strong attack,” Mr. Price said. “This is a real break from tradition.”

Mr. Price said the attack was particularly disconcerting because Reverend Jackson was a vocal critic of the New Jersey State Police when troopers were accused of pulling over more minority drivers than white drivers in the 1990’s.

“He probably makes everyone’s Top 10 list of important African-American figures in the state because of his courageous stand with racial profiling,” Mr. Price said. “Going after the state police is not something most would do.”

He added that he feared that Mr. Baraka’s e-mail could unleash similar attacks in a city facing transition.

“There seems to be this intra-racial discussion among African-Americans about all matters racial,” Mr. Price said. “Reggie Jackson has come out to some extent in support of vouchers. Does that make him white? The answer of course is no, but in Newark, things are often racialized. So, in other words, if you criticize public education, you become tied to Republicans, Cory Booker and whites.”

“It may just be a scary foreboding of what might happen after the election,” he added. “There seems to be this mood of anxiety about a changing city and it’s undermining the traditional ways of the community, from the secular to the sacred.”

Reverend Jackson, for his part, declined to address Mr. Baraka’s attack. “The only comment that I will have is, you are not what people call you,” he said. “You are what you answer to.”
