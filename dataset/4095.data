In the shadowy hallway of a South Bronx apartment building, Maggie V. has posted a message to remind herself of past struggles. Its bold letters read, "Housing is a Human Right." At 30, Ms. V. is a single mother studying to become a social worker. Her goal is to help other women from Puerto Rico, her homeland, find affordable housing and avoid the battles she had to fight not long ago.

She came to New York from Puerto Rico in 1987, and for the first two years she stayed with relatives in a crowded apartment. But in 1988, Ms. V. became pregnant, and her family told her to find new housing. She searched for months, but nothing was affordable. She ended up renting a room in a cheap motel in Queens, where the manager sexually harassed and robbed her.

"If you are a young Puerto Rican woman on your own, they assume you're a prostitute," she said. "I was scared for my life."

In her search for an apartment, Ms. V. heard about a shelter for pregnant women run by Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York. Catholic Charities is one of seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, in its 83d year. The shelter, on Madison Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, provides counseling and medical care for homeless women. Three months pregnant, Ms. V. moved in.
