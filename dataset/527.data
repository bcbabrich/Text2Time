NEWARK — Jurors deliberating the fate of two former aides to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey accused in a bizarre plot to close lanes at the George Washington Bridge sent back three questions on Tuesday hinting that they may be divided.

Lawyers for the defense responded angrily to the judge’s response to one question, arguing that it was a bait and switch on the original charges.

“By answering the way you’re answering, you’re directing a verdict of guilty,” Michael Critchley, a lawyer for Bridget Anne Kelly, told the judge.

The question, on the first full day of jury deliberations after a six-week trial, reflected a heated debate between the prosecution and the defense over just what the defendants are charged with.
