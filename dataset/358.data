Good afternoon! We are on the verge of a weekend of nail-biting anticipation, at least among a certain crowd. This coming Monday evening is the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s annual awards, a.k.a. the Oscars of the U.S. fashion industry. Did you even know it was happening? Get ready: It may have more of an impact on you than you might think.

Over the last few years, the CFDA has been gradually upping the celeb-and-promotional factor of the awards, which (let’s be honest) have in the past had a tendency to feel a bit like a high school prom, only with better clothes. The same designers tend to get nominated for the same awards: For example, this year, four of the five names on the list for homecoming king — sorry, women’s wear designer of the year — have already won, sometimes more than once, and the fifth won the international designer of the year award when he was at another house. Every year I can’t help but think: Get a little imagination, people.

Well, be careful what you wish for. While the same fashion names may be on the roster next week, they are dressed up (pardon the pun) with a lot of big-tent, boldface-name glam, picked to appeal to a pretty broad demographic, including those who may not think that much about designers, but know a lot about movies, politics and late-night TV. Which might possibly include you.
