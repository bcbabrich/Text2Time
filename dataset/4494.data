HE has been called the Infomercial King and the Head Honcho of Hair Replacement. But although thenickname may vary, millions of television viewers hear Sy Sperling of Manhasset declare every night that he is "not only the Hair Club president," but "also a client."

His delivery is just bland enough to convince viewers that he is no actor. His before-and-after demonstration, in which he holds a photograph of his bald head next to a youthful face now framed by thick brown hair, is impressive for the 30 million American men plagued by varying degrees of alopecia, or hair loss.

Mr. Sperling's success is part of a trend for entrepreneurs to take to the airwaves to sell their products. Now Mr. Sperling, who is 52, has turned his advertisement into a 30-minute "infomercial," or paid advertisement. The advertisements and "advertorials" for the Hair Club for Men, are seen 400 times a day on network and cable television at a cost of $12 million this year. But, Mr. Sperling added, that is a small price to pay for a campaign that puts a former swimming-pool salesman from the Bronx at the helm of a $60 million company.

His fame, he said, is a "nice, but incidental" result of an advertising campaign that a Manhattan ad agency, whose name he refuses to disclose, began 11 years ago. "Because of these ads," Mr. Sperling said, "there are a couple of hundred million people who know who I am at this point and who know about my company."
