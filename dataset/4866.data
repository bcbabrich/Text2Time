Pentagon aid to the Soviet Union would be separate from and in addition to other public and private American assistance currently under consideration, including increased agricultural loan guarantees and direct food aid this winter. The total amount of proposed Pentagon aid has not been determined, the officials said.

When the idea was first suggested by Mr. Aspin in August after the unsuccessful hard-line coup in Moscow, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney dismissed it as "foolish" and "a serious mistake" that could damage United States security.

Under gentle prodding from the White House, though, Mr. Cheney is now ready to relent on the condition that the Pentagon has authority to make the necessary budget cuts and to decide how the money will be spent on the Soviets, Administration officials said.

The Soviet aid package is the brainchild of the two influential leaders of the Armed Services Committees, Mr. Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. For the last several weeks, the two men have worked with their staffs and quietly with key Administration officials to draft a proposal acceptable to Congress and the Pentagon.

The lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on the plan, which is included in the military budget bill that House and Senate negotiators are expected to complete in the next few days.

The full House and Senate are expected to approve the compromise bill, which then goes to President Bush. Administration officials said the plan would not violate last year's budget agreement because the Soviet aid would come out of the Pentagon's budget. No Pentagon money could be devoted to domestic programs this year without reopening the budget agreement, a very unlikely possibility.

Lawmakers have suggested that the Pentagon consider a number of steps to assist the Soviet Union, including using Air Force planes to transport food and medical aid to the Soviet people this winter and to provide other help in distributing the aid.
