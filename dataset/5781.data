The man accused of heading the Gambino crime organization went on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday, with the judge telling potential jurors that their identities would be kept secret.

The judge, Kevin Thomas Duffy, opened the trial of Paul Castellano, 69 years old, of Staten Island, who is accused of being the leader, and nine other reputed members of the crime group by assuring potential jurors that the use of an anonymous jury was ''not unusual.''

Under a March 1984 indictment, the defendants are accused of stealing cars, falsly registering and insuring them, and then shipping them for sale in the Middle East, Puerto Rico, Europe and New Jersey. They are also accused of two 1979 murders in Brooklyn in connection with the purported car ring.

Trial for Others Later

The Government plans to try all 10 defendants along with others later on a number of other charges.
