New Jersey's 70,000 daily rail commuters began paying more for their rides today as the State Supreme Court and State Legislature prepared to discuss the controversial fare schedules.

The Supreme Court will meet in Trenton to decide whether opponents of the new fares are entitled to a temporary injunction that had been granted Friday by Superior Court Judge Baruch Seidman and then lifted a few hours later by Supreme Court Justice Sidney M. Schreiber.

The Court will also be asked to conduct a scheduled Dec. 8 hearing on the fare increases.

The hearing was ordered for a three‚Äêjudge appellate court panel by Judge Seidman.

Harold Ruvoldt Jr., the Hudson County Counsel, is leading the court challenge. He said that the fare controversy was certain to reach the state's highest court eventually and that he would ask that it be taken up directly.
