BEYOND UHURA "Star Trek" and Other Memories. By Nichelle Nichols. Putnam, $22.95.

Nichelle Nichols, best known as the communications officer on the Starship Enterprise on "Star Trek," has written a monotonous memoir in "Beyond Uhura." Her narrative begins with her 19th-century ancestors, continues with her Midwestern childhood and concludes with the twilight of her "Star Trek" career. But there is little more here than endless brushes with greatness and repetitious hosannas to her onetime lover, Gene Roddenberry, the producer and creator of "Star Trek." And that's a pity, because to read between the lines of "Beyond Uhura" is to uncover the story of a competent performer entangled in a capricious profession and its exclusionary and often humiliating practices. Ms. Nichols has some good stories to tell, but she fails to engage. TONI L. KAMINS
