The long and bitter litigation over the hit reality series “Project Runway” came to an end Wednesday when the Weinstein Company, which owns the show, agreed to pay NBC Universal a settlement fee, acknowledging it had improperly sold the show to a competitive network without giving NBC a right to match the offer.

Harvey Weinstein, the chief executive of The Weinstein Company, released a statement praising Jeff Zucker, the CEO of NBC Universal.

“I want to personally congratulate Jeff Zucker and NBCU on their success in the litigation and thank Jeff for resolving this in a professional manner,” Mr. Weinstein said.

“Project Runway” has been one of the biggest reality hits on cable while running for five cycles on the Bravo network, which is owned by NBC Universal. The Weinstein Company announced last year that it had sold future editions of the show to the Lifetime Channel, which planned to begin running new episodes of the show last November.

But NBC sued, charging the Lifetime had made an offer that Bravo should have been allowed to try to match. NBC won an injunction in September that prevented Lifetime from putting the show on the channel.

Lifetime announced Wednesday that the Weinstein Company will now pay NBC a fee for the right to move the show to Lifetime.
