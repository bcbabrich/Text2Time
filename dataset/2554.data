The International Accounting Standards Board on Wednesday issued what are supposed to be its final rules before Europe adopts international accounting standards in 2005, but the final shape of an important rule on derivatives, unpopular with many financial institutions, could change.

''We committed that people would know what the accounting would be by the end of March,'' said Thomas Jones, vice chairman of the standards board, which is based in London. ''We are putting the last two pieces out now.''

The two rules announced Wednesday are a revised standard for insurance companies and proposed changes in the rule on accounting for the use of derivatives, whose value depends on that of an underlying security.

In each case, the board made changes aimed at reducing the volatility that will appear in financial statements while still allowing investors a better understanding of how well companies are doing.
