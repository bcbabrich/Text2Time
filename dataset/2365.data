Unfortunately, if nary a false note is struck in the first quarter-hour of Ms. Gionfriddo's play, nary an honest one is heard in the remainder. Both the plotting and dialogue grow increasingly shrill and overstated. Even Justin's character, drawn with such satisfyingly dappled colors in the first scene, turns neon. He becomes a tiresome wiseacre dispensing sarcastic asides (often, admittedly, very funny ones) in rhythms that suggest he has a team of sitcom writers at work behind the scenes.

Ms. Gionfriddo has set out to diagnose social ills, you see, and nuanced characters are not required. Her target is America's taste for blood and its tabloid-tinged, sex-crime-addicted popular media. She also has a few admonishing words for the benighted folks who exploit their own misfortunes in catering to said media's ravening need for new sensations.

Justin is pressed into service as her moral megaphone. Seething at the way his mother's death has been packaged for popular consumption, he's the truth-teller who cuts through the cant and prurience all around him. "I am ready and willing to lead the return to shame movement," he tells Julie (Anna Paquin), the mixed-up college girl he meets at a bar one night. "People on TV are eating bugs, trying to marry millionaires. Shame is an idea whose time has come."

Expounding on his own experience, he adds: "My mother was murdered. I don't know what the aftermath of that is supposed to be, but I don't think it's supposed to be a book and TV show and a rap song and a girl in my room. It's like we've lost the truth of it, we've buried it under all this junk."

Unassailable arguments, these. There will be few in the audience, after all, ready to assert that the grisly death of Laci Peterson was cheated of its due share of air time. But this makes Ms. Gionfriddo's play less an inquiry into ambiguous areas of social thought and feeling than a seminar spelling out widely acknowledged truths.

Some efforts are made to analyze root causes. Julie provides some intellectual verbiage suggesting the aesthetic value of sympathetic suffering, and Alden earnestly prattles on about the "empowerment" his television show provides for female victims. But it's Justin's ringing denunciations - "You're packaging sickness as entertainment" - that are meant to arouse our clucks of sympathy. Yet most in the audience will have done their clucking at these topics some time ago.

Despite some fine work from Ms. Paquin and particularly Mr. Culkin, the director Terry Kinney's production is sabotaged by the conflicting impulses in the writing. Ms. Gionfriddo does not fully embrace the satiric potential in the material, but its cartoonish aspects subvert its power as a poignant drama about a young man's attempt to come to terms with his mother's death.
