Introduced last Thursday: 2011 Kia Optima sedan

Is it real? Yes. Take off the badges and you could mistake the 2011 Kia Optima for a European luxury car.

What they said: Kia should mean more than bargain-prices and a strong warranty, according to Peter Schreyer, Kia’s chief design officer. Speaking directly after the press conference, Mr. Schreyer said the Optima can make Kia a “desirable brand,” while maintaining core values such as affordability and economy.

What they didn’t say: How will Kia stop the stylish new Optima from cannibalizing sales of sister company Hyundai? The Optima shares the same platform and engines as the Hyundai Sonata, which received a similar revamp earlier this year. Toyota and Honda might be the intended targets, but the Korean brands could equally end up stealing sales from each other.

What makes it tick? Three engines are available: a naturally aspirated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, a 2-liter turbocharged 4 and, in early 2011, a hybrid based on the 2.4-liter engine. A 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters are the transmission choices. The fanciest options – like a panoramic sunroof, special black leather trim, and the gorgeous 18-inch alloys seen on the show car at the New York Auto Show – come standard on the sportiest trim level, the Optima SX.

How much? How soon? The Optima, in naturally-aspirated 2.4-liter and 2-liter turbocharged format, arrives this fall. However, the wait for the Optima hybrid stretches into early next year. Pricing (and official m.p.g. figures) will be revealed closer to the launch date.

How does it look? This is one great looking car, plain and simple. Other journalists at the New York auto show compared the exterior to cars from the likes of Saab and Audi.
