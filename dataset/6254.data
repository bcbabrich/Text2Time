The closed hearing tomor row before Judge Hoffman would mark the first time that the 66‐year‐old judge from the Federal District Court at Norfolk, Va., has come here to preside over a confrontation between attorneys for the Vice President and the Justice Department. All nine Federal judges in Baltimore have disqualified themselves from sitting in the case because of past personal or political associations with Mr. Agnew.

In a brief hearing with the opposing lawyers in his Norfolk chambers last Friday, Judge Hoffman formally received Mr. Agnew's petition to bar further presentation of evidence concerning him to the grand jury here. The judge then set a schedule for prehearing briefs and pleadings on the request to stop the inquiry, starting next Friday, with the first full hearing set for Oct. 12.

Mr. Agnew contends that a sitting Vice President cannot constitutionally be indicted and that the allegations against him cannot be given fair consideration by the grand jury because of news leaks and prejudicial publicity about his case.

The sudden, unscheduled proceedings before Judge Hoffman here tomorrow, kept so tightly secret that it could not be officially confirmed anywhere, reportedly was set to receive the request of Mr. Agnew's lawyers for extraordinary court authority to take sworn statements from Government officials believed by them to be the source of leaks to newsmen, and perhaps from newsmen themselves.

Mr. Agnew's lawyers would make no comment tonight on the nature of the hearing. The United States Attorney's office here, whose lawyers are to attend the closed hearing, has maintained a policy of refusing to comment on any grand jury matter.

Parties in civil lawsuits normally have broad authority to take depositions, or sworn statements, from witnesses for both sides as part of the pretrial discovery procedure.

But no such automatic pro cedure exists in criminal cases, and lawyers familiar with the Baltimore investigation said today that they doubted whether Mr. Agnew's lawyers even had the proper legal standing to ask the court to grant such authority.
