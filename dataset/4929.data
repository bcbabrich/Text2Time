To the Editor:

By pointing out that most of the artists and writers in the West, including our own country, failed to support the anti-Communists behind the Iron Curtain before 1989, Joseph A. Bosco's letter [March 18] has provided an excellent corrective to John Russell's assertion that in ''the last 50 years . . . literature and the arts did not let us down'' [''Tyrants Fall; Art Endures,'' Feb. 18] .

To those who would refute Mr. Bosco by arguing that those who can paint, compose music or write novels should not be expected to have a particular role in politics, the answer, I believe, is that Mr. Bosco's criticism is not leveled against those writers and artists who were apolitical but against those, and they are numerous, who see themselves as being equipped by their craftsmanship to ''bear witness'' to the moral conflicts of our age, ''to tell what no one else can tell'' (to use Mr. Russell's words). And it is in this role, by supporting the doctrine of ''moral equivalence'' between East and West, rather than supporting the dissidents who led the democratic revolution now sweeping Europe, that these artists let us down.
