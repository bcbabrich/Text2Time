SOMETIMES the question is not so much what's in a name as it is what's in a place?

The thought was prompted by the local furor in Suffolk County about the name of Shirley, the village on Sunrise Highway Extension near the south end of South Haven Park (Yaphank is at the north end). There are those who would like to change the name of Shirley to Floyd Harbor, and there are those who have vowed that they will never renounce Shirley.

There is no evidence of sexism in the debate between Shirley and Floyd, none of the kind of thing that resulted in the weather people's finally deciding to use male as well as female names when it comes to hurricanes. A community is not a hurricane, although a name change may sometimes indicate which way the wind is blowing.

When Constantinople, which is not on Long Island but in Turkey, became Istanbul, one knew that there had been a change in management, from Greek to Turk. In Northern Ireland, the Irish Catholics call the border city Derry, while those with strong Empire leanings keep it on the map as Londonderry. Jerusalem, the Hebrew and best-known name of the Israeli city, which was in Roman times Aeolia Capitolina, is known to the Arabs as Al-Kuds, the Holy Place.

Suffolk's neighbor to the west, the town of Nieuw Amsterdam, suddenly became New York in 1664, when the British conquerors retired the Dutch founders. The venerable Long Island Historical Society recently changed its name to the Brooklyn Historical Society, in keeping with its Brooklyn Heights location. In early years, Brooklyn, its own city, was widely acknowledged to be on Long Island and, indeed, was the place where Washington's 1776 battle with the British took place.
