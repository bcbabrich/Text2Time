The Feld Ballet will be presenting its first ballet by George Balanchine - the high-spirited ''Tarantella'' - during the company's two-week spring season, which begins Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. And there will be a new work by Carolyn Carlson, the former Alwin Nikolais dancer who currently directs her own dance company in Paris. But for Feld fans, the highlight of the season promises to be the revival of his ''Tzaddik,'' created in 1974 and last seen in New York 10 years ago. Performed to Aaron Copland's ''Vitebsk,'' the dance is one of Eliot Feld's richest works, drawing on the choreographer's memories of the rituals he watched as a child in synagogue.

Daniel McCusker left New York in 1985 to direct the Ram Island Dance Company of Portland, Me. He returns for a rare New York engagement, opening on Friday for three performances at St. Mark's Church. A former member of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company, Mr. McCusker makes pieces that seem to be a matter of luminous abstract dance. But they shimmer with poignant subtexts, conjuring images of lives and the places and times they were lived.

''Vantage Points,'' a new work set to music by David Friedman, doesn't sound like an exception. The program will be completed by ''Story,'' an atmospheric dance with a breakneck solo for the choreographer.

Pina Bausch will likely always be a controversial figure in American dance. For those who wish to add a little light to the heat, there is a slide-lecture, ''An Exploration of the New Esthetic: The Magnetic German Tanztheater,'' presented by Claudia Jeschke. Highlights and current trends in German neo-Expressionist theater and dance will be explored in the free lecture, sponsored by Goethe House New York and the Dance Collection Performing Arts Research Collection, Monday at 6 P.M. at the Bruno Walter Auditorium, Library of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
