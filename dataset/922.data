Amar’e Stoudemire will make his season debut for the Knicks on Tuesday night, coming off the bench against the Portland Trail Blazers at Madison Square Garden.

Coach Mike Woodson could not say for sure how many minutes he would play Stoudemire, who had surgery on his left knee in October.

“We’ve just got to gauge his minutes and ease him back in,” Woodson said. “He’ll come off the bench tonight and we’ll gauge it as the game goes along.”

Stoudemire averaged 17.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in 47 games last season, and his arrival does come at an opportune time. Carmelo Anthony, who missed the past two games with a hyperextended left knee, will be back in the lineup; however, the Knicks are still without guard Raymond Felton (broken pinkie) and forward Rasheed Wallace (stress fracture in left foot).

Still, Woodson said it was unlikely Stoudemire would play close to 30 minutes.



“We’ve just got to slowly work him back in,” Woodson said.

Stoudemire was originally expected to return Christmas Day, when they Knicks played the Lakers in Los Angeles. He practiced Sunday and Monday and said he was willing to risk playing at 80 percent in order to help out his team.

Woodson said he was not sure yet how the team’s rotations might alter with Stoudemire’s return. “I’ll tinker with him tonight,” Woodson said. “I’ve got some ideas, but those ideas always change.”

Whether Stoudemire, a six-time All-Star, will come off the bench or return to the starting lineup down the road remains uncertain. Woodson said he was not ready to make a decision on that.

“Just get him through the game and ready for practice tomorrow,” Woodson said.
