Updated, 1:04 p.m. | The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is investigating whether a Staten Island girl got sick from eating hamburger meat tainted with E. coli. On Saturday, the Topps Meat Company of Elizabeth, N.J., issued a nationwide recall for 21.7 million pounds of ground beef products after reports of up to 25 cases of illness caused by suspected E. coli bacteria in eight states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

Of the 25 confirmed cases nationwide, seven have been in New York State. The illness of the Staten Island girl has not been definitively linked to the meat. The girl has been diagnosed with E. coli infection. Her mother has reported intestinal illness, but the city has not yet released a diagnosis.

This morning, The Staten Island Advance identified the girl as Brianna DiMartini, 12, of the Great Kills neighborhood. The Advance, citing interviews with the girl’s parents, reported that she has been in the pediatric intensive care unit of Staten Island University Hospital, Ocean Breeze, and that she had a hamburger made from Topps chopped meat. The Advance also reported that her mother, Allison DiMartini, has had severe intestinal distress.

The voluntary recall — an expanded version of a recall issued last Tuesday for nearly 332,000 pounds of Topps beef — was the first in the 67-year history of Topps, one of the nation’s largest meat processing concerns.

E. coli O157:H7 is a food-borne bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and kidney damage. It usually clears up within a week in adults, but can be deadly in infants, older people and those with compromised immune systems.

The official recall notice [pdf] covers a wide range of frozen hamburger patties and other products manufactured over the last year and bearing a “sell by” date between last Tuesday and Sept. 25, 2008, along with the United States Department of Agriculture designation EST 9748.

As a precaution, the city’s Health Department is urging New Yorkers to throw away any Topps ground beef hamburgers. The department urged anyone who has consumed Topps hamburgers and develops symptoms such as severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps, or blood in the stool, to visit a hospital or clinic immediately.

The city said in a statement: “As a reminder, New Yorkers can help prevent E. coli by cooking meat thoroughly (at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for ground beef), keeping raw meats and their juices away from other foods when cooking, and washing hands regularly.”

Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement: “Regulation has totally broken down and the industry is running the show. The sad fact of the matter is that food safety regulation has actually gotten weaker over the last five years and until it gets stronger, unfortunately there will be more dangerous outbreaks. We need more inspectors and have to stop letting the industry have too great a say over what the regulators do.”
