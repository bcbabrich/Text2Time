Bria Harris, 9, a third grader at the John A. Reisenbach Charter School, pinned her hopes on another chance to take in the rides at an amusement park and to romp again through a spacious playground. Medinah Powell, 8, a third grader at Community School 200, wanted another go at outrunning the children she had met in Connecticut.

Noah Howard, 7, a first grader at P.S. 30, spoke of his first swimming lessons and belly-dives into a pool, and of a parting-night campfire with his host family that had included eating chocolate and marshmallow treats known as s'mores and concluded by chasing -- and catching -- lightning bugs. He had never seen fireflies. When the children were later asked to draw pictures of their vacations, Noah drew himself in a field full of fireflies, reaching to snatch one.

The Fresh Air Fund sponsors summer vacations for more than 10,000 city children each year. More than half spend two weeks with host families along the East Coast and in Canada. Others head to campgrounds operated by the fund.

Children can register for Fresh Air Fund vacations through July, but community groups can end the process earlier. The Abyssinian Development Corporation will stop its registration by the end of this month. Until then, children can register on Tuesday nights from 5 to 7. Mrs. Gibson helps parents with the medical, school and other forms that make up the registration package. She also works to match children with families.

Opportunities provided to children through the Fresh Air Fund are important, said Kima Reed, vice president of programs for Abyssinian. ''They've had a summer experience, which can make all the difference,'' she said. ''And it helps families, too -- families who might not have had the chance to have the Disney experience.''

Kyliek, a first grader at P.S. 123, spoke fondly of taking in a baseball game last summer and being allowed onto the field to run the bases after play had finished. He also enjoyed a trip to an amusement park and ballgames with the Behans and the neighborhood children. ''I played with them every day that there was,'' he said.

He, too, drew pictures of his activities upstate: running around the infield and playing with a football, a soccer ball, a basketball and ''just a regular ball.'' He signed his name to each of his pictures except one -- a stick drawing of himself. That picture he inscribed: ''I like everything. Everyone in the world.''
