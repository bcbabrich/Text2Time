To the Editor:

Terry O'Neill (letter, March 29) says Mario M. Cuomo was ''legendary'' for discouraging ''his 'advisers' from offering advice.'' As the former head of Governor Cuomo's speechwriting office, I can only say that my experience was different. Mr. O'Neill may have felt frustrated, but for those of us on the Governor's immediate staff, new ideas -- good ones -- were a commodity, the quickest way to prove yourself and fill your in-box with instructions from the Governor to make them happen -- now!
