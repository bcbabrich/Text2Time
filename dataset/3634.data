THE Devils live. They go to Ottawa for tomorrow night's sixth game. But even with their 3-1 victory last night, their future remains in jeopardy because their four-of-seven-game Stanley Cup playoff series remains a mystery: The Case of the Missing Goals.

In finishing first in the Eastern Conference, the Devils scored 225 goals, a respectable ninth among National Hockey League teams. But in five games with eighth-seeded Ottawa, the Devils have scored only 11 goals, including one empty-net goal.

To advance in the playoffs, the Devils will need Martin Brodeur at his best, as he was last night.

Insisting, ''We do have the scorers,'' Coach Jacques Lemaire mentioned Doug Gilmour, Dave Andreychuk, Bobby Holik, Randy McKay, Steve Thomas, Brian Rolston, Patrik Elias, Jason Arnott and Brendan Morrison. But of that group, only Gilmour and Andreychuk had scored before Rolston's short-handed goal last night.

Gilmour, with the clincher last night, now has five goals (including the empty-netter), Andreychuk one. Bobby Carpenter, Denis Pederson and two defensemen, Lyle Odelein last night and Scott Stevens, produced the other goals.
