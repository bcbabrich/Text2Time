The Red Bulls (2-1-2, 8 points) were back on the field only four days after their 2-0 victory against the expansion San Jose Earthquakes last Sunday. On Wednesday, the Red Bulls traveled north to Canada for a match against Toronto F.C. (3-2-1, 10 points), which had won three straight games after starting its second season in Major League Soccer with consecutive losses.

The biggest news north of the border has been Toronto’s signing of the former MetroStars midfielder Amado Guevara. The Honduran international had two goals and an assist in the team’s first three victories. Before Thursday’s game against the Red Bulls at BMO Field, Toronto had not allowed a goal in more than 200 minutes of play.

Final Score: Red Bulls 1, Toronto F.C. 1

The Ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 5, world class):





Goalkeeper

Jon Conway

Caught a bit flat-footed on Toronto’s goal. Rushed off his line in the 76th minute to grab the ball and thwart a potential breakaway. Dealt well with cool and wet conditions. Grade: 3

Defenders

Kevin Goldthwaite

Tight across the back, but rarely ventured into the attack — like is counterparts in the defense Thursday night. Solid, if unspectacular. Grade: 3

Jeff Parke

On a rare foray into the offensive half, Parke put an nice early ball onto the head of Ángel for a shot that was high. Solid in the middle of the defense. Dollar for dollar, one of the best bargains in M.L.S. Grade: 3.5

Hunter Freeman

First start of the season after missing time because of an injury sustained as the United States under-23 team qualified for this summer’s Olympics in Beijing. A welcome replacement for a shaky Chris Leitch. Grade: 3

Midfielders

Dave van den Bergh

Got the Red Bulls even in the 39th minute on a low, left-footed shot that ended Greg Sutton’s long shutout streak at 250 minutes. Van den Bergh struck from about 25 yards out and beat Sutton to the far post.. Grade: 4

Claudio Reyna

Largely uninspired 45 minutes before being replaced by Sinisa Ubiparipovic after sustaining an injury to his lower-left leg. Seemed to be competing with Mike Magee for a share of the ball when pushing forward. Grade: 2

Seth Stammler

Early on, Stammler reintroduced himself to Amado Guevara, with a hard body check — no thought of going for the ball. Guevara was an absolute nonfactor in the second half. Stammler played the designated ball hawk most of the night. Strong, savvy defender. Grade: 3.5

Danleigh Borman

The rookie wing midfielder saw a lot of the ball in the first half and hit a couple of decent crossing balls. But struck an errant cross early in the second half after taking a nice pass from Ángel. Should have done better with it. Grade: 2.5

Mike Magee

Has shown some nice, skillful flashes as a substitute early in the season. Made his first start of 2008. Always on the lookout to spring teammates with searching through balls. Good vision. Good skills. Somehow seems to wheedle his way into dangerous and opportunistic situations. If only the guy could stay healthy. Grade: 3.5

Sinisa Ubiparipovic

Came on for second half, replacing Reyna. Picked up a yellow card (so what else is new?) in the 69th on a foul from behind on Maurice Edu. Grade: 2

Dane Richards

Entered the match in the 55th minute, replacing Borman. First action of the season for the second-year player who sustained a knee injured during the club’s preseason training (in a so-called friendly) in Salzburg, Austria. Grade: 2

Forwards

Juan Pablo Ángel

The high-scoring striker from Colombia has been hobbled by a back injury. Let his man slip away on Toronto’s goal by Marco Velez off a quick free kick. Missed a close-in header off a nice pass from Freeman in the 79th minute. Grade: 2.5

Jozy Altidore

Positioned more like an attacking midfielder, out on the right flank early on. A different look for the team and for Altidore as he sent a couple of dangerous balls into the penalty area in the first 10 minutes. Had an opponent’s body on him nearly the entire first half. Switched to left side and moved forward for second half and had some dangerous runs. Pass with outside of right foot just failed to find Richards, who was streaking to the net. Grade: 3.5

John Wolyniec

Late, late sub in stoppage time for Altidore. Grade: Incomplete

Substitutes/Did Not Play

Zach Thornton (GK), Luke Sassano, Chris Megaloudis, Eric Brunner.
