The Chevron Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest oil company, and the Southland Corporation, parent of Citgo Petroleum, yesterday reported quarterly earnings that reflected the oil industry's recent volatility.

Profits at both companies were dragged down by the slide in prices for crude oil and gasoline at the beginning of the quarter, and both benefited from the subsequent price upswing at the end of the quarter.

Chevron said that its income for the first quarter dropped 6.3 percent from the comparable period a year ago. The San Francisco-based giant earned $354 million, or $1.03 a share, compared with $378 million, or $1.10 a share, in the first quarter of 1984.

Bolstered by its $13.2 billion acquisition of the Gulf Corporation last year, Chevron's revenue jumped 72.6 percent, to $12.6 billion, from $7.3 billion for the three-month period last year. The company said that its revenues for the quarter would have fallen by 5 percent if Gulf had been excluded.
