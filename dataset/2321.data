That didn’t take long.

A new song, “50 Shots,” by the New York rapper Papoose is making the rounds on the Web. It is a profanity-laced rant about the police shooting of Sean Bell, whose funeral was tonight, with attacks on everybody from Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the patrolmen’s union, to The New York Post. “Aesthetically, the song is a mess,” says Tom Breihan of the The Village Voice, nevertheless calling it a “clear-minded and righteous example of political rage set to music.” (He has a link to the song; post your own reviews below, but please keep it clean.)



Update: Kelefa Sanneh, the music critic for The Times who reviewed a Papoose concert on Feb. 26, writes for the Saturday paper:

This is a rhyme that sometimes feels more like a vituperative blog entry. Listeners sometimes wonder why hip-hop doesn’t produce more fiery protest music. “50 Shots,” an unsubtle little song that packs a thrilling little charge, is proof that the protest tradition lives on. It may also help listeners understand why this sort of thing isn’t more common. Your average hip-hop track is more freewheeling than this one, and much more fun. If most rappers prefer boasts to brickbats — well, you can see (and hear) why.

Note: The original 12:50 p.m. post, “That Didn’t Take Long,” was updated at 10:52 p.m. Friday.
