In a packed courtroom, the Chief of Staff of the Philippine armed forces, Gen. Fabian C. Ver, and his 25 co-defendants pleaded not guilty today to the killings of former Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr., the opposition leader, and Rolando Galman at the Manila airport in 1983.

The close aide to President Ferdinand E. Marcos stood alongside nine other officers and the lone civilian accused in the case.

Behind them in three more rows were sergeants and constables who had served as Mr. Aquino's security escorts and had been with him or with Mr. Galman, the man the Government initially accused of killing Mr. Aquino on his return from the United States. Mr. Galman was slain by guards shortly after Mr. Aquino was killed.
