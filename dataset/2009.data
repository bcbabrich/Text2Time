If you’re a patriotic American who believes in extrasensory perception, I have some bad news for you — assuming you haven’t already gotten it from my brain on your personal wireless network.

It was bad enough for fans of the paranormal when my colleague Ben Carey reported that a privately financed laboratory at Princeton was shutting down and abandoning its studies of E.S.P. and telekinesis. Now, in the current issue of Nature, Lucy Odling-Smee analyzes the international implications. It turns out that America must contend with an E.S.P. gap:

The status of paranormal research in the United States is now at an all-time low, after a relative surge of interest in the 1970s. Money continues to pour from philanthropic sources to private institutions, but any chance of credibility depends on ties with universities, and only a trickle of research now persists in university labs. Elsewhere the field is livelier. Britain is a lead player, with privately funded labs at the universities of Edinburgh, Northampton and Liverpool Hope, among others.

How did this happen? I assumed there were enough psychics in California alone to guarantee America’s world leadership in this field — or at least keep us ahead of Britain. But now I’m grasping for theories to explain why we’ve fallen behind.

Could it be that Americans are getting smarter about science? At the recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, researchers reported that scientific literacy has increased in America over the past two decades, and that there’s been a decline in the percentage of college students who believe that Bigfoot exists or that psychics can predict the future. There’s also been a decline in the number who believe that extraterrestrial visitors have landed.

On the other hand, America is also the nation that produced a TV series called “Psychic Detectives.”

An alternative theory is that the Brits are just getting more eccentric. There’s some evidence for this in the Nature article:

Parapsychologist Deborah Delanoy at the University of Northampton suspects that the field is stronger in Britain because researchers tend to work in conventional psychology departments, and also do studies in ‘straight’ psychology to boost their credibility and show that their methods are sound. “We’re seen to be in the same business as other psychologists,” she says.

But why would anyone see them as being in the same business? The best that paranormal researchers have come up, after decades of study, is supposed evidence of telekinesis in experiments in which people repeatedly tried to influence machines with their thoughts. But the researchers still don’t have a coherent theory of what physical forces could be affecting the machines. And the deviation from chance that they report is miniscule: a shift of two or three events out of 10,000 trials. As Nature explains:

The difficulty is that it’s virtually impossible to prove that such subtle effects aren’t caused by some flaw in the methods or equipment. A recent meta-analysis (H. Bösch et al. Psychol. Bull. 132, 497–523; 2006) combined 380 studies on the phenomenon, often termed psychokinesis, including data from the PEAR lab. It concluded that although there is a statistically significant overall effect, it is not consistent and relatively few negative studies would cancel it out, so biased publication of positive results could be the cause.

Given the choice of believing in an inexplicable phenomenon, or believing in researchers’ bias to publish positive results, there’s not much question where one Briton would come down. In his 1748 essay on miracles, David Hume wrote:

The many instances of forged miracles, and prophecies, and supernatural events, which, in all ages, have either been detected by contrary evidence, or which detect themselves by their absurdity, prove sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous, and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind.

But that was so 18th century. Today’s British academics apparently don’t share his suspicious nature. Britannia rules the thought waves! If anyone can explain its supremacy, please let me know — the old-fashioned way, by typing.
