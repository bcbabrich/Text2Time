NOT long ago, in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Texas, a 17-year-old boy was weathering withdrawal at its worst. His body shuddered with convulsions. He hurled tables and chairs around the hospital.

Had he been hooked on heroin? Cocaine? Jim Beam? Joe Camel?

No, his psychologist said. The teen-ager had withdrawn cold turkey from the Internet.

A woman in the Pacific Northwest whose husband divorced her because she spent too much time in cyberspace continued to worship the World Wide Web so fervently that she forgot to take her children to the doctor, buy heating oil or get the kids enough food. Her ex-husband sued for custody of the children.

But he needed someone to vouch for her ailment. ''I had to write a letter to the judge,'' said Dr. Jonathan Kandell, a psychologist. ''The judge did not believe there was such a thing as Internet addiction.''
