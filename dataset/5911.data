With one eye on Democrats who would like to take over the Senate in next year's election, Mr. Anderson helped counties and New York City through the Medicaid takeover and pleased the public employee unions with pension improvements. ''Warren positioned himself well for 1984,'' said Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer, a Democrat from Long Beach, L.I., and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Bond Issues Won

To the extent that Mr. Cuomo allowed Mr. Anderson to take the lead or the credit on these issues, the success at getting action in the Legislature may come at a political price for the Democrats.

Governor Cuomo did achieve a few specific goals of his own. He won agreement from the Legislature for significant new bond issues to build prisons and rebuild transportation facilities (although the transportation bond must be approved by the Senate and then by the voters in November).

The state budget that was completed on time will make the rest of the Governor's term easier, both politically and fiscally, because it contains nearly $1 billion in new taxes and fees that the Legislature approved with relatively little dissent for such a large package. Some Defeats Too

But the session was far from a total success for Mr. Cuomo. His ambitious program for restructuring major portions of the government - by overhauling the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, reforming the Public Service Commission and merging powerful public construction authorities - was killed instantly in the State Senate.

On a number of issues - such as Mr. Cuomo's effort to lay off state workers and his proposed cuts in social programs - the Governor found himself at odds with the constituencies that helped elect him, and it is not yet clear how deep the political wounds are or what Mr. Cuomo will need to do to heal them.

Any examiniation of Mr. Cuomo's role in the session must take account of how new he was on the job. Even those who praised him tempered their compliments with that in mind.
