Although tort reform is all the rage, the number of tort cases -- civil lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege injury, loss or damage from negligent or intentional acts of the defendants -- in the region has remained steady in recent years. The movement to curtail the number of civil lawsuits picked up steam in March when the House of Representatives passed measures that would limit damages in product liability cases, make it more difficult for shareholders to sue corporations and raise the evidence threshold for obtaining punitive damages. The bills are now being considered by the Senate. Experts say the high number of tort cases in this area can be partly explained by high population density, heavy industrialization and traffic. A majority of all tort filings are auto accident cases.
