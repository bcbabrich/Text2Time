Can rock 'n' roll save a city's economy? When Jerry Grafstein, a Canadian senator, was introduced as ''a senator from SARS'' at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe this year, he decided it was time to repair the reputation of Toronto, where there have been 42 SARS fatalities, the most outside Asia. In the process perhaps something could be done about the multimillion-dollar losses of the city's tourism and hospitality industries.

So he and Dennis Mills, also a member of Parliament, looked for ways to send a message to the world that Toronto was free of severe acute respiratory syndrome and ready for the tourist and convention dollar again.

They decided there was only one answer: classic rock.

They privately raised most of the $7.1 million that the concert promoter Michael Cohl said he needed for the show. (''Quite frankly,'' Mr. Grafstein said, ''there was no way international millionaire rock stars were going to get subsidized by the government.'') The event, organized in just two months and unofficially dubbed SARSstock and SARSfest, drew some 450,000 people to Downsview Park on Wednesday to see the Rolling Stones, Justin Timberlake, AC/DC and others.

If Woodstock was an antiestablishment event, SARSstock celebrated a return to the established order with patriotic announcements, maple-leaf-flag waving, advertisements that Toronto was open for business again and a lineup loaded with local acts like Sam Roberts, the Tea Party, Blue Rodeo, Rush and the Guess Who. Though the Flaming Lips, a lovable Oklahoma psychedelic-rock act with animal-costumed dancers, donned surgical masks onstage, scarcely any SARS posters, face masks or T-shirts could be seen in the audience.
