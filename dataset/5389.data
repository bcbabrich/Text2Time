An emphasis to buy everything new stirs gardeners to neglect the old-fashioned favorites. This is especially true with perennials. I like to think of a child's song that contains some good advice: ''Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver and the other is gold.''

To become acquainted with some of these long-ago favorites, I have gathered together some of mine. The plants share the general characteristic of not liking more than eight hours of sun and many grow quite nicely in partial shade. In addition, they are hardy within the greater New York metropolitan area to -20 degrees. The perennials are listed in their order of bloom in my garden in Princeton, N.J.

For April, there is Jacob's ladder (Polemonium caeruleum). Even at the turn of the century, this plant was described as ''old-fashioned, but well worth universal cultivation.'' The dainty, light blue flowers grace the top of 18-inch stems and offer a cheery contrast to the bright yellows and whites of daffodils. While the flowers are generally gone by mid-May, the green, somewhat fernlike foliage, remains attractive.

Candytuft (Iberis sempervirens) is for May. The species designation sempervirens means ''always green.'' This low-growing plant supplies just that attribute throughout most of the year. Indeed, the stubby leaves look in some ways like thick pine needles. In early May, candytuft is completely covered with two-inch clusters of dazzling white flowers. A century ago, this was a favorite edging plant in all-white gardens.
