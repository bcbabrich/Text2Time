Washington's relations with Israel have been relatively smooth during the gulf crisis, American and Israeli officials say. Israel has been responsive to American requests that it not become directly involved in the conflict, or take any pre-emptive action against Iraq. Washington, in turn, made clear that it was willing to consider added military aid to Israel.

The crisis has deflected attention from the impasse that had been developing between the Administration and Jerusalem over the Israeli Government's reluctance to open a dialogue with the Palestinians on the basis of a compromise formula proposed last spring by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.

To bolster Saudi Arabia against a possible attack from Iraq, the Administration announced this week that it would make an emergency sale of $2.2 billion worth of weapons to Riyadh, including 24 F-15 fighter planes, 150 M-60 tanks and 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, Pentagon officials said the United States would probably sell the Saudis another 24 F-15's early next year.

''The White House and State Department called to say they recognized an imbalance was occurring and that some form of additional weaponry for Israel would be found to remedy that,'' said Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota.

'Shifting Alliances'

One leader of an American Jewish group, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ''Arms to the Saudis pose a real dilemma for the Jewish community. On the one hand Saudi Arabia has legitimate defense needs right now. But this latest package constitutes a clear threat to Israel in the long run. No one knows what will happen to Saudi Arabia in the future. Middle East politics is made up of shifting alliances.''

Several hurdles must still be cleared to complete the proposed arms deal. One problem is matching the list of weapons that Israel wants with what the United States can afford to give up.

Soviet Talks May Free Tanks

The Pentagon, for example, expects to have surplus M-60 tanks once arms control talks with the Soviet Union are concluded. The available tanks, however, are an older version of the model the Israelis would like, and would not be available for several months.
