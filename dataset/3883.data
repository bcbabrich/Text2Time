DEAR DIARY:

Recently, when buying tickets at Avery Fisher Hall, I handed over a charge card to the young man behind the ticket window and continued my conversation with my two daughters.

The young man handed back the form to sign and said, ''I must say, you look better in person.''

Startled, I looked down at the card.

I had given him the American Kennel Club charge card, which has a photograph of a Welsh corgi in the upper corner. SARA REGUER

A loud banging at 2 A.M. drew Barbara Rohdie's daughter-in-law, Alisa, to the window of her Greenwich Village apartment recently, and she noted a tow-truck hitching up a car. She suggested that her husband check to see if their car had met a similar fate.
