The Energy Department said today that it planned to carry out the first in a series of nuclear weapons experiments intended to assure the safety of the United States' aging nuclear arsenal. Department officials said the tests would not violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

Some environmental and arms-control organizations have tried to stop the tests, which begin Wednesday, arguing that they are inconsistent with a post-cold-war policy of reducing the nuclear arms threat. But the Government maintains that the tests, in which scientists at the Nevada Test Site will set off high-powered explosives to measure their effect on plutonium, are needed to learn how to assure the reliability of aging nuclear weapons by some means other than blowing them up. The experiments are allowed, the department argues, because no nuclear reaction will occur.

The experiments ''are essential to the United States' commitment to a world free of nuclear testing while maintaining a reliable nuclear deterrent,'' the department said.

But six prominent arms-control experts released a letter today to the White House, the Energy Department and the Pentagon asking for international inspections to demonstrate that the tests were non-nuclear.
