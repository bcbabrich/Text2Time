Maggert had a chance to end the match at No. 18, but his 15-foot putt for birdie slid past the hole, as the crowd moaned, while Maggert stared at the ball and the cup in disbelief. But two holes later Maggert ended the match at No. 11, after hitting an 8-iron for his tee shot that landed near the green in the left rough.

''I had the kind of chip where I could make it,'' Maggert said. ''It was uphill, had a little left-to-right break. The last thing I wanted to do was run it four or five feet by, but I hit it a little bit too hard. Even when I saw it hit the hole, I thought it was going to pop out. And it went in.''

There were many shifts in momentum throughout the match, which started with 18 holes in the morning, followed by 18 more holes and then the two extra holes in the afternoon. Magee was 3 up through eight holes in the morning, and he started the afternoon play still leading, 2 up. But as he did throughout the tournament, Maggert remained steady and confident, despite struggling with putts from 5 to 10 feet, and he slowly whittled away at his early deficit.

''If it was a nine-hole tournament I might have won, but I had 27 more to play,'' Magee said. Asked if he thought about the prize money, Magee laughed and said: ''I thought about the money all day. I knew what was at stake.''

But Maggert walked away with the top prize, moving to the top of the tour's money list this year. And the victory will elevate Maggert's recognition factor with the public. His peers have long recognized Maggert as a solid player, but with six victories this week, including the defeats of top-seeded Tiger Woods, and Nick Price and Bernhard Langer, Maggert rose to the occasion and won the first event of the new World Golf Championships series.

Maggert came close to winning the United States Open in 1997, before faltering on the back nine and finishing fourth. Perhaps with this victory, the 35-year-old Maggert will become even more confident during a tournament's crucial moments.

''I knew inside that I had what it took to win tournaments,'' Maggert said. ''Guys that can play well when they are nervous are guys that win tournaments. You can't be afraid of it. Everyone chokes in golf. That is just a fact of life. I have choked before. Sometimes I don't choke. But being nervous is part of the game. I was nervous, but I was confident.''

And today, having refused to let another tournament slip away, Maggert was a winner. ''It was a long week, probably the biggest win of my career,'' he said. ''You've got the top 64 guys playing and match play is a very difficult format. The biggest thing is, I can just be myself now. If I finish second now, it's O.K. Now I can go out and have fun.''
