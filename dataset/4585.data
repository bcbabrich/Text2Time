You grew up with rock-and-roll and remember when Elvis was King, the Beatles were fab and Michael Jackson was in grade school. But increasingly you've noticed signs of advancing years as unmistakable as crow's feet and love handles.

You're hooked on the Delta blues of Robert Johnson instead of the rock of Jane's Addiction, and worry that Phil Collins and Genesis are speaking for you when they title an album "We Can't Dance." You watch the older stars on VH-1 more than the young turks on MTV. You recognize a rap song, when you do, by the James Brown tune it samples, not the rapper. And you're genuinely interested in how Dick Clark keeps his youthful looks.

Take a deep breath. You're having a mid rock crisis.

Tom Vickers, a 42-year-old talent scout for Mercury Records, says he coined the phrase five years ago after retreating backstage during a concert by an aging superstar. "When an act you love is on its second encore," he said, "and you're bored out of your mind, then you know you're having a midrock crisis."

But the midrock crisis is more than boredom. On a personal level, it's the realization that, while you still think of yourself as hip, you would not know a Dramarama from a Teen-Age Fanclub -- and don't particularly care. Culturally, it is the inevitable confusion that results from the fact that rock-and-roll, a style born of youthful rebellion, now loosely defines music that can appeal to anyone from 6 to 60. Cosmically, it is what may keep rock-and-roll from making a great leap forward, until the retro midrockers are too old to have an influence.
