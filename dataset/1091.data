Dance

Start the dance year with a bracing palate cleanser, AMERICAN REALNESS, a festival that opens its third edition at the Abrons Center on Thursday. But be warned: It is not a festival for wimps. “This is not psychological realism,” the news release sternly states. “This is not pretty dancing on a stage. It is theater, dance, performance and song as phenomenological event.” But even people who force you to look up “phenomenological” can be forgiven when they manage to include John Jasperse, Jennifer Lacey, Eleanor Bauer and Heather Lang, Trajal Harrell, Wally Cardona, Jeremy Wade, Daniel Linehan, Jack Ferver, Keith Hennessy and Ann Liv Young over 10 stimulating days of performance and events.

Outside of the multiple shows are talks with the artists, work-in-progress showings and two exhibitions. One is of performance photography by Michael Hart, accompanied by text by the dancer turned composer-performer Ryan Tracy. The other features paintings and sculpture linked to the work of the choreographer Sarah Michelson — or, in American Realness-speak, “a survey of the iconic and mythological, sculptural or decorative representations of the self through which Sarah Michelson visibly owns and authors her performance works.” Phenomenological events? A lot of fun? Both? Through Jan. 15, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, abronsartscenter.org; $15, exhibitions, discussions and work-in-progress showings are free.
