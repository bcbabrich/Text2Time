Mark Bennett, the state attorney general, is leading an investigation into what went wrong at the dam.

But on Friday, Representative Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii, said he would ask the local United States attorney, Ed Kubo, to take over the investigation.

"The circumstances are so fraught with difficulty with regard to the state's position that I'm hoping that they will consider either a federal attorney or a special investigator," Mr. Abercrombie said.

Ka Loko Reservoir was built in the late 19th century to provide a steady source of water for the Kilauea Sugar Company on Kauai's North Shore. A mountain-hugging series of ditches designed by German engineers was built to deliver fresh water to the reservoir.

After the sugar company closed in 1972, the reservoir, the dam and much of the land nearby were eventually divided up for sale. In 1987 a Honolulu auto dealer, James Pflueger, bought about two-thirds of the reservoir, including the dam, as well as much of the surrounding land.

According to state law, owners of private reservoirs and dams are responsible for their repair and maintenance. Mr. Young, of the natural resources department, said officials had tried to contact Mr. Pflueger several times over the last decade to schedule an inspection. A certified letter sent by the department on Dec. 27, 2001, warned that if Mr. Pflueger did not respond within two weeks, inspectors would enter the reservoir without his consent.

There is no record of a response. Mr. Young said that when he asked his employees, they told him that an inspection could not be arranged.

State officials say that after the dam broke, they were unable to locate the spillway at Ka Loko, which serves as a release valve when the water gets too high. Residents say that the spillway has not been visible since 1998 and that it is under several feet of dirt.

A farmer, Mike Strong, accused Mr. Pflueger of covering up the spillway "so he could stockpile the water, control the water," which would presumably enhance the value of the land around it.

"I complained to him in 1998," Mr. Strong said. "We were worried about it, and we told him that he can't close off the spillway."

Neither Mr. Pflueger, now 80 and retired, nor his lawyer, William McCorriston, responded to several messages seeking comment.

At least seven storms have hit the Hawaiian Islands since mid-February, breaking rainfall records. Mount Waialeale, a few miles from Ka Loko, has registered nearly 130 inches of rain since Feb. 19.

Five days before the dam gave way, Mr. Pflueger was fined $7.5 million by the federal Environmental Protection Agency for creating water and mud runoff in November 2001 that resulted in land and reef destruction on a nearby property he owns in the coastal community of Pilaa. It was among the largest fines ever for violation of the Clean Water Act and brought to $12 million the fines he has accumulated.

Mr. Pflueger also faces a civil lawsuit over that runoff, which inundated the home of Amy and Richard Marvin. Ms. Marvin, who said the case was in mediation, expressed her frustration.

"Because of the constant harassment of us and our children by Mr. Pflueger, we are even willing to sell our property to him just to get out from under his influence," she said.
