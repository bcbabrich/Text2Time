LONDON, Oct. 31 - Telefónica of Spain agreed Monday to buy the British mobile phone company O2 for $31.5 billion in a deal that could spur greater competition in Europe's more established markets.

"My view is that Telefónica is in aggressive acquisition mode," said Satyajit Chatterjee, a credit analyst with Société Générale in London, referring to the price offered for O2.

With the O2 deal, Telefónica swings its attention fully back to Europe from Latin America, where it paid $5.85 billion for the wireless assets of BellSouth last year, and where it has established a broad presence with billions of dollars in acquisitions since the 1990's.

Telefónica also spent 3.6 billion euros earlier this year to acquire 69 percent of Cesky Telecom, the Czech Republic's largest telecommunications company.
