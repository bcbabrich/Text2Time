Although he is the Mayor of this valley idyll in the Cape wine country, Frank Arendse does not quite live here. He lives down the road in the mixed-race or "colored" township called Groendal, beyond the antique shops and the food boutiques, where the road turns from asphalt to red mud.

Mr. Arendse, whose forebears include an English soldier and a slave from Madagascar, is the first nonwhite Mayor to preside over a white jurisdiction in modern South Africa.

In 1985 an American anthropologist chose this hamlet, disguised under the pseudonymn "Wyndal," to conduct a study of South African whites. They emerged as comfortable and self-absorbed racists. Mr. Arendse says that his selection as Mayor is a great responsibility and an opportunity to get the roads paved on his side of town. It is not, he fears, a sign that rural South Africa has suddenly gone colorblind. A Merging of 2 Towns

He became Mayor last month after the adjoining towns were merged into a single municipality, embracing about 3,000 people of mixed race, 500 blacks, and 1,200 whites. The powerless advisory committee that had previously represented the mixed-race majority before the whites-only city council was absorbed into the council, pending an election. Two white council members crossed over to elect Mr. Arense Mayor, 8 to 4, which means he has the tie-breaking vote in governing the town.
