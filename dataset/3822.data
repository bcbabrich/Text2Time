Indeed, the nonprofit institutions traditionally relied on for incubating transfer hits -- Lincoln Center Theater, the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club -- all failed to deliver. So did a dazzling assembly of some of this country's finest playwrights. Ms. Wasserstein's ''American Daughter,'' Craig Lucas's ''God's Heart,'' Christopher Durang's ''Sex and Longing'' and Lanford Wilson's ''Sympathetic Magic'' were muddled disappointments.

Yet if these plays were, to different degrees, failures, they were noble failures, hamstrung by nothing less than their desire to tackle big subjects. The problem was that each wore its themes (politics and sex, politics and gender, politics and cosmology) like bumper stickers, without connecting them to any persuasive sense of character or situation. Granted, the theater of polemics, if invested with enough outrage, can occasionally flare entertainingly as a sustained rant. Witness Jonathan Reynolds's fiery if long-winded diatribe against political correctness, ''Stonewall Jackson's House.'' But it usually takes more than a Shavian debate, especially without Shavian vitality, to hold our emotions.

Consider the Vineyard Theater's ''How I Learned to Drive,'' one of only two not-for-profit productions to make a commercial transfer. (It is now at the Century Theater Center.) In it, Ms. Vogel embraces a subject, child molestation, that has been too tidily and too often rehashed in best sellers and TV movies and turns it into a seductive memory play that startles at every turn, undermining easy assumptions in both form and content. Under Mark Brokaw's deceptively light-handed direction, with terrific performances by David Morse and Mary-Louise Parker, the production gives the illusion of coming to troubled life before your eyes. Gracefully stylized, it also generates a sense of spontaneity that never lets its audience become too comfortable.

That is what one asks of the theater, of course, and what no other medium can provide. In a world increasingly dominated by replicated, distancing images, theater exists unconditionally in the present tense and at its best appears to invent itself on the spot. Again, the formula for creating such magic isn't easily broken down.

Who would have thought, for example, that 19th-century courtroom transcripts, generously laced with academic and contemporary journalistic commentary, could be edited and shaped into something as sensationally involving as Moises Kaufman's ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde''? Mr. Kaufman, both the writer and director of the play (the other nonprofit commercial transfer, this time to the Minetta Lane), has created a work as artificial and mannered as a Wildean epigram. Yet within minutes of the first scene you have accepted its terms; you have already learned to think, in other words, in the original theatrical language that Mr. Kaufman has devised.

Wilde himself (Michael Emerson, in a career-making performance) effectively loses his case when the artistic frame through which he sees and presents life slips. Because Mr. Kaufman expertly holds onto his stylistic frame, which locates the protagonist both in time and in history, he allows us to experience Wilde's real pain all the more acutely. A Wildean paradox in itself, its use achieves an effect of which both film and written fiction are incapable.

''The Waste Land,'' T. S. Eliot's recondite, generation-defining poem of 1922, seemed to be another most unlikely candidate for theatrical adaptation. Yet the brilliant Irish actress Fiona Shaw, in a one-woman show directed by Deborah Warner, brought a specific emotional clarity to the work that never stooped to literal explanations. The result was astonishingly affecting.
