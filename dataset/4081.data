IN the five years since Yugoslavia entered its spiral of ethnic barbarism, outside diplomats have often laid much of the blame at the feet of two ambitious men: Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. Each built his own political fortune on a base of nationalist passions that he stirred up among his countrymen when Communism collapsed.

Now, suddenly, it seems as if both could be quickly forced out of power -- Mr. Milosevic by widespread street protests and Mr. Tudjman by cancer. So the question naturally arises: Would that help in the quest for a Balkan peace?

The answer is: Perhaps, but probably not.

The people who surround the two Presidents are indeed preparing for their departure. But it is far from certain that the virulent nationalism, repression and rampant corruption that have come to characterize their rule in Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia (which comprises Serbia and Montenegro) will be lessened.

One reason is that behind the two men stand groups of hard-line nationalists who do not flinch at the use of force, have little tolerance for parliamentary niceties or a free press and will not be eager to share power, given the privileges and wealth they have amassed.
