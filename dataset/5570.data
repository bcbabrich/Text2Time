Who ordained that the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which spans the entrance to New York Harbor, should be toll-free eastbound? No less authority than the Congress of the United States, that's who.

This Federal intrusion on city traffic management grew out of a local squabble.

The bridge links Staten Island and Brooklyn and carries through traffic between Long Island and New Jersey, and points west. The toll gates are all on Staten Island, and the backup of waiting cars fouled the air. Staten Islanders therefore petitioned for free passage eastbound and double tolls for the westbound return.

Local and state authorities refused. The one-way toll on the bridge would make possible a cheap round trip for drivers who cross into Brooklyn on the bridge and then return via Manhattan and the Holland Tunnel, which is free westbound. That would reduce revenues for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority - and create perpetual gridlock in lower Manhattan.

The Staten Islanders then took their proposal to their Representative, Guy Molinari, who pushed it through Congress with the help of his fellow Republican, Senator Alfonse D'Amato.
