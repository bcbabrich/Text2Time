Japan's unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 5.1 percent in August as more people stopped looking for work, the government statistics agency reported. The labor force fell by 310,000, reflecting a labor market that is still stagnant, but the jobless rate fell because those who stopped looking for work were not counted as unemployed. Another measure of the economy improved, however, as spending by households headed by a salaried worker grew 2.2 percent in August. The increase came largely as a result of a big decline in spending in July. Ken Belson (NYT)
