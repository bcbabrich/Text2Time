NEW ORLEANS — N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell suggested Friday that the league could use suspensions more often to enforce its crackdown on hits to the head. During the season, the league suspended Ravens safety Ed Reed for his third violation of rules prohibiting helmet-to-helmet hits on defenseless players. The suspension was overturned on appeal by Ted Cottrell, an N.F.L. hearing officer.

“I think we’re going to have to continue to see discipline escalate, particularly on repeat offenders,” Goodell said. “It’s not just the player, the defenseless player, that’s being protected; it’s the person doing the striking. We see in the injury rates that the defenseless player and the defensive back are having a higher injury rate.”

When players keep violating the rule, they’re going to be taken off the field, he said, adding,“Suspension gets through to them.”

Goodell made the remarks during his annual state-of-the-league news conference, which was heavy with questions about player safety. It came one day after players union leaders, at a Thursday news conference, challenged the league on several player safety issues.



Union leaders said that they wanted a neutral chief safety officer to be appointed to hear appeals about acceptable levels of care, and that an internal survey of players showed that most did not trust their team’s medical staff. The union offered no numbers from the survey.

Goodell sounded irritated by the union’s announcements, noting two times that the league and union met for four hours last week — with players and owners in attendance — and the survey had not been raised by the union, an indication of the fractured relationship between the league and the players.

Among the other topics Goodell touched on:

He thinks the N.F.L. will have testing for human growth hormone for the 2013 season. The league and union agreed to start testing when the collective bargaining agreement was completed 18 months ago, but since then they have sparred over the details, and Congress has begun to apply pressure to get the agreement finished.

He said the league would look to set standards for the quality of playing fields, probably a reaction to the sloppy turf at FedEx Field.

He said his only regret from the Saints’ bounty scandal was his inability to get everyone — he singled out the union — to realize that bounties must be eliminated from the game.

GIANTS PUNTER’S DENIAL Mitch Ross, who told Sports Illustrated that he had given Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis a spray form of deer antler extract, containing a substance banned by the N.F.L., told reporters that he had also supplied other N.F.L. players with the spray, including Giants punter Steve Weatherford.

Weatherford denied the allegation in a message on Twitter, writing: “I have never used anything illegal in my life. Being a role model is too important to me. These claims are a marketing ploy.” Weatherford has consulted with a lawyer, Peter Siachos, about Ross’s statements.

Lewis has also denied having used the substance.
