''I loved camp,'' he said. ''It's about being outdoors and camaraderie. This should be a time away from technology.''

When Abbie Meyer's 9-year-old son, Clayton, went to Camp Tecumseh in New Hampshire this summer, she paid $1 per printed e-mail in a service that included a colorful border and delivery to Clayton the same day. Over three weeks she sent several e-mail messages and some old-fashioned letters. Children at Camp Tecumseh were not allowed to send e-mail messages back.

''The campers had to use traditional methods,'' said Ms. Meyer, who lives in Summit. She received one letter a week from her son. ''Did he appreciate e-mail over a letter? I don't think it made a difference to him.''

Mr. Brennan, the Yankees fan, said his son Chris, who follows baseball, likes the up-to-date information he can get by way of e-mail during his stay at Kingsley Pines Camp in Raymond, Me. ''He specifically told me this year he wants information on the Yankees and the Red Sox,'' Mr. Brennan said. As a parent, Mr. Brennan appreciates the weekly updated photo gallery from the camp. Last year, he adapted one of the photos, of his son water skiing, as the screen saver on his computer.

Katherine Sankovich of Short Hills said her children -- Taylor, 14, and Michael, 11 -- both attended camps where letters were the only form of communication. ''From my experience and with my children it was just fine,'' she said. But she did have the chance of seeing a camp more up close and personal when a goddaughter, Kimberly Richardson, went to Camp Illahee near Brevard, N.C. Kimberly's mother, Nancy Richardson, was able to get pictures off the camp Web site and transmit them by e-mail to friends and family like Ms. Sankovich.

''It was really fun, especially for me because I only see her twice a year,'' Ms. Sankovich said.

Ms. Richardson, who lives in Atlanta, agreed, saying: ''It was great. You can see that they are having fun.'' And Kimberly liked getting the printed e-mail messages the same day her mother wrote them. ''It was a lot quicker than getting a letter,'' she said.

But some families and camps are rejecting Web photographs and e-mail in favor of letters and postcards. Red Pine Camp near Minocqua, Wis., includes a photo gallery on its Web site, but it plans to post new photos only after camp has ended in August; that way, campers and their parents can all see them when they are at home.
