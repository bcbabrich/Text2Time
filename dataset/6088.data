EAST HARTFORD, Aug. 31—Frank Daniel DeCorleto, the convicted murderer who killed his wife and 4‐year‐old son and then committed suicide yesterday, had won custody of the child from a previous marriage because the child's mother was too afraid of him to fight for the boy, according to the lawyer who represented her in the custody fight.

“He always had guns,” said Michael J. Graham, the Hartford lawyer who represented the mother, Kathy DeCorleto. “He pulled a gun on her and pointed it at her head.

“He was just visiting with Frankie for, like, a couple of days a week. One time he just didn't return Frankie. She was just afraid to fight back.

“It wasn't just simply that she gave up after a year of fighting. She was really worn down from that battle.”
