With his sweep in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington, Gov. George W. Bush's troubled presidential campaign has wrung an essential victory from three disparate states. But once again Senator John McCain pointed up the soft spot in Mr. Bush's candidacy by drawing strong support in Virginia and possibly elsewhere among independents, moderates and Democratic crossovers. Mr. Bush's partisans argued last night that Senator McCain's challenge to religious fundamentalists had backfired, rallying loyal Republicans to the governor's side. All of the results set up a tremendously important showdown in the March 7 ''Super Tuesday'' primaries. The battleground states of California and Ohio, where Mr. Bush leads, and in New York, which is a toss-up, may well determine whether Mr. McCain will be remembered as a transforming or a transitory figure in the G.O.P.

For the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore's victory in Washington State threatens yet another blow to former Senator Bill Bradley's candidacy. Mr. Bradley needed at least a credible showing against Mr. Gore in order to revive his chances in New York and California, where he has been running behind. A bad defeat when all the votes in Washington are counted could feed pressures on him to withdraw.

For both parties, yesterday's voting set the stage for a more nationalized phase of the nominating process. Republicans everywhere are wondering whether Mr. McCain's daring attempt to redefine his party is an act of historic farsightedness or self-destruction. The party's establishment is working hard to push Mr. Bush to the nomination, and his triple win will restore their wavering faith. But they are not yet sure whether to ignore Mr. McCain's disturbing message that catering to religious conservatives is becoming an outdated strategy, especially outside the Sun Belt.

Mr. McCain's success so far has arisen from his ability to set the terms of the debate. To that end, it was smart of him to reverse his decision to skip the final debate before the March 7 round of primaries. By agreeing to participate from a live hookup in New York, Mr. McCain shores up his support in New York and the New England states that vote on Super Tuesday. Mr. McCain's future may depend on how much strength he shows in those states, given Mr. Bush's expected appeal in the Southern states voting that day.
