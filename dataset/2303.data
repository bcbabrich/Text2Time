In a company once legendary for its "lifers," he is a new kind of middle manager. When Steinway hired him in 2000, he had no experience in woodworking but fifteen years of manufacturing everything from leather goods to lemonade. He replaced a foreman who retired after forty-one years of making rims. Gurrado, who is in his early fifties and whose hair is going from black to steel gray, stepped into one of the factory's toughest jobs. As a foreman, he is a frontline manager. The workers have their union. Upper-level managers can insulate themselves from the day-to-day problems. The foremen cannot. The foremen are responsible when their men fall behind because someone called in sick, because a machine broke down, because someone misread a specification. They are responsible when they do not set an example by wearing safety glasses ("My eyelashes are too long" was the excuse of a foreman whom Steinway later fired) or when they take their men to lunch. Steinway frowns even more on foremen who take half their men to lunch (especially if they happen to return to work a few minutes late). All that upper-level managers will say about a foreman they have fired is something as vague as "It just didn't work out." A sentence like that hints at the camaraderie at the factory, the closeness of the workers and the foremen and the plant managers. The foremen are the ones who must "feed the next guy," as Gurrado puts it-to provide the foreman in the next department with whatever the schedule calls for. For Gurrado, that means rims ready to have their rough edges sliced off.

Gurrado is eager to show how much he has absorbed as the foreman with the least time on the payroll. It is no coincidence that among the factory's twelve foremen, he is the only one who regularly wears polo shirts with "Steinway & Sons" stitched above his heart. He is aware that he is probably still seen as a newcomer and may be resented for being on a fast track to some higher job. He has mastered the lingo and probably the details. If one of his men does not show up in the morning, he could step in and do the job without missing a beat. His we're-in-this-together attitude conveys the pressures he feels. This may not be rocket science, he seems to say, but neither is it easy. There is an art to bending these rims, to knowing just how much glue to spread on the wood, to finding the almost imperceptible dips in the surface of the maple where an extra touch is needed to force the strips into an almost-90-degree turn at the far end.

Gurrado is built like a brawler but is in fact the kind of boss who would like to be liked, not the kind whose first response to a worker's foul-up is to lose his temper. He speaks Spanish passably, which helps some of his men understand his commands. In English, he pronounces the word "length," a staple in the vocabulary of someone whose job is to give orders for measuring and trimming, without the k sound. The way he says it, it rhymes with "plinth."

Gurrado lives about five miles from the factory, on the block on which he grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, a working-class neighborhood with huge rail yards that funnel commuter trains toward Manhattan. His father was a machinist with the New York City Transit Authority, working on the axle-and-wheel mechanisms on subway cars. Gurrado was an assistant manager for a clothing maker in the garment district in Manhattan and then a supervisor in a sugar refinery, where a powerful union had won what it considered an important concession in a round-the-clock operation: No one worked the same shift two weeks in a row. If you had day hours this week, you would work the overnight shift next week and the 4 P.M.-to-midnight shift the week after. Gurrado found that the constant rotation wore him out. He also felt it lowered morale at the factory. He started casting about for another job.

A headhunter he knew tipped him off that Steinway was looking for someone with supervisory experience. The headhunter figured Gurrado would jump at the short commute. "I said, 'But I don't know anything about a piano. They wouldn't hire me,'" Gurrado recalls. "He said, 'Don't be so sure.' He had more experience in placing people and he knew that quite often, they're not looking for specific knowledge in their business because they have to teach you that. They're looking for a certain background that they could utilize, develop."

Steinway hired him and assigned him to various supervisory projects that exposed him to the different parts of the factory. "They really didn't have any openings to run departments, but they knew that in the near future they would, because they had older people working there and they knew that they were going to retire," he says. After two years, when the longtime foreman in rim-bending put in his papers, Gurrado took over.

It is somehow fitting that Gurrado, the newcomer, ended up in rim-bending, a department that was once dominated by Italians. By the 1980s, Caribbean immigrants had begun taking the Italians' places. In the 1990s, the labor pool changed again. Gurrado's crew includes three Bosnians. One of them, Nazif Sutrovic, was a police official in Sarajevo during the 1984 Winter Olympics. His English is balky, so when he jokes that he used to put people in jail, the punch line falls flat. His explanation for his trouble with English is embarrassed but impeccably worded: "I don't have time to go to school." He has another job, as the superintendent of a Brooklyn apartment building. The crew chief, Eric Lall, who is Gurrado's No. 2 man, was hired in 1992 after working as a shipping supervisor in a jewelry store. And Tommy Stavrianos-at twenty-eight, the youngest man on the crew-talks proudly of the pianos he makes and of the company's traditions. But Gurrado and his men are not the concert-hall regulars that their pianos are. The radios around the factory play soft rock and jazz.

Gurrado's load report shows that K0862 will have what Steinway calls an ebonized finish, meaning that it will be lacquered black and will look like concert grands that took shape a generation ago, or before World War II, or before World War I. The guts of K0862-the strings, the hammers that strike them, the keys to which the hammers are attached-will be made according to plans and specifications that date to the 1880s and 1890s. But is a brand-new piano ready the moment it leaves the factory?

In the 1920s, a golden age for Steinway, there were probably pianists and tuners who complained that the best pianos were those made at the end of the nineteenth century. Some pianists today have a fondness for Steinways from the 1920s. But as for what comes out of the factory these days, the company's president, Bruce A. Stevens, is adamant that "older is not better, and we can prove it." Sitting behind his big desk in the factory's corner office, Stevens declares, "Where that started was with people who make their living rebuilding Steinways, and they tell their customers that. We've just about given up rebutting it." But not completely. A moment later, he is still in full rebuttal mode, spitting out words like "poppycock." His frustration continues to boil, but he seems to be reining himself in because he is talking to an outsider whose tape recorder is sitting on his desk, taking in every word.

Steinway has done some modernizing over the decades. Computer-generated bar codes now track the parts of a piano in the making. For years, starting just after World War II, that was done on paper, and when problems arose at the factory, Henry Z. Steinway, the great-grandson of the company's founder, had the final say. The rank and file respected him for more than his name, his patrician bearing, or his Harvard degree. He understood the old manufacturing methods. Since childhood, he had heard about nothing else.

Henry Z. Steinway retired in 1980, and machines now cut the wood for the lids and legs, operations that were done by hand in his day. "This is furniture making," says Andrew Horbachevsky, who, as a manufacturing director, oversees foremen like Gurrado. But Henry Z. Steinway would recognize much of what goes on at the factory. "There are operations we can't automate," Horbachevsky says. "That would take the soul out of Steinway." One of those operations, rim-bending, is the one that Gurrado took over in 2002. It has gone unchanged for so long because the piano has gone unchanged for so long.

Steinway's earliest grands did not have rigid rims. Steinway made hundreds of pianos before it perfected the design of the rim that will go into K0862, as well as the techniques for making it. One of the Steinway sons, C.F. Theodore, held more than forty patents and was friendly with the pioneering physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. In marrying the methodology of science to the making of pianos, they reasoned that longer and stronger strings would produce a larger and louder sound. But it would also put extreme pressure on the rim.

C.F. Theodore Steinway's solution is Gurrado's day-in, day-out responsibility: the lamination of rims. Gluing thin strips of wood together creates a better rim than one made from just one or two thick boards, because even the glue adds strength. Such a rim is so strong, Gurrado says, that if you karate-chop two strips that have been glued together, the break will come in the wood; the glue joint will hold. Another Steinway relative, Theodore Cassebeer, the factory manager after World War I, improved on C. F. Theodore's handiwork. Until Cassebeer tinkered with it, rim-bending had been a two-part process involving separate inner and outer rims. Steinway built the nine boards for the inner rim first, using less expensive poplar. The soundboard was glued to that rim; the heavy metal plate was bolted onto it; the strings and the keys were squeezed inside. Only later did the rim-benders fit the eight boards of the outer rim around the piano. If they bent both rims at once, the inner rim cracked. It turned out that would not happen if they used maple instead of poplar on the inner rim, the same as on the outer rim. The savings in labor easily offset the higher cost of the maple.

Laminating the rim was one of the innovations that made possible an instrument with a big sound, the grand piano on which Steinway built its reputation. Still, the rim is only the structural framework for the piano. It does not contribute to a big-sounding piano's greatness, or to a lemon's disappointment. The rim is a big, inanimate backstop. The most the rim has to do with the sound is to return "airflow"-the sound waves themselves-to the sounding board for more amplification. Yet that does not give rim-benders license to be sloppy. A rim, Gurrado says, must meet close tolerances. "It has to," he says, "because the parts that are going to fit in it down the road all have to fit in exactly. I mean, being that it's mostly a handmade instrument, each part is finessed. But it's finessed to a specification. It's not just 'We'll make it fit by cutting off an inch,' no."

The strips that go into Joe Gurrado's rims are maple-hard-rock maple, though that is a term that you will never hear from a forester. The attributes a piano builder will mention are strength and evenness, and maybe cost. "You wouldn't build it out of walnut or cherry," Gurrado says. Walnut is almost as hard as maple, but far more expensive, and it has gnarly, swirling grain patterns that make bending difficult. Cherry has a more serious shortcoming: "gum pockets," which are exactly what the term suggests, could cause weak spots in a rim. . . .
