To the Editor:

In ''Matters of Emphasis'' (column, April 29), Paul Krugman says he believes that we'll ''eventually find some poison gas or crude biological weapons'' in Iraq, but not ''true W.M.D.'s.''

Isn't ''crude biological weapon'' an oxymoron? Would the tiny amounts of anthrax that gripped us with fear be a crude biological weapon?

I would agree that President Bush pushed some buttons by emphasizing certain matters as the pretext for war, but while Mr. Krugman sees this as dishonest, I see it simply as necessary given the circumstances.
