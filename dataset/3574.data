NACKENSON-Leon. We mourn the passing of Leon Nackenson on Dec. 24, 1997. A devoted husband to the late Eva, father of Caryl and Gary, grandfather of Julie, Edgar and Henry. A company executive with Louis Dreyfus for thirty-five years, Leon was also an avid bridge player, opera buff, tennis enthusiast and world traveler. He left an indelible mark on those he came in contact with; his goodness and sincerity were always apparent. He leaves us with a lifetime of wonderful memories.
