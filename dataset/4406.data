"I used to be open about my feelings. Now, everything is just stuck in. There is so much anger and frustration inside I don't know how to take it out. I won't trust anyone, and, I don't know, I'm kind of afraid of everything." -- WILFREDO FELICIANO, who was 14 when he was stabbed outside a Brooklyn housing project. [ B14:2. ]
