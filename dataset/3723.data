INSIDE TERRORISM

The tone is temperate, which makes the message of this book even more alarming: terrorism works, and the worst is yet to come. And although the author, a leading academic authority on terrorism and political violence, does not say so directly, it is fairly clear after reading ''Inside Terrorism'' that cruise missile attacks are not likely to be very effective in countering today's terrorists.

Equally disturbing, lest anyone harbor any optimistic thoughts about the war on terrorism, Bruce Hoffman reminds us that it is not a modern phenomenon. ''More than 2,000 years ago the first acts of what we now describe as 'terrorism' were perpetrated by religious fanatics,'' he writes. There were the Jewish Zealots, who fought against Rome in the first century, and Hindu Thugs, who strangled or otherwise murdered perhaps a million people during their seventh-century reign of terror.

In this century, terrorism has been more secular, deployed by groups with definite political objectives, usually independence. One of the most lethal terrorist acts of the 20th century, Hoffman reminds us, was the 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which killed 91 people and was perpetrated by the guerrilla organization fighting for a homeland for the Jews, under the command of a young Menachem Begin (a reminder that one person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter).

For its historical and political examination of terrorism, ''Inside Terrorism'' is a valuable work. Thus the publishers have done readers a disservice by producing a book that falls far short of what it could have been. Hoffman, until recently the director of the Center for Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, clearly cannot decide whether he is writing a book for a wide audience or for an academic readership -- repeated use of ''as we saw in Chapter . . .'' leaves us feeling like his students. And a diligent editor would have cleaned up his jarring misuse of parentheses to impart information, some of which is too important to be introduced as an aside and some of which should not have been included at all.
