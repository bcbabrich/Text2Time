What a difference four years make.

In the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, the candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee seemed to take every chance to disparage each another. Each took potshots at the other’s stands on the issues and their track records. Once, Mr. Romney even criticized Mr. Huckabee, who upended Mr. Romney’s plans to win the Iowa caucuses with a surprise victory, for his diction.

But on Saturday night, when Mr. Huckabee, now a Fox News host, interviewed his former rival on his show about Mr. Romney’s 2012 campaign, things were different. They sat smiling and occasionally offering compliments. They were polite.

For some perspective, here is a representative television appearance by the two from 2008 campaign. (The captions are not by The New York Times.)

On Saturday, Mr. Huckabee, who is not running for president this year, said to his guest that many viewers had tuned in wondering, “Would you and I be able to sit in the same room and be civil to each other?”

“I think we’ve proven that people can be civil.”

And that was, perhaps, because Mr. Huckabee seemed to pull some of the punches that might have been irresistible four years ago.

At one point, Mr. Romney replied to an abortion-rights question by saying he believed that life began at conception, and he spoke of his desire to see the United States Supreme Court’s landmark abortion rights decision, Roe v. Wade, overturned. Immediately afterward, he seemed to draw less of a hard line, saying he would leave the decision to permit the procedure up to the states.

In response, Mr. Huckabee likened that approach to the conditions in the country before the Civil War, but he just as quickly abandoned that idea.

Four years ago, Mr. Huckabee, who opposes abortion rights, frequently used Mr. Romney’s less-stringent stance as ammunition, and framed Mr. Romney’s view as “flip-flopping.”

But there were smiles and cordiality on Saturday night. Mr. Romney even asked Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, why he had not entered the fray this year. (His response was that he could not run and also continue his television show.) Mr. Romney went so far as to say it would have been “terrific” if Mr. Huckabee had once again run.
