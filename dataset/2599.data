Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider what they believe is the perfect ice cream sundae.

2. Examine the sophisticated intricacies of ice cream sundaes by reading and discussing the article “Accessorizing the Scoops of Summer.”

Resources / Materials:

-resources for researching ice cream and related topics (health and economics textbooks, computers with Internet access)

-large pieces of construction paper or poster board (optional)

-markers (optional)

-video camera (optional)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “Write a description of the perfect ice cream sundae. Also sketch a picture, if desired. What ice cream flavor(s) would you use? What other ingredients would you include? What type of bowl or cone would you put it in?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers.

2. As a class, read and discuss “Accessorizing the Scoops of Summer,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What culture created the sundae?

b. According to the article, what “world” do sundaes occupy?

c. When should adults indulge in an ice cream sundae?

d. What part of a sundae can be improved upon in one’s own kitchen?

e. Which flavors of ice cream should be used as a sundae’s foundation?

f. How does the article describe the consistency of ice cream at its optimal sundae temperature?

g. What are the two spheres of sundae sauces?

h. What effect does hot fudge, marshmallow, caramel and butterscotch sauces have on ice cream?

i. What ingredients can be used to make hot fudge sauce?

j. What ingredients make up both caramel and butterscotch sauces?

k. What flavor ice cream does marshmallow sauce compliment best?

m. According to the article, what is the proper sequence for a sundae?

n. What does a sundae need besides ice cream and sauce?

o. What metaphor(s) does the article provide for an ice cream sundae?

3. Divide students into six groups. Explain that the class will be preparing a news magazine program celebrating ice cream. Assign each group an ice cream-related topic to research, such as History, Types and Products, Processes and Recipes, Alternatives (lactose free, tofu-based, “Dippin’ Dots,” etc.), Economics and Nutritional Facts. Encourage students to use each other for polling and survey information if they plan to include opinions in their portion of the presentation. To guide their search for factual information, students may use the following questions (written on the board prior to class for easier student access):

HISTORY

-When was ice cream invented?

-How was ice cream originally made?

-What historical or cultural significance does ice cream have?

-How has technology influenced the creation and development of ice cream?

TYPES AND PRODUCTS

-What are the most common types of ice cream?

-What are popular ways to serve ice cream?

-What are some foods that are used to accompany or decorate ice cream?

-What are the various forms sold in your local supermarket? Choose your favorites or most popular and highlight them in your news segment.

-What gadgets or tools are associated with ice cream?

PROCESSES AND RECIPES

-How is milk turned into heavy cream?

-How is ice cream mass-produced?

-How would you make ice cream in your own home? (Explain the ice-cream maker process, if necessary.)

-What would a sample ice cream recipe look like?

ALTERNATIVE FORMS

-Why do ice cream alternatives exist?

-What non-dairy ice cream forms are currently mass produced?

-Where are these forms sold?

-How do each of these alternate forms compare to real ice cream? (Conduct a taste test or survey, and tally the results for your portion of the presentation.)

ECONOMICS

-What is the current price of milk per gallon? How does the cost of milk impact the price of ice cream?

-How much does a pint of ice cream cost on average? Examine several brands and list the range.

-How much does it cost a particular company to make a pint of ice cream? How does this number compare to the price a consumer pays in the supermarket?

-How large is the ice cream industry in the United States? How much did the industry gross last year? Five years ago? How many ice cream stores are located in the United States?

-Who are the chief manufacturers of ice cream?

NUTRITIONAL FACTS

-Under what food group does ice cream fit?

-How large is a “single serving” of ice cream?

-What are the basic ingredients necessary to make ice cream? For each ingredient, analyze its nutritional and caloric value.

-How have companies changed the ingredients of ice cream to meet the health and dietary needs of consumers?

-Compare the ingredients of the same ice cream flavor made by two different companies, such as Breyers, Turkey Hill, Ben & Jerry’s, Hood, etc.

Once research is completed, groups should work to prepare scripts and visuals for their assigned segment for a news magazine program celebrating ice cream. Scripts can be rehearsed and performed for a live news program, or taped and viewed in a future class.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students create public service announcements promoting ice cream consumption. Encourage students to consider the information they researched during class to create their assignments, as well as their own personal beliefs about ice cream. Who will be the target audience for the announcement? Where will the ads air? In a future class, students may share their creations with peers.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What does it mean to say that sundaes are “as messy and as irresistible as democracy itself”?

–What ingredients do you like to use in your sundaes?

–What is the strangest sundae topping you have ever tried or seen someone else try? Why is it so strange?

–When preparing an ice cream snack at home, do you consider the temperature of the ice cream or its presentation? Why or why not?

–How, if at all, has this article changed your views about sundaes?

–Besides those ingredients listed in the article, what else would provide a good crunchy texture for a sundae?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, participation in class and group discussions, thorough completion of research, visuals and scripts, and thoughtful creation of public service announcements.

5. The tone and choice of words for the article “Accessorizing the Scoops of Summer” are poetic as well as descriptive. Imitating the writing style of the article, describe an item of your choice.

6. Compile a list of metaphors for summer. Choose your favorite and create a collage illustrating its meaning.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts- Create a collage celebrating ice cream that focuses on a quotation said by a famous person about the icy dessert. Quotations can be found at the Official Web Site of the Ice Cream Sundae at //www.icecreamsundae.com/whosaidwhat.html.

Global Studies- Create an ice cream sundae recipe reflecting the foods and tastes of a particular culture. As an example, look at a Mexican-influenced sundae at //www.gourmetsleuth.com/chocolatecajetasundaes.htm.

Health

-Research and add a health component to the ice cream program created in class. What are connections between ice cream consumption and heart disease, obesity, diabetes, etc.?

-Chart the similarities and differences between two diet programs, such as Atkins and South Beach. What is the basis for each program? What types of foods are allowed, particularly with regard to desserts? Which foods are restricted? Which one seems easier or more realistic to follow?

Science

-Create a “How it Works” poster about the human tongue. Explain how taste buds function and where different tastes can be experienced.

-Write a pamphlet entitled “Smart Sugar Guide” to help consumers learn about sugar and their diets. What are the different types of sugars? How much sugar does the human body need? What impact does sugar have on your body? How does the human body utilize sugar? In scientific terms, what is a “sugar rush”? Where do you find sugar in your diet?
