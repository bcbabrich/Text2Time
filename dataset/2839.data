To the Editor:

Maureen Dowd (column, Oct. 30) says, ''After admitting recently that Saddam had no connection to 9/11, the president pounded his finger on his lectern on Tuesday, while vowing to stay in Iraq, and said, 'We must never forget the lessons of Sept. 11.' ''

I took the main lesson of 9/11 to be that terror and tyranny are to be tolerated nowhere or we will find it everywhere. A direct connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 is irrelevant. He was a genocidal supporter of world terrorism. We've deposed him; now we have to finish routing his supporters so that the Iraqi people can rebuild and live in freedom.
