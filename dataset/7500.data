SANTIAGO, Chile, Sept. 30—The incoming Government of President‐elect Eduardo Frei Montalva has opened far‐reaching conversations with two United States copper companies with a view to an agreement that could set a new pattern for the development of mineral resources in Latin America on a joint Government‐private industry basis.

Qualified sources disclosed today that key advisers of Mr. Frei were meeting separately with top officials of the Anaconda Company and the Cerro Corporation to prepare for formal negotiations expected to begin shortly after Mr. Frei is proclaimed President by Congress on Oct. 20. He will take office on Nov. 4.

The Chilean negotiating team is headed by Javier Lagar‐ ruigue, a world‐known copper expert and trusted adviser of the President‐elect who has previously served as head of the Chilean Copper Department and is almost certain to resume that post in the new Government.

Charles M. Brinckerhoff, chief executive officer of Anaconda; C. Jay Parkinson, president, and Thomas Campbell, a vice president, have been here for several days, but their activities have been held in great reserve.
