AT&T, the second largest American phone carrier, on Saturday said it would offer a cheaper phone plan for families with multiple devices. It was AT&T’s latest big move amid intense competition coming from rivals, especially T-Mobile US.

Under the new plan, AT&T is offering families unlimited minutes, unlimited texting and 10 gigabytes of data to share among themselves. The price for monthly service depends on the number of phone lines in the family. A family of two can pay $130 a month, a family of three can pay $145, a family of four can pay $160 and any additional line after that will cost an extra $15.

But then there’s the fine print with the new family plan. Customers who are brand-new to AT&T either have to sign up for AT&T’s Next program, which allows the customer to spread payments of the device over up to 26 months; bring their own device; or pay for the full price of the phone. For example, for the cheapest iPhone 5S, a customer can pay the full $650 for the phone, or pay $25 a month for 26 months on top of the cost of the new family plan, or bring his or her own iPhone 5S (assuming it is compatible with AT&T’s network).

So the new family plan may be more expensive than some of AT&T’s other plans if each family member chooses a high-end smartphone. But it can be a good deal for families where at least a few people — like the children — choose cheaper smartphones.

When existing AT&T customers switch to the new family plan, they won’t have to immediately jump to the Next program or pay the full cost of the phone. But once their contract is up and they want to upgrade to a new device, they will have to choose one of those options.

Overall, the new family plan is an aggressive offering. T-Mobile has been offering family plans with a similar structure, but it allows each family member to choose the amount of data he or she wants individually. A family of four where each person wants 2.5 gigabytes a month would cost $140 a month, not including the monthly cost of each device.

Jan Dawson, a telecom analyst for Jackdaw Research, said AT&T’s new family plan was a sign that it was shifting toward relying on data plans to increase its revenue.

“AT&T and Verizon will continue to try to attract new customers, but they can grow strongly by growing usage and growing the number of devices per account without necessarily adding huge numbers of new customers,” Mr. Dawson said. “That becomes all the more important as the market becomes saturated and there are few new customers to go around.”
