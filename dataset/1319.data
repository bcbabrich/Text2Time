So much has happened over the past few months. My feelings throughout this crazy milestone we call the college admissions process have changed entirely so many times that it’s difficult to keep track of them all.

I started as an overwhelmed sophomore, then transformed into a generally apprehensive junior. This year, I began by experiencing myriad emotions, all with varying degrees of pleasantness, and some suspiciously similar to the Five Stages of Grief. Everything from stress, sadness, and frustration to excitement, joy, and, ultimately, acceptance.

As time goes on, and the whole crazy concept of moving out, going to college, and (gasp!) growing up looms closer, I become less and less preoccupied with the fears and ecstasies of getting into all of my colleges, and more pleased with the idea that, no matter what, I’m in. I am going to college.

My nerves have been assuaged by developments over the past couple of months. First, I was accepted to USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering, and offered its Presidential Scholarship, worth $21,080 each year. In addition to that, the program has repeatedly sent me packets of information and offers to apply to their various honors programs. Of course, this is no guarantee that I would be accepted into any of them, but I am grateful that USC has made that offer.

Beyond that, my Mom and I finished the Fafsa on time, albeit narrowly. Though relatively simple to fill out, the need to finish it has been nagging at both of our minds for awhile, and it is a relief to have it out of the way.

I also received news that I have been selected as a National Merit Finalist based on my PSAT score, as well as an essay and SAT scores that I had to submit to the National Merit Scholarship Corporation back in September. The award opens up new scholarship opportunities for me. I still need to do some research on the colleges that offer scholarships for National Merit, but the sums offered from many of them are considerable.

However, as with most things in life, my good news is accompanied by disappointing news. MIT announced its admissions decisions — on Pi Day, March 14, at 9:26 p.m. — which, if you include the fact that my class will graduate in 2015, yields 3.1415926.

I think it’s cute in a nerdy kind of way. Or, at least, I did until I read their decision.

My initial reaction was numbness, followed shortly by a vague sense of having been insulted. However, as reason returned, I had to remember that its pool of applicants is both large and extremely talented, and that I ought not take it personally. Besides, chocolate and good friends are the best sort of medicine for college heartbreak.

My vexation over MIT was alleviated upon receiving further good news. I was accepted to Case Western, and offered a scholarship there worth $17,000 annually, which is about half of its tuition. Finally, I received word from Cornell University, saying that I am accepted there, too. I still have to wait for the admissions packet in the mail, as well as any word about financial aid, but I’m glad for the acceptance itself.

I stress the scholarships (and their respective amounts) here because of the extreme importance of these factors in my final college decision. Even with financial aid, many of the schools that I’m considering are still very expensive. The estimated cost, including room and board, books, and tuition for a year at USC is $55,728, according to the College Board.

The full fees for Cornell, Yale, and Carnegie Mellon are similar, so naturally, my family and I are hoping for some assistance. Getting accepted to an elite school is not the only obstacle to actually being able to go there. On the bright side, however, most Ivy League and otherwise highly selective schools are aware that many of their applicants are in this situation. Consequently, many of them offer generous need-based scholarships.

As I approach the culmination of these past few years of stress and excitement, I feel almost as confounded as when I began, but for different reasons. Where I initially had no idea where to even begin looking to apply, I have already heard back from every school but (as I write this) Yale and Carnegie Mellon.

Now the trouble is weighing the costs and benefits of each school (its distance from home, its price, its programs…) and deciding which of them will truly work for me. So now my quandary, while much less frenetic than it was earlier in the year, is no less difficult to work through. Wish me luck.
