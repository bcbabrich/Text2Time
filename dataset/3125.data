The next chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said today that it was highly unlikely that missile defenses would be fielded in President Bush's current term, and should not be deployed at all until repeated tests proved their effectiveness.

The senator, Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said he was confident that the nation had both the treasury and technology for missile defenses. But he predicted that diplomatic battles over the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and the scientific hurdles meant ''the odds are against'' deployment by the end of 2004.

''I don't think the technology is likely to develop fast enough, even if he decided to violate the treaty,'' Mr. Levin said, referring to Mr. Bush, in an interview. ''And I think our European allies have responded with caution and concern to such a degree that the president is going to have to look again at the complexities of the issue.''

In the interview, Mr. Levin laid out his agenda -- and therefore that of the Senate's new leadership -- on military affairs. He emphasized that he would not occupy himself solely with the high-profile issues of strategic nuclear posture and billion-dollar weapons systems, but would focus on improving pay, health care and housing for those in uniform. He also said he would try to modernize the Pentagon's purchasing practices and push for another round of base closings to save money.
