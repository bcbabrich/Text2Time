Roughly one-quarter of the legislators from New York City and other areas served by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were absent Tuesday when the State Legislature voted to approve a financing package to rebuild the mass-transit system.

No one has suggested that the outcome would have been different if the missing legislators had been present. The plan passed by a large margin in both houses. But citizen groups and others were critical.

''They figured the votes were there to pass what needed to be passed,'' said Paul H. Elisha, executive director of the New York State branch of Common Cause, a citizen advocacy group. ''But at a time when there's a great deal of discussion about raises for legislators, a full-time Legislature, the whole manner in which this special session was handled shows a very cavalier attitude on the part of legislators to the needs of the constituents. One would hope that that's not a bellwether for the year to come.'' #30 Absentees Recorded Of the 40 state senators who represent the 12-county area served by the M.T.A., 11 were officially listed as absent or ''excused.'' And in the Assembly, which has 94 members whose districts fall within the M.T.A. service area, 19 members were similarly listed.

The counties served by the M.T.A. include the five of New York City, as well as Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Putnam.
