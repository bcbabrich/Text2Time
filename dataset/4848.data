In another statement, the First Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, Col. Gen. Bronislav A. Omelichev, said the military was already looking for "suitable measures" to complement the American initiative, but he also had no time frame.

General Omelichev told Tass that nuclear weapons on a given republic's territory were not the property of that republic. "This is the property of the armed forces and them alone," he said. "Only the Defense Ministry has the right to control tactical or any other nuclear weapons. Naturally, by the decision of the supreme state leadership." Seeking More Time

The question of control over Soviet nuclear weapons is one of the critical issues behind President Bush's initiative. Washington evidently hopes that the Soviets will use the American lead to withdraw tactical nuclear weapons scattered among republics that are increasingly free of central control and often increasingly unstable.

There was speculation that Mr. Gorbachev is seeking more time for a response because he needs to consult with leaders of the republics before issuing one. Mr. Gorbachev formally shares power in a State Council with leaders of participating republics. Since the aborted coup last month, most Soviet republics have declared independence, and Mr. Gorbachev's authority has become effectively dependent on the consent of the republics' leaders, in particular President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federation.

Mr. Petrovsky pointed to this fact when he said that the Soviet position would be "coordinated" with those of the republics in the planned consultations with the United States. He said this had already become the practice at the Foreign Ministry.

The Bush initiative confronts Mr. Gorbachev when he is struggling to salvage at least some form of union in negotiations with the republics, and in his comments today the President suggested that the going was hard.

He said he was continuing to demand that the agreement be on a "union of sovereign states, a union state, and not of some amorphous formation." Unless this position is accepted, he declared, "I will immediately leave office, since without integration the country is threatened with collapse. This is a fatal course, and I will not link myself to such an approach."
