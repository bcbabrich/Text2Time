Gary Kasparov won the World Championship Chess Match last night against Anatoly Karpov by drawing the 24th and final game in Lyons, France.

The final score of the match, which began on Oct. 8 in Manhattan, was 12 1/2-11 1/2. Kasparov, 27 years old, had already clinched a tie and retained his title last week. In a tie, the $3 million prize money would have been split, although Kasparov would have kept the world title he won from Karpov in 1985. But by winning, Kasparov won $1.7 million and a diamond-studded trophy. Karpov, 39, won $1.3 million.

Although Karpov will have to win the right to challenge Kasparov again in 1993, they are clearly the world's best and second-best players. In 144 games that the Soviet grandmasters have played in five world title matches, Kasparov is ahead by only 2.

After losing the previous game, the champion played as conservatively as he knew how. He shifted from the belligerent 1 e4 openings that he had used throughout this series to the more solid English Opening. Karpov did his best to try to create complications, but that was difficult when his opponent, as White, moved first. In the final position, which was heavily in Kasparov's favor, the champion offered a draw and Karpov had little choice but to accept. Quiet, Positional Opening
