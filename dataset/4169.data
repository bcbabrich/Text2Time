Serge Tchuruk, chairman of the French oil company Total S.A., told shareholders at the company's annual meeting today that he had decided to accept an offer to lead Alcatel Alsthom S.A., the giant French conglomerate.

Alcatel, which has interests in telecommunications, transportation and energy, said Tuesday evening that it had offered the positions of chairman and chief executive to Mr. Tchuruk, who is 57. He will take the positions on June 22, replacing Pierre Suard, who was forced to step down in April because of fraud and corruption charges against him.

Alcatel investors reacted enthusiastically to the news. Alcatel's shares rose 3.2 percent in Paris today, to 451.80 French francs from 438 on Tuesday. The level on Tuesday itself represented a 3.8 percent gain from Monday as speculation grew that Mr. Tchuruk would take the job.

Alcatel had named Marc Vienot, the chairman of the bank Societe Generale, as interim chairman in April with a brief to find a successor to Mr. Suard. People close to Mr. Vienot said he had been impressed by Mr. Tchuruk's record at Total, where he was chairman for five years.
