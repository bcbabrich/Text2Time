A seasonal reminder is in order now, although I don't want to get bossy about it, hectoring people to send off their bulb orders before they draw another breath. The time to admire tulips in their great splendor is many months away, but the time to think tulips is upon us already.

When I think tulips, recalling springs past, two distinct images collide in my mind. One we might call the civic tulip or the public tulip, by which I mean an overpowering display of tulips en masse, a succession of rectangular beds, each given to one cultivar only. Such a spectacle - and there's probably not an example in America seen by more people than the tulip plantings in the middle of Park Avenue - testifies with enormous force to the achievements wrought by hybridizers in Holland since the early 16th century.

As Martin Rix tells it in his fascinating book, ''Growing Bulbs'' (Timber Press, 1983), when Suleiman the Magnificent reigned in Turkey, his ambassador to the court of Ferdinand I in Vienna, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, introduced to the West the wild tulips and other bulbs that grew in the gardens of Istanbul. Interest in these flamboyant early spring flowers grew to great heights. After the strange horticultural and economic phenomenon in the 1630's known as tulipomania, when whole fortunes could be won or lost on just one bulb, the speculative bubble broke. The Dutch then got down to more sensible transactions with tulips, growing and breeding them to increase the height of their stems, the size of their flowers, and the range of their radiant colors.

The result is the modern hybrid tulip. There are many classes - Darwin hybrids, cottage tulips, peony-flowered tulips and so on. So many hundreds of named cultivars are available in commerce that browsing through a bulb catalog, with its many colorful pictures of tulips , can lead to paralysis of choice. But the choice almost doesn't matter. Who has ever seen a really ugly tulip (except for those monstrosities touted for their supposed resemblance to parrots)?
