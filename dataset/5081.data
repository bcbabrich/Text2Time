Du Pont is ingrained here. It built this place - invented it, admirers say - at the height of the Cold War, after President Harry S. Truman told the company's chairman that the giant chemical concern, a military contractor since the time of the Revolution, was best qualified for the job. Describing the job at the time as ''probably the largest industrial project ever attempted,'' Du Pont agreed to do it for costs plus one dollar.

But for a decade engineers and scientists have worried about the age of the reactors, and in recent months the Department of Energy has expressed dismay about worker attitudes, pollution and the condition of equipment.

Now Du Pont has decided to quit, reasoning that in the nuclear industry that has grown up since work started here, others now have more expertise. But the departure is a bit like the mustering out of a Vietnam veteran, whose sacrifice is respected but whose work, at the end, is a subject of ambivalence. No Applause

''There is no applause from the Department of Energy, and we expect none,'' said James E. Conaway, who came here with Du Pont in 1951 and is now director of manufacturing for its Atomic Energy Division, at a dinner gathering of the ''25-Year Club'' recently. ''Gratitude is perhaps the most fragile human emotion.''

When the country asked for help, he said, ''we did it well.''

''We know it,'' he went on. ''Our families know it, and our communities know it. As far as I am concerned, nobody else counts.''

In an interview, he stressed that despite the risks postulated by various engineers and occasional accidents over the years, the record was perfect. No one, he said, had been injured by radiation here. Workers were exposed to radiation, in routine operations and in cleaning up after accidents, but the exposures were within government limits, Du Pont officials say.

Department of Energy officials are reluctant to talk in detail about the performance of their long-trusted contractor, in part because it reflects poorly on the department's supervision and because the same employees will be doing the work next week.
