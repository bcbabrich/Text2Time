To the Editor:

Contrary to what William Saletan charges (''What's the Value of a Fetus?,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 26), abortion rights supporters do not treat the fetus ''as nothing.'' We do not recognize the fetus at all, because there is no one fetus.

There are many fetuses, and they do not have equal value.

The distinction is crucial, because the value of fetuses depends on the varied circumstances of pregnancy.

One fetus results from contraceptive failure and is aborted with a mixture of reluctance and relief. Another fetus, despite being desired and planned, is inexplicably miscarried, causing unmitigated sorrow. Other fetuses live to be born. These were my fetuses.

I will not face the grim decision about what to do when a pregnancy threatens my life. But some other woman will. With the banning of so-called partial birth abortion, she will learn that the law now values her fetus over her own life.
