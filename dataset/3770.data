With the Patriots coming off a 6-10 season in 1995, Parcells wanted to negotiate his way out of the final year of his contract with New England. Kraft, using the foresight of Nostradamus, negotiated away the final year, but kept his hammer in place. Parcells was rejuvenated during the season and wanted to continue coaching, but not in New England for Kraft.

Parcells didn't want to deal in hypotheticals at his news conference in Foxboro Stadium yesterday, but while he's not looking, let's toss one out.

Let's say Parcells does indeed land with the Jets and they make a huge leap next season and finish 8-8. Then, the following season, for whatever reason, they slip to 6-10. What happens if he looks at the horizon and all he can see is another 6-10 in a very competitive A.F.C. East division?

Remember, Parcells is going to have to deal with the Super Bowl contender that he built in New England. He'll see Curtis Martin, Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn and Ben Coates (all scorned players) twice a year. Do you think Jimmy Johnson is down in Miami sitting on his boat, twiddling his thumbs? And just two years ago Indianapolis was in the A.F.C. championship game.

With the Jets being the N.F.L.'s version of ''This Old House,'' it will take months, maybe years, for Parcells to strip away those old layers of losing that have built up like so much varnish.

On the flip side, the No. 1 pick -- whether it's offensive lineman Orlando Pace or quarterback Peyton Manning -- might be a monumental bust. However, Pace might be the next Anthony Munoz.

Yes, Kraft has a big hammer over the Jets. But if he wants the No. 1 pick, let him keep his hammer, keep his ex-coach out of football for a year and get nothing. If nothing changes over the weekend, the Jets should hire Green Bay's offensive coordinator, Sherman Lewis, as quickly as possible, and let him decide which franchise player he wants to take with the No. 1 pick.
