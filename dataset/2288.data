On Tuesday, I moderated a panel at, of all things, the United Nations. It was pretty cool to sit down in a U.N. conference room, complete with those little earpiece thingies for hearing translations (although no translators were on duty–rats).

Anyway, the panel was all about free and open-source software and how it might benefit the U.N.’s member states. The panelists included six advocates of free software–for example, representatives from Novell, I.B.M. and Red Hat, all of whom have developed thriving consulting and support businesses around free software like Linux–and a Microsoft rep. He valiantly enunciated Microsoft’s current attitude toward the open-source movement: for example, that Microsoft welcomes and has learned from the competition, and that the market has plenty of room for both proprietary and free software.

What made things especially interesting was that only two seats away from him was Richard Stallman, the influential founder of the free software movement and a man who does not mince words.

Mr. Stallman does not like Microsoft. Wow, does he not. He mentioned that when the U.N. sent him the information about the panel in a Microsoft Word document, he refused it and requested a different format. During the panel, he called Microsoft evil, said that the U.S. government is in Microsoft’s pocket, and at one point faced the Microsoft guy and shouted, right there in the United Nations conference room, “You are a deceptive person!”

A good time was had by all.

Seriously, though, many countries (or departments within them) are already making the switch to open-source software. They save money up front because the software doesn’t cost anything, but there are other motivations, like security (they can inspect the source code) and, in some countries, the hope of generating jobs for local programmers and administrators.

If you believe the companies who are offering open-source packages–and not everyone does–the momentum is clearly on the free-software side, that the tide is turning, and even that the days of the proprietary-software monopoly are numbered.

As I mentioned at the end of the seminar: Let’s all meet back here in ten years and see how things turned out.
