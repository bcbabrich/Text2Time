Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-paper

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “Long Stifled, Iraqis Make Most of Chance to Vent on Talk Radio,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20040901wednesday.html (one per student)

-access to a news radio program (either taped prior to class, live on the radio or from a radio feed online)

-resources for researching global, national and local current events (newspapers, periodicals, computers with Internet access)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, teachers should set up a sample talk show for students to listen to while considering questions written on the board prior to class. Public radio feeds from a station such as National Public Radio (//www.npr.org) provide access to talk radio shows, such as the “Tavis Smiley Show,” “All Things Considered” and “Talk of the Nation.” As students enter the room, instruct them to listen to the audio clip as it is played, and then write in their journals in response to the following discussion questions (written on the board prior to class): “You are listening to a sample of a talk radio show. What is the format? What is the topic being discussed? Who are the various people talking on the air? What seems to be the purpose of the program?” After a few minutes, allow students to share their answers. How does talk radio differ from television talk programs? Who do you think listens to it? Why might a person choose to listen to talk radio?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Long Stifled, Iraqis Make Most of Chance to Vent on Talk Radio,” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20040901wednesday.html) focusing on the following questions:

a. What is Radio Dijla?

b. What types of people listen to this station?

c. How many calls, on average, does this station receive in an hour?

d. What topics do people call in about?

e. According to Haidar al-Ameen, why do the complaints of Iraqi citizens go unanswered?

f. How does the station involve the local and national government in its programs?

g. What issue was raised when local government leader Ali Laaibi was on the air?

h. Besides the frustrations of daily life, what other topic can people now speak publicly about?

i. What was the topic of a news program broadcast on June 30, 2004?

j. Under Saddam Hussein, what was the status of radio and radio stations?

k. What quality characterizes the staff at Radio Dijla?

l. What skills should Iraqis learn, according to Imad al-Sharaa?

m. What other types of programs are on this station?

n. Why is the late-night show about relationships considered “racy”?

3. Explain that students will work in pairs to co-host mock radio shows focusing on an issue of current interest to students in their school. As a class, generate a list of current concerns on the board, such as school uniforms, honor codes, the war in Iraq, global warming, etc., and then assign each pair a topic.

To prepare for the talk show, explain that each student in the pair should choose a position on the issue to research for the purpose of conducting an educated conversation from that point of view. (This viewpoint may or may not reflect the student’s true feelings about the issue. The important factor is that the student is informed and able to conduct an on-air debate with his or her “co-host” and field questions and comments from “callers.”) Questions to consider include, but are not limited to, the following (written on the board for easier student access): -What is the topic or issue you are researching?

-What are the various positions on this topic?

-Which position related to this topic will you be taking on your mock talk show program?

-How long has this topic been an issue?

-Who is most affected by this issue? Why?

-What people or groups are involved in this issue? Which ones have, or have the potential to have, the most power to bring about change with respect to this issue?

-What types of changes or solutions could be developed and implemented?

Once research is completed, students should organize their research onto note cards for easy access during their mock news radio shows. Students should consider the information they want to present on their specific position and on related topics, as well as prepare for possible questions that “callers” (members of the class or audience) may ask them while “on the air.”

Additionally, students may want to create titles for their talk shows and scripts to introduce their topics, as well as share with their co-hosts the viewpoints they have prepared to present.

In a future class, groups perform their mock talk shows on their assigned subjects and invite “callers” (classmates) to make comments and ask questions. Once presentations are completed, the class should evaluate which hosts and callers were most effective.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students write reflection papers examining the importance of forums for public expression. Which forums are most valuable? Why? Which are most accessible, and to whom? Why? Other topics to reflect on: their experiences as talk show hosts; personal opinions about talk radio shows; whether they would feel comfortable calling in to a ‘real’ show; etc.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-How did Saddam Hussein control the media in Iraq?

-Why did the Swedish government take an interest in helping to start Radio Dilja?

-Why is education a valued quality in democratic societies?

-What happens when people are not allowed to voice their opinions?

-How do you make your own opinions heard? Do you feel these are meaningful, productive avenues for you? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in initial class discussion and subsequent conversations, research, presentation of mock talk shows and thoughtfully written reflection papers.

Vocabulary:

stifled, vent, insurgency, merit, persist, sewage, taint, royalty, supplicants, frantic, executed, insurgency, roiled, interim, censored, hejabs, optimism, repression, clerics, racy, adherence, betrayal

Extension Activities:

1. Choose a pressing domestic issue that has surfaced in Iraq since Saddam Hussein’s regime ended. Research one of these issues, such as garbage disposal or water contamination, and write an article explaining the current issue, its history and its future status.

2. Create a plan for a one-hour, commercial-free radio music show. What would your play list be? What topics would you discuss? What types of introductions or comments would you make? Present your plan to the class, including a short sample.

3. Write a position paper examining the importance of the media and the information it disseminates in democratic nations, and consider the effect of censorship in such countries as Russia, China, Cuba or Iraq. Why do dictatorships fight so hard to control information?

4. Research the most popular local radio stations. What types of programs do they offer? Why do you think these stations are so popular in your community? Create a poster illustrating your findings. Include suggestions for new radio stations, if you believe a population or need is not being served by the current choices available.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics – Research the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), taking into consideration a controversial issue that involved this organization (such as the Janet Jackson scandal at the 2004 Super Bowl or Rush Limbaugh’s ESPN commentary about race in football), and write a research paper about your findings. How does the FCC operate? Who runs it? Does the FCC seem to have a political leaning? What impact does the FCC have on radio and television coverage?

Geography – Create a topographical map of Iraq, highlighting the major geographical features that have shaped this nation.

Health – Design a presentation illustrating the benefits of talking and speaking your mind. Examine various forums for expression, including support groups, hotlines, chat rooms, psychologists, etc.

Technology -Create a “How it Works” poster explaining how a radio station operates.

-According to the article, “The station [Radio Dijla] receives an average of 185 calls an hour, far more than it can handle ….” How many calls can a phone line handle? What determines phone line capacity? What services can a phone company offer a business that has a high call volume? What types of phone systems are necessary? How are calls answered? Put on hold? Write a brief report about your findings.

Teaching with The Times – Clip the letters to the editor on the editorial page of The New York Times for a week. What topics and articles are the published letters about? What viewpoints are represented? How do the letter writers identify themselves? How does The Times compare with the radio talk shows you listened to as a forum for public expression?
