Edward F. Kook, the founder and longtime president of the Century Lighting Company, which brightened more than 1,000 Broadway plays, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. His death, at the age of 87, was caused by a heart attack, a family spokesman said.

Mr. Kook (pronounced cook) was a major behind-the-scenes theater figure for 40 years. He received a 1952 Tony award and the 1962 Kelcey Allen Award for long and devoted service to the theater. He founded and managed Century Lighting in Manhattan, from 1929 to 1968, personally supervising the design, manufacture and popularization of many innovations in lighting instruments, effects and controls in theaters, opera houses and television studios in the United States, Canada, Europe and South America. He sold the company in 1964 to the Progress Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia, which renamed it the Lighting Corporation of America, but he stayed on to aid the transition.

George C. Izenouer, a leading inventor of lighting systems, worked closely with Mr. Kook for 44 years in developing increasingly sophisticated devices. He said yesterday, from his home in Connecticut, ''I was the inventor and engineer, and he was the entrepreneur who made it all possible.''

Hours Cut to Seconds

A major breakthrough was their installation of the first electronic lighting control system in a professional theater in New York, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center in the mid-1960's. With the system, hours of rehearsal time formerly required for recording a given lighting cut were reduced to seconds.
