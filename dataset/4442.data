As they gained a clearer sense of the obstacles they face, from the lack of heat to the 1.8 million gallons of water in the basement, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday that it would be more than a week before they fully revive what amount to the heart, lungs and nervous system of the World Trade Center.

Last night, the heating, ventilation, communication and fire alarm systems of the massive complex were still dead. The Vista Hotel, perched on slender columns above the blast area, was still unsecured -- although engineers said they had assembled all the materials and plans they needed to begin the job by yesterday morning.

As the 35-foot steel tubes they planned to use to support the columns sat in a pile near the Vista Hotel, engineers waited for a go-ahead from investigators, who had cordoned off the area of the explosion as a crime scene. Yesterday evening, Eugene Fasullo, the Port Authority's chief engineer, said he had not yet received permission to begin the job, which could take two days, although he expected it at any time.

In most of the complex, communications, ventilation, air-conditioning, heating and fire and smoke alarm systems themselves were not damaged, but their "nerve center" was destroyed, said Robert DiChiara, assistant director of the World Trade Department of the Port Authority.
