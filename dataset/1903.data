The northeast corner of Tompkins Square Park has handball courts, where shirtless men were smacking a blue rubber ball and taunting one another Wednesday afternoon, and a sandy dog run, where purebreds of all shapes and sizes were rolling around, jumping up and nipping at each other’s ears under their owners’ watchful eyes.

That was the scene in front of the Christodora House, on Avenue B, on a humid afternoon almost 20 years after a riot, involving police and protesters, that shook the East Village neighborhood.

The anniversary of the riot, which was preceded by months of tension and followed by months more of the same, is actually late next Wednesday night and early Thursday morning. Among the commemorative events planned is a punk rock concert.

To get the opinions of people who were there, I called some current and former residents of the Christodora, an expensive high-rise on Avenue B that became a symbol of the neighborhood’s gentrification and still attracts the ire of some protesters. Some of their recollections are in the Dispatches feature, in this Sunday’s City section, including Michael Rosen, who said the building’s residents have done a lot for the neighborhood. He and his wife informally adopted five underprivileged teenagers in the neighborhood.

Another is Lesley Hazleton, an author who was secretary of the building’s board before moving to Seattle in 1992. Ms. Hazleton, who believes the building’s residents were unfairly criticized, and the era improperly romanticized, e-mailed to me some recollections from the time. She wrote, in part:

I remember the time in general rather than in specifics, though I do have a very clear image of a homeless guy with feces all over him — animal or human? — picking up orange after orange at the corner grocery and putting them back again. That was when ambulances were taking bodies out of the park many nights — OD or violence or the new drug-resistant strain of TB. I remember the trust-fund radicals loudly claiming to represent “the people” — a “people” which evidently did not include the majority black and Latino population of the neighborhood who could no longer walk through the park, let alone let their kids use it, for all the used needles on the ground, the casual violence, and the crack whores doing their thing in plain view.

A less sympathetic view of the Christodora House and its residents, reflecting the continuing push-and-pull over gentrification, offers details of a recent protest that wound up outside the building, including the use of the slogan “Die yuppie scum,” coined during the era and frequently used to this day.

Part of the building’s symbolic value in the neighborhood stems from its history: for decades it was home to social service and community organizations, and it was converted to condominiums, complete with a doorman and an elevator, just a few years before the 1988 riots.

In what was a relatively impoverished neighborhood, the Christodora made an easy, and obvious, target. During the riot, protesters smashed in the front door and threw debris into the building. Meanwhile, police efforts to stop the rioting resulted in episodes of brutality against protesters, journalists and innocent bystanders captured on film and in eyewitness accounts.

A couple of decades later, it was hard to reconcile those events with the scene this week in the park, filled with a diverse mix of people. There were old women fanning themselves on the benches, people lying in the grass to read, a man strumming an acoustic guitar at a beaming baby, and some homeless people, many of whom were listening intently to a street preacher.

The biggest disturbance came from a man riding a large, red, custom-made tricycle with a boom box embedded in the back, which was blaring the Inner Circle song “Bad Boys” as he cruised by. People looked up, smiled, then went back to what they were doing.
