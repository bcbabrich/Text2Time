Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students consider why photographs in space might not show stars and research the importance of light in this phenomenon. They then research other scientific processes related to light or its absence and create “How It Works” posters about them. Finally, students further examine the idea of light pollution and write persuasive paragraphs supporting their views.

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Generate reasons for why a photograph taken in space might not show stars.

2. Learn the scientific explanation for the missing stars in space photographs by reading and discussing “Seeing Stars.”

3. Research other light-dependent or light-independent processes; create and present “How It Works” posters about these processes.

4. Further explore the concept of light pollution; share their views in persuasive paragraphs.

Resources / Materials:

-photograph taken in space in which no stars are visible (optional)

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “Seeing Stars” (one per student)

-resources about light-dependent and light-independent scientific processes (computers with Internet access, library resources, encyclopedias, science textbooks, etc.)

-crayons/markers (enough for students to share)

-poster board (one piece per small group)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, if available, post on the board, on a transparency or otherwise make visible to students a photograph taken in space in which no stars are visible. Upon entering class, students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “In some photographs taken by astronauts in space, stars are not visible. Some people believe that this is proof that these photographs have been faked. However, scientists believe there is an explanation for the missing stars. What do you believe, and why?” After a few minutes, allow students to share their responses. Then discuss the following as a class: Under what conditions are stars visible? Why is it more difficult to see stars in the city than in the countryside? How might this relate to the space photograph situation?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Seeing Stars,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What explanation is given for why stars are often not seen in photographs taken by astronauts in space or when on airplanes flying at night?

b. How might you make stars visible during your next airplane night flight?

c. Why were the cameras used by the astronauts in 1969 unlikely to capture any stars?

3. Create two columns on the board, one titled “Light-Dependent” and the other titled “Light-Independent.” As a class, brainstorm in these columns a list of scientific processes that require light and another list of scientific processes that do not require light. Student responses may include, but are not limited to, photosynthesis, vitamin D, tanning, color vision, and solar light (in the light-dependent column), and sonar, radar, troglobites (cave dwellers), x-rays, and night-vision (in the light-independent column).

Divide students into small groups of two or three students each, and allow each group to choose a light-dependent or light-independent process listed on the board. Using all available resources, each group should research their process and create a “How It Works” poster which adheres to the following guidelines (written on the board for easier student access):

–Include a picture of the process examined by your group, labeled as necessary.

–Provide an explanation of why the process is light-dependent or light-independent.

–Identify the types of organisms or technologies that utilize the process.

–Describe consequences if more or less light is added to the process.

Students should complete their posters at home or in a future class. After each group is finished, students should present their posters with their classmates and post them in the classroom.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students respond to the following assignment, written on the board for them to copy prior to leaving class: “Examine what is meant by the term ‘light pollution.’ Generate a list of benefits and drawbacks to electric lights, and interview at least three people about how important they think electric lights are and how important they feel it is to avoid light pollution. Then, write a persuasive paragraph summarizing your beliefs about light pollution.”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is a “conspiracy theorist”? Why might such a person want to consider the moon landing a hoax?

–What is a star?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, thoughtful participation in class discussions, cooperation in small groups, accuracy in research about light-dependent and light-independent processes, and thoughtful and thorough “how it works” posters on those processes.

Vocabulary:

faint, celestial, interior, lunar, cited, conspiracy, theorists, persists, routine, wavelengths

Extension Activities:

1. Create a “How It Works” poster about the human eye, explaining how light and dark are regulated by rods and cones.

2. Imagine that you are a third party arbitrator who is trying to resolve a dispute between a power plant that requires 24-hour lighting and a local community that is fighting light pollution. Draw up a proposal for a compromise between the two parties. Consider some of the suggestions provided by a light pollution awareness group (//members.aol.com/ctstarwchr/) and a New Jersey advocacy program (//www.monmouth.com/~ksears/litepol1.htm).

3. View a picture taken by the Hubble Space Telescope of the farthest reaches of space (//hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/01/text). Write a letter to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration stating your feelings about such powerful cameras. Do you value the images of other celestial bodies revealed through this amazing photography, or do you feel that investing in such powerful photography capabilities is an inefficient use of government funds?

4. In the foreseeable future, light pollution may make it very difficult to see stars at any time. Create a “star capsule” that compiles images and descriptions of stars that will inform young children in the future about what they are missing.

5. Perform a light pollution experiment. Take a night walk to a very illuminated location and count the number of stars you can see, and then repeat your count at a very dark location nearby. Create a graph of your data, and write a conclusion about to what you think the term “light pollution” refers.

6. Explore the “Moon Hoax” controversy by researching different claims made to support or refute the belief that astronauts landed on the moon. Compare the scientific experimentation and explanations offered by Ian Goddard (//iangoddard.net/moon01.htm) with those offered by Kevin Overstreet (//batesmotel.8m.com/). Write a persuasive essay supporting or refuting the hoax theory, using scientific explanations in your writing.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Mathematics – Analyze a picture of visible light on Earth from space (//earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/Images/land_ocean_ice_lights_2048.jpg). Estimate what percent of the landmasses are most inundated by light pollution. Explain your estimation technique in words. Then, place a piece of graph paper over the picture and confirm your estimation, using a ratio of the number of boxes where light is visible over the total number of boxes covering the landmasses. Analyze the areas that show the highest concentration of light use. What do these patterns reveal about the world?

Global Studies – Locate a city on another landmass that has the opposite light situation as your own city. Write a letter to a young person in that city describing what your city’s sky looks like. Ask him or her to explain what the sky in his or her foreign city looks like.

Technology – Create an illustrated timeline that charts the technological advances in cameras. How do digital cameras of today compare with or differ from the self-standing vintage cameras of the late 1800’s?
