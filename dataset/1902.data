Roland Lewis, the president and chief executive of the Waterfront Alliance, answered City Room readers’ questions this week about land use, environmental concerns and preservation of New York and New Jersey’s waterways and harbors. Following is his third and final set of responses. We are no longer accepting questions on this feature.

Why is there no official waterfront access for the entire southern coast of the South Bronx? It is the longest stretch of land with no riverfront access. What is M.W.A. doing about it and who else is working on this important issue of equity?

You are correct that the southern coast of the Bronx is sorely lacking in waterfront access. A start was made with Barreto Street Park and the Hunts Point Riverside Park, but there are literally miles of shorefront that could have access points. In terms of waterfront access the new park at Yankee Stadium also leaves much to be desired. There are great organizations in the Bronx that are working to fix this, including Sustainable South Bronx, the Point and the Bronx River Alliance. The Waterfront Alliance is working with Borough President Carrion’s office and the New York State Department of State to identify and promote waterfront access points in the South Bronx.

I am concerned about the loss of the Todd Shipyard graving dock that was filled for Ikea’s parking lot in Red Hook. Especially when the city just came out with a report saying we need more graving docks in order for our maritime industry to stay competitive. Why do we need ship repair facilities? What’s special about the Erie Basin and Brooklyn waterfront in Red Hook?

The loss of the Todd Shipyard to an Ikea parking lot was a tough blow to the maritime industry in New York. In hindsight, that decision was particularly disappointing as New York’s Economic Development Corporation’s Maritime Location Study conducted by SUNY Maritime recently concluded that New York City needs eight more ship repair facilities to handle the backlog for this growing industry. Red Hook, with its deep water, is ideally suited for the maritime industry and across the Erie Basin from Ikea the Erie Basin bargeport hums with activity with tugs and barges coming and going.

The Red Hook story is still unfolding. On either side of the Swedish furniture store are now vacant lots, one of them was once home to the Revere sugar factory. Will the city follow the prescription in its own report and use this critically needed space for maritime activity, or are we sliding down the commercial retail slippery slope with Home Depot, Bed Bath and Beyond and their ilk taking up this waterfront space? Ikea itself could help the maritime cause. The store controls two piers that could be used by companies like Hughes Marine to relieve its overcrowded operation in Erie Basin. Also, Ikea, while it was in development, said that it would consider shipping in its goods by barge. What a green and progressive waterfront stroke that would be.

And finally, the Todd Shipyard is buried but not gone. This valuable piece of maritime infrastructure (worth hundreds of millions of dollars if built today) could someday be excavated and put back to work. The Red Hook story is far from over. Stay tuned and get involved.

I understand that boat and ship motors are not very efficient and are not regulated in any degree as cars are. Do you think increased ferries and other commercial motorboats, small and large, will increase air and noise pollution on the water? Can New York City enforce its own regulations for boat motor emissions?

Getting people on ferries, and goods and recyclables on barges, will get cars and trucks off of our roads, which would help to clean our air. But if we do not work to clean up the engines that power these vessels, we are replacing one problem with another. M.W.A. urges the use of use clean fuels on the water. The City of New York has gotten the ball rolling by mandating the use of lower sulfur diesel fuel on the Staten Island Ferry beginning in 2008. Legislation has also been introduced in the New York City Council that would mandate cleaner fuels for all ferries. Finally, bulk purchase of low sulfur diesel or biofuel would help lower the cost for smaller operators.

Any idea what’s planned for re-use of the West 135th Street marine transfer station — which is not slated for use under the city’s solid waste management plan? Is there a planning process under way?

The use for the West 135th Street Marine Transfer Station is still not determined. WEACT, the Harlem based environmental justice organization, is working closely with the City and other community leaders is organizing a community-based charrette process that would work to find the best possible reuse for the transfer station.

I was wondering what is in store for those rusty ancient piers along the Hudson around 63rd Street (and maybe a brief history of what they originally were used for). I know that Donald Trump apparently ripped one down, and it seemed as if he got his hands on half of the others before someone was able to stop him. Are those remaining structures going to be protected, or does it seem he will eventually be able to get rid of them to complete his little Battery Park North? At this point, they are really natural sculptures and a great reminder that not all of this city’s past can be bought and turned into a suburb. Is there hope?

I’m with Zac — I also worry about any possible plans for removal of the old piers in river near the West 60s. Please tell me they’re going to stay!

Those old rusty structures are now commonly known as the “Spaghetti Pier.” Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe and many other appreciators of fine, accidental art lobbied to keep them, and they have been saved at least for the time being as a science experiment as the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation and the city’s Parks Department are using them to determine the effect of shading on Hudson River fish. I hope the study is very thorough and the Spaghetti Piers stay up for a good long time.

I know there was a huge fire in Greenpoint that destroyed most of the neighborhood. But I hope that a commemorative park and small museum is established on the East River’s edge to preserve the Monitor’s special piece of history! The site also, as I remember, had a wonderful view of the New York City’s wonderful skyline.

If my Dad was alive, he would have been very sad to see that the World Trade Center towers were destroyed. He had worked on the very precarious top of those buildings installing water lines and air-conditioning equipment. It had been very dangerous work — he was so proud of his effort! We could actually see the towers from the top floor of our Oak Street home. Well, at least my family has its unforgettable memories. Let’s hope the Monitor historic site will be restored to the East River water’s edge. I’m sure there are many others who lived in the area that would like to see it preserved, too.

Thank you for your reminiscence about Greenpoint. The group you should look up and get involved with is the Greenpoint Monitor Museum. The museum does not yet have a home, but does not lack for enthusiasts, and it would probably welcome a native daughter to lend a hand. When this museum is created it will be a welcome addition to the North Brooklyn waterfront as a well as valuable educational resource about our nation’s history.

How will the Governors Island’s waterfront be handled? The simpler, least commercial, the better.

Many people call Governors Island “the Central Park of the Waterfront.” Its future has yet to be decided. Great progress has been made in providing access and fun programming on the island — and most recently in establishing a world-class park. A design team was selected for a 40-acre park on the southern half of the island on the island, and design work and some demolition is now under way. The island also contains two historic forts run by the National Park Service. The open question is what will be the programming and use for the dozens of historic buildings on the northern two-thirds of the island. You can keep up to date about news and events on the island by visiting the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation and the Governors Island Alliance. But most of all, if you have not made the trip, please do. Especially now, before the commercial use of the island is settled on — it is a remarkable oasis in the middle of our harbor.

My question is: given the recession New York State is facing, what impact will the budget cuts both at a city and state level will have on the development and preservation of the waterfront? How can citizens situated at various levels and with a wide range of professional training do pro bono work and assist in the wonderful work already in progress? How can we partner up to make this happen?

We are entering tough economic times and many of the waterfront efforts will be delayed or possibly even threatened. Your instinct to lend a hand would be welcome by many of the Waterfront Alliance partners. Visit our list of partners at our site and shop around for a waterfront organization that interests you and go volunteer. The economic cycles will come and go, but the mission driven work to transform our waterfront by the many alliance partners will persevere and your support will be welcome.

Are there plans and a time line to connect the Upper East Side greenway with the Harlem River Esplanade? It is one of the major missing pieces in making the Manhattan Greenway possible. Currently, bridge repair has taken acres of waterfront land from 125th Street to 135th Street — a 10-block detour. Then, after the Harlem River Esplanade ends at 142nd Street, a bicyclist or pedestrian must detour for another 10-13 blocks until the greenway begins again at 156th Street.

Unfortunately, because of its isolation, the Harlem River Esplanade is an area full of gangs, drug use and homeless people. By connecting it north and south, it will be used and patrolled more and would greatly improve the area.

There are plans, but unfortunately they have been put on hold for as long as eight years, as the Department of Transportation has taken over this stretch of the waterfront as a staging area for the rebuilding of the Harlem River Drive. One bright spot is the stretch between 139th Street and 142nd Street — where the M.W.A. is in partnership with community partners like as the Harlem River Park Task Force and the city’s Departments of Parks and Recreation — have redesigned the edge of this waterfront. The concrete bulkhead is being replaced with a variegated shoreline that will include a sitting are that could serve as an outdoor classroom, tidal pools and a pilot project oyster bed. It will be environmental and accessible. It opens this fall. Check it out.

More than the number of questions from so many City Room readers this week, the passion and intelligence of your queries and comments impressed me. It is our waterfront. Please be sure politicians, government officials and policymakers remember that, and keep thinking, writing and working to create the world-class waterfront we all deserve.
