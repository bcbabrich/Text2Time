Slide 1 of 12,

Start the morning in the heart of Lima with a stroll up Jirón de la Unión, the pedestrian zone that leads to the Plaza Mayor, Lima's main square. Pass modish shops and colorful 200-year-old colonial facades and emerge into a wide square surrounded by some of Lima's finest architecture. Here, a bronze fountain built in 1650 graces the center of the Plaza.
