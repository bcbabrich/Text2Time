Marines withdrew Friday from most of the positions they had taken during the three-week siege of this city, as the American military began handing over control of security here to an Iraqi general under Saddam Hussein and up to 1,100 men under his command.

Marines abandoned buildings and bulldozed earthworks in southern and western neighborhoods of the city as the former major general, Jasim Muhammad Saleh, rolled into town wearing his old uniform with its crossed swords and eagle on the epaulets. Hundreds of residents cheered him along the streets, some waving the old Iraqi flag.

In a country where tribal loyalties are by far the most powerful allegiance, it is unclear whether support of the occupation forces or national interests can supersede those or whether the Iraqi force will be willing or able to fight the insurgents.

Gen. John P. Abizaid, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, cautioned in a teleconference from Qatar that the entry of the Iraqi soldiers would not necessarily quell the insurgency anytime soon. ''I think that we should be very careful in thinking that this effort to build this Iraqi capacity will necessarily calm down the situation in Falluja tonight or over the next several days,'' he said. ''It's a step-by-step effort that will have to include a clear understanding of the security situation.''[Page A6.]
