''Look at the excitement the Knicks created when they won the lottery three years ago and came away with Patrick Ewing,'' said Bianchi, who was then an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns. ''Then look at the players Patrick was surrounded with. That team won 23 games, and over the last three seasons, they were 71-175. That record alone was enough to make us want to change the chemistry of the team.''

Changes were made. Jawaan Oldham, Rory Sparrow and Gerald Henderson, the players over the age of 30, followed 31-year-old King elsewhere. If the right deals were to come along, Bianchi would also move Bill Cartwright and Pat Cummings, two others who are over 30.

''When I got here,'' Bianchi said, ''we were woefully weak in rebounding and lacked a point guard. The addition of Sidney Green has moved us from the league's worst rebounding team to eighth best. I was not here when we drafted Jackson, but he has certainly taken care of the playmaking problems. The two most important positions in basketball are the center and playmaker, and we now have them both in place to build around.'' Still More Problems

The Knicks may also have come up with another find in Johnny Newman, a much-needed shooter who was cut loose by the Cleveland Cavaliers.

But there is still much wrong with the Knicks that needs to be corrected before they can be considered a contender, even at the divisional level. Many of the problems begin with Ewing's inability to stay out of early foul trouble. The 7-foot center is averaging 29 minutes of playing time and is averaging 19.7 points a game. There is also a need for more consistency from Gerald Wilkins, more scoring from the forward positions, better outside shooting and fewer turnovers and fouls. The Knicks lead the league in both committing and forcing turnovers.

Pitino and Bianchi are not without fault. Pitino, a hard worker and great motivator, may someday be a premier pro coach, but for now he needs to have a better feel for substitutions and matchups, and must learn that practice is for teaching and games are for coaching.

Bianchi could have done better than to allow the Knicks to wind up with Billy Donovan, the top player on Pitino's Providence College team last year, as Jackson's backup at point guard. Donovan is averaging under 3 points a game.
