NEITHER Hugh Wolff, the music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, nor Michael Torke, the composer whose new piece opens the ensemble's New Jersey concerts next week, would bruit it about that they are on the brink of wider horizons. But these private hopes have already taken form in the minds of admirers, who are happy to blow their cover.

Mr. Wolff, a former leader of the New Jersey Symphony, is visiting next week on a tour with the St. Paul group. Next year is to be his last with that ensemble, and ostensibly he leaves without a future position. He'll just float around the scene as Kurt Masur's contract with the New York Philharmonic expires; as the Philadelphia Orchestra rolls over Wolfgang Sawallisch's contract; as Seiji Ozawa battles for artistic control of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where he has been dug in for what some say is too long.

Mr. Wolff, 45, is a gifted, cosmopolitan American in a time when the music world is asking why more American orchestras don't have American leaders. Paris born and Harvard trained (like Yo-Yo Ma), he studied composition with Messiaen, and has guest-conducted every one of this country's first-rank orchestras.

Next week's concerts in Morristown and Princeton show off Mr. Wolff as a classicist and an American adventurer. Beethoven's Symphony No. 8 and Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor, both from the heart of the repertory, are preceded by Michael Torke's ''Lucent Variations,'' a 15-minute commissioned work introduced in St. Paul only a few weeks ago.
