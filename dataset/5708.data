Two gunmen forced a supermarket manager to a back office Saturday night and shot him fatally in the head while his wife was kept outside the office.

The victim, 39-year-old Mario Burgio of Lindenhurst, was dead at the Foodtown store on Austin Boulevard and Long Beach Road.

The police reported that Mr. Burgio's wife, Patricia, had just arrived at the store at about 10 P.M. when the gunmen, both described as in their early 20's, confronted them in a holdup attempt. After Mr. Burgio was taken to the office, his wife heard a shot ring out, the police said.

Mrs. Burgio was not hurt.

The two men tried first to escape through the rear of the store but, unable to do so, broke a front window and fled, according to the police.
