''The Sorbonne should be razed, and Chris Marker put up in its place,'' the poet Henri Michaux is reported to have said, a remark that seems almost reasonable in light of ''A Grin Without a Cat,'' a fascinating 1977 documentary by Mr. Marker that opens today, in a restored and updated version, at the Film Forum in the South Village.

Born Christian-François Bouche-Villeneuve in an upper-class suburb of Paris, Mr. Marker, who will turn 82 this year, has been credited with inventing the ''essay film,'' a form pitched between documentary and personal reflection. The documentary side of his work is reflected in his interest in history, and specifically in the history of revolutionary movements: ''A Grin Without a Cat'' tells the story of the New Left, from the movement's birth as a byproduct of the Vietnam War to the ouster of Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973.

The personal, philosophical side of Mr. Marker's work is reflected in his exploration of memory, a subject he treated as science fiction in the 1962 film that remains his most famous creation, ''La Jetée'' (remade by Terry Gilliam as ''12 Monkeys'' in 1995). For Mr. Marker, truth is always a matter of an individual's point of view: history does not exist apart from our experience and interpretation of it.

Divided into two 90-minute parts, ''A Grin Without a Cat'' (the French title is an untranslatable slogan from May 1968, ''Le Fond de l'Air Est Rouge'') combines anonymous newsreels going back to the Russian Revolution with original material filmed by Mr. Marker in Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Washington and elsewhere. Part 1, subtitled ''Fragile Hands,'' traces the growth of the student antiwar movement into the revolutionary surge that nearly toppled the government of Charles de Gaulle in 1968; Part 2, ''Severed Hands,'' moves from the Russian repression of the Prague Spring to the coup d'état in Chile.
