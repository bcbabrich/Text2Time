JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Even with one more win, Bobby Bowden couldn’t gain ground on Penn State’s Joe Paterno, the coach with the most career victories in the Football Bowl Subdivision. At the same time Florida State was beating West Virginia, 33-21, in Bowden’s swan song at the Gator Bowl, Paterno’s Nittany Lions were holding off L.S.U., 19-17, at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando.

Paterno, 82, has 394 victories. Bowden, 80, ended his 55-year coaching career with 389 but stands to lose as many as 14 of those because of academic misconduct.

“I wanted 400 so bad,” Bowden said, “because I felt like, well, Joe is going to beat me. When they took away those games, Joe is going to beat me. And if I could just get to 400, it would be me and him. I could hang around with him and follow him around a little bit.”

Bowden, who has coached the past 34 seasons at Florida State, was forced to resign at the end of the Seminoles’ 6-6 regular season. He will be replaced by the offensive coordinator, Jimbo Fisher. Bowden wished to coach one more year so he could reach the 400-win milestone. Despite not being able to go out on his own terms, Bowden said he is at peace.

“I’m not ate up with coaching football at my life,” he said. “I have got 80 years in. I wanted 81, but I got 80 years in. I wanted more and couldn’t have it. They wouldn’t let me have it.”

He added: “I have always felt like, you can’t take it with you. If I want more games than anybody else, which I’m not, Joe is, so what? When I die, I can’t take it with me. There are things in life more important. There are just things more important than that to me. That’s why I’m at peace with myself.”

He said he was reminded after the game that victories aren’t everything. In the locker room, Bowden’s players asked him to sign their jerseys and he was able to spend a few minutes with former players like Derrick Brooks and Chris Weinke, one of two Heisman Trophy winners that Bowden coached.

“It is a great closeness there,” Bowden said. “It’s is like a family. And I really appreciate all those boys coming back to the game.”
