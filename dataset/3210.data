To the Editor:

Many Americans are complaining that the military tribunals for terrorists would be unfair (''President Defends Military Tribunals in Terrorist Cases,'' front page, Nov. 30). It's time for these people to wake up.

This is not some storybook we live in. These terrorists do not care at all for our civil liberties or our lives, and they would probably just as soon kill any American trying to stand up for their rights. The idea that we should be fair to them is utopian at best and foolish at worst.

These people view themselves as soldiers at war, so let's treat them as such. It would be a terrible shame if a terrorist were on trial in a civilian court and got off on some technicality. It is better to put these people away for good. I couldn't care less about their ''rights.'' Remember, they don't care about ours.
