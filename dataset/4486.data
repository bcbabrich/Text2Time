IN the Yankee manager's office, someone said, "Did you hear the Orioles got Fred McGriff?" Buck Showalter's head spun, prompting an apologetic "just kidding." Showalter didn't even smile.

"McGriff wouldn't make the difference for the Orioles," the Yankee manager was saying now in his serious manner, referring to the San Diego Padres' first baseman who led the National League in homers last season. "They'd have to give up David Segui, who could be the best first baseman in the league some day. Pitching is what people have to add."

Pitching is what the Toronto Blue Jays, the eventual World Series champions, added late last season in acquiring David Cone from the Mets.

Pitching is what the Blue Jays will be searching for soon, as will the Yankees, the Tigers and the Orioles. The Yankees are whispered to be seeking Tim Belcher of the Cincinnati Reds or Dennis Martinez of the Montreal Expos, but they might have to settle for Mark Hutton, the Australian right-hander at their Columbus farm team.
