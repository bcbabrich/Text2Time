Bulldozer’s Big Day

By Candace Fleming. Illustrated by Eric Rohman.

These days, toddlers — or maybe it’s parents — like their truck books gruff on the outside and touchy-feely at the center, and this one complies nicely. Bulldozer, a perky yellow chap with a thick black outline, “couldn’t wait to invite all his friends to his party.” So he cruises around the construction site, “blade held high,” trying to get his vehicle friends interested by asking them to “guess what today is!” One by one, they grumble that it’s just a day for work. Devastated, Bulldozer drags his blade away, until the construction whistle blows and a giant sheet-metal birthday cake emerges from a pit. It was all a friendly trick, capped off by slices of cake. Rohmann, who won a Caldecott Medal for “My Friend Rabbit” and a Caldecott Honor for “Time Flies,” wisely does not show the partygoers actually eating the steely cake, but surely vehicle-loving children will have no problem imagining how that goes down.
