The first question for Carlos Zambrano on Wednesday was about his last two starts. Zambrano, the Cubs’ hulking right-hander, would have nothing of it.

“What games?” he replied. When reminded, Zambrano dismissed the idea that his last two starts — when he struggled following his no-hitter — were relevant.

“It’s in the past,” he said. “This is a new age, a new stage for the Cubs. New ballgame, new team. And I just have to go out there and try to do my job and have fun.”

If Zambrano does his job the way he usually does it, the Cubs will tie their division series with the Dodgers, who battered the Cubs, 7-2, in Game 1. If he does not, it will officially be time to panic on the North Side.

The Cubs have lost their last seven postseason games — Games 5, 6 and 7 of the infamous 2003 N.L.C.S., all three in last year’s division series with Arizona, and the first game Wednesday against the Dodgers. Plus, there’s that whole century-without-a-championship thing.

“We are responsible to break this 100 years that we don’t win,” Zambrano acknowledged. “But if we think about that and we keep that in our mind, it would be too much pressure for us. We don’t think about that. We just think that we have a good team and we can win it all.”

The Cubs certainly can, though they’ll need an improvement from Zambrano, who has given up 13 runs in his last six and a third innings, with seven walks and three strikeouts. Eventually, Zambrano did offer a quick analysis of what needs to change in Game 2.

“First pitch strikes and challenge the hitters,” he said. “If my sinker is working, everything will be different.”
