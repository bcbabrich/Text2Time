Conrail yesterday designated Richard D. Sanborn Jr., a railroad executive from outside the company, as the next person to run the large Northeast freight line.

Mr. Sanborn was named president and chief operating officer effective next Monday. The board of Conrail, or more formally the Consolidated Rail Corporation, said it intended to elect Mr. Sanborn later this year to succeed L. Stanley Crane, 72 years old, as chairman and chief executive effective next Jan. 1, after Mr. Crane retires.

Mr. Sanborn, 51, is a 1960 graduate of the Harvard Law School with 27 years of experience in the railroad industry. As president, he succeeds Stuart M. Reed, 62, who resigned at the end of last year after being passed over as a possible successor to Mr. Crane.

Mr. Crane had wanted Mr. Reed to leave, individuals familiar with the situation said at that time, so that the person chosen as Mr. Crane's successor could prepare for the top position by first serving as president and chief operating officer.
