Although my recipe makes enough for 12, I wouldn't halve it. Simply freeze the six you don't want as soon as they cool, and make life easier for yourself another day. Shortcakes really have to be eaten the day they are made (if you are not freezing them), so unless you have a voracious horde coming over, it isn't worth splitting and filling the whole batch now. Besides, once you make these, you're going to have requests for them again. Now you're prepared. So sit back and enjoy the remaining bit of summer while you can.

SALMON WITH THYME, LEMON BUTTER AND ALMONDS Time: 40 minutes

1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 4-pound salmon, cleaned and scaled, head and tail removed 2 scallions, trimmed 1 small bunch (about 1/2 cup) fresh thyme 6 tablespoons melted butter 1 tablespoon sea salt 1/3 cup sliced almonds Juice of half a lemon.

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Lay out a double layer of foil big enough to wrap fish in, and drizzle with oil. Place fish on foil. Put scallions and half the thyme in cavity of fish. Drizzle 2 tablespoons butter over fish, and sprinkle with salt to taste. Wrap fish loosely, place on a baking sheet and bake 35 minutes. 2. Place a small skillet over medium heat. When pan is hot, add almonds, and stir until golden brown. Remove from pan, and set aside. In a small bowl, combine remaining melted butter and lemon juice; set aside. 3. When fish is cooked, carefully peel skin from side facing you. With a knife, divide fish in three portions by making two long cuts parallel to each other and perpendicular to the backbone. Cut down to the rib bones, but do not cut through them. Remove a portion of meat by sliding a spatula over rib bones and pulling meat away; repeat with 2 remaining portions, and place on three warmed plates. Remove backbone and attached rib bones. Cut three more fillets from remaining fish, placing them on plates. 4. Drizzle lemon butter over each fillet, and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Pull leaves from remaining sprigs of thyme, and scatter over fillets. Serve immediately.

Yield: 6 servings.

CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY SHORTCAKES Time: 40 minutes

For the shortcakes:

Vegetable oil or nonstick spray, for pan 1 2/3 cups flour 1/3 cup cocoa 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 2 tablespoons sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) diced chilled butter 1 large egg 1 cup sour cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 tablespoons honey

For the filling: 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar 1 cup raspberries.

1. To prepare shortcakes, heat oven to 400 degrees. Oil bottom of each cup in a 12-cup muffin pan. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and sugar. Using a pastry blender or an electric mixer, or working by hand, cut in the butter until mixture resembles damp sand. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg, sour cream, vanilla and honey. Add to flour mixture, and stir until thoroughly blended. 2. Put a scant 1/4 cup dough into each muffin cup. (Do not use muffin papers.) Bake until risen and firm on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. Then remove from pan, and cool completely. Place 6 shortcakes in an airtight freezer bag, and freeze for another use. 3. To prepare filling for 6 shortcakes, whip heavy cream with 2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar until thick but still soft. Add 1/2 cup raspberries to cream, mashing them roughly with a fork. 4. Split each shortcake in half horizontally, and place a dollop of raspberry cream onto bottom half. Add a portion of whole raspberries, and put the top back on at an angle. Sprinkle a dusting of the remaining 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar over shortcakes, and serve.

Yield: 12 shortcakes, and filling for 6.
