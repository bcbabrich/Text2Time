City officials reminded the construction and real estate industries on Tuesday that the city’s new Construction Codes — the first modernization of the Building Code since 1968 — formally took effect today. The codes, based on international models, expand requirements for fire protection, structural integrity and work-site accountability and are intended to focus the Buildings Department’s enforcement work on the buildings and job sites that “pose the most serious safety hazards to construction workers and the public,” the Bloomberg administration said in a statement.

The construction codes were signed into law last July and most recently updated in March of this year. The implementation of the new codes comes as the Buildings Department has faced intense scrutiny over recent construction accidents — including two fatal crane collapses — and accusations of corruption among its ranks of inspectors.

Under city law, today marked the start of a one-year transition period during which applications for new buildings may comply with either the 1968 code or the new codes, which include standards for buildings, fuel and gas, mechanical systems, and plumbing. As of July 1, 2009, the new codes will be required for all new construction.

The new codes include a new system for classifying building violations; new safety procedures for buildings under construction; the use of third-party inspectors to monitor work sites for compliance as construction proceeds; stronger design requirements for steel and concrete construction; new requirements for emergency voice communication systems and emergency power generators in all new residential buildings 125 feet or higher; and an expansion in the requirement of automated sprinkler systems. Such sprinklers will now be required in residential buildings of three units or more, attached two-family homes, and one- and two-family homes that are more than three stories.
