WASHINGTON, April 30 —The Pentagon said today that “at no time during the Alaskan quake was there a loss of warning capability of any operational significance.”

A statement said that the “site at Clear, Alaska, lost power for six minutes due to a malfunction, but coverage came from other parts of the system.”
