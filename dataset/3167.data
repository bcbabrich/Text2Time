To the Editor:

Despite the crushing defeat suffered by rebel forces at the Battle of Long Island (news article, Aug. 25), New York City was nonetheless home to many important victories on the road to independence and freedom.

Historians have long attributed the principle of freedom of the press in America to the victorious trial of John Peter Zenger, owner of The New York Weekly Journal, in 1735 for ''seditious libels'' against the state.

In 1770, two months before the Boston Massacre, American blood was spilled on John Street in the Battle of Golden Hill, when citizens and the Sons of Liberty battled British troops.

And until World War I, New Yorkers celebrated Evacuation Day every year to commemorate the British departure from the city at the end of the Revolution.
