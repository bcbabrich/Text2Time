W.H. Auden is one of those poets who has a poem for every mood, and for a surprising number of occasions, too. For those about to undertake a lecture tour, the poem to turn to is “On the Circuit,” which he wrote after undertaking a tour at the behest of his lecture agency, Columbia-Giesen-Management. Auden describes sitting in his plane, being whisked off to various destinations in fulfilment of his agency’s “unfathomable will.” This tour, he tells us, exposes him to various excruciating experiences, including “girl organists in bars” (these must surely have largely disappeared) and reading Conrad Hilton’s “Be My Guest” (this has not disappeared). What makes it bearable for Auden, though, is coming across the odd delightful face or a chance meeting with a Tolkien addict. And at the end of the day, as he implies in the poem’s final line, he is being paid to do it.

I have just returned from a lecture tour of the United States and Auden’s poem comes naturally to mind. Columbia-Giesen-Management seems to be no longer, but the unfathomable will I was obeying was that of a fine organization called the Stephen Barclay Agency, of Petaluma, California. Actually, its will makes perfect sense and is expressed in beautifully-detailed documents setting out every step of my criss-crossing of the United States. You will start, I am told, in Austin, from where you will go to Waco. There then follows a long list of cities, from Syracuse to Santa Barbara.

As the tour progresses, the days begin to blur. And blur affects the hotels too, which start to fade into one another, although sometimes a truly exceptional carpet pattern leaps out or a bellman says something memorable. So many hotels these days are quite undistinguishable from one another and have been designed, it would seem, to obliterate any sense of the local and any element of soul; one ends up, then, remembering the good places and forgetting the rest. Slight eccentricities, or idiosyncrasies perhaps, are what makes a hotel memorable. If you are in Portland, Oregon, you must stay in The Heathman, and take a look at their doorman in his curious Beefeater costume and hat covered with flowers. And if you go into their bar, wear your kilt (as I did) and you will find that your drinks are bought for you. It is a most hospitable place.

But then, but then … some hotels are less accommodating. In upstate New York I stayed in a hotel where there was a traumatic tomato incident. I was, I hasten to point out, the innocent party, and it all began when I decided to have a simple breakfast. Now I know that as a Scotsman I pronounce certain things the wrong way (from an American perspective) even if it is the right way in the streets of Edinburgh. So I asked for scrambled eggs – pronounced the same way on both sides on the Atlantic – and a sliced, uncooked tomato. I was careful to say “tomayto” (American and right) rather than “tomarto” (British and utterly laughable and unintelligible). When the waitress, therefore, looked at me sternly and said that I could not have the tomato, it had nothing to do with my having committed the offense of being British in a built-up area.

I reeled under the rebuff. I did not think that it was an unreasonable request, given that the kitchen shelves were probably groaning under the weight of tomatoes. But no, she said that I could not have a tomato because the combination of scrambled eggs and tomato did not exist. In a state of shock, I settled for scrambled eggs and toast, but five minutes later she returned and said to me, quite straight-faced, “You can have the tomato after all.” I thanked her and she acknowledged the thanks.

I am all in favor of rules, but there are some circumstances in which they become tyrannical. There must be a rule against substitution in menus. Presumably, after the manager was consulted, the use of a tomato was approved. It was such a tiny thing, but these matters can sometimes be representative of far greater issues.

Tomatoes were liberally available in Austin, at the gala dinner kicking off the Texas Book Festival. That was a splendid affair, at which I had been invited to speak, along with the historian David McCullough, among others. At drinks beforehand, Mr. McCullough told a story of the sort one hears rather often today – that he appeared to be on some list which made him the subject of particularly stringent security checks at airports. He had no idea how he ended up on that list, where the list was, or how to get off it. This makes one think of both Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Mikado” (“I’ve got a little list! I’ve got a little list!”) and the novels of Franz Kafka (what list?). McCullough revealed that on some occasions he appears to be lower down the list than usual and is given only a perfunctory extra going-over. I suggested that this was, in a curious way, a bit insulting, and that he should ask for an upgrade in his classification.

There were other people there – almost a thousand, in fact. One who stood out was the remarkable Kinky Freidman, with whom I had a very brief conversation. I did not exactly get what he said (he pronounces tomato in a strange way), perhaps because he was talking with a large, unlit cigar in his mouth. He stood out, of course, by virtue of the fact that he was dressed entirely in black and wore a large Texan hat, also black. This was inside, of course, where nobody else was wearing a hat, even if it is customary, I believe, for echt Texans to eat their meals with their hats on. I imagine that Kinky Friedman’s Stetson might have made it difficult for the waitresses, who would have had to reach round the very considerable brim to serve his dinner. It might have been easier for them to place the food in the brim of the hat, thereby enabling Mr. Friedman to reach up and take items out when required.

In case you don’t know, Kinky Friedman, an irreverent musician-turned-writer, is standing for the post of governor of Texas. Like all the other authors at the festival, I was invited to breakfast in the governor’s mansion, where we were greeted by the governor himself, who wore no hat. I did not see Mr. Friedman at this breakfast. It may be that he thought it would be embarrassing for his host if he saw one of the guests measuring up the furniture and mentally planning how to re-arrange it. If Mr. Friedman were to find himself in the governor’s mansion – on a long-term basis, that is – the parties would be lively. Probably not breakfast, though, which I suspect is not his style.

But if I entertained any thoughts that the voters of Texas might elect Mr. Friedman, these were dispelled when I continued on to Waco.
