TENNIS Top 3 Lose in Paris Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker and Jim Courier -- the three highest-seeded players in the Paris Open -- were eliminated yesterday in the third round, but Courier moved up to No. 2 in the world ranking despite his loss. Boris Becker, seeded second, withdrew from the tournament because of the flu. He will be No. 3 when the next computer ranking of the Association of Tennis Professionals is released. Michael Chang was a 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 winner over Edberg, who is the defending champion and who is ranked No. 1. Omar Camporese beat the third-seeded Courier, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. In the best match of the day, Pete Sampras outgunned Goran Ivanisevic, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), in a battle of booming services. Ivanisevic had 26 aces, but none in the deciding tie breaker.
