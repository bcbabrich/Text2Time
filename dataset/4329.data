The police report on the gathering of that evidence was written by Philip L. Vannater and Tom Lange, two of the four detectives who went to Mr. Simpson's home early on the morning after the killings. The report lists 24 "red stains," including what the detectives describe as blood on the door handle on the driver's side of the Bronco, blood droplets leading from the van to the front door of the house and blood on a brown leather glove, similar to a glove that investigators say they recovered near the body of Mr. Goldman outside Mrs. Simpson's home.

An Early but Critical Juncture

The defense motion to suppress the evidence could be crucial to the case against Mr. Simpson.

Because there are apparently no eyewitnesses to the murders, and because the murder weapon has never been found, prosecutors are expected to rely heavily on bloodstains, blood and tissue samples and other evidence seized from Mr. Simpson's home and obtained at the crime scene.

So if defense lawyers can convince a judge that the evidence was gathered in violation of Mr. Simpson's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure, the prosecution's case could be weakened significantly.

'Control of the Premises'

The defense motion, filed late Wednesday, deals with evidence gathered by the detectives when they went to Mr. Simpson's house at 5 A.M. on June 13 to tell him of the murders. He was not there, however, having left on the flight to Chicago several hours earlier.

When the detectives got no answer by ringing a doorbell at the front gate and telephoning the house, the motion says, one of them climbed over the wall surrounding the house and let three others in. After that, the document says, the detectives walked around the grounds and "assumed control of the premises."

The defense motion contends that the authorities had no right to enter the property after determining that Mr. Simpson was not home. "Once they have determined no one is home by knocking or ringing a bell," the motion says, "their official business is ended."
