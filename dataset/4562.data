The divided people of Korea have good reason to celebrate the old year along with the new. The withdrawal of all U.S. nuclear arms from South Korea made the peninsula nuclear-free. Now a potentially far-reaching agreement between the Governments of the South and the North could keep it that way.

Yesterday's accord reaffirms the commitment of the two Governments, undertaken in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, not to acquire nuclear arms. And it goes two critical steps further: It commits North Korea not to construct facilities for reprocessing nuclear material, and it opens the way to on-site inspection by the South of a suspect facility in the North.

The agreement thus provides a script for defusing nuclear fears on the peninsula. One: Washington assures Pyongyang that it has indeed withdrawn all nuclear arms from the peninsula and resumes pulling out troops. Two: Pyongyang signs the safeguards accord that allows access by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Three: Seoul calls off Team Spirit, the joint military exercises it conducts annually with the U.S.

And then, most important of all, Pyongyang faithfully implements the key provisions of yesterday's accord by accepting inspection of its suspected reprocessing plant at Yongbyon -- and, if necessary, by halting construction. These steps will speed the reconciliation of North and South, help create ties between the U.S. and North Korea and assure a peaceful new year for all Koreans.
