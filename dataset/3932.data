"A form of complacency we seem to be looking at here is a crew's loss of the big picture, sometimes called situation awareness," said C. O. Miller, an internationally respected safety consultant. "Loss of awareness is too often compounded by excessive dependence on these automated systems, especially when there is only a short time to act."

Here is how the airliner would normally have been operated on its trip and what initial analysis of flight-recorder data indicates led to the disaster:

Before takeoff from Miami, the flight management computer was programmed to guide the plane on a standard route, taking it past a succession of radio-navigation stations, or fixes, on the ground. The computer system would automatically tune in successive stations. The plane's automatic pilot would steer the plane either directly over stations, or off to one side at specified distances, or over the intersection of signals from two stations.

The pilots' role was to use radios and dashboard instruments to verify that the automatic system was taking them where it was supposed to. They also would radio controllers, keeping them updated on the plane's location.

The primary ground stations are known as V.O.R.'s, for "very high frequency omnidirectional range station." These send out radio signals so a crew will know the precise direction from their plane to the station. More advanced stations also have distance-measuring equipment that shows on a cockpit instrument the miles from plane to station.

The flight, on a clear but moonless night, seemed problem-free until the southbound plane neared the V.O.R. station named Tulua.

Controllers at Cali had cleared the pilots to fly to the Cali V.O.R., just south of the airport, where radar destroyed by guerrillas had never been replaced. The pilots were to report passing Tulua and to keep to an altitude of 15,000 feet. That was vital because the assigned route went down a valley between treacherous Andes peaks.

The pilots never did report reaching Tulua, and the station appears to be a fateful link in the events that led to the crash. Two minutes after the pilots acknowledged that they would report at Tulua, controllers radioed that the wind at Cali was calm and asked the crew if they could land from the north.
