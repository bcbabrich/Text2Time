Reflecting a growing awareness that China's heavy reliance on paid blood donors is contributing to the rapid spread of AIDS, a new law banning the buying and selling of blood takes effect on Thursday.

Medical centers all over China are bracing for disruptions. To meet rising medical needs, China's hospitals use a system in which poor people sell their blood, sometimes to middlemen who falsely declare that their products have been screened for disease.

Paying for blood, rather than relying on voluntary donations, has been virtually banned in most countries because it promotes the spread of AIDS, hepatitis and other infections. People who sell their blood tend to be at high risk of such diseases and, as has happened here, unhygienic centers trading in blood for profit may themselves spread infections.

In part because of a strong cultural aversion to donating blood, China is unusually reliant on paid sources. According to official statistics, which some experts consider understated, 40 percent of all blood used in China has been sold. In some provinces, 90 percent of the blood supply is purchased, according to the official press, which has carried lurid accounts of the blood trade and its sometimes disastrous consequences.
