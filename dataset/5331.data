In a major Kremlin shake-up that appears to strengthen the position of Mikhail S. Gorbachev as party leader, the Communist Party Central Committee dismissed three veteran members of the Politburo today.

The committee approved the retirement of Andrei A. Gromyko, who is the nation's titular President, from the Politburo, and ousted Anatoly F. Dobrynin, who had long served as Soviet Ambassador to the United States, from the post of Central Committee secretary.

Two important figures who have questioned Mr. Gorbachev's policies, Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2 party leader, and Viktor M. Chebrikov, the head of the K.G.B. intelligence and security agency, retained their Politburo posts but were given new party responsibilities in the reorganization that may diminish their influence. Broad Reorganization

Mr. Ligachev, the party ideologist, was replaced by Vadim A. Medvedev, 59 years old. Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 74, among the Politburo's senior figures, was also removed, The moves, which took place during an extraordinary one-hour meeting of the Communist Party's 300-member Central Committee, were accompanied by a sweeping reorganization of the party apparatus and the elevation to the Politburo of four new members. The results seemed to diplomats to reflect the most significant enhancement of Mr. Gorbachev's power since he took over as party General Secretary in March, 1985.
