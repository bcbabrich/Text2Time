A totally new screen design begins with a desktop even less useful than the one on the Mac, whose icons, folders and document orientation have been "borrowed," lock, stock and subdirectory. Desktop icons let you explore files on My Computer and in the Network Neighborhood. You can also click on a Recycle Bin, where deleted files are stored until you empty them; a Briefcase, which lets you pack files for travel; an electronic Inbox, which stores your mail and faxes, and, unless the Justice Department intervenes, the Microsoft Network on-line service.

The Start button at the bottom left of the screen launches a list of programs and documents. A Taskbar beside it shows what programs are currently running and is supposed to be visible at all times. But in just one of many maddening inconsistencies, multimedia programs often make the Taskbar mysteriously disappear.

User interfaces are highly personal. I found this one an improvement over Windows 3.1 but persistently irritating nonetheless. How do you call up a directory of your files? Click My Computer or Windows Explorer, which work quite differently from one another. There are many disparate ways to do things as simple as copying a file, but none works quite the way you expect it to, at least not until you discover the formerly dormant right mouse button. Where is the Shut Down option? On the Start button, of course!

You get used to these oddities. Windows 95 lets you customize look and feel to a fare-thee-well and adds useful features like a "find" utility, which helps track down files across multiple drives and directories. But unlike OS/2 Warp, the system can get befuddled if you delete or rename certain files.

As noted here on June 20, Windows 95 lets you use long file names like Letter to an Unknown Woman, but also truncates them into old-style "8-dot-3" directory entries like LETTER 1.DOC. The ability to use long file names, available on the Mac since 1984, is long overdue; unfortunately, current application software cannot view or manipulate them, and sending them across networks or to DOS or Windows 3.1 systems adds special problems. You cannot avoid them even if you want to: Windows 95 stores many of its own files under the new scheme.

Programs like Quicken and Turbotax handle few user-named files. But with most programs, the right but costly answer to the long-file-name perplex is to buy new software designed for Windows 95. Upgraded utility software is crucial. Current backup software, for example, cannot save long file names, and the inadequate Windows 95 backup program crashed repeatedly on my system.

Early tests of final versions here and in the July 24 issue of PC Week confirm that Windows 95 does not run current programs faster; if anything, it tends to slow them down a bit. In actual use, pluses and minuses seem randomly mixed. On my system, multimedia benchmark programs indicated significantly improved CD-ROM performance, but loading Encarta took nearly twice as long as it did before.
