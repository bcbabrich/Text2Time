Kloucek tore up his left knee here playing for the Rangers against the Thrashers on April 1, 2001.

Because of knee injuries and concussions, Kloucek may never become the player the Rangers once hoped he would. As for the 20-year-old Tyutin, Leetch said, ''There's only upside for him, and it's nice to see.''

Leetch, meanwhile, finds himself in the unfamiliar position of wondering whether he will be dealt to a contending team before the trading deadline, March 9.

If Leetch is traded, it is likely to be for the sort of prospects that the Rangers have failed to develop within their organization for several seasons. Tyutin, who was the Rangers' second-round draft choice (40th over all) in 2001, seems, for now, the exception.

''I remember telling our scouts that Fedor was, if not the best defenseman in the draft, then second best,'' said Tom Renney, who was the Rangers' director of player personnel when they drafted Tyutin. ''He was the guy I really wanted.''

Renney, who took over as the Rangers' coach when Glen Sather stepped down last week, said Sunday that Tyutin had the potential to play with the Rangers' top two defensive pairings as his career progresses.
