"Look at it this way," my mother used to say. "You get presents eight times, and they get them only once." But even she wasn't quite persuaded. One of the rare old home movies I have of my parents during the few years they were married to each other depicts a Kodak-perfect 1950's Christmas morning -- complete with glittering tree, red-and-green stockings and that most Protestant of gifts, a Lionel train.

Hanukkah is a tough sell in America. Though we did light the candles eight nights each year -- pyromania being another selling point to children in my family -- the Jews' Festival of Lights always seemed low-wattage next to the tree at Rockefeller Center, even as seen in black-and-white via the "Today" show.

True, Hanukkah is an inspiring tale of Jewish persistence, but anyone could see it was no Passover. My mother, who mocked Mother's Day as a fraud perpetrated by the greeting-card industry, eventually came to dismiss Hanukkah, too, as a commercial scam -- a minor holiday inflated by assimilated American Jews to compete with the majority culture around them.

If she was right, that effort is particularly lame this year. The Jewish calendar has rendered Hanukkah missing in action: already more than halfway gone, it's an afterthought to Thanksgiving rather than an alternative to the big Yuletide show. Jews who are still coping with turkey and brisket leftovers may not be up for dreidel-spinning. Nor, perhaps, are they eager for another elaborate family gathering at which certain in-laws might reopen hostilities brought to an uneasy cease-fire only last Thursday.
