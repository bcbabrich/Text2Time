The Spence family's case has prompted State Senator Peter A. Inverso, Assemblyman Paul R. Kramer, and Assemblywoman Barbara W. Wright, all Republicans, to introduce legislation that would make inmates like Mr. Spence ineligible for sentence reductions when they threaten their victims or violate restraining orders from prison.

''We're mandating language that says if certain circumstances occur, you may not give good behavior credit,'' said Ms. Wright, who noted that the proposed legislation is pending in committee. ''We happen to believe, based on the information that we have, that this person could be very dangerous to his family. We want to make sure this doesn't happen again.''

Sweethearts at Jamesburg High School, the Spences married when she was 17 and he was 18. Mrs. Spence said it was not uncommon for her husband to force her to have sex, but she said they were together 13 years before she realized that he also had sexually assaulted their children, other children in the neighborhood and even her own mother.

On one occasion, Mrs. Spence said, her husband raped her on the floor, in front of their children. Mr. Spence's children have recounted tales of repeated abuse by their father and, under duress, with one another. The couple's oldest daughter, Faizah, now 20, spent four years in a mental health clinic as a result of the abuse. The youngest daughter, Tahira, now an 18-year-old college student, has bouts with suicidal urges, her mother said. And on Tuesday night, Mrs. Spence said, she stayed up until 4 A.M. the next morning, consoling and trying to persuade her 25-year-old son that his own life was still worth living. ''He's a 6 foot 4 , handsome man,'' she said, ''but he's scared like a child.'' She said he blamed himself for the abuse inflicted on him by his father. ''He's so guilt-ridden he doesn't want to live anymore.''

To see her children in recent photos or look into Mrs. Spence's own eyes, there is little that betrays their anguished past or their current fears. A 43-year-old unemployed bus driver who has never earned more than $10,000 a year, Mrs. Spence has no money for a lawyer and is facing foreclosure on her house. ''I've had no electricity, no water, no heat many times,'' she said. ''I've raised my children below poverty level, but I've never impoverished their minds.'' Three of her children are in college; the other two are employed.
