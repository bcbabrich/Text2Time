The Interpublic Group of Companies and the Omnicom Group have both reported higher profits in the third quarter.

Interpublic posted net income of $8.1 million, or 24 cents a share, a 16.3 percent increase from $6.9 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11.6 percent, to $316 million, from $283.3 million in the 1989 quarter.

Omnicom posted net income of $6.7 million, or 26 cents a share, a 19.3 percent gain from $5.6 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 14.2 percent, to $281.6 million, from $246.6 million in the 1989 quarter.

"For Omnicom, this is very significant because the domestic environment has been very sluggish," said Karen R. Ficker, an industry analyst with Lee Sager & Company, in New York. "They've bucked the trend when most people were predicting revenues to be flat or down." She noted that several of Omnicom's leading clients had increased or maintained their ad budgets.
