The European Central Bank endorsed the candidacy of Jean-Claude Trichet, left, as its president. Mr. Trichet, the governor of the French central bank, is expected to succeed the current president, Wim Duisenberg, in November. The bank's governing council described Mr. Trichet, who was recently cleared by a French court of false-accounting charges, as a ''person of recognized standing and professional experience.''
