Merchandise creditors of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores reacted with general approval yesterday to the companies' reorganization plan because they would get the biggest share -- about $513 million -- of the $850 million in cash to be offered.

But they said that many problems in the plan, which was filed on Monday, must be resolved before they could give formal consent. A Federal judge cannot allow Federated and Allied to emerge from voluntary bankruptcy until at least 50 percent of each class of creditor, representing at least two-thirds of the class's debt, has approved the plan.

Federated and Allied filed for bankruptcy in January 1990. The Campeau Corporation acquired Federated in 1988 and Allied in 1986. The debt taken on in connection with the two acquisitions forced Federated and Allied into bankruptcy. The Remaining $337 Million

The remaining $337 million in cash would be distributed to other unsecured creditors, as well as to secured creditors, including banks and some premerger bondholders, along with notes and stock. Other bondholders, however, would be offered only stock in a new company, Federated Department Stores, which would emerge early next year as a combination of Federated and Allied's 244 department stores.
