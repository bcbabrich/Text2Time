''Social dynamite'' is one way to define poor children who lack education and sound parental supervision. ''Overwhelmed'' is a way to define poor mothers who lack education and self-esteem. How to help the children and the mothers is a question that can overwhelm, too - so much that it may induce paralysis even among the most well meaning.

To look at a parent-child educational program in San Antonio called Avance, however, is to get an answer. You start when the baby is born.

In 1970 a schoolteacher named Gloria Rodriguez, herself a child of the San Antonio barrios, was given her first class of first-graders. Young as they were, the school system had more or less given up on them: they'd been labeled ''retarded,'' ''slow'' or, even more finally, ''uneducable.''

Because they were all Hispanics Mrs. Rodriguez assumed that their problems lay in never having had a bilingual teacher before. Not so: the children were as deficient in Spanish as they were in English. And although Mrs. Rodriguez readied all but five for the second grade, it was clear even then that they would never really catch up. Their education had to begin when their lives began, with their parents as teachers. That's true for all children, but these parents didn't know how to do the job.
