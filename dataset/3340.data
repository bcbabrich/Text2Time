MONADNOCK MUSIC. Russell Sherman is one of the most technically formidable and musically probing pianists of our time. That said, his strong interpretive ideas frequently divide listeners. But he is always an interesting artist. This weekend, as part of the rewarding Monadnock Music festival, based in Peterborough, N.H., Mr. Sherman will perform all five Beethoven piano concertos on two programs with the Monadnock Music Festival Orchestra, conducted by James Bolle. Tonight he plays the first three concertos. On Sunday afternoon he offers the fourth and fifth. The performances are being recorded for future commercial release. Monadnock Music Festival. Peterborough Town House, Grove and Main Streets, Peterborough, N.H. Tonight at 8: Beethoven Piano Concertos Nos. 1 to 3; Sunday at 4 p.m.: Beethoven Piano Concertos Nos. 4 and 5. Tickets: $16 to $28; (603) 924-7610 (Tommasini).

MUSIC MOUNTAIN. It is hard to see why this attractive chamber-music festival, in its 71st season, has not developed a higher profile. Here, the Shanghai String Quartet offers two juicy programs (including music by Mozart, Beethoven, Shostakovich and Bright Sheng) and is joined by the pianist Ruth Laredo in a work of Brahms to end each. Tomorrow, it is Brahms's G-minor Piano Quartet, which these performers played impressively eight years ago at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and on Sunday it is Brahms's great and formidable Piano Quintet. A preconcert event ''The Return of the Canine Quadrille,'' at 2 on Sunday, is described as ''a congenial group of dogs dancing with their human partners.'' (Well, let's think again about that profile.) Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Music Mountain, Music Mountain Road, Falls Village, Conn., (860) 824-7126. Tickets: $18; $15 in advance; $10 for students (Oestreich).

NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. For the orchestra's annual Labor Day celebration, Takao Kanayama, its assistant conductor, leads a mixed bag of Americana, including the inevitable (''Stars and Stripes Forever'' and ''America the Beautiful'') and the less so (excerpts from Schuman's ''New England Triptych,'' selections from Bernstein's ''West Side Story'' and the Scherzo from Still's ''Afro-American Symphony''). Sunday at 8 p.m., Capitol West Lawn, Washington, (202) 467-4600 or (800) 444-1324. Admission: free (Oestreich).

SKANEATELES FESTIVAL. Now that most other summer festivals have pulled up stakes, it may be time to dig out the map and start exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, near Syracuse, this event is directed by Diane Walsh, a pianist. Tonight, Ms. Walsh spars with the theatrical comic Bill Irwin in spoofs including ''The Page Turner,'' which, for longtime concertgoers, let alone some of us forcibly retired page turners, may be hard put to rival real and legendary disasters. Tomorrow, Peter Bay conducts the festival orchestra to close the season with -- what else? -- Haydn's ''Farewell'' Symphony (though surely, to savor the exquisite joke of the players dispersing a few at a time, the work should come at the end of the program, not before intermission) along with Mozart arias and Schubert's Fifth Symphony. Tonight at 8, Skaneateles High School, East Elizabeth Street; tomorrow night at 8, Brook Farm, Route 41A, south of Skaneateles, (315) 685-7418. Tickets: tonight, $10 to $16; tomorrow, $20 and $25; free to children under 13 (Oestreich).
