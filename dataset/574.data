Less than two blocks downwind from the smoldering waterfront, MatchaBar, a cafe on Wythe Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, opened on Sunday after the dissipation of the acrid, ash-filled smoke that kept it closed on Saturday.

A group of painters, musicians and web designers, who smelled slightly charred, sipped coffee in the early afternoon and traded gossip about the fire at the CitiStorage warehouse. One had to leave his home. Another put on a raggedy coat so his favorite one would not get fumigated. Everyone was suspicious of how the fire started.

Lisa Markuson, 28, a poet with hair dyed royal blue, perched by the window with a Smith Corona typewriter, sipped from a cup of bright green tea, and offered the quaintest commentary. She typed haiku, onto 3-inch-by-5-inch note cards, and gave them away. Her ode to the fire:

we’re all pretty sure

that this was no accident

smoke clouds our vision

“It’s on all our minds,” said Ms. Markuson, who lives in Greenpoint.

Jay Braun, 43, an audio producer who owns a recording studio in a building next to the warehouse, told of racing through the smoke to throw protective covers over all his equipment.

“It was like Mount St. Helens,” he said. “My car smells like smoked Gouda now.”

Max Fortgang, 25, one of the cafe’s founders, apologized to a few hardy customers who tried to come Saturday, and found the door locked. The smoke, he said, was just too thick.

“We were really nervous about smoke and ash getting in the building,” he said. “I was feeling a little lightheaded.”

A regular pulled up in a maroon sedan frozen inside a full inch of glistening white ice. A resident of a building next to the warehouse, he had left his car near where firefighters had set up hoses.

“I’m sure it’s just some freak accident, but the timing still seems sort of sketch to me,” said the 28-year-old man, who declined to give his name because he lived near the fire and was forced from his home.

As he walked out to meet his father, with an ice scraper to free the car, he said loud enough for everyone in the cafe to hear, “I’d like to see the sky rise they build there.”
