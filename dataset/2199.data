No sooner does Michael Schumacher have his first very bad result this season – finishing eleventh in qualifying today – then talk about his future at Ferrari comes up again. Schumacher certainly sounded baffled about his results in Melbourne today. But his future could prove to be even more complicated to figure out. During his whole career in Formula One he has been linked to the same key people at both Benetton and Ferrari, namely Ross Brawn, the technical director, and Rory Byrne, the car designer.

Last year there was speculation that Schumacher would move to McLaren-Mercedes next year – but now Fernando Alonso has signed with McLaren and the speculation is aiming elsewhere. An interesting story on the grandprix.com web site today describes the perfect marriage as Schumacher joining Renault next year and with Heikki Kovalainen, the young Finn who is the team’s third driver this year, as the other driver.

The story makes a very good argument, even if some people would be excused for wondering if there is a link between the date at the top of the article and the content of the article. Is the idea of Schumacher going to Renault and rejoining his former Benetton team director, Flavio Briatore, and many of the same people, including Pat Symonds, the engineering director, nothing more than an April Fool’s Day joke?

It is difficult to imagine Renault paying anything close to the kind of money Schumacher is used to being paid.

In any case, the idea of Schumacher moving to any new team next year at the age of 38 raises a very important question. Over this weekend in Melbourne, Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher’s former teammate at Ferrari, has talked about the difficulties he has been having adapting to his new car and team at Honda. Juan Pablo Montoya remarked on his own problems adapting at McLaren-Mercedes in his first year there last year.

Drivers generally need at least a year to adapt to a new team. There are exceptions. Alain Prost took a year off racing in 1992 and then joined Williams , where he had never raced before, and won the title in 1993. He then retired. But Prost joined Williams at a time when the car was by far the strongest machine. Prost, too, like Schumacher next year, was 38.

But Schumacher will have been with Ferrari for 11 seasons by the end of 2006. He is known for his ability to adapt quickly, but he will nevertheless need time. And the new season has shown that despite Renault’s success, several other teams are also very strong. Today, a Honda scored pole position ahead of the two Renaults.

At 38, could Schumacher afford a transition year? Does Schumacher have a future anywhere but Ferrari?
