In the last year, Donald J. Trump has bought the St. Moritz Hotel, opened a huge gambling casino in Atlantic City, taken over the largest tract of undeveloped land in Manhattan, offered to build a $250 million sports stadium in Queens and the world's tallest building in Manhattan, and signed the country's leading college quarterback, Doug Flutie, to play for his football team.

Yesterday, Mr. Trump announced that oil had been discovered off 72d Street on his large undeveloped tract - the site of the old West Side rail yards.

''Isn't it amazing?'' Mr. Trump said. ''It's a classic major oil find in Manhattan.''

But if gushers, wildcatters and roughnecks are standard features of a classic oil find, Mr. Trump's discovery ranks as something else. His oil was deposited on the site through spills and leaks over much of the last century.

And to the Coast Guard and the State Department of Environmental Conservation, the deposit is more of a potential environmental hazard than a major strike.
