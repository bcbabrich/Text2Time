Still suffering from the lower back spasms that kept him out of the Nets' last two games on their West Coast trip last week, Derrick Coleman didn't practice with his teammates yesterday. His status was listed as day-to-day. The Nets' next game is tomorrow night against the Atlanta Hawks at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.

The 6-foot-10-inch Jayson Williams, who has a sprained left ankle he suffered in Saturday night's victory over the Kings in Sacramento, is definitely out for tomorrow's game, so if Coleman is unable to play, the Nets will have only one true power forward, Rick Mahorn, available.

The Nets, however, have been getting along splendidly without the 6-10 Coleman by playing 6-11 backup center Chris Dudley at the big forward spot with 7-1 center Sam Bowie and 6-8 small forward Chris Morris, and Mahorn contributing his savvy.

"It doesn't matter to Chuck Daly -- he'll play anybody who can get the job done," the Nets' assistant coach, Paul Silas, said of the team's head coach. "I think Chuck just has a great, great way of motivating and not talking a lot."
