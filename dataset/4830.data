Round 1 of Cecil versus Jose goes to . . . Mark McGwire.

McGwire's three-run home run with two out in the 10th inning Friday night gave the Oakland Athletics a 6-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in a battle of the home run hitters.

For McGwire, who's been hitting around .200 most of the season, this might have been the hardest ball he has hit all year, a shot that landed a dozen rows into the left-field bleachers.

"He's had the kind of season that's been a struggle," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said. "He gets it, then he goes. I know he doesn't feel real natural at the plate. But when you see it, you see what he's capable of."

The teams who are first and third in the American League in home runs lived up to their billing. All nine runs came on six homers.
