THE Rev. Molly Paine McGreevy is not at all a stereotypical minister or mother of the bride. She has worn almost every imaginable hat. She has been a stay-at-home mom, a Pop Art collector, a regular on the soap opera ''Ryan's Hope'' and most recently, an Episcopal priest.

From 1986 to 1995, she worked at the Church of St. Luke in the Fields in Greenwich Village, spiritually guiding her parish ioners through the AIDS crisis, which had hit the neighborhood hard.

On May 18, Ms. McGreevy, now an associate priest at St. Francis' Episcopal Church in Stamford, Conn., returned to St. Luke's to co-officiate with Rabbi Joseph H. Gelberman at the wedding of her eldest daughter, Pamela Paine McGreevy, 36.

Her mother and her friends liken the bride to a character in a Jane Austen novel: bright-eyed, alabaster-skinned, smart and sensible. She and her mother are very close, but they say they are not at all alike.
