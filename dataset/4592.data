Yale Newman, a pioneer in international television news and a former Foreign Service officer, died on Monday at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 68 years old.

He died of amyloidosis, a disease that attacks the body's tissues and organs, a family member said.

Mr. Newman, the chief European correspondent for ABC News from 1953 to 1963, was the London producer of "The Valiant Years," the Emmy Award-winning 26-part television documentary based on Winston Churchill's memoirs of World War II. He also created the "International Town Meeting of the Air," a trans-Atlantic television show.

He joined the Foreign Service in 1966, serving as public affairs officer. He was also director of Voice of America's service to Latin America and the Caribbean. He retired from Foreign Service in 1986 and was a public affairs consultant at his death.

His first marriage ended in divorce.

He is survived by his second wife, Jo Ann; two sons, Russell of New York City and Daniel of Rochester; two daughters, Joanne of Washington and Dianne of Alexandria, and two brothers, Saul of Apalachin, N.Y., and Joseph of Washington.
