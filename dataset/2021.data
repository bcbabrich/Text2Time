My football allegiances are to the Philadelphia Eagles, though, considering my recent travel itinerary, I suspect you could call me a Saints fan: St. Lucie to St. Petersburg to St. Louis, and let me say, it’s great being here at Busch Stadium for opening day. All the seats here are red, although with seemingly everyone wearing the same color, it’s tough to tell who’s standing or sitting.

This is my second opening day as a beat writer, and the third one I’ve covered, and it never ceases to amaze me how subdued the clubhouse is beforehand. When I walked in the Mets’ clubhouse at 3:40 CDT, this is what I saw:

*Jose Reyes and Lastings Milledge sitting reading copies of Baseball America.

*Jose Valentin plopped in front of his locker working on a SuDoku puzzle.

*Ambiorix Burgos breaking in his glove in front of his locker with headphones on.

*Aaron Sele, feet up on a shelf, reading “Crossroads of Twilight“.

*Endy Chavez playing golf on his PSP.

*Paul Lo Duca on a couch trying to watch golf on one TV and the Suns-Mavericks game on another.

*Tom Glavine munching on some Cheerios.

In other news, the Cardinals are honoring their 1982 world championship team tonight, and Keith Hernandez, the SNY broadcaster and former Met, was introduced. During our pregame interview session with Willie Randolph, the manager was incredulous that Hernandez was taking part as a Cardinal and then, in a week, was throwing out the first pitch at the Mets’ home opener.

“He’s a Met; he’s not a Cardinal,” Randolph said.
