The Queens District Attorney, John J. Santucci, called upon a Supreme Court justice yesterday to put on trial a 64year‐old man charged with murder and arson, who had obtained more than 50 postponements because of a serious heart condition.

In arguing for the trial, Martin Bracken, an assistant district attorney who is in charge of homicide cases, told Justice George Balbach of Supreme Court:

“The defendant's claim is without merit, for it would confer immunity upon him from criminal prosecution not only for the indictment herein but for all past, present and, for that matter, future conduct.

“Moreover, by the defendant's reasoning, any defendant with a similar condition, regardless of the number and nature of the crime or crimes, would be immune from criminal sanctions by reason of physical illness.”

The defendant, Samuel Piazza of 214‐15 86th Avenue, Queens Village, was charged with having collaborated with his son, William, in hiring a handyman to firebomb three stores that the elder Mr. .Pizza owned at 218th Street and Jamaica Avenue, Queens Village. The buildings were firebombed on March 15, 1973. Subsequently, the body of John Donnelly, alleged to have been hired to destroy the buildings, was found in the wreckage.
