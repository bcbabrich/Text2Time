Elliott Merrick, a writer, editor, teacher, farmer and sailor who distilled his experiences into acclaimed, enduring books about Labrador and northern Vermont, died on April 22 at his home in Asheville, N.C.. He was 91.

His ''Northern Nurse'' (1942) told the epic tale of Kate Austen, an Australian nurse he met and married in remotest Labrador, where he journeyed in 1929 to teach at a mission school. The book was on national best-seller lists for months.

Mr. Merrick's last novel was ''Green Mountain Farm'' (1948), a tale of farm life in northern Vermont, where he and his wife took refuge during the Depression. It remains in print today, as do ''The Long Crossing and Other Labrador Stories'' and his very first book, ''True North,'' a diary about living in Goose Bay, Labrador, originally published in 1933.

Elliott Tucker Merrick 3d was born in Montclair, N.J., and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale University. He tried newspaper work in Passaic, N.J., and a lucrative advertising job in Manhattan and hated both.
