George T. Skibine, an assistant secretary of economic development for Indian affairs at the Department of the Interior, said that the dormant proposal for a Mohawk casino at the racetrack could be revived if the governor sent a letter concurring with his agency's findings in 2000 that the casino would be good for both the tribe and Sullivan County.

Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, and Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, said that it was up to Mr. Pataki to approve the latest Mohawk proposal, since he has the authority to negotiate three casino deals in the Catskills under legislation approved in 2001.

Despite the apparent support for a Mohawk casino, construction is not necessarily going to begin anytime soon, if ever. Gambling in the Catskills has been a political roller coaster with unending twists and turns, and the racetrack is no exception.

Empire Resorts and the Mohawks have been partners before. In the 1990's, the tribe and the company, formerly known as Alpha Hospitality, proposed building a casino on 29 acres at the racetrack. Although casino gambling is illegal in New York, it is permitted on Indian-owned land.

But days after the Interior Department granted the project tentative approval in 2000, the Mohawks surprised supporters, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, when the tribe dropped its partners in favor of a large gambling company, Park Place Entertainment.

At that time, executives at Park Place, which has since merged with Harrah's Entertainment, said they would obtain federal approval and build a Mohawk casino at Kutsher's Sports Academy, outside Monticello. But that still has not happened.

In 2001, the Legislature authorized Mr. Pataki to negotiate deals for three Indian casinos in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area and three in the Catskills, which gambling enthusiasts viewed as a plum location because of its proximity to New York City.
