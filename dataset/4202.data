Since the 1970's, the Queens Museum of Art has held biennial or triennial exhibitions of work by artists based in Queens. The most recent entry in this series, "Live/Work in Queens," reflects the borough's transformation into what the show's curator, Christina Yang, calls "the nation's most diverse county," one that includes more than 70 ethnic groups speaking almost 200 different languages. Four of the eight artists in the show were born in the United States, but the others come from Colombia, China, Korea and Afghanistan. Not surprisingly, the exhibition seems to revolve around the theme of ethnic identity.

The problem is that the artistic representation of ethnicity too often turns into self-caricature. The relief paintings of Esperanza Cortes, for instance, evoke the image of the Hispanic woman as wife, mother and martyr by means of an all-too-familiar vocabulary of fractured body parts rendered with sugary realism. Artists should either come to grips with the sado-masochistic subtext of this imagery or -- better yet -- give it a rest.

Katherine O'Connor's black-and-white photographs of the Irish village from which her father emigrated are full of soulful, melancholy faces whose lines and creases reveal their long struggle with mortality and the elements. This nostalgic view of life in the Old Country is rendered in a pseudo-clinical style that recalls photographers like Nicholas Nixon and Larry Fink but that lacks their formal wit and daring.

Other artists here take a more indirect approach to identity. Amanullah Haiderzad, who left Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of 1980, makes iron sculptures that echo the characters of Arabic calligraphy without literally reproducing them. Their planar, strongly textured forms are curiously reminiscent of work by such American sculptors of the 1940's and 50's as David Smith, Herbert Ferber and Seymour Lipton.
