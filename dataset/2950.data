Lewis Katz, the Nets' principal owner, wrested the trophy from the hands of the team president, Rod Thorn, and just held onto it for dear life.

He passed it to Kidd, who kissed it. One hour after the Nets' victory, Katz had the trophy back, still cradling it, not wanting to part with it. ''I'm speechless,'' he said.

''I knew we were good, to get to the finals, in one year, I didn't think we could do that. It's tremendous,'' Harris said.

Kidd, when it counted most, finished 15 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists.

''I think Jason in the back of his mind felt like he had something to prove, just like the rest of us,'' Van Horn said.

Van Horn and Kittles never stopped making key contributions in this series. They completed the most crucial play of the game. With the Nets leading by 91-88, Kittles was falling out of bounds on the left baseline when he flipped a pass to Van Horn at the top of the arc. Van Horn, waiting patiently, had just visualized the moment, his 26-footer falling through the net with 50 seconds. The Celtics were done.

''I saw the play develop, right when Kerry drove,'' Van Horn said. ''I knew I was going to get the shot. The history of their defense was that they collapse. I anticipated the whole play, but I didn't expect Kerry to make the pass with his left hand falling out of bounds. There aren't a whole lot of guys in the league that can do that.''

When Kidd hit two free throws with 33.9 seconds left, the Celtics' season was over.

Thorn was overcome with emotion in the locker room, recalling the final minute of the game after Van Horn's shot. ''I was almost out of body, to tell you the truth,'' Thorn said. ''Guys were congratulating me all around. I was like, 'Are you crazy?' After that last game Saturday we played up here, it's not over with until the last second is ticking down.
