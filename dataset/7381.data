SAIGON, South Vietnam, Dec. 31—Buddhist leaders met today in a national convention whose purpose was to unify the Vietnamese Buddhists and to thresh out their political course.

Although the speakers' references to politics were veiled, young Buddhist monks, who gained their first taste of political action in demonstrations against the late President Ngo Dinh Diem earlier this year, made plain they intended to weld Buddhism into a powerful and permanent political force.

“The experiences of recent months have shown us that social events can deeply influence religious life because Buddhists are at the same time citizens of the country” declared Thich Tam Chau, chairman of the intersect committee, which led the religious and political movement that helped overthrow the Diem regime.

Another speaker, Thich Thien Minh, called for a systematic organization of Buddhism. “Out of experience the Buddhists must be realistic,” he said. “They should not consider religion as a vague doctrine but as a real organization.”
