Protests over Moscow's delay in announcing the nuclear accident were particularly sharp from Sweden and Denmark.

Prime Minister Poul Schluter of Denmark said, ''It is totally unacceptable and unsatisfactory that we can come to experience such a great, tragic nuclear power accident without the governments in the neighboring states being informed about what happened.''

Sweden's Energy Minister, Birgitta Dahl, said her Government was preparing ''a list of demands with regard to the Soviet Union,'' noting that these would include steps to improve safety at nuclear plants. Previous requests by Sweden for the Soviet Union to improve plant safety have been ignored, Government officials say.

Apparently trying to limit the diplomatic damage, the Soviet Ambassador met with Swedish officials today and pledged to provide more complete information about any further troubles at the Chernobyl plant.
