The United States economy grew at its slowest rate in more than five years during the final quarter of 2000, as businesses abruptly cut their spending on new equipment, the government said yesterday.

American consumers continued to increase their purchases, albeit more slowly than earlier in the year, allowing the gross domestic product to grow at an annual pace of 1.4 percent during the quarter. Government spending, particularly on the military, also rose, while economic weakness around the globe caused foreign countries to trim their purchases of American goods.

The Commerce Department's quarterly report depicted the $10.1 trillion United States economy verging on a slowdown or a recession. Growth remained faster than it had been in the first half of 1995, when the country avoided a recession and the economy then entered one of its best five-year periods in history.

But over the final three months of 2000, personal consumption was the only part of the private sector that expanded, and in the early weeks of this year consumer confidence has plummeted, according to two major surveys.
