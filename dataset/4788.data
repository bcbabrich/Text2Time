The United Nations Secretary General recommended today that the Baghdad Government pay up to 30 percent of its annual oil revenue as reparations for the invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf war.

Iraq agreed to pay reparations out of current oil revenues as part of the terms of the gulf war cease-fire. But in a letter this month to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Baghdad asked for a five-year moratorium on reparations payments to give it time to rebuild its shattered economy. That request is under study by the United Nations Compensation Fund, which received the Secretary General's recommendation and will determine what the actual payment level will be.

Iraq has not been permitted to resume oil exports since the end of the war, pending United Nations certification of its compliance with other sections of the cease-fire agreement.

A reparations figure of 20 to 30 percent of oil revenues had been widely expected, even though the United States had called for a ceiling of as much as 50 percent. It was assumed that the American figure was a negotiating stance to offset figures as low as 5 percent proposed by Security Council members sympathetic to Iraq like Cuba. Ceiling Set by OPEC
