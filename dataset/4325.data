To understand why the long-distance company Sprint is eager to merge with the computer-services provider E.D.S., talk to a potential customer, Jim DiGiore.

As the manager of information systems at Empire of America Realty, a mortgage company based in Buffalo, Mr. DiGiore has developed a high-speed computer network that links lending officers in 20 cities. Loan applications, home appraisals and credit reports fly across the network electronically as the company seeks to speed up loan approvals and pull in more business.

But like many corporate information managers, Mr. DiGiore would like to do more. Computer companies, for example, have been showing him systems that would let Empire's agents in different cities look at images of a document and converse through video windows on their computer screens.

"The problem is that you have one person who writes the computer applications and a different person who sets up the communication lines," said Mr. DiGiore, who currently uses the MCI Corporation for long-distance service. "We can do a yeoman's job of talking to the computer vendors, but they don't have a clue about how to move things from Washington to New York."
