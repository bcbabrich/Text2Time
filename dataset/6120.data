October sales among six of New York City's biggest retailers rose only moderately over the month a year ago, the gains, averaging 4.5 percent, just about matching the inflation rate in department‐store merchandise.

Warmer weather than in the 1976 month kept October's sales from rising more, according to industry experts, adversely affecting consumer interest in cold‐weather apparel, particularly coats and other outerwear.

Also, the October business compared with a particularly strong 1976 month, when sales were the strongest of the year. Sales in New York City had risen 8.6 percent in October 1976, in great part aided by extremely cold weather.

City Gains Exceed Regions

Although last month's retail volume in the city was generally not strong, the gain again topped the trend in the greater metropolitan area, indicating that suburban stores were not doing as well as those in the city. Sales among stores in the area rose only 2.4 percent over last year, a spot‐check found.
