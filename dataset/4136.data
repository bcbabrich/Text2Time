The jacket he wore was a keepsake, with a year-old logo and the word "Charlotte" on its sleeves, a reminder of the weekend that Arkansas became national champions, Nolan Richardson reached the top of his profession and the President led the cheers.

As he approached the end of a year that has held as much frustration and scrutiny as a 31-6 season can bring, Richardson's voice sounded softer and more reflective today than it did through this weekend last year. No matter how much Richardson issues the same reminder to the Razorbacks, he understands that two weekends, last year and this year, have become connected by the achievements of the same five starters and the expectations that have followed.

"I tell them at the end of the ball game," Richardson remembered, " 'at 12 midnight, fellas, forget what happened yesterday. We've got a new day, and a new game, with different people.' "

The days are new but the Arkansas standard has become a constant. Richardson's message may never face as severe a test as the one this weekend, in the Final Four that holds as much tradition as expectation. The Razorbacks will meet North Carolina (28-5), in its 12th Final Four appearance and first since the 1993 championship, 30 minutes after 10-time champion U.C.L.A. concludes its game against Oklahoma State. That game begins at 5:42 P.M. Eastern Time.
