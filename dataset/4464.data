The doors to the Mets' clubhouse were closed for nearly an hour. When they opened, players emerged without speaking, the manager came out visibly drained by the meeting, the top-ranking organization official walked off smiling politely, but grimly.

"It feels like August," said Gerry Hunsicker, the director of baseball operations.

For the Mets, the August heat in April only got worse hours later. In a game of blown leads, substandard pitching, a dreadful inning and more agony for Anthony Young, the Mets were defeated, 7-6, by the San Diego Padres. Ominous Karma

The defeat, the sixth straight for the Mets and the 17th in succession charged to Young, was sealed in the seventh. With Sid Fernandez gone after being banged around for nine hits in five innings, Mike Draper and Mike Maddux made their own trouble and then were sabotaged by yet more bad defense. With the Mets leading by 5-3, Draper gave up a run-scoring double to Tony Gwynn, and then Maddux came on, hit Fred McGriff with a pitch and then lost Derek Bell to a walk.

The karma was ominous for the Mets, and disaster detonatd when shortstop Tony Fernandez, who has one of the best fielding percentages in the game, was charged with a throwing error on a Jeff Gardner grounder that would have ended the inning. First baseman Eddie Murray hardly distinguished himself on the play, failing to handle or knock down the baseball. Two more runs were across and the Padres had their first lead.
