But the gasoline tax has at least two big drawbacks that the already well-mobilized opposition has been pointing out at every chance. First, it would hurt the poor more than the well-to-do; second, it discriminates against people in rural areas who must travel longer distances. Moreover, some experts argue that the yield from an increased tax on gasoline would be offset in part by a decline in other revenue caused by what they argue would be the new tax's chilling effect on the economy.

Despite backing from such diverse policymakers as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and head of the Ways and Means Committee, and Mr. Lewis of the Economic Commission, it is uncertain whether more than a token increase can be enacted, unless it is combined with some other revenue source.

Among the strongest critics of a rise in the gas tax are state officials who fear that a higher Federal levy will limit their ability to raise those taxes in the future. Gasoline tax increases are also opposed by the oil industry, trucking groups, road builders, farm groups and the American Automobile Association. TAPPING OIL

Imposing a fee on imported oil is especially appealing to some people, notably domestic oil producers. Such a tax, say $5 or $10 a barrel, would, like the gasoline tax, help the trade balance and address worries about the growing dependence on foreign sources of energy.

But the import fee has several drawbacks. One is that it would raise domestic oil prices, resulting in a windfall for the American oil industry rather than increased revenues for the Government. Another point against the fee is that it would put the American petrochemical industry at a competitive disadvantage.

Regional politics also plays a role. The Northeast and other areas that use large quantities of imported oil in power-generating plants would be adversely affected. On the other hand, an import fee cannot be entirely dismissed while so many Texas politicians - Mr. Bush and Mr. Wright among others - hold prominent positions in the Government.

Two other energy taxes may also figure in the debate. One possibility would be to devise some sort of broad energy tax based on, say, the energy content of a given fuel. Another, supported by Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, would be related to exhaust emissions, an idea that coal interests hope will not go far. CASHING IN ON 'SIN'
