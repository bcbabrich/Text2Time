In my Sunday column, I argue that the paramount need for the new president is to end America’s self-exile and rejoin the world. I start by looking at the unscientific survey of professional historians by History News Network that found that 61 percent rated George W. Bush the very worst president in our history. That fascinated me because I had always thought that James Buchanan, on the eve of the Civil War, was about as awful a leader as could emerge in a democracy; surely in a more educated age with better communications, an equally bad leader could never emerge. Well according to the historians, one did.

So a couple of points for discussion. How would you rate Bush, and why? Does he really exceed Buchanan — not to mention Andrew Johnson, who frustrated Reconstruction, or Franklin Pierce and Millard Fillmore? My own vote is for second worst, after Buchanan, whose dithering helped lead to the Civil War.

Also, how do we rejoin the world? I list a few approaches, including turning Guantanamo prison into a tropical disease facility and starting a Truth Commission; stretching our diplomatic muscles; and resuming humanitarian cooperation, particularly in reproductive health. Obama would be good at these areas, but would pose some risks on trade; in general, foreigners overwhelmingly want Obama to win, but they are nervous that he has a protectionist bone. And any other suggestions you have for how we can rejoin the world? Please post below.
