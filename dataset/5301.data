AGB Television Research, which took on the A. C. Nielsen Company in a costly war for the business of measuring the American television audience, has surrendered and will suspend its ratings operation in the United States.

AGB spent $67 million in its effort to replace Nielsen as the standard used by the television networks and the advertising industry. Its hopes were based on a hand-held electronic audience measuring device called a ''people meter,'' which AGB's parent company, Audits of Great Britain, invented a decade ago.

But Nielsen, which for decades had a near-monopoly on the national television ratings business in this country, developed its own people meter system to counter AGB's and exploited its dominant position in the marketplace to prevent AGB from gaining a foothold.

AGB also announced on Friday a tentative agreement to acquire Mediamark Research Inc., a large market research firm based in New York, from MAI P.L.C., a British financial, media and information services company. Costs Exceeded Estimates
