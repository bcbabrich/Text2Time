Governor Spitzer said in his inaugural address that, “Like Rip Van Winkle, the legendary character created by the New York author Washington Irving, New York has slept through much of the past decade while the rest of the world has passed us by.’’

It seemed to produce a little unease in the first row of guest sitting up on the stage with him, which included Gov. George E. Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader.

But maybe it was just Rip Van Payback. After Mr. Spitzer first unveiled the “Day One, Everything Chnages” theme during his speech last June at the Democratic convention in Buffalo, it was a spokesman for Governor Pataki who said, “After almost eight years as Shelly Silver’s silent partner in Albany, Rip Van Spitzer today awoke from his slumber to talk about ethics in government.’’

Maybe now we can put the allusion back to sleep for another 20 years.
