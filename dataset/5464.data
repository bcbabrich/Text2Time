Angel Cordero Jr. rode Over All to her third straight stakes victory on closing day at Saratoga Race Track today, but the 44-year-old rider still fell four victories short of winning his 12th consecutive riding title here.

Cordero ended the 24-day Saratoga meeting with 22 victories, but Jose Santos, the brilliant 26-year-old Chilean jockey who led the nation in earnings last year, won 26 races to break Cordero's 11-year hold on the Saratoga title.

''If I had to lose, I'm glad it was to Jose,'' Cordero said today. ''They call him the next Cordero, and he deserved it this month. I'll get him next year.''

Over All, a D. Wayne Lukas-trained daughter of Mr. Prospector, became the first filly since Talking Picture in 1972 to sweep Saratoga's stakes series for 2-year-old fillies. She won the opening-day Schuylerville Aug. 5, the Adirondack Aug. 20 and scored by 4 1/4 lengths in the $168,900 Spinaway today. Sent off the 3-to-10 favorite in a field of four, she ran the six furlongs in 1:11 for her fifth victory in seven career starts. Bold Lady Anne finished second, followed by Flashy Runner and Justsayno.
