For Republican candidates, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is a favorite target these days — the San Francisco liberal and leader of the Democratic incumbents that the insurgent, resurgent G.O.P. challengers want to oust. But as vilified as she may be at times, Ms. Pelosi is planning an aggressive itinerary to raise money for individual Democratic candidates and for her party as whole in the closing weeks of the campaign.

This weekend, Ms. Pelosi will speak at fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in New York and Los Angeles, according to her office. She will then attend committee fund-raising dinners with President Obama on Oct. 11 in Coral Gables, Fla., and on Oct. 23 in Minneapolis, and another with the first lady, Michelle Obama, in San Francisco on Oct. 25.

In addition, she will visit a local manufacturer in San Francisco on Wednesday to talk about the Democrats’ “Make it in America” agenda, and she will address the United Steel Workers’ “Women of Steel” conference in Pittsburgh on Oct. 18. All in all, the news bulletin said, Ms. Pelosi will visit eight states for 25 fund-raising events with 21 Democratic lawmakers between now and the Nov. 2 election.

Ms. Pelosi’s office said it was not releasing details about her other destinations, in keeping with longstanding security procedures and noting that other events could be added to her schedule. But given that five of the eight states are New York, California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Minnesota, it seemed likely that Ms. Pelosi would be making repeat visits to Democratic strongholds and steer clear of regions where she could cause political problems for Democratic candidates.
