Two lawyers who have had an indelible impact on General Motors, past and present, were on hand Monday when it took its first steps into bankruptcy.

Sitting in the front row at Fritz Henderson’s news conference, held in what is normally the dining room of the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges were Harvey R. Miller (right), who is leading G.M.’s bankruptcy case, and Ira M. Millstein, the attorney who counseled G.M.’s outside directors in a 1992 boardroom coup.

Mr. Miller slipped out of the room at the end, presumably to gather his things for a trip downtown (we’ll catch up with him later). But Mr. Millstein hung around to chat jovially with a handful of journalists. For some, it was the first opportunity to meet a legendary figure in G.M. history. Mr. Millstein was instrumental in the decision by G.M.’s board to divide the duties of chairman and chief executive, and give the chairman’s job to an outside director.

That practice was short-lived and went away in 1996 when John F. Smith Jr., who had been named chief executive in 1992, assumed the chairman’s job. The two positions also were held by Rick Wagoner, until he was dismisssed in March by the Obama adminsitration. His successor, Mr. Henderson, will not be getting the chairman’s title, which has gone to Kent Kresa on an interim basis.

A few hours after Mr. Millstein held court, Mr. Miller was in court, leading a case that attorneys at Weil first began to prepare last fall.

During his opening remarks, Mr. Miller emphasized what he called the company’s “herculean effort” to preserve the value of its assets. He stressed the dire state of the American auto industry. “As far as the automotive industry is concerned, this is the worst of times since World War II,” he said.

In putting G.M. through its paces in bankruptcy court, Mr. Miller was true to form, consistently courteous to Judge Robert E. Gerber with insistent references to “your honor” and “sir.”

He was also gracious to others, notably to Andrew Rosenberg, the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison lawyer who represents a committee of some of G.M.’s largest bondholders. After Mr. Rosenberg spoke in support of G.M.’s restructuring plan, noting that a new offer to his clients had wrung the support of 54 percent of G.M.’s bond debt, Mr. Miller returned to the podium to say, “This is a monumental step forward from where we were a week ago.”

While Mr. Miller said in court that he didn’t want to follow exactly in the footsteps of Chrysler, which has moved closer to moving most of its operations out of bankruptcy — but only after a bruising set of marathon hearings — he needn’t have worried on Monday. Judge Gerber swiftly approved G.M.’s raft of first-day hearings, and even granted interim approval of the carmaker’s proposed sale and debtor-in-possession financing with minimum fuss.
