Senator D'Amato, who was a member of the conference committee, issued a statement last night saying he was ''absolutely outraged that this was not brought up in committee because it was neither in the House nor the Senate spending bill and a matter of this importance should have been brought to the table.''

Senator Moynihan said that he was not aware of the legislation until yesterday and that he felt he should have been notified in advance. ''They should have told us - they damned well should,'' he said, adding that he would have objected to the measure. 'Actively Seeking Buyers'

Mr. Murdoch's only comment came Wednesday night in a terse statement: ''We have been actively seeking buyers for The Post for several weeks and are currently in negotiations. No decisions have been reached about Boston.''

Under a waiver granted by the Federal Communications Commission, Mr. Murdoch has until March 6 to comply with the commission rule prohibiting cross-ownership by disposing of either The New York Post or WNYW-TV, Channel 5. Similarly, he has until June 30 to dispose of either The Herald or WFXT-TV in Boston.

Mr. Murdoch had sought to persuade the commission to relax or change the rule so that he might keep both newspapers and both television stations, spokesmen for Mr. Murdoch said.

Senator Hollings attached language to the catch-all appropriations bill that would not allow the commission ''to repeal, to retroactively apply changes in, or to begin or continue a re-examination of the rules of the F.C.C. with respect to the common ownership of a daily newspaper and a television station'' in the same market.

The new statute also forbids further extensions of any waivers from the cross-ownership rule. Mr. Murdoch has the only waivers now in effect. 'To Bring It to a Head'
