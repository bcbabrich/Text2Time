Even the candy dishes are filled: M & M's are piled on majolica cake stands, antique glass canisters are stocked with miniature candy bars and a copper lusterware tea set is filled with saltwater taffy.

''The Pantzers wanted chintz and antiques and porcelain and all the twinkle,'' Mrs. Kravis said. ''We wanted restraint and all of the above. The idea was for people to come into the house and feel welcome, but not overwhelmed.''

The prescription given the decorators was not easy, considering the size of the peaked-roof house. It has a living room 37 feet long and 28 feet wide; a wide, columned terrace, and a formal paneled dining room. The house, according to Mrs. Kravis, was ''so big that it swallowed up everything.''

That meant a lot of interior decorating in a short time.

During Christmas week, the decorators selected and reserved fabrics. ''Carrying floor plans of the house,'' Mrs. Kravis added, ''Ellie and I went on our hands and knees to our tradespeople'' to entreat them to deliver finished upholstery in time.

In the first week of January, Mrs. Kravis recalled, they walked around the house and grounds, donning sunglasses and sun hats and pretending it was summer. ''We imagined the landscaping and the not-yet-built tennis court,'' she said, ''and thought what it might be like to walk through the house and out to play tennis.''

Soon the budget had to be increased. ''The first budget was with the idea of furnishing the house with pine furniture,'' Mrs. Kravis recalled. ''But the house was so serious and the scale of the architecture so enormous, we knew that would never do.''

Monogrammed and embroidered linens were ordered, too: bed, bath, table, pool and cocktail linens.

The Pantzers had to decide quickly on fabrics and furnishings. ''Everything we showed them had to be in stock,'' Mrs. Kravis said.
