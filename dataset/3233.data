The challenge put to The Times's critics was direct: Name a 20th-century work considered ''timeless'' today that you think will be all but forgotten in 100 years. Their selections:

'THE NUTCRACKER,' A TIRED GIMMICK

Visions of sugarplum fairies will continue to dance in our heads through Tchaikovsky's glorious score for ''The Nutcracker.'' The music will endure, but as a ballet, ''The Nutcracker'' is approaching self-destruction.

Although the first staging dates from 1892, the ''Nutcracker'' craze began with George Balanchine's 1954 production for the New York City Ballet. A shrewd mix of spectacle and romantic plot (a child's dream journey into a candy kingdom) has been turned by dance troupes throughout the land into a box-office gimmick.

The truth is that ''The Nutcracker,'' slim on classical dancing, is not the ideal introduction to ballet. Hence the urge to tinker and the spate of revisionist versions: Drosselmeier, the little heroine's godfather, is now likely to be a child molester. At some point, we will prefer an ice show from that other magic kingdom. ANNA KISSELGOFF
