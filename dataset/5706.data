To the Editor:

Your news article ''20-Year Low in City Fires Posted in '84'' (March 2) quoted a number of theories regarding the dramatic downturn in fire activity, including the commonly heard ''There is nothing left to burn.'' I for one consider such a cynical hypothesis to be singularly uninformed.

To suggest that arson merely burned itself out overlooks the city's coordinated antiarson efforts, which have, since the formation of the Arson Strike Force by the Mayor and City Council in 1978, reduced incendiary fires in vacant structures to the lowest level in more than 27 years.

Two major programs in controlling arson in vacant buildings are particularly important. The Fire Department's Red Cap Program, established in 1981, keeps vandals out of vacant buildings through saturated patrol strategies. The Seal Up and Demolition Program of Housing Preservation and Development is responsible for demolishing over 12,000 empty buildings and sealing 31,000 more buildings (8,000 masonary and 23,000 tin) in the last seven years, virtually removing the opportunity for vandals to set fires in such arson-prone structures.

Thus, the ''nothing left to burn'' theory, like most simplistic answers offered in response to complex problems, has one fatal flaw: it is simply not true.
