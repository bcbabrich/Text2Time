Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, issued another appeal today to the Chinese government to reopen negotiations with his government. But Mr. Chen's overture -- the latest of several since he was elected in March -- was all but lost in the face of his deepening political troubles at home and evidence of mounting impatience in Beijing.

''If there is dialogue, there can be exchanges,'' Mr. Chen said at a news conference in Taipei. ''If there are exchanges, there can be a consensus.''

Despite the conciliatory words, Mr. Chen brushed aside Beijing's demand that Taiwan acknowledge a single China, of which it is a part. Instead, he asked China to embrace ''the spirit of 1992'' -- a reference to negotiations in which the two sides agreed to disagree about the meaning of ''one China.''

Experts say Mr. Chen's flexibility on relations with China was constrained last month when his party reaffirmed its support of an independent Taiwan.
