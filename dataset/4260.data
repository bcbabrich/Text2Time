Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the inauguration of Rudolph W. Giuliani misstated his margin of victory over David N. Dinkins in the mayoral election. The margin was 53,340 votes, not "fewer than 50,000 votes."

A chart listing inaugural events misstated the time of a party tomorrow at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. It begins about 1 P.M., not at 1 A.M.
