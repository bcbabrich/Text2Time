The bulletin out of Beth Israel Medical Center yesterday morning was intriguingly incomplete. ''At least'' five sets of twins, the notice read, had been born there in the last 24 hours. The wording raised two possibilities: either doctors there had no idea exactly what was going on, or a statistically improbable occurrence was becoming even more so.

In fact, set No. 6 was on its way by early afternoon, when a small army of doctors, nurses and public relations people greeted reporters with the vitals: more twins than had ever been born in so short a time at the hospital had blinked their wrinkled way into the world, starting at 7:40 A.M. Thursday. Half were the result of fertility treatments. Four of the 12 parents were lawyers. One father was a mailman. (''So both he and his wife deliver -- hah, hah, hah!'' one of the public relations people said.)

The numbers went on: by noon, two of the women had delivered naturally, two had delivered by Caesarean section and one had had what an obstetrician, Dr. Janet Stein, called ''the complete obstetrical experience'' -- a natural birth and a Caesarean birth.

''And the last set,'' Dr. Stein said, ''we hope she'll push them out any moment now.''

Most important, everybody was fine, and the babies were beautiful.
