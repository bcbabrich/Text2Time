A new musical based on “Southern Comfort,” Kate Davis’s award-winning documentary about transgender friends in rural Georgia will be presented by CAP21 Theater Company in Manhattan this fall.

The musical, also called “Southern Comfort,” features a folk-bluegrass score by Dan Collins (book and lyrics) and Julianne Wick Davis (music). The show, to be presented at CAP21’s Black Box Theater on West 18th Street, will star Annette O’Toole (“The Kennedys of Massachusetts,” “Smallville”) and Jeff McCarthy (“Urinetown,” “Beauty and the Beast”). Tom Caruso directs. Previews are to begin Oct. 5.
