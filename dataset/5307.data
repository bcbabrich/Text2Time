To the Editor:

''Know-Nothings on the Waterfront'' (editorial, June 25) castigates those who want to create a public esplanade on the Hudson River waterfront. Your wrongheaded and uninformed recommendations would result in a continuation of the Battery Park landfill up the Hudson River to 42d Street. It would, in practice, fill the river with concrete and high-rise buildings. The beneficiaries would be real estate developers, builders and the people who could afford to live there. The rest of us would be cut off from the river as in the last century, when the four-mile stretch of shoreline along the Hudson River was largely inaccessible to New Yorkers.

It is now little more than a wasteland. But with proper planning, it could be a verdant, riverfront promenade and bicycle path that would link recreational piers, community and cultural centers, restaurants, marinas, shaded sitting areas, sculpture-filled plazas, terraced lawns and perhaps even a small amusement park.

Instead of characterizing the proposers of these beneficial suggestions as ''obstructive,'' ''absurd'' and ''obsessive,'' you should think more carefully about the long-term harmful effects of unrestricted landfill and platforming in the Hudson River.

Have you looked lately at the underdeveloped West Side of Manhattan between 8th and 12th Avenues below the convention center? How can you propose building in the river when such great development possibilities exist on the land? Your smug editorial is indifferent to alternative human-scale development on the waterfront.
