Q. Why does inhaling helium make your voice sound funny? A.Resonance, the reinforcement and prolongation of sound, depends in part on the space in which the sound is propagated and what that space contains. According to Jearl Walker, chairman of the physics department at Cleveland State University and author of ''The Circus of Physics,'' the resonance of your mouth and throat depends on the speed of sound in the gas they contain. Because sound travels faster in helium than in air, your voice has a higher pitch when you have inhaled helium.

But take heed: inhaling helium can cause suffocation. Q.Have photographs made from satellites forced cartographers to change any maps? A.Photos and other information from space have resulted in many map changes, especially involving underwater features such as reefs, according to Alden Colvocoresses, a mapmaker for the United States Geological Survey. Some of these features were found to be as much as 15 miles out of place, he said.

Mr. Colvocoresses, who is president-elect of the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, said scientists studying satellite photos were surprised to discover a small island, previously unknown, off the east coast of Canada. They named it Landsat Island, he said, after the satellite that spotted it.
