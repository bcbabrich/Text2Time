John Harry Niemeyer, president emeritus of the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan, died on April 19 in the Florida Keys. He was 95 and had moved there from Greenwich Village four years ago.

His death was announced by his family.

During his presidency, from 1956 to 1973, Bank Street became a national model for education in an urban setting.

Under Mr. Niemeyer's auspices, the college and Macmillan Publishers produced the Bank Street Readers, introduced in 1965, which were designed to appeal to urban children of mixed social and ethnic backgrounds with stories about youngsters like themselves.

It was the first set of reading primers to leave behind the small-town white cast of the Dick and Jane. The Bank Street Readers, for children through Grade 3, showed metropolitan skylines, city streets with cars and traffic lights and laundry strung out on fire escapes.
