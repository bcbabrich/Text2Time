Lucent Technologies said yesterday that it was seeking to raise $1 billion through a private sale of securities in a deal that could provide a cushion for the company's creditors.

Lucent, the maker of communications equipment, said proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock would be used for general corporate purposes. The company is under pressure to come up with cash, even though it has recently reached agreements to sell assets for more than $3.3 billion.

''This sale of securities will strengthen our liquidity,'' said Michelle Davidson, a spokeswoman for Lucent, which is based in Murray Hill, N.J.

Lucent said last week that it planned to take a charge against earnings of as much as $9 billion this quarter to cover investment losses and job cuts. In addition, Lucent said it would delay by six months the planned spinoff of a chip-making operation, Agere Systems, that had been planned for September. Lucent could end up on shaky footing with creditors as a result of the charge.
