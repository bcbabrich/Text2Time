He and my mother separated the following summer after 28 years of marriage. That was 2003. I chose my mom. I didn’t have to take sides, but I did. I flooded his email with hateful letters, blaming him for everything wrong in my life. “You were a terrible father,” I wrote. “I will never forgive you. I won’t go to your funeral.”

Things only got worse when he remarried and developed a close relationship with his stepchildren. For them it seemed he couldn’t do enough. I spent hours staring at pictures on Facebook. The proud dad at graduation. The proud father of the bride. I wondered what made them better than me. I concluded that the difference was, he didn’t have to raise them. They were grown-ups. He could drink beers with them. But I believe he loved them very much.

My anger began to lessen when I got married in 2014. I once read that a good relationship can heal old emotional wounds, and for me that proved true. We began to text and there were even occasional visits — like that time we met for lentil soup — but things were never great. I never met his family. During his murder investigation, I was interviewed as a person of interest.

On Thanksgiving, his last one on earth, he sent me a message asking if I wanted to talk. “If so, I’ll call,” he wrote. I never replied. Another read: “Have so much I want to talk about. Maybe one day if you are ready.” I ignored that too. I didn’t feel like dealing with it; there was just too much to unpack. Another day.

People have asked me, “Was it harder when you thought he was murdered?” And my answer is no. The suicide is harder. It is so much harder. I thought he died in his prime, a happy guy on his way to meet a friend for a coffee. And my dad knew that. He knew a homicide would be easier for us. He knew we would blame ourselves for missing the signs. He knew I would blame myself, the estranged daughter who had not called him on his birthday in 15 years, who told him she was getting married but then said, “It’s best that you don’t come.”

My father was tormented by something. By what, we don’t know. Detectives were unable to find a motive. But he spent nine years obsessively searching for ways to end his life.

My dad told us so much about himself in his method. He tried to protect us all. That is how he said goodbye.
