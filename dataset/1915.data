Senator Barack Obama has will.i.am (and, wanted or not, Ludacris). Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton had Merle Haggard. Even Representative Ron Paul has this girl. Now, Senator John McCain has his own theme song by a music star.

“Raising McCain,” which focuses on the presumptive Republican nominee’s years in a North Vietnamese prison camp, will be performed tonight by its composer, John Rich, half of the country duo Big & Rich, tonight at the Country First Concert in Panama City Beach, Fla. (Mr. McCain plans to “stop by.”)

“He stayed strong, stayed extra long ‘til they let all the other boys out. Now we’ve got a real man with an American plan, we’re going to put him in the big White House,” are the lyrics to a verse, according to The Associated Press. The refrain is, “We’re all just raising McCain.”

If you don’t catch it tonight, we’re sure it’ll be on the candidate’s daughter Meghan’s next country play list. Apparently, Mr. Rich knew she was the music fan in the family – he passed it to her first, and she brought it to the campaign.
