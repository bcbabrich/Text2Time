Hours after Mike Richter made 26 saves in the Rangers' 3-0 victory over the Boston Bruins last night at Madison Square Garden, Dan Blackburn, the 18-year-old who could open the season as Richter's backup, agreed to a three-year deal.

The contract, which is likely to be worth the rookie salary cap of $3.525 million, ensures that Blackburn will not have to be sent back to his junior team, the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League. Had Blackburn not come to terms before 3 p.m. today, he would have been returned to Kootenay. He was the Rangers' first selection, 10th over all, in this summer's entry draft.

''The Rangers told him he had a job here as long as he played well,'' said Mark Hall, Blackburn's agent, who reached agreement on the contract with Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager.

If Blackburn appears in at least 10 N.H.L. games in which he plays 31 or more minutes this season, he will lose a year's exemption from the waiver draft. And if the Rangers send Blackburn back to Kootenay, they cannot recall him unless there is an emergency or until his junior season is over.
