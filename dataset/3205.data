President Bush announced late yesterday that he would nominate James B. Comey as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. If confirmed, he would succeed Mary Jo White, a Clinton appointee who served almost nine years, building a strong record in prosecuting international terrorism.

Mr. Comey, 40, has spent the last five years as a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va., but if he comes to New York, he will be joining the office in which he began his career as a prosecutor from 1987 to 1993.

Last night, Mr. Comey said, ''I'm honored to be named, and I'm excited about getting back to New York.'' He declined to comment further.

Mr. Comey, who was born in Yonkers, has been in charge of the Richmond division of the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia. In Richmond, he established a widely acclaimed program, Project Exile, to aggressively prosecute felons with guns, which has cut the homicide rate significantly and removed guns from the street.
