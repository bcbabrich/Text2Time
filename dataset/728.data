WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today’s puzzle by Alan Arbesfeld takes two-word terms having to do with outer space and clues them in a punny way so as to give them completely different meanings.

I’ve made many puzzles like this, and a key to having this type of theme really soar is to make sure that the entries are really well-known phrases, or the puns tend to fall flat. You might have been instantly familiar with all of them; I had difficulty recognizing RADIATION BELT and POLE STAR, even though I know what they are. It was easy enough to get LIGHT YEAR for the clue “Easy two semesters at school?” and RED GIANT for “Lenin, say?”, even though I felt it was a stretch to clue the entry to Lenin. Same for cluing POLE STAR as “Lech Walesa, for one.” I liked “Fabulous deli delicacy?” for SUPER NOVA, because mmmm, NOVA, and it’s much closer to being a fabulous deli delicacy than Lech Walesa is to being a Polish star.

In nontheme news, we have some nice entries, like MR. HYDE, I’M GLAD, JUICE BAR, SPARE RIB, HARPO, INDIA INK and TAX HAVEN. I’m not partial to partials, so opening the puzzle with A JAM and having another one at 19 Across (A HIGH) seemed a bit much. I might have torn them out and tried to see if I could have come up with more lively fill.

Let’s move on to the Thursday puzzle with this funky POLE STAR from Earth, Wind & Fire:
