Mr. Weill seems to have done a good job at Commercial Credit, getting out of a variety of businesses, including lending to companies, to concentrate on the lucrative business of making second-mortgage and personal loans to consumers around America. Profits rose sharply in the first year he ran Commercial Credit and have risen steadily since.

Mr. Liss of Salomon puts the pretax profit margins there at 26 percent last year, meaning that for each $4 in revenues, the company manages to earn $1 before taxes. But Wall Street has not been eager to pay much for those profits, in part because of worries that in a recession many loans could default.

In 1988, Mr. Weill made his way back to Wall Street with a deal to take over the old Primerica Corporation. That company was the former American Can Corporation and was being run by Gerald Tsai, a star money manager in the late-1960's bull market whose reputation took a tumble along with stock prices as that decade ended.

Can Operations Sold

Making his comeback, Mr. Tsai redirected Primerica into financial services, selling the can operations at prices well below what they would have fetched a few years later, while paying high prices for financial services operations. He capped that buying spree shortly before the crash by paying $750 million for Smith Barney a few months before the crash. Having overpaid, Primerica needed a buyer.

After Commercial Credit took over Primerica in a $1.5 billion deal, mostly for Commercial Credit stock, the surviving firm was renamed Primerica, helping to confuse many an investor. While that deal may prove to have been a good one in the long term, it has done nothing for the stock price so far, in part because the new company pays a small dividend of just 32 cents a share a year. The old Primerica had paid high dividends, and many of those holders have been selling.

Cash had been pouring out of Primerica before the takeover, but that has turned around. While insurance operations remain the most important part of the company, Smith Barney's results have improved to show a record profit last year of $63 million, before writing off $13 million in ''good will'' stemming from its acquisition. In a move typical of Mr. Weill, the brokerage swooped down and acquired a part of Drexel Burnham Lambert's retail network last year at almost no cost.

All told, the new Primerica reported 1989 profits of $289 million, or $2.87 a share. But the shares, even after rising 25 cents, to $26.875, yesterday, are trading at less than 10 times last year's profits, and just eight times estimates of this year's earnings. Those are not impressive figures, and reflect the general disrepute in which financial services companies are now held.

But Mr. Weill, while he may be a man of Wall Street, has never been especially enamored of its collective wisdom. He built his first empire by making cheap takeovers of brokerage firms when others feared to do so. He wisely stayed out when prices were soaring in 1987, only to get back in at much cheaper prices in 1988. Whatever comes of the talks, the fact that he is interested in Shearson now may indicate that in the wake of Drexel's collapse and layoffs around the Street, he thinks Wall Street is undervaluing itself.
