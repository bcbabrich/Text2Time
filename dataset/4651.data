Investigators said the pilot did not tell the control tower of his decision to abort immediately; he just did it, veering left near the end of the runway to avoid a blast fence and halting the plane in a grassy area 100 feet off the runway. The nose gear collapsed, but the landing gear under the wings remained in place, officials said.

Safety experts and experienced pilots, without knowing details of the pilot's account, said he had clearly made the right decision, given the outcome.

Gregory A. Feith, a deputy regional director of the safety board and a member of its investigating team, said it was "too early to make a statement on why the pilot aborted the takeoff," but he said the crew had accomplished a difficult task by evacuating all 292 people from four front exits in the burning plane in less than two minutes.

Most of the injuries -- cuts, bruises, a few broken bones and other traumas -- were sustained in the slide down escape chutes, where a swarm of police, fire, medical and other emergency vehicles were on the scene within minutes, providing assistance in what experts called a textbook example of proper safety procedures.

Passengers, many of them apparently unaware of the fire or at least of its seriousness, moved swiftly and with a minimum of panic, witnesses said, and it was not until five or 10 minutes later -- as they watched their plane burn from a distance -- that many lost control of their emotions.

Many passengers offered high praise for the pilots and crew and resumed their journey to the coast. Some also told of a terrible hardship made even worse by difficulties encountered in motels and hotels where they were put up for the night.

Julia Elhauge, 31, a California writer who had lost the copies of her first novel in the fire, said T.W.A. had failed to provide many passengers with vouchers for hotels and meals. "Without a voucher from T.W.A., they refused to serve us. They were turning hundreds of people out into the street." Chronology of Flight 843 The Race to Help

The Kennedy control tower notifies the Port Authority police dispatcher, Officer Philip Monturi, that a plane is down. The airport is immediately closed to air traffic. 5:41.58 Officer Monturi dispatches fire and other emergency equipment to Runway 13-right, where the plane has come to rest. 5:42.20 Officer Paul Brigandi of the Port Authority police reaches the L-1011 and reports to the dispatcher that the plane is on fire. 5:45 Five firetrucks have arrived at the site of the fire. 5:47 Pilot tells rescue workers he thinks all passengers are out of plane. 6:23 First reports of injuries are made to the dispatcher. 6:35 Officer Brigandi is taken to Mary Immaculate City Hospital, where he is treated for smoke inhalation. 6:50 Emergency Medical Service reports to the dispatcher that it has treated 15 injuries. 7:05 Mayor David N. Dinkins arrives at the airport. 7:16 The number of injured people rises to 22, including two Port Authority police officers. 7:29 The dispatcher is told that 291 people were on board the plane and have been accounted for.
