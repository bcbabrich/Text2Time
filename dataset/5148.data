Mr. Williams said no decision had been made on whether the American military personnel would act as tactical advisers to the Colombians or, if so, whether they would accompany Colombian forces on anti-narcotics operations. Americans initially went to Vietnam as trainers in the 1950's, then moved into an advisory role in the 1960's before combat forces were deployed there.

Even though no decision has been made, military officers said they were preparing to select and train advisers if the President orders them sent. While officers and noncommissioned officers might be proficient in their own specialties, they would need training on how to advise Colombians.

All American military personnel in Colombia will operate under normal rules of engagement, Mr. Williams said, which means they will have the right to fire to defend themselves and to use reasonable force to protect their equipment and munitions. 'Potential Dangers Down There'

Colombia is experiencing a campaign of bombing and violence by the drug traffickers, a situation that could place American military personnel at risk. ''They have to know that there are potential dangers down there,'' an Administration official said.

In the Pentagon, however, officials said they had not yet received guidance from the White House on the policy of responding to an attack, beyond the rules of engagement.
