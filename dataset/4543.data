In the next two weeks, the presidents of the City University's 17 undergraduate colleges are to deliver to Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds their plans for eliminating or consolidating some programs and expanding others. The goal, the Chancellor says, is to save millions of dollars and insure CUNY's survival as the nation's largest urban university in a time of economic hardship.

But accomplishing those changes depends in part on the fragile relationship between Ms. Reynolds and the faculty of these institutions. Since she announced her proposal to streamline the system last December, she has faced a barrage of criticism from restive faculty members who view her as high-handed and abusive. She, in turn, appears to regard the faculty as jealously territorial and stubborn.

Her recommendation to dismiss the president of the College of Staten Island, which the system's 17-member Board of Trustees supported on Monday, brought those tensions to the forefront. The dismissed college president, Edmond L. Volpe, has been a vocal opponent of the Chancellor's plans. On Friday, Karen Kaplowitz, chairman of the Faculty Senate of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, spoke of the possibility of "civil war at the university."

Since the fall term began, faculty groups at CUNY's various campuses have churned out a blizzard of resolutions alternately challenging, condemning and sometimes grudgingly accepting the Chancellor's efforts to streamline the curriculum.
