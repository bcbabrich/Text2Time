Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the House Democratic majority leader from Maryland, called in a speech on Monday for both parties to set aside their deep differences and compromise on a package of future tax increases and reduced spending on benefit programs to avert fiscal calamity.

To illustrate the balancing act required, Mr. Hoyer not only argued that tax revenues would have to increase in coming years despite Republicans’ opposition, but he also challenged the sacred cows in his own party by suggesting several options for reducing the growth of spending on Medicare and Social Security that Democrats resist.

Among the options, he cited proposals to increase the retirement age for Social Security to reflect Americans’ longer life spans, an idea that would mean big savings over time but is detested by unions and other groups who argue it would disadvantage people in physically demanding jobs. Mr. Hoyer described other options for means-testing of Medicare and Social Security, like reducing benefits or raising premiums for high-income beneficiaries.

“A balanced approach would spread the effects of change across American society, rather than concentrating them on seniors,” he said.

In his address at the Brookings Institution, a policy research organization, Mr. Hoyer combined an apocalyptic vision of the nation’s fiscal future if Washington does not act, based on longstanding but worsened budget projections, with an admittedly idealistic view of the political parties’ willingness to come together behind difficult solutions, which few in Washington share.

The present time, he said, “is our turning point and our choice — the point at which we join the debt-ridden powers who saw the story of their greatness end in fiscal ruin, or the point at which we as a nation refuse that ending and write a new chapter.”

Within the House Democratic leadership, Mr. Hoyer is the voice for the fiscally conservative members known as Blue Dogs. His speech, however, was an effort to boost the less-than-favorable prospects of a bipartisan commission that President Obama has established to propose ways by Dec. 1 to reduce annual deficits.

While Mr. Hoyer reiterated the Democratic leadership’s promise that Congress would vote in December on whatever recommendations the fiscal commission might agree to, his purpose on Monday was to lay a foundation for the emerging commission’s work, by describing the tough steps that many economists agree are needed to reduce the mounting debt.

Economists for decades have projected that the debt would reach unsustainable heights early in the 21st century as the aging of the large baby-boomer generation and fast-rising health care costs drove up the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. But the costs of the deep recession in lost revenues and higher safety-net spending have hastened the projected fiscal reckoning, economists say.

“It is a waste of time to hand out blame,” Mr. Hoyer said. Yet he admonished Republicans for rhetoric suggesting “our budget deficit snapped into existence at noon on Jan. 20, 2009”— when Mr. Obama was inaugurated — and for their record when they controlled the White House and Congress of cutting taxes, financing two wars and creating a Medicare drug benefit on borrowed money.

But Mr. Hoyer’s indictment of such “easy choices” also included Mr. Obama’s campaign promise not to raise taxes on 95 percent of Americans.

“Those kinds of easy choices are so often selfish choices,” he said, “because they leave the chore of cleaning up to someone else. Easy choices may be popular — but the popularity is bought on credit.”

Mr. Hoyer also called on the public “to educate itself” about the nation’s budgetary plight and “not to demand that government continue to escalate entitlement payments and lower the deficit at the same time.”
