A Government task force recommended yesterday that the Justice Department assess whether the Upjohn Company committed crimes by failing to report serious side effects caused by the sleeping pill Halcion.

Despite the recommendation, the task force advised in its report that Halcion could stay on the market because the drug appeared to be safe as long as its users follow label instructions and are aware of possible side-effects. It added that because of unresolved questions about the drug, further assessment of Halcion's safety and efficacy might be needed.

The task force, a committee of outside experts, was set up by the Food and Drug Administration in 1994 to investigate possible misconduct by Upjohn in its dealings with the Government over the the sleeping pill.

F.D.A. officials were quick to point out that the task force had not made a criminal referral, in which a Federal agency turns over information indicating crimes had been committed and requests an investigation. Rather, the task force was simply suggesting that Federal prosecutors determine for themselves if such an investigation was needed.
