Ever so quietly, senior officials of the International Olympic Committee are still working on resolving the issue of North Korea's participation in the Seoul Olympics later this year.

At a recent state dinner in Madrid, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president, spoke privately with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, to review the I.O.C.'s position and to seek any help the Soviet Union might offer in persuading North Korea to attend the games.

In June, the I.O.C. offered the North Koreans five events to stage. Last month, Pyongyang responded by saying North Korea would not participate in the Games unless it was made a co-host with South Korea. North Korea thus became one of 6 of the 167 nations to respond negatively to the I.O.C.'s invitation to take part in the Summer Games.

A source familar with Samaranch's conversation with Shevardnadze said the Foreign Minister seemed surprised to hear that North Korea would not take the I.O.C. offer.
