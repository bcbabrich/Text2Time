The holding companies of the Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti narrowed their pretax losses in the first half of 1996 as increases in earnings from their investments in auto-parts companies offset losses at Olivetti S.p.A. Compagnie Industriali Riunuite S.p.A., or C.I.R., said its pretax loss narrowed to 18.9 billion lire ($12.6 million), from 151.5 billion lire a year earlier.

Cofide S.p.A., Mr. de Benedetti's family holding, said its first-half losses were cut to 9.5 billion lire, from 504.3 billion lire. The family controls 56 percent of Cofide, which controls 50.06 percent of C.I.R., which controls 49 percent of the French holding company Cerus. (Bloomberg Business News)
