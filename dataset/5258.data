On bad days I wear red. What's a bad day? It's one when words won't come; when the typewriter is glum and unproductive; when I've burned the prunes for the second time; when the crevices in my skin make me sad - again.

So I wear red - brilliant with life, a spirit-lifter. Also, it gives spring a giant prod. I don't demean winter; it has its scenic, brittle splendor, albeit with melancholy attributes. I don't gainsay that my neighbor's oak tree with outstretched branches doesn't have a bleak appeal, but what compares with the magenta, peach and blue crocuses, and those daring, darling daffodils, and a soft breeze like a blessing?

Suddenly the universe bursts into being. So it is with color - twin playmate to hope - even reflected in the new fashions: flamboyant dresses with riotous configurations on skirts, scarfs, footgear. Black has no status in this landscape; gray rates poorly.

In this atmosphere corns ache less, bones cease some of their grinding, eyes are alerted, jitters ease off and spirits soar. Red is a singing color, an antidote to winter's impudence. Something positive and gutsy in red is a fillip to ego and spirit.
