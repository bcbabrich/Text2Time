Help Wanted: Critic

When Pia Lindstrom first began working as a theater critic on television, she was so worried that she wouldn't look as if she knew what she was talking about that she would eavesdrop on other theatergoers during intermission. "I used to go into the lobby, lean over and listen," she said, cackling.

Eventually Ms. Lindstrom came to trust her instincts and became a graceful fixture on both WNBC-TV (Channel 4) and Broadway. But now, after 23 years with the New York station, she is leaving, though she is not sure what's next. "I do think you have to pass the baton on to somebody else," she said.

Will there be someone to grab it? The trend in television has been to downgrade theater coverage. Channels 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11 once consistently broadcast reviews on opening night. At present, only Channel 2, with Dennis Cunningham, does. (Channels 5, 7 and 9 have critics who review theater sporadically or on a freelance basis; 11 has no critic at all. New York City's cable Channel 1 also does reviews.) Terry Doll, a spokeswoman for WNBC, said, "We will continue to have theater and movie reviews, and the station is looking for someone to fill that role."

Changes in coverage reflect changes in habits, Ms. Lindstrom said: "Broadway theater is very much for tourists and people with $65. Our audience wants to take their kids to see 'Toy Story.' "
