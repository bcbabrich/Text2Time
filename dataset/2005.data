George Mason’s surprising run through the N.C.A.A. Tournament last season attracted much attention to mid-majors and to the Colonial Athletic Association. Plenty of people will be looking at the C.A.A. tournament in Richmond, Va., this weekend, wondering if this season’s George Mason will emerge. I don’t think so. And don’t expect more than two teams to come out of the conference this season.

Virginia Commonwealth , Old Dominion, Hofstra and Drexel are playing for the conference’s automatic bid and one at-large bid, making this one of the better mid-major conference tournaments. I’m also looking forward to the Mountain West Conference, the Missouri Valley Conference, the Patriot League and the Southern Conference tournaments.



In the C.A.A., Virginia Commonwealth won the regular-season title but there’s not much else there, despite the talents of its three guards, B.A.Walker, Eric Maynor and Jesse Pellot-Rosa. V.C.U. was 1-1 against Old Dominion, it beat Drexel and it lost to Hofstra. The Rams’ nonconference schedule was not that impressive; their best nonconference victory was at Albany (America East). Losing to Appalachian State (Southern Conference) and to Bradley (Missouri Valley) hurt. I’m a fan of rewarding the regular-season champ, but Virginia Commonwealth doesn’t excite me.

Led by their versatile forward Valdas Vasylius and point guard Drew Williamson, Old Dominion won its last 10 conference games to finish second. The Monarchs haven’t lost since Jan. 20 and take an 11-game winning streak into the conference tournament. Old Dominion swept Drexel, split with Hofstra and split with Virginia Commonwealth. The Monarchs’ most impressive victory was their 13-point upset of Georgetown (Big East), which was ranked eighth at the time, in November. I think that and the winning streak could be enough to negate losses to Marist (Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference), Virginia Tech (Atlantic Coast Conference) and Winthrop (Big South).

Hofstra, led by its three talented guards, Loren Stokes, Antoine Agudio and Carlos Rivera, finished third in the conference. The Pride opened 0-3 but I’ll blame that on the after-affects of last season, when the Pride beat George Mason twice in the final two weeks, finished second in the conference tourney and still lost an N.C.A.A. bid to the Patriots. The Pride defeated Virginia Commonwealth, split with Old Dominion and split with Drexel. Outside of the conference, Hofstra lost to Syracuse (Big East) but beat St. John’s (Big East) and Holy Cross (Patriot League). Still, the three guards, defense (18-0 when holding teams below 70) and experience (11-4 in games decided by 5 points or less after losing its first two) are difficult to overlook.

Drexel has relied on the 6-foot-9 center Frank Elegar and guards Dominic Mejia, and Bashir Mason. The Dragons were inconsistent all season and finished fourth in the conference in the regular season. They were 0-1 against Virginia Commonwealth, were swept by Old Dominion, and split with Hofstra. They have 13 road victories, a strong, strong number. They lost by 19 at Penn (which is across the street from the Drexel campus in Philadelphia) and by 8 at Rider. They won at Vermont, at Villanova, at Syracuse and at Creighton. I can’t see the Dragons, a fourth-place team with an 8-point loss to Rider and a 19-point loss to Penn, earning an at-large bid unless they reach the conference title game.

If the tournament plays out according to seedings, V.C.U. will beat Drexel and O.D.U. will beat Hofstra in the semifinals.
