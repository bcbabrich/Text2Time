Mitchell D. Schweitzer, who retired in 1972 as a New York State Supreme Court Justice after more than 26 years on various benches in New York City courts, died on Monday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. A former resident of Manhattan, Judge Schweitzer was 86 years old and lived in Wayside, N.J.

His death was caused by congestive heart failure, his family said.

Judge Schweitzer made his reputation with a keen legal mind leavened by a sense of humor. He also was known as one of the hardest working judges in New York, setting records for the swift disposition of cases. Probe Into Fitness

He abruptly left the bench in January 1972 to halt a judicial inquiry into his fitness to preside at court. That investigation began after Federal and state official had started looking into his friendship with Nathan Voloshen, an accused swindler who pleaded guilty in 1970 to charges of conspiracy to defraud Federal agencies. Judge Schweitzer denied each allegation and none of them was proven. Earlier, in 1959, Judge Schweitzer was publicly criticized in some of the news media for refusing to make public a grand jury presentment regarding rigged television-quiz shows, a subject rife with publicity.

"I've been called a thief and a crook and those things are never pleasant," he said in defending himself at the time. "But my first duty is to the law and to my conscience. I can be guided only by what the law tells me.
