Yankee General Manager Bob Watson wants to sign Bernie Williams to a three- or four-year contract, but not a two-year deal. Manager Joe Torre wants to finish his career with the Yankees. Rebecca Maher simply wants Derek Jeter's autograph.

As unbelievable as it might seem, Torre could have the best chance at getting what he wants.

Those snippets were only some of the sights and sounds yesterday from the always stunning devotional to the Yankees called the Fan Festival. Since the Yankees are the defending World Series champions, the 4,100 fans who crammed into the New York Coliseum were more excitable than usual. They wanted the Yankees and they wanted them immediately.

As Watson and Torre discussed the difficulty of repeating, some of the luster of the annual event dissipated as fans realized the only starters signing autographs were Jeter, Joe Girardi and Paul O'Neill. Jeter's line closed early because of overwhelming demand, and Girardi left some fans steamed after he bolted about an hour earlier than he was scheduled to leave.

''They should have realized after winning a World Series that thousands of fans would be here,'' said Maher, who is from Wappingers Falls, N.Y. ''I came last year and had a blast. This year, I couldn't even get on Jeter's line. I won't be coming back.''
