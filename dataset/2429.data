WASHINGTON, June 30 - The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Thursday, the ninth consecutive increase and almost certainly not the last.

As investors expected, the central bank raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks a quarter-point, to 3.25 percent.

In a statement that accompanied the announcement, policy makers gave no hint of when they might slow or stop their march to higher rates.

They repeated previous declarations that monetary policy is "accommodative," which means interest rates are still lower than officials want, and they again said rates could still rise at a "measured" pace.
