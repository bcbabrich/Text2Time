A man was stabbed and beaten to death in Park Slope, Brooklyn, early Sunday morning, according to the police and relatives of the man.

The man, Alex Santiago, 22, was with a group of friends at a bodega when a fight broke out with another group of men, said Mr. Santiago’s cousin, Jose Arroyo.

After a brief scuffle, the other group left the bodega and returned about 10 minutes later, shortly after midnight, in a black car to attack Mr. Santiago and his friends, who were on the sidewalk on 12th Street near Fifth Avenue, not far from the store, Mr. Arroyo said.

One of the men hit Mr. Santiago in the head with a crowbar, Mr. Arroyo said. He was then stabbed three times.

Mr. Santiago was taken to New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, where he was pronounced dead. Another man who was stabbed during the fight was taken to Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, and was in stable condition, the police said.

Amid barely visible splotches of blood, friends left roses, a poster with remembrances and an empty bottle of Bacardi — the last drink Mr. Santiago had, a friend said — near the area on 12th Street where the killing occurred.

Mr. Santiago’s wife was eight months pregnant with their son, Mr. Arroyo said. A baby shower was planned for Saturday.

Mr. Santiago grew up in Park Slope, but his family moved to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, in 2002, and he was recently laid off from a job at Yeshiva University, relatives said.

“He was a good brother, a good son — he was a gentleman, always respectful of his elders,” Mr. Arroyo said.

“He didn’t deserve this,” said another cousin, Jessica Vega.
