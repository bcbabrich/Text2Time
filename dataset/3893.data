To the Editor:

In your Sept. 27 editorial on single-sex schools, you state that the Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem ''provides the kind of warm learning environment and personalized attention that would benefit any student, girl or boy.'' However, the girls' academy provides a conducive learning environment to girls precisely because many girls learn better in the absence of boys, whose aggressiveness is often intimidating and demoralizing to female students.

On the other hand, society is ill served by the establishment of all-boys schools because males already are in a position of dominance. Girls should be permitted to develop their intellectual abilities in a setting conducive to engendering a certain level of confidence before they enter universities, where they will then be able to compete on more equal terms with males.
