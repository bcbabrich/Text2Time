Preachers, politicians, creditors and divorce lawyers have spent the last few weeks jabbing more at Mike Tyson than Danny Williams, who knocked out Tyson in the fourth round Friday night. All have decried Tyson's bankruptcies, both financial and personal. And, for many critics, Tyson's need to stage several multimillion-dollar fights just to pay his creditors signifies boxing's overall decline.

But the short-story writer and former boxer Thom Jones, author of ''Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine,'' says he thinks that Tyson craves his return to the ring for more than financial reasons, and that the sport of boxing will meet the bell despite its current struggles.

''Mike is basically a showman, a smart guy, and a lot smarter than most people think,'' Jones said. ''His crimes are no worse than many football and basketball players'. The ring for him now is a refuge from all the people who want a piece of him. His real mistake has been believing what his entourage has told him. Don King took a dollar for every 50 cents he gave Mike.

''Don King is the symbol of what is wrong with boxing, not Mike Tyson. Without King, Mike Tyson might have led the renaissance of boxing like we thought he would when he first won the crown.''
