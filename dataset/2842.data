A parliamentarian, Martin Hohmann of the conservative Christian Democrats, has refused to apologize for saying that Jews could be described as a ''race of perpetrators'' for their role in the Russian Revolution. In an Oct. 3 speech in Neuhof, his hometown, Mr. Hohmann compared the killings in Russia's violent 1917 revolution, which he said were orchestrated by Jewish Bolsheviks, with the murder of Europe's Jews during the Holocaust. Jewish leaders and members of all Germany's political parties have condemned the remarks, and deputies from Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der's Social Democrats have called for Mr. Hohmann's dismissal from Parliament.
