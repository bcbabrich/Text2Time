In formally announcing their merger yesterday, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover said the savings from their combination would be greater than previously estimated.

Although the companies are now legally combined, the merger of their subsidiary banks will not be completed until the middle of the year, and customers must still pay different prices and use different branches.

Savings from the merger -- resulting from the elimination of 6,200 jobs through attrition and layoffs, the closing of about 70 duplicated branches and the combining of computer systems -- are now expected to total $750 million a year by 1995, up from $650 million estimated earlier by the Chemical Banking Corporation.

As estimated savings have increased, so have the costs of the merger. Chemical now expects the cost of severance payments, unneeded leases on closed branches and other costs will now total about $625 million, up from $550 million previously estimated. Those one-time expenses will be included in the fourth-quarter earnings of the new Chemical, to be reported later this month.
