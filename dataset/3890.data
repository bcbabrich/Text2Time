Montgomery County officials said Mr. Sheinbein could return voluntarily to the United States, but Ms. Leitner said her client might not be free to do so.

Ms. Leitner also said Israeli investigators did not ''know what they're investigating, so their questions ''are all over the place.'' She said the United States would be a better venue for her client because he could have his case decided by a jury instead of by a judge.

Robert Dean, the Montgomery County state's attorney, said today that Mr. Sheinbein would face a maximum life sentence in both Israel and Montgomery County. But, he said, in Isreal a life sentence can be served in 25 years, while in Maryland he could be sentenced to life without parole. Mr. Sheinbein would not be subject to Maryland's death penalty because he is a minor.

Mr. Dean said that while he was upset by Israel's decision he felt he had no choice but to proceed with plans to cooperate with Israeli prosecutors. The Montgomery County police said they planned to send two investigators there within the week.

Experts in international law said the case was highly unusual but not unheard of, since, unlike the United States, a number of countries do not extradite their citizens.

On the day Mr. Tello's body was found, real estate agents who were supervising repairs at a house recently put on the market in Aspen Hill stopped by, noticed a stench and found the head and torso wrapped in garbage bags. The police said that near the body they found an electric saw apparently used to dismember Mr. Tello's body. A trail of blood was found along a wooded path leads from Mr. Sheinbein's home to the where the body was found, they said.

Investigators said Mr. Sheinbein got into the house after calling the owner's son on a cellular phone to say he ''needed a place to take a girl'' and was told how to find a key.
