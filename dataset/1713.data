In one of the oddest displays yet of the global reach that Michael Jackson possessed, residents of the Ukrainian village of Oktyabrskoye are seeking to rename it after the singer, Agence France-Presse reported. Oleg Kislitsyn, a member of the regional parliament, said residents of the village, located in the Zaporizhia region in southeast Ukraine, had approached him with a proposal to change the name of the village to Jackson. “There are many fans of Michael Jackson there,” Mr. Kislitsyn said. He said that villagers wanted to create a Jackson museum in hopes of attracting tourists and that he supported the proposal to change the name. “I am not a fan but I respect his work,” Mr. Kislitsyn said. “He had an iron-clad will for victory.” The village’s municipal council is to consider the plan in August.
