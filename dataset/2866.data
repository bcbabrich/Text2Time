Romano Prodi, now president of the European Commission, was prime minister when Italy was struggling to win acceptance into the euro club. He remembers how Italian interest rates were two and three times the German rates. He remembers how top German officials initially treated Italy's ambitions as almost laughable.

But Italy did make it into the club. It cut its deficit, stabilized its exchange rate and brought down its inflation to German levels. As investors became more confident in Italy, interest rates on Italian bonds dropped to some of the lowest levels in history. That reduced Italy's huge interest rate payments and helped bring down the deficit even more.

''For me, as an Italian, the euro is pure joy,'' Mr. Prodi said in an interview.

It is easy to forget, and even many Europeans do, that the euro has existed since Jan. 1, 1999. That was when Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Finland and the Netherlands officially locked their national currencies together and created the euro as a new combined currency. Greece joined the group two years later. Britain, Denmark and Sweden have stayed out.

To be sure, the euro has been a disappointment to those who expected it to challenge the dominance of the dollar. In the three years leading up to the introduction of euro notes and coins, the euro has not eroded the dollar's position as an international reserve currency. It has not brought Europe's economic growth up to that of the United States.

And even now, when the American economy is in recession, the euro has not become a safe haven for international investors. The dollar still accounts for 68 percent of the reserve currencies held by governments around the world, while the euro accounts for only 13 percent.

The shaky confidence of investors about Europe is etched clearly on the value of the euro: still down about one-fifth against the dollar since 1999, the euro is worth about 90 cents.

Another example of the euro's impact is in changing the ground rules for doing business, including the way companies raise money.
