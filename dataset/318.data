When the United States was awarded the rights to the 1994 World Cup, the decision was greeted with similar howls by some soccer purists outside North America. There were even rumors FIFA could change its mind.

But on Nov. 19, 1989, a goal by midfielder Paul Caligiuri against Trinidad and Tobago sent the United States to the 1990 World Cup — and into a new era in its soccer history. The goal was called the shot heard ’round the world, and it began a run of seven consecutive World Cup appearances.

As FIFA brought its crown jewel to new continents in the decades that followed, every host avoided the ignominy of making its World Cup debut on home soil. South Korea was a regular in the tournament long before it hosted in 2002, and its co-host, Japan, made its debut in 1998. Even South Africa, the 2010 host, had been in the tournament twice before.

Ahead of the April 2016 draw for the final round of qualification for Russia, Hassan al-Thawadi, the head of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the Qatari body overseeing organization of the 2022 World Cup, stressed how vital it was that the team qualified for Russia. “It is important that we are there,” he said at the time.

Yet Qatar started badly, with defeats in its first two qualifiers. With only the top two countries from the six-team group set to qualify automatically, Qatar fired its coach, the Uruguayan José Daniel Carreño, in September and replaced him with his countryman Jorge Fossati.

“It is very important to go to Russia,” Fossati said ahead of his first task, a game against South Korea in October. “It is important for our players to play at the highest level as much as possible, and it is important for the confidence of the country as a football power.”
