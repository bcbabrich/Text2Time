This evening, Mr. Hinson said "we agree with the thrust of the recommendations."

The safety board also said oxidizers, the class of chemicals that includes the oxygen generators in the Valujet crash, should not be transported in cargo compartments that lack smoke or fire detectors; Mr. Hinson responded that his agency had already begun a review of how oxidizers are shipped. The safety board is an independent agency chartered by Congress to make recommendations to regulatory authorities at all levels of government. The F.A.A. usually, but not always, follows the recommendations; for example, the safety board noted in the letter today that it had previously called for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers for cargo holds but that the aviation agency decided against such precautions.

The letter said a Pan Am Boeing 707 cargo plane crashed in November 1973 at Logan International Airport in Boston because of a fire started by materials that were improperly packaged. In addition, it cited a DC-10 parked at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago was destroyed by a fire after a technician mishandled an oxygen generator and an an American Airlines DC-9 had a fire in midflight in February 1988 because of unlabeled hazardous materials. That plane landed safely.

The letter said that the cause of the Everglades crash was still under investigation but that there might have been as many as 144 oxygen generators on board, which "created an extremely dangerous condition." They had been shipped without the protective caps that block them from being set off, the board said.

The generators had been removed from other Valujet planes by a contractor after their shelf life had expired, but they had not been "fired," meaning that the oxygen-producing chemical reaction had not been set off. Such a step would have changed the generators from a hazard capable of starting fires to a chemical compound that can no longer burn or explode. It is mildly hazardous because it includes toxic barium salts, but it is enclosed in a stainless-steel canister.

Valujet and a contractor that had removed the generators from other Valujet aircraft, Sabretech, have publicly disagreed over whose fault it was that the generators were not fired.
