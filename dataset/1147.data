When Stone Phillips, formerly of “Dateline NBC,” learned of a first-of-its-kind study in 2011 at Virginia Tech about the magnitude of head impacts on youth football players, his journalistic instincts kicked in.

“I thought the study was really important, and I wanted to get it out there,” he said.

So Mr. Phillips, who sustained two concussions as a high school and college football player, began reporting, and he eventually paid to produce his own news report about the subject. The report, about 14 minutes long and featuring his on-camera interviews with researchers, would not have looked out of place on “Dateline,” where he was a co-anchor until 2007. But instead he posted it on his own barebones Web site, StonePhillipsReports.com. The report compares youth football players who are battered by tackles to “bobblehead dolls.”

Now, in a twist that may reveal something about the way the media world works these days, Mr. Phillips’s online report, called “Hard Hits, Hard Numbers,” is being used for television. On Monday night, PBS is scheduled to show a slightly condensed version on the “NewsHour,” its flagship nightly newscast. His title will be special correspondent.



The show picked up the report after Linda Winslow, the “NewsHour” executive producer, was told about the Phillips Web site by Neal Shapiro, the president of the PBS station WNET in New York, who ran NBC News for a time when Mr. Phillips was there. For Mr. Phillips, it was just a happy, if unexpected, turn of events. “I did not have any plans for it to be broadcast,” he said. “I was perfectly happy to have it be on the Web site.”

PBS wound up covering a portion of his out-of-pocket expenses.

For the report, which was his first since leaving “Dateline,” Mr. Phillips hired a freelance television crew that he had used in the past. After the interviews were recorded in Virginia, a freelance editor came to Mr. Phillips’s home in a New York City suburb and set up his professional editing software in the home office to stitch the report together. Mr. Phillips subsequently cut about two minutes from it for Monday’s broadcast.

Mr. Phillips said he would be tackling a couple of other topics for his Web site in the future, including one on mental health and one on reading disabilities. But he will produce the projects on his own timetable. “The great thing about the Web,” he said, “is that I can do it the way I want to do it.”
