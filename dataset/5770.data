In Cape Town, he said, there would likely be a similar assembly soon, alluding to the violence there that has claimed at least 29 lives this week. Mr. Tshwete, a former political prisoner who spent 15 years on Robben Island, a jail in the ocean off Cape Town, told the crowd that the forces of resistence were not asking President Botha to rule blacks fairly but, instead, that blacks rule be allowed to rule themselves.

He warned the audience that, regardless of where they were in South Africa, they were in a ''war zone,'' and that acts of violence by the Government's security forces simply redoubled the efforts of the Government's opponents.

''We will use practically everything,'' he said, asserting that the resistence forces were prepared to set the country ablaze.

Advocates Fighting Back

''We are going to kick them, we are going to use our fists if it comes to that, we are going to even shoot them if it comes to that,'' he said. ''We are not going to be killed like this and say there is room for nonviolent struggle in South Africa.

''We can't allow a situation where our people disappear at night and still talk in terms of nonviolent struggle,'' he continued. ''Apartheid is a violent system.''

Mr. Tshwete, whom the Government had banished from South Africa and who is supposed to be restricted to a remote corner of the so-called homeland of Ciskei, made similar strong statements at the funeral on Aug. 11 for Victoria Mxenge, a civil rights lawyer who was gunned down and axed earlier this month by four unidentified assailants outside her home in a Durban township. Many black activists here have said they believed she was killed by agents of the Government security forces.

Mrs. Mxenge's funeral sparked the rage here in Duncan Village, as it did in many other black townships. Youths of this township returned home from her funeral that evening and immediately burned down the Government Administration office, beer halls, and the homes of some community councilors, who are widely viewed as puppets of the Government.
