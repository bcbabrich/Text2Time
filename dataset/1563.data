From Rake. Styled by William Gilchrist.

Rake, a new men’s line of suit separates made to mix and match, fancies as its customer ‘‘a gentleman of rogue habits.’’ The owner, Clive Darby, late of the Savile Row outfitter Kilgour, marries the precision of English tailoring with the louche sexiness of Serge Gainsbourg. ‘‘He didn’t follow some dictated idea of what a suit should be,’’ Darby says. ‘‘He wore it with jeans, with sneakers or with fabulous brogues.’’ The whole collection — reversible waistcoats, wrinkle-resistant jersey jackets that pair well with booze-stained undershirts — targets global gadabouts who travel light. Jackets from about $1,545. Go to rakestyle.com.
