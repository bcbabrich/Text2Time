So the corporate digs need spiffing up and you think some original art sure would be nice over the reception desk, or in the conference room. True, you could get some by-the-numbers original oils, or an old master print -- but you want something with a bit more class.

Still, at today's art prices? Forget it.

Ian Peck has heard that cry, and today he plans to start a Web site, fineartlease.com, that, as its name implies, leases original artwork.

The good stuff includes the likes of N. C. Wyeth, Chagall, Hockney. Browse the site's gallery; if a painting grabs your fancy, it can be had for as little as three months or as much as 10 years -- at, say, roughly $1,400 a month for a painting valued at $75,000.

In a world where so much is borrowed, why should art be any different? Think of the tax deduction on those lease payments -- starting at 15 percent of the painting's value a year. Mr. Peck cites the tax benefit as a big selling point.
