Indeed, yesterday traders shrugged off a gross domestic product report that showed the economy grew at its fastest pace in a decade during the last quarter. Instead, investors were pleased by signs that the economy continued to show few signs of inflationary pressure.

''At some level, what could be better than strong G.D.P. and low inflation?'' said Frederick Taylor, chief investment officer at U.S. Trust. ''It looks like the economy is continuing on the fairly strong side, but inflation is surprisingly subdued.''

That news buoyed prices of shares in the broader indexes, too, all of which outperformed the Dow yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 7.29 points, to 801.34 -- also its highest close since March 12, and the Nasdaq composite rose 18.13, to 1,260.76.

Analysts said that recent gains might be attributed, in part, to the return of once reluctant investors who are now more confident that the market is stable.

''If there was any money sitting on the sidelines, it's coming back in now,'' said Kenneth Ducey, director of trading at BT Brokerage. ''People are really afraid of missing out; it shows there's a lot of enthusiasm in the market place.''
