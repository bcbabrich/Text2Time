The Mobil Oil Coropration announced yesterday that it planned to add Howard L. Clark, chairman and chief executive officer of the American Express Company, and Dr. Eleanor Bernert Sheldon, president of the Social Science Research Council of New York, to its board.

Dr. Sheldon, who would be the first woman to serve on Mobil's board, is a director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, the Rand Corporation, the First National City Corporation and Citibank, as well as a number of public bodies.

Stockholders are expected to vote on the two nominees and thus increase the board to 17 members at the next meeting, May 6, at Phoenix.
