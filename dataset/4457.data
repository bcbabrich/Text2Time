"One of the possibilities is the Carolinas, where we have an existing plant that belongs to our Freightliner subsidiary," Mr. Reuter said. "We are examining other places as well." Freightliner is the United States' largest producer of heavy trucks, and has three North Carolina plants, in Mount Holly, Cleveland and Gastonia.

The Carolinas are attractive because of lower levels of unionization and pay scales than in other parts of the country. It is also familiar turf for corporate Germany. More than 100 German companies already have subsidiaries in the two states, including the chemical giants Hoechst A.G. and BASF A.G.

Mr. Reuter said that several company objectives argued for a plant in the United States: "It ranges from our plans to broaden our product palette with a new vehicle, a fun car that will find a market in the United States, to wanting to not to be dependent on unstable exchange rates."

Mr. Reuter said Mercedes planned a new sport utility vehicle or station wagon-type vehicle, possibly with four-wheel drive. Production would be between 50,000 and 100,000 units annually, he said; that would be about half or less than the output of a typical car plant. The vehicle would be produced for the American market but likely for export as well.

Last year BMW A.G. selected Greer, a suburb of Spartanburg, S.C., for an assembly plant that is scheduled to start production by 1995. Almost all Japanese auto makers already build cars or light trucks at one or more plants in North America. Volkswagen A.G., which built cars in New Stanton, Pa., until the mid-1980's is considering an American plant again for its Audi division.
