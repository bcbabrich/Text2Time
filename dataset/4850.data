B-2 or not B-2? Once again, that is the question as a Congressional conference committee convenes to resolve differences on the defense budget. The President wanted full funding for four of the bat-winged Stealth bombers in this year's budget. The Senate went along by a narrow 51-to-48 vote. But the House overwhelmingly gave the right answer to the question, how many B-2's does the nation need: None.

President Bush's insistence on spending $3.2 billion for more B-2's, along with $5.2 billion he wants for strategic defenses, contradicts his own appreciation of modern realities. Consider what he said Friday: "New leaders in the Kremlin and the republics are now questioning the need for their huge nuclear arsenal." The Warsaw Pact has "crumbled." And any threat of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe has evaporated.

"As a result," he rightly concludes, "we now have an unparalleled opportunity to change the nuclear posture of both the United States and the Soviet Union." Then why buy four more B-2's? Mr. Bush offers no convincing answer.

Congress is already committed to building 15 of the bombers; the Pentagon wants 75 eventually. The B-2's staunchest defender in Congress, Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, now says no more than half that number need be built. Even that figure looks reckless considering President Bush's view, expressed Friday, that "we can dramatically shrink the arsenal of the world's weapons."
