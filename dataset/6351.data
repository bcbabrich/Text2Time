Ability Replaces Glamour

In other words, the 1970 Yankees will represent a com plete turnaround from the Yan kees of the late 1960's. Then they had residual glamour, with Mantle, Ford and Elston How ard playing out their final years and Joe Pepitone livening up the scene in his own way. But they had a basically flawed ball club. Now they have no glamour — but more playing ability.

It was nice, of course, hav ing both. But it may turn out that it‐ is more satisfying to all concerned, this year, to have the ability rather than the glamour if it has to be only one.

Mantle is a perfect example of the problem.

In his last few years he was a pale imitation of the real (or legendary) Mantle. That the Yankees could not do without him for reasons of fan senti ment, gate appeal and inspira tional force were facts that ev eryone accepted. But the more significant fact was that Man tle, hobbled and aging, was still one of the most productive players the Yankees had at the time—and that was the trouble.

As Mantle, Ford and Howard ‘slowed down, no one could really replace them even in their final stages.

At last this is no longer true.

Lee MacPhail (who is also unglamorous, but enormously effective) is starting to get re sults as general manager. No one can legitimately demand that the Yankees should be contender this year in a divi sion with. Baltimore, Boston and Detroit—but no one need be overwhelmingly surprised if they turn out to be.
