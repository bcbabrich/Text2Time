The authorities in the southern Italian port of Bari said a naval aircraft and a warship were ordered today to patrol the waters where the boat sank on Friday, when 34 survivors and the bodies of three women and one man were recovered. Vessels of the Finance Guard, a Finance Ministry coast guard unit, and of several southern Italian port authorities joined the search, they said.

The search came in response to a statement on Sunday by Albania's Ambassador in Rome, backed by his Government, that as many as 117 people, including dozens of women and children, had been aboard the boat. The Ambassador, Pandeli Pasko, said today on Italian television that the 83 missing people were presumed to have died.

The Albanian boat was a harbor patrol boat that was commandeered in Vlore last week and was ferrying refugees to Italy. It was intercepted on Friday evening by a patrol boat of the Italian Navy as it approached Bari. According to Italian accounts, the boats collided after the Albanian boat sought to maneuver its way past the Italian ship.

The Albanian boat was struck broadside and sank. Some of the Albanian survivors contended that the collision was intentional. The Italian ship picked up the 34 survivors and four bodies on Friday night, but the search was interrupted because of darkness and bad weather.

In Rome, the Government proceeded with plans to send the military contingent, despite appeals by opposition political leaders to postpone it because Albanians angered by the naval accident might pose a threat to the safety of the Italian soldiers. Other nations -- including Greece, Romania, France, Spain, Portugal and Turkey -- have also said they will contribute units.

Italy's handling of the boat episode provoked a wave of soul-searching among Italian political leaders. Enrico Jacchia, a Senator from the opposition Northern League, said the contingent should be delayed until a parliamentary discussion can lay down clear rules of engagement in Albania. He he said ''the most prudent estimates'' are that since the current crisis began, rebels and outlaws in Albania have stolen 100,000 light arms from Government arsenals.

Alessandra Mussolini, a deputy of the right-wing National Alliance, whose grandfather, the dictator Benito Mussolini, sent troops to occupy Albania in 1939, said Rome should rethink deploying the military contingent, ''unless we want to send so many young people to be massacred.''
