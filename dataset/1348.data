Cheryl Scarboro, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission‘s foreign bribery unit, is leaving the agency to join the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

Ms. Scarboro, 47, will work in the firm’s Washington office and focus on government and internal investigations.

Her move comes after spending nearly two decades at the S.E.C., where she held a range of roles. As a lawyer in the enforcement division, she brought several insider trading cases. She also served as counsel to Arthur Levitt Jr., who was the agency’s chairman during the Clinton administration.

Last year, Ms. Scarboro became the agency’s top official enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids companies from bribing foreign officials.

Her biggest foreign bribery case, an investigation of Siemens, led to an $800 million settlement, the largest such agreement to date. She also led the S.E.C.’s investigation into payments made to the Iraqi government to secure business from the United Nation’s Oil-for-Food Program.

“We are delighted to welcome Cheryl to the firm,” Pete Ruegger, chairman of Simpson Thacher’s executive committee, said in a statement. “Her extensive experience in high-profile S.E.C. investigations and enforcement actions, particularly involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, will enhance our talented government and internal investigations practice group.”
