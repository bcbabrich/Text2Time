Randy Johnson has a four-game losing streak in the playoffs after being outpitched by Kevin Brown on Tuesday in Houston's 2-1 loss to San Diego. But Johnson may get a chance to break that streak -- and possibly face Brown again -- sooner than anybody thought.

With his team in an early hole, losing at home and trailing by 1-0 in the three-of-five-game division series, Houston Manager Larry Dierker today raised the possibility of starting Johnson in Game 3 in San Diego on Saturday. Dierker said he had heard the Padres might start Brown on Saturday on three days' rest, something San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy and the Padres' pitching coach, Dave Stewart, confirmed.

Even if Brown, who struck out 16 Astros in Game 1, does not pitch on Saturday, Johnson might.

''We might do it if it gets down two games to none,'' Dierker said. ''It could get to the point that even if it isn't the best idea, you're going to get killed in the media if you don't do it.'' Shane Reynolds of the Astros will face Andy Ashby of the Padres in Game 2 on Thursday.

''I'm not going to think about it very much until after tomorrow's game,'' Dierker said.

In Game 1, Johnson allowed two runs and nine hits, with a walk and nine strikeouts, in eight innings. He did not pitch on three days' rest this season, but Dierker said, ''When he first came over, he told me he could do it.'' In 1995, Johnson won the deciding fifth game of the Seattle Mariners' dramatic division series victory over the Yankees, pitching three innings of relief on one day's rest after he had pitched seven strong innings to win Game 3.
