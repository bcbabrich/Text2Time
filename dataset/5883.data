PHEW, but that was a close call! They actually picked one of my numbers during the big Pick-Six drawing on Dec. 2. That means I was only five numbers away from $11 million, and I can't begin to tell you what a relief it was to lose.

You see, lotteries don't pay off winners in old money, the kind that comes with a degree from Princeton and a sensible, tweedy wardrobe. No, they pay off in new money.

Do you know what would happen to me if I ever won $11 million in new money? First, I would buy a bunch of gold chains and shirts that glow in the dark. Then I would go down to the nearest Cadillac showroom and pick out a car, probably a pink one with whitewalls and lots of velour inside. Then I would drive it to a customizing shop and replace the Cadillac emblem with a new ornament, perhaps a swan.

I would drive around in my pink Caddy, shopping for a vacant lot on which to build my new home. I'd then hire an architect from the Yellow Pages and tell him that I like things pink and shiny, and that there had to be a Jacuzzi in every room.
