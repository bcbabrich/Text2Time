In a series of votes yesterday, Israel's parliament made clear its uneasiness over peace talks with the Palestinians. But at the end of the day, Prime Minister Ehud Barak remains in office with a chance to revive the compromises discussed at the failed Camp David summit meetings if the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, shows more flexibility on Jerusalem. Polls show that Israeli voters are far more willing than their elected representatives to support reasonable compromises as the price of a durable peace.

Parliament's biggest surprise was Moshe Katsav's upset of Shimon Peres for the largely ceremonial office of president. Mr. Peres, a former prime minister and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, was an architect of the Oslo peace agreement with the Palestinians in 1993. He is one of the last active members of Israel's founding generation and has made great contributions to Israel's development and its survival during his six decades in political life.

Mr. Peres's presidential candidacy was backed by Mr. Barak's One Israel Party and seemed assured a majority. But he fell four votes short in the secret ballot election and lost to Mr. Katsav, a veteran of the conservative Likud Party. As president, Mr. Katsav will receive credentials from diplomats, issue pardons recommended by the government and carry out other honorary functions. Born in Iran, he is Israel's first president with non-European origins, a welcome advance for a group long excluded from the top ranks of the Israeli political establishment.

Of more immediate political significance were two failed votes of no confidence in the Barak government. Various parties are unhappy with some of the concessions discussed at Camp David, like turning over up to 90 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian rule and allowing some Palestinian sovereignty within Jerusalem. But they could not muster the required 61 votes, in part because these parties fear new elections would erode their current strength.
