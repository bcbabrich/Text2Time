TRENTON, May 31 - Douglas R. Forrester continues to vastly outspend his six rivals for the New Jersey Republican nomination for governor, and during the last month alone used $2.4 million of his own money to pay for television commercials and other campaign expenses, according to records released on Tuesday.

Mr. Forrester, the only candidate to advertise on New York and Philadelphia broadcast stations, has now spent $8,971,114 on the race, more than all the other contenders combined. Bret D. Schundler, the party's nominee for governor in 2001, reported the next-highest cumulative spending total, $1,778,156, much of which paid for direct mail.

With the June 7 primary a week away, Mr. Forrester's wealth and willingness to self-finance has helped him to build a lead in the polls. He has run television commercials promoting his property tax relief plan and blasting Mr. Schundler, and this week debuted a radio ad aimed at United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the de facto Democratic nominee.

Mr. Schundler and Mr. Forrester have been far ahead of the other five Republicans in virtually every poll, but because Mr. Schundler lacks the money to run his own ads, he has used some unconventional tactics. At a debate two weeks ago, he offered $250 to any viewer who could find any New Jersey elected official who had raised taxes more than Mr. Forrester did during as mayor of West Windsor in the early 1980's.
