This week’s quandary came from a message J. sent via Facebook: How, she asked, can we keep the children in our great, family-friendly neighborhood from hanging out with us in our yard — all the time?

J.’s block sounds pretty idyllic. “Kids run around unsupervised, go from one yard to another without thinking about boundaries, neighbors know each others’ kids …” Which means that whenever there’s a backyard activity, suddenly, there’s a whole party of children ready and willing to jump in. That’s great if you’re a kid at loose ends for the afternoon, and not so great if you’re trying to have an outdoor party with just visiting family, or just don’t feel like having the whole neighborhood in your backyard.

My husband, who works from home and so is available after school at times a lot of working parents aren’t (including me), wants to toss a football or visit the river to explore with our boys in the afternoon. He expresses frustration that he wants to share those experiences with his own sons, not a larger group of neighborhood kids.

J. knows this is a good problem to have, but still, it’s a problem, if only one of tact and etiquette. She doesn’t want to be unfriendly, and often, the neighborhood kids are perfectly welcome at her house, just as her children often are at other houses on the block.

“We just wonder,” she writes, “how to communicate ‘this is family time’ or ‘this is a backyard gathering, spontaneous and casual, but you’re still not invited,’ without alienating others,” particularly when those others are just kids.
