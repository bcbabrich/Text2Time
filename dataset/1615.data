Fisk University in Nashville, which wants to sell a $30 million ownership stake in its Stieglitz art collection to raise money, plans to appeal a court decision that set limits on the sale, the university announced on Wednesday.

The ownership stake is going to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., but the sale has raised concerns among those who question the university’s need to sell items given to it as a public trust by the artist Georgia O’Keeffe, who married the photographer Alfred Stieglitz.

The university filed a notice with the Davidson County Chancery Court in Nashville that it would appeal the Nov. 3 ruling that Fisk could spend only $10 million of the $30 million at its discretion. The remainder would be placed in an independent endowment fund and Fisk would be allowed to use only about $1 million of income from the endowment to support the collection, which was donated to the university about 50 years ago.

“This restriction effectively confiscates proceeds from the approved sharing agreement and places Fisk in a more risky position than before,” said Hazel R. O’Leary, Fisk’s president, in a statement.

Fisk’s chairman, Robert W. Norton, added, “The order will result in an excessive endowment for the art collection while ignoring the need to endow Fisk’s outstanding academic programs for which it has received national recognition.”
