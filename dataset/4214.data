After getting knocked out in a non-title bout at Atlantic City yesterday, the junior middleweight BUDDY McGIRT announced he was retiring. McGirt, 31, dropped to 64-5-1 after being floored by ANDREW COUNCIL in the ninth round of the scheduled 10-round bout.

"The punches mounted up," said McGirt, a two-time world champion. "I knew I was definitely behind. After the first knockdown I thought, 'Who turned out the lights?' My left hand has never been the same since the operation."

McGirt filed a lawsuit Feb. 24 in United States District Court claiming a doctor failed to properly diagnose and treat his left shoulder two months before he lost to PERNELL WHITAKER in March 1993. (AP)
