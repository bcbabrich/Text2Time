-cardstock paper for informational brochures (optional)

Activities / Procedures:

NOTE TO TEACHER: As with all controversial subjects, the topic of sex education should be approached with great sensitivity. Please adjust the content of this lesson plan, if necessary, to suit your school’s curriculum, standards, and policies, as well as students’ level of awareness and understanding.

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Ask students to respond to the following question, written on the board prior to class: “What are the pros and cons of ‘abstinence-only’ sex education?” Allow time for students to consider the question, and then record their answers on the board. For reference, create a chart illustrating the ‘pros’ and ‘cons.’

2. As a class, read and discuss “Abstinence-Only: Does It Work?,” using the following questions:

a. What approach to sex education must school receiving federal funding take?

b. How does an “abstinence-only” sex education curriculum account for the discussion of contraception?

c. According to the article, why might abstinence-only sex education be unrealistic?

d. Who is Cynthia Dailard, and what is her position on abstinence-only sex education?

e. What are some of the studies mentioned in the article, and what were their results?

f. What analogy does Tobe Goldberg make to describe her perspective on abstinence-only education?

g. According to the article, why might some teenagers’ definition of sex cause problems?

h. When and how did abstinence-only sex education begin in the United States?

i. How much federal funding has abstinence-only education received since 1996?

j. How much did abstinence-only education receive this year?

k. How much federal funding for abstinence-only has President Bush requested for 2005?

l. How many children born in the United States have teenage mothers, according to the article?

m. According to the article, how does the rate of teenage pregnancy in the United States compare to other developed countries?

n. How does the rate of sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents in the United States compare to other countries?

o. According to the article, how many sexually active teenagers will contract an S.T.D. by the time they are 18?

p. What did President Bush mean when he said that “abstinence works every time,” and to whom did he make that statement?

q. According to the American Psychological Association study cited by Ms. Dailard, what percentage of college students who had pledged virginity in their earlier years had broken their vow to remain abstinent until marriage?

3. Explain to students that they will be working in groups to create informational brochures exploring specific health issues related to sex. Ask students to brainstorm a list of research topics, while you note them on the board. Some ideas mentioned in the article, “Abstinence-Only: Does It Work?” include S.T.D.’s, pregnancy, and methods of contraception.

Ultimately, the list should include topics such as: the transmission, physical symptoms, and effects of a specific sexually transmitted disease (such as gonorrhea, syphilis, H.I.V., or H.P.V.); pregnancy (from conception to birth); the risks associated with non-intercourse sexual activity; and how different methods of contraception work to prevent pregnancy or transmission of disease, if appropriate for your curriculum (see NOTE TO TEACHER above).

Divide students into small groups and ask each group to select a topic from the list written on the board. Each group’s topic should be approved prior to researching to avoid overlap of subject matter and ensure appropriateness within the curriculum. Encourage students to research information from reputable sources of health information, such as health and science textbooks, and local, national, and international organizations without specific biases or political agendas.

Once research is completed, groups should review their notes and begin outlining their brochure. Encourage students to divide tasks evenly to ensure equitable contributions to the project.

4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Groups should work cooperatively to complete their brochures, which will be presented in a future class. Individually, students prepare written reflections about the importance of sex education. What should be included in a sex education curriculum for your peers? Why? What should not be included? Why?

In a future class, groups present their brochures to the class and discuss the value of sex education curricula.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is your own personal opinion of abstinence-only sex education? Why do you feel this way?

–Do you think schools that choose to offer information on contraception should still receive federal funding? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on contributions to class discussions, completion of group research and brochure about a particular health issue pertaining to sex, and thoughtfully written reflection papers.

Vocabulary:

advocate, improbable, refrains, S.T.D., ample, refute, premise, adequate, nonprofit, reproductive, contraception, incidence, pledged, virginity, interim, fiscal, condom, ineffective, use-effectiveness

Extension Activities:

1. Create a survey asking your fellow students about your school’s sex education program. Do they feel as if they receive too much, sufficient, or not enough information? Publish your results in an article for the school (or local) newspaper.

2. Investigate one of the studies mentioned in the article, “Abstinence-Only: Does It Work?” Read and analyze the study, then create a presentation to be given during class. What type of methodology did the researchers use? How large was the sample population? What were some of the results?

3. Make a glossary of terms with which you think teens should be familiar regarding health, hygiene, and sexuality.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics- Write a research paper examining the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. Aside from offering matching funds to states with abstinence-only curricula in their schools, what are some of the other goals or purposes for this legislation? Research the history, passing, and implementation of this act.

Economics- If President Bush receives the requested $273 million for abstinence-only education in the 2005 fiscal year, what percentage of federal education funding will that be? How does it compare to other components of the federal budget?

Global History- Create a poster illustrating some of the health-related sex issues faced in a country other than your own. Include information about who is affected (both directly and indirectly), reasons why this issue exists in this particular country, and what the country or global community is doing to help change this problem.

Media Studies- Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban’s 2004 film, “Saved!,” satirizes evangelical Christianity among American teenagers, and addresses issues of teenage sexuality and pregnancy. Screen the film with a group of your classmates and organize a post-film discussion.
