Carl T. Hayden, the chancellor of the Board of Regents, and Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, said that they would not consider postponing the policy because it was already proving a success. Mr. Mills said that easing the graduation requirements even temporarily would be ''absurd'' and ''unjust,'' because it would send a signal that not every student should be held to high expectations.

''It is a bogus argument to suggest that some students can't achieve at the levels we have set,'' Mr. Mills said. ''And it is an absurd proposal to stop at the very moment when teachers, school administrators and, above all, children, are demonstrating success.''

Mr. Hayden said he was surprised at the former regents' opposition to the new graduation policy, because Ms. Gluck and Ms. Matteoni participated in the discussions leading up to its adoption and voted for the requirements in 1996.

But the women said that when they voted to require all students to take the Regents exams, they did not realize that test scores would be the only factor determining whether students got diplomas.

''The thinking at that point was that everyone would take the exams, but you could get a diploma through other channels,'' Ms. Gluck said. ''There was never the sense that everyone would be expected to reach the exact same goals in the exact same way.''

Under the old system, students had two options: getting a local diploma by passing a set of basic competency tests, or getting a more prestigious Regents diploma by passing the more difficult Regents exams. When the Board of Regents adopted the new policy in 1996, less than 40 percent of students statewide -- and less than 25 percent of New York City students -- were graduating with Regents diplomas.

Ms. Gluck and Ms. Matteoni said that while they had supported phasing out the basic competency tests, it was with the understanding that the Regents would come up with other ways of meeting graduation requirements. Students who aspire to become chefs or mechanics should not necessarily be held to the same standard as students who want to attend Ivy League colleges, they said.
