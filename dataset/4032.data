Six years ago, Eric and Virginia Holst exchanged their wedding vows standing side by side at the altar of St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church here on Main Street and Ocean Avenue. Today, their coffins rested side by side before the same altar.

Dr. and Mrs. Holst had boarded Trans World Airlines Flight 800 planning to celebrate their sixth anniversary in Paris. The crash brought them home.

Until Flight 800 fell from the sky, most of the world had never heard of the Long Island inlet towns called the Moriches. But the Holsts had lived right nearby, in Manorville, and Dr. Holst, a dentist, practiced at Moriches Dental Associates on Main Street.

Hundreds of people crowded the oatmeal-colored church with a green-tiled roof for the funeral this morning as the towns that have played host to a world of grief paused to mourn two of their own.
