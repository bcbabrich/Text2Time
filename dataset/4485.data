Less than a year after Oregon voters turned down the strongest measure against gay rights that was ever considered by a state, proponents of the measure have come right back with several election victories at the local level.

In a two-week election by mail whose ballots were counted Tuesday night, all of the four largely rural counties and two small towns that voted on the issue approved, by lopsided margins, a somewhat toned-down version of last fall's statewide measure, which would have deemed homosexuality "abnormal and perverse" and allowed discrimination against homosexuals.

The four counties -- Josephine, Douglas, Linn and Klamath -- and the two towns, Junction City and Canby, had been chosen by anti-gay forces that undertook petition drives leading to the voting because residents there had strongly backed the state measure. In the six elections combined, approximately 90,000 people cast votes. The entire state has a population of just under 3 million.

The initiatives approved on Tuesday prohibit local governments from doing anything to "promote" homosexuality, and bar laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination. No Laws in Place
