Thanksgiving weekend is not only a big business opportunity for department stores, malls and airlines; the four-day weekend ranks among the top sales and rental periods of the year for retail video stores. This year, Thanksgiving was bigger than ever in some markets.

Marc Oringer, the general manager of Champagne Video, which has four stores in Manhattan, said business was ''at least 20 percent bigger than last year, especially with the rainy, nasty weather that kept the kids in the house.''

Mark Papia, publisher of Video Business magazine, said Thanksgiving was ''undoubtedly the busiest rental weekend of the year.'' Christmas and New Year's are also big, especially when they fall on a Thursday, as they will this year.

Mr. Oringer said sales had been strong for the recent video releases, ''Men in Black,'' ''The Lost World'' and ''Batman and Robin.'' ''We've had to reload on all of them,'' he said.
