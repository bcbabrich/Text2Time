AT the peak of the New York Cares Coat Drive, its distribution center -- donated warehouse space at the Chelsea Market in Manhattan -- was a mountain range of shapes and colors. Thousands of used coats that had been contributed to the drive were sorted into categories: men's, women's and children's; large, medium and small.

Colleen Farrell stopped sorting one morning to admire an extra-large lined leather coat with a fur-trimmed hood. It ended up in one of the bags that Nathaniel Thompson, 56, took to St. Bartholomew's Church in Midtown.

Those who came to the church's soup kitchen were told that anyone needing a coat could go outside to Mr. Thompson's van. Theotis Allen, 46 and homeless, wanted something to replace a much-too-thin coat.

Mr. Thompson pulled out the leather coat. Mr. Allen put it on and headed off to find a place for the night. Maybe he would try Penn Station, though he had been kicked out before. He crossed Fifth Avenue talking about how much he enjoyed Rockefeller Center this time of year. It felt like snow was coming, but at least he was warmer. NICOLE BENGIVENO
