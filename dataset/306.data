WILD NIGHTS

How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World

By Benjamin Reiss

305 pages. Basic Books. $28.

The night before I stopped sleeping, I slept. This is something I try to explain to any well-meaning person who asks about my mysterious, pigheaded, yearslong case of insomnia. It came on abruptly. It was precipitated by no crisis I could discern. It was not the culmination of many years of poor or varied sleep. One day, I simply closed my eyes and nothing happened. It was as if I’d been poisoned.

Whenever a self-help book about sleep crosses my desk, I toss it. I already know what it says. Not getting enough: Bad. Pills: Avoid. Sunlight: Essential. But when I saw Benjamin Reiss’s “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World,” I lunged for it, and it wouldn’t surprise me if my fellow travelers in exhaustion had the same response. Certainly, strangers reacted favorably to Reiss while the book was still in progress. As he writes in his epilogue: “Something about becoming the Sleep Guy seems to have made me a magnet for interesting divulgences and unusual conversations.”

Most people, even those who sleep well, have at least one story about a brutal cage match with Morpheus.

What makes “Wild Nights” so liberating is that it is descriptive, not prescriptive. It does not hector. It barely engages with the science of slumber at all. It aims, rather, to describe the social history and evolving culture of sleep — through literature (Reiss is an English professor at Emory University), through ethnographies, through old diaries and memoirs and medical texts.
