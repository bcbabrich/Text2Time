Tonight, Israel had further cause for rejoicing when it won a second medal in judo, this one a bronze that went to Shay Oren Smadga in the men's lightweight division (156 1/2 pounds).

While the Munich killings had a devastating impact on the sports world, it is generally not dwelt upon by most Israelis, who have since endured countless other terrorist raids and several wars that form important parts of the national fabric. As it turned out, Arad's performance was the sweet close to what had been yet another blood-soaked day in Israel, one in which 2 people were killed and nearly 50 others injured in an explosion at a munitions plant, and in which, several hours later, a Jerusalem policeman was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant who in turn was shot and killed.

There were evocations of Munich recently when Yediot Ahronot, citing classified documents reportedly obtained from the Bavaria state prosecutor's office, stated that at least eight of the Israeli athletes were killed not by their Palestinian kidnappers but by German police officers during a rescue attempt.

The Bavarian Justice Minister, Mathilde Berghofer-Weichner, responded by saying the official investigations had concluded that none of the Israelis died from police fire, and denied knowledge of any contrary evidence.

But instead of Munich and its painful memories, most Israelis preferred today to focus on Yael Arad and her moment of glory (although a few people could not hide their glee over the fact that she had defeated a German to reach the finals).

Arad, one of five children in a family from Herzliya on the Mediterranean coast just north of Tel Aviv, has been the standout of a 31-member Israeli team that has thus far failed to dazzle.

She took up judo at the age of 8, and says that since completing her compulsory army service five years ago she has dedicated herself almost exclusively to the sport, including annual trips to Japan for training sessions. Last year, she finished third in the European judo championship.
