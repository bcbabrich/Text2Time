Cable operators balked at supporting the creation of ESPN in a market that already had Fox Sports West, which carried Angels games, and Fox Sports West 2, which telecast Mighty Ducks games. Once the ESPN West plan died, Fox extended the Angels and Mighty Ducks' deals for an additional 10 years each.

''Without ESPN West, owning the teams just isn't worth it for Disney,'' said John Moag, managing director of the sports industry group at Legg Mason, an investment bank based in Baltimore.

It is possible that if Disney had successfully started ESPN West -- and figured it had reached its goal to improve the business climate for Disneyland in Anaheim by owning the Angels and the Mighty Ducks -- it might have sold the teams but kept their television rights.

The allure of combining its teams with a cable television property was tantalizing to Disney, allowing it to reap revenue from gate receipts, advertising and cable fees. In New York, Cablevision does it by owning the Knicks and Rangers and the MSG Network, which carries their games locally.

The Fox Sports Group owns the Dodgers and shows their games on its Fox Sports West channel.

Beyond the failure to start ESPN West, Disney is looking to boost its stock price and earnings by selling non-core businesses to focus on theme parks, film and television production, videos and retailing. Last month, it agreed to sell Fairchild Publications for $650 million.

The company is doing well with its ownership of ESPN, but is working to improve lackluster results at the third-place ABC network.

The teams might not have become expendable had they been profitable, league champions, or had Disney's stock continued to soar as it had when the Eisner-led company never seemed to make a misstep.
