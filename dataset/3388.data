To the Editor:

Re ''Florida's Legislative Tripwire'' (editorial, Nov. 30):

The Florida Legislature is not only the ultimate arbiter for the choosing of electors under the federal Constitution, but it is also better equipped institutionally for making this ultimate political decision than are state judicial actors.

Having a handful of unelected state judges and their coterie of trial lawyers decide who our next president should be is surely the least democratic option for solving this stalemate.

Would you argue against the Legislature's involvement if it weren't for the fact that only the courts hold out the faint hope that Vice President Al Gore, the candidate you endorsed, might win?
