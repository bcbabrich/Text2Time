Resources / Materials:

–student journals

–pens/pencils

–paper

–classroom blackboard

–copies of “Surprise! Educational Sites Are Cool” (one per student)

–computers with Internet access (one per group)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “How do you use the Internet outside of school (and not related to homework)? Do you ever go to the Web to learn about favorite sports, hobbies, events, or topics of particular interest to you? Explain. Would you consider any of this non-school-related Web activity educational? Why or why not?” After a few minutes, allow students to share their responses. Then as a class discuss the following question: What would a make an educational Web site fun?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Surprise! Educational Sites Are Cool,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What painting was George Tamburino investigating online?

b. How old is George?

c. On what trend with museums does this article focus?

d. What age groups has the Museum of Modern Art targeted online?

e. According to the article, what do museums hope to gain by developing Web sites for young people?

f. In what other ways have museums made use of the Internet, according to the article?

g. According to Jennifer Trant, why are education sites doing well?

h. Are the museum sites achieving their goals, according to the sources cited in the article? 3. Divide the class into six groups, and assign each group one of the following Web sites:

–Smithsonian Education (//smithsonianeducation.org/students/index.html)

–MOMA RedStudio (//redstudio.moma.org/)

–Exploratorium Science of Music (//www.exploratorium.edu/music/index.html)

–Learning @ Whitney (//whitney.org/learning/)

–AMNH Ology (//www.ology.amnh.org/)

–NGA Kids (//www.nga.gov/kids/)

Explain to students that each group will act as a team of curatorial advisors to evaluate a museum Web site targeted at kids. Each group will be evaluating the sites and offering their recommendations for changes and improvements to enhance the site’s educational and entertainment value. Each group should divide themselves into five subgroups, according to the following categories (copied in a handout or on an overhead for easier student access):

CONTENT

–Who is the target audience for this site?

–How well is the information (including text, graphics, music, animation, and video) communicated to the target audience?

–How would you evaluate the information for its clarity, usefulness, and ability to arouse interest in the target audience?

–Weighing all the above factors, assign a value to this site’s content on a scale of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent).

STRUCTURE AND NAVIGATION

–Who is the target audience for this site?

–How well is this site organized for the target audience?

–How easy and intuitive is it for a user to figure out how to move through the site?

–Is the breadth and depth of this site’s information easily apparent, and how efficiently can a user move through the site to learn the extent of what is being presented?

–Weighing all the above factors, assign a value to this site’s structure and navigation on a scale of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent).

VISUAL DESIGN

–Who is the target audience for this site?

–How would you describe the visual appeal of this site?

–How suited is the design to the target audience of the site?

–Would this site’s design appeal to users other than the target user? If so, which ones? If not, why not?

–Weighing all the above factors, assign a value to this site’s visual design on a scale of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent).

FUNCTIONALITY

–Who is the target audience for this site?

–Does the site use Internet technologies such as Flash, javascript, html, streaming audio or video? (Hint: In your browser, click on “View,” then scroll down and click on “Source.” A window will open showing the coding of this page.) List all that apply.

–How appropriate is the technology used on this site for the type of content being delivered to target users?

–How efficiently do pages load? Would this site work on a dial-up connection or does a user need a high-speed connection?

–Do all the links work?

–Weighing all the above factors, assign a value to this site’s functionality on a scale of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent).

INTERACTIVITY

–Who is the target audience for this site?

–In what ways (searches, chat rooms or messaging, games, feedback, participation in activities, etc.) does this site encourage users to interact with the content? List all that apply.

–How does this interactivity enhance a user’s understanding of the content?

–Weighing all the above factors, assign a value to this site’s interactivity on a scale of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent).

[Note: These categories are adapted from the Webby Awards judging criteria (//www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/criteria.html). Students should be encouraged to read the category criteria on this page before assigning a rating.]

After 10 to 15 minutes, allow each group to come together to discuss the Overall Experience of their site. Students should add up their category rating points, and assign a rating value to the site as a whole on a scale of 1 to 30. Depending on the group’s consensus, they may wish to alter the rating up or down if they feel one category has a particularly strong influence on a user’s overall experience. In addition, students in each group should discuss whether the rating applies more to the site’s educational or entertainment value, or both, and be prepared to defend their judgments.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In a future class, allow groups to present an evaluation of each Web site, and allow students to ask questions about each category. As homework, each student should also respond to the following prompt: “Think about the Web site you explored in class. Then, based your memory of the site, answer the following questions: What did you like the best about the site? What did you like the least? Do you think the site was an effective place for learning about art, science, history or culture? Explain. Would you be inclined to visit this site again outside the classroom? Why or why not?”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What museums have you visited? Which ones stood out as providing an especially positive or negative experience? Explain why.

–Do you feel that information found on the Internet is equally, more, or less reliable than information from other sources? Why or why not?

–What do you think makes a work of art “good” or “bad”?

–Do you think art should be included in a school’s core curriculum along with subjects like mathematics, science and language arts? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal writing, thoughtful participation in class discussions, thorough evaluation of a museum Web site, and thoughtful reflection on the Web site’s overall success.

Vocabulary:

tutorial, intergalactic, stodgiest, helm, ventures, destination, analytical, constituencies, diligently, digitizing, subsidize, sluggish, reluctant, curricular, cultivating, theorized

Extension Activities:

1. Explore e-Arcades.com (//www.e-arcades.com/)), a site inspired by the late critic of art, culture and history, Walter Benjamin. His Arcades Project attempted to capture an “associative” view of history using a montage of quotations. Why are Web links an appropriate tool for honoring Benjamin’s ideas? How does the site use quotes and links to suggest layers of meaning about technology? Investigate Walter Benjamin’s life and work, and write a review of e-Arcades that explores the success of the Web site; submit your review to the site’s developer. In addition, you may wish to suggest a quote that you think would be appropriate to add to the site.

2. Visit a cultural institution (museum, library or historic site) in your area and develop a Web site to introduce kids to this institution. Diagram the site’s structure and navigation, and propose a design for the site’s homepage. Present it to the institution for consideration.

3. Visit the Digital Gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles (//www.moca.org/museum/digital_gallery.php). Chose one of the Internet-based works of art on display and write a review. In your view, is the Internet the best medium for this work of art? Why or why not?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics- How do museums support themselves? What income do they bring in that allows them to collect, preserve, and present works to the public? What fundraising ventures are available to them and what financial constraints are placed upon them? Interview a representative from a museum to learn about its financial health. Based on what you have learned, are you more likely to become a member or encourage others to join? Why or why not?

Journalism- Poll members of your community about their usage of the Internet. Then write an article about the most (and least) popular uses of the Internet. Submit this article to your local paper.

Media Studies- Watch a movie about a “misunderstood” artist, such as “Basquiat” (1996), “Pollack” (2000), or “Frida” (2002). Then write a review of the movie. How was this artist viewed in his or her time? Does the movie help you understand this artist’s work better? Why or why not? What risks did these artists take in their lives? Do you feel the insights and observations of these artists provided a valuable commentary about art and society, or were his or her ideas and behaviors frivolous and irresponsible? Explain why.
