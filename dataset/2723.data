To the Editor:

While Daniel Libeskind's design has admirable intentions, is it a fitting tribute to America's darkest day (front page, Feb. 27)?

It is striking that none of the proposed designs for the new trade center were ''bigger and better than before.'' That was the initial emotional response after the attack.

The best tribute to the 3,000 people who lost their lives and to the spirit of America would be to rebuild a trade center fitting to our spirit. One that echoes all our voices. One that is not compromised by terror.

And in my hope, one that is bigger and better than before.
