To find out if this is really so, Mr. Clark convened a panel of 25 listeners for an extended series of ''blind'' listening comparisons, cleverly arranged to avoid the pitfalls of of both subjectivity and statistics.

Without going into details about these rigorously controlled methods, it should be pointed out that each listener compared only two amplifiers at any time. But unlike the normal A-B comparison, Mr. Clark included a third choice in each test, known as amplifier X. Yet amplifier X was in fact either A or B, and the listener had to correctly identify it. The idea behind all this is that if X is correctly identified more often than mere random probability would lead one to expect, an audible difference between A and B evidently exists. What's more, Mr. Clark points out, if the statistics indicate such a difference, it is likely to be real even if the listener himself thinks that he hears no difference.

This was not the only method employed in this investigation, and the others were of equal procedural subtlety. Even the initial attitudes of the listeners were weighted in the results, the group being divided into ''believers'' who expected audible differences between various amplifiers and ''skeptics'' who did not.

The amplifiers compared in this way ranged all the way from the budget-priced Pioneer SX-1500 receiver, rated at 45 watts per channel (wpc) and listing at $219.95, to the ultra-deluxe Futterman OTL-1, which costs $12,000 in its stereo version. Between these extremes, listeners heard the Mark Levinson ML-11 (50 wpc, $2,000), the NAD 2200 (100 wpc, $548) and Hafler DH-120 (62 wpc, $320). These were chosen to represent typical price points in the long ladder from the bargain basement to the stratosphere, and despite their divergence in power ratings, they were all adjusted to be heard at precisely the same volume level.

Obviously, this level had to be moderate, so as to be within reach of the less powerful amplifiers in the group. What was being compared, after all, was not the amount of volume that could be created without distortion (in which case the more powerful models would clearly have excelled) but the timbral character of the sound at a normal listening level.
