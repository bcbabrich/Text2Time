WOLF OF SHADOWS By Whitley Strieber. 105 pp. New York: Sierra Club Books/ Alfred A. Knopf. $9.95. (Ages 5 to 9) NO matter how much we may wish to protect them, our children know they live under the shadow of a mushroom cloud.

The question for parents, teachers and authors of books for the young is: How do we speak to children about the unspeakable?

Like the wolves of his story who challenge a rival by staring it down, Whitley Strieber has chosen to address nuclear fears by facing them boldly. Mr. Strieber is the co-author with James W. Kunetka of ''Warday,'' a novel set in 1993, five years after the United States has ''won'' a limited one-day war against the Soviet Union. In a speech recently, Mr. Strieber said that although ''Warday'' was intended for an adult audience, much of the reaction to the book came from younger readers, one of whom asked the haunting question: ''What about the animals?''

''Wolf of Shadows'' is Mr. Strieber's answer to that concern. It is told from the point of view of a great black wolf who, after a nuclear attack, returns from self-imposed exile to lead his pack south in an attempt to escape from the cold and starvation brought on by nuclear winter. Two human survivors, mother and daughter, attach themselves to the wolf pack. It is a journey through frozen hell, tempered only by the fierce tenacity of Wolf of Shadows. His is the dominating presence in the book and readers will care more for him than for the human characters. Indeed, the one weak element in this otherwise powerful story is the human conversation, which feels like an intrusion, more a means of conveying information than an integral part of the narrative.
