Hordes of creatures living in the hidden depths of the deep sea are in danger of starving to death, scientists report. This remote part of the planet is believed to harbor millions of undiscovered species, an unknown number of which may be in crisis.

A study of food supply and demand miles down in the North Pacific between 1989 and 1996 found that creatures of the seabed suffered from growing food shortages. A likely culprit, scientists say, is a documented increase in sea surface temperatures during the same period.

''If the food deficit continues, it is going to change the configuration of the deep-sea communities,'' said Kenneth L. Smith Jr., a biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego and a co-author of the report, which was published recently in Science. ''Some species will die out while those that can survive on a very low food supply will still be able to maintain themselves.''

Little is known about the creatures of the darkness, much less about fluctuations in their diets and fortunes.
