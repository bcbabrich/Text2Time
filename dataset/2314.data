Under the this-is-interesting file, the Spitzer-Paterson campaign contributed $250,000 to the small but influential Working Families Party Wednesday afternoon.

The party has endorsed Spitzer-Paterson and mostly Democrats, but has also come out in support of four Republican Senators in their re-election bids — Joseph E. Robach, John DeFrancisco, Dale M. Volker and George D. Maziarz.

The party, however, has decided to stay neutral in the hotly contested Westchester Senate race, after supporting Senator Nick Spano, a Republican, in 2004.

Update: “Generally we are supportive of their broad policy goals and more specifically we are supporting their get out the vote efforts,” said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Spitzer campaign.
