PHILADELPHIA, July 31 (UPI) â€”A proposed civil rights March at the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City Aug. 24 was called off today by an official of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

Philip H. Savage said that he decided to call off the march after four civil rights leaders called for a moratorium on demonstrations until after the election in November. Roy Wilkins, national head of the N.A.A.C.P., was one of the four leaders.
