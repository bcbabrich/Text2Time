Scores of anti-Government demonstrators rallied tonight in University Square in the capital's center, the site of a 53-day demonstration that was violently broken up by the police in mid-June.

Protesters roped off the square and put up a sign declaring it a ''neo-Communist-free zone,'' as was the case during the previous demonstration.

The police later took down the ropes, leading to a scuffle between demonstrators and a man they suspected of being a police informer.
