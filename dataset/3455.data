So for America Online, the reasons to help Comcast fight AT&T are clear. If a combined America Online-Comcast succeeds in acquiring Mediaone, America Online will get a guaranteed channel for selling its services to consumers over cable modems. (Even if America Online does not end up participating in a bid for Mediaone, it will still get high-speed links to millions of homes through its deals with local Bell phone companies.)

The problem for America Online may be that Comcast needs cash. While Comcast's standing offer for Mediaone is all stock, AT&T has offered most of an AT&T share plus almost $31 in cash for each share of Mediaone. And in the largest syndicated financing to date, managed by Goldman, Sachs & Company and Chase Manhattan Bank, AT&T has already lined up $30 billion in commitments from lenders to back up its offer.

Comcast does not have that kind of financial firepower, and America Online may not either. At the end of the last quarter, America Online had only $1.8 billion in cash on hand. Even if it could raise a few billion more, it would still not be in AT&T's league.

One obvious solution for America Online would be to use its stock, which has given the company a market value of about $130 billion. But Mediaone's shareholders may have qualms about taking America Online shares, which trade at about 400 times estimated earnings. Valuations of that nature may not be sustainable, especially if America Online becomes part owner of a cable company, since cable companies are generally valued much more conservatively.

In addition, accepting a bundle of America Online and Comcast shares would not be wholly tax-free for Mediaone's shareholders -- although taking a mix of cash and AT&T stock would not be wholly tax-free either.

In some ways, Microsoft's position is the opposite of America Online's. Microsoft has almost $22 billion in cash on hand, but does not seem to have an obvious strategic reason to go to war against AT&T. Microsoft would like to sell software for high-speed Internet connections, but Microsoft and AT&T could find many mutually profitable ways to work together. Microsoft has invested $1 billion in Comcast, but that alone would not seem reason enough to make a strategic enemy of AT&T.

Mr. Allen may be the most intriguing candidate for Comcast. He has already invested heavily in the cable television industry, and he may not care about working with AT&T in the future.
