Another day, another set of insider trading charges — this time revolving around two buddies accused of illicitly trading in MedImmune.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Stephen R. Goldfield, a former hedge fund manager, with illegally making a $14 million profit from trading in MedImmune before its takeover by AstraZenca.

Also charged was James W. Self Jr., an executive at an unnamed pharmaceutical company accused of tipping off his friend Mr. Goldfield about MedImmune’s intentions to sell itself. Both men settled the charges.

According to the S.E.C.’s complaint, Mr. Self learned through his company that MedImmune was looking to sell itself — because his employer was thinking about making a bid. He then tipped Mr. Goldfield, a classmate at the the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, about MedImmune’s intentions.

Around April 2007, Mr. Self told Mr. Goldfield that the “weather was in the 50s,” a coded reference to his employer’s likelihood of making a bid for MedImmune in the $50-a-share range.

Mr. Goldfield subsequently bought 17,000 call options and 255,000 common shares in MedImmune.

AstraZeneca ultimately ended up buying MedImmune for $58 a share.

In their settlements, neither man admitted or denied guilt. Mr. Goldfield agreed to a permanent injunction by the S.E.C. and to pay $600,000 of a proposed $16.6 million in disgorged profits and interest. Mr. Self agreed to pay a $50,000 fine.
