"What do you need to live?" asked a note attached to a $25 contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "You need water and shelter and the basic thing you need is money. If you are rich you should give people who are poor some of your money. If you don't give people some of your money people will die of starvation. Would you like it if you died of starvation?"

The letter, written by 6-year-old Mark Weinberger of Newton, Mass., reflects the forthrightness of many of the youngest contributors to the Neediest Cases. In dozens of notes the children have managed to overcome all the social policy questions that divide the left from the right, Democrat from Republican, and they have boiled the issue of poverty down to a simple thought: Those with more should help those with less.

Many children said they had decided that a contribution to the Neediest Cases was the best gift they could give. "This year under the tree at the Burghs home, there will be no gifts from me," wrote 8-year-old Billy Adelson of Mamaroneck, N.Y., who together with his parents gave $100 to the Neediest Cases in the Burghs' name. "I will give them A BIG donation in their name to the needy just like I know they would. I know because they are nice to everyone."

Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor, and disabled. What began as the "Hundred Neediest Cases" has expanded to meet needs of thousands of individuals. Last year a record $4.4 million was raised from at least 15,580 individuals and organizations to help lessen the burdens of the city's sick, poor and disabled.
