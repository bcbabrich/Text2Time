WHEN I bought the country acreage I now call home, the road frontage to the west of the house was edged by a couple of wild cherry trees draped with poison ivy, a random specimen or two of multiflora rose, a few elderberry bushes and a thicket of sumac.

The neighbors counseled me to clear it out, a formidable chore that would have required the chain saw, heavy shears and hours of toil that I preferred to spend on other tasks that also needed doing.

Seventeen years later, the fencerow -- the growth is called a fencerow even though there is no fence there and never was -- has finally made it to the top of the end-of-season chore list. Given a reasonable period of time this year between the falling of the leaves and the falling of the snow, I will hack my way through the multiflora roses and elderberries, and gingerly remove the poison ivy vines.

The benefit of waiting is that I now know enough to leave the wild cherry trees alone (their fruit lures birds away from my blueberries), and to do nothing more to the sumac thicket than cut the wild brambles that threaten to obscure my view of it. What a mistake it would have been to clear out that sumac.
