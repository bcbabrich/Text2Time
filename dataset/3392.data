The money will be distributed in installments over 10 months, but only if Pakistan meets certain stringent conditions like increasing tax collections, reducing its budget deficit and privatizing public enterprises.

The loan has to be repaid in three to five years.

After its executive board approved the loan, the fund issued a statement on Wednesday evening in Washington, this morning Islamabad time, that carefully praised the government for its ''wide-ranging reform agenda'' and the progress it has made. But the fund also said Pakistan had a long way to go.

''Looking forward, continued improvement in revenue performance will be crucial for reducing the public debt burden and allowing more resources for tackling poverty on a lasting basis,'' the managing director of the fund, Horst Kohler, said in a statement. The fund dangled the possibility of a better deal in the future. If Pakistan puts its house in order, the fund would consider larger loans at a very low interest rate, 0.5 percent, fund officials said.

For years, Pakistan has posed a problem for international lenders, one that has become even more difficult since Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. Do the lenders continue to prop up an unstable country that has been run by a profligate and corrupt elite, that collects income taxes from 1 percent of its people and that has failed to tackle illiteracy and poverty?

The fund now appears to be trying to put Pakistan on a short leash in hopes that the government, unlike its predecessors, will follow through on its ambitious plans to discipline the economy. A year and a half ago, the fund stopped paying out on a loan after deciding that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, ousted in the coup in October 1999, was not fulfilling conditions he had agreed to.
