With Russian inflation running at 100 percent a year, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told a little joke about being forced to accept demands to be disclosed next week by the International Monetary Fund.

''A man is handed a letter from his wife,'' he said at the World Economic Forum. ''He opens it and the page is blank. 'How can that be?' he is asked. 'It's all right,' he replies. 'We don't talk.' ''

He had begged Al Gore to lean on the I.M.F. for repayment delay and new loans, and was turned down for good reason: the former spymaster has no economic plan to deal with congenital corruption beyond ''optimizing the prison population.''

But if Russia goes under, 30,000 nuclear missiles and the scientists and engineers behind them go on sale. The nation is not ''too big to fail'' (its population is smaller than Indonesia's, and is slumping toward half that of the U.S.), but the fallout from its collapse could be dangerous.
