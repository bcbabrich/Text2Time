Good tennis matches have ebb and flow. On Court 10, under gray skies and a stiff breeze, the Czech Tomas Berdych, the No. 12 seed, faces Florian Mayer, a German player, world No. 58.

Mayer is a slender 6-3. Berdych, at 6-5, has a improbable height advantage and a blistering serve in his favor. Berdych takes the first set, 6-1. But he drops the second, 3-6, and gives up a break in the third set at 2 all. He’s on the ropes.

Then the momentum shifts. Berdych’s entourage, courtside in the low stands across from his chair, barks encouragement and maybe some advice in Czech. Berdych stiffens, focuses. He suddenly breaks back, then runs out the set, 6-3. Now it’s Mayer who looks helpless, dejected, forced onto his heels point after point, unable to slug it out — or vary it up.

Untouchable on serve, Berdych misses chances in several games to force break points at 0-30 or 15-30. But it’s clearly a matter of when.

It happens at 2-2. At this point, Berdych blasts everything into the corners. When Mayer mounts a last charge, he’s behind 5-2. It’s too little, too late.

Afterward, he tells me he’s unable to beat Berdych when Berdych is on. From Federer down, the men are remarkably honest about themselves and each other. It’s true, Mayer says, he should have come to net sooner, but it would not have changed the outcome.

The arc of the match is classic drama. The winner’s triumph is heightened by his teetering on defeat. And, in Mayer’s case, vice versa.
