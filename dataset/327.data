In finding that nostalgia no longer sells, the Yankees have taken a new tack in the post-Jeter, post-Rivera, post-A-Rod days now that they have all but run out of jerseys to retire.

They are, instead, peddling tomorrow.

So, Gary Sanchez — whose Ruthian introduction to New York last season, when he hit 20 home runs faster than anyone in major league history, bought the youth movement some credibility — is trotted in front of the cameras during the winter while he slaps together sandwiches at a Bronx deli.

Then there is the farm system that Baseball America rated as the sport’s second best.

And last week, the Yankees feted some of those promising players when they celebrated the 2016 championship of their Class AAA affiliate, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, in style, with General Manager Brian Cashman handing out rings during a pregame ceremony.

When the Yankees shellacked Philadelphia, 14-1, on Thursday before heading up to Atlanta for their final exhibition game on Friday night, the team reminded everyone that its 24-8 record this spring (now 24-9) equaled the team’s most exhibition victories since it began keeping track of Grapefruit League games in 1962. Actually, the Yankees’ spring win total tied the mark they set in 2009 — which happens to be the last time they won the World Series.
