This week’s Sunday shows appear to be dominated by talk of those whose careers have ended over the past week, as well as of some trying to get the ultimate political promotion.

This week was a pretty good one for Senator Charles E. Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and he’ll be on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” to discuss it. The announcement by Senator John Warner, a popular Virginia Republican, that he will not seek re-election in 2008 gives the Democrats a better chance for a pickup in the Southern state that voted for a Democratic governor in 2005 and a Democratic senator in 2006. Mr. Schumer’s Republican counterpart, Senator John Ensign, will also be there, where he’s likely to be asked about Senator Larry Craig, who just announced his intent to resign. Fortunately for Mr. Ensign, Idaho is likely to stay in Republican hands in 2008 despite the scandal.

Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, will also be on “This Week” to talk about his Republican presidential campaign. The other presidential candidate on television tomorrow will be Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, who is set to appear on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” as is Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican. For even more presidential politics, NBC’s “Meet the Press” has a panel of all-star strategists: James Carville, Bob Shrum, Mary Matalin and Mike Murphy.



The other resignation that made big news this week was that of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He was in a near-constant battle with Congress over a slew of issues including the firings of federal prosecutors and warrantless wiretapping. Senators Patrick Leahy and Arlen Specter of the Judiciary Committee, two of the senators with whom Mr. Gonzales clashed the most, will appear on “Fox News Sunday.” Ed Gillespie, the White House counselor and former G.O.P. chairman, will be on hand to give the administration’s take.

Lanny Davis, former special counsel under President Bill Clinton, and Ben Ginsberg, former counsel to the Republican Party, are also likely to touch on Mr. Gonzales, as well as the Craig arrest on CNN’s “Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.” But much of the program will be devoted to Iraq and the upcoming progress report, with guests including Senator Richard Shelby, Representatives Kendrick Meek and Charles Boustany, Laith Kubba, a former Iraqi government spokeswoman and The Times’s own Michael R. Gordon, who has a lengthy magazine piece out on Iraq.
