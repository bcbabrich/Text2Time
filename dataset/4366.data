Application of the findings could prevent many thousands of crippling and disabling strokes among the 500,000 to 600,000 people who now suffer a stroke each year in the United States and could save thousands of lives among the 150,000 who die from strokes each year, said Dr. Michael D. Walker of the N.I.H. Of the three million Americans who have survived a stroke, more than two million have major disabilities, including paralysis, loss of speech and impaired memory.

Although the study's leaders expressed pride and excitement over the results, and presumably had one eye on the impact on next year's N.I.H. budget, they also said they were puzzled by some findings, particularly one showing that the operation was far less beneficial for women than for men. The risk reduction of surgery for women in the study was 16 percent as against 55 percent for men. The study's leaders said it would take additional research to solve the mystery.

Dr. James F. Toole of Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., who directed the study, learned of the results from a committee monitoring the safety of the study a few days ago. Acting partly on criteria set before the study began, the monitoring committee said that the study should be stopped prematurely "and physicians be advised immediately of its results." The study was carried out at 39 medical centers in the United States and Canada and entered patients from 1988 through 1992.

Today's hastily called news conference was part of the steps that Federal officials said they had begun to take to notify doctors and the public about the findings. But because the scientists wanted to publish results in a medical journal, they declined to answer many questions and to give many details beyond the overall results, a step that could lead to confusion for doctors who are consulted by patients about the study's findings.

The panel of N.I.H. officials and study leaders at the news conference also stressed that the operation should be done only by highly qualified vascular surgeons who had a proven rate of 3 percent or less for death and serious complications.
