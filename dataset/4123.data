There is a big difference between the World Cup soccer tournament, held last summer in the United States, and the Rangers-Panthers hockey game, held last night in Madison Square Garden.

The soccer games had more scoring and some of them were more entertaining. And the soccer tournament, the championship game at least, allowed for a shootout to settle a tie.

There was no such resolution when the Rangers and Panthers played to a 0-0 tie at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers outplayed the Panthers considerably, and they outshot them by 44-23.

Perhaps the play that best symbolized the game came in the third period, after Dave Lowry, Florida's gritty wing, gave away his stick to a defenseman who had lost his.
