Instead of treading cautiously around Rob Hodgson, Rutgers's slumping forward, the team went the opposite route during practice last week. Coach Kevin Bannon called him ''Robo Forward'' -- which he says irritates Hodgson -- and performed ''Robo Forward'' commercials. The swingman Jeff Greer said he told Hodgson, ''If you keep playing like that, we won't win one more game.''

Hodgson said his teammates' ribbing loosened him up. He wore his usual stoic expression throughout the Scarlet Knights' 87-61 victory over West Virginia today, but he must have been grinning inside.

Hodgson made all 11 of his shots, including six 3-pointers, and sank all three of his free throws to score a career-high 31 points, the most by a Rutgers player in a Big East game. He tied conference records and broke school records for field-goal percentage and 3-point percentage.

This was the same player who had stumbled through single-digit scoring performances in four of his last five games, culminating in a 6-point, 25 percent shooting night against Lafayette of the Patriot League last Monday.
