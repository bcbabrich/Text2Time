Orders to United States factories for manufactured goods fell six-tenths of 1 percent in May as a sharp drop in demand for aircraft offset strength in other areas.

The Commerce Department said today that factory orders declined $1.36 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $217.97 billion in May. It was the largest one-month decline since a 1.4 percent plunge last August.

Orders had been up sharply in the previous two months, rising by 1.5 percent in April and 1.6 percent in March. Analysts said the one-month breather would be good for the economy, giving factories more time to catch up with a backlog of unfilled orders. 'A Welcome Sign'

''Orders had been growing at an unsustainably high rate,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ''This is a welcome sign because it eases the pressure a bit on an industrial sector that is operating at close to full capacity.''
