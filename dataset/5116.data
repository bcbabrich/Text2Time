If the St. Louis Cardinals, as Whitey Herzog said, ''see Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson'' every night, the Mets must be facing Sandy Koufax and Juan Marichal all the time.

The Mets, who led the National League in runs scored last year and were supposed to have a more potent offense this season, have averaged only three runs a game the last four weeks. In their last 23 games before last night they had scored three runs or fewer 18 times. For the entire season that ratio was 30 in 48, matching the impotent offense of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the only team in the major leagues that has scored fewer runs than the Mets.

And Whitey Herzog complains that his team doesn't score runs.

''We've lost a lot of pitchers, but that hasn't been our problem,'' said Herzog, the Cardinals' manager. ''Our problem is we can't score runs. We got seven runs one game and the umpire gave us three of them because he missed a call. A lot of people aren't scoring runs, but we have all our people playing. Our starting eight are in there.''

Looking at the Mets' problems, Herzog pointed to the absence of Keith Hernandez and Gary Carter as possibly the primary reason. Carter's absence, in effect, began before his knee operation. His .114 batting average and five runs batted in had already labeled him as absent.
