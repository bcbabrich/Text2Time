"Some countries have only expressed sympathy and effectively taken no step to stop the suppression" of the rebellion, Teheran radio said. "This double standard demonstrates indifference to the plight of Iraqi civilians on the part of countries which have established human rights commissions ostensibly to defend civilians."

Asked today whether the commentary was aimed at the United States, Mr. Sarmadi said that it was.

Iran, which opposed both Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and the presence of United States forces in the region, is widely believed to have assisted the Shiite Muslim revolt in southern and central Iraq. But its official stance on Iraq's future leadership is that it will not interfere in the country's internal affairs, a position similar to that of the United States.

Asked why Washington should be blamed for taking a stance similar to Iran's, Mr. Sarmadi said that there were "fundamental differences" between Iran's relationship with Iraq and America's.

First, he said, Iran began establishing better relations with Iraq after its eight-year war.

"But U.S. forces are, in fact, at war with Iraq," he said. "Part of Iraqi territory is still under American occupation."

Moreover, he said, Iran had long been supplying humanitarian relief to the Iraqis; the United States has not. These conditions, coupled with the Bush Administration's call for Iraqis to rise up against their Government, led the Iraqi people to rebel.
