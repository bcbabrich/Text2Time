We also lived like nomads. Local Berbers built traditional tents that housed up to eight competitors between stages. There weren’t any toilets. We used plastic bags and peed in plain sight of one another.

How do runners prepare for the Marathon des Sables? I ran a lot, including the Badwater Cape Fear 51.4-mile race to get comfortable with sand running. I tested and retested my gear. I read race reports. I sweated in the sauna. And I trained my gut to become accustomed to dehydrated food: Every day for three months, I ate instant mashed potatoes after I ran.

It took almost no time to realize how ineffectively I had prepared for the Marathon des Sables.

I could feel the Sahara laughing at me. The mesh in my shoes let in fine sand, causing me to shake out large amounts every few miles. At the end of the first day, I begged at the medical tent for tape to cover the tops of my shoes. Before turning me away, one French doctor peered into my eyes and said, “I treat people, not shoes.” I noticed that people who complained of sore shoulders were receiving lots of tape. And so began my daily ritual of feigning shoulder pain to solve my shoe problem.

The first stage acclimated us to the desert and our living conditions. We also learned the race’s grave risks. To start the race, you have to show a race doctor an EKG that was taken within 30 days of the start of the race, and jeeps and helicopters were on standby to take people to nearby hospitals if needed. One man experienced cardiac arrest at a water checkpoint. His training partner howled in horror. The doctors revived him with CPR. His race was over, but he left with his life.

The next two days involved dozens of miles of climbing and descending sand dunes and mountains. When I reached the top of a rocky climb, I celebrated by giving one of my tent mates a high five. Ian Corless, a British photographer and founder of the Talk Ultra podcast, shot me a grin and said, “Get ready for the fun part.”
