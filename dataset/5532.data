Civilian doctors are soon to begin monitoring the quality of care delivered by military physicians, the first time such outside reviews have been conducted.

The decision to proceed with the review program was disclosed Thursday when the Defense Department awarded a $4.6 million contract to the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities, a nonprofit organization based in Ann Arbor, Mich.

The organization is to review each month the care delivered by doctors at 168 military hospitals worldwide. The program should be under way by April, the Pentagon said.

''I am convinced that the overall quality of care in military medicine is equal to, if not better than, care over all in the civilian sector despite a relatively small number of highly visible, tragic instances of medical mischance,'' said Dr. William E. Mayer, Assistant Secretary of Defense for health affairs. ''But the fact remains that there has been no precise way to compare quality of care.'' Reports of Substandard Practice
