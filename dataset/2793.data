Sex partners have the right to stop engaging in sexual activity at any time, a new state law says. The measure, sponsored by State Senator Dan Rutherford, a Republican, was prompted by a California case in which a woman engaging in sex told her partner she wanted to stop. He continued, and a court debated for years whether he had committed rape. Mr. Rutherford, who said state's laws were silent on the issue, wanted Illinois to take a clear stand. Jo Napolitano (NYT)
