Dave Checketts discussed the sympathy he had for Patrick Ewing's early-season discontent and restated his desire to see the Knicks' aging superstar retire with the team. But Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, could not assure a happy ending.

Ewing will be approaching 39 years old when his current deal ends in the summer of 2001. When asked today if the Knicks would extend Ewing's contract this summer, Checketts said he was focused on the team's effort to reach the finals and no decisions about the franchise center's future had been made. But Checketts did discuss how torturous the decision-making process concerning Ewing could become.

''We say we can't embrace him because either he won't embrace us or he's a private person; he doesn't let us in to what's happening or he hasn't won a championship,'' said Checketts, who joined the team this week on its West Coast trip. ''The fact is that whether he plays beyond his contract or not, Patrick will be one of the greatest to ever play in the N.B.A. So I don't know how it will end. Was it time for Dan Marino? Was it time for John Elway? Was it time for Michael Jordan?

Checketts discussed the state of the team today for one of the few times since he demoted General Manager Ernie Grunfeld last April. ''This is a team that has expectations,'' he said. ''They're not just created alone by me.''
