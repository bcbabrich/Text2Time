The debate on Wednesday between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his primary challenger Cynthia Nixon contained several moments of drama.

Ms. Nixon called Mr. Cuomo “corrupt” and hammered him over his handling of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which she said he used “like an A.T.M.”

Mr. Cuomo implored her to stop interrupting him. “I let you speak,” he said.

Ms. Nixon also repeatedly painted Mr. Cuomo as the tool of big-money donors. Mr. Cuomo responded by mentioning a series of requests Ms. Nixon made to friends at City Hall. Just look, he said, at “the teahouse for Sarah Jessica Parker.”

This wound up being one of the evening’s more confounding moments.
