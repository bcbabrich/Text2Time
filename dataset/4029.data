The race covered 137.85 miles, or 17 circuits of an 8.11-mile course through the upscale Buckhead section north of downtown. With the cloud cover and the 73-degree temperature making the 84 percent humidity almost tolerable, this was the fastest road race in Olympic history. The first two finishers were timed in 4 hours 53 minutes 56 seconds, an average speed of 28.1 miles an hour.

For a year, Armstrong had been saying that he would rather win the Olympic gold medal than the Tour de France. But bronchitis and a slight strep infection less than a month ago forced him out of the Tour de France and hurt his conditioning, and today he was a victim of the erratic tactics of the pack.

''Am I disappointed?'' he said. ''Yes and no. I have to be realistic. It's a long year and this is just a one-day race. People who expect wins every time don't know cycling.''

With typical bravado, Armstrong bolted to the front with 40 miles to go. ''I always feel like I need to give it a try,'' he said. ''That's what it's all about, taking risks. Some work and some do not.''

This one did not because Richard and Sorensen soon joined him. Although the three took turns in the lead to conserve strength, they never got more than 15 seconds ahead. The pack soon caught up. With 24 1/2 miles to go, Armstrong attacked again. He even saved a fraction of a second by cutting through a service station. But the big guns closed in, and with 19 miles to go, he was caught.
