Two teammates, his manager and general manager were among those who testified yesterday in Manhattan on behalf of Steve Howe in his arbitration hearing against major league baseball. The Yankee relief pitcher was permanently suspended last Wednesday for violating baseball's drug policy.

Although General Manager Gene Michael, Manager Buck Showalter, team captain Don Mattingly, catcher Matt Nokes and his wife, Kristy, were among those who spoke on behalf of Howe, no decision was reached. The hearing will resume Friday and arbitrator George Nicolau will probably not make a decision until next week.

Mattingly said he was asked what type of person he felt Howe was and how people reacted to him. Michael declined to discuss aspects of the hearing, but said about nine or 10 players attended as a show of support for Howe.
