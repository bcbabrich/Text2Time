Former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska could have chosen courage, boldness, guts or even lion-heartedness as a yardstick to compare the immigration stances of President Obama and Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona. But the former vice presidential candidate instead went with a much more pointed term on Sunday.

“Jan Brewer has the cojones that our president does not have to look out for all Americans, not just Arizonans, but all Americans in this desire of ours to secure our borders and allow legal immigration to help build this country,” Ms. Palin said on Fox News Sunday.

Ms. Palin attributed Governor Brewer’s nerve to the popular backing she has received and her continued strong support of a controversial Arizona law that was challenged in a lawsuit brought by the Obama administration. The law would have given local police officers broader authority to question people they stop about their immigration status, but that provision of it and others were derailed by a federal judge’s ruling the day before the law went into effect on July 29. Judge Susan R. Bolton of Federal District Court said a trial needed to be held on whether the provisions would interfere with federal authority on immigration and generate unwarranted scrutiny of legal residents.

The issue of immigration has emerged as increasingly important ahead of midterm elections in November, and Ms. Palin, a potential presidential contender in 2012, is not shying from the issue.

“I want to make sure that we have, especially in these historic mid-term elections, we have people elected — and I want to help them get there — to turn this country around and put it back on the right track,” she said.

Ms. Palin also took issue with President Obama’s proposal to end tax cuts for the wealthy that were enacted by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.

“His commitment to let previous tax cuts expire are going to lead to even fewer job opportunities for Americans because it’s the job creators who will be taxed,” she said. “The fewer dollars that they have to reinvest in their own businesses and hire more people, the worse it is for all Americans.”
