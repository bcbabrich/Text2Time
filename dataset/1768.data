In fermentation, enzymes produced by microorganisms (yeast, bacteria) transform complex molecules into simpler ones. The fact that beer is fermented might explain the proliferation of campus clubs celebrating this process. Friends of Fermentation started four years ago at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass. Each week a dozen students meet to make fermented foods like kimchi and sauerkraut. At left, they pick organic green beans at the campus farm that they will turn into pickled, spicy dilly beans.
