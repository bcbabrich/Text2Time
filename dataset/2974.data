Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum and a group of elected officials, labor leaders and government watchdogs called on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday to stop his attempt to revise the City Charter this year. Mr. Bloomberg has appointed a commission to study, and, he hopes, to propose eliminating partisan municipal elections and changing mayoral succession.

Perhaps coincidentally, a draft report on the succession issue, prepared by members of the mayor's law office, was given to reporters just before Ms. Gotbaum issued her statement in a news conference on the steps of City Hall. The report presents various succession possibilities for the commission to consider before submitting a proposal to voters in November.

Yesterday, Ms. Gotbaum and others cited timing, the Voting Rights Act and the hot weather as reasons that charter revision should not be undertaken this year, and they vowed to fight the effort.

''You cannot make fundamental changes in our democracy in 44 days,'' said Ms. Gotbaum, adding, ''If he does put these changes on the ballot, we will fight and we will win.''
