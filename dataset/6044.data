PHILADELPHIA, May 1 (AP) — The American Bar Association has turned two‐story row house in West Philadelphia into an experiment that could revolutionize the legal profession.

The building is the home of the A.B.A.'s first legal clinic. Robert T. Richards and a staff of two operate the clinic. They also advertise, despite the fact that advertising is still a controversial issue within the legal profession.

The 59th Street Legal Clinic is an 18month experiment that began last November to try to provide legal services to middle‐income people who make too much to qualify for free legal aid but do not make enough to afford an expensive lawyer.

“The clinic concept Is the most efficient way to provide legal services to the middle‐income people,” Mr. Richards said. “The poor have free legal aid. The rich people have the big law firms. But where does the guy who works go? The middleincome people have been greatly overlooked.”
