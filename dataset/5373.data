Canadian lumber industry executives today condemned an agreement that will set aside a 15 percent United States tariff penalty on Canadian softwood exports to the United States and replace it with a 15 percent Canadian export tax.

The executives were joined by politicians opposed to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government, which reached the agreement in Washington late Tuesday under the pressure of a midnight deadline set under United States trade law.

The agreement will apply to Canadian exports that captured 32 percent of the United States softwood market in 1985, at a value of about $2.9 billion.

Industry analysts here forecast that the new export tax will reverse a trend that has seen Canada widening its American market share in recent years, as layoffs and bankruptcies have increased in the United States softwood industry. American companies, contending that low fees in Canada for timber cutting amounted to an unfair subsidy, led the fight for a tariff penalty that resulted in a Commerce Department ruling that imposed the 15 percent import levy.
