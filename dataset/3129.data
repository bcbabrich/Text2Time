One day before today's deadline to enroll in the city's campaign finance program, 245 candidates had signed up, most of them running for City Council seats. City officials expect a record of at least 300 to enroll by the end of the day, although a final count may not be available until next week, as the candidates need only have requests in the mail by today. Candidates for mayor and other offices who participate in the program are generally entitled to $4 in city money for each $1 they raise in small contributions. The largest number of candidates to sign up for the 13-year-old program was 256 in 1991.
