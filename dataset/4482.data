A Montana paleontologist and his colleagues believe they have found red blood cells in the fossilized leg bone of a Tyrannosaurus rex and say they have high hopes of extracting DNA from the dinosaur's cells.

The discovery of the putative dinosaur blood cells has not yet been submitted to a scientific journal or independently confirmed but was reported two weeks ago by the National Science Foundation, which has financed the exploratory project. Jack Horner, a paleontologist at Montana State University who directed the investigation, said in an interview yesterday that his group hoped to find matches between gene fragments left in the preserved blood cells with comparable DNA segments from modern crocodiles or birds.

"If we're lucky enough to find matches," he said, "they could go a long way toward showing what the relationship between dinosaurs and birds might be. We're not there yet, but we think we're getting close."

The femur, or leg bone, that Mr. Horner's group is studying is part of an unusually well-preserved tyrannosaur fossil, more than 65 million years old, which they found and excavated from the Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana three years ago. The apparent blood cells were discovered by Mary Schweitzer, Mr. Horner's graduate student who was investigating the cell structure of fossilized bone and marrow tissue. New Climate of Belief
