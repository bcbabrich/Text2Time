WASHINGTON — During a week in which the United States Senate voted to relax Federal penalties for marijuana smoking for the first time in a generation by the astounding margin of 80 to 0, it might logically have been expected that the furor over the use of “pot” would have sub sided. But as legislators, police men and scientists have come to learn over the years, logic and marijuana don't mix.

The marijuana “week that was” started peacefully enough and for almost two hours hardly an incident of note was record ed throughout the nation. Then reporters in Philadelphia got wind at 1:55 A.M. last Sunday that John P. Cahill, 19, son of recently elected New Jersey Governor William T. Cahill, had just been released on bond after having been charged with pos session of one and one‐half ounces of marijuana.

Five minutes and three time zones later a flying squad of Pasadena police burst into a farewell party that had gone to pot. The party was being held by a group of space scientists from the Jet Propulsion Labor atory, a space agency facility run by Cal Tech. Twenty per sons, including seven scientists, were jailed for possession of marijuana and its more potent form, hashish.

Pasadena Episode

The local papers had a field day with that one. “Cops De orbit High Flying JPL Space men,” was a sample headline. The case (most charges were later dismissed) led one high of ficial at Space Agency headquar ters here to remark that the ar rests proved that “not all our people are square,” a reference to the widely held view that NASA people have the images of Boy Scouts. But the Pasadena episode was only a whiff of what to follow.
