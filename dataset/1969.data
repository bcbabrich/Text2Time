Mark Leckey, a multimedia artist whose exhibition “Industrial Light & Magic” combines recreated images of Felix the Cat, Homer Simpson and the movie “Titanic,” won the 2008 Turner Prize on Monday, the BBC reported. The annual prize, presented by the Tate Gallery in London to a British artist under the age of 50, comes with an award of about $37,000, and is often given to creators of untraditional and provocative works. Mr. Leckey, a professor of film studies at the Städelschule in Frankfurt, was presented with the prize by the rock musician Nick Cave at a ceremony. According to the judges, Mr. Leckey’s work “celebrates the imagination of the individual and our potential to inhabit, reclaim or animate an idea, a space or an object,” the BBC said.
