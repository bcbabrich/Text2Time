Favorite Room The living room of his rental house, which has green-gray walls and a Vladimir Kagan sofa where the Swedish-born clothing designer, who recently returned to his namesake brand, J. Lindeberg, does his best work. “I don’t like to sit behind a desk — it blocks my mind and my creativity,” Mr. Lindeberg said. “For me, a sofa is the center point.”

This room, with its dark walls and collection of skull masks, feels very masculine. Do you live alone? I think it feels French chic. But I separated from my partner a year and a half ago. I’d been living in SoHo for many years. I was kind of tired of traffic and people. I changed my environment, moved to Williamsburg. It’s a very calm street. I always like dark walls. It makes it somehow tighter and homier.

You’re known as a partygoer and a night owl. How much time do you actually spend at home? I actually changed in the last year. I used to be out a lot in New York. Since I moved here after a separation, I decided to spend a lot of time at home and think and ground myself and find inspiration on a new level. So the house has been very important to me the last year and a half.
