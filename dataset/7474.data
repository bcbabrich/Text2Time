BONN, July 31â€”West German military leaders forcefully rejected today a French plan to answer any Communist aggression with a massive nuclear attack.

Qualified sources stressed that the French idea to use nuclear arms from the start of hostilities ran counter to the principle of a graduated deterrent. This principle has been followed by the West German Government in line with the policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The French proposal was expounded in a recent article by Gen. Charles Ailleret, Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff.

In contrast with official expressions that there is unity among. the Western allies regarding the use of ground troops in Europe, there are experts who believe that France has taken herself out and is following an independent policy.
