Thailand's decision to send volunteer ground forces as well as gunboats and other military aid to Pnom penh may in the short run bolster the shaky Lon Nol regime and help to speed the promised withdrawal of American forces from Cambodia this month. In the long run, however, this latest extension of the Indo china conflict is more likely to add to the problems of the Cambodians—and the Thais—and to complicate the task of extricating American forces from South east Asia.

The Thai move is almost certain to provoke a reac tion from Communist forces already operating inside Thailand and along the long, porous Thai border with Laos. It could, in time, lead to a more substantial extension of the Indochina war to Thailand itself.

For the Cambodians this fresh promise of “help” from another traditional foe is at best a doubtful blessing even though it is accompanied by assurances that the helpers will all be Thais of Cambodian descent. The Thai move means a further intensification of the fighting on Cambodian soil, with all the destruction and loss of civilian life that entails. It will add weight to the nationalist appeal of ousted Prince Sihanouk who has alrerady gained recruits for his Communist backed fight to regain power as a result of South Vietnam's heavy‐handed intervention on behalf of the Lon Nol Government.

It could even lead to the dismemberment of Cam bodia, with the Thais indefinitely occupying western areas of the country, some of which they have long claimed; with the South Vietnamese taking over effec tive control in the southeastern region where their forces are operating, and with Communist forces hold ing firm in the northeast where they are entrenched.
