Assailants firebombed a partly constructed mosque here in southern Germany, the police said today. No one was injured in the attack, which took place late Wednesday, and damage was light.

Witnesses reported that several people in a dark car sped away from the scene shortly after the fire broke out, the police said. The police said they had no suspects.

The mosque, being constructed by the Turkish-Islamic Union, which is based in Cologne, was scheduled to be completed by summer.
