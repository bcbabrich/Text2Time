To the Editor:

That accomplished biographer and historian James T. Flexner may indeed be quite correct (Weekend, Feb. 13) in believing George Washington ''never kissed a baby.'' It is on record, however, that, at least once, this reserved Founding Father unbent enough to give a proferred youngster his blessing with a pat on the head.

In a Manhattan shop, when Washington Irving (1783-1859) was 6 years old, the family's Scottish maidservant saw the General and called attention to the boy, announcing, as an Irving biographer put it, ''Please your Honor, here's a bairn named after you.'' Washington responded cooperatively. This memory remained very clear to Washington Irving over a long lifetime as author, at the end of which he capped his career, so he felt, with a well-wrought, and well-received, biography of the by-then legendary first President.
