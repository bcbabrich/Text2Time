The shooting woke us up. A sow grizzly and her three large cubs had come into a camp and they were fighting over something in the yard, cuffing each other into the sides of the cabins. During the rest of the night, the guides did what they could to send them on their way but nothing worked. Only sunrise helped. The four seemed consumed by guilt from their all-night party. They slipped into the brush on the west side of the camp and moments later were racing over the round stones of the river bar on their way out of Dodge.

It was exhilarating. They had been around before and on a previous year had even chewed up the proprietor's airplane. This year, there were more than a few, dining on spawned-out salmon. It was an easy life on the verge of winter; but grizzlies did not require ease. If necessary, they would ascend the high, exposed scree slopes and snatch a mountain goat who thought he could safely watch the passing seasons in the valley below. It was rare for them to come into camp and it certainly gave a new piquancy to late trips to the outhouse.

But this was the British Columbia wilderness and anything that made its contrast stark to our everyday world, like the grizzly bear, the raven, the wolf or the eagle, was welcome. To the robust cubs backing around the cabins with garbage sacks and low growls, I wished to say, "Have at it."

I was here to fish for steelhead on one of the great angling rivers of the world, the Dean. It was my fourth trip and as always with anadromous fish that return to spawn, the question was whether or not the fish were in.
