Only the aloof Nurmi was unimpressed. He was a shy man who disliked the limelight, could not comprehend Americans' interest in records and was happiest with the countrymen he met in various cities.

Many of his records on this tour were at odd distances1¾ miles, 1⅞ miles, 2¼ miles —but there was one with which none quibbled—his 8:58.2 for two miles in a New York Athletic Club meeting at the old Madison Square Garden. It was the first time that distance had been run in under 9 minutes, and the mark stood until 1941.

He also ran the indoor mile at 4:12, a slow speed by to day's standards, but then it was dizzying, like his outdoor mile of 4:10.4 on a cinder track.

Nurmi's other feats included a series of races on successive nights, during which he established three world records in New York, another in Chicago and then a final one in New York. He was beaten, twice, most memorably in a 5,000‐meter race; but even as a loser he dominated the news.

In 1925 and afterward, Nurmi's financial dealings got him into trouble. He was accused of taking money under the table by submitting inflated expense accounts; and for this he was barred from 1932 Olympics at Los Angeles. He blamed his predicament on sports writers, who, he said, had disclosed his violations of the amateur code to the International Amateur Athletic Federation. The complaint was that many athletes received extra money, but that he alone had been caught.

Whatever the merits of the dispute, Nurmi was a hero in Finland, where a bronze statue of him running in the nude was put up outside the Helsinki Olympic Stadium, an uncommon tribute to even the greatest athletes. As late as last summer, tour groups were taken to the statue and told of the runner's accomplishment.

His beginnings were much humbler. The son of a carpenter, Paavo Johannes Nurmi was born in Turku on June 13, 1897. When he was 12, his father died. At 15 he went to support died. At 15 he went to work in a foundry to support his mother, brother and two sister. When he was 17 he began to develop his stamina and technique with solitary practice of 50 miles a week. This training, carried on through his active years, enabled him to reel off lap after lap inexorably and with graceful strides. He had learned the importance of steadiness in training by carrying a stop‐watch so that he could time each lap. Sometimes, in a race, he also carried the watch to time his laps.
