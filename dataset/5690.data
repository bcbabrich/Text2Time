Asked what Sir James was considering, the source replied ''To see if we would come in.'' The source, who asked not to be identified by name, declined to say how much money Sir James might invest or when he would decide, but added, ''It's a fairly active situation.''

Reports have been circulating for more than two weeks that Mr. Icahn was on the verge of attracting foreign money. Ten days ago, the Belzberg brothers of Canada agreed to invest almost $300 million in the deal. Now Sir James is said to be considering a $400 million outlay. Sir James operates through a number of foreign organizations, including one in Panama and another in Liechtenstein, but is known best in the United States as the controlling stockholder in the Grand Union supermarket chain.

Wall Street sources said that, if Sir James decided to invest, it would probably be in a new Icahn company being formed to buy Phillips, with Mr. Icahn also investing $400 million. Other investors would put up an additional $200 million.

Phillips Stock Up $1.375

The new development appeared to have reached Wall Street traders late in the day, with Phillips climbing $1.375, to $49.25, its first strong advance in more than a week. More than 1.6 million shares changed hands.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Icahn, who already owns 5 percent of Phillips's stock, told investors in a formal tender offer that if he could raise the money, he would pay $60 a share, in cash, for 70 million shares, or 45 percent of Phillips's shares outstanding. If successful, he would then have half the company at a cost of $4.2 billion. He said he would then buy the other half for $50 a share, in securities, for an average price of $55 a share.
