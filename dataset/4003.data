An ethnic Croat who fought for the Bosnian Serb army pleaded guilty today to crimes against humanity for his part in the massacre of thousands of Muslim men at a United Nations-designated "safe area" in Bosnia last July.

The soldier, Drazen Erdemovic, is the first person convicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal since it was set up in 1993. He will be sentenced in July.

Mr. Erdemovic, a rank-and-file soldier who has acknowledged his guilt from the start, was convicted for his part in the mass execution of thousands of Muslims in the enclave of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia last July.

With short dark hair and a pimply complexion, Mr. Erdemovic, 24, looked no more than a teen-ager as he stood before the court and described how his victims were killed in groups of 10, shot in the back by himself and fellow soldiers in the Bosnian Serb army.
