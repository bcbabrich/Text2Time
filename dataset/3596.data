To the Editor:

In his generous review of my book, ''Painting by Numbers: Komar and Melamid's Scientific Guide to Art'' (Jan. 4), Luc Sante suggests that the poll of American tastes in painting, which forms the basis of the whole project that the book engages, was a simple matter of artists' hiring telephone researchers to ring up some people with a few questions. This doesn't do justice to what was a formidable collaborative effort.

Chief among the collaborators was the Nation Institute, a nonprofit organization that raised all of the money for the American poll and contracted an established Boston firm, Marttila & Kiley, to conduct it. The pollsters then drafted the questionnaire in concert with the artists and some of us from the Nation Institute/Nation magazine offices; tested it in focus groups at the Manhattan Opinion Center; and hired the trained professionals who finally telephoned a representative sample of American households. A similar approach was taken by other firms in countries subsequently surveyed.

In other words, this poll -- statistically accurate within a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percent, at a 95 percent confidence level -- was no different in execution from any of the polls regularly used to determine the names of laundry detergent or, indeed, the direction of American foreign policy. As Alexander Melamid says in an interview in the book: ''We just were thinking about how this society works, and how the rulers in this society get in touch with the people, with real American people. How producers get in touch with consumers. In real life they take polls. . . . And this is a scientifically accurate poll, so if this poll is wrong, then all polls are wrong.''

One other small correction: the discussion of the project in which Dore Ashton and others from the art world participated, and which Sante cites, took place not at the Whitney Museum but at the School of Visual Arts.
