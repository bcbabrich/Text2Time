Dear Diary:

A memory from a long time ago: My friend and I were walking around the East Village at night. We were in high school. I think we were walking near Tompkins Square Park. A guy approached us and pulled something small and silver out of his jacket and flashed it at us and said, “Gimme all your money!” in a voice worthy of a cartoon villain.

My friend froze. We thought he had a gun. But then I looked down and saw that he actually had a small, travel-size hair dryer in his hand.

“That’s a hair dryer,” I said, stupidly. I think I was in a kind of shock. “What are you going to do? Get us with your ray gun?”

I don’t know why I said that. It still sounds like a dumb reply, even after all these years. In my defense, the hair dryer did look a little like a sci-fi prop.
