The Justice Department arrested the head of an Islamic charity in Illinois today and said there was extensive evidence that he and his organization had close ties to Osama bin Laden and had secretly funneled money to his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.

The man, Enaam M. Arnaout, 39, the Syrian-born director of the Benevolence International Foundation, was arrested at his home in the Chicago suburb of Justice and charged with lying under oath in documents his group had filed in federal court. The documents were part of a suit the group filed in January against the United States government after officials seized the foundation's assets as part of the investigations into the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.

In seeking to have a court unfreeze the assets, Mr. Arnaout testified that the foundation was a ''faith-based humanitarian organization that engages in charitable work around the world'' and ''does not engage in or fund terrorist activity.''

But in an affidavit given today by an F.B.I. agent to support its arrest warrant for Mr. Arnaout, the government provided an extraordinary amount of information it had collected, some of it dating back years before the Sept. 11 attacks, to support the accusation that the foundation was a front to finance terrorism around the world. The affidavit of Agent Robert Walker was rich in detail about the movement of money from the Islamic charities into what it said were the pockets of Al Qaeda operatives to pay for weapons and military training of terrorists in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia and Chechnya.
