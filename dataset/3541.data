Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Determine what an informed voter should know about all candidates prior to voting in an election.

2. Examine the current trend of 2000 Presidential election candidates incorporating their character into their campaign policies by reading and discussing “Candidates, Taking a Stand, Mix Policy and Persona.”

3. Categorize important information that one should know about Presidential candidates into headings commonly found on résumés.

4. Investigate, in pairs or small groups, information about an assigned Presidential candidate to be, included in a résumé for that candidate as determined by the class.

5. Create official-looking résumés for their Presidential hopefuls, including all research information conducted in the appropriate format.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-paper

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “Candidates, Taking a Stand, Mix Policy and Persona” (one per student)

-ten slips of paper, each with the name of one of the Presidential hopefuls (Gary Bauer, Bill Bradley, Patrick J. Buchanan, George W. Bush, Steve Forbes, Al Gore, Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes, John McCain, Donald Trump)

-hat or bag

-computers with Internet access (as many as available, preferably one per every pair of students)

-print resources with information on the 2000 Presidential candidates (newspapers, magazines, etc.)

-a variety of sample résumés (copied from résumé books) for students to use as guides to résumé layout and form

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following (written on the board prior to class): How does someone make the decision of which candidate in an election for whom he or she should vote? What are the different things that you would want to know about the candidates, if you were voting in the upcoming 2000 Presidential elections? (You may create a list.) Ask students to share their responses. Title a section of your blackboard “What We Want to Know,” and add students’ ideas as they share them.

2. As a class, read and discuss “Candidates, Taking a Stand, Mix Policy and Persona,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Read the first three paragraphs. Then, respond to the journalist’s questions posed in paragraph 3. What is the role of a candidate’s character when it comes to elections?

b. Why might Presidential candidates be developing and presenting “more meaty 10- and 12- point plans, earlier in the season, than ever before in Presidential politics”? What examples are offered in the article?

c. How do “the candidates’ handling of issues (reveal) their won approaches and personalities”? What examples are offered in the article? Why does personality matter in an election?

d. Why, according to the article, do many politicians present detailed plans early in the election process, particularly in this Presidential election?

e. How can presenting an overly-detailed plan lead people to feel that a politician is getting “tripped up in the minutiae”? How does this relate to some of the 2000 Presidential hopefuls?

f. How do political ads reflect a candidate’s character?

g. What examples from recent election history are given to support the statement that “candidates have to be mindful that voters do not always take detailed policy proposals at face value”? How does this affect the race for President, as supported by the article?

h. How do politicians attempt “to use substance to prove their own character”?

i. Do you agree with the statement that “the more candidates propose, the more they overpromise”? Why or why not? What does the last paragraph leave readers feeling and thinking?

3. Explain to students that they will each be working with a partner (or small group of three, if class size is larger than 20) to learn about a Presidential hopeful and then to write a résumé about him as if he were applying for the job of President. Refer back to the “What We Want to Know” list and add any necessary categories that relate directly to the organization of a résumé (such as objectives, special qualifications, previous jobs, and education). Then, determine where different items on the original list could be categorized, and create new résumé categories as necessary. Be sure to include a category or categories explaining the candidate’s positions on social security, crime, women’s issues, the economy, education and other important issues of the day.

4. Each pair or small group draws a slip of paper from a hat or bag with the name of the Presidential hopeful whom they will be researching. Using all available classroom resources, students should research the information that will need to be included in the résumé as determined on the board. It will be very helpful to students if they organize their notes into the categories determined by the class, each category on a separate sheet of paper. This way, their research will be organized fairly well when it is time for them to transfer the information into résumé form. The Internet will be students’ most valuable resource, as there is a vast array of good, accurate, easy-to-find information there. Suggest that students go to a search engine such as Yahoo! (//www.yahoo.com), AltaVista (//www.altavista.com) or another favorite search engine and type in the name of their candidate. All candidates have at least one Web site devoted to their background and platforms. Students can also find excellent information in newspapers and magazines, though this type of information search will probably take longer than searching through Web sites.

5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: After all research is complete, each pair or small group transfers their research into résumé format, developing an official-looking résumé for their Presidential hopeful. Display or hand out sample résumés for students to use as visual guides for the layout and form of their résumés. Résumés should be neatly typed and checked carefully for proper grammar and spelling. In a future class, each pair or small group should hand out copies of their Presidential hopeful’s résumé and present his qualifications and platform to the class for discussion. Students might also develop questions for further research on each candidate, for the groups to investigate as the campaign continues.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What personal qualities should every good leader possess?

–How do journalists often insert their own views into the news that they relay?

–What information about a candidate’s past do you think is important to know? What do you think is not important?

–What different methods do Americans use to determine which political candidate to support?

–What are some of the issues that are important topics of debate in recent American political history?

–Why do some people choose not to vote?

–What are various methods of political campaigning?

–What fundamental differences exist between the Democratic and Republican party platforms?

–What other political parties exist in the United States, and what are their fundamental political platforms?

–How do national and international events impact political elections and how people vote?

–How might a voter’s gender, religion, ethnicity, age, education, job, and region in which they live affect how he or she votes in an election?

–What responsibilities does the media have in presenting information about political candidates?

–What responsibilities do political candidates have in being honest to the media?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal response, participation in class discussions, thorough and accurate research of a Presidential candidate’s background and platforms, and thoughtfully- created résumé for this Presidential hopeful

Vocabulary:

persona, espousing, substance, attuned, elusive, pronouncements, intricacies, parlance, geniality, optimism, daunting, substantive, implicit, aura, subliminal, bona fides, partisans, accelerated, minutiae, ridiculed, remedy, mavens, deflect, integrity

Extension Activities:

1. Host a mock press conference or debate of Presidential candidates. Ask different students to represent different candidates, one student to act as the moderator, and the remaining students to act as the press. Each student representing the press should come prepared to the conference or the debate with a series of questions for candidates, and those acting as the candidates should be confident in their knowledge of their candidate’s background and platform on different issues. Stage the conference or debate for other classes in your grade or school, and then hold a mock election. Determine percentages of votes going to the different candidates and compare them with poll results as the electoral process continues. Interview voters as to how they voted and why, and write a news analysis of the process and results for your school newspaper.

2. Create a diagram of the electoral process in the race for the Presidency. You may want to locate and analyze a news article related to each step of the process. Additionally, the New York Times Learning Network offers a crossword puzzle titled The Electoral Process (//www.nytimes.com/learning/students/xwords/november99_1.html), which incorporates election process and history into its clues.

3. Choose a significant issue that surfaces in many, if not all, of the platforms of the 2000 Presidential election hopefuls. Create a comparison chart detailing where each candidate weighs on this issue. Then, examine how each candidate supports his views and write a position paper on your opinions of these platforms.

4. Develop an illustrated timeline of changes in voting law in the United States from the 19th century to today. How did different minority groups gain the right to vote, and what impact has their voice had on elections? What legislation has been developed to ensure the voting rights of all citizens? What legislation now exists regarding who may run for different offices?

5. Research the platforms of candidates in past Presidential elections and how these platforms reflected critical issues in the nation and the world at that time.

6. Create biographies or résumés for people who withdrew their candidacy for the 2000 Presidential elections. Where did these people stand on important issues? Why did they drop out of the election?

7. Examine your most recent local and/or state elections. What promises did candidates make regarding important issues on a local or state level? How are the elected candidates attempting to meet these needs? What has been the public reaction to these candidates now that they have been elected into office?

8. Use The New York Times to follow the campaign of a favorite Presidential hopeful. Create a scrapbook of articles, photos and related news items, analyzing the successes and failures of the candidate throughout the electoral process. The New York Times on the Web’s political campaign special index (//www.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/) provides articles and columns about the upcoming elections in 2000, plus maps, polls and links to campaign ads.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Locate and analyze the texts of historic speeches given by Presidential candidates. How would Americans view these candidates today?

Geography- Create a series of maps of the United States that relate to opinion and official polls for the 2000 Presidential election. You may want to color-code candidates or parties to clearly see where political sympathies lie. Then, examine why the people in different states may side with a particular candidate.

Global History- Research election laws, voting methods, political parties, and governments in other countries. Investigate the successes and obstacles of this year’s first democratic elections in many areas of the world, such as in Indonesia.

Journalism/Teaching with The Times- Explore how photographs that run in the newspaper affect one’s perception of a candidate’s character. The New York Times on the Web’s Photo Gallery: The Campaign Trail (//www.nytimes.com/library/photos/thecampaigntrail.html) offers the most recent photos of Presidential candidates with related articles. Be sure to also examine photographs from past and present elections in other countries. Create a collage of the pictures that you think best reflect the character of the candidates captured on film.

Mathematics- Graph opinion and official polls of Presidential candidates throughout the electoral process. What causes fluctuations in a candidate’s popularity? Who do you predict to win as each poll is released?

–Investigate and graph the campaign finances of some or all of the current Presidential hopefuls. Find the appropriate statistics on Web sites such as the Federal Election Commission (//www.fec.gov), Center For Public Integrity (//www.publicintegrity.org), Center for Responsive Politics (//www.opensecrets.org/home/index.asp), Public Disclosures Inc. (//www.tray.com) and Project Vote Smart (//www.vote-smart.org/). Include in your statistical research each candidate’s receipts (money raised), disbursements (money spent), cash on hand, top contributors and how much they each have contributed, business sector contribution totals and geographic totals (totals or percentages of money from different states or regions of the country). At the bottom of each graph created, write a paragraph analyzing what this graph indicates about this candidate and his campaign.

Media Studies- Evaluate Presidential campaign advertisements and how candidates both emphasize their views and attempt to point out what they feel are the “flaws” of their opponents. The New York Times on the Web has an extensive video collection of Presidential campaign commercials (//www.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/ads-index.html).
