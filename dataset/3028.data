The two fusspots and chocoholics became best friends. She dated others, he too. When she broke up with a boyfriend and was teary, he passed her tissues. They went to London, where they shared a room but slept in separate beds. She would try on a dress, ask him if she looked fat in it, and he would say it hung a little funny, and she would take it off.

''He became my girlfriend,'' Ms. Gilbert said.

He was also secretly and completely in love with her. Did it bother him that on Saturday nights she was out with other men? ''It bothered me a lot,'' said Mr. Egeth, a senior managing director for financial technology products at Bear, Stearns & Company.

After three years, she was single again, after ending a serious relationship, and Mr. Egeth pounced. They were talking at E J's Luncheonette on the Upper East Side. ''She was trying out who to fix me up with,'' Mr. Egeth said, ''and I said, 'How about you?' '' She thought he was joking. ''I proceeded to tell her I was in love with her for three years and intended to marry her,'' he said. She was speechless. Finally, she said: ''You are my best friend. I love you, but it's never going to happen.''

Did he slink away?

No. Each week, he sent her lilies, orchids, Ms. Gilbert said, with a note that read: ''You rock my boat. I love you.'' Obsessively, he began saving her messages on his answering machine.

His family and friends were alarmed. ''The longer the time elapsed, the more pain he felt,'' said Marc Devorsetz, a longtime Bear, Stearns colleague. ''Friends said, get over her,'' Mr. Egeth recalled. ''Move on. We have to deprogram you.''
