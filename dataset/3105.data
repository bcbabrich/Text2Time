As doctors expressed concern for the health of Emma Bonino, a leader of the small Radical Party who went on a hunger strike on Friday to protest insufficient news coverage of her party's top issues, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato asked TV networks to give more coverage to the party, which is anti-Vatican and argues that the abortion pill should be legal. Ms. Bonino, a former European Union human rights commissioner, has lost 7 pounds, 6 percent of her former weight of about 116 pounds. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
