This summer vacation season will be the first for Trek Travel, a division of the Trek Bicycle company that was launched last fall to operate cycling vacations in the United States, Canada and Europe. The trips use luxury hotels and restaurants and allow for different styles and levels of cycling. All participants are provided with the latest model of a road or hybrid Trek bicycle for use during the trip.

Besides bicycling, the trips offer a variety of other diversions, including wine tastings and tours guided by local historians.

A five-night visit to County Galway in Ireland exploring Connemara and the Aran Islands starting Aug. 31 is aimed at avid cyclists. The trips starting Aug. 24 and Sept. 14 offer an easier route. Ashford Castle, Ballynahinch Castle and Glenlo Abbey Hotel are among the hotels used; most meals, snacks and drinks are included. The cost is $2,975 a person without air fare, based on two people sharing a room.

Groups range from 6 to 20 participants, who must be 18 years or older; (866) 464-8735 or www.trektravel.com.
