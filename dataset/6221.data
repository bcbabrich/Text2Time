DETROIT, Dec. 31 (AP)— Mickey Redmond's 20th goal of the season earned the Detroit Red Wings a 4‐4 tie with the Minnesota North Stars in the National Hockey League tonight. It was the Wings’ third tie of the week.

Redmond's goal, at 6 minutes 23 seconds of the final period, gave the 25‐year‐old wing his fourth consecutive 20‐goal season in a six‐year career.

Gump’ Worlsey made his first start as goalie for Minnesota after 5½ weeks on the bench because of a pulled hamstring. He has lost only once this year in 10 games.

The Stars took an early lead on a goal by Danny Grant. But Detroit scored three straight goals in less than eight mintues to take a 3‐1 lead.
