Ancient nations like Wales are not anachronisms in the modern world, nor is loyalty to them a stubbornly irrational clinging to the past. Their persistence compels all of us to re-examine our ideas about political life.

To be a Welsh (or a Breton, or a Catalan) nationalist is to question the legitimacy of the state. When we recognize the legitimacy of a claim to sovereignty based on cultural realities, the right to a distinctive ''way of thought'' so eloquently described by Jan Morris, we see the modern state with quite different eyes: not as somehow given, inevitable or necessary, but as a human invention like any other, and as such, not inherently efficient or rational.
