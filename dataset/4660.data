Thanks in large part to the women's all-around gymnastics finals, NBC attained its highest Nielsen marks of the 1992 Summer Olympics on Thursday night with a 22.3 rating and a 40 share.

For the first five nights of competition, NBC is averaging a 19.9 rating, up 17 percent from the same period during 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. The share, a measure showing what percentage of televisions in use are tuned to the Olympics, stands at 36, 20 percent higher than the figure for the Seoul Games.
