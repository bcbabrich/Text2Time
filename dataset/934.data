SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — Have you ever gotten the feeling while solving that you are not so much cracking the code as successfully guessing?

That was the feeling I got while solving Gareth Bain’s puzzle, but that doesn’t mean that I didn’t enjoy it, nor does it mean that it was easy. It’s more a matter of seeing the patterns of certain letters and just knowing what goes in there. That happens in spots for me in most puzzles, but it has never happened throughout an entire puzzle like it did today. Maybe I’m just getting better at these things, or maybe it’s just a well-constructed and clued puzzle. I’m betting on the latter.

For example, I was able to fill in the entire southwest by just looking at the letters I’d already filled in and guessing at the blanks without even reading the clues: at 49 Across, I had R _ G G _ E and I knew it had to be REGGAE. Sure, it could have also been REGGIE, but I was in the zone, and was sure it was a musical clue. I don’t know how I knew, but that helped me get PATIENT where I’d had P _ T _ E N _, and CANNES just sort of fell into place. By then, I knew 56 Across had to be AVIATOR, but didn’t get the “Post, e.g.” clue until I looked it up and found Wiley POST.

Even so, I enjoyed the solve. There’s a lot of good stuff here: WIMOWEH (I’ll spare you the earworm,) APOLLO CREED, CAPITAL GAIN, TIMBALAND, and even the NORTH POLE standing up in the center of the grid. One small slap on the wrist to Dr. Bain for opening with PLAYTEX and closing with TEDDIES. For those of you who are still spinning your gears over it, this is what a PAWL looks like.

TORTOISES made me think of a news story I just heard about a pet tortoise named Manuela who had gotten lost at some point in the Almeida family’s life approximately 30 years ago, and when the family was cleaning out a locked room in the house, guess who they found sharing a box with an old record player? And, yes, it was alive.

Points to the youngish Dr. Bain for knowing APOLLO CREED, the fictional boxer from the “Rocky” movies. Here he is fighting character Ivan Drago, and welcomed into the ring by James Brown:
