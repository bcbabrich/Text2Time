Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050701friday.html (one per student)

-copies of journalist codes of ethics, found online at //www.asne.org/ideas/codes/codes.htm

-resources about journalism ethics and laws relating to journalism (civics and journalism textbooks, encyclopedias, computers with Internet access, etc.)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “The First Amendment of the United States Constitution states that ‘Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.’ What does this mean? What is the significance of a free press in a democratic society?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers. As a class, brainstorm a list of situations, actions or events where freedom of the press may be attacked or restricted due to other compelling interests. (The annotated text of the First Amendment is available from the FindLaw Web site at //caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/.)

Explain to students that they will now read an article about a current legal case in which two reporters, one for Time magazine and the other for The New York Times, are being legally compelled to turn over their notes regarding a confidential source. (Background information about the case involving Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller, known as the Valerie Plame investigation, can be found online at the Web site for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press at //www.rcfp.org/shields_and_subpoenas.html#plame.)

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050701friday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. What decision did Time magazine announce?

b. Why is it big news for a media organization to reveal a confidential source? What legal consequences are the two reporters facing?

c. Who is Norman Pearlstine, and why did he decide to hand in the documents?

d. According to the article, why is the case significant?

e. Why has the press “traditionally argued that it needs confidential sources”?

f. What is the position of Time’s reporter, Matthew Cooper, about Mr. Pearlstine’s decision? What documents are being handed over to the special prosecutor?

g. How might Mr. Pearlstine’s actions affect Mr. Cooper? How might it they affect the situation of Judith Miller, the New York Times reporter?

h. Who is Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and what is his position in the case?

i. What was the 1978 incident involving The New York Times? What position did the newspaper and reporter Myron Farber take in that case?

j. What does Zachary W. Carter mean by “civil disobedience”?

k. According to Mr. Carter and James C. Goodale, how are the risks taken by an individual reporter different from risks taken by a company?

l. What are the key points in this case? Who are the other reporters involved?

m. According to the article, what events in addition to the Plame case have created challenges for the news media?

3. Divide students into six groups. Provide each group with copies of codes of ethics from various media organizations, such as the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the National Press Photographers Association and the Radio-Television News Directors Association. Codes of ethics for these and other organizations can be found at //www.asne.org/ideas/codes/codes.htm. Explain that they will be briefly examining these codes of ethics to prepare for a fishbowl discussion on journalism ethics.

After a few minutes, ask students to share what elements stood out from these codes. Write key words and ideas on the board for reference.

Then, explain to the class that they will be participating in a “fishbowl” discussion on journalism ethics. First, ask students to number off one to five, and then keep a list on the board of all “1’s,” “2’s,” “3’s,” “4’s,” and “5’s.” Ask all “1’s” to sit facing one another in the middle of a circle created by the rest of the students. The students in the center are the only ones allowed to speak. If a student from the outer circle wants to add to the discussion, he or she moves to the middle of the circle, taps a participant to indicate that he or she should resume a place in the outer circle, and takes that student’s place as the new person in the discussion. After discussing the first question, switch the students in the center to all “2’s,” and allow the same fishbowl procedure to occur. Be sure to switch topics enough times so that all students have the opportunity to be in the center of the discussion at least once.

Questions to pose to students include:

-What is the role of the media in a democratic society?

-Jail is often viewed as a deterrent of crimes or a corrective measure to prevent repeated crimes. Is jail an appropriate punishment for a journalist who refuses to reveal sources? Why or why not?

-What are the dangers of limiting the freedoms journalists are entitled to when gathering information?

-Do individual reporters and media companies have similar or different responsibilities to readers? To the law? To company shareholders? To the ethics of their profession?

-Which is more important, the public’s right to know or the judicial system’s need for information? Why?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students write reaction papers responding to the following task, copied into a handout for easier student access: “Read the following statements, taken from the article read during class. Write a 1-2 page paper responding to one or more of the following quotations. In addition to commenting on this opinion, provide your own feelings about Time magazine’s decision to provide documents revealing confidential sources to a grand jury. Do you agree with this decision? Why or why not? Based on your reading and discussion in class, how might this decision affect the actions of journalists and media organizations in the short term and in the future? How might it affect you as a news consumer?”

QUOTATIONS

-Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time, Inc.: “‘I found myself really coming to the conclusion,’ he said, ‘that once the Supreme Court has spoken in a case involving national security and a grand jury, we are not above the law and we have to behave the way ordinary citizens do.'”

-Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The New York Times: “‘We are deeply disappointed by Time Inc.’s decision to deliver the subpoenaed records,’ he said. ‘We faced similar pressures in 1978 when both our reporter Myron Farber and The Times Company were held in contempt of court for refusing to provide the names of confidential sources. Mr. Farber served 40 days in jail and we were forced to pay significant fines.'”

-Zachary W. Carter, a former United States attorney in Brooklyn: “‘I don’t believe that a company has the right to put the assets of it shareholders at risk in an act of civil disobedience,’ he said. ‘On the other hand, the reporters are only faced with the consequences to them personally. They have the absolute right to put their liberty and fortunes at risk.'”

-James C. Goodale, a former general counsel of The Times Company and an authority on legal protections for reporters: “‘A public company must protect its assets even if that means going into contempt,’ he said. ‘It has an obligation under the First Amendment to protect those assets, and it’s in the interest of shareholders to protect those assets.'”

Students may share their response papers in a future class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Why might a reporter use an anonymous source?

-What other professions have ethical codes?

-How is an ethical code different from judicial laws?

-What characterizes fair and honest reporting?

-In the case of anonymous sources, is a journalist or media organization that refuses to reveal sources acting “above the law”?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on completion of initial journal responses, participation in class and group discussions, thoughtful participation in fishbowl discussion and well-explained response papers.

Vocabulary:

confidential, disclosure, covert, gravest, subpoena, precedent, scrutiny, credibility, bias, testify, substantial, counsel, contempt of court, incarceration, curare, acquitted, relinquished, obligations, divvied, civil disobedience, consequences, liberty, fortunes, beneficial, institutional, assets, fate, syndicated, operative, payback, nepotistic, boondoggle, presumably, scandals, chilling

Extension Activities:

1. Research and write a briefing paper outlining the Watergate scandal and the role journalism ethics played in the reporting about it. What stance did Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward take regarding their sources? What stance did their editor, Ben Bradlee, and their employer, The Washington Post, take? How did the Supreme Court respond?

2. Write a reaction paper examining why journalists, unlike other professionals, require a code of ethics that allows for the use of anonymous sources. Is there any other industry or field that legally uses anonymous sources?

3. Create a pamphlet explaining how to begin a career in journalism. What type of schooling or training is necessary? Where can a person gain experience? What options are there within the field of journalism? Who are some famous journalists in each field? Why are they notable?

4. Read “Red Light, Green Light: A Plea for Balance in Media Ethics” by Roy Peter Clark (//www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=82553&sid=32), paying close attention to his “Red Light” and “Green Light” ethics lists. Write a position paper either supporting or opposing Mr. Clark’s opinion about how current affairs have impacted journalism ethics. Besides agreeing or disagreeing, discuss the dangers of limiting (or not limiting) the media and work tactics of journalists.

5. The Supreme Court case Branzburg v. Hayes (1972) examines whether news reporters being required to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries constitutes an abridgement of the freedoms of speech and press as guaranteed by the First Amendment.

6. Conduct a debate on whether or not it is the responsibility of a news organization to protect its reporters in situations such as the one involving Mr. Cooper and Ms. Miller. Consider the stance of Time Inc., as well as The New York Times.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts – Create a poster illustrating the value of anonymous sources to American journalists.

Global History

-Research journalism ethics in various countries. Keep in mind that the type of government a nation has affects the way the media is run. Consider the media in non-democratic countries, such as Cuba, China, Vietnam, North Korea, Iran, the former Soviet Union, etc. Prepare a chart illustrating the names of the countries, types of government, number of legal media outlets, laws applicable to the media, etc.

-Prepare an oral presentation examining civil disobedience. What forms does it take? What famous acts of civil disobedience have occurred throughout world history? What impact did each event have?

Teaching with The Times

-Continue to read articles relating to the case against Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller. Clip headlines and key paragraphs and compile them into a news ethics journal. For each clipping, write a brief summary of the article and you reaction to the events in this story.

-Read and clip “The Ethicist” column by Randy Cohen in the Sunday New York Times Magazine for a month, and respond to Mr. Cohen about one or more of his decisions. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.

Technology – Create a Web site that explains basic journalism ethics and provides a list of Internet resources for further reference. Ask your school librarian to feature this site on your school’s Web site, if possible.
