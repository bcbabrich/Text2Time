Keeping 'He' in God

The latest battle over how much traditional religious language should change to accommodate modern sensibilities has been fought before the nation's Roman Catholic bishops.

Tradition won.

The bishops recently voted, for example, to stick with the version of Psalm 98 in the King James translation of the Bible that includes this verse:

"O sing unto the Lord a new song; for He hath done marvelous things: His right hand and His holy arm, hath gotten Him the victory."

In doing so, they rejected the updated version that went like this: "Sing a new song to the Lord who has worked wonders; whose right hand and holy arm have brought salvation."

The rejected changes were incorporated in "The Grail Psalter (Inclusive Language Version)," a revision that, in various forms, has been debated before the National Conference of Catholic Bishops for a decade but has never been authorized for use. A psalter is a translation of the Book of Psalms that is sung or read during church services. The new translation, written by a committee of scholars and translators, uses sex-neutral language, trying to avoid "He" for God or "man" for humanity.
