‘Terms of Endearment’

WHEN Opens Nov. 16 at 59E59 Theaters.

WHY “I was looking for a vehicle for the love of my life,” Dan Gordon said. He was romantically involved with Linda Gray when he first adapted the script from the 1983 film and Larry McMurtry novel it is based on. (Ms. Gray starred in its 2007 London premiere.)

“I also thought I could put the emphasis back where it belongs,” Mr. Gordon said. The screenwriter James L. Brooks “made it about how America treats cancer patients, which pulled things off the tracks. I focused on mothers and daughters and lovers and friends.”

CHANGES “I had no idea how to end the damn play and was thinking of abandoning the whole thing. I woke up at 2:30 in the morning, and my son, Zaki, who died when he was 22, was sitting on my bed. He said: ‘You’re stuck. It’s easy. Just call me.’ I woke up the next morning and wrote the last scene.”

CASTING Michael Parva, the director, said: “I was not trying to find a Shirley MacLaine, Jack Nicholson and Debra Winger. The play has to have its own identity.” Molly Ringwald takes the role that won Ms. MacLaine an Oscar.
