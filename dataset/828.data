WALLACH--Eli. The City College of New York mourns the passing of its distinguished alumnus, Eli Wallach, Class of 1938. Mr. Wallach earned a master's degree in education from City College and remained a supporter of his alma mater over the years. He gave to scholarships and the College's Annual Fund administered by The City College Fund. In 2010, the Alumni Association of The City College honored Mr. Wallach for his outstanding postgraduate achievements with its Townsend Harris Medal. To millions of fans, Mr. Wallach was a Hollywood legend who shared the screen with some of motion picture's biggest stars. To the City College, he was proudly one of ours. On behalf of our students, faculty and staff, sincerest condolences to the Wallach family. Lisa S. Coico, President
