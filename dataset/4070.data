Texas declared the football players MIKE ADAMS, BRYANT WESTBROOK, TRE THOMAS and CHRIS CARTER ineligible yesterday after learning that an agent had paid for their lunch during a weekend meeting.

The players will be held out of practices and tomorrow's game against Baylor unless the National Collegiate Athletic Association rules otherwise, Texas Coach JOHN MACKOVIC said. Athletic Director DeLOSS DODDS said he hoped to hear something from the N.C.A.A. by midday today. (AP)
