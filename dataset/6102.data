PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Sept. 30—The head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, Presiding Bishop John M. Allin, offered tonight to resign if his fellow bishops were unwilling to accept his outright opposition to ordaining women as priests.

Bishop Allin made his dramatic proposal in a speech to the opening session of the House of Bishops here. In the year, of turmoil and rancor since the Episcopal General Convention approved the ordination of women, the Presiding Bishop's effectiveness as a leader has been under growing criticism.

His offer to step down after serving four years of a 12‐year term came two weeks after 1,500 dissident Episcopalians who ardently oppose women's ordination met in St. Louis to form a breakaway churdh, provisionally called the Anglican Church in North America. Bishop Allin attended that meeting and was visibly shaken by the impending break.

In his speech here, he again declared his disapproval of admitting women to the priesthood, reflected ruefully on the sharp division over the issue, and asked his 150 fellow bishops to decide whether he was fit to carry on as the top official of the church.
