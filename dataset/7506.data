SAIGON, South Vietnam, Sept. 30 — The Government announced today that Lieut. Gen. Tran Thien Khiem, one of South Vietnam's three ruling generals, is to leave the country tomorrow. His departure apparently will remove one source of friction around Premier Nguyen Khanh.

At the same time, the Premier announced other changes aimed at answering the demands for high‐level reform.

General Khiem is to tour several countries that are providing aid to South Vietnam in the fight against the Vietcong insurgents, the Government announcement said.

The withdrawal of the powerful general was one of the demands reported to have been put to Premier Khanh by Buddhist leaders and the young group of military commanders who saved the Government during the abortive coup d'état of Sept. 13.
