Julius Erving of the 76ers has appealed a $7,500 fine for his role in a brawl with the Celtics Nov. 9 in Boston Garden.

Seventeen players were fined, and Larry Bird ($7,500) and M. L. Carr ($3,000) of the Celtics are the only others who have appealed. . . . Otis Armstrong , former running back for the Denver Broncos, pleaded guilty in Denver to fraudulently obtaining Percodan, a prescription pain reliever. He received a deferred judgment, and if he remains free of legal difficulties for a year, the case will be dismissed. Armstrong, who retired in 1983, said he needed the drug because of lingering pain from 17 upper-body fractures suffered during 7 years with the Broncos.
