We’ve counted up the entries in the Win A Trip contest, and we had a grand total of 3,797 entries in the Win-A-Trip contest. Hmmm. I must say, the contest seemed like a much better idea before the boxes of entries poured in.

My researcher, Winter Miller, has been poring over them — which means I’m not getting so much research these days — and we’ve narrowed it to a top 50 or so. For those of you who applied, good luck!

(By the way, I’d like to make this an annual event. But at the moment I think I’m going to add a line: The winner will be randomly selected.)
