“Manet and Modern Beauty” owes a lot to feminist scholarship on the artist over the last 30 years, and even the curators’ choice of walls of muted rose and dusky lilac signals their embrace of the “feminine” epithet that opponents of the late work once hurled. But there have always been many Manets, and even the later, tenderer Manet coexists with an artist of deep political engagement and historical sweep. The glaring absences in this exhibition — even more than the “Bar” — are Manet’s 1881 portrait of the exiled Communard Henri Rochefort, as well as his two late great seascapes, both titled “Rochefort’s Escape” and painted in 1880-81. As Mr. Allan writes in the catalog, Manet’s last years coincided with “an epochal political shift leftward” in France, and these maritime paintings with a political prisoner form the last act in Manet’s long interweaving of historical painterly styles and current events.

I suspect those works are not here so as to leave the last word to “Jeanne,” the Getty’s prize, who also appears on the catalog’s cover and on posters all over Chicago. May the gods of French painting forgive me, but “Jeanne” is a banal and overly refined picture, and its marriage of fashion and foliage tips exhibits a vulgarity wholly unlike the cool, careful “In the Conservatory.” The curators make hay from the fact that in 1882, visitors and critics at the Salon preferred the bright, pleasant “Jeanne” to the darker, stranger “Bar.” But I’m not sure why the same contemporary critics who slimed “Olympia” now get to have the definitive word on which Manets matter most.

I made three passes of “Manet and Modern Beauty,” and between the second and third I went upstairs to see the Art Institute’s most prized Manet: the pancake-flat “Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers,” which survived the outraged crowds of the 1865 Salon. Its blank background and disdain for illusion are miles away from the floral profusion of “Jeanne.” And I tried to shake my conviction that “Jesus Mocked” — a masterpiece of candor, so proud to be a two-dimensional slab of oil and canvas — counts for more than the fashionable scenes below.

Why do I value this early Manet so much more? It is only because I think art has a higher vocation than delivering joy?

Or is it because, poor modern boy that I am, I have been trained by more than a century of artists and writers to be suspicious of beauty — that ruse, that luxury, that feminine thing? The received history of modern Western painting, over which Manet looms like our great bourgeois Allfather, can feel like a succession of attacks on beauty by generations of arrogant men, each more certain than the last that their art would at last redeem an ugly society. But Manet knew that there is as much rebellion and insight in a dress, a bouquet or even a pile of strawberries if he could see past their surfaces to the richness within. That is another path to modernity, grounded in what his dear friend Baudelaire, in “The Painting of Modern Life,” called “beauty, fashion and happiness.”
