To the Editor:

Your Jan. 26 Week in Review article ''The (Not So) Neutrals of World War II,'' on the war records of Switzerland, Sweden and Portugal, does not mention that Sweden took in some Danish Jews.

Many of my Danish Jewish friends would not be alive today were it not for Swedish hospitality and generosity.
