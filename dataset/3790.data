Bud Selig, who has been called the acting commissioner by people in and out of baseball for four and a half years, is not the commissioner of Major League Baseball, a Federal judge ruled yesterday.

Judge Lewis Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan rendered that decision in rejecting the attempt of an owner of minor league baseball teams to block an arbitration that will determine the amount the Florida Marlins must pay for taking the territory of the Miami Miracle.

Marvin Goldklang, who owns the Miracle and is also a limited partner in the Yankees' ownership, had contended that proper procedure had not been followed in the appointment of a seven-man arbitration panel. He based his argument on the contention that Selig has, in reality, been the commissioner since Fay Vincent was ousted from the position in September 1992.

In a six-hour deposition taken Jan. 17, Selig said he was only chairman of the executive council, which served as commissioner in the absence of a commissioner and made all decisions.
