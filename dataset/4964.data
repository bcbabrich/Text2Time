Gertrud Michelson's ''When a Child Walks Away,'' [Opinion Page, June 10] evoked a sad nostalgia as I recalled a similar experience not many years after the author's.

I was a little older than Gertrud back in the 40's when I ''ran away'' - about 11 years of age. And my trip took me much farther - from Philadelphia to New York.

My mother was visiting her mother in New York and I became angry at my father who was home with my brother and me. I raided my bank (public transportation was very reasonable in those days!) and set off by trolley car (a natural means of transportation for an 11-year-old then) for Pennsylvania Station in Philadelphia. In looking back, I wonder why I was not questioned at the ticket window; I purchased my ticket and made the trip uneventfully to New York.

From there, it was just a non-threatening subway ride to 96th and Central Park West and a three-block walk to my grandmother's house - where I was welcomed by a near-hysterical mother and grandmother, because my father had called frantically to report my disappearance.
