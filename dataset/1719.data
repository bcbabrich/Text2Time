Like the porkchop on a stick and glad-handing presidential hopefuls, the exhibition of the butter cow is one of the great traditions of the Iowa State Fair.

This year, a butter likeness of Michael Jackson will be displayed alongside the cow during the fair in August. Sarah Pratt, who in 2006 became the fair’s official butter sculptor (only the fourth since 1911), told the Des Moines Register that her creation will feature the King of Pop in his famous “moonwalk” pose.
