More than 150 community leaders and residents of Manhattan's East Side, some pounding pots and pans and wearing gas masks, protested outside Consolidated Edison's power plant on East 14th Street yesterday and demanded that the utility make the plant environmentally safer before expanding it.

At the same time, in a related matter, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a news conference that unless electricity companies increase the amount of power they generate, New York could face an energy crisis like the one in California. ''We're about 350 to 400 megawatts short of where we should be for this summer,'' he said.

Con Edison plans to install new turbines at the East River plant on East 14th Street between Avenues C and D after the utility closes its Waterside steam plant on First Avenue between East 38th and East 40th Streets in Midtown. Last November, the company agreed to sell the land on which the Waterside plant sits to a developer for $680 million. The process could take several years.

Led by the East River Environmental Coalition, residents asked yesterday that Con Edison eliminate the use of diesel fuel at the East River plant and increase the size of its smoke stacks so that pollution from the plant could pass over the neighborhood, which some call Asthma Alley.
