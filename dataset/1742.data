Up until Monday night, the theme of this most recent season of “Weeds” seemed to be — to pick a non-judgmental word for it — oscillation. Each time we thought we had gotten comfortable with the show’s expansive cast of characters and what they were up to, their circumstances quickly changed — sometimes as soon as the very next episode.

Nancy started the season having learned she was pregnant with Esteban’s child; then the story line was accelerated nine months to the impending delivery of her baby. She thought she was Esteban’s prisoner; then she escaped home; then moved back in with Esteban. She was on the outs with Esteban — going so far as to put Andy’s name on the birth certificate of her child — then she and Esteban were married.

Andy was in love with Nancy; then he was in love with Audra, the abortion provider. She thought he was too immature for her; then she loved him too.

Celia was a hostage in Mexico; then she was selling cosmetics; now she’s the new Nancy.

On and on it went. And if it was ever unclear whether the “Weeds” writers knew where they wanted the show to end up this season, Monday’s finale very directly — and shockingly — suggested that yes, they did.

In the episode’s final scene, Nancy at last confronts Pilar, the villainous Mexican political boss who’s been secretly pulling the strings this season. Nancy’s plan to have Pilar killed (by Nancy’s long-ago drug associate, Guillermo) has failed, and Pilar ominously predicts that Nancy will spend the rest of her days as Esteban’s trophy wife, while making not-so-veiled threats against Nancy’s children.

Just when all seems lost, Pilar is — pow! — clocked on the head with a croquet mallet, driven face-down into a pool and to her presumable demise by an unlikely savior: Nancy’s son Shane, whose gradually desensitization to violence has been hinted at all season.

Since Showtime announced last year that there would be at least one more season of “Weeds” beyond this one, it was fair to expect that this just-concluded season would be an experimental one. (The fact that “Weeds” has generally been one of the channel’s most-watched and most-downloaded shows — Showtime says the series is averaging 3.8 million viewers a week when you factor in DVR and on-demand audiences — likely gave its writers even more latitude to play around this year.)
