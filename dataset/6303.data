To the Editor:

I very much regret that Wil liam Harlan Hale, in deploring such words as “tizzy” in my book “The Upper Crust” (which he reviewed in your Dec. 6 issue) did not see fit to cite a sentence on page 28, which be gins “[Alexander] Hamilton was a cool cat . . .”

Mr. Hale must have recoiled from this as violently as he did from other somewhat tongue in‐cheek phrases in “The Upper Crust.” But I must confess I enjoyed writing them all.
