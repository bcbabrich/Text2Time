Free Agency

Originally, the players said it was their key issue, and they demanded major reforms. Now, they seem ready to give up most of their requests for change and have agreed to modest alterations in the current formula, not all of them in their favor.

Group I players, who are under the age of 24 or have played fewer than five years professionally, would still be able to solicit offers from other teams. But the former team would have the right to match any offer, a new provision that favors the owners. If the teams don't agree on a transfer of players to replace the departed player, they submit proposals to an arbitrator, who decides, as has been the case in previous years.

Group II players, ages 24 to 30, could have more mobility than before because the compensation formula would be less harsh. Now, if a player wishes to change teams for a salary of $400,000 or more, his new team can be penalized by as many as five first-round draft choices. Under the new formula, compensation would be on a graduated scale, with no more than one first-round choice awarded for up to a $500,000 salary. More draft choices would be awarded as salaries go higher.

The age of Group III players will be lowered from 31 to 30, not the age 29 the players wanted. The original team can still match the offer, as is the case now. A slight improvement for the players. There is no player compensation involved with Group III players.
