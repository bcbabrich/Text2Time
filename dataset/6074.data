WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 — Severa prominent medical research institutions and Government hospitals in the United States and Canada were involved in secret, 25‐year, $25‐million effort by the Central Intelligence Agency to learn hovl to control the human mind.

The existence of the agency's investiga. tions into behavior and thought control was previously known. But through ac. cess to 2,000 C.I.A. documents and wideranging interviews, a group of New York Times reporters has developed new information about the cost of the program, the range of its penetration into prestigious research centers, the identities of some institutions, the secret funding conduits of the agency and the concerns about the program expressed by some scientists.

The original research was spurred by the conviction‐later proved unfounded ‐that the Russians and Chinese had developed brainwashing and mind‐control devices. But the C.I.A. quickly turned to seeking an offensive use for behavior control. It sought to crack the mental defenses of enemy agents‐to be able to program them and its own operatives to carry out any mission even against their will and “against such fundamental laws of nature as self‐preservation.”

Three Foundations Used

It channeled funds through three ,private medical research foundations. One of these, the Geschikter Foundation for Medical Research in Washington, D.O.; is still active. Another, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology Inc.. was disbanded in 1965. A third named in one report was the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, also active, but Dr. John'W. Bowers, director of the foundation, said there was no indication it had been a conduit for C.I.A. funding.
