Paul Horgan, the Pulitzer Prize man of letters whose September novel, “White water” has already made him a man of $250,000, is mark ing the start of his 64th year with a display of literary versatility.

Not only is the writer in residence at Wesleyan Uni versity in Middletown, Conn., publishing a major novel about two boys growing up in West Texas in the nine teen‐forties, but he is also putting out “The Heroic Triad,” which he calls “a very serious book” on the American Southwest. And then there is “a very, very serious book“—”Maurice Bar ing Restored.”

Leaving his hot typewriter in Connecticut for a cold luncheon in New York the other day, Mr. Horgan ex pressed the customary pleas ure over the advances for “Whitewater.” “But,” he said with a tweedy smile, “I think my other two books are quite important.”

‘The Heroic Triad’ is ter ribly timely,” he continued after jabbing at a shrimp. “It contains essays on three cultures along the Rio Grande —the Indian, the Spanish and the Mexican‐American — and it may do well because all those people are fighting for their rights these days. This book, in a way, follows “The Great River,” for which I got a Pulitzer in 1955.
