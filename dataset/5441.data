The two Pioneer spacecraft traveling far beyond the known planets have failed to find any evidence to support speculation that a 10th planet is out there somewhere, but that does not necessarily settle the matter, a space scientist reported yesterday.

If there is a large planet toward the edge of the Solar System, said the scientist, John Anderson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it must be traveling in an elongated orbit nearly at a right angle to the orbits of the other planets. Such an orbit would bring the planet near the rest of the Solar System only every 700 to 1,000 years, he said.

Dr. Anderson described this new hypothesis for the possible existence of what some astronomers have called Planet X at a news conference at the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. The center is directing the flights of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft, which are more than four billion miles out from the Sun on courses taking them eventually into interstellar space. Planetary Puzzle

Astronomers have long searched for Planet X to account for puzzling observations showing perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. These wobbles indicated that some large, distant object was exerting a gravitational tug on the known outer planets. The search led in 1930 to the discovery of Pluto, but it was found to be too small to be disturbing the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.
