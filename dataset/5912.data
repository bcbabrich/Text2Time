Some fans may think that the saturation point may have been reached with the arrival of the United States Football League this year, but there is more professional football on the way. And the backers of the new league say they are serious.

Yesterday, plans were announced for the 12-team International Football League to begin operations next spring in New York, Chicago, Florida, Hawaii, Houston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, the San Francisco Bay area and Tennessee. The league, which will be in direct competition with the U.S.F.L., does not have a television commitment, but is negotiating with NBC and with the USA cable network, according to Jerry Saperstein, a vice president at Madison Square Garden, who would operate the New York franchise with Richard Stein, an attorney. NBC, through a spokesman, Kevin Monaghan, confirmed that there had been ''preliminary discussions'' last week. USA officials also confirmed talks and said future discussions were a possibility.

''We wouldn't be here if we didn't think we had a chance to be on national or cable television,'' said Dennis Murphy, a league vice president who helped found the American Basketball Association, the World Hockey Association and World Team Tennis. ''Perhaps in time, good sense might bring about a merger with the U.S.F.L.''

''We'll compete with the U.S.F.L. for free agents and guys who don't make it in the National Football League,'' said Ray Malavasi, the former coach of the Los Angeles Rams, and a consultant to the league, who said that he expected to coach one of the teams in California. ''And we can offer an opportunity to kids who don't like sitting on N.F.L. benches.''
