The League of Women Voters of Connecticut would like to comment on statements made in two recent articles on resource recovery:

Peter Villano stated in his article, ''Resource Recovery: The Facts for Both Sides'' [ Opinion, Dec. 28 ] : ''Those who tout recycling as an alternative to incineration are only fooling themsleves and the public. It won't work. There is just so much -no more than 20 percent of the total -that you can profitably separate from the waste stream.''

Responsible proponents of recycling do not suggest that all waste can be recycled; simply that the recycling of reusable waste materials can significantly reduce the amount of waste that must be disposed of by incineration or other means. Recycling can and does work, and 20 percent is significant.

Until such time as waste-to-engergy facilities are available to all communities in the state, a 20 percent reduction in the waste stream can prolong the life of a landfill, and, as municipal landfills reach capacity, can result in valuable savings in tipping costs at alternate sites.

According to Betsy Percoski's article ''Bonds Issued, State Draws Closer to Trash-to-Energy System'' [ Jan. 11 ] , the City of Norwalk may soon pay up to $13,500 a day to dump its trash at a landfill in New Milford. Communities throughout the state can tell similar stories. The sale of the recycled municipal trash, even at current low prices, can help offset the cost of separating and hauling it. When trash is simply dumped, there is no recovery of the cost of hauling and dumping.
