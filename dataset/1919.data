The Japanese teenager Kei Nishikori took out two top seeds on his way to the fourth round, but couldn’t get past a third Monday, falling to No. 17 Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.

Initially, it appeared Nishikori would continue the kind of play that propelled him past fourth-seeded David Ferrer two nights earlier. Over the first three games, he fired blistering forehand winners to both corners of the court seemingly at will, racing out to a 3-0 lead. Del Potro seemed flustered and frustrated, blowing two of his three instant replay challenges on back-to-back points.

But then the magic seemed to vanish from Nishikori’s racquet. Del Potro held his own serve and then was able to break back. From there on, he was not seriously challenged in that set (or, for that matter, the match) as Del Potro was able to control points with his solid ground strokes, and feast on Nishikori’s errors.

It’s not that Nishikori didn’t have chances. Through the second and third sets, he was able to break Del Potro’s serve. The problem was he couldn’t hold his own serve, and was broken a total of seven times in the match — not a winning formula.

Del Potro will next face Andy Murray, the No. 6 seed, in the quarterfinals after Murray dismissed Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets Monday night, 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.
