The authorities arrested about 20 ministers who carried wooden crosses as they marched to police headquarters in the capital, Harare, to protest laws restricting freedom of assembly. Under the laws, approved by Parliament last year, citizens must get permission from the police before holding public meetings. The ministers said intelligence officers recently harassed a congregation that was listening to testimony from victims of political violence. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
