Rush Limbaugh said Friday that doctors found nothing wrong with his heart or arteries, but that the cause of chest pains that sent him to a hospital in Hawaii on Wednesday was unknown.

At a news conference at Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu, Mr. Limbaugh, the influential conservative radio host, said doctors had performed tests and “found absolutely nothing. It was a blessing.”

He continued, “The pain was real, and they don’t know what caused it.”

Mr. Limbaugh, who was vacationing in Hawaii, was rushed to the hospital after experiencing a sharp pain in his chest at around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday. He stayed in the hospital until Friday for observation.

Asked if he was still taking painkillers, Mr. Limbaugh replied flatly, “No.” In 2003, he acknowledged an addiction to painkillers and entered a rehabilitation center.

According to a statement from Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicates Mr. Limbaugh’s show, he plans to return to his radio show “sometime next week, after some rest, but will make appearances with fill-in hosts in the early part of the week.”
