Even as summer starts to melt into fall, thousands of landscapers and exterminators throughout the region continue to spread, spray and squirt an ocean of potent pesticides every day. Whether they use a hose to wipe out grubs on a sprawling bluegrass lawn or a slender wand to surprise pests in the hidey-holes of a house, applicators are expected to be state certified and trained to handle chemicals safely.

But environmental groups say that the training and testing of applicators is far from adequate, and that inexperienced workers pose a danger to residents, workers and, in some cases, themselves.

While the pest control industry says mistakes are relatively rare, some serious accidents involving pesticides have raised concerns about current laws:

The owner of an exotic bird shop in Queens went out of business in January after most of her 400 macaws, cockatoos and parrots died after pesticides were sprayed at the McDonald's restaurant next door by an improperly certified exterminator.

More than 35 people at a girls' softball game in Moreau, N.Y., were taken to a local hospital in 2001 after the teenage son of a local landscaper mistakenly sprayed an insecticide for mosquitoes while the game was still being played. The teenager did not have the proper certification.
