Police and fire investigators today safely removed an assortment of bomb-making materials, including 250 pounds of the type of fertilizer used in the Oklahoma City bombing, from a Pacific Gas and Electric Company service center here and took a company employee into custody.

A police spokesman, Sherman Ackerson, said the employee, 44, who works out of the service center in the Mission district, told investigators about a storage site a few blocks away, where they found more bomb-making materials. The materials were removed, but Officer Ackerson would not identify them. The man's home was also searched, but Officer Ackerson said he did not know the results of that search.

The police did not release the suspect's name.

''He obviously has a lot of charges hanging over his head,'' Officer Ackerson said. ''But we cannot speculate as to why he was in possession of these materials.''

The police had no other suspects, he said.

The chemicals found at the service center included five 50-pound bags of ammonium nitrate -- the commonly available fertilizer that was combined with fuel oil to make the 4,800-pound bomb that killed 168 people in the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995 -- and a 33-gallon drum of calcium nitrate. At least one book about bomb-making was also found, Officer Ackerson said.
