The hearing on the nomination of John G. Tower to be Secretary of Defense took an unexpected turn today when witnesses and senators were drawn into a public discussion of allegations of womanizing and drunkenness against the him.

A witness, Paul M. Weyrich, testified that he had seen Mr. Tower drunk and in the company of women other than his wife. Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee questioned Mr. Weyrich further in a closed hearing and said afterward that the former Senate staff member who is now lobbyist for conservative causes failed to provide specifics to support his accusations.

But Mr. Weyrich's testimony forced the committee to continue its scrutiny of Mr. Tower, even though the accusations did not appear to be a serious threat to his confirmation.

Mr. Weyrich did not say when he had seen the former Texas Senator with women or whether Mr. Tower, twice divorced, was married at the time. Mr. Weyrich, who had asked to appear today before the committee to oppose the nomination, said he thought Mr. Tower lacked the ''moral character'' to be Secretary of Defense. Tower Declines Comment
