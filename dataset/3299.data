Aetna Inc. and the ING Group, the Dutch financial services company, said yesterday that they were discussing a new offer from ING to buy Aetna's financial and international divisions. Aetna declined to discuss the price under negotiation, but some Wall Street traders estimated it could be as high as $9 billion, only slightly less than the roughly $10 billion ING had offered for all of Aetna earlier this year.

Aetna shares rose $5 at midday after CNBC reported the ING offer, and closed up $4.0625 at $66.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

William H. Donaldson, chief executive of Aetna, said his company was ''working with ING on their new proposal concerning our financial services and international businesses.'' He added that Aetna was still committed to improving its Aetna U.S. Healthcare unit, the nation's largest health insurer. ING said in a statement that Aetna's ''domestic U.S. health care operations are not part of these negotiations.''

Mr. Donaldson said there were ''no assurances'' that the ING deal would close or what the terms would be.
