State Senate majority leader Ralph J. Marino two months ago came to Washington for a fund-raiser at the Capitol Hill Club. He went back to Albany with between $50,000 and $80,000, State Senator Guy J. Velella said in a telephone interview. Mr. Velella is the chairman of the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee.

If anything, the amount donated last year was smaller than the year before, when the battle for control of the Senate was coming to a head. In the weeks leading up to the election, Federal records show Representative James H. Scheuer, a veteran Douglaston Democrat, donated $18,500 to the state Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. Representative Gary L. Ackerman, another Queens Democrat, loaned the committee $15,000.

But the declared donations were only the tip of Washington's financial iceberg. Many representatives convinced friends and contributors to arrange fund-raisers, members of the Congressional delegation said. Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat, said he helped raise $30,000 for the State Senate Democratic Committee. Since he had not given the money himself, he was not required to report it. While the Legislature appeared to protect Mr. Solarz's district, the plan created by the court could force him to run against another incumbent.

The flood of donations spurred by redistricting provides an unusual glimpse into one of the lesser known paths used to channel contributions and underlines how money, and access to money, has usurped many of the political parties' functions. Traditionally, most Federal lawmakers came to Washington after spending years climbing the party structure, giving them a broad base of support in the statehouse.

But the parties' declining influence has cut many of those ties. And a decade of domestic budget cuts has reduced the number of opportunities for Federal lawmakers to make themselves appear irreplaceable by grabbing slices of the Federal bacon. This has forced representatives to come up with new ways of winning statehouse friends and influence. Role Reversal

The result has been an inversion in members' traditional roles, especially in states losing Congressional seats, like New York, which must cut three districts. Where representatives are accustomed to lobbyists courting them with perks and contributions, the redistricting process has turned members into supplicants.

The impact of their donations remains unclear. Mr. Solarz and several other members from both sides of the aisle said they have concluded the money was not a wise investment since Democrats failed to gain a Senate majority and legislative deadlock for the moment has put redistricting before the courts. "We now have state judges, Federal judges deciding. I hope they don't ask for contributions," Representative Fish joked.
