About 20 pounds of metal debris fell over Valley Stream, L.I., late Wednesday night when an engine on a Trans World Airlines 747 jetliner disintegrated in midair shortly after the craft took off for Rome.

The plane returned to Kennedy Interna‐. tional Airport. There were no injuries reported on the ground or on board the plane, which carried 222 passengers and 15 crew members.

Windows were broken in some stores in the Green Acres shopping center.

On Ash Lane, a residential cul‐de‐sac two blocks south of Sunrise Highway, families turned out to collect shrapnel in shoeboxes, which were then turned over to police. Residents reported that pieces of metal as large as two feet in diameter had fallen on roofs and yards and had broken some windshields. “It's lucky it happened so late, because a lot of kids play in this street,” Paul Wolff said. “We are getting out of this area and moving west. The odds will eventually be against us that there will be crash.”

A spokesman for Trans World Airlines yesterday denied early reports that the engine had exploded. “There was some failure in the internal mechanism of the engine that has yet to be determined,” he said. “If the pilot had elected, he could have headed off to Rome with the cut‐off engine (one of four), but it was easier to fly back.” He said the plane made a routine landing after dumping 30,000 pounds of aviation fuel over the ocean.
