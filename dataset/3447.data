Ms. Goldsmith is 45, one of nine children -- three of them in the cleaning game. Married, with an 8-year-old daughter, she lives in Blue Point, N.Y., the town where she grew up, and commutes from Long Island in a 1994 Ford Explorer. Her hair is cropped short, and the day we met, her imposing build was modestly adorned in jeans and a tweed blazer over a black T-shirt. A faint tinkling sound followed in her wake. This turned out to be the Mexican chime she has worn around her neck, along with a crystal pendant, since being treated for breast cancer last year.

As she barked appraisals, I stammered apologies. (I'm neat, not clean.) I told her she didn't have to do my laundry, and I couldn't afford more than one assistant.

What time did the freight elevator start running, she wanted to know. She would be bringing equipment. The job would take her eight or nine hours, she figured. (I pay my weekly cleaning lady $60 for half that time)

Last year, one New York client refused to pay. ''He thought I was $150 a day for five people, and he stiffed me for $4,500,'' she said. ''Which has never ever happened.'' I promised to pay, and she showed up at 8:30 the next morning, loaded down with gear: a six-foot ladder, her Electrolux vacuum and five shopping bags filled with rags, towels and her own cleaning products.

''I don't believe in a wax buildup,'' she said, speaking of the evils of spray furniture polishes. ''We're killing everything!'' Ms. Goldsmith's father was a builder. Her mother was an early convert to holistic living: composting, health food. That, plus the cancer, has made her extremely eco-conscious. She uses chemicals when she has to, like the heavy-duty grout cleaner from the hardware store, but her all-purpose cleanser, Bi-O-Kleen, is made with grapefruit seed and orange peel extracts.

Murphy Oil Soap is out, not for chemical reasons, but because she thinks it doesn't work on wood floors, despite the devotion to this product among New York housekeepers. ''It leaves a film,'' she said. ''You can only use it on unfinished wood.'' For floors and almost every other surface, she uses One Wipes, an oil-treated yellow cloth she buys by the crate from a supplier in Wisconsin. (No waxy buildup, she says.) She will use Q-Tips on corners and hinges, and dust delicate objects with a paintbrush. Her biggest cleaning secret: soap and water. And plenty of that bygone commodity called elbow grease.

When I left for work, she was pulling down and dusting books by the handful. ''This is an hour,'' she said flatly, digging into my floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Lenka Bondo, her 24-year-old assistant from the Czech Republic, was sitting on the floor of my bedroom closet, folding. I realized I forgot to hide the ''joke'' underwear someone gave me for my birthday last year. There are no secrets from Ms. Goldsmith and her crew. ''People get embarrassed,'' she said. ''I say: 'Don't worry about it. I'm not perfect.' ''
