Mr. Diehl appeared as a knight in shining armor in the accounts of the decision to get tough. But local environmentalists say a dose of political jousting probably also played a role.

Complaints about the chimney, which has stood since well before World War II, started rolling in about 11 years ago, when the politically powerful Association of Polish Cooperatives decided to build a 10-story office building across from the smokestack. When employees of the cooperative open their windows wide, they get a desk full of soot, even though some are about 150 feet from the chimney.

Even more important, the factory lies several hundred yards from the Polish Army medical academy, which trains doctors for the elite military hospitals that treat Communist Party functionaries.

Stefan Samborski, deputy director of Delta and the villain to opponents of the smokestack, explained wearily that the company's management could not have installed the chimney filters even if it had wanted to.

''Four, five years ago we installed cyclones to clean the smoke,'' he said in a conversation at Delta headquarters. ''In the first period, the cyclones functioned well. But they do not eliminate the sulfur. But the means are not at our disposal to resolve the problem.'' A Lack of Western Currency

That, he explained, is because Poland does not produce the scrubbers the chimney needs, and the only ones available are made by a West German-Brazilian company that sells them for convertible Western currency.

Convertible currency purchases for any equipment can only be made through a central ministry in Warsaw. Delta has repeatedly requested such purchases, Mr. Samborski said, but the ministry has responded that because Poland is so heavily indebted, it does not have the required cash.
