The program's computer system manages all patient searches, tracks detailed patient histories and maintains the four-million-member registry. At any time, it is processing searches for more than 3,000 patients. The donor program communicates online daily with 350 to 400 groups around the country, including hospitals, community groups and donor centers.

In transplant centers, Mr. Shepherd said, new online tools provided by the program shorten the time it takes to search national and international registries to find matches. In some cases, the search for a potential unrelated stem-cell donor that used to take a day can now be done in seconds.

There are dozens of independent bone-marrow and related registries worldwide, and they do not share all their information. Most, but not all, do share the basic tissue data for the more than 6.4 million people worldwide who have given samples; it is forwarded to Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide, in Leiden, the Netherlands. That group's Web site, www.bmdw.org, is open to doctors and the public, and includes technical data, information about how to become a marrow donor, extensive links to more information about the procedure and cancer treatment, and information on donor registries worldwide.

''It's not updated as often as some of us would like,'' said Dr. Dennis L. Confer, the chief medical officer for the National Marrow Donor Program. The international registry updates its list monthly. For information other than the basic tissue types, doctors have to write, phone or send faxes or e-mail to the individual registries, Dr. Confer said.

''More and more, the ability to access donors through online communications is going to become the norm,'' he said.

Pamela J. Weisdorf, director of the program's office of patient advocacy, said its Web site was being redesigned for user-friendliness with the help of a 12-member advisory group, including patients and their family members. ''They want information about their disease,'' sometimes even before they know they need a transplant, she said. ''One of the other things they tell us is, 'Please, you have to put things into language we can understand.' ''

There is also a difference between Web language and medical language. Take the word ''search,'' Ms. Weisdorf said. It means one thing to most Internet users, but to patients facing a life-or-death deadline, it means searching for an unrelated-donor match.
