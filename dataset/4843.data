Numbers like those may force the Eagles to acquire another quarterback. "We have to consider that on the way home tonight," Kotite said. "We don't think Jim's injury is season-ending, but we don't know. It's possible we'll bring in another one, and we'll zero in on that more."

Washington completed its dominating night with Chip Lohmiller's 35-yard field goal in the third quarter, a 27-yarder in the fourth quarter and Earnest Byner's 7-yard run on a sprint draw in the final quarter.

The victory was Washington's ninth in the last 12 regular-season meetings with Philadelphia, and sixth in the last seven over all against the Eagles, including the 20-6 playoff victory in Philadelphia last season.

The Redskins missed a chance to score on their first possession, but their defense continually gave their offense good field position. That persistence helped Washington build a 10-0 halftime lead.

The half would not end, however, without several unusual twists and turns. With 1:39 remaining, Green intercepted a Ryan pass and returned it to the Philadelphia 28. One play and 12 seconds later, Rypien, under pressure, was apparently intercepted while trying to throw the ball away. His low toss to the left sideline was scooped up by linebacker Byron Evans, who sped to the Washington 28. But replay officials reversed the call, saying Evans had trapped the ball. This One Counted

On the next play, Rypien again was intercepted, and this time no replay was needed. His pass bounced off receiver Gary Clark's right shoulder and into linebacker Seth Joyner's hands at the Philadelphia 34. But the Eagles' offense labored, forcing Philadelphia to punt, and Washington left the half unscathed.

Clark had beaten Allen on a 75-yard pass play on Washington's first possession. From the Washington 18, Rypien threw the ball 45 yards but short of Clark, who had been speeding down the left sideline. Clark slowed down to make the catch while Allen's momentum prevented him from staying close. Clark raced to his right, across the field and was finally tackled by cornerback Izel Jenkins at the 7. Three plays later, Allen redeemed himself by intercepting a Rypien pass in the end zone, this time stepping in front of Clark to make the play.
