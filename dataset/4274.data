Hugh Rodham's supporters in Miami had been promising that he would be a fresh face in Florida politics. But even they might not have realized just how fresh.

The voting records of the Dade County Supervisor of Elections Office show that Mr. Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, who began his bid this week for the Democratic nomination to the United States Senate, registered to vote in the state only in December 1991 -- in time to cast a ballot for his brother-in-law, Bill Clinton, in the 1992 Presidential race.

Even though Mr. Rodham had been a Dade County resident and government employee for 13 years, he had not registered before that, according to records examined in Miami today by the New York Times Regional Newspapers. He said he did not remember ever voting for President or state offices before 1992 because he was part of the "lethargy and apathy that presented itself in the 60's and 70's" and that he has now awakened to "the chance to change in the 90's." 'Didn't See the Need for It'

That would mean that Mr. Rodham, the assistant public defender in Dade County who has said of his potential Republican opponent, Senator Connie Mack, that "there should be a hue and cry throughout the land for his scalp," did not vote against Mr. Mack when the conservative Republican ran for Senate in 1988.
