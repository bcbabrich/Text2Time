Readers respond to David Brooks’s Dec. 1 column, “The Age of Skepticism“:

Maureen Scott, Kansas City, Mo.: I feel obligated to respond to the following portion of your latest column in the context of the Great Depression: “As the Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman has observed, Americans begin social reforms when they are feeling confident, not when they are weary and insecure.”

At the depths of the Depression, social reforms took priority . . . To say that the nation was feeling confident at that time would be a misnomer. It took the overwhelming will of a strong leader, Roosevelt, to keep on message about the positive nature of our nation to set reforms in motion.

What we lack right now, as a nation, is a strong leader who we can rally around. I see no such persons in our political parties that are ready to step up to this challenge, to overcome partisan politics and do what is necessary for the future of this nation. THAT is what makes me weary and insecure. We need another Lincoln to overcome the divides and remind us what this country was founded upon.

Ted Brown, San Francisco: Your essay today provides an interesting bookend to your piece on the unappreciated heroism of our troops.

The common theme in both, it seems to me, is one I’ve seen in a lot of political writing in the past 10 years. In different ways, for instance, both E.J. Dionne and Christopher Lasch have discussed the retreat of Americans from responsibilities outside of their own property lines, their own private circle of concerns. Is it any wonder that the exurbs are a popular, attractive residence destinations for millions of Americans? A place where the evils of the world, like poverty and disease and war, are kept at bay, or at least vicariously experienced through violent video games, a place where personal dreams and ambitions are fostered without much care for civic or patriotic sentiments and habits.

What should our government do given these circumstances? I think, in part, this willed personal isolation explains the appeal of current conservative politics to so many Americans — the idea that governance is somehow a problem, not an essential part and positive good of any civilization. In a subtle way, it’s an easy step to see civic obligations and patriotic sacrifice as part of the evils of government. After all, don’t such sensibilities force us to connect with our political institutions? And this is why this administration has failed in its leadership it has neither asked nor inspired the majority of Americans to commit to the war on terrorism, or in day-to-day terms, to drive an economy car instead of an S.U.V. because we need to save our resources to win this war.

Michael Koplow, Woburn, Mass.: It is not as bad as you suggest. It is a question of leadership in this country, and as you well know but seldom state, our leaders in Washington under this administration are woefully unqualified to manage the country’s affairs.

Why not state the obvious reason for such skepticism in the U.S. the incompetence of the current administration. If we get capable leadership, the public’s skepticism will evaporate.

Paul Corning, San Francisco: One of the most significant social changes in my lifetime happened with the transition to Ronald Reagan’s presidency.

If I remember correctly, it happened not at a time when Americans were feeling confident, but at a point of near despair over our economy and our power in the world. Reagan’s reforms pale in comparison to FDR’s, which were larger and were attempted during far more difficult times.

It is pain and fear that encourages us to change. Unfortunately, we probably have a lot of both ahead before we get serious about change.

Steven Campbell, Oakland, Calif.: While I agree with Mr. Brooks that we are living in a time when the American people view their government with equal measures of skepticism and cynicism, I am once again disturbed by his unwillingness to put much of the blame where it belongs — the Republican Party.

While I agree that the Democratic Party is far from blameless, the Republicans have practically made cynicism their political strategy. After 9/11, President Bush had the opportunity to put his money where his mouth was and actually be the uniter he claimed to be. Unfortunately, he instead squandered national unity and resolve on partisan political goals, putting party before country.

When politicians clear cut trees in the name of healthy forests, or weaken air pollution controls and call it clear skies, is it any wonder that the American people are cynical?

Tim Potter, Oceanside Calif.: You are right on the money when you say that the American public is skeptical about the U.S. government’s ability, especially this Bush administration, to ‘solve the deep problems that are rooted in history and culture.’

This skepticism was cured on Vietnam and Watergate. I disagree that it leads or will lead to passivity. If a person is let down enough by a situation, or others, long enough, they figure out eventually that they can not rely on that situation or persons, and that they need to take matters into their own hands. The most successful people throughout history have not waited for anyone to give them permission to realize their dreams.

I submit that what is happening now is a new awakening, where people are seeing behind the veil of illusion that government as it is now solves our problems, initiates change or meaningfully effect our lives.

Albert Sayers, Pound Ridge N.Y.: There is one component you missed in your essay about cynicism and that is honesty. I have heard you over and over again say that how we got into the war is over and how we are going to go forward is what matters and so let’s go.

Yes, We need to move forward. But people understand when they have been deceived and that is how they feel now. They know there were no W.M.D.’s, especially nuclear ones that scared us all to death. They know the occupation was bungled but they hear the administration saying the insurgents are in their last throes. If the administration did not lie about W.M.D. and it was the intelligence that was bad, they want to know why the president gave the head of the C.I.A. a medal! . . . It just does not add up.

On Sunday Sen. Warner said the president should have a fireside chat like Roosevelt did. What made those chats work is that when he told you what was going to happen and why the facts unfolded to support his statements. That builds trust. Misleading the people leads to cynicism.

Lastly, when you treat people who disagree with you . . . with contempt you are in fact saying you have contempt for the system that gives them their voice in the first place. . .
