Parliament elected Prime Minister Turgut Ozal President today for a seven-year term, opening the way for a change of government under a new Prime Minister he will select.

In a session boycotted by all 155 opposition members of Parliament, 263 deputies from Mr. Ozal's governing Motherland Party voted for him.

Fethi Celikbas, the only other candidate and a member of Mr. Ozal's party, received 14 votes.

Mr. Ozal, 62 years old, was elected on the third ballot, after failing to muster the required two-thirds majority of 300 votes in the first two ballots on Oct. 20 and 24. A simple majority was sufficient on the third ballot.

Mr. Ozal became Turkey's first civilian President since 1960 and the first Prime Minister to move up to the highly respected but largely ceremonial post. He takes over from President Kenan Evren when his term expires Nov. 9.
