Far From the Crowd, 'A Failed Recluse'

Mr. Clarke acknowledges the paradoxof having chosen a distant home and then craving approbation from afar. ''I fear I am a failed recluse,'' he says.

But he also insists that praise, like futurology, be reality-based. Paging through a new fax from an admirer suggesting that ''3001'' has confirmed him as the greatest science fiction writer of all time, he furrows his brow and motions to a sepia-tinged photograph above his desk. ''Forgive me,'' he says, ''but wasn't there a fellow called H. G. Wells?''

Already ''3001,'' the fourth novel in the series (the others are ''2010'' and ''2061''), shows signs of becoming the greatest success of Mr. Clarke, who has more than 70 million copies of his novels and short stories in print. The book, No. 5 on the New York Times best-seller list, is selling strongly in Britain and a score of other countries and is being translated into more than a dozen languages.

To hear Mr. Clarke tell it, the main reason he stirred himself to write a new novel more than a decade after ''2061'' was the advance of as much as $2 million from his American publisher, Del Rey/Ballantine Books. The figure, said to have set a new benchmark for science fiction, does not include payment for a movie version that is under discussion, possibly again with Mr. Kubrick.

''They waved a lot of greenbacks at me until my eyes glazed over,'' Mr. Clarke says.

He can certainly find uses for the money. In addition to the house in Colombo, he maintains a holiday villa down the coast, at least nine secretaries and valets here and in England, and a Sri Lankan family that has lived with him for many years, caring for him in ill health and overseeing the scuba-diving company they own with him. Friends say Mr. Clarke suffered major financial losses in the 1980's when he left his affairs to an associate in New York.

Still, it is clear from spending time with Mr. Clarke that something besides money -- something linked to residing far from the world that nurtured him -- helped him break the promise to stop writing that he made to himself in the early 1990's.

After publishing articles and stories almost nonstop since his first science-fiction efforts appeared in his school magazine in his native Dorset in the early 1930's, Mr. Clarke had come to see writing as a form of imprisonment. ''When you're writing, you're not living, and I wanted to live,'' he says.
