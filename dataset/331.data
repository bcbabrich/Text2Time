It has become one of the knottier puzzles on Wall Street.

As political risks have increased at home and abroad, complacency among investors has rarely been so widespread.

This trend, which began soon after President Trump’s victory in November, culminated on Monday, when the VIX index, known widely as Wall Street’s fear gauge, dipped briefly below 10 — the first time it had done so in more than 10 years, in the months before the financial crisis.

The VIX measures investor expectations that stock markets will move sharply up or down.

On Tuesday, the VIX turned up, to close at about 10.6 — but still sharply lower than its historical average of roughly 20. At current levels, the VIX reflects a striking sense among investors that the persistent rise in stocks would continue, regardless of election fears in Europe and concerns here that Mr. Trump might not deliver on his ambitious economic agenda.

“The pricing of risk is at near historic lows, and the pricing of the stock market is at near historic highs,” said Julian Emanuel, a stock and derivatives specialist at the investment bank UBS. “And all of this at a time when political risk is very elevated — at home and abroad.”
