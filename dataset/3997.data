He said a speech to the players on Thursday by General Manager Bryan Murray best summed up his own thoughts. Murray thanked them for a distinguished season and added, "It's not over yet."

Then Vanbiesbrouck noted wryly, "Maybe he had that speech then so he didn't have to have it tomorrow."

If Murray thought it might be a farewell address, he apparently did not have much company. A growing number of the Panthers seem to believe they are a team of destiny, even as a third-year expansion team.

"I'll believe in destiny a lot more if we win Game 7," Bill Lindsay said.

Defenseman Terry Carkner was blunt in his assessment of the final game. "I think Pittsburgh's a better team," he said. "But that doesn't mean we can't win."

That's because, Tom Fitzgerald said, the Panthers have seen the value of all-out persistence.

"We're a team that believes in each other," he said. "I remember early in the season we were down, 6-1 or 6-2, to Pittsburgh and we never quit. We wound up losing by a goal and we came close to taking the thing into overtime."
