Season 4, Episode 12: ‘A Roy Rogers in Franconia’

We have not always been kind in this space to Paige Jennings, or to Holly Taylor, the 18-year-old Canadian actress who plays her. When “The Americans” was balancing its Paige story line (teenager finds out her parents are Soviet spies) with its Martha story line (woman finds out her husband is a Soviet spy), we were solidly on Team Martha — her plot won on dramatic and emotional grounds and Alison Wright acted up a storm as the lonely secretary willing to commit treason for love. (Even if her lover was actually Paige’s bigamous father.)

But Wednesday night’s episode, “A Roy Rogers in Franconia” (written by the showrunners, Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields), forced a reconsideration. Not a total one — we still miss the exiled Martha desperately. But Mr. Weisberg and Mr. Fields, through sheer persistence and a radical but deftly handled twist at the end of last week’s episode, have managed to make Paige’s between-two-worlds predicament interesting. We finally care about what happens to her, and what’s in her head, rather than just seeing her as a hyperventilating nuisance who’s putting her parents in danger. And while Ms. Taylor’s range remains narrow, it feels as if the character’s evolution toward a kind of resigned fatalism, or exasperation, has been cleverly tailored.

The episode started in the aftermath of last week’s random violence, when Elizabeth stuck a knife in the neck of a would-be mugger in front of Paige. At home — where Philip and Henry were happily playing a game of Stargate on the ubiquitous family computer — Paige demanded answers. Was the man dead? Did her mom have to do that? How did she know how to do it? And, most tellingly, had she done it before? Paige’s parents have denied hurting people — which we know is ludicrous — and now Elizabeth had to roll back one more lie, perhaps the biggest one of all. She admitted that she had killed before, but added, “To protect myself, yeah,” which seemed arguable. (Though it’s always for the protection of Mother Russia.)

The next morning Paige was still digesting what she’d seen, and getting a new sense of how dangerous her parents’ work must be, if they were trained to do what her mother had done. She was no longer talking about calling the police; she was just trying to adjust her picture of her mother and father to all this new information, and insisting on getting even more.
