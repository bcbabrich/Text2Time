LET us accept Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's contention that she was completely uninvolved in the presidential pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive commodities trader accused of tax evasion. Ditto the former president's decision to reduce the sentences of four Hasidic men from New Square, N.Y., who were convicted of defrauding the government.

The facts argue for a more cynical interpretation, since Mr. Rich's former wife, Denise, is a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who pleaded her ex's case to Bill Clinton. She is so generous that she even gave the Clintons more than $7,000 worth of furniture for their new homes. And New Square, in Rockland County, is the only Hasidic community in the state (each votes as a bloc) to overwhelmingly support Mrs. Clinton. Then, after the election, Mrs. Clinton attended a White House meeting between the men's supporters and her husband; Mr. Clinton subsequently commuted the original sentences of 30 to 78 months to terms of 24 to 30 months.

So the facts do seem to undermine Mrs. Clinton's assertions of disinterest, but even if she was indeed above the fray, even politically na√Øve, she still has a problem -- a big one. That problem is one of perception. It sure looks as if the junior senator has benefited from a quid pro quo, and she has done little to dispel that dangerous impression.

Politics has its own ethic and language, and Mr. Clinton's leniency has given those of us on the outside a big fat glimpse of how things really work. The world of New York politics, especially on the Democratic side, is abuzz about the pardons, the senator and her presumed role.
