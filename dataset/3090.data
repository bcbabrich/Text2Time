AN annual expedition race since 1995, ''Eco-Challenge'' is not new to television - but the edition that begins tonight is almost certain to be viewed in an all-new light. It is the first time ''Eco-Challenge'' has ever been the show from the man who brought you ''Survivor.''

Mark Burnett, who created the race and the television show and has produced all editions of ''Eco-Challenge,'' knows the association will make a difference in how the latest ''Eco-Challenge,'' is perceived. He did, after all, alter the fate of one network, CBS, and the nature of prime-time competition last summer and this winter with the first two seasons of ''Survivor.''

''What a weird thing it is to be potentially a victim of your own success!'' Mr. Burnett said.

Of course, USA Network, which will telecast the four-night coverage of ''Eco-Challenge'' for the first time this year, cannot resist mentioning ''Survivor'' as much as possible in its promotion of ''Eco-Challenge: Borneo,'' looking to capture at least a fraction of that Burnett magic. And attention given to the series has surely increased because of ''Survivor,'' with televsion industry executives watching closely to see how potent ''Eco-Challenge'' proves to be in the cable world. Mr. Burnett only hopes that no one expects a show on cable to attract the huge audiences that ''Survivor'' has drawn to CBS.

Despite his understandable resistance to having the CBS and USA audiences compared, Mr. Burnett has no reservations about matching up the production values of the two shows. In fact, he said, the two have come to complement each other in ways that have improved both.
