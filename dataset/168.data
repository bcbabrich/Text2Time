WASHINGTON — President Trump’s calls this week for more vocational schools have received a lukewarm reception from the higher education community, including from the educators who teach in the programs he is championing.

The president first raised expanding vocational education in his State of the Union address on Tuesday — the only nod to education policy in the speech — as a work force development strategy. On Thursday, Mr. Trump expounded on the proposal, asserting that efforts to teach students trades had diminished since he attended an elite military boarding school, where he said he had a classmate who wasn’t the “greatest student” but “was able to fix a car engine blindfolded.”

“He had a different kind of a talent, and we should have vocational schools,” Mr. Trump said during a speech at a Republican congressional retreat in West Virginia. “You learn mechanical, you learn bricklaying and carpentry and all of these things. We don’t have that very much anymore. And I think the word ‘vocational’ is a much better word than in many cases, a community college. A lot of people don’t know what a community college means or represents.”

Policy experts and organizations that advocate the trade programs — which for more than a decade have been recognized as career and technical education, or C.T.E. — took issue with the president’s antiquated characterization of a sector of higher education that has expanded beyond laborers who are not cut out for academia.
