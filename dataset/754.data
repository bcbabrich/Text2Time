“Solipsistic? Navel-gazing? Vainglorious?”

Thus read an email from an esteemed colleague, trying to help out as I moaned about having run out of adjectives to describe the unrelenting egocentricity on “Girls.”

But alas my problem remained unsolved, and not just because I’d already used the word “solipsistic” last week in the recap of the episode, “Dead Inside.”

Part of the issue was that little of note seemed to happen this week in the episode “Only Child.” Did the characters seem to be flailing in a vacuum?

Much of the episode was devoted to Caroline and Adam’s bickering. Jessa isn’t really doing anything; applying for a job at a kids’ clothing store pales alongside the taut banter she shared with a fellow rehabee at the season’s outset. Marnie and Ray break the friend code by sleeping together, which might rankle more if it felt that more was at stake. Shosh remains nearly unintelligible, though she did — wait for it — urge Jessa to grocery shop and condition her hair.

And while it is good and well that Hannah and Adam are happy together, does it seem like the coupling has done away with some much-needed will-they-or-won’t-they frisson?

Fresh faces contributed to some of the funnier scenes. Among them, the back and forth between Hannah and mourning wife of David, the deceased apparently bisexual book editor, culminating in Hannah basically getting hoofed from the funeral. And her meeting with the maniacally cheerful frenemy editors provided some bounce.

“Well I’m from the Midwest. So I’ll always be 15 to 45 pounds overweight depending how far I live from the coast,” Hannah says, to their delighted squeals, after they ask her to describe herself and her brand. “So I guess my brand is Tombstone Pizza?”

When HBO held its premiere party for this season at Jazz at Lincoln Center, it screened three episodes – 1, 2 and perhaps tellingly, episode 7. Having not gone to the party, I’m holding out for episode 7. In the meantime, I’ll be quietly mourning the fact that crazy kinetic screen-stealing Caroline was given the boot by Hannah. Am I alone on that front? Then again, as a reader noted last week, maybe Tina Fey, in her sendup of the show on Saturday Night Live last fall, was on the mark. Maybe it’s time to bring in Blerta.
