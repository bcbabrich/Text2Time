A Congressional commission questioned Goldman Sachs and American International Group executives on Thursday about the way the companies set prices on complex mortgage securities during the financial crisis, when buyers for such assets were scarce.

The panel’s chairman pressed Goldman on whether its negative bets in the market became a “self-fulfilling prophecy,” The New York Times’s Gretchen Morgenson and Louise Story report.

Goldman was among the most aggressive players on Wall Street in marking down the value of mortgage bonds as the financial crisis brewed, and ultimately benefited in protecting itself from the housing downfall. A.I.G., on the other hand, had a large positive bet on housing through the billions of dollars of mortgage securities that it insured for Goldman and other banks.

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission is investigating Goldman’s relationship with the American International Group in a two-day hearing as part of its broader study of the causes of the financial crisis. For more than a year before the government bailed out A.I.G., Goldman demanded cash from the insurer, based on Goldman’s lower valuations of mortgage securities. A.I.G. battled Goldman in an epic dispute but ultimately surrendered and sent much of the requested money.

The four executives on the panel testifying Thursday — two from A.I.G. and two from Goldman — were intimately involved in the dispute that ensued between the insurer and Goldman over those valuations. In addition, the commission questioned regulators from three different offices about the role of A.I.G. and derivatives in the crisis.

The hearing was just the latest public questioning of Goldman executives about the bank’s role in the mortgage market. The commission on Thursday shifted attention to the way Goldman valued mortgage securities and how that affected the broader market.

The chairman of the commission, Phil Angelides, pointed to Goldman’s bet against housing to question whether the firm itself could have been affecting the market, through its position and its marks on companies like A.I.G.

“Look, you guys are net short, and you’re driving down prices — are you guys creating a self-fulfilling prophecy?” Mr. Angelides said. “Were you in fact pushing the market down?”

Goldman’s chief financial officer, David Viniar, said the bank did its best to estimate market pricing and that it did not move the market through its trading, claiming Goldman was a small player in the mortgage space.

“I think there’s a misperception that we move the market,” he said. “We’re a participant in the market.”

Market prices did move in Goldman’s direction in 2008, though many of the deals A.I.G. insured have been recovering and doing better since 2008, when they were transferred to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as part of the government’s $182 billion bailout of A.I.G.

The hearing revisited a debate on valuation that was prevalent at the height of the crisis, when many financial companies complained that they were being forced to take oversized losses on assets because of the market panic. The vice chairman of the commission, Bill Thomas, focused his questions on the models that A.I.G. used. He asked the A.I.G. executives why they preferred to use their models for pricing rather than market pricing when Goldman was demanding cash.

Andrew Forster, the chief financial officer of the unit at A.I.G. that issued the insurance on the mortgage securities, said he did not believe the prices in the market three years ago were accurate.

“If you’re in a liquidity gap at a time when people do not want to add risk, personally I don’t think you should mark all your positions to zero,” Mr. Forster said.

The commissioners asked Goldman to follow-up with additional information, including the identities of the third-parties that provided insurance to Goldman on A.I.G. as a company. Goldman has pointed to that insurance as the safety net that would have covered Goldman if A.I.G. had failed.

Another commissioner asked Goldman to provide details of any communications the bank had related to the legal waiver

it and other banks received during the bailout. That waiver blocks lawsuits between the banks and A.I.G. related to the mortgage securities that are now held by the Fed.

In a second panel, Eric Dinallo, the former superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department, spoke about the Fed and the Treasury’s choice to pay off banks like Goldman in exchange for their mortgage bonds. Mr. Dinallo said it would have been better for the government had guaranteed those deals and left them on A.I.G.’s books.

Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, also testified, and he advocated for passage of the financial reform legislation. Clarence K. Lee, a former official with the Office of Thrift Supervision, also testified.
