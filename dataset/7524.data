HOUSTON, Nov. 30 — The New York Yankees finally upstaged the New York Mets today by drafting Dulce Carmel, the hard‐hitting first baseman and outfielder of the Mets’ No. 1 farm club, Buffalo.

The 20 big‐league teams then drafted a record number of 59 first‐year players at $8,000 each from one another's farm clubs, with the Yankees and Mets taking one each. The Yankees chose Eliseo Rodriguez, an 18-year‐old catcher from the Bronx. The Mets with room for only one new player on their bulging roster.” drafted Bob Nash, a 20-year‐old outfielder from Wellsville in the New York‐Pennsylvania League.

The Kansas City Athletics were the first to draft a player for $25,000. They picked Jim Dickson, a 26-year‐old righthander who compiled a 9-3 won‐lost record last season with the San Diego Padres and had been up briefly with the Houston Colts in 1963.
