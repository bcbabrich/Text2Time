Wanda Sykes is becoming the latest comedian to dip a toe into the late-night television pool, signing a deal with Fox to host a show on Saturday nights. In a news release, the network said Ms. Sykes would host a topical program, which is expected to start in the fall, that would include panel discussions about current events. Ms. Sykes’s show may act as a replacement for “Mad TV,” the sketch comedy show that was shown at 11 p.m. on Saturdays until it was canceled last year. The Fox announcement also calls into question the future of “Talk Show with Spike Feresten,” which is hosted at midnight on Saturday by Mr. Feresten, a former “Seinfeld” writer. Fox declined to comment on the status of Mr. Feresten’s show, and did not announce a time slot for Ms. Sykes’s debut.
