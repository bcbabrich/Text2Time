Those who get as much of a jolt from money as they do from caffeine can find both at the new ING Direct cafe at 45 East 49th Street. Instead of bank tellers behind bulletproof glass, there are baristas behind the counter in the company's bright orange cafe. The same person can show customers how to open a bank account or apply for a loan online while dispensing one of the best cups of coffee around. The coffee comes from Peet's, the popular Bay Area roaster known for its dark, full-bodied beans. It's $1.50 for a cup of coffee; espresso-based drinks range from $1.75 to $3.50. Open an account and the coffee is on the house. ING Direct, the North American affiliate of a Dutch bank, also has Internet-linked bank-cafes in Europe, Australia and Canada. The branch here sells Peet's beans at $9.95 to $12.95 a pound, and it's the only place you'll find them in New York City.
