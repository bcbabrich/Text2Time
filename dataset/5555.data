At least three major United States carriers - Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines and Northwest Orient Airlines - have continued to offer discounts on flights to England even though the British Civil Aviation Authority ordered the discounts stopped last Thursday.

This is the second time the overseas airlines have defied the British agency. In October 1984 the agency had ruled that super-saver fares put in the month before were to be rescinded. All the carriers continued to offer the fares, however, until mid-December, when the authority threatened to fine carriers for every passenger found traveling on the disapproved fares.

The lag between the disapproval and the threat of any concrete action in that past incident may be encouraging airlines to sell past the current deadline, analysts said. First Move

The airlines also seemed to be waiting for the others to make the first move to stop offering the discounts.
