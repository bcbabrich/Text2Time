ERIC LEWIS, KEN FREED, JOHN DEXTER and CHRIS FINCKEL have been training off and on for six months and seriously for another month, stretching, exercising and getting in shape -- to play Shostakovich.

They are members of the Manhattan String Quartet, and tomorrow at 10 A.M. they will begin a 12-hour marathon at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.

They are to play all 15 of the composer's string quartets. "When you put them all together, they read like a Russian novel," Mr. Lewis, the first violinist, said. "We get a description of the betrayal of the revolution, of Soviet life and oppression and of his hope that in the future, humanity would be restored."

Doing the quartets with three one-hour intermissions is exceedingly taxing, Mr. Lewis said. "So we've been preparing as if we are athletes, with lots of stretching and yoga," he said. "Still, there is always the possibility that someone will faint or need oxygen or a neck brace."
