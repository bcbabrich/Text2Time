A Soviet diplomatic team has arrived in Zimbabwe to set up an embassy and formalize relations with the Government of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, whom the Kremlin refused to support during the seven-year civil war.

A Government spokesman and the Soviet charge d'affaires, Vladimir Silkin, both said they were happy that the mission was finally being established. Western nations and China established embassies almost immediately after Mr. Mugabe assumed power 14 months ago.

In the war between black nationalist guerrillas and the white minority regime of Rhodesia, the Soviet Union refused aid to Mr. Mugabe, preferring to support his rival, Joshua Nkomo.
