PARIS, March 31—Seventyfive years ago today the last bit of iron was put into place and the French Tricolor was raised over what was to become one of the highest and bestknown landmarks in the world ‐the Eiffel Tower.

Except for a suicide, the 329th in the history of the tower, it was business as usual today on the anniversary of the 1,052‐foot structure.

Little British schoolgirls and Belgian air cadets munched sandwich and cakes and drank tea in the warmth of the cafe on the second landing, 377 feet above the ground.

The cold and haze did not stop the visitors who formed long lines in front of the elevators from the ground to the second landing and then to the top landing 899 feet above the ground.
