Police officers traded gunfire with a man in Brooklyn yesterday, wounding him after what witnesses said was a fight between rival gangs.

The violence began shortly before 9 p.m. on Franklin Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. According to the police, officers responded to a report of shots being fired. They saw a large group involved in a dispute, and then a man the police identified as Tyrell Williams, 22, of Brooklyn pulled out a .32-caliber pistol, the police said.

Mr. Williams fired into the crowd, the officers said. The officers identified themselves, and Mr. Williams, along with another man, Allen Waters, 28, also of Brooklyn, began running down Franklin Avenue.

Mr. Williams then turned and fired at the officers, missing them, the police said. One or both officers -- it was not yet clear -- fired back and wounded the young man once in the hand and once in the buttocks. The officers grabbed Mr. Williams' gun and arrested both men.
