The following report compiles all significant security incidents confirmed by New York Times reporters throughout Afghanistan from the past seven days. It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials refuse to confirm casualty information. The report includes government claims of insurgent casualty figures, but in most cases these cannot be independently verified by The Times. Similarly, the reports do not include Taliban claims for their attacks on the government unless they can be verified. Both sides routinely inflate casualty totals for their opponents.

At least 51 pro-government forces and eight civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the past week. The casualties of pro-government forces and civilians decreased this week, possibly because of the cold weather in most parts of the country. The Taliban attacks were most concentrated in Kandahar Province, where insurgents carried out four attacks, killing 15 members of security forces and one prosecutor. Six police officers were killed in two insider attacks in Kandahar and Kunduz provinces. The bloodiest attack took place in Zabul Province, where 12 police officers were killed in Taliban attacks on their outposts.

Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president, speaking last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said 45,000 members of the security forces had died since he took office in September 2014 — a much higher total than anyone in his government had previously acknowledged. Additionally, a new report released by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction said that the Afghan government’s control of its country declined late last year, in terms of both territory and population.
