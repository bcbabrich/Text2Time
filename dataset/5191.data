The seven-year-old Wilkinson's Seafood Cafe needs more publicity about as much as lobsters need mittens. On weeknights this inviting little neighborhood spot has an easygoing cadence: it is busy enough to be sociable, yet calm enough to offer intimacy. If it were not my job to blow the cover on such places, I'd keep it to myself.

Aside from the setting, what lures Upper East Side regulars here is sprightly seafood cooking and smart, unobtrusive service. Andrew Tun, the Thai-born chef, has an affinity for Oriental preparations, which, when successful, can be light and spirited. His few failures are attributable to creativity at the expense of cohesion.

The dining room, behind a friendly little bar, would not win any interior design awards - it is a jumble of brick grotto and pastel-shaded contemporary, with medieval-looking art hanging next to country trompe-l'oeil murals - but somehow the composite is still appealing. A casually well-dressed Yorkville crowd drifts in nightly about 8.

My favorite starter here has always been the tender ring-sized fried calamari with a side of tarragon tomato sauce. Instead of the undistinguished seafood salad, try the heaping plate of tart arugula in a good vinaigrette garnished with big grilled shrimp, or the same greens with delicious little slices of sweet Chinese pork sausage. Soups are uniformly good, from the visually dramatic puree of roasted red peppers with mussels in their shells to a combination of salmon and meaty Manila clams in a creamy seafood stock. Fans of New England clam chowder might find the rendition here a bit precious - the clams are arranged around the plate in their shells - but the light broth is packed with flavor. One of the chef's more inventive successes is called scallop hash, a thick patty of golden cubed potatoes and rare-cooked scallops infused with fresh thyme. The wine list carries 22 well-chosen whites, but most are stiffly priced. Among the more reasonable are the 1987 Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay, Russian River ($26), and the 1988 Cakebread Cellars Sauvignon Blanc ($25).
