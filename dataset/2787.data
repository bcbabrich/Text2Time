To the Editor:

Re ''Rebuilding Iraq With Iraqis'' (editorial, June 29):

It's unfortunate that our government had so little preparation for the war in Iraq. The media-glorified, three-week march to Baghdad is long over, but the war is nowhere near finished.

The Defense Department is so ill equipped to provide humanitarian aid that our government needs to give up a little egotism and let the United Nations help out. The Defense Department is in the business of destruction, not nation-building.

Also, we need to have a little faith in the Iraqi democracy. Not every Iraqi politician needs American backing. We need to let Iraqis discover their government without being imposed upon by Western ideals.
