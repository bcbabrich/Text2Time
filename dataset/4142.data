The President, Ronald Reagan, had just raised his left arm to wave to the crowd standing on the rain swept sidewalk outside the Washington Hilton Hotel when John W. Hinckley Jr. opened fire. It was March 30, 1981. Mr. Hinckley, a 25-year-old mentally disturbed gun enthusiast, fired six shots at the Presidential entourage. Mr. Reagan suffered a near-fatal wound to the chest. His press secretary, James S. Brady, was hit above the left eye. Two other men were wounded. It was an old, old story. The insanity of gun violence, a crippling and seemingly incurable American disease, had flared again.

Fourteen years later the National Rifle Association, a fanatical organization that is awash in the blood of homicide and suicide victims, is accelerating its never-ending fight to expand the arsenal of guns in America. Weapons manufacturers in the U.S. are turning out more than 500 guns an hour, but the N.R.A. and its political henchmen are not satisfied. With the leadership of the Republican Party in its pocket, the N.R.A. is fighting for the repeal of virtually all existing gun control laws, including the ban on assault weapons.

Never mind that all of us are at risk, from the President to the poorest infant in the poorest neighborhood in the land. Never mind that 37,502 people were killed by firearms in the U.S. in 1992 -- more than 100 every day. Never mind that Colin Ferguson was able to legally purchase the 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun that he used to kill 6 people and wound 19 others on a Long Island commuter train. Never mind that 14 people were shot to death in a post office in Oklahoma in 1986, or that 21 people were shot to death in a McDonald's in California in 1984, or that 4 people were shot to death in a post office in Montclair, N.J., just last week.

Never mind any of that. The goal of the N.R.A. remains as simple and as mad as ever: to put guns into the hands of as many Americans as possible.
