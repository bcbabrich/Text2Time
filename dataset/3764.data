Trying to Save a Nephew

While Dying of AIDS

'A Not So Quiet Nocturne'

Vineyard Theater

In ''A Not So Quiet Nocturne'' by Jaye Austin Williams, a deaf woman who has lost her husband and a baby daughter to AIDS and is herself dying of the disease decides that her great project before she dies is to save a teen-age nephew from the drugs and violence of the streets. And in the Onyx Theater Company's production, Michelle Banks, with the simplest gestures and statements, creates a character of almost unbearable emotional power.

This company, which specializes in theater by the deaf and presents plays in combinations of sign language and speech, continues to set very high standards for innovation in making the whole range of human expression as available in silence as it is in voices.

For this play, which the author directs, it needs all the ingenuity it can muster. Ms. Austin-Williams apparently cannot bear to leave out any detail of the life of any character, and there are many. As both author and director, she also seems to approach the story thinking of movies more than plays. There are more than 40 short scenes in less than two hours, with blackouts every two minutes or so while stagehands shift large objects around in the shadows. It is like having furniture movers constantly interrupting an intense emotional confrontation.

So it is a tribute to this large and buoyant cast that the play's central idea -- that life's richest times are brief and quiet -- comes through so memorably.
