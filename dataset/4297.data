The Japanese students, Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, were shot in the head on March 25, shortly after they drove to a Ralph's supermarket in San Pedro for some late-night shopping.

In a case that has attracted international attention, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams announced the arrests at a news conference late Wednesday night -- in time for the 11 P.M. news in California and before the evening news in Japan, where the killings of the two film students have confirmed the prevalent view there that the United States is a gun-toting, crime-ridden country.

The killings were not racially motivated, Mr. Williams said.

"The young men were not targeted because of their ethnicity, the fact that they were students, or the fact that they were visitors," he said.

"We want to send a message to everyone who lives in Los Angeles, who visits Los Angeles, both locally and abroad," he added. "The city of Los Angeles is still a great city; it's a wonderful place to live; it's a wonderful place to work. It is not the most violent city in America. It is not the most violent city in the world." 'Lots of Pieces Missing'

The police offered few details about the case, apart from saying that the suspects had been identified on Monday and placed under surveillance. Mr. Williams said investigators had got "some breaks," but he would not say whether they had recovered any weapons or what had led them to the suspects.
