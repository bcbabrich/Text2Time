Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery yesterday by Vice President Al Gore to the International Press Institute in Boston, as provided by the Gore campaign:

Twenty-five years ago today, the last helicopters lifted off from the roof of our embassy in Saigon. Although that brought an end to the war in Vietnam -- a conflict I witnessed with my own eyes -- it did not bring an end to its influence on our thinking about foreign policy.

Even now, a decade after the end of the cold war, we hear echoes of the old arguments. Some seem to believe that with the fall of the old Soviet empire, we have nothing more to fear in the world and should dramatically cut our defense budget. Others keep insisting that we continue to prepare to face down a cold war threat that no longer exists and persistently ignore the world as it is. I believe that both groups are locked in a self-destructive argument over a false choice. . . .

We are now in a new era. . . . We are now in a global age. . . .

We need a new security agenda for the global age based on forward engagement. . . .

In the global age, we must be prepared to engage in regional conflicts selectively -- where the stability of a region important to our national security is at stake, where we can assure ourselves that nothing short of military engagement can secure our national interest, where we are certain that the use of military force can succeed in doing so, where we have allies willing to help share the burden and where the cost is proportionate. America cannot be the world's policeman. But we must reject the new isolationism that says: Don't help anywhere, because we cannot help everywhere. . . .
