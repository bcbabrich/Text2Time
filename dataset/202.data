But her submission also reminded me of how much can be learned when journalism becomes more communal and conversational. I would never have known about cakes like the “Maypole” or “Rocking Horse” — nor would I have known they were such cultural touchstones — if not for our attempt to throw open the doors, and invite in readers’ stories. Your stories.

Looking back over the past year, there are so many things I wouldn’t have known if not for readers of this newsletter.

The responses to last week’s Australia Letter about history taught me just how common it was to grow up in Australia years ago without being taught Indigenous history — something I hadn’t realized since my own children are receiving more of that education in their public school.

If not for all of you, I also wouldn’t have grasped the depth of appreciation for Nippers, nor the nuance and divisions that shape discussions of race and multiculturalism, or gender and power.

I would have missed out on many great books, restaurants, music and movies that many of you suggested; I would have misunderstood the rivalry among Australia’s capital cities, or the degree to which people care so much about those that are often overlooked — I’m looking at you Darwin, Adelaide and Perth — if not for those who wrote to tell us what they loved about where they lived, and why.

I could go on but the point is, for our first anniversary, I’m not going to boast about all the journalism we did that I’m proud of, though there’s a fair amount of that.

I’m just going to thank you for making the journalism better.

Foreign correspondence is nothing if not an attempt to understand, and our bureau’s understanding of Australia — even for those who are Australian — has occurred at an accelerated pace thanks to you.
