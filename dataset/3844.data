To the Editor:

''Limo Life, From the Front Seat'' (news article, June 24) reminded me of a continuing crisis in New York: air pollution. How often do we see limos gathered, with engines running while drivers chat on the sidewalk? When informed of a law that limits engine idling to three minutes, most drivers claim ignorance. And enforcement is nonexistent.

This is a curable cause of pollution. Are you listening, Police Commissioner Safir?
