The houses are very old, among the oldest and most gracious somehow left standing in a city whose watchword has been nonpreservation. Old they are, but not too old to celebrate the Second Annual Historic House Festival, which is to start tomorrow and continue next weekend.

The festivities are presented by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the 16 house museums where the events are to be staged. The project involves a broad range of activities, from musical adventures to crafts fairs and lectures. Visitors will find not only diverting programs but also residences that recall New York in different eras and styles. A sampling here gives the flavor. Most of the events are free. For more information: 360-8123 or 360-8163.

In the Bronx, at 1 P.M. tomorrow, one may meet the ''Ghost of Mr. Van Cortlandt,'' who will give personal tours at his house in the park of his name at Broadway at 242d Street (543-3344). From noon to 4 P.M. on Sunday, demonstrations of weaving, spinning and the use of herbs are intended to catch the flavor of life in this 1748 mansion, which George Washington visited.

The Morris Jumel Mansion in Manhattan was built in 1765 as a country home, and has survived to become a quiet enclave in itself, at 160th Street near St. Nicholas Avenue (923-8008). From 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. tomorrow, the mansion is to celebrate its 225th anniversary, with songs, storytelling, history tours, a concert of early American and Afro-American stories and songs and re-enactments of famous duels (one resident, Aaron Burr, killed Alexander Hamilton in such an encounter). Admission to the house: $3; students and the elderly, $1; children under 12, free.
