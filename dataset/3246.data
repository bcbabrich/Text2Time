''Should I or shouldn't I?'' It's a question millions of women ask themselves these days, as baby boomers near or recently past menopause try to decide whether to take hormone replacement. Joining them are millions of older women, many of whom have been taking estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin for years and wonder if it is wise to continue, as well as many others who wonder if it is wise to start.

At issue is an oft-repeated finding that the use of hormone replacement is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, especially when the hormones are taken for upwards of 10 years or more. Although heart disease ultimately kills six times as many women as breast cancer and the cancers linked to hormone replacement tend to be highly curable, there is an emotional factor to consider: justifiably or not, breast cancer is the disease most feared by American women.

A new study, reported last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that, although estrogen has long been considered the main hormonal risk in breast cancer, progestin may be a more important factor. The study, by scientists at the National Cancer Institute conducted among 46,355 postmenopausal women, found that in lean (but not in heavy) women, taking estrogen with progestin was associated with an 8 percent increase in breast cancer risk with each year of use, as opposed to a 1 percent increase when estrogen alone was taken.

Likewise, a study conducted in Los Angeles County by Dr. Ronald K. Ross and colleagues at the University of Southern California among 1,900 postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 1,600 healthy postmenopausal women found a substantially higher risk of breast cancer when progestin was combined with estrogen for hormone replacement therapy than when estrogen alone was taken. This study is scheduled for publication this month in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
