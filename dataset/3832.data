How do you spell war? At The New York Post, a picture is worth a thousand polysyllabic synonyms.

On Friday, newspapers across the nation published photographs of Rebecca A. Sealfon of Brooklyn Heights, the National Spelling Bee winner, leaping triumphantly, a yellow placard identifying The Daily News as her sponsor hanging broadly across her chest.

Like many papers, The Post printed an Associated Press photograph of Rebecca. But ever the gladiator in the tabloid arena, it erased the name of its competitor.

The A.P. does not manipulate photographs and prefers others to follow a similar policy, said Vincent J. Alabiso, its executive photo editor.

Arthur Browne, managing editor of The Daily News, had some fighting words. ''It strikes me as the act of a newspaper suffering from a deep inferiority complex,'' he said. Editors of The Post did not return calls. DAVID M. HERSZENHORN
