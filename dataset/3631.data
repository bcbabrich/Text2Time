In the strongest show of support to date for the embattled Microsoft Corporation, 26 computer industry executives have written to the Justice Department saying that any delay in the introduction of Windows 98 will harm the computer industry.

''Our success depends on the freedom of Microsoft and the rest of America's personal computer industry to create new and innovative products,'' their letter says.

The support for Microsoft comes at a time when attorneys general from 13 states are close to preparing a joint antitrust action against Microsoft, apparently aimed at blocking the release of Windows 98. The next version of Microsoft's operating software for personal computers, Windows 98 will be shipped to computer makers starting this month and is to be released to the public by late June. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has been pressing its own suit against the company.

The executives' letter, which was sent to Joel Klein, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, contends that delaying the operating system would affect the more than two million programmers who write software for Windows-based computers, as well as an equal number who work in the computer services industry. The executives said that a delay would also injure the makers of hardware and peripheral products.
