Talking About Drinking Parents and young people who are concerned about reasonable and responsible alcohol consumption will find helpful suggestions in a little booklet called ''Let's Talk About Drinking,'' published by the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. The association contends that while alcohol-education programs sponsored by schools, churches and community organizations are all well and good, they must be complemented by family dialogue. To that end, the booklet offers suggestions on how to approach a topic that is often fraught with emotional issues, especially struggles for control between parents and their maturing offspring.

The tone of the pamphlet, which was prepared with the advice of Dr. Gail Gleason Milgram, director of education at the Rutgers University Center for Alcohol Studies, is thoughtful: ''A good suggestion is for parents to talk to each other before talking with their children. It also is important that parents consider their own use of alcohol beverages and understand that this use has been observed by their children.''

The booklet stresses the importance of avoiding contention. ''Parents,'' it says, ''should remember that discussions with their children are not to win arguments over who is correct. This will only create confusion and conflict.''

The booklet is available free from the Wine and Spirit Wholesalers of America, Attention: Families, P.O. Box 57008, Washington, D.C. 20037. Animals and FACT
