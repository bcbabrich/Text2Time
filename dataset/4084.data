It was muddy and chilly, and their request for bleachers, television platforms and tents had been ignored by park officials. But for the men and women who pride themselves on camaraderie, derring-do and a high tolerance for ale, nothing could spoil yesterday's rugby tournament in Central Park.

Hundreds of the world's best rugby players sprinted up and down the pitch -- the field, in American football parlance -- as they fought for the title in the New York Sevens Tournament, one of the largest in the country. No ordinary rugby match, it is a faster version of the conventional game, less about strength than speed. As the name suggests, each half lasts seven minutes and each side has seven players.

But the rest, the unabashed ruggedness of the game, remains the same. Taking up five fields in the North Meadow, men and women scrambled in their now-so-fashionable striped shirts, wearing next to nothing in the way of protection and accouterments. No pads. No clunky helmets. No adhesive nose strips to make breathing easier.

So it was not surprising that little vexed the players about the snub -- not the fact there was no grass on the field, or no place to change but the windy sidelines, and no doubt that, had this been football or soccer, things would have worked out differently. Rugby's popularity is growing in the United States, especially on college campuses, but it has not caught on with everyone.
