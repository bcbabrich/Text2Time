Some awkward arrangements of his pieces in the early middle game in the 14th encounter of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship gave Vladimir Kramnik trouble yesterday in London, but he struggled through to an endgame that was salvageable and got the draw that maintained his two-point lead over Garry Kasparov.

With the score now at 8 to 6 in favor of Kramnik, he needs only one more draw to win the match and the $1.33 million prize.

Kramnik had to drop a pawn, but escaped into an ending where that margin was not sufficient to cost him the game.

Game 15 is scheduled for tomorrow at 3 p.m. London time.

For the first time in the match, Kramnik chooses the English Opening, of which he has long been a connoisseur, and Kasparov meets it with the Double Fianchetto Variation.
