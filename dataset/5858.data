For married Hindus, men and women alike, cremation is the normal procedure for disposing of the body. There is no specific time element involved, but in most cases the rite takes place within a day of the death.

Those who are unmarried may be buried.

Preparation of the body usually entails bathing, anointing with a mixture of water and sandalwood and daubing with turmeric powder and water. The body must be garbed with new cloth. Flowers, incense and rose water enhance the bier.

Priests, or Brahmans, chant ritual forms, called mantras, along with the family, and ritual offerings of rice and milk are made to the Brahmans. Soon the body is removed to the cremation grounds, usually on the banks of a river.

By custom, the eldest son presides at the cremation in the company of a priest. The ashes are collected and deposited in one of India's holy rivers. For the next 10 days, family members are considered ritually impure and normally remain in the home. By the end of that time, the soul of the deceased is believed to have acquired a new body, and the consequences of the last life, its rewards and punishments, are unfolded.
