“Britney: For the Record,” the MTV documentary about Britney Spears, which was shown Sunday night, turned out to be a pretty big disappointment. No question was supposed to go unanswered but still there are lots of questions, like, how come Britney Spears let one of her toddlers pretty much drive a car? She was sad. She was lonely. She was having a hard time. But how is she doing now? She has no regrets. Everything happens for a reason. It is what it is. This is Britney reflecting. Madonna steps in momentarily to do some analyzing for Britney and when she does, she sounds like Harold Bloom in comparison. Britney can’t go excavating deep inside but also, she has a problem with English. When did Kevin Federline start to disappear from her life? When “he started doing an album for his-self.” She knows she is to blame for some of her misfortunes but she also wants to blame photographers because “paparazzi has taken my whole cool slang away from me.” Whoever is out there with Britney’s cool slang, you know who you are, now, go give it back.
