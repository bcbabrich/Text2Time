Most works of such sumptuousness were seen in churches in the Middle Ages. It is not known if the candlesticks were ordered for a church or simply donated to it, as they have no religious symbols, but Mr. Blumka is confident they once adorned an altar.

''They are of very high quality,'' said Timothy B. Husband, a curator at the Met who saw them. ''We have a pair of Limoges enameled candle prickets at the Met, but they are not as fine.''

Mr. Blumka added: ''The Louvre has a foot of a single candlestick of this type, not the whole thing. Mine are important because a pair is extraordinarily rare. I've never seen another pair from this period.

''They are also important because of their date, 1160. The earlier the Limoges, the better the quality. At the beginning, the workshops were small, and one person tended to do everything. Later on there were factories where different people specialized in enameling, incising or gilding.'' The price for the pair is $750,000.

Naturally most of the works in the show are religious art. The most touching may be the high-relief panel depicting the dying Mary on a bed surrounded by the 12 apostles. Titled ''The Dormition of the Virgin,'' the polychrome lindenwood relief, circa 1510, is attributed to Jörg Lederer, a master carver from Germany. Until 1925, it belonged to John and Mable Ringling of Sarasota, Fla. Coincidentally, it passed through Julius Böhler's hands in 1935.

''What's rare in this period is sculpture that is attributed,'' Mr. Blumka said. ''We don't know the names of that many artists.''
