Every morning, by the dawn's early light, thousands of starlings take off from their perches in the magnolia trees around the White House. They fly to Virginia and Maryland to spend the day on the job, which is mostly eating bugs and worms.

At the twilight's last gleaming these reverse commuters fly back home to the White House.

They are hardly welcome there because of the mess and noise they make, especially around the patio of the South Portico, facing the Mall.

The birds have outlasted all attempts at eviction, but Irvin Williams, the chief horticulturist of the White House, says he has not given up. ''You can watch them any morning or night,'' said Mr. Williams. ''They fly over Tyson's Corner by the thousands on the way to and from feeding in the countryside.''

Mr. Williams said that about a year ago he heard that snakes would scare the birds away. He put two inflated toy snakes in the branches of two magnolia trees. ''It worked for about two weeks,'' he said. ''Then they realized the snakes weren't doing them any harm, so they came back and just ignored the snakes.''
