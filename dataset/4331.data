A drug commonly given to transplant patients offers the first new treatment in 40 years for victims of severe ulcerative colitis and can often spare them removal of their colons, a study has found.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic bowel inflammation that results in bloody diarrhea and other symptoms. When steroids fail to stop the disease in a severe case, doctors almost always have to remove the patient's colon.

The study showed that the transplant drug, cyclosporine, was effective in people with severe ulcerative colitis who had not responded to steroid drugs, the last medicine introduced for severe forms of the disease.

The study, led by Dr. Simon Lichtiger and conducted at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the University of Chicago, is being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
