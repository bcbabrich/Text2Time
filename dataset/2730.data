Financial regulators have ordered J. P. Morgan Chase & Company to stop trading on its own account for 10 business days, starting March 3, as a penalty for violation of stock trading regulations. The Financial Services Agency said J. P. Morgan sold a large amount of stock to depress the price of financial instruments called exchangeable bonds. The infraction occurred in January 2001, the agency said. Ken Belson (NYT)
