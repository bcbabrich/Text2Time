The typical weekend music festival, especially for those long of tooth and cranky of pants (say, mid-30s or older), can be a Dante-like dystopia: interminable lines, overzealous security, unreasonably priced and inedible food, watery beer, claustrophobia-inducing space, one-dimensional sounds and even port-a-potties (gasp!). This weekend, however, a far more user-friendly and multifaceted confab is thankfully smashing the hackneyed concert mold.

All Tomorrow’s Parties (ATP), the independent British music festival, makes its third annual appearance this weekend an hour and a half northwest of Manhattan at Kutsher’s, the wondrous and dilapidated Borscht Belt resort (and putative inspiration behind the film “Dirty Dancing”). This year’s lineup includes Iggy Pop and the Stooges performing their third album “Raw Power,” the hip-hop pioneer DJ Kool Herc and the reunited doom metal band Sleep. Ticket sales are capped at a comfortable 2,000, and attendees have the run of the hotel’s relatively spacious grounds, which by itself puts ATP head and shoulders above other similar fests — but that’s just the music half of it.

How many rock festivals have a book club? Jim Jarmusch, the film director and this year’s guest co-curator, posted a reading list on the ATP Web site that includes “The Job: Interviews With William S. Burroughs,” Luc Sante’s “Kill All Your Darlings,” Nick Tosches’s “Years Before Elvis” and Samantha Hunt’s “The Invention of Everything Else.” Two of the authors, Sante and Hunt, will give readings and discuss their work with Paper Magazine’s Carlo McCormick.

Much in the same way, Jarmusch himself will be interviewed by Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore (the James Lipton of noise rock) on Saturday night on the topic of crime wave film. The director is presenting a series of felonious-filled black and white flicks like Kubrick’s “The Killing,” von Sternberg’s “Underworld” and Aldrich’s “Kiss Me Deadly.” The movies are being shown in conjunction with the Criterion Collection, the repackagers of classic and contemporary film who at each ATP host their own cinema.

If excellent music, literature and classic films inexplicably aren’t your bag, ATP offers other visual stimuli: Tim Biskup and Eric White collaborate on paintings and prints based around a high-concept (and possibly imaginary) television program; Ricky Powell, the photographer and Beastie Boy associate, will present a slide show with images of hip-hop’s early years; and various comic illustrators are reimagining Criterion’s film selections as comic book covers.

It’s rather ironic that members of Shellac, one of alt rock’s most intense bands, are acting as ATP’s quasi-recreational counselors. For the third straight year, the producer and musician Steve Albini is hosting a card game out of one of the resort’s suites, and the group’s bassist Bob Weston is organizing a pick-up baseball game. For a more cerebral respite, music wonks can show how they’ve enriched/wasted their lives at a music trivia contest and at something called “Tom Waits Bingo.” While that may sound hilarious, it’s probably not as funny as Todd Barry, who headlines Friday night’s comedy stage along with Heather Lawless and Hannibal Buress.

This year, ATP wisely stole a page from the Brooklyn Flea, recruiting the market’s lauded food vendors to hawk comestibles beyond the beer and dogs. Offerings include Asia Dogs (mango, peanuts and cilantro wiener, anyone?), Pizza Moto (with their own mobile brick oven), Chonchos Taco’s (known for its fish tacos) and, perhaps most important of all, Crop to Cup, the perfect cure-all to a long weekend of intensive culture consumption.

“ATP is like an excellent mix tape,” says Barry Hogan, who founded the festival a decade ago. “Each one is different and reflects a different person’s cultural interpretations and tastes — that’s the reason why it has been going so long.” And without a port-o-potty in sight.

All Tomorrow’s Parties runs Sept. 3 to Sept. 5.
