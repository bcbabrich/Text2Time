John M. Todd, a Roman Catholic publisher and scholar who wrote sympathetic studies of Martin Luther and John Wesley, died at his home in Somerset, England, on June 9. He was 75.

In 1959, after several years as an editor at Longmans Green, Mr. Todd and two other members of the publishing concern left to found Darton, Longman & Todd, an ecumenical religious publishing house. As Catholic editor, Mr. Todd published Karl Rahner, Yves Congar and Henri de Lubac among European theologians as well as the Canadian Bernard Lonergan and the Indian Raymond Panikkar.

Overshadowing all the concern's other publications, however, was the 1966 Jerusalem Bible, a new popular English translation modeling itself on a translation done by French scholars in the 1950's.

Even before the Second Vatican Council opened a new era of ecumenical ties between Christian churches, Mr. Todd's own books, "John Wesley and the Catholic Church" (1958) and "Martin Luther: A Biographical Study" (1964), had departed from the polemical attitudes long marking Catholic studies of Protestant leaders.
