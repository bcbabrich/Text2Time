After 19 months of violence that has claimed around 1,400 lives, some of South Africa's black activists say they are seeking to complement their campaign against white rule with alternatives to official control at the local level.

The strategy does not imply expectations of an immediate black takeover of the Government, but seems focused more on creating activist bodies to replace white, official control of black schools and towns.

In townships in the restive Eastern Cape, for instance, the activists say, the violent destruction of Government-sponsored black community councils has been followed by the creation of what are called ''people's committees'' charged with running the affairs of separate streets and areas and with spreading a radical political message.

The committees, run by militant blacks, seem still to be shadowy organizations, but they fit a pattern.
