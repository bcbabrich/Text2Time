A heavy psychological bent and rural settings characterize the works of many of the older writers. Probably the most venerated among them in intellectual circles is Juan Benet, who has written a cycle of books placed in the fictitious ''la Region.'' His most recent book, ''In the Penumbra,'' is an experimentally ambitious one about a woman who for three years refuses to receive a messenger bearing what she is sure is bad news.

'Values Are Dead'

The younger writers, those under 40, tend more to reflect on the confusion and estrangement of modern city life and often have an eye for absurdity, parody and irony, much like the movies of the popular film maker Pedro Almodovar. The young Mr. Mugica's ''Going Crazy'' is the story of a man who awakens to find his longtime girlfriend dead in bed next to him. Over the next months his despair turns to disillusionment as he learns she was not the person he thought she was.

''I write about desperation because values are dead and there is no God to resuscitate us,'' Mr. Mugica said.

As they try to reach out to the once-ignored public, the under-40 writers put emphasis on plot and the telling of a good story. That emphasis, however, has prompted the single real literary debate here. Intellectuals grumble that much of the new writing is ''lite literature'' - a lot of air, little substance. Mr. Benet said that in place of plot he prizes ''language with grace, with power, with metaphorical capacity.'' He accused many of the emerging popular writers of having ''few literary virtues'' and kowtowing to an increasingly ''degraded'' public.

Mr. Cela recently weighed into the debate, characterizing the younger writers as generally being ''catechism novelists, very disciplined, very obedient, with their hands always out to see if the Government will drop them some loose change'' in prizes and scholarships.

It was vintage Cela, for at the same time he admitted that he had not read their works - or hardly anyone else's in recent decades.

Defenders of the new writing retort that such criticism smacks of ''intellectual classism.'' Many of the younger writers, influenced by traveling and by the droves of translated American and European books arriving here as part of Spain's new prosperity, say they have learned that literature can be both serious and popular. The better books use plot and action to evoke more fundamental reflections.
