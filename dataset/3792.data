The announcement of the deal -- four of the state's nine major tribes, including the largest ones, have not yet agreed to it -- came a day before the state had planned to begin implementing its court-approved tax-collection plan. That plan would have allowed the state to collect taxes from non-Indian cigarette and gasoline wholesalers before they sold their goods to Indian retailers. The cost of the taxes would then be passed along to the retailers and then to their customers.

Gov. George E. Pataki today expressed satisfaction with the agreement and said his aides would continue negotiating to reach a compromise with the leaders of the four tribes that are holding out. ''This important breakthrough represents real progress toward a long-term solution of a problem that many had thought impossible to resolve in part because the previous administrations had failed to reach any kind of agreement,'' Mr. Pataki said today.

The owners of hundreds of gasoline stations and convenience stores near Indian reservations had been pressuring the state to collect the taxes for years.

The agreements were reached with Onondaga Nation near Syracuse, the Oneidas Nation near Utica and the Tuscarora, Tonawanda and Cayuga Nations, all outside Buffalo. The tribes that have not signed the tentative agreement, who have the most at stake, were the St. Regis Mohawks near the Canadian border, the Seneca Nation outside Buffalo and the Shinnecock and Poospatuck Nations, both on Long Island.

''The Senecas have not taken a position on whether we will or will not reach an agreement with the state,'' said Susan Abrams, the executive assistant to the nation's president. ''I don't think the Seneca Nation will ever be interested in becoming a tax collector for the state.''
