As my colleagues Anahad O’Connor and Robbie Brown reported earlier, Hurricane Earl weakened to a Category 3 storm early Wednesday with winds of 125 miles per hour, but evacuations have begun along the Atlantic coast ahead of the powerful storm’s expected impact later this week.

A spokesman for the National Hurricane Center told The Associated Press that a storm this powerful has not threatened such a large area of the East Coast since Hurricane Bob in 1991.

At 8 a.m. on Wednesday the National Hurricane Center in Miami issued its latest advisory on Hurricane Earl, with this updated forecast of the path it could follow in the days ahead:

According to the center, a hurricane watch is in effect for North Carolina and Virginia from north of Surf City, N.C. to Parramore Island, Va. including the Pamlico and Albermarle Sounds. A tropical storm watch is in effect for the North Carolina coast from Cape Fear to Surf City. In addition, a tropical storm warning is in effect for San Salvador Island in the central Bahamas.

Even if the storm does not make landfall it is powerful enough to cause damage on shore, with destructive winds and currents.

The A.P. reports that tourists in North Carolina are lining up to leave Ocracoke Island on the state’s Outer Banks, as forecasters said the storm appears likely to approach Cape Hatteras on Thursday.

A new video report from the news agency notes that the hurricane is currently projected to deal a glancing blow to the northeastern United States, perhaps hitting Cape Cod, Mass., and the Maine shoreline on Friday night and Saturday.

On Wednesday morning the National Hurricane Center also issued a new advisory on Tropical Storm Fiona, which is intensifying as it approaches the northern Leeward islands. The center issued warnings to several islands in the Caribbean in Fiona’s path and provided this image with its latest Tropical Weather Outlook advisory for the Atlantic Ocean, showing the current location of the two storms and a possible new one forming behind them:
