EH, what's up, Doc?

Jigsaw puzzles -- Looney Tunes Cosmic Capers Animated Jigsaws, a puzzle collection culled from the intergalactic travels of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Marvin the Martian. Snap the puzzle pieces together, and the image becomes an animated cartoon from the Warner Brothers vaults. Seeing ''Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century'' fragmented, reconstituted and animated on a computer monitor, one realizes that a bunch of deranged 40-something cartoon characters are the vanguard of convergence.

But then, we already knew that.

As with any toy transported from the physical world to the computer screen, there is the question of whether a digital interface adds anything to the experience. In this case, it does. Putting together a jigsaw puzzle, particularly the cardboard variety, is an abstract undertaking. It's about memory and spatial perception and pattern recognition. You sort things by color, find the corners, assemble the edges, put together the obvious clusters, then fill in the gaps. When you snap two pieces together, the primary payoff is the ''aha'' realization that they fit, followed by a tactile sense of completion when you mash them together with your thumb.

The virtual version elicits the same puzzle-assembly behavior. (Those sorting strategies are so universal and instinctual, one half-suspects that a jigsaw gene is lurking somewhere in the cipher of human DNA.) The ''aha'' moment is identical. Instead of tactile feedback, there's a sound effect to punctuate the moment when pieces lock together. Essentially, it's the same kind of payoff -- some sensory reassurance that the pieces fit, a validation of your insight. In digital translation, a jigsaw puzzle doesn't lose much.

And it gains a lot. For one thing, it's replayable. Unlike the cardboard image, which loses all attraction once it is assembled, the digital image can be recast as a different puzzle (or displayed as computer wallpaper). There are 48 different patterns, from conventional cut-out shapes to square and round configurations, which are surprisingly difficult because they lack the usual interlocking puzzle parts. This game makes you realize how much ''pure logic'' really comes down to habit.
