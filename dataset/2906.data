Mr. Butler ran the union with a strong hand, and many union members said a victory by Ms. Charles would be a major upset.

''The first thing I want to do is rebuild our union, rebuild its morale,'' said Ms. Charles, 45.

The election has involved charges and countercharges, with Ms. Charles criticizing Mr. Butler for allowing the voting to take place at just one site -- a community center on 144th Street -- rather than at sites across the city. She also criticized him for handpicking the committee that oversaw the election.

Mr. Butler insisted that he did nothing wrong and abided by the constitution of Local 420, one of the 56 locals in District Council 37. At its peak Local 420 had about 20,000 members, but it has shrunk along with the number of workers in the city's public hospitals.

Concerned that the Butler forces might miscount the ballots or stuff the ballot boxes, an ally of Ms. Charles telephoned District Council 37's ethical-practices officer, Barbara Deinhardt, at 3 a.m. yesterday to ask her to seize the ballot boxes. She rushed out to sequester the boxes, which she has kept in in her possession.

Many union members have criticized Mr. Butler for collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a new union headquarters. But the planned site for the headquarters is still an abandoned building.
