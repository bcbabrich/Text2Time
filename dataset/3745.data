The New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association is expected to name a new head coach within the next few weeks, according to Maureen Coyle, the team's director of public relations.

But there was considerable speculation yesterday that the team had already found its man.

Richie Adubato, a former head coach with the Dallas Mavericks, Orlando Magic and Detroit Pistons and a former assistant with the Knicks, Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers, was the name being mentioned as highest on a very short list of candidates.

The Liberty fired Nancy Darsch as coach in September after the team lost its last regular-season game, missing a shot at the playoffs. In 1997, the W.N.B.A.'s first year, the Liberty made it to the championship round before losing to Houston. LENA WILLIAMS
