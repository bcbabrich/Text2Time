Following is a third and final set of answers from Curtis Gathje, a writer and editor, who took questions on the history of The Plaza hotel over the past week. The Plaza turned 100 years old today. Mr. Gathje, who is the New York City editor of the Zagat Survey’s restaurant and nightlife guides, worked at The Plaza for 25 years and was the hotel’s official historian. He is the author of the book “At The Plaza: An Illustrated History of the World’s Most Famous Hotel” (St. Martins, 2000). His first and second sets of answers were posted on Wednesday and Friday of last week.

Many stories from historic hotels involve scandal and intrigue. What is the most scandalous story that has emerged from the 100 years of operation of the Plaza?

It didn’t take long for scandal to hit the Plaza: Six weeks after it opened, on Nov. 15, 1907, the celebrated Mrs. Patrick Campbell checked in. A star of the British stage, Mrs. Pat (as she was known to her fans) was renowned for her outspoken opinions, eccentric behavior and close friendship with the playwright George Bernard Shaw. Following a news conference in her Plaza suite, she went downstairs to the Palm Court for dinner. After finishing her meal, she extracted a perfumed Egyptian cigarette from her bag, lit it and smoked it, in public. Women did not do such things during that era, and a waiter immediately appeared and insisted that the cigarette be put out. “My good man,” Mrs. Pat legendarily replied. “I understand this is a free country. I shall do nothing to change it.”

A compromise of sorts was arranged, and a screen brought out so that her misdeed would not offend the other diners. Somehow the press caught wind of it, and the story further fueled the ongoing debate about the evils of demon tobacco. Several years later, New York City banned smoking on its subways, a law said to have come about as the result of Mrs. Pat’s folly.

I heard that many people, such as Frank Lloyd Wright, would stay at the Plaza for extended periods of time. Are there any long-term guests that you found especially memorable, and why?

Kay Thompson, author of the “Eloise” books, is one of the hotel’s more fascinating long-term guests. Thompson, who was a singer and dancer as well as a writer, first appeared at the Plaza in the 1950s as the star of a cabaret act in the hotel’s Persian Room. The character of Eloise, the formidable six-year-old who some say was Thompson’s own inner child, was developed during these performances as an in-joke with her band. After the illustrator Hilary Knight made a drawing of the tiny minx, it was decided to immortalize the character in print, and the first “Eloise” book was written in 1954 in Thompson’s hotel suite. The book was an immediate hit, spawning three sequels and a slew of commercial tie-ins – dolls, recordings, and a children’s clothing line, as well as an Eloise room and ice cream parlor in the hotel itself. In return for this marketing bonanza, Thompson was given a gratis Plaza suite in which to live.

Things went sour in the 1980s when new owners examining the books decided that the lost revenues from Thompson’s suite weren’t equaling what the Eloise merchandising was bringing in, and some poor soul had the unfortunate task of asking Thompson to pony up. Instead, she stormed out, never to return, taking the various tie-ins with her. Thereafter, Eloise’s only presence in the hotel was the Hilary Knight portrait hanging opposite the Palm Court (on loan from the artist). When Thompson died in 1998, her heirs resumed the Eloise merchandising in full force.
