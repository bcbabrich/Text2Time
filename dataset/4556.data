And guaranteed, McCarthy, a limited partner as well as Steinbrenner's tax lawyer, must win approval of other teams before he can officially assume leadership of the team. So the partnership must wait and see if that is possible. And nothing that is been tried by that group, by Steinbrenner, by Kleinman, to this point has proven to be successful.

Steinbrenner has made it known to the commissioner he wants to petition for reinstatement. Vincent has said that won't happen until all the lawsuits go away. The one filed by McCarthy and another limited partner, Harold Bowman, did, in mid-December. But Kleinman's $30 million suit against Vincent has not, in part because Vincent refuses to promise that action won't be taken against Kleinman for his having sued in the first place.

And Steinbrenner's $30,000 suit against a transcribing company is still alive, also, because assurances against repercussions or hints about favorable rulings on reinstatements cannot be secured from Vincent, either. The uncertainty is again causing Steinbrenner to apparently hint at new legal action even as he still tries to clear away the two old suits.

Vincent, when asked if he felt there were any immediate questions concerning McCarthy's nomination, said yesterday evening: "Sure there are. One arises from the fact that he sued me. The second comes because he lives in Cleveland. But at least the Yankees have made a choice. I and the members of the ownership committee will look carefully at Mr. McCarthy's situation."

A lukewarm endorsement, indeed. And guaranteed, it won't get any warmer just because the Yankees, in announcing McCarthy's nomination, took steps to allay concerns over baseball's "local residency" requirements for ownership by saying the 67-year-old Cleveland lawyer plans to move to the New York at some point, as yet unspecified.
