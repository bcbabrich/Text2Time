To the Editor:

Re “Visions of Trumptopia” (editorial, March 1):

President Trump made an admirable attempt at being a statesman in his first speech to Congress on Tuesday night, but a controlled Donald Trump is still Donald Trump. It is far too late to fool us by putting on sheep’s clothing.

President Trump used an expanded vocabulary in his speech in an effort to sound presidential, admittedly with some success. But beneath the artificial veneer still lies the soul of a man who lacks compassion and is grandiosely self-promoting.

One speech does not a president make. We still cannot see the president’s tax returns, his multiple conflicts of interest have not been properly addressed, and a full investigation of possible Russian ties will likely never happen with a Republican-controlled Congress.

President Trump failed to convince me that he is working for the American people. His desire for rollbacks related to food and drug protections, clean water and financial regulations shows a man who is anything but a servant of and for the American people.
