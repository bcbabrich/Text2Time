Three more things to know about the process: First, no article is guaranteed publication. Everything is written on spec. This applies to all articles, even those we commission. (Op-Ed is not a one-way street. We frequently call up people and invite them to write for us.) Second, what comes to Op-Ed stays in Op-Ed. Your ideas are not passed on to our Times colleagues for their use. Third, because we receive so many submissions, we cannot respond to everyone who sends us an article. If you haven't heard from us within three business days, you should assume that we are not going to be able to use your submission.

Are there guidelines for submitting an article? You bet. Shoot for about 750 words -- though it's worth remembering that some terrific and influential Op-Ed pieces have been as short as 300 words. Move quickly, the news does. Eschew, um, I mean, stay away from Olympian language and bureaucratic jargon (infrastructure, inputs, outlays). Write the article the way you'd like to write it -- not the way you think The Times wants you to write it. Make one argument thoroughly, point by point; the more detail the better. If you try to do too much, you can wind up with an article that, in striving to say everything, ends up saying nothing.

Also, you shouldn't feel that you have to rely on the written word alone. Maybe your point is expressed best in a chart, a graphic, an annotated illustration or a series of photographs. We're open to just about anything, so long as it's acceptable in a family newspaper. (Open letters to the president don't have a great history of success.)

A few other guidelines. Submissions must be exclusive. If you want us to consider your work, please send it here first. We don't publish articles that have appeared in other American publications, and we rarely publish reprints of any kind. Contributors generally must let several months go by between appearances on the page. For more information on the submissions process, please see the box at the end of this article.

What happens once an article is accepted? It will start with a phone call or an e-mail message from an editor at Op-Ed. You'll be asked to sign a contract giving The Times the right, among other things, to distribute the article online and via other newspapers. Once the article has been scheduled for publication -- it could be days or even months after acceptance -- we'll edit and fact-check your work. Then we'll send you a copy for review. Nothing appears in the paper until the writer has signed off on the edited version.

There are, however, two zones of editorial privilege. We choose the illustrations, which are created by artists to complement specific articles and are overseen by our art director. And we write the headlines. Contributors have no say in these matters. (You're in good company -- Times reporters don't write their headlines, either.) At the end of the day, you'll receive a moderate payment.

All of our writers are obviously opinionated about their subjects, but we try very hard to make sure our readers know if they have a financial or professional interest. Contributors are asked a lot of specific questions toward that end. In addition, we try to give readers enough information -- the dateline and identification line, for example -- so they can find out more about writers if they wish. Sadly, mistakes happen. When they do, we do our utmost to correct them quickly. (Op-Ed corrections appear on the Op-Ed page.)
