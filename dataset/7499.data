WHAT price fashion? From $22.95 to $89.95, Bloomingdale's answers succinctly.

This is the price range for the American interpretations of dresses, suits and coats designed by Valentino Garavani, the current darling of the Rome couture.

The Italian designer, clad in a black cashmere jacket, tan slacks and blue shirt, smiled appreciatively as the inexpensive versions of his styles were paraded through the import stop of Bloomingdale's Down‚Äê stairs Store at a press show earlier this week.

Valentino, who is 30 years old, will be on hand today to present the collection to the public. He has headed his own couture house for the last four years.

Instead of the beaded exoticisms that sent the audiences applauding in Italy this summer, Valentino's collection for Bloomingdale's emphasizes the kind of clothes that the business girl or housewife can wear all through the day. Slender and shapely, they curve in toward the body in front and hang straight at the back.
