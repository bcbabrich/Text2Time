An Afghan civilian was killed and four others were wounded when a bomb apparently aimed at a United States military convoy exploded on the edge of the eastern city of Jalalabad, a police official said. The bomb was on a bicycle and went off at noon, just after the convoy had passed. There were no American casualties, said a spokesman for the Jalalabad police chief.
