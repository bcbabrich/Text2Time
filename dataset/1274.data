Puzzle note: For online solvers, a PDF is also available since Across Lite can’t display the foreign alphabets used in three of the clues (it uses English-letter transliterations instead). Here are the three clues:



Note: A personal farewell follows this post.

I’m a happy camper to have this puzzle to talk about as my final Wordplay post.

We get all sorts of entertaining themes on Sundays, but what it really boils down to is having a good, solid idea that’s fun to solve — something clever and different — and that’s exactly what we have today from David Levinson Wilk. In short, it’s good in places — that is, “good” in places that speak English, “gut” in Germany, “bonne” in Geneve and “hea” in Estonia. (The theme is more fully explained below.)

That said, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The bottom quarter of the puzzle slowed me down considerably, with NILE BASIN and I’M WAITING going in right at the end (a nice pair, those). When I then looked at 120 Across, it took a moment to realize CSINY was CSI: NY.

Over in the bottom right, what do we think of “90% off?” for SENILE? I’m not so sure about that one.

As for the theme, I’ve got to admit I only 90 percent grasped what was going on when I finished the puzzle. Thinking it through a little further, I then saw that each book, film or song title follows the pattern: ___ IN [a city or country]. A translation of the first part of the answer appeared in the clue (in the pertinent language). It was a very nice moment when the light fully dawned.

So “AN AMERICAN,” as one would say it IN PARIS, would be “Une Personne des États-Unis.” Likewise, “Érase una Vez” is “ONCE UPON A TIME,” IN MEXICO. Funniest is how a Brooklynite would say “A TREE GROWS” — “Whaddya Tink? A Sapling Stays a Sapling Fuhevah?”

The international flavor of the theme follows through in the fill, as evidenced by these words in the clues: Norwegian, Lisbon, Spanish, Turkish, German, Bahraini, English, Japan, Korean, Cuba, Galicia, French, Parisian and Iberian. And there are other references, plus SPAIN and IRAN in the grid.

Stay tuned Monday for your new Wordplay blogger, Deb Amlen.
