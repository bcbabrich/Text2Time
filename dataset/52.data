Now it’s empathy that’s the thing with feathers. Or that’s the perception of the impenetrably thick-skulled men who rule the workplace in Mara Nelson-Greenberg’s “Do You Feel Anger?,” a fitful comedy with an ingenious premise, which opened on Tuesday night at the Vineyard Theater under the direction of Margot Bordelon.

“Empathy? Isn’t that a type of bird?,” asks Jon (Greg Keller), a boss at a debt collection agency, with what appears to be genuine cluelessness. Jon is speaking to the newly arrived Sofia (Tiffany Villarin), a counselor who has been brought in to teach his team the value of compassion.

Just before posing that question, Jon had been extolling his company’s new maternity leave policy: “We let women leave when they’re giving birth.” And no, that’s not a joke either. What Jon and his male co-workers — the short-tempered Howie (Justin Long) and the self-described poet Jordan (Ugo Chukwu) — find genuinely funny turns out to be a lot more inane, and a lot scarier.

Ms. Nelson-Greenberg has had the inspired notion of translating everyday sexism into the ostensibly nonsensical language of absurdism, as it was practiced by the likes of Eugene Ionesco, the young Edward Albee and, more recently, Christopher Durang. In the testosterone-saturated world of “Do You Feel Anger?,” words have been uprooted and mangled to the point that they now convey only the most atavistic impulses.
