Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised the city's public hospitals yesterday, asserting that the quality of care they provide is so good that poor New Yorkers receive better medical service than wealthy patients at private hospitals. Speaking at an interfaith prayer breakfast at the New York Public Library, the mayor was extolling the virtues of living in New York City when he mentioned the quality of service offered by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. He said the city's public hospitals and medical centers "are something I am so proud of."

"This city has 11 public hospitals, and every rating agency says these are the best hospitals, better than the great teaching hospitals we have in this city," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Medical care in this city is arguably one of the few services you can point to any place in the world where the poor get better services than the wealthy. It really is true. If you get sick you go to a public hospital. Every single number shows we've done a spectacular job."

Mr. Bloomberg's enthusiasm has been on display before, and health care is a favorite topic of his. Amid budget cuts elsewhere, he increased city funds for public hospitals, and he has contributed millions of his personal fortune for a school of public health at his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University.

But his claim that the city-run hospitals are superior -- and that as a result their mostly poor patients receive better care than people who go to private hospitals -- proved difficult to test. Yesterday being observed as a holiday, officials at several large private hospitals were not available to comment. Nor were federal officials who collect Medicare and Medicaid data.
