On the fourth full day of camp, Coach Joe Walton came up with yet another variation today in his attempt to change his philosophy about coaching the Jets. For the first time so early in training camp, the players worked out in shorts and T-shirts rather than long pants and heavy pads this morning. They returned to regular gear for the afternoon session.

Walton said with all the changes the team is making on defense, he had not had time to work on the nickel defense or at blitzing.

The Jets continue to be hampered by slight muscle pulls, with the strong safety Russell Carter and the cornerback Bobby Jackson being the latest victims. Both missed practice this morning, and although they went out on the field with the rest of the team for the afternoon session they did not do any work. ''The fast guys will have trouble with little muscle pulls,'' Walton said between practice sessions.

The coach said Joe Fields, the center, suffered separated ribs in Tuesday's practice and would miss the first exhibition game, Aug. 10 at Giants Stadium against the Philadelphia Eagles.
