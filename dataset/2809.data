It's always hard to tell just what ends and what begins on Labor Day. Schoolkids have the best answer, because for them a change of life is coming right around the bend. A surprising number of adults, with or without school-age children of their own, also feel the echoes of the educational calendar, as if the first few days of September still meant new teachers, new classrooms and the strange sense of starting over and picking up right where you left off.

In summer we search for a kind of stasis -- an uninterrupted expanse of time, even if it only lasts for part of an afternoon now and then. But with Labor Day another instinct kicks in, a love of transition. It's one of those moments when we look up from whatever we've been doing and notice, often in unfeigned horror, how many days deep into the year we really are. There was never any possibility of going backward in time, but somehow the year didn't seem quite so irrevocable on Memorial Day as it does on the 1st of September.

Labor Day is a traditional marker in an increasingly nontraditional flow of time. All the old calendars -- from school, church and farm -- reinforce the strong seasonality of human experience. But all the new calendars -- of business, information, entertainment and politics -- insist on the unbroken continuousness of time, the never-ending utility or diversion in every passing moment. Most of us can feel the tension between the old and the new calendars, even if we only notice it from time to time. The paradox of Labor Day, which we try to honor by ceasing our labors, nicely catches the way those calendars collide in our lives.

It may well feel like summer for the next few weeks, but it's a different kind of summer. The light comes later in the morning and goes sooner in the evening, and the sun cuts a lower track across the sky. It's easy to pretend that such incremental differences don't have much effect on us anymore, now that we live in a world that never stops ticking, buzzing, beeping, humming and glowing. But they do. The cities that engulf us may look artificial, but they're inhabited by beings who feel the ancestral pulse of time and change. Labor Day comes and goes in a flash, but it's long enough for us to sense the calendar tipping toward fall, toward whatever fall will bring.
