AMES, Iowa – Call it post-New Year’s fun or pre-caucus jitters, but Hillary Rodham Clinton’s sense of humor – which her friends often recommend when trying to “humanize” her – was clearly on display today.

Perhaps she was trying not to think about the Des Moines Register poll results, but Mrs. Clinton was quick with the punch lines this morning. Nearing the end of months of campaigning in Iowa, she likened the grueling process to a “consumer’s union.” (Her other line, about letting people look in her mouth like livestock for sale, got fewer laughs.) She trotted out her folksy story about boiling frogs with special panache, and milked the foibles of the Bush-Cheney administration with relish. She even used technical troubles as a source of punch lines. And the crowd of 750 ate it up.



On Dick Cheney’s hunting mishap earlier this year: “The vice president shot somebody,” she said, to guffaws in the audience. “I thought, ‘I’ll never be surprised or shocked again.’”

On a roar of approval coming from the adjoining room, when no one in her room made a sound: “That’s the overflow room. Either that, or it’s the end of a great New Year’s Eve party, I’m not sure which.” More chuckles.

On feedback from the speakers: “I was in Muscatine yesterday in the middle of going on about the Bush administration, and the microphone completely died. I said, ‘I know they’re a little obsessed with me, but this is getting absurd.’”

She killed.
