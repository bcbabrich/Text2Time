Norris Embry Snyder Fine Art 20 West 57th Street Manhattan Through Dec. 9

As an artist, Norris Embry was somewhere between an insider and an outsider. Born in Louisville, Ky., trained in art school (he studied with Kokoschka, no less), he exhibited in galleries and museums in New York until his death in 1980, at 59, so he was not an outsider in that sense. But his works were also an expression of his schizophrenia, and his mental illness links him to outsider art.

The works are wild, raucous paintings and collages made up of newspaper clippings and obscure diaristic writings combined with looming faces, random shapes and doodles. Sometimes the works just collapse into headlong chaos. Mostly, there was method to Embry's madness. The colors are refulgent purples, blues and reds, and the images have an almost incantatory quality in their obsessive, layered construction. Above all they seem genuine, which means they can make you cringe at their anguish at the same time that they win you over through their exuberance and apparent faith in the exorcistic potential of art. Clearly, art for Embry was a profound release. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN
