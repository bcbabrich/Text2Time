Child welfare officials also pledged to sort out the agency's performance in the case of Delores Tucker. According to case records, a report of potential abuse or neglect was made to the state child-abuse hot line on Oct. 10. The anonymous report contended that the Tucker apartment was filthy and that domestic violence might have been a problem.

Agency workers familiar with the case files said that a caseworker made 11 separate attempts to contact Ms. Tucker and her children, but that the caseworker was successful in only about half the instances. Detectives said the caseworker had discovered crack vials and inadequate food in the apartment. One agency worker said that records indicated that the caseworker concluded that all three children were being maltreated and that a notation of substantiated abuse was filed on Nov. 13.

Other agency workers said that they had seen no such formal finding.

The records indicate that the caseworker's efforts at dealing with the family were complicated by the fact that Ms. Tucker often gave bogus addresses for where she or the children could be found, and at least once sent the caseworker to a fake address when the worker asked to examine Delores. They said that the caseworker once threatened to have the children taken away in an effort to force Ms. Tucker to make a scheduled meeting, but that this failed.

The records indicate that as recently as Dec. 19, the caseworker was actively trying to track down the mother and children. The preliminary case records, however, make no mention of an effort to enlist the police or others in an effort to monitor the household.

Detectives said last night that in August Ms. Tucker allowed Delores's stepfather in Queens to care for the infant and that Delores had only returned to the Bronx apartment two weeks ago. But they said as many as six neighbors were being interviewed who gave accounts of Ms. Tucker's mistreatment of Delores.

The detectives said the surviving children had told investigators that their mother had beaten the three of them regularly. The detectives said the two older children were also marked by signs of abuse, including burn scars and other bruises.
