NAIROBI, Kenya, May 31—Kenya's Minister for Tourism and Wildlife said today that the Government would follow up its ban on big‐game hunting with a program to crack down on poachers, whose activities are a major cause of the dwindling of the country's wildlife.

While conceding that legal hunting accounted for the deaths of only 6,000 animals last year, the minister, Matthew J. Ogutu, said the ban would enable game wardens to spot poachers more easily, since killing of any kind would now be outlawed.

In the past, he noted, hunters and poachers used the same kind of weapons and operated in the same areas, and so it was difficult to distinguish between them. “Now, anyone found killing breaking the law,” he said. “The Government has the long arm to stamp out the poachers.”

The minister said that $2.9 million would be spent on helicopters, LandRovers and radios to step up his department's antipoaching patrols. The World Bank is supplying the money.
