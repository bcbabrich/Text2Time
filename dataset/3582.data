The owners of dogs that bark in New York City will face tougher sanctions, female golfers in Connecticut will gain new privileges at their country clubs and smokers in New Jersey will pay higher tobacco taxes, as dozens of new laws take effect today in a mixed bag of new taxes, rights and prohibitions.

In New York State, a law gives cats the same legal status as dogs, horses and cattle, at least when they are struck by a car or truck.

''Parity for cats is a great way to start the New Year,'' said Thomas P. DiNapoli, an assemblyman from Great Neck who sponsored the new law and describes himself as ''a cat person.''

The law increases the fine for hitting cats and leaving the scene to $100, up from $25. A judge may order violators to pay up to $150 for a subsequent offense.
