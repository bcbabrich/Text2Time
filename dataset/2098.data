ATHENS, Ga. — He is on the cover of the Oklahoma State media guide and he is scooting through the Georgia defense for big plays. N.F.L. scouts are watching him from the edge of their seats. He has been called the best player in the Big 12.

What’s his name?

The public address announcer in the Georgia press box says he is Adarius

Brown. He is actually Adarius Bowman, the Cowboys’ 6-foot-4 wide receiver who

had four catches for 65 yards in the first half Saturday night. After halftime adjustments, we’re sure Bowman

will become his name again.

More important than the announcer is what kind of adjustments Georgia will make. Bowman lines up in the slot and attacks the middle of the defense. He draws linebacker help, which creates space for tight end Brandon Pettigrew, who had three catches for 26 yards in the first half.

It makes you wonder. Tennessee lost its three best receivers and the Vols

are searching for a playmaker. Bowman is from Chattanooga. He is not a late-bloomer, having been rated the fourth-best player in the state in high school. Tennessee simply didn’t get him. He went to North Carolina and was suspended for

violating team rules, and then transferred to Oklahoma State.

We’ll see tonight when Tennessee plays Cal, but the Vols could use a guy like

this. So could some N.F.L. teams. Watch this guy. The ball is on

the way, his hands are at his side, the defensive back doesn’t know the

ball is on the way, and Bowman reaches up and snatches it.

The Cowboys are good. A lot of weapons, a hurry-up offense that can catch teams off-guard. This is a dangerous team that might just be 8-4 because of schedule that has them playing at Texas A&M, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.
