Recognizing a smallmouth bass from a largemouth bass is easy if the angler has one of each kind in hand. But if not, it should be remembered that a vertical line drawn through the eye of a bass will pass behind the mouth of a smallmouth. It will pass through the mouth of a largemouth.

Another and surer method is to count the number of rows of scales from the median line of the dorsal fin on the back. The median line runs along the side from the mouth to the tail.

On a smallmouth there will be 11 rows, because its scales are smaller than the largemouth, which will have seven rows.

Other fish to be sorted out include the pickerel, pike and muskellunge. First of all, the misnamed pike, is not a pike at all, but a member of the perch family. It differs from the others in that it has two separate dorsal fins. Its eyes have a glassy look; hence the name.

The pickerel has scales all over the cheek and the gill covers.

The pike, often called the northern or great northern, will have scales on the cheek like the pickerel, but on the gill cover only the upper half will be scaled.
