Re: "Talk Radio Bulldog Is Really Just a Pussycat, Friends Say" (Nov. 27), an article about Bob Grant:

He's a wonderful man, and he loves dogs and children. Where have we heard that one before? The ages have provided us with countless figures who were sweet to their families, friends, dogs and followers, while they were causing terrible trouble for the innocent. Mr. Grant is a very intelligent person who knows exactly what he's doing.

His endless tirades and personal name calling are renowned. It should not have taken an election to bring them out for discussion.

Do you really think it's such a wonderful thing that he goes to the diner and listens quietly to the hoi polloi? Does the fact that so many of his constituents agree with him make him right?

Mr. Grant has been ignored by targeted politicians and the news media alike. A very big mistake. I believe his success was used over the last decade by the conservative elements as a standard for setting up radio personalities all over the country. They didn't help anyone get elected, but they certainly contributed to the defeat of many candidates, some good and some bad.
