Ford Motor stands alone among Detroit’s Big Three in dodging a shareholder-crushing government bailout. If automobile sales continue to slide, that may be a short-lived accolade. If not, it is a testament to the carmaker’s hard work, smart financial planning and competent management, Breakingviews says.

So what does it get for its virtue? So far, not much, the publication says.

President Barack Obama gave Ford’s products a plug and its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, a slap on the back when announcing new emissions standards last month, it notes. But the competitive advantage the government’s life-support package would give General Motors, as well as the billions it has injected into Chrysler, must worry Ford, Breakingviews suggests.

After Ford’s two domestic rivals emerge from swift trips through the Chapter 11 car wash, they will have cleaned up their legacy cost problems and scaled back their dealer networks in ways that Ford, outside of bankruptcy, cannot. As G.M.’s majority shareholder, the government has an incentive — perhaps even a fiduciary obligation — to favor G.M., Breakingviews asserts.

To dispel that notion, the government would have to level the playing field, the publication says. But there’s not much it can do. The White House could expedite the “cash for clunkers” bill that is wending its way through Congress and speed up the arrival of cheap Energy Department loans to help develop fuel-efficient vehicles.

And it should continue to bolster the financing markets that Ford Motor Credit depends on to make loans to buyers, Breakingviews suggests. These measures would help all carmakers. But if Ford is smart, it can use its status as the only financially virtuous domestic carmaker to good advantage in its advertising as a way to scoop up greater market share, the publication argues.

The government, Breakingviews says, can do one thing to specifically help Ford: give fast-track approval to its finance unit’s application to open an Industrial Loan Corporation. That would allow Ford Motor Credit to collect deposits and lower its financing costs — matching the advantage that Chrysler’s and G.M.’s financing partner GMAC has as a bank holding company.

Aside from that, Ford is on its own. The good news is that its executives have already demonstrated restructuring savvy, Breakingviews says. Combined with what little help the government can give, Mr. Mulally may be confident enough to keep Ford competitive without resorting to the bankruptcy court, it says. If not, all the company’s virtuous diligence will be for naught.
